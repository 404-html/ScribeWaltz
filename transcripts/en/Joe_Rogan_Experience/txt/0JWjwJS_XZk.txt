Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Three, two, one that a gun. That's a real gun. Gentlemen. We're live. It'll be all right. Yeah, thanks. [inaudible]. How are you fuckers doing great man. It's great to be on the show again. Great to have you guys here. Um, you know, I was watching your instagram the other day and I was looking at you with fake hips doing crazy fucking heavy dead lifts. Man, that's amazing. I am starting to dead lift a little bit more because I've been doing this carnivore diet and I feel great and there's no reason not to, right? So, um, I just figured if I can do it and it doesn't hurt, Diana, why not? So, uh, I was going up until about 400 pounds, but I think I can still, I think I can even get stronger now. So what I am so happy about is this is something squatting and deadlifting.

Speaker 1:          00:00:46       It's something that was part of my life all growing up. I was a power lifter all growing up and he's the one who got me into this shit and it, it got taken away from me and I was really sad and disappointed. Became a drug addict and an alcoholic because of it. And now I can lift again. So I feel good. Is that unusual for someone who's got artificial hips to be able to do something like that? Um, do you know how many people don't know that I have artificial hips? Well, I do know that Ed Cohen, who is the greatest power lifter of all time, he has two fake hips now, right? Yeah, I think so. I think he's still squat 600 gs at Eddie cone. Check him out. He's a beast. Fake hips squatting 600 pounds. It sees that. It's like one of the most effective replacement surgeries that they do is replacing.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       Yeah, I think it's a great and a big deal. I think it's a great surgery. Before I got it done, I mean I couldn't even get up out of a chair. I was, I'd be stuck, you know, I stick places and um, before I got it done I couldn't really move at all. And then after I got it done, they had botched one side. So one side went perfect. The other side for two years was all screwed up and the doctors didn't know it. What was screwed up about it? Um, the, the cup, there's a cup and then there's the ball that goes into the cup. The Cup came loose and it would, it would shift around. Now they think that the cup comes loose because when you do both hips at the same time, they hammer one hip and the one side and then you're completely like a dead body almost and they flip you over and it's really an island actually when they flip you over, they think that's when the hit might that that socket may come out.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       So they're starting to to question doing them both on the same day. Now, yeah, I've heard of people getting one done and then a couple months later I would recommend getting one done because then when I got my other one, when I got the one that was messed up redone and I had one good leg and one, you know, one leg to recover on, it was so much easier. I didn't have to have the special toilet and all the other students are going to be on crutches instead of being in a wheelchair. Probably right. If you only had one bathroom. I actually wasn't even on crutches. I came home from the hospital and that day that I came home from the hospital I was, I was walking, I even climbed a ladder and our mom yelled at us and yelled at me because I climbed the ladder and she's like, what are you doing? He just got a hip surgery and I'm like I gotta change this light bulb. I would think that one good benefit

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       about weightlifting with the increase in bone density and that he would want that if you have artificial hips especially cause you got that bar that goes down deep into the bone. The hips got a Dexa scan done. Weird shit going on. We got really weird shit going on. We had a Dexa scan done and Dr. Jacob Wilson told us that our Boleyn, was it bone mineral density density density. Yeah, it was mine. Mine was like off the charts, but his was way off the charts. And then we also got a biopsy done by a Dr Andy Galpin and he's just like, dude, I love that guy. He's like, I don't the fuck's going on with your, with my muscle and his muscle. He's like, but we need to talk about this morning. So it's called steroids. Yeah, I know. Yeah. So he said he wanted to interview me more in and talk to me more about like what I've taken over the years ago.

Speaker 2:          00:03:46       It was different than works. It works fantastic when people, I just think I heard you talking the other day about throwing a roundhouse kick and he said it's a second nature to you. And I think for us, we've been lifting for so long, a lot of this stuff, even when I was a drug addict and alcoholic the entire time, I still trained every day. I wasn't doing as good of a job, but I still would make it to the gym everyday. It's ingrained in us. It's something that we've been doing forever. So I think the body is just designed for it. It's essentially designed for, not design, but you've sort of designed it and I think it's something that found us, you know, like, like we did kind of stumble upon it but I think it's something that found us and it's uh, you know, I was strong right out of the gate.

Speaker 2:          00:04:24       He was strong right out of the gate. I mean I remember, uh, my friend's benching in the garage and they were benching the bar, maybe a 10 on each side and I was, you know, doing a plate, doing one 85, 12 years old, you know, he was an animal when he was younger. It's just something there, there some sort of strength. My Mom, our mom bench, what she meant to be fine. Yeah, she'd been mom can bench one 35 like right off, you know, like without ever lifting. I want to say, I think she benched one 85 she might've in the same day cause she ideas would say immigrant mentality because your mother from, where's she from? She's a Polish right? You Go, I just got some of my heart thought. I'm just, I'm just white mix getting 23 and me done. I got one of those things done and I, yeah, I'm like Irish and I'm like only 4% of the, and I thought we were more, but it makes kind of sense.

Speaker 2:          00:05:13       Our grandmother was directly from Sicily, so I don't, I don't understand how that happened. Yeah. We don't know what's going on. Yeah. Well even if she's from Sicily, who knows? Like how, what happened? She was over there. She came from, yeah. Yeah. I know. I need to get mine done. I've been wanting to get it done for awhile. It's pretty cool. Someone a lot to tell you like allergies, they get mad. People get mad. The people will not really native American. They get rid of, they get mad. I think it was spiritual. People were like, I could drink so much because I'm Irish. And then they find out they're not. Yeah, you're just a drug like that. And it happens all the time. People get really upset because they're not what they've been rooting for. The alliance. People take great pride in that for some reasons that you were so dumb. Yeah. Where you're from. Who Cares? I'm American control over that. Yeah. I, I wish I was something stupid, but there is, I mean it not like one.

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       Yeah, Polish is a silly one, but in my mind they're fucking hard people. I've known a lot of Polish people and like dare fucking tough people. Like you want to Nj check. That's a perfect example. Some of the fighters Polidori Geraldine and Kovach. Kovich that's that a beast. Nope. No, that woman I should say. Yeah, those, those ladies are fucking tough. Like when I was a kid watching pro wrestling, Ivan put ski the whole fucking Jack. He was, now he works at a Strip club in Vegas. Does he still alive Polish power? Like to go to that Strip club to shake that guy. But I know that um, a bunch of the wrestlers worked at Cheetahs. I know the Godfather, the wrestler, the Godfather, he still manages Cheetahs I guess. And I think some of these real quick and real life, he's a real pantsuit. I was watching some clips from last night from wrestlemania and Ronda Rousey was with Kurt Angle and I was looking at Kurt Angle's body.

Speaker 3:          00:06:53       I was like wow, that guy's gone through some damage damage. Lots of neck surgeries. Well you could see it in his arms. The neck surgeries you see in guy's arms cause their arms atrophy. Right. He's at your feet a lot. Yeah cause it's fucking neck. Looks like a goddamn treat. Trump, he's just got this neck that starts above his ears. His arms are not nearly as to say as it used to be. I think it's nerve damage. Right? Exactly. Yeah. I had Pat Miletich in here a couple of weeks ago, you know former UFC champion pat and he's got one arm that's smaller than the other one boss route and to be here tomorrow, he's got the same issue. Savage next neck issues for what you know. And I had a bulging disc in my neck and I was getting weird, a numbness in my hands and then nerve pain in my elbow, elbow, the Ulnar nerve.

Speaker 3:          00:07:38       It goes on there and when you ignore that shit and then keep training and keep getting your fucking neck yanked on, then the disc starts to decay. And then the pressing against the, the the nerves and the, um, the, the, the spinal column, it gets worse and then it starts atrophying and cutting off the, the nerves to your arms and you get to the point where you're, you're shit just shrinks and it doesn't come back. A lot of that stuff happens in your sleep to like, something gets aggravated from training, but you sleep. Where'd you sleep with your neck? All twisted. You know, that happened to Brian Shaw, but Brian Shaws 415 pounds. But he said he wished he had a good story for why his arm was atrophying, but it was a, he lost his grip strength 100%. He's the world's strongest, strongest man. Yeah. 14 lost his grip strength and it was mainly all through sleep.

Speaker 3:          00:08:21       Got To sleep apnea, study done, and then he got a see CPAP, the c to help actually cured everything. He tried to do any and everything. He was doing all kinds of different things to get his hand strength back and it turned out his mainly asleep. He's too big to sleep on his side. Whoa, that's crazy. So how's you have to sleep face forward? I think he has to sleep on his back. I should get one of them. Massage tables, just sleep at his whole, it was facing the wall. I want to do that. You fall asleep on those things all the time and that's the only way to keep from snoring is the thing with me. I have a fat tongue and if I lie down on my back, my tongue, I have sleep apnea too, but I wear a mouthpiece. I

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       don't the of how some of these people taping their mouth shit. Yeah, you could do that where a chin strap and you can breathe through your nose. It'll help. Yeah. Because if you breathe through your mouth and your tongue falls back and it came out of my mouth for improper, you're not breathing properly would wake up with headaches. I would just wake up tired and with headaches. And then, um, I went to this guy, doctor [inaudible], he's in Encino and he has this mouthpiece that is essentially, it's a mouthpiece with like a tongue. It presses down like a tongue depressor presses down in your tongue and it keeps your tongue from falling backward. It was a fucking game changer for me. Shit, I tried to tap, just changed. Yeah. I tried to see pat for one night. I might get this fucking good robot bullshit machine out of my face and mark didn't like it.

Speaker 2:          00:09:37       He got scared and I, yeah, I'm claustrophobic. So it scared the fuck out of me. Really? Yeah. I hated that shit on my face and I tried the [inaudible] the nose one. I tried the mouth when I can do either one of them mouthpiece really, really bad and um, it's cleared up a lot by just losing weight, but I think and less fat. That's a big thing. Yeah, that's a factor. That's a factor for a lot of people. The fat and their neck and everything. Just sort of, I mean I was again and got so big, he can't actually fatter. So I mean I, I could see why that's a thing with weightlifters. You know, interesting thing. You get so big that you can't sleep. You still some shit on your shirt. You spilled some coffee there. That's the worst. Trying to wipe it up from getting a stained.

Speaker 2:          00:10:18       So, um, tell me about this carnivore diet. Cause I had Sean Baker in here and he talked to me about it, but he doesn't have any science, you know, there's no like he doesn't have any like real tests or any longterm studies or anything like that. And you know, I, I'm a person who believes in balance and I think that you need fido nutrients. You need plant fiber. I think there's a lot of healthy stuff that you'd get from plants. Um, I'm a big believer in eating meat though, but all meet you guys doing all me. Yeah, I think there's modified it and think there's some one at a time. But yeah, I think there's some, I think there's some holes in every diet. I think when you go and you make the decision to only eat meat, then some rational thought should come into your head.

Speaker 2:          00:11:02       Maybe when I switch all the way to just meet all the time, maybe there's a possibility I'm going to eat too much meat. And so maybe that would make sense to bring in some fruit and bring in some vegetables just so you're not eating too much meat for the simple reason. Vegetables have been shown and, and there's, you know, you can get a study to show you anything. Uh, but there's study a study that's been done on 200,000 people that went on for 14 years and they studied, uh, vegetables. They study every type of vegetable and they found that they were more neutral than they were harmful or good for you. They found that fruit was a little bit better for you. And again, you can have any studies say, wait a minute, what does this study? It's called the pure study. Wait a minute. They said it's the vegetables or neutral. What does that mean? They're neutral. They're just really help you that much. They weren't necessarily great and they weren't necessarily bad. I don't know what the Harrison to what though. I don't know what their standard was for what they were looking for exactly. But main thing they were looking

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       for was uh, it being protective in terms of your heart. That was their main, they're the main thing they were looking at. And so they found out that saturated fat is protective of your heart. They found out that cholesterol is actually protective of your heart. It found out that salt is pr now it's all like, you know, without, you can't take in tons and tons of salt because then something's gonna kill you. If you eat a pound of salt, you're dead, you know, assaults, one of those things. It's really good for you. It's an essential mineral to a certain extent, but have to take too much of it. So I think any of these things can be done too far. I jumped on a carnivore diet just to give it a shot and to see exactly what it was about. Because you talked to Sean, Sean Baker. Yeah, he was.

Speaker 1:          00:12:31       He was on your podcast. I got inspired to do it. He was already doing it. So I was like, all right, let me try it out. I tried it out and got leaner. It felt better and I was like, this is pretty cool. And why did you start it? So I was doing a ketogenic diet for over a year and lost a lot of weight on that was doing great. Feeling really good man. You look very healthy. I appreciate it. I still have a long way to go. In my opinion. This is a work in progress, but um, the reason I did it was really simple. It's a dietary intervention. Um, I went through sobriety as you know, I was a drug addict and an alcoholic for about six years and when I went through sobriety, that's a, that's an intervention. Like they, there's something wrong, there's a problem, we need to fix it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:13       So my problem now was arthritis and I needed something that was like an intervention that would get me from, you know, uh, being arthritic and in pain and not being able to lift to being able to lift. And so there's some of this might be a placebo effect of me going like, well, I'm on this diet and I feel great and whatever. And so I'm, I'm now lifting more. Um, some of it may be a placebo effect and that's okay with me if it is, but I feel excellent on this diet and I think the reason is, is I'm getting a lot more protein in. I wasn't getting enough protein on Kido because I was listening to everybody say, well, it will knock you out of ketosis if you eat too much protein. And that's what I constantly was being told. But I wasn't muscular.

Speaker 1:          00:13:53       I didn't have, I wasn't being able to put on muscle. Well, you, you were constantly testing your blood levels. Were you using a meter? Yeah, every day. About three or four times. Like I'm crazy with it because ptosis, the things that would knock me out of Ketosis, we're just like mainly anything with carbohydrates. Um, I wasn't really having too much of a problem with protein because I wasn't eating a lot of protein. But, um, there was, there were things that if I cheated on my diet for example, of course that would, you know, he usually kicked me out of ketosis. But then I also got to a point where you become so fat adapted that you become what we like to call metabolically flexible. Metabolic flexibility just means you can switch from being a fat burner. You know, I'm mostly a fat burner for the most part because I'm eating high fat.

Speaker 1:          00:14:37       But then if I do eat something with sugar in it, it doesn't really affect me that much because I, because I'm used to it 90%. Yeah. Going with the fat so I can kind of move back and forth between those two things. But what I realized on the Diet when I switched over to carnivore the whole time, I was thinking, man, if I could just have an apple, I would feel like I would feel so much better cause just eating the steak, it's killing me and it's driving me crazy. It was a killing just mentally I wasn't ready for it. I wasn't tough enough to just say, okay, I'll just have steak on a plate. Well you automatically use intermittent fasting almost cause you're like, you don't always have a hamburger in your pocket or you don't always a run through in and out Burger, whoever it might be.

Speaker 1:          00:15:18       But yeah, you end up utilizing some intermittent fasting and you're like, fuck man, the only food I have to eat as a hamburger or a steak and it was hamburger or a steak. And I'm like, well how about an apple? So I talked to our friend Stan efforting who's a bodybuilder and he's huge. He jacked and he's also a power lifter and soup. The one years old, two and fucking Jack Soup. But one of the smartest guys I know. And he sent me that study that I sent to you with the, about the fruit, and I don't know if you watched that or not, but basically they did a large scale study with fruit and they found out that uh, the fruit actually would drive blood glucose down instead of, instead of bringing it up when taken with protein, like red meat. And so I'm like looking at this going like, well, if it's not going to drive my glucose up, I mean that'd be the one thing I'm concerned with.

Speaker 1:          00:16:04       Why not have some fruit? And so that I'm in talking with Stan about it, he was saying like, I think fruit is totally fine and I think you can have as much as you want. And so I sort of switched over. And it's crazy though because that's, that's sugar. I mean, yeah. Your body. How did you, how was your body glucose level? They've done studies where they've, where they've studied fruit toast. So like everybody thinks fruit toast is really bad, but they think that because of high fructose corn syrup and fructose is really bad when it's outside of fruit. But for some reason, um, fruit, fruit has these phytonutrients that has fiber in it and those things sort of like protecting you from what's going on in the sugar. They actually, there's Fido nutrients in fruit, like say an apple. There's certain phytonutrients in there that won't allow your small intestine and like absorb the fat.

Speaker 1:          00:16:52       And so it actually helps you to digest things like red meat that have high fat. There's fruit that help you digest the sugars in them and not, it's not like it share it out. I'm not a doctor, I'm a filmmaker. So I started, you know, basically, um, ask a lot of questions that were a lot of people and start figuring things out and then it's trial and error. Um, right now I'm in the trial trial and error part and it seems like it's been working pretty good. So No. Are you getting your blood work done? Yes. Um, just got my blood work done, um, from last month and everything improved from Quito to carnivore. I didn't really have any cholesterol issues. Um, I didn't have any, Eh, the, uh, what was, what, what am my issues that we've had our bloodwork done probably four or five times in the last year or so, I would say.

Speaker 1:          00:17:40       Yeah. And uh, you know, not all the numbers are, are fucking great, but for the most part it's been pretty healthy. The cholesterol has been good to triglycerides have been good. Um, this doesn't show up in your blood? Uh, just, it's not in the hot, not in the high range of, you know, of what, what it shows you on the uh, on the sheet. And then we also had other people for what? Uh, oh, in terms of like the triglycerides and the cholesterol and stuff like that. So you're talking about, well, like what you soon, what's not good? No, I'm just saying everything's, everything's been pretty good. Like this last time I did have my, um, uh, I had one of my markers Kinda high, both had high c reactive protein and we don't, we're not sure why. So that's something that we have to like looking at what is c reactive protein?

Speaker 1:          00:18:25       It's a marker for inflammation and my react specifically of the heart. Yeah, not good. And I see this, mine was really high on Kido, but then after I went Keto to carnivores, it came way, way down. So I don't, I don't know where it is right now. And I also had a really hot mine registered really high at a nowhere. It was totally fine with all the blood work I've had done. And the last one I had done, it skyrocketed. People were saying, well, maybe it's because you worked out beforehand or what you consistent in when you ate, when you got your tests done, where are you guys on a fast train beforehand? So I might've fucked it up. Oh, you fucked it up for sure. Yeah, I'm saying it yourself after we, you train, you train like a fuck the blood work. It's, it's, you know, it's a snapshot in time and we hear that a lot and I think that that's important to realize and recognize that um, it's just, you know, this one snapshot in time and we constantly change all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:19:21       So particularly important with dietary cholesterol, with cholesterol in the blood, the way it registers. If you have a big fat filled meal and then go and get a blood test versus you fasting. It's like how was your body absorbing? This is what's really important. How's your body absorbing these essential new nutrients? Not like what, what happens right after you eat because your body knows what to do with that stuff. My cholesterol was one 90, which is good. I mean they want it, they want it to be under 200, but I thought it was really interesting was my hdl went way up from a 60 points when I'm going from Quito to carnivore. Well are you eating a lot of fatty cuts? Like rib eyes, mostly rabbis. I like a lot of dietary fat. I like a lot of like meat fat, you know, I think there's a certain point right because um, I, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:20:10       Before when I was doing the ketogenic diet, the fat is kind of free flowing because a, you make your bulletproof coffees and you just dump it back and everything too. Putting butter on everything. But when you have doing it, yeah. When you have a stake, what's really nice about having a stake is your rate about 65 to 75% fat already? Like just grinding corn after the box. Yeah. You eating corn fed beef? Is that what you're going to be? I eat both. Um, I think that um, the difference between the grass fed and the, and the grain fred, there really isn't a substantial amount of proof of how much better that is. I do know that grass fed beef has five times the amount of Omega three. So

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       you always want to pick grass fed beef when you can, but a lot of people can't afford it. And also, uh, the bet for me, the best meat is at Costco. That's the best tasting meat that you're going to find. I've been everywhere. It's my, why is costco better? It just tastes the best around for the best. They have the best meat and it's called fuck some like expensive butcher shop. It's corn fans. Cosco standing. Costco is all organic now too. You know, that's a weird word though. That word is so loosely defined. Well we didn't spray it with a fucking dad right before we give to, all right. There is a, um, what is exactly organic. You have to pay to get organic status too. That's a weird thing. You know you have to pay a lot of money. Cause I remember talking to the bulletproof and night, the guy was telling me like, you have to uh, to Dave Asprey, he's telling me you have to pay money to get recognized as being organic.

Speaker 3:          00:21:41       So I have some sort of, that guy says, well, the fat. Sure. I know what I'm saying. You have to pay to get it to be a, I wonder if that's true. Yeah. I don't know if that's true. It is true. It doesn't mean I'm sure it costs money to get tested and to make sure that you're certified. Yeah. Inside, something like that. You had to pay money for it. I mean, there, there has to be some sort of regular, I mean, but when you're looking at the standards like that, what does that mean? It means no antibiotics, no added hormones, right? Is that what it means? I believe so. Yeah. Marines, no pesticides. Right? Yeah. I mean, excuse me for plants and vegetables or fruits and plants. Um, w the one thing that concerns me a with grass fed meat is that you're eating what you do.

Speaker 3:          00:22:25       You definitely get a more expensive cut, but you're eating an animal that is eating what it's supposed to eat. Yeah. When you're eating, like I've had weigel beef and colby beef, it's delicious. It's awesome man. That's thing's dead. That's a dying animal. That's like eating a giant fat guy about to have a heart attack. I mean all that marbling that's not supposed to happen. Like you shoot a bison like a free range bison, you get a dark Ruby Red Hong Kong meat. I mean, and that's all I have to say. I completely agree with you. Um, but there, there isn't science to really support that eating a cow that was fed with soy or corn is necessarily way worse. And so, um, I might just be stupid for waiting for that to come out. It could be worse on a second. You just said that there's way more omega fatty acids and grass fed beef, that's omega fatty acids are essential for brain development, muscle development. There's, so there's so many benefits to a sense, those essential fatty acids and if those are more present in grass fed meat, when you just assume that grass fed meat is more nutritious. Yeah, I would, I would say that it has more, it has moral, meg has more Omega three, it might be more nutritious than in that that particular a way that I say like, you know, is the cost benefit. The other day I went and bought, um, grass fed meat from wholefoods 33 99 a pound

Speaker 2:          00:23:45       for a filet, 1999 a pound at Costco for a flay. The Costco one is so much better. The one from whole food was almost not edible. Like it did, didn't, it didn't taste good. It's real tough. Tough fillet a at whole foods. I don't know why they'd have crappy meat for some reason. Grass fed stuff. Sometimes a little text message. You get a sponsorship for Costco right before you go? No, no, no, no nails for suspicion. The ships. But what I'm saying is that, um, I've, I've gone to a lot of places is try to find what me I thought tastes the best. And um, you know, so for me, sometimes I have to like, you have to eat a lot of meat and if it doesn't taste that good, you're not going to get through it. So I prefer to have meat that tastes better.

Speaker 2:          00:24:30       I like 'em for grass fed me, I like to use grass fed beef patties cause they're a little fattier and they, this tastes really, those tastes fine to me. Yeah. But the grass fed steaks just, they don't really taste as good. So I just kind of switched back and forth. I think these are some of the smaller issues. These aren't the main things that we're really trying to fight. You know, my brother and I, we just, uh, took on to do another film and he, you know, he and I are doing this one together on nutrition and we're just, we're trying to find out some truths. I mean we're trying to find out about grass fed and organic and all of these different things. But mainly we're just trying to figure out how the fuck do we help fight obesity? How do we help fight diabetes?

Speaker 2:          00:25:08       How do we help people gain control of their diet? And I think that's really truly we're talking about is control and you look at it something like a ketogenetic diet, in my opinion, it's one of the few diets that can really help people with control of their diet because it can help break up the cravings. And that's really ultimately I think where our fight is against. It's against cravings while these convenient foods that tastes so fucking good, while the credit thing space all the time, fine carbohydrates and sugars a little, those are giant. And when, excuse me, when you hear about saturated fat being dangerous, it is dangerous if you take saturated fat with high levels of carbohydrates and high levels of refined sugars, right? Doctor Rhonda Patrick went over that in depth and it's really fascinating the reaction that your body has to the high levels of carbohydrates in the high levels of fat.

Speaker 2:          00:25:53       So your body is either fat burning or carbohydrate burning. So when you combine the two of them together, you have a nightmare disaster, but it's not the saturated fat that's the problem. It's a saturated fat in conjunction with the refined carbohydrates and sugars. And one of the things that they're finding too is one of the big arguments that vegans in particular have used for high carbohydrate diets in, in, in relation to obesity, is look at Asian cultures and Asian cultures. You have low levels of obesity, but high levels of high carbohydrates. But you know what else? You have high levels of diabetes. You don't have to fat to be diabetic. How many people in China? 400 million people with diabetes there break a record. Their level slightly lower than ours. Um, in terms of diabetes, but level

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       is higher than, it's pretty high, right? Yeah. Japan's level of diabetes per capita is higher than ours. Their body crazy levels are probably pretty high too. No, no. Their body fat levels are lower than ours. We're gross. Oh, of course. They're looking at you and I, and not the three of us were not gross, but Americans were fucking gross. Yeah. You know, we fucking dog shit and we eat and look and speaking of dogs, so we feed our dogs only to like species on the planet that get fat are human beings and the things that we feed, oh my friend's cat is a cat. It could be a dog but it's our pets and people get fat ice cream. You know we grew up like that. We grew up eating oreo cookies, having you know, a plethora of ice creams and different things and the inner cabinets or the gym and do you know, full on squat workout, you know, work up to 500 pounds and go home and eat like you know, half a gallon ice cream.

Speaker 3:          00:27:35       Just cause we didn't know any better. It's not even true. It wasn't a full workout. It was just a squat as heavy as we could. Then we went home and you know, but there's some benefit for eating some sugar post workout. Right? Yeah. I know Jim still penny he believes in that. Like he's into like gummy bears and shit. Like that is a big shift though in what's going on in nutrition and what people think about that co that postworkout carb window and all that kind of thing. I think a lot of people have been shifting away from that kind of stuff. A lot of people have been shifting away from six meals a day. A lot of them people been shifting away from fasted cardio and a lot of these dietary like sort of myths that we thought that we needed to do. We're looking into it and going like, wait, if you don't eat after you work out, you don't lose muscle, you don't do that.

Speaker 3:          00:28:16       You know, these things don't happen. So do you need to do that? Like it could be beneficial or it could not be, but we're starting to realize that, you know, maybe some of these things that we were doing aren't necessary. I think there's science behind it too because there's money to be made, so I don't think it really matters exactly when you take in your carbs. I think if you were just to have carbs throughout the day, I think you would end up with a similar pump and you'd end up with similar recovery levels. I know there's a lot of studies showing that, but there's probably not a study showing a, if you took in 300 grams of carbs just normally versus dumping some more in after workout. Well you guys know Rob Wolf, right? Absolutely. He's awesome. He's great. But one of the things that Rob Wolf has done is pretty interesting as he and his wife will eat the exact same thing and then an hour later they tend to the coast and they have very different results.

Speaker 3:          00:28:58       And this is something that's really important to emphasize. Everybody's body is different. And some people just like, I have one daughter that can't, she's lactose intolerant. She, she drinks milk, she starts farting, which is seven years old. She thinks it's hilarious. She thinks it's Hilarious, but it does hurt her stomach a little bit and you know, but she'll have like a little ice cream and it's just start farden and she does it on q two. She goes, there's something really important to tell you how she nails you. She knows like she'd been hanging out with you guys to hanging out with Quinn. That's his jokes. But my other daughter and my nine year old, a zero problem with, so it's, um, it is, it's just a physiological thing and it's a weird roll. The dice. I mean, human beings, we've very an color. We vary in height, we very, in everything we've, we definitely

Speaker 2:          00:29:41       very in our dietary needs. And that's what makes, it's so crazy to try to give people a, any sort of nutritional advice because, you know, you can't talk in generalizations. He can't say this will work for everybody. I can't get on here and say an all meat diet. I think you can, we'll work for everybody. And in some way, I think most people are eating too much sugar. People that are fat and a carb period. Well, that's, that's what we're trying to define by doing a documentary. What are the couple things that we can point to and say, everybody needs to do this, this and this. And then these other things are like, I just wonder if the average American only 800 carbs every day, if people wouldn't be fat, you know, it makes me scratch my hydrate requirements for athletes though. Oh, like, yeah, like my friend Cam Haynes who runs like when he's training for these ultra marathons, he runs a fucking marathon a day.

Speaker 2:          00:30:28       That guy needs more carbs than the average guy who sits in front of his desk in his, on a can. Here's where carbon, I may be really more fat. You know, like they may be you only, you can only store, um, 2000 calories of carbohydrate in your body at one time. But the normal average person has about 40,000 calories of fat just hanging out on their body and they don't even know it, right? So we have a lot more energy available to us as, as fat. If we learn how to utilize carbs are also crucial from one workout to the next. So if you're anybody that ever does multiple workouts in a day of any of these MMA fighters, crossfitters, they're doing multiple, they absolutely need carbs and it's a good opportunity like forget the car window necessarily. It's just another opportunity to eat and to get in some calories.

Speaker 2:          00:31:12       And so I think for them, post workout shakes and those carb shakes could be really beneficial. It's a problem with athletes too because they're always trying to find the optimum performance and you're experimenting and you're wondering how much of your mind fucking yourself, how much of it is just because you worked out too hard? Like where's your energy level at? It's that you didn't sleep good. Is that your diet? Like what is it? You know, and they're always trying to figure it out. It's a big commitment and a big deal to actually stop what you're doing and, and to eat because it takes you like 2030 minutes to actually eat. Might take a 10 20 minutes to cook the meal and then you have 2030 minutes to try to digest it. And you're not sure if you're doing mma, you have intense workouts or if you're doing crossfit or some of these workouts can be really intense.

Speaker 2:          00:31:54       You're not sure how that's going to sit. So sometimes for me, I'm just like, fuck it, I'm just going to use intermittent fasting, but I don't compete anymore. So for me it doesn't matter as much. Well, intermittent fasting, it's absolutely beneficial. And I think one of the things that we've talking about, one of the benefits of the Keto Diet that you also get from intermittent fasting is when your body goes into fat burning mode, you're, your hunger goes away. It's the weirdest thing. That's an important thing to kill. I had a really poor relationship with food before I even started the Ketogenic Diet. And by, by doing women too, let's not talk over each other. I know it's hard and we're all doing it, but let's try. Gotcha. And so, but yeah, not being hungry has allowed me to have a little bit, uh, you know, I feel free now. I feel like I'm not, you know, attached food. I don't need

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       food all the time. I used to think about food all the time because I was constantly, you know, eating things with sugar in it. I used to go to the movies and cause I'm a filmmaker, I love to go to the movies and I used to go all the time and I had this rule where during the movie was my only time I could cheat on my diet and I could eat whatever I wanted and it turned into a cluster fuck because I, I'd have, you know, I'd have like the little pretzel bites with the cheese that you'd did ben have sour patch kids and twizzlers and I'd buy three bags of candy and pretzels and I'd eat the whole thing during the movie because the movie's usually suck. And I need something to do to keep my mind off of the shitty movie. So I would eat the whole time, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:33:15       And obviously that didn't work, you know, and I was doing, I was dieting besides that, but you know, it wasn't doing anything because I was killing all the, you know, all the progress I was making. But by doing this Keto genic diet and not being hungry, it's allowed me to just sit back and look at food and go, I want that. And I want that because it's good for me rather than say I need this now because I'm hungry. Do you still do cheat meals? No. Well, once in awhile I shouldn't say no because then somebody will catch me on instagram with a piece of cake and be like, that guy's a liar. But the thing is I don't, I try not to, but there's things that that are cheating for the carnivore diet that sometimes like come into my life. Like somebody makes a new bar and they give it to me and they're like, oh, here, try this bar.

Speaker 1:          00:34:02       And I want to just try it to see if it's good. So yeah, it's off my diet and I'll eat it. But my cheats are much less damaging than they used to be. My cheats now are what some people call health foods now. When you say carnivores, you t you saying that all of your meals or just meat? Yeah, they're just, yeah, just meet just a steak usually or um, grass fed beef salads, no salads for the most part. Uh, every once in a while, like if I'm at a restaurant or something and a salad creeps in, I'll have a couple bites of it. But, um, I'm not a vegetable kind of guy. I've never really liked them. But I do love fruit. I like the sweet stuff, but I don't like the vegetables that much. So how much fruit to you to do now?

Speaker 1:          00:34:41       About two to three pieces of fruit a day. Um, like an apple, like maybe two apples a day, probably something like that. And then how many meals and maybe be one. And then about two meals a day. Like two, maybe like two stakes or you know, maybe for Burger patties or something like that. So it's not a whole lot of food that I'm talking about. I can't eat like Dr. Sean Baker. He's an animal. Eats about four pounds of meat a day. He's a big giant dude. But yeah, he's six, five. He's a foot taller than I am, so that's pretty crazy right there. So yeah, there's not a whole lot of food. I think a lot of people want to hear all meet. They're just thinking, um, downing these giant plates of food. But I'm not that hungry. So I try, I do have to try to hit my protein goal each day though, which is about, you know, I need a certain amount of protein, so I need like 168 grams of protein or something like that. I went off the rails the other night at a Peter Luger's in Brooklyn. I saw that and we were, we were so excited. Ooh. So good. But we were eating steak and then I was stuffed from the

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       steak, but French fries were there. And it's a weird thing, man. When you eat steak and there's fries, you could be stuffed from the steak, but you fucking keep pounding those fries. Those salty fries are still God damn good. Palate fatigue is a big thing. And that's what a professional eaters do. They go from like, they'll be eating ice cream and I can't eat anymore. So they eat some French fries because it's a different taste salt. There's something about the side food with salt. You could just stuff more in there. If you look at like Brian Shaw, the world's strongest man that we were talking about before, he uses a dextrose. He takes like puts it on rice, which is just sugar and he puts it on rice so that you can eat more rice. Jesus. Yeah. Just so he'd get bigger so you can get bigger.

Speaker 2:          00:36:19       Yeah. So you can maintain it, maintain his, uh, his felt 440 pound body. That's fucking, well, that's a totally different thing. One thing that we, one thing that we've tried to do is we've tried to not celebrate, you know, I think that can be an issue. It's like you do want to celebrate here and there. You want to have some fun here and there, but have control over that celebration. Like you're celebrating, you know, you're, you're a buddy's birthday party that you never even talked to and you're getting drunk and eating fucking cheesecake and stuff. Celebrate when you really want to celebrate, when you really kind of quote unquote need to, uh, maybe you celebrate after you lost 20 pounds. But if you celebrate, uh, by cheating on your diet, uh, it's actually like more harmful to you than it is a real celebration. You're hurting yourself rather than helping improve yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:37:07       Now we do need to be, uh, we do need times where we do have fun and we kick back and have a couple of drinks, but drinking or overeating, a lot of those things, even when you're trying to stay on your diet, they will almost always lead to cheating. I noticed that when, if I overeat, that's, that's, uh, when I get hit with a craving sometimes, so somebody might think, oh, I'm just going to stuff myself with a bunch of burgers. I'm gonna stuff myself with a bunch of meat. Um, it, for me, it hasn't worked that way. It kind of makes those cravings creep back in. Yeah, for sure. I mean, but it's also psychologically it's fun. Cheat. Absolutely. Give yourself a little bit of a break at some linguine with clams. I'd say even like on a, on a, on a carnivore diet, there's some things that I eat.

Speaker 2:          00:37:48       I consider them like slight cheats, like going to in and out burger, you know, getting like a flying Dutchman, you know, that is no flying Dutchman is uh, uh, patty and then two pieces of cheese and on a patty that's cheating. Well it's the cheese because of the cheese. Yeah. And, and it's, it's not grass fed or anything like that. So you're like, no. So they have, who knows? Well what I'm eating, but at least it sort of fits on my, my plan. But those are so good that every once in a while, you know, he stopped it in and out and get a couple, I'd get it with the lettuce on. Um, they give you way too much lettuce. I think that they can be like an entire head of lettuce. And I'm like, how do I get through this? You don't like let us, no, not really.

Speaker 2:          00:38:24       Not a big fan. And neither one of us love salad. I S I said on instagram the other day that a salad is fake news and people got really pissed. But what I meant by that was just that people are dumping tons of dressing on it. Oh yeah. And they're not getting in and getting what they think they're getting. And especially like a lot of salads that you get at like a restaurant or just a, they're not even very green or anything that just got full of very teachers. A couple dressings like mark sisson makes a dressing that's, that's pretty good. Made with avocado oil, I think. Things like that. And He, and he says, I made this dressing because I wanted to be able to dump as much as I want on the here. And the more I'd dump on the healthier it gets. And I liked that idea because I eat a lot of wild game.

Speaker 2:          00:39:03       Wild game doesn't have much fat at all. Like if I talked about that chipolte lay mayonnaise and I started eating like crazy after you said it, I had a ton of it this morning with a steak. That's really good. I'll slice of pizza, steak, Dunkin and put a fucking Glob of mayonnaise on my plate. I'll dunk the stake in the mail, but it's a chipolte lay lime mayo and it's made with avocado oil, so you're getting all these healthy fats. It gives you some nice taste, and again, because I'm eating moose and elk and deer, it was a very, very lean meats. If I'm not eating like a cow, if not even eating beef, my meat is mostly really wouldn't be able to do a carnivore diet on those kinds of meats. Right. I mean it's too, it's too lean, right? Yeah, I would think so. You'd have to add fat, other rabbit starvation.

Speaker 2:          00:39:49       Yeah. Rabbits are extremely lean and you can eat only rabbit and literally starve to death. Wow. Yeah. People have experienced rabbit starvation. She sounds crazy. It is crazy because it's so lean. Google that Google rabbit starvation, what that means, because someone told me about that and I literally never looked into it other than what they said, but it's so lean that yeah, your body just doesn't get enough fat to, butchers typically add fat to a wild game, like when they chop it up and stuff. Not Protein poisoning. Protein poisoning. Also reserve for it as a rabbit starvation, a rare form of acute malnutrition thought to be caused by a complete absence of fat, the Diet. Oh, that's interesting. They call it protein poisoning and rolling. Yeah, so because if you just eat rabbits, like if you just have like a fucking room full rabbit, rabbit, rabbit me.

Speaker 2:          00:40:38       But most people would eat rabbits, eat my rabbits with potatoes and you look at that rabbit starvation man cannot live by rabbits alone. The meat is too lean. Add fats in a few carbs or protein to the lap end. I guess that's what a rabbit is. And you can easily survive rabbit meat. Lapin is typically to lean. Yeah. It's interesting. Leaner than chicken, I guess. Yes. Yeah. Well those little fuckers are just running all the time. Wow. Interesting. How to, on a ketogenic diet, I was up around 200 grams of protein when I first started it. That was just dropping fat like crazy. Just drop me. That's not a ketogenic diet. 200 grams of protein fat. Oh fat is 20 grams of fat and I was dropping, I said protein, 200 grams of fat and I was just dropping fat. Like you know, like crazy. Oh yeah. But then, then it came to a point where it stopped. I think that's what everybody needs to know is a and I on any of these diets, they eventually plateau or stop and then you have to sort of

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       figure out how to get around that roadblock and continue to like lose more weight or do whatever you're trying to do. Well, some people just too much protein knocks you out of ketosis because your body takes too much protein in reverts it to glucose. Right. I think that's a lot. I think it's overstated a lot though. I mean, I think like if you have a couple of grams over, you're not going to be in trouble. But if you're getting 500 grams of protein or something crazy or even like 300 grams of protein, I, you know, after a while you're going to get to too much and you're gonna have that problem. But I feel like for most people, that's not going to be the main issue. You know?

Speaker 2:          00:42:05       For me it's inflammation. Inflammation is, the big difference is when I eat a lot of carbs, if I go off the rails and I'll cheat and have pasta or bread or something like that, I experienced more inflammation. It's appearance, more soreness in my joints. I've, I'm, I'm, you get more fatigued. You get, you know, like tired, you get that insulin crash, you get all those big factors that I don't, I just don't get when I eat clean, when I eat just meat and salad and vegetables and high fat diet and low carb, my body is just way more efficient and just, it feels better. And the big thing that I keep trying to stress to people is you don't need a nap. That fucking afternoon nap, which I just thought it's something you need. All that is is just your body recovering from lunch. FM carbs.

Speaker 2:          00:42:52       Yeah. You're fucking carbs at lunch if you don't have that, the day is much more efficient. I get more done, I have more energy and I was like, when people say how do you do like all these podcasts, two podcasts a day, like no, I eat good, eat good. And it's not hard. It's not hard. Your brain is functioning all day long, but man, if I stopped at noon and had a fucking pizza and then try to do a podcast, I'd be here like going, oh, is this done yet? I need to sleep. They just get tired. Yeah, you get exhausted. We've been doing this diet since the mid ninety's since like 1993 I think it was around the time we kind of started. We've been doing them on and off for a long time and more recently I used it to drop 70 pounds. But I think one of the, one of the things with Kido that I noticed was it almost doesn't really matter that, I mean ketosis all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:43:38       I think the effort to be in Ketosis I think is important, uh, by getting rid of a lot of the carbohydrates that you have the effort to kind of eat a little bit more fat. But what I've noticed is I don't think I need to really go out of my way to eat tons and tons of fat. I don't need to be dumping tons of MCT oil and stuff. I don't need to, uh, I, there's enough fat usually in the stakes that I'm eating. A lot of times I get ribeye. Um, sometimes I eat bacon, a eggs, things like that. I put up on my instagram the other day about seven or eight foods that I thought if you just stuck to these seven or eight foods for a handful of days, you would lose a lot of weight. And the response was amazing. People were writing back and you're like, Holy Shit, man, I had lost 10 pounds and well, a lot of people do lose weight off Quito. There's no doubt about that. But even mark Sisson, who was one that got me into it, mark goes on and off and he thinks that there's some benefit to going on and off. Yeah. I don't think he has to be in Ketosis. Ketogenetic Diet. Yeah. But even when

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       you go off, you're not switching your diet to spaghetti. You know, you're not eating, you know, fucking wonder bread or shit like that. That's love it. If you switched up spaghetti, right. That's your thing. Pasta. Well, I like it. I like it when I cheat, but I don't like the effect on my body for sure. I just liked the taste of it. Like linguine with clams is one of my favorite things to eat, but the way I feel afterwards, it's not my favorite bread and butter. Why is that? So? Why is that so? It's amazing. So good. Well, you know, people are out in county. They don't even know. We always talk about this. Hard roles used to go. Yeah, like a buttered roll in the morning and we grew up in New York, buttered roll with butter. It was the best thing ever. And out here they don't have him.

Speaker 3:          00:45:10       Thank God. I'm actually glad they don't have now you know and I've had that I fucking love sour dough bread with grass fed butter and honey. Oh my God, they had sourdough salad is really good. What honey? On top of the butter. Oh, oh all this keto genic sounds amazing. When all this stuff going on. I had been wondering when somebody is going to make some bread, like figuring out a terrible though it's not that bad. No foods is good. I like their bread. I make egg sandwiches, no fruits. I haven't tried out w I haven't tried to make a lot of good stuff. I know they just came out the waffles that good, that donuts and stuff like that, but I think a lot of those things for me, they have way too many carbohydrates for me. Way Too many. But I think isn't there something about the type of carbs they have fibers in them?

Speaker 3:          00:45:55       Usually they don't raise your blood level bludge something like that. Yeah. Well I, you know, I don't want to eat regular waffles on a regular basis, but if I'm going to cheat and I eat what they have, you know, and they also have a very low sugar syrup to it tastes very good with some butter. It's just, it's the best option if you're going to do something like that. Exactly. You should mostly eat real foods. Like I feel better when I eat meat and vegetables. That's when I've, when I'm, you know, I had Jordan Peterson on and he had some pretty serious autoimmune disorders and his body was really in trouble and his daughter had similar problems and his daughter went to essentially a diet of just meat and Greens and now I think she's not a carnivore diet and she's got a instagram page to documenting it.

Speaker 3:          00:46:44       But he went to meet and Greens lost a shit ton of weight. Let was losing, I think he said he's losing, what did he say? Like seven pounds a month for something like something along those lines. Lots of ton of weight and looks great. He said he's thinner than he's been at 25 years. It feels great. All is autoimmune issues. We're done. I think a lot of what people are dealing with is inflammation that's caused by too much processed carbohydrates, too much simple refined carbohydrates and sugars and the inflammation leads to disease. So if you look at what they call the five scourges of health, they are a obesity, cancer, cognitive decline, heart disease and diabetes. Those are all metabolic. Those are all things that we get through food and over half the people that are in the hospital today, right now

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       in the United States are in there for metabolic issues. So that's crazy. It's crazy. Most of the, so more than half of the people that are in the hospital are there because of what they ate. It is crazy. And then you see a direct correlation between the amount of refined sugars and carbohydrates. Human beings have adjusted and started eating to the rise in diabetes and heart disease and all these other issues. And you know the, one of the things we were talking about before the podcast is, sorry, I went running today. If for some reason I can't stop coughing, people are dealing with a lot of various health issues and they're always trying to pin like one cause of these health issues. And one of the real problems is when people develop these ideological answers, like veganism is one of them. They do not want to thank that there's anything healthy about meat and that what they do is the only way, and this is the way, and like I'm watching this, there's a thread right now going on on twitter between some cockamamie Vegan doctor.

Speaker 4:          00:48:29       He's full of Shit and all these people that are s citing science and and he is getting pissed off and he's showing his degree and photos of his degree. They're like, look motherfucker, this is real science to the fact that dietary cholesterol is necessary. It's the building blocks for cells. I mean it literally is. It's the, the, it's the reason why your body is converting it to, to all the sex hormones, cholesterol, saturated fat, your body processes that it's healthy for your brain. It's healthy for your heart. All these things are a fact. He's not recognizing the fact that their issue is not saturated fat. It's saturated fat in conjunction with all these other things. And that's a problem with these studies. Like one of the studies they did recently where they showed that people who ate meat more than five times a week, we're much more likely to have heart disease.

Speaker 4:          00:49:19       But that's not a good study because they didn't say, what are they eating the meat with? What are you eating? Are you eating it with Brett? Are you eating it in a, in a, in the same as a burger? Are you drinking a soda with it? Right? Like this is not a good study. A good study would be have someone you know, get a large group of people, put them on a carnivore diet, have a large group of people put 'em on a Keto Diet, have a large group of people, put it on a standard American diet. Let 'em eat burgers and fries and chocolate shakes and sodas and let's, let's, let's find out what the fuck it is. Put people on a Vegan Diet. I have had tons of friends, including Sam Harris who was on a Vegan diet and his fucking blood sugar was off the charts. He had to try.

Speaker 4:          00:49:57       It was trying to figure out how to stay healthy. Like he tried, he tried it for a long time, but he felt like shit. And then he went and switched to fish and he felt like shit just doing that too. And then he went back to me. Now he's helping to answer the answer always seems to come back to being in the middle somewhere, right? Like somewhere we veer off so far and we're like, oh man, we got to retos and we got cookies and we got all this stuff being thrown at us every single day and it's convenient. And then someone will say, okay, you don't know more carbs and you just go the complete route

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       and you end up with something like a carnivore diet. But I think just if you're just sit there and think about stuff logically, it would make sense to me that you can overdo it on me. Like I think you can overdo it on just about anything. Yeah. I, that's why I lean towards balance and that's why I like vegetables, but I can't talk you guys into that. Yeah, I think your balance is probably a, it's probably ideal, but uh, you know, the balance of the average American's not great because I think they think they can just grab and reach for anything. That's their level of balance. Well, I think the average American is just trying to feed themselves. You know what, I'm just trying to, they're hungry and they're tired. And look, there's a great top, uh, Henry thoreau quote that most men live lives of quiet desperation.

Speaker 2:          00:51:08       And I think that applies to so many different things. And one of them is work. Most people are fucking working all day and they're sad and they feel like shit. And when you get out of there, you're like, fucking Wendy's drive through. Come on baby. Hit me up with one of them fucking double cheeseburgers. Chocolate shake, please. Woo. They get a little reward and you know, and then they feel even more shitty and then they crash and they get up and they do it all over again with a fucking egg mcmuffin and a cup of coffee with three scoops of sugar in it. And this is the, this is the rollercoaster that most people are on. And it all started with them going to bed too late because they stayed around and fuck around on their phone or watch TV. I went to bed too late.

Speaker 2:          00:51:45       They woke up later than they wanted. They're tired because they didn't get to sleep. They were supposed to get drank the coffee. Right. And it's just, it's this one thing snowballing after another. Now what are you guys doing in this documentary? Like what are you trying to document? We're basically just going around interviewing people that are sort of in the know, you know, that are writing these books like Mark Sisson, Robb Wolf, those are some of the people that we interviewed. And just asking them, you know, basic questions about diet and nutrition and sort of seeing what, uh, where they stand. And then, um, we're, we SORTA, we shot about 15 interviews right now and then it's my job to sort of figure out like, well how does this all correlate together? You know, so we, we don't really have, I'd say it'd be disingenuous for me to come on and say, this is exactly what we're going to do because I have no idea what it's going to be.

Speaker 2:          00:52:32       And I think that's the beauty of it. When we shot bigger, stronger, faster, I had no clue how that was going to turn out. And I think a lot of documentary filmmakers, they'd go in with like, here's the point I'm going to prove, right, let me find all the people and string them along and then figuring out how they fit into the puzzle. And if they don't conveniently fit in on my puzzle, they're out. And I just, I don't know, I, I developed a different way of doing it. I just like to try to get as much information as I can and then think about it a lot and then put it in a way that makes sense to me. So you're basically doing the opposite of a lot of these propaganda films. Like this is one of the problems that, and a lot of people that have had heart disease or all these various issues, they paid attention to some of these propaganda films. So there's a couple of Vegan ones that are out there right now. What the health that's been widely dismissed by scientists and the integration experts. And I would love to interview him or any of the doctors

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       that are involved in that because you know, why not let them see it, let them, let them speak their mind and let's hear what they have to say and then let's talk about it. You know? And I think that's, that's another interesting thing because the other thing I also feel is like the guy that made what? The health, I just feel like he has good intentions also. Yes. Right. I mean he's not trying to like kill people, kill people. He's trying to help people just like, I'm trying to help people. So he's over here going like this guy is trying to help people eat and meet. He's crazy. The problem is I'm not doing that to him. I think like there is a lot of benefits to a Vegan Diet. There are a lot of people that could benefit from it. Can everybody benefit from it? I don't know. There's a lot of things missing also. So I, I definitely questioned it, but I don't shit all over it. I don't think that's the way to help people that way to help people as a sort of bring them together and figure out what

Speaker 4:          00:54:18       rare that people do it. Right. And I think if you do it right and you have, uh, you know, some sort of b12 12 supplements, whether it is a, you know, from, um, like, uh, Greens, like, um, what do they use a, the, what's that algae, Maria? The algae stuff. There's dominic d'agostino uses right now. There's a lot of that stuff that you can, you can get your b vitamins from and, and if they're not opposed, I mean the, well, some of the simplest organisms on the planet are mollusks, you know, and I know that people think of them as animal life, but they're more primitive than plants. I mean there's, there's certain clams and Molec seen things like they don't, they don't feel fucking shit. They're not suffering. They literally don't have the capacity for pain. And they're one of the more primitive life forms on earth.

Speaker 4:          00:55:03       I mean, we deviated from them 600 million years ago or something like that, but they're barely an animal. We can call them an animal. There are some. But see what we say is because they move, you know, because the clam closes its mouth. We've decided that that's a living thing. It's move to, I mean, do you have to plant that aids the rats? Yeah. That, that thing's awesome. Or Venus fly traps. Yes. And the thing is, plants are far more complex and their ability to communicate and their ability to even express predation, pain and protect themselves through various chemical, uh, means to protect themselves from predation. They changed the way they taste to keep from getting eaten. And there's been studies also that you just play the sound of a caterpillar eating leaves next to plants. They recognize that sound and they changed their taste profile, which is just fucked.

Speaker 1:          00:55:50       Great. And those are, those are chemicals like Lectins, things like lectins and stuff that, um, it can be very damaging to people. A lot of people don't know, but if he, you know, cucumbers and tomatoes and stuff like that, you're getting a lot of these lectins that a lot of people are, they have adverse reactions to. So a lot of people be eating, you know, a variety of vegetables in our diet and not understand why they still don't feel good. Uh, they need to look into that. They might have a lectin issue, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:56:15       Yeah. It's, it's entirely possible. So a lot of people, let me start it. This film, you know, we were going to call it the war on carbs. That's what were, that's what we were talking

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       about. And that's, that's what we've been talking about for quite a long time. But as we started to go through the movie, we were like, Oh, I dunno, war on carbs. Like maybe that's going to isolate. And that's gonna a pigeon holed a movie into one style. But as we started interviewing more and more people, we realized that the problem is carbs. It's a problem, a war on refined carbs and vegetables, oils and sugars, you know, sugar, which is a refined, you say cars. We're talking about pizza, basically an ice cream and all the, all the excess things that people are using. We're not really tough oils, refined carbohydrates, refined sugars, and these are all product to the modern world, modern industrialized world. And they call it production western. They call the uh, diseases, western diseases because they didn't used to have these diseases on that level in other countries.

Speaker 2:          00:57:11       And then when we started exporting molasses and we started exporting rice and everything else, we were exporting to these other countries that didn't have it. They all got sick, they all started getting sick. You know, they all started, their obesity rates went up, their diabetes rates went up. And that's, that's just proof right there that if you eat that stuff, you know, it will have those consequences. Well, one of the, one of the great ways, um, I've seen someone talk about, I forget who it was, it was discussing this. There were saying, look at humans teeth. People did not suffer from the type of tooth decay they suffered from. Now what does that from what's from refined carbohydrates and sugar? That's what it is. And especially sugary drinks, like people were constantly drinking soda. I mean, you are just fucking torturing your teeth. You're just throwing acid on your teeth all day.

Speaker 2:          00:57:54       I can't believe I used to eat all that stuff. When I look back, know man, I used to eat all that and look forward to it too. Right. And I, I guess I thought I felt okay, but I really didn't. You know, I, but I like thinking back on it, I'm like, I feel way better now. But back then I thought I was okay. I thought I was doing a good job. You didn't know any better. I mean, even doing a low carb ketogenic diet, I was still eating a ton of vegetable oil, you know, and stuff like that. And that's just, it was just like I, okay. Chicken wings, they don't have carbs in them, but they're deep fried. Right. It's terrible. So reading that. Yeah, it's, I mean, just stuff like that. I'd say you still have in your diet and not know about.

Speaker 2:          00:58:30       I used to have, um, I was doing a low carb diet, so I figured, okay, I'll make a big salad and I'll dump this dressing all over it and addressing full soybean oil, stuff like that. You know, I'm thinking about it. Yeah. Yeah. So when you set out to do this, what was the motivation just because you're on the health benefits that you found from adjusting your own diet? I think just, yeah, I mean I just like to help people, you know, I like to make films that can help people find their way, find what's good for them or what works for them and um, you know, they can take it or leave it. I think this falls in the category of addiction too because the place that he came from where he was addicted to drugs and alcohol, um, and he was able to overcome a lot of that. I think the Ketogenic Diet, I think without it, I think it would have been a lot harder now. I mean, I think, yeah, I think the ketogenic diet played into it. And I think the reason

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       why, why did it, I did a ketogenic diet in Rehab. So when I got to Rehab, I was like, I'm not eating carbs. Like that's it. So why, why did that help you? Um, it helps with your cognitive function. It helps you to, um, it does, it helps your brain, you know, helps your brain work better habits. And so, um, when I, when I went to Rehab, you know, it was about 245 pounds and I came out at like two 15, uh, from doing a kito diet and I started training again a little bit, but I was still very sick and I was very, like, I was, I was messed up at that time. Like I wasn't right mentally or physically, I was just broken, you know, and I was ready for a change. And so, um, you know, it was, it was very humbling, you know, it's still is actually to even talk about it.

Speaker 1:          01:00:01       So, um, getting knocked down a little bit helped me. Um, it also helped me to start back over and start back over with, uh, with a better head on my shoulders. You know, cause I used to think I knew everything right. And now I think I know nothing. And I think that that's important because I have this white belt mentality now that I use on everything and actually got that from talking to from Fabrizio verdon cause like he was always learning, always thinking I'm always learning. Right. And so I asked him one time, I was talking about Simon, he said, he said, yeah, I'm a white belt mentality towards everything. And I think I've heard you talk about that as well. And um, I think that's important though because we think we know everything. We start preaching all this stuff and then I turned around and go, wow, I really don't know what I'm talking about. A lot of times I really better think about what I say more. And even now I'm just a lot more careful about making absolute statements. I don't make any more absolute statements or things like that because you want to be sure that you're conveying the right information to people.

Speaker 4:          01:00:53       What were you saying before the podcast started? You were, we're going to bring it up again about veganism coming from a religion. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:58       Yeah. Veganism started, um, with the seventh adventist church I believe. So there was, um, uh, you know, a group of people that had a church and the guy that led the church as part of the church was like, you know, they were following the Jewish kosher laws or whatever at first and it was like no pigs or whatever else. Shellfish, I think. Yeah, no pigs or shellfish. And then the guy just said and like it just sort of took it to a next level and said, and like, no, no meat, no animal products at all. And so these people that were in this church where like the first real group of Vegans, a church, I've seventh adventist I think is what it's called, is where it came from. Like 1863 is when that like movement, I guess started it. But like, sure, I'd started early.

Speaker 1:          01:01:41       I'm sure people were doing it earlier than that obviously. But I think that that's where the, the roots came in. And I just find that really interesting because it does, you know, it does seem like a religion. It seems like, um, today it seems like a lot of times you get, um, I get called out a lot on, on instagram and stuff like that from people that are Vegan saying like, I can't believe you'd do this and Bob by, but I would never go on their page and say anything to them at all. Well, so proselytizing,

Speaker 4:          01:02:07       that's a big part of this whole community is it's, there's the moral high ground they stand on it. And then a lot of these people, especially people with Vegan in their name and their screen name, they always go after people and they, you know, they try to shame people and what they're doing is in, uh, in many ways is a very good thing. They're not participating in factory farming. Right. They're not participating in the Harz that we see in these fucking peta videos where you see cows and pigs and chickens are just being tortured. All that fuck, that is disgusting and that should be eliminated and shouldn't be a part of modern culture. But in terms of like the humane raising and killing of animals, look, they're not going to live forever and I don't care what you say. I'm not into animal suffering. I don't think they should suffer, but if you try to say the people are not herbivores or that people are herbivores rather, and then we're not omnivores, you're crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:02:57       It's just not true. It's not fact, and they show picture. These are not the teeth of a carnivore. These are the two that were, we're not carnivores stupid. We're omnivores. A chimpanzee. Yeah, we, we look real similar and our teeth to fucking chimps. Chimps are omnivores and the human diet is a very complex thing. When you attach that human diet to ideology, then it gets really screwy because you're not dealing, you're not dealing with people that are being honest about dietary, like what is really important and as far as dietary requirements, how your body functions, what the studies show, if you look at it objectively, the objective, the first thing anybody should say first thing across the board, Garrett, all the fucking sugar. That's number one. Get rid of all the refined carbohydrates. Eat more vegetables. I think you guys don't eat more vegetables. Eat healthy fats.

Speaker 4:          01:03:48       Get some formal omega fatty acids. Recognize that the omega fatty fatty acids that you get from flax seed oil or not as bioavailable is fact from studies not as bioavailable. Is it mega fatty acids you get from fish and meat, they're just not the meat. The protein. Well, Broccoli has 15 groups. It's not as bioavailable. You fucks and you know it's not. It's just not. So you can get bioavailable protein from plants. You get it from hemp, you get it from [inaudible], you get it from peas. Pea protein is very good, but it's not as good as the, the protein that you get from meat. It's just not, can it sustain you? Yes it can. Can you be a healthy person and live a fucking balanced life on a completely vegetarian diet? 100% but I would always recommend eat free range eggs. You're not hurting a chicken.

Speaker 4:          01:04:37       Nothing gets hurt. It is free food. We have, I have chickens. They roam around, they eat vegetables, nobody eats them. The chickens live a fucking healthy life. They lay eggs, we eat the eggs, the eggs are healthy as fuck ethos. Find a place that has free range. Chickens eat the eggs. It's, I mean it's not Vegan, but it is vegetarian. If you want to get rid of dairy and you don't want, I get it man. I've seen gary dairy farms. It's fucked up. You see what they're doing at cows and they, you know what the way they treat them and the way they're raised them and just the whole idea behind it. Like making them lactate. The only time, but cows. Lactate is when they have a baby, right? So they keep them in this state and it's just, it's unnatural. And that is a reality of dairy production.

Speaker 4:          01:05:19       And if you don't want to be a part of that, that's a hundred percent noble. But we have to be honest about nutrition requirements, not about the ideology of veganism. And this is the problem with these people. And so many of them, especially the ones with Vegan attached to their identity, because they use the name like v I'm, I'm Vegan warrior, this is Vegan prints and the Vegan defender, they're fucking morons who joined a gang. And what they do is they start eating plants, they start talking shit, and they go looking to just go after anybody who's not on the same page as them. And the real problem is people that watch a movie, like what the health or something, and then think, well that this is, oh my God, I'm killing myself by not being a Vegan. Nope, you need to google what the health debunked and find out the actual science because what they're talking about is bullshit.

Speaker 4:          01:06:06       They're not being honest. What they've done is make a Vegan proselytizing movie. They're trying to get people to join in because that's what they do and a lot of these people, but they give up a lot of these people to get to a point where their health can't take it anymore and you fucking give up. Chris Kresser is a perfect example. I don't know, have you interviewed him for a film? Not yet, but we will. He's fucking brilliant. And he was a macro, but he was a macrobiotic Vegan. I mean this guy was all off the charts with veganism and eventually realize his body was falling apart and gave up on it. There's some people that owned that restaurant in California and Hollywood. What is it called? The something cafe. Gratitude. Thank you, Kathy. Gratitude. Yeah. Yeah. These people were, I mean, they're fucking health was falling apart, so they decided to raise their own cattle and ether on meat and vegans found out they got death threats and people were fucking going after them.

Speaker 4:          01:06:55       Yes, ma'am. It was a terrifying thing for these people. They're all our folks and they, they, they have their own farm and they were raising their own farm animals and they decided to start eating them. And when they made these posts about starting these people went after them. Man. You know, it's not, this is not kindness. And you know, this is not someone who's compassionate. He's a fucking cunt, better in a gang and that they're in the plant gang. You know, and if you talk, and I'm sure you've seen it by doing this carnivore diet thing, if you do anything that's outside of that, they go after you.

Speaker 1:          01:07:26       Yeah. Start jumping down throat just so everybody knows you. You keep mentioning, ah, you're not going to talk. I sit in a like in vegetables or whatever. Uh, I, I do eat vegetables. I casually, if you have to find the way, Mike Kenogenic diet before I went on the carnivore diet was mainly a vegetarian diet. Like mostly vegetables. I would eat a lot of vegetables, big salads and all this stuff. And I throw a little bit of meat in because I was very concerned about eating too much protein. So I'd only eat 80 to 100 grams of protein a day. Now I eat double that. And so that's sort of what the switch was and it's just an intervention for now. Um, I feel it. I feel that, I used to think that the best healthiest diet for a human being would be a Vegan diet with like three or four ounces of meat thrown in it at every meal.

Speaker 1:          01:08:12       You know, just to have the animal fat and animal protein. I like that would be really smart. Now I'm starting to think the opposite. I think front loading your body with the nutrients that it needs because our body's always in search for nutrients. That's why we're hungry. We're always searching for the nutrients that we need, the vitamins and minerals that we need and all the macro nutrients we need. If we front load at first and give us a, you know, a chunk, a nice steak, you're body's not hungry afterwards. And I think that's what's happened to me, where now I'm sort of giving my body what it needs and it never, it's never asking for what it doesn't need.

Speaker 2:          01:08:44       I saw a comment the other day and one of those animal videos when those horrible factory farming videos said, because of this video, I'm 60% vegan now with my diet. What exactly, what the fuck does that mean? But that's the type of morons we're dealing with here. People that are not looking at themselves or anything, honestly, they, they're, they're trying to stand on the moral high ground and they've, if they know the meat, they can't. So they say, well baby, I'm almost all Vegan. Well, okay, well those poor little fucking cows in murder. The 40% almost everybody who eats a balanced diet, 60% vegan. That's riddick. Exactly. I mean that's, it's a ridiculous thing to say, but this is the problem is people, they're not just eating things, they're posturing like outs there. They're publicly posturing on their position on, on morals and ethics. You know, you see it all the time.

Speaker 2:          01:09:37       Yeah. We see it in every aspect of fitness. We see it. Oh yeah. You see in all areas. But I think there's also a difference between, um, you know, survival and there's a difference between performance. And I think, you know, we're asking our bodies, all three of us at the table, we're asking our bodies to do some demanding thing. So I think in that case like maybe we do need a little bit more meat, especially if meat is going to be kind of our main driver of our calories. And it kind of makes sense that we would need a little bit more of that than maybe your average person. So what you said about the three ounces of meat, every couple meals probably makes sense and probably be great for survival. The other thing that's really interesting though is that even for those of us had been trying to seek the truth and for those of us have been trying to eat good and trying to train and it's not like you're like, oh, there's Joe Rogan hundred 50 years old. Look at that fucking guy. Yeah. You know, we still don't really, uh, you know, you're not insuring anything, right. But, uh, you're trying to just live the life that you want to live the best way possible that you can live at. Yeah. If I lived to be 150 those last couple of years are going to suck effect. I last couple. Well, I'm mean, I'm not convinced that people won't in our lifetime. I mean with, with science and fucking stem cells,

Speaker 1:          01:10:47       they said right now, if you're born today, you have a chance of living to be one oh four is like that

Speaker 2:          01:10:52       one oh four, I'm going to live to be one of four bitch hit by a car. Yeah. Asteroids.

Speaker 1:          01:10:56       The thing is, you and I and a lot of their people listening, we started 30, 40 years in. You know what I mean? We started too late. I don't know when you started eating better, but I know that it wasn't your whole life.

Speaker 2:          01:11:07       No, no, it wasn't my whole life. Um, I was certainly no high refined carbohydrate up until 10

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       years ago. Yeah. I mean I've really got into, I mean, I've always been supplementing with vitamins and I've been getting my blood work done for a couple of decades now, but the real shift was switching to Quito. Genic do you know where the shift came from? Me? And you're probably not going to believe this. The shift came from me after going to a show where I first met you, very time we first met. I don't even know if you remember it. Uh, it was outside the Ice House in Pasadena. And I came up to you and talk to you with Brian Callen and you were talking about diet and you were saying, man, I can't believe that people eat all this shit. And like, you know, you say every town I go to, I like, the first thing I do is look for the whole foods and I find the whole foods and I go get my food.

Speaker 3:          01:11:55       And I'm thinking like, man, I travel all the time. If Joe Rogan can do this, like, why am I not doing it? You know, why am I being so lazy with my Diet? I'm so fat, like what's going on? And I that day actually really made me think about a lot and I, I saw you as an inspiration after that day. I started really digging into it a lot more so. Well, I spend a lot of time in hotel. So what I would do is I would show up at a place on Thursday and I'd be there til Sunday, you know, especially when I was doing comedy clubs on the road. So I go to whole foods. I'd stock up on Kombucha, I would get a, a bunch of healthy snacks, a bunch of raw almonds and things along those lines. So that way I had something in my hotel room all the time.

Speaker 3:          01:12:31       So if I'm writing or you know, getting done working out or something like that, I'm not eating candy bars. I'm done rating the hotel minibar and eat bullshit. That makes all the difference in the world doc. And that's how I travel now too. I just have everything ready to go. Yeah. Get a breath. Bring yourself a big case of bottled water, you know, make, make sure you got stuff in your room that can sustain you. And if it carnivores, does it bring some, uh, sardines in a can? Yes, I do a lot of that. I bring sardines. I bring a oysters, I bring oysters with me. You're not going to believe this. My first sardine I've ever eaten was like two days ago. Actually. I just so, because you guys talk about it so much d'agostino we went and visited Dom D'agostino and interviewed him. He just kept talking about these sardines, so I'm like, finally I got to try it.

Speaker 3:          01:13:14       They taste just like tuna fish. The great southern. Great. I can't believe you'd never had sardines. Awesome. They're great. It sounds gross. It they sound gross, but I had him like about two weeks ago as well, maybe maybe a month or two. Wild. The Wild Planet. Wild Planet. Olive oil. Yeah. They also have macro and a bunch of other different things that I was used to. The ones that my grandfather get, we like peel the can down and then it was like these little little fish in there. Those I love those look too gross to me, so that's what I remember seeing as Sardi man, they're good. I like sardines are very healthy for you as long as, well, one thing though, I do have to say I was eating a can or two a day and then I found arsenic in my blood. That's right. I heard that. Yeah. And then the doctor's like, just lay off that, let's do another test in a month. And then it was gone. And so it's just the, there's a lot of heavy metals in the water and they're, they're low on the, uh, in the, in the ocean floor. I mean, they're down there with all that shit. Yeah. Speaking of fish and stuff like that, I do, it's important for people

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       to get some Omega threes and if they are going to try a carnivore diet and a way to do that as either eat the grass fed beef or to add in some a salmon. So I add in salmon twice a week, usually just pokey or something like that. Just eat it, eat it by itself.

Speaker 4:          01:14:25       Oils. Uh, what about just getting some fish oil and, and taking that in.

Speaker 1:          01:14:30       Ah, so I like, I like whole foods and I like things in the whole food environment. And the more I do research on things and look into it, the more I realize like the whole foods are really where it's at. So I don't know. I mean I'm, I'm, I'm sure there's a lot of studies on it and things like that, but I just feel like, um, the way that the way that they make fish oil and the way that it sits around forever and stuff like that, I don't know. So I don't use it, you know. Um, one of the things I do use because I can't, I can't stand eating it. Second, stand to eat the fish. I like the fish. I like the salmon. Um, I do not like liver, but beef liver is the highest and nutrients you want to talk about a superfood is like these true superfood. Yeah. Way More than keen water. And there's so many nutrients in beef liver, but I don't like it. So I take beef liver tablets or capsules or whatever. Oh, I love liver and those tastes, yeah. I don't know that I don't like it. I don't know how to cook it, so I've never actually made it. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:15:23       All you do is take a dusting of like ketogenetic flower, like almond flour or something like that. Put It on there and fried in butter. Just fry it, slice that baby up. Then fry with onions. You like onions, you're going to see a youtube video then. Huh Dude, I got some elk liver. If you want to try that, that'll, that'll fuck off. You think beef liver strong. He'd take out elk lever. You're like, Yo, whoa. You can deadlift liverwurst and I thought it was pretty good. Well, yeah, that's a different thing kyle. It was pretty good too though.

Speaker 1:          01:15:52       Your Buddy Kyle Kingsbury, he recommended the liverwurst and I was, yeah, then I didn't want to do it. And um, it's good. It's just like mixed in with other stuff or something really good.

Speaker 4:          01:16:02       I don't know what's in livermore, so that's a good question. It's liver and kidneys and hearts and let's find out. Well, all those things are great. Organ meat is the best meat for you. And liver in particular. That's why wolves, when the Alpha is established in the pack, the Alpha will always eat the wolf or eat the liver first. I can one, there was a, there was this crazy, uh, thing that this guy was doing where he was living with wolves and a, he had established himself as the Alpha in the pack. And one of the ways he would do that, they would have a kill and he would plant a liver inside the kill and then he would eat the liver and grout, all the other worlds. We would let him go because he's got the liver because once the, but then he had to leave in order to help someone else. This guy had a farm that was being attacked by wolves and so he set up some speakers and had some other wolves howl and essentially try to convince these wolves that were killing these guys. Uh, animals that a new pack had been in town. And with these big speakers, these other wolves were like, Holy Shit, there's a lot of fucking wolves here. Let's get outta here. And he is literally worth, but he was gone for a while, I think for a couple months and when he came back, the other walls were like, fuck you motherfucker. Where

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       the Alpha now and he almost got killed by these walls. It's terrifying to watch him whimpering in front of these walls while these wolves are like inches away from him with their teeth, like big fucking wolves. Matt, why is the idea that while he was doing studies on walls and they were all contained in this large fenced in area, which is also highly criticized because there's some videos on, on uh, youtube that you could see of these wolves attacking this one Beta wolf. And one of the reasons why that behavior, so essentially it is the fact that they are contained in a very small area. I mean it's big in that it's a few acres, but it's small in terms of law, what a wolf's natural roaming would be. They do say that animals tend to go for the liver, like they know about it so long.

Speaker 3:          01:17:52       If you look at salmon, there's a, there'd be a bunch of salmon in a river and like there'd be a big chunk taken out of them, but the rest of the body would be there. And the reason it was a bear would basically rip out its liver. And that's what, uh, that's what it was after. That's when the sector and full surplus or Sam and everyone go get four or five livers, you know, because it wanted to eat that. So it's like looking at the salmon, almost like an egg and that's the egg yolk, you know, that's, that's an important part. Yeah. Most animals, like most predatory animals, they go for the guts first. It's really weird. And back in the day, I think when they used to kill things, they would say that even human beings where you all the organs first. Oh yeah. I mean Origami Kidney Pie and she didn't like them.

Speaker 3:          01:18:31       I mean there was, but they didn't know they were doing it for nutrition. They just didn't want to waste anything. No, I think the party, I think you're right is great too. I've got some elkhart and then probably went with what tasted better. Right? Like you know, eventually, you know, if the heart tasted great, yeah, let's, yeah, the heart doesn't, it doesn't taste the best. The best is like backstrap and which is the loins are the tenderloins, you know, which is the inside. That stuff is the most tender. And a lot of people feel like it's the best. Some people like in a cow, they like in New York's trip it's like a more, uh, it's got a more richer taste. But most people don't find the liver to taste the best, but it's just cause it's a strong flavor. I don't know. I've always liked it.

Speaker 3:          01:19:10       I've always liked liver beef, liver desiccated beef. Liver capsules actually tastes like a fart. I mean when you, when you burp. Ah, no. Just when, when when you take them, you can drink as much water as you want. You're always going to get that little like, oh well he's like, he's like a fart. Wow. You know, it's like when you eat the meat, it doesn't taste like that. We eat the meat of the liver. It doesn't, it doesn't taste that. I don't think you guys should be high end farts. Now, Chris Kresser is a big proponent of Oregon. Me and he said when he had a bunch of autoimmune issues as well, and he said that auto, that eating liver and heart and kidneys and stuff like that, all that stuff really helped him tremendously. I wish I like liverwurst more. It's not that I don't like it that much. Force yourself to eat it, man, and force yourself to eat cow's liver when you don't really have problems. You're getting calves liver most of the time, which is kind of fucked up. You're, even though you're right, if you do for chuffed to edit, your ended up actually liking and I was like, Huh. You know sometimes you can eat it in a place that cooks it. If you go to a

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       really good restaurant that serves liver and onions, a good restaurant that serves it, it's delicious. It's just you've got to find someone who knows how to prepare it properly. Yeah. You teach your kids eat healthy or is it just kind of like they just watch a night kind of like off of everything. It's really unusual. They've been eating from the time they were really little. I started hunting in 2012 so for the last six years they've been eating wild game. So from the time they were little, like my seven year old, she doesn't know anything different. She's eaten beef for sure. She eats hot dogs and normal stuff that kids eat, but she's been eating elk and bear and deer and you know, Moose her whole life. She's the wild Turkey. She's eaten like basically all the different things that people hunt for. She's eaten since she was a little kid.

Speaker 4:          01:20:52       You guys talk about nutrition at all? Yes. Yes. Well the other thing that my kids eat that's really spectacular to watch as they love Kimchi, especially my youngest, she loves probiotics, which is crazy. Yeah. We give them probiotics in supplements. We give them probiotics and in terms of yogurt and acidophilus and, and these little uh, Bio k formulas that are pretty rich and they taste pretty good too. There's some sugar in there, unfortunately, but, but getting your kids into really healthy probiotic foods, it's interesting. What's interesting is how quickly they snap back from colds, how, how resistant they are to them and how quickly they snap back for them because they have this healthy biome, this healthy immune system. Kimchi is one of my, I had some Kimchi today. I eat it almost every day. I get this a, there's a company called mother-in-laws Kimchi. It's my favorite and I'll buy like five jars at a time and I go through those fuckers in like two weeks. You don't see it by itself. I came to you with meat most of the time I'll slice meat and put Kimchi on it. And if the two of them together don't, people bury that shit like in their backyard. Koreans do. Yeah. They make a pot and it ferments and the bird in their bag,

Speaker 1:          01:21:59       it's really good for your gut microbiome. And the more we find out about that, that's why I was saying like what I'm doing is an intervention. I'm not going to just eat meat forever. Right. Um, because I, the next, the next step for me is once I get to the point where I feel like I'm lean enough to where I want to be, I still want to lose about 10 pounds. And you really, yeah, I get leaner. You lean still have a lot of belly fat that's been around from my drinking everyday for so the upper abs come in, but then the lower abs is still, uh, you know, so we got out, we had tightened. I shut up.

Speaker 4:          01:22:29       Other than Peter Luger going off the rails, I've been on a strict diet for two weeks and I've lost five pounds. What's your diet? Which you just meat and vegetables. That's mostly it.

Speaker 1:          01:22:39       And any sort of a rhyme or reason or you just eat as much as you want when you want or,

Speaker 4:          01:22:43       I got a little fat. I got up to about 200 and that's what I'm fat and I, I like to be like right now I was one 94 after my run. Some probably like one 96.

Speaker 1:          01:22:53       It's amazing. We weighed the same exact weight one 94 this morning.

Speaker 4:          01:22:56       Yeah. Just became best friends. Ah, did we just become, yeah, I like to be, I think if I'm really, if I'm shredded, I'm down at about one 90. Yeah. That's what I think. I'm really, so I think I need, I could lose another four pounds. I think being mindful as a key factor, you know that you're like I'm getting fat. Hold yourself to a standard. I tell people all the time try to be made as something different. Yeah. The only way I know how to like build up, uh, any self esteem or you know, build up self respect or any of these things is through training or through diet. I can't really do it through a business meeting. I can't do it just through like reading a book. You can get motivated by watching a youtube video or something, but that lasts you a couple hours. Maybe it lasts you for the week.

Speaker 4:          01:23:36       Maybe it helps point in the right direction, which is cool. Well the thing about it for martial arts, especially for striking is when you lose weight, you move faster. It's like if I, if I went out there and hit the bag and I put a 40 pound weight vest on, strap that fucker and I would feel slower. I mean I just would, I just, there's no way around it. Well, even 10 pounds makes a difference. When I used to fight, one of the things that I noticed when I would get down close to my weight class is I just move quicker because I was carrying around less weight. I felt, I felt like I was less to move around. Like my muscles are essentially as strong and probably lost a little bit of muscle when you lose weight, but most of it was there, but my body fat on my body weight was down several pounds and I would just move quicker.

Speaker 4:          01:24:17       You used to be tough as a fighter to gauge that too though. Like when you lose too much, like maybe like one almost wanting to avoid food to feel faster. You. You see that with a lot of UFC fighters when they get down too low in weight, they just can't perform properly and this, that, and I think there's a real issue with MMA and that issue is there's not enough weight classes. I, they're very, very strongly about this. I think there's giant gaps like one 85 to two oh five drives me fucking crazy. It's a 20 that's a gap. That's a tough area to, because guys can be so muscular that way, or skinny I it does it. Well, it's really how tall they are, whatever. But it's really like what is your optimal and the idea that people would fit in between that 20 pounds optimal either this way or that way.

Speaker 4:          01:25:01       It's crazy because those two oh five guys, a lot of them could be heavyweights like Jon Jones. Jon Jones could be the heavyweight champion of the world. 100% no doubt about it, no fucking doubt about it. Yet. He's still in ways two oh five when he fights and he doesn't have a hard time making that weight. Now if you're a guy like say Hector Lombard, who's fought at one 70 and just really packs a lot of meat on, and he fights it one 85 you know it, when he fights at one 85 he could, he's also fought at two oh five before I believe if he decided to fight it one at two Oh five and John Jones decides to fight it to a five I mean hector's my height and Jon Jones towers over me. So you're looking at just a totally different body size and totally different frame that 20 pounds is too much man.

Speaker 4:          01:25:44       And then from two oh five to heavyweight, you could get some brock Lesnar motherfucker that or Francis and Ghana who has to cut weight to make two 65 frances even more impressive. Right, because he's natural. I mean, he's not even barely lifting weights. I mean that guy is just a fucking gigantic super athlete. So that guy doesn't really lift. No, it's huge. Huge. He got that big from working in a fucking sand mine. Oh my God, this is, I mean, he literally is like Conan the barbarian from the Robert E. Howard Nigerian. He is from Cameroon I believe. Right? I think that's where he's from. He, there's videos of him on his instagram from yesterday of him back in the same sand mine and he's wearing his fucking Reebok Jersey with his name on the back of it, digging sand with all the guys who used to work with.

Speaker 4:          01:26:33       It's fucking crazy. But that is hard labor and it's, there it is. Do that all day. Dig fucking stand all day. You know how fucking strong you had been just carrying 20 pound hunks of sand and shoving them into the top of that truck all day long. He's a beast. Well he's uh, he's got tremendous genetics. His father has built a chem two. There's a picture of him on his instagram when he was three years old standing next to his father and you look at his daddy like, oh Jesus, like the apple on the tree. They are baby. You think he's going to be pretty dangerous coming up? Like the only issue with Francis, his wrestling and his uh, in his endurance, and this is just based on his fight with steep emile chick who in my opinion is the best heavy weight ever. I think if you look at what Steve Pays managed to do in his career, uh, he's defended the title more than anybody.

Speaker 4:          01:27:22       He knocked out for breezy over Dune was one of the best ever. He knocked out Alistair Overeem, he beat Francis and Ghana who everybody was fucking terrified of and Francis been blowing everybody out of the water, including Alistair overeem. I just think and knocked out junior dos Santos, also former heavyweight champion. I think Steve pays the best of all time. So when you know, Steve [inaudible] is able to beat you and beat you by using his wrestling and using his smarts and using his, his octagon intelligence and just his overall fight Iq, he just knows how to fight better. He's just got more tools in the toolbox. Frances can learn and he's an incredible athlete and what he has over everybody, his power, he has more power in his punch. We have a machine out there called the power cube and that machine Francis registered the highest ever power punch by like 10,000 units, whatever the fuck that means.

Speaker 4:          01:28:12       So tyrone spong, who's a super powerful heavyweight boxer, he scored like one 19 I think it was an f or one 14 and then Francis scored 1209209000 and you see it when he hits people. And that's about what you kick, right? You get your check a little bit more than that. So that's, I kicked in the face. I hold the record right now until somebody beats ago. We'll hold the red one 5,252 from a kick. That's, but again, look at the size of my leg, like carrying around 196 pounds all day, running hills with 196 pounds. Try, try doing fucking handstands and running up a hill with handstands. You just can't, you're arms are not that strong. And also, you know, I've been kicking my whole life, he's really only been training him in Maine for five years. Yeah. So he's just, he's fun to watch.

Speaker 4:          01:28:58       He's amazing to watch. It's like a old Tyson fight. Yeah. Even the match, even a fight with us. Steve Bay was kind of scary cause he just kept getting back up and it was like, it was like watching now Mike Myers like a horror movie or something. Michael Myers and, or Freddy Kruger or something just kept coming back. It doesn't have the wrestling experience. It doesn't have the wrestling technique. But what he has is a incredible heart and desire and he's very hungry to learn. And I'm, I'm very hopeful that he's going to learn and you know, and I really, really hope that he incorporates, um, of real rigorous wrestling program because that was one thing that was lacking from his last, uh, it was the last training camp when he fought for steep pen. I think you have seen needs a 300 and up club, I think. So, you know, to have that, have that weight class and then have him only fight for a minute and rest for like five minutes.

Speaker 4:          01:29:42       Well there's nothing I issue is there's not enough fighters. There's not enough guys, you know, but not enough big boys. Yeah. Maybe you just like put, you saw it on the back burner for up to 65 and I'm going to do whatever you want. Um, you know, uh, you know, I'm, I'm hopeful that Francis still, I mean, he's a little older in terms of like being this new to the sport at 33, you know, I mean, it really didn't even start training until he was 28. I mean, he's kind of crazy. He was homeless. Yeah. I mean, you want to talk about our amazing story that's like right out of a movie. The guy was homeless, came from Africa where he worked in a fucking sand mine and then gets to the number one contender spot in the UFC. But there's guys now, uh, like, uh, um, Alexander Volkov is that Volcom Volkov cough.

Speaker 4:          01:30:36       Um, the guy who just knocked out, um, February over doom. He's this, this is a giant guy. Like he's a huge, I think he's six, seven cheese. Yeah. And incredibly skillful. So there's, there's these guys that are coming up that are like at the higher end of the way class. How do you say his last name? Volkov right. I W I always get confused because Russians say things with Russian accent. I was under the vocal vocal Volkov is find out if that's the case, if he that tall. He is, he's six, seven, yeah. He's a incredibly long and efficient and he has real power. He, and he's hard to hit man, but his game is so well rounded. The difference between him and a guy likes, you know, um, uh, Francis is, he's not new to the game. I mean he's a giant guy who's been fighting for a long fucking time, so he is a real efficient martial artists.

Speaker 4:          01:31:36       When he fought Fabrizio Verdon I could tell early on the striking exchanges like, wow, fabrizio might be in trouble. Like this guy is, he's long, he knows that the stay on the outside and he knows he's got an excellent sense of distance and he's got legit knockout power and he fucked fabrizio up, man. That was, that was hard to watch. I was like, wow, this guy's, he's legit. It's amazing. These longer body types have been so good. Anderson Silva Bounce Jones. Yeah. A lot of these guys have, you know, you wouldn't think that, you know, you'd think someone may be shorter stockier and getting the inside. But did he seize up long? Seems like a huge beat Saturday night. Sharapov say that five times fast. Like I said, well before we came on the podcast, as soon as he came on, I'm going six to one 45 you can find a skinnier guy I thought.

Speaker 4:          01:32:23       And then I saw him fight and man, he was just so impressive. But fast and strong live at one 45 and six two I guess voice was, you know, he wasn't real tall but he was like six one right. But he was one 75 mm. And you know, he was obviously fighting in the unlimited class and he was fighting guys like Dan Severn at the time. It was two 65 feet is thin, but he's got muscle on him if he's kind of jacked. Like when you looked at it like a perfect frame. He's all almost awesome, a little tiny luke rockhold and a lot of ways, but with a way more dynamic game. He could do everything. That guy, he was really interesting to watch this first time I ever saw him. Fight Dot guy is fucking phenomenal. He's so talented. That was the first time I saw him fight live and it's a different thing when you see someone live.

Speaker 4:          01:33:05       Like if you see someone in a video and you go, wow, that guy's good. But they, you see him live and you know your brain has like a little computer where it's seen or you know you've got, they've got a database, especially me, I've seen so many fights, have a database of how people move and then you see that guy moving. You're like, Whoa, what are we looking at here? Because I love seeing that. I love seeing this next level shit, that next level thing. Like whether it's you know, connor or whether it's a tyron woodley or these, every now and then you see next level and you go, oh, like tyron woodley to me. He fought Carlos condit and there was a moment in the condit fight where he stepped forward and snap Carlos with a a straight right hand. I was like, Whoa, that's like 10% faster than it should be.

Speaker 4:          01:33:48       You know what I mean? Like you, you get used to world class athletes moving and then you see someone like Edson Barboza switch kick. That's another one. You're like, Whoa, whoa baby. You know. But to me the biggest example that is Nurburg of madoff's wrestling Khabib takes how, my God, everybody, everybody who's good, how failed though? Just Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, black belt, world champion, rag dolls, rag dolls, everybody, Michael Johnson. I mean, no matter who he fights, he ragdolled this guy in the beginning and I thought it was over right away. I was like, oh, this is over and that. But I can't say did, did really well, did very well. Very well. The thing about higher quinta is he's a legit crazy person. Like that guy's crazy. He trashes hotel rooms. He's like, you look at his eyes like, oh, there's only like a's, the guy, a couple of people home.

Speaker 4:          01:34:39       It's not a full village in that head. That's not a good example. But what I'm saying like he's a legit maniac and he's not scared. Like he'll fight anybody. Like you could wake him up at three o'clock in the morning and he'll fight. Anybody made crazy thing. He was screaming. He was running around the hotel lobby the day when, when we found out Max Holloway could not make weight. And the new, by the way, I shouldn't say could not make weight. I believe Max would have made the way they did in New York State Athletic Commission, which they made some, they made some big errors and I can go into detail with a couple of them. One of them is they wouldn't let Paul felder fight. Um, Paul felder wanted to fight. They said he's not ranked. Paul felder is a fucking killer. He is a straight up killer.

Speaker 4:          01:35:21       And him versus Khabib would have been a very interesting fight because Paul is a big one 55. He's very big and very strong and he is an expert world class striker. I mean Paul felder is a dangerous, dangerous man for anybody. In 155 pounds and he's a grounded pound expert. He's also get very good defense in, in everything. Very good defense, standing up. Very good defense on the ground. He felt his fucking well rounded. I would have been very intrigued in that fight and they offered it to felder fell this had fuck. Yeah. And then in Nevada state or the, excuse me, New York State Athletic Commission said, I was like, you guys are out of your fucking minds. You don't know shit about fighting if you don't think that guy could fight for the title because Paul might be fighting for the title in a year from now or whenever.

Speaker 4:          01:36:02       I mean he's fucking world class. So the fact that they don't know that and they're saying, well, based on the rankings, the rankings are horse shit. They're arbitrary. They're made by a bunch of people that I think a lot of times they're biased. They have terrible judgment. Sometimes the guy will fuck a guy up and then you look at the rankings and he's below that guy. He just fucked up in the rankings. Explain that there was no other way to tell if a guy's better than who we fucked up. And they say, wow, it was past experience suck fat dicks. That past experience doesn't mean anything. This guy just date, this guy beat the guy who beat the guy. That guy beat him. Well if he was number one, now he's number one. That's how it goes. You can't get knocked out and still be number one.

Speaker 4:          01:36:39       That's fucking bananas. And this is often the case when you see a guy beat a guy and he's still below the guy in the rank. He's like, what the fuck else can he do? How did you end up with the guy? How did they end up getting I acquainted? Then they just asked him. He was in, he was the next guy in line. He's on a four or five fight win streak. Um, and he's beaten some very good guys like Jorge Mosfet doll, uh, Ross Pearson. He's beaten some legit guys. I mean, look, I Quinta can bang and he's tough as shit and he's got a wrestling background, which I think played a big factor in that fight. Obviously he was greatly outclass by a guy who I think is one of the greatest lightweight of all time. And now that he's the champion, I'm very interested in seeing.

Speaker 4:          01:37:19       But I think what, what we saw in that fight that was very intriguing was the fact that I acquaint it was able to get back up and that I quit was one of the few guys that number go madoff has ever fought, that has stuffed a bunch of take downs and then into the late rounds. And this is a guy in owl that didn't even prepare for a five round fight. He was getting ready for a three round fight with Paul felder. So I mean fucking props to ally La Quinta. I mean fucking animal. Great job. I was off animal and major props to the could that Kyle Bochniac kit that [inaudible] beat that kid and savage cause he ate everything. He was smiling, punched in the face, smiling and coming off the end of the fight and the three rounds of a clinic, I mean he's a beat put on a clinic.

Speaker 4:          01:38:03       He did everything, jumped, spinning back kicks, roundhouse tricks, switch kicks. He hit him with a switch kick. There was like Jesus Bochniac took a couple to the neck rack and still kept calm and still kept common blood coming out of his nose, his mouth stickin Freemason, sticking his tongue out on him. And then as a beat, it's like, what the fuck do I got to do to this guy? At the end of it blocked me, acts, got him pinned up against the cage and he's throwing bombs and was crazy. The whole place. The entire Barclay Center on their feet. Fuck. I stood up, I was screaming and cop and it was phenomenal. Phenomenal. That's what I love, you know. And that was in my mind, that was worth the price of admission for the whole paper with your car, just to see who's the best fight for sure.

Speaker 4:          01:38:43       Yeah, for sure. But to see our do that just shows you that, you know, Al is a legit worldclass fighter. You mean? Definitely is not on the level of could be, but nobody thought he was coming in. I think it was, uh, in a lot of ways an upset, just the fact that he was able to go to the distance and you see what could be did to so many other fighters mean he mall different else and he mauled out for a lot of the fight. I mean, look, the guy's the best wrestler at one 55 ever. I mean, ever. He does things to worldclass guys that makes you just confused because he's not, it's like there's certain guys that are doing things like ya year Rodriguez is a perfect example. He does wild shit. He does like jump three 60 roundhouse kicks. He threesixty roundhouse kicks Bj Penn and the fate and you're like, what the fuck?

Speaker 4:          01:39:31       So this is like a guy doing something to the other guy with the other guy. Just can't do that. He can't move that way. Number of Madoff is doing standard stuff, but he's doing it at such a high level that he'd makes world class fighters, questioned their career. He takes them in malls, them and they have a different sense of where they fit in the universe. It's crazy to see somebody come back from that when they're getting the shit beat out of them. They're getting hit so hard. You're like, what makes you, and I've had, I've had some fighters and stuff that, that I've talked to you in the past and a lot of times they don't even know that how fucking bat shit crazy they are. I did pro wrestling for for a handful of years and when I was wrestling, a lot of times we'd share the ring and so on and a lot of times like the UFC fighters, they would say, you guys are fucking crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:40:17       What are you guys doing in there? Fucking jumping off the top rope. I'm like, we're crazy with the fit. You're doing fucking out of this world. Well, I've goofed around about pro wrestling before, but my honest feelings, all, all bullshit aside. This is one of the toughest professions in all of entertainer. Udl. It is unbelievably. It is gay though. That's why I was in it just for the gay style. Exactly. It's not, you know, it's, it's not a sport, it's entertainment, but you have to be incredibly athletic to do some shit they do. And the beating those guys take this in terms of their body, it's, it's very underappreciated cause you just watch it and you go, oh, it's not real. They're not really fighting. But no, they're really hitting each other with chairs. They're really jumping off the top rope. It's slamming each other.

Speaker 4:          01:40:58       I mean all the crazy shit that they do, the, the toll those guys take on their body is an unbearable, like what we're saying about Kurt Angle, like that guy has gone through a fuck load. I mean, see if you can find that picture. I think it's on Ronda Rousey's instagram page. Ronda Rousey with Kurt Angle at the end of their match and you're looking at it 50 he won Olympic gold medal with a broken neck and he's still going to be a gold medal with his neck was broken. Then he won the Olympics. Brogan freaking night, not like broken in half. It was fractured. He had a fracture in his neck and he's still one. What the fuck down. It wasn't supposed to restaurant. No, no, no, no. Not that. That was a good one. But the one with the arms raised, is it on hers? Maybe it's not.

Speaker 4:          01:41:42       There it is right there. Look at that. Look at his arms, man. Yeah, that's your feed. Yeah. Look at that left arm. I mean that's crazy. It looks like, no, no offense Jamie. It looks like Jamie's arm. Jim, you've got big arms. You do have big arms. I mean you do, but you have big arms for a normal guy. He's a god. Go Gorilla. Normal. Yeah, for normal. Well your your athletic, but your guy. I'm not saying anything bad, but I'm saying that for the size of what he used to look like. Go back. Look at the size of his fucking neck, dude. What is that thing right below his ear? What is that? That's his neck. What is that? That's your fucking, that's like, I just gotta go for living in his neck. You know the way those guys train their neck is crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:42:19       The way that dude's with bridges and shit and then that's just not good for you man. I don't think so. But there's an article about that recently where they were describing like the dangers of neck bridging. You know, he does strengthen your neck. Well wrestling, they do a lot of shit that's not great for you. I don't think rightly, it's kind of part of the par for the course. Right. With collegiate style wrestling. Do you ever fuck with that iron neck? I like it. Yeah. I love that. I like it. I love that they use it for some dead lifts the other day and I felt I felt stronger, legitimately felt stronger. Oh, it's phenomenal. I actually used it and didn't know that I had an issue with my neck until I used it and then after I used it, um, wait a second, I can turn my head all the way now.

Speaker 4:          01:42:56       So I think it's great. One of the things about it is the range of motion that it gives you and for grapplers I think it is mandatory. I think it would, it's a mandatory thing for, I fucked my neck up for a bunch of reasons. One, from being an idiot and not tapping to from getting injured and still training, but three, because one of my biggest moves is the arm triangle. So in the arm triangle when you grow, get a head and arm choke. When I got the art guys arm trapped here, I'm using my neck, so I'm constantly like pinning things down with my neck and you know, you're rolling for a fucking hour a night or whatever it is. It's a lot of pressure you're putting on your neck and then defending things with your neck and everything gets inflamed and everything's injured and you get these little micro injuries that never really heal because you're back training again. Yeah, the iron neck thing works great to, I think we both looked at it kind of skeptical when we first saw it and then the guy did a demo for us and we both used it and thought it was really cool. And you put on this from your helmet. It looks weird and I ended up beginning,

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       you're, you're like, what is this thing? You know? And then it works great.

Speaker 4:          01:43:54       But I mean, even one of those harnesses with a weight, just anything where you're, you know, just constantly conditioning your neck and your neck needs workout. It really does. It's when you know you're serious about trainings when you have a fucking neck harness. Yeah man. Yeah. I've always had that one back in the day. I'm a big believer in working out your neck, you know, and John Jacques Machado, my Jujitsu instructor is a very famous quote. He says, never trust your neck. Hmm. Yeah. Never Trust your neck. You know, like if you think that you'll see, you know, if someone's choking you, it's like, don't just think that your neck is strong enough to handle it. Fuck that. Protect your neck. Yeah. Kurt Angle looks like he's got over 20 inch neck or something. I mean, it's cute. It looks like he's pushing his head off his fucking shoulders. It's, yeah, it's like two of my thighs holding his fucking head up. But I mean, it's probably just to support his neck with all the injuries of the guys had. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure he's got fused disks or something going on up there, right?

Speaker 1:          01:44:46       Yeah. He got, he had surgery a couple of times. He said, yeah, actually, um, you know, he was addicted to drugs. Now he's doing a big thing, um, on sobriety. And, uh, he was, he was, um, heavily addicted to like opioids for a long time and he actually got us our, he actually went to the point where, um, I believe it was a situation where it was either the drugs or he gets fired and he basically got fired from ww or released or is con, you know, whatever, whatever happened. But I'm sort of went down a really bad road and it's as good to see him back and be held back being like, as you know, as healthy as he can be at this point because, uh, he went through a really rough time. You know,

Speaker 4:          01:45:23       I loved your documentary prescription thugs, and I've shown it and recommended it to so many people. I just think we live in a crazy time. You're, you're hearing all the time someone's cousin and my brother or this guy, my mom, people get injured, they get on pills and then they wind up dying or they go down that road and they become addicts. Yeah. It's, it is a fucking, not so silent but epidemic in this country. And a lot of people feel completely helpless because they're getting prescribed these things by their doctor, so they think they should take them. And then, you know, you watch your friend drift away. I mean, it happened to one of my family members. I watched my family member go from being an, a normal guy to being a total fucking loser. And it's just because he hurt his back and he got hooked on pills and the next thing you can't keep a job. And he's always on the pills. And he never did shit when I knew him, I grew up with this kid. He was totally normal and now he's all fucked up and it's just,

Speaker 1:          01:46:17       is he still messed up? Yeah, I still fucked up. He doesn't want to get sober. I can't, I can't, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:46:22       Do you know when you're a kid, you can't hold someone's hand? You can't. You can't. I mean, he lives in Boston. I can't fly to Boston and fucking holds his hand

Speaker 1:          01:46:29       sharing that. We have, we have a cousin who's an alcoholic and, um, and he's in his thirties, you know, he needs a liver transplant and, oh, and you still goes and drinks in this fucking thirties. Yeah. And, um, damn, you know, and it's just a shame because we love him and he's our cousin, but there's nothing that we can do to help him. I've tried to help him so many times, even oftener offering to

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       bring them out here to go to Rehab for free, um, because of the people I know. And um, he didn't take me up on it and I, that kind of thing is crazy and we lost our uncle, we lost her brother to from this kind of thing. And it's brutal. Brutal. It runs rampant. It does. And it's so easy for people to get lost. I mean, Shab Shab broke his nose and the cro, cop, cro, cop smashed his nose with an elbow and he had to get his nose reconstructed. And when he got his nose reconstruct that they put him on pills and next thing you know he's taking those pills all day long and it's four months later. And his buddies grabbed him and they went to his house and they, they, they opened up as medicine cabinet, they threw everything away and they go, this is it.

Speaker 3:          01:47:27       It's over. You're not doing this anymore, man. Fuck. And he's like, you're right, you're right. And you went cold Turkey. Yeah. And Luckily Brendan is a strong guy mentally. And he got off of it and that was it. And he likes to talk about it cause it's, it's an important thing because he goes, I would have never thought that I would get addicted to drugs. It's such a sickness. I remember the last, the last time I did Percocet, uh, was at a UCLA USC game and I took a bunch of cars. I was like, I'm going to be sitting through this game the whole time. I'll take the whole bottle. I took 30 of them with me to this game. 30 30 pills. What do you mean with me to this game? This is even gets even better. I sit down in my seat and right behind me is the doctor who runs the, who owns the clinic where I got my surgery done and meanwhile I'm high like super high talking to this doctor the whole time on the pills that he prescribed it to me.

Speaker 3:          01:48:14       You know, I did 30 pills during that game, you know, I, that's crazy. Did the doctor know that you're pilled up? I mean he would had to know. I mean, I don't know, but it's kind of like it was, we, it was a weird situation, but um, you know, getting, getting off those pills was, was necessary. It would have ended my life for sure. Now, if you had gotten a surgery tomorrow, let's say, what if your, your hip fucked up and they had to go back and Redo it? Would you take the pain pills? I would do, I would take the painkillers that as long as I was in the hospital, like whatever, whatever I'm supervised. Would you be scared though, that you would now jump right back in? I don't think it works that way. You know, like I, I don't, I don't think it'd be, you know, a trigger.

Speaker 3:          01:48:55       Um, but I wouldn't take them at home. I'd use Kratom or something else. And who knows? I don't know how good kratom would work after a surgery. Right, right, right. We don't know how it works at them. Did help you write, helps me phenomenally. Every single day. Yeah. My friend cams on that stuff too. He was a, he had a real problem with Ibuprofen for awhile. And then Doctor Rhonda Patrick did a podcast with me where she was talking about the dangers of Ibuprofen and all the different real severe side effects that people have from real injury. Your Gut microbiome, it ruins your libido and your, um, your sperm count too. Well, this is the, the gut microbiome was really fascinating because it causes inflammation and he was dealing with inflammation issues. So He'd wake up, his hips would hurt, his feet would hurt, his knees would hurt. So He'd take 800 milligrams of Ibuprofen. He would do it several times a day. That's what I was doing. But it was a cycle. So that was what was causing the inflammation because it was fucked up as gut microbiome.

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       So he gets off of it and then in, then he calls me and he's like, you can't fucking believe this man. He goes, I'm off in all, my pain's gone. He kept running because he's an animal. So he, he said it's, the pain's gone. He's like, the pain was being caused by the inflammation that was caused by Ibuprofen, like holy fucking shit. And he just thanked me. He's like, if it wasn't for Rhonda, Patrick, I, you know who not mean people get strokes. They have all sorts of funny, right? You're not supposed to take that. I mean, it's fine if you take it. I go, I have a headache. Take a little Ibuprofen. You'll be fine. It's not going to kill you. But if you take that shit, 800 milligrams a day for a couple of years, who the fuck knows what's going to do to you? Your body is not designed for nonsteroidal antiinflammatories on a daily basis, on very high doses over and over and over combined, you know, the advil, Ibuprofen and the Acetaminophen that it works even better.

Speaker 1:          01:50:34       So that's what I was doing. I would take about eight advil a day and eight tylenol a day. So I'm killing not only my liver, but my kidneys also. And you know, I've known a lot of people that have had transplants because of that. Um, have a kidney transplant because they're taking too much ibuprofen now. Um, your documentary, a leaf of faith, you still doing that? We finished it. Yeah. It comes out on, on May 29th and that's all about Kratom. Yeah, it's all about Kratom. It's sort of a, it's really about my experience with Kratom. It's about my journey, you know, like, Hey, I was this guy who lifted weights and did all these things and got hurt and this is what happened to me. And I just, I sort of tell the story and then as I tell the story, I go out and discover, you know, is Kratom good or bad for you?

Speaker 1:          01:51:17       And we talked to, we talked to both sides of the issue. We talked to the Congress people that are trying to ban it. We talked to the ones that are trying to save it and well, they're calling it an opiate now. Yeah. They call it, they definitely call it. It was a real recent, those are recent redefinition of the show that you and I did. Um, and in the movie you'll see it. It's very pivotal. Like what you do is awesome with this podcast, by the way. But what we, what we were able to do from that show is like basically you kept Kratom legal, uh, without even knowing it. So we did the podcast and then after the podcast, at the end of the podcast, he said, hey, if anybody wants to help, where can they go? And I said, they'd go on this website and they leave comments for the Dea will 23,000 people or maybe 24,000 people.

Speaker 1:          01:51:57       I can't remember left comments after your podcast. That's amazing. The Dea said, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, wait a second. We can't make this illegal. There's people go crazy. But what did they do recently? They definitely classified, it's totally illegal. That was the FDA, not the dea. The FDA came out. And, um, because, okay, so here's why really this why calls creative and opioid and warrants against using this up. And I'll tell you why. It's because hunts, uh, no, no, not at all. I like that the FDA is doing the right thing here. What? Yup. Dare you. Uh, I'll tell you what have you done with Chris? I'll tell you why. A lot of people are marketing Kratom the wrong way. They're packaging it the wrong way and they are not testing it. And when they're not testing it, you have things like a salmonella outbreak. I heard about that.

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       That hurt, you know, put 28 people or something in the hospital. So I forget how many people, but there was a salmonella outbreak and that's because a company buys Kratom from overseas, from like Indonesia. They get it shipped here and they don't test it for contaminants, you know. So the company that I did the film with a company called urban ice, they test all the products for contaminants three times during the process. You know, you own a supplement company, you know how it works. You have to test your shit independently. It's very important day party, independent testing. And that's what people aren't doing. And so they're trying to make, so they make it cheaper, you know, and then the companies that are doing it, that screws them because now they got to try to make their product cheaper to keep up with other people. But they're paying for the testing each time.

Speaker 4:          01:53:30       Well, the supplement business is almost on the honor system. You know, it's, it's really, it's really crazy. My friend Aubrey, whom I'm partners with an on it and uh, he was explaining to me how those big Dick pills work. Yeah. Uh, you know, when you buy them at the gas station and the hard on pills, he's like those pills, most of them have cialis or Viagra and I'm, yeah. And so they get busted. Somebody bust some and then once they bust them, they go, oh, sorry. They changed the name of the company, they sell it again and then they get busted again. And they just keep doing this because there's a little shuffle.

Speaker 1:          01:54:01       We're in the same thing with the Kratom industry based on, so what else

Speaker 4:          01:54:04       Susan Kratom like if you buy Kratom somewhere, what could it possibly be other than,

Speaker 1:          01:54:09       uh, well, so there's this, that happens sometimes. Yeah. And there's different acts actually happened in Sweden to the point where people died. So in Sweden, uh, they put fentanyl in with Kratom's Christ and nine nine people died. And I don't want to scare people off of a have taken it because I use it every day. Well, the spray company that you use, because that was the guy that's brought on the podcast, but Nice organics, that company have an ice organics. Yeah. And that stuff I've used and it's great. Yeah. That their website's natural organics with an x on the end.com.

Speaker 4:          01:54:38       What's interesting to me too is that in low doses, it's actually kind of a stimulant. Almost like a cup of coffee. Yeah. Burden, high doses. It's more relaxing.

Speaker 1:          01:54:46       Yeah. Yeah. Do you take it? I take it occasionally. Yeah. We have some in the back. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You did. Yeah. And I thought, ah, because you know, the thing is that, um, not everybody is in pain, but a lot of people feel stress. Stress is a big deal, you know, and um, Kratom really helps people with anxiety, ptsd. If someone has anxiety, like how many pills did they take for anxiety? But see I take two at a time. I think that's the problem we're getting into. I can't really tell people that stuff cause that's like illegal according to the FDA now I can because I'm a film maker. Right, right. Um, so I would say take two. But um, for the most part, like a company can't tell you that like a, you know, you as the owner of onnit can't say take this many pills and this whole like take this much alpha brain and it'll do this for your brain. Cause you, you say the wrong thing and the FDA's all over your ass. Right. So that's, that's an issue. Um, like the way that the way that Kratom needs to be marketed is like basically the way that supplements are supposed to be marketed is, you know, that you're taking it for a specific response

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       and the FDA doesn't let you tell people that, which is just really screwed up too. Because I think that that's a problem. It's like an issue. You know, like you should be able to say what it does. The problem is people make way too many health claims. So with Kratom they make the health claim that it will cure opioid addiction and that's a huge claim to make. And um, it's a ridiculous claim to make. It can help somebody get over an opioid addiction, but to say it cures and opioid addiction or to say that it, uh, even even will cure your pain or help your pain. Those are bigger claims then supplements are allowed to make. And that's the issue with people coming down on it. But is the thing like what helps you over an addiction? There's so many factors. First of all, there's genetics.

Speaker 3:          01:56:27       Some people have a genetic propensity for addiction. It's just the fact that runs in their family. And I don't know if that's nature and nurture, but cause I don't have it in my family, but some people do. I know people that they drink one drink and they get fucking job and they're off to the races. There was gone, they disappear. You know, people like that. Right. Yeah. And there was a big difference. My Dad says there was a big difference between our brother Mike and and me and the way that we did it. So I sort of fell into it. But Mike was kind of always that way. You fell into it because of surgery because surgery and constant pain because if you have, Mike fell into it cause he was a osteoarthritis arthritis, our brother mad dog, he fell into it because he was animal.

Speaker 3:          01:57:07       He just, he was always that guy. Yeah, he was, you know, the guy who's like the king of the school ahead of everything. That was mad dog. He was always, you know, always in charge. Always had the most friends, was super popular, you know. But there was something, some void inside, something missing that would turn them to drugs and alcohol. Man. It's like when you know someone that has that, it is such a helpless feeling because there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it. I first experienced it when I was in high school. Um, my dad was an architect and a, I got a lot of gigs over the summer working on construction sites and so I would hang out with a lot of these guys that were carpenters and laborers and this one guy that I've worked with is a great guy, but he couldn't fucking lay off the coke.

Speaker 3:          01:57:51       Yeah, couldn't, he would get clean. He was like, this is it. I'm getting my band together. I'd be like, that's awesome man. Good for you. And then he would come in, hung over, fucked up like it just looks like he had the flu and it's dark. It's dark and it's dark and stop. You keep going back to it. I used to go in my bathroom in the morning hungover every day, look in the mirror and go, who the fuck are you? Like what is that fat gross wrinkly old dude doing in the mirror? Like what happened to you? You're, you're a movie was 96% on rotten tomatoes about, about steroids and, and health and, and trying to figure out if this is good or bad for you and now you're just a fucked up drug addict. And I would just cry. And I had nothing like nowhere to turn. I felt like I couldn't tell my parents because they just experienced it. I felt like I couldn't tell my brother cause he's in the fitness and training and he's going to be like,

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       come on dude, snap out of it. You know how that's possible. It's what I, it's what I thought. But what I thought didn't happen as soon as mark found out about it, he said, come here, give me a big hug and say, well, we're going to help you. You know? And, and I think that's most people's fear is that it's going to be really bad. But I should tell everybody it's going to be really, really good when you come out. That other side of wife was a big part of it and the advice I always give and we try to always give is just don't give up on people. You can't, you, you don't want to overextend yourself because you are going to get fucked over by people that are addicts. You will get screwed over. Um, but you just tell him, hey, whenever you're ready, I'm here to help.

Speaker 2:          01:59:15       Whatever way I can help. If I can help financially, if I can help, uh, you know, whatever way I can help, I'm here to help. Just let them know. And then that way you can always at least feel good that you, you at least did some of your part there in with him, my wife was like, we got to get him the hell out of Los Angeles. We live in Sacramento. She's like, we got to get them up here. So we flew him up just so you can keep an eye on them. Not that Sacramento is not without its temptation. That's a hundred, a hundred percent. Just a not be on his own was the main thing is he doesn't have any family down here and stuff. And so we did that and took him under is under our wing and um, you know, got him lifting and the Diet.

Speaker 2:          01:59:48       I think everything, I think everything helped get them to where he is now. I'm so proud of him. It's unbelievable. The sounds kind of Dorky, you know, in some way. Cause he's my bro folks. We're supposed to talk shit about each other all the time, you know, but I am really proud of him and he's been an idol of mine sent, you know, since I was a little kid. He's the reason why I lift. He's in reason why I laughed so hard and he'll get motivated by me and he'll say, dude, I saw you doing that crazy shit. He's like, I'm going to go in and dead lift. But it's really him that's motivating me. He's the driver of a lot of this. Well, um, you've, you really do look a lot healthier than when I first, I think it looks, it's fucking awesome. Thanks for both.

Speaker 2:          02:00:24       I'm getting showered and prays over while I was like, you look good man. Thank you man. I really appreciate it. Someone you see them, they just look vibrant. You know, you can tell when someone's healthy. That's all. I first started getting sober. It was hard, you know, he, he was losing weight, he was doing everything, you know, he's doing everything good, but he still was getting sick all the time and he looked sickly, you know, and I was like, man, is he, is he telling me the truth? Is He really doing okay? And it took time. It took a long time. The best thing for me is being able to give back and um, being able to come on this podcast and I know after this podcast I'm going to hit, get hit up on social media a million times and it'd be like, Bro, I'm dying.

Speaker 2:          02:01:01       I'm sick. I'm drunk right now. I'm crying and I'll, and be like, call me. You know what I mean? I'll call these people. That's awesome. I literally called them and they say, I can't even believe I'm talking to you. And I'm like, I'm just a normal dude, you know, trick of the microphone. Right? Yeah. And, and so what's really beautiful is being able to help these people. And then, you know, forgetting about these people because there's so many of them. There's hundreds of emails and texts and things at porn. So you, you, uh, you help them and then you move on to the next guy. But then three or four months later you get this, you know, thank you letter. You know that that says like, Hey, I completely turned my life around. I'm

Speaker 1:          02:01:39       completely fine now. You know what? I'm sure some of them still go the other way and you can't save everybody and yeah, you can't help everybody, but you sure can try, you know,

Speaker 4:          02:01:48       well, you definitely make an impact and podcasts like this always make an impact. There's people out there that are listening right now and they might be in their car, they might be sitting at home just trying to figure out what the fuck to do with their life. Sometimes all people need is that little extra juice, that little extra motivation that they get from here. Somebody like yourself that's gone through it and came out on the other side healthy and you're like, fuck. If he was crying, looking in the mirror and feeling like shit, and he was addicted to drugs and, and, and, and he came from a healthy background and he came from a background where he's making a documentary about health.

Speaker 1:          02:02:17       When it got really bad, um, you know, when, when you start drinking in the morning, it's really bad. And, uh, alcohol became the worst part of it. Worse than worse than even the pills. And I just remember, and they start selling alcohol in La at 6:00 AM. And I remember I used to live right across from Gold's gym in Venice. And I get up and I walk across the street at like five 45 because my car was parked. I had to park across the street right by the gym. I walk across the street over by the gym and I'd see my friends going into the gym for a workout and they'd be like, Hey Chris, what's going on? You know, I, but be waving them. I'd be going to the liquor store. And that's when I knew it was like really bad things needed to change. So, you know, I, I really do think that, like you said, um, it takes somebody just like that little thing. So if there's people out there that are listening to this, just hit me up or hit up somebody and tell them that you're hurting because people will help you. You need other people.

Speaker 4:          02:03:10       Well, you're not going to do it on your own. Everybody needs other people, period. That's this idea of the lone wolf is total here.

Speaker 1:          02:03:16       I need the help other people in order for me to be fulfilled for sure. You know, so, yeah. Yeah. I mean, we're all, we're all together in this thing. Yeah. When having him at, at my house, you know, really helped me a lot too. Just just knowing that he was safe and knowing he was doing the right thing. I'm married, I've got two kids. I don't fuck around. I train, I fucking eat, try to eat healthy. I try to do the best I can each and every day. And having him with me made me more accountable. It made me more, you know, more full bore about everything. So it worked out good for both of us. Did you ever investigate Ibogaine? Yeah, I looked into it. I talked to the top. I knew, I do know the top a researcher on Ibogaine, a doctor, Deborah Mash.

Speaker 1:          02:03:55       Explain what that stuff is and what it can do. Ibogaine is a substance that you get it from Africa, found an Africa and basically you can you drink it. I think they make up some sort of potion or whatever and you drink it. And then literally what to turn a 20 year heroin addict around in about a day, about 36 hours they say. And they, they go through some ritual. I'm not sure if the ritual does anything. Uh, the doctor didn't even really know if the ritual does data anything, but it's part of the, a placebo I guess. But it seems to really work. It's a schedule one drug here in America. You can't get it here. Uh, it's, it's actually fairly safe compared to a lot of other things. So there's been some deaths it, but it like maybe

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       15 all time or something like not, not super high and it definitely needs to be medically supervised, but I don't think it should be illegal in all. I think it should be. I think Ibogaine and Kratom or the answers to the opioid epidemic, well, I began, has an incredibly high rate of success in terms of like people taking nine began getting off pills. I think Ibogaine is incredible. I think Ed Clay, uh, opened up a clinic. He went down, he had a issue with pills as well and I'm pretty sure, I don't want to speak out of school, but I'm pretty sure his came also from an injury and then he got a, had a pill problem and then was trying to figure out what the fuck to do with it and went down to Mexico, went to an Ibogaine clinic and then said, wow, this is fixed him up.

Speaker 3:          02:05:21       Totally. And then, uh, opened up his own clinic. That's awesome. One thing I didn't understand is I interviewed this doctor Deborah Mash, and it's probably because she's in Florida, she's tied in with politicians, which is always a problem. And so she's 100% for Ibogaine, but she's also against Kratom, which makes no sense because she thinks that, uh, you know, Kratom is a, you know, because I will gain, you have to go get it medically supervising, medically done. And She just thinks like giving people Kratom is a loosey Goosey kind of stuff, man. I'm 100% for clinics opening up and then giving them under the doctors and give the money to the state. If you can get Ibogaine to the hands of a lot of these people, it's so ruthlessly introspective. Not from my personal experience, but arbors taken it. I know several people who had taken it.

Speaker 3:          02:06:09       I know several people that have taken it and it's completely turned their life around where they had this intense 24 hour experience where you just examine every single aspect of your life and this really alien way. And then after it's over, you're like, I am never fucking drinking again. Or I'm never taken dance again. And they really do change their life. And it's also not just an introspective experience, but it also rewires the way your brain handles the addiction. I'm not qualified to speak how, cause I don't really understand it. I don't, I don't know if anybody understands it. Actually we could explain it. Aubrey can explain the mechanism. There's of some sort of a shift. See if we could find that. How does Ibogaine cure addiction? So if you could find that, but it's incredibly effective. I mean, I wash it highest rates of, of a success.

Speaker 3:          02:06:57       Another super high rate of success that we might be getting in California. It's on the ballot in 2018 is legalizing psilocybin. If they gonna legalize silicide been, that can fix a lot of fucking people too. And that's also something that you don't die from. Nobody. Nobody's overdosing on psilocybin. The ld 50 rate is something like 1500. What does that, what does that do? What does it, what does the magic mushrooms, yeah. And, and that's for, um, mental health, right? Fermentable Johns Hopkins University did some studies on it and one of the things they found his soldiers with ptsd. This is one thing that maps is concentrating on now, especially soldiers with ptsd and anybody with Ptsd, rape victims of a violent assault victims. You know, some people have some real hard time getting past past events and um, psilocybin has incredible effects on that, but Mtma also does and right now maps is involved in some pretty heavy clinical trials with Mtma.

Speaker 3:          02:07:52       And um, they're, they think 2021 is around the time where they're going to have mtma clinics and then it'll be legal because we have so many soldiers that are coming back from war and they're all fucked up and they have no solutions and put these people on pills and antidepressants and all these different things, anti anxiety medication, psilocybin and MDM may have shown to have massive, powerful, beneficial effects. That's something that I really want to do. I want to do the MDM a treatment I think that, um, would a lot of people don't understand is when you have an addiction, there's like these, there's deep seated things in your, in your mind and your subconscious that drive you to go to the pills or go to the drinks or whatever. And it doesn't just go away when you get sober. You sort of work a lot of it out.

Speaker 3:          02:08:34       But some of the subconscious stuff you can't work out. So I'm like, man, there's, there's still things, habits I don't like about myself. There's still things I want to fix. And I let me connect you to Aubrey because he loves it. Yeah. He's really tight with those guys that are in the middle of those studies right now. And he's actually gone through that protocol and then operate a little bit. Yeah. Do you have his number? Let me contact him and talk to him about it because he's, he's deep in this stuff. You know, Ombre who's introduced me to him when I went down to your gym on a gym? Yeah. He's a, what I would call real psychedelic warrior. And he's in there, he's in there all the time and with some crazy shit, you know, but there's the real benefits from it. I mean, real legit benefits.

Speaker 3:          02:09:13       And we've been, we've been really robbed and it's, it's terrible. I mean, we've been lied to. We've been robbed and there's a lot of people that use them recreationally. And I'm not against that, you know? I mean, I think you should be able do whatever the fuck you want. If you can drink whiskey recreationally, which I do, I don't think there's anything wrong with doing mushrooms recreationally. And there's some people that think it's terrible and you should, there are a sacrament. We still use them in a ritual and a shamonic setting. I say, you should do that too if you want. But I've used it recreationally. I've had a great old fucking time and also came out of it with some insight and some, a different way of looking at myself and looking at my life. Do you know that, um, in this country you have to list euphoria as a side effect to a supplement or a drug wrestle area.

Speaker 3:          02:09:56       So euphoria is something that we all should have. Like we should all be happy, right? So they're listed as a side effect as if it's a bad thing they experienced you for ya. Oh Shit, I better not take that right. Super fucking habit. And don't you think the things that induce euphoria we should be, we should be handing those out like crazy. People are too angry. He thinks these pills or maybe like rehab pills kind of in a way like almost like treatment pills because they help you, you know, look from the inside out almost. Well for sure with MDA, which you get in pill form, it's actually made from the bark of a tree from, didn't we go over this the other day where the fucks are from Malaysia or some shit, something like that. There's a tree and that there's a real issue

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       now, uh, in this country where this bark is, because you know, this fucking wars going on to try to get this tree and it's not a very common tree either. It's like, I mean, it's rare. And we were, we could be in a situation where they chopped down all the fucking trees that make ecstasy before we make it legal. They did it with Kratom in Thailand. So Thailand made kratom illegal because it was cutting into the heroin, the heroin trade, this is back in 1947. They made it illegal and cut down almost all the Kratom trees. And if you see the documentary that um, uh, the guy did on Vice Morris Hamilton Morrison was, yeah, he did the Pharmacopoeia. Yeah. Shell on Kratom and he goes to Thailand to find like the only remaining Kratom tree. And he like, he finds it and wow drinks the real kratom and all stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          02:11:19       It was really kind of fascinating that they, that they did that. So now it all comes from like, you know, Malaysia, Indonesia, whenever it is crazy that they tried to stop the one thing that's safe because it was cutting into the fucking opium market. Yeah, of course. I like crate them too. I use it before I work out a lot of times. You really? Yeah. And even just for creativity, just like if I want to just sit down and write or think of new products or whatever, it might be one, two in that way. How so? I like it a lot. Um, I don't know exactly what it does. I don't know what the mechanism is behind it, but it does give me a sense of euphoria. It does make me happier. One thing I've always noticed about training is that when you feel good, um, you can lift so much better and it just makes you, makes you feel really great because you know you're trying, you're trying to lift with some force, just like you hitting these bags and stuff, you're trying to put something into it.

Speaker 2:          02:12:08       And if you can't put the mustard on it that you want to cause your shoulder hurts, I can make you grumpy. But this stuff really matters to us. So for me, for for lifting wise, it's like I feel like I can go all in. I was actually just saying the other day when I'm sitting down and I go to get up, especially after some of these like squat workouts and stuff, it's kind of slow. He takes me, takes me a minute, but on Kratom boom, I feel like I can get up and run out the door. It feels like almost, I would see, I would consider it similar to the getting out of a hot tub with you feel going into the hot tub. You're like, man, my shit is just kind of, I don't even know. Everything's just stiff. Right. Can't get up and down the stairs so good.

Speaker 2:          02:12:42       I got to do the sideways a trot down the stairs every morning and I get in the hot tub and I can zing up the stairs naked picture that sometimes I have pain in my hip when I don't run hills, they don't sense men and I've talked to doctors and they don't understand it. I say, look, when I run hills every day or not every day, every week I run like two, three times a week. I got zero pain in that hip. Could just be getting a lot of blood, not in the hip flexor. I think running hills and running, uh, running in sand I think is really, really valuable. Even pushing sleds and stuff because it slows us down, not that running is running can be great sprints can be great, but regular sprints for some of us who are over 40 and you haven't sprinted in a long time, probably not a great idea but to run up a hill or to sprint up a hill, it makes you go slower because the intensity is higher

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       and it doesn't seem it's, well I think that's it but it's also, I'm putting all this extra muscle around my hip and my ass like there's something about that's great, thank you very much. But it's something about running up hills that like, dude, I take a couple of weeks off, like I was sick for a week and then the week before that I was doing a lot of other different shit and I didn't and it starts to like get at me reverse hyper doesn't help with that. Would that would make him a hip. It's going to front of the hip side to side on that is you've got to get in on that hip circle. Hip Circle. What's a show yet? Oh, band. Yeah, the hip Ben. Yeah. Yeah. Those are great. It'll help you that help build up that side ass. I like to call. Is that what it is? I'm telling you man, there's nothing like running up hills and the hills that I run, it's all rocky terrain.

Speaker 3:          02:14:18       Some jumping from one rock to the next and it's steep like that. So I'm running up and um, you know, I have to take a couple of breaks to get to the top. It's a half a mile up, a half a mile in. I have two different courses that I run. Um, well they have several, but the ones that I run the most, the full length of it, I could, I could run as long as four miles or I could do, I could break it up into one or two. Most of the time I do too. How long are you runs? Two hours, uh, to a miles takes me about 40 minutes because the hills, it's not two hours. I mean, it's not 40 minutes. I could run it, probably do it. It's 15, 16. If I was running flat, you know, I wouldn't be that hard. But it's hills. Um, it's not really, I mean I would call it running, but it's more like hill sprints.

Speaker 3:          02:15:06       I'm just doing these roots was hill sprints and I've read that a long time ago that a lot of football players prefer a hill sprints. And then I saw that, um, um, Greg Jackson and Mike Winkeljohn when they train their fighters now, but Kirky they have them run this crazy mountain and they run it and run straight up the hill. And that this was like a pig thing that they did to, to really build up. And Darren and Walter Payton, Roger Craig, this goes on and on with Damian Thompson. Uh, Walter Peyton used to run hills till he throw up. Yeah, he threw up. I think I'm running hills is great, especially for bigger guys. Guys that are two 50 to 60 to 70 have joint problems. It's going to be really hard to get out there and run. Yeah. Cause you're not, it's not a pounding, you're not dropping the weight down.

Speaker 3:          02:15:48       Instead you're like, you're almost doing like lunges like over and over and over again. Right. And you could walk back down the hill, you know, take your time. You can walk back down the hill. There's evidence that shows if you do five to eight sprints and you have long periods, you can have as much rest as you want between, you'll still get great results for fat burning. So yeah, he doesn't take very long to do a workout like that. It changes your cardio too. I mean, it really does force him to do shit like that with me sometimes. But can you, you can't run though, right? With your bad hand. Not really run by pushing, pushing a sled is really hard. He has a thing called the tank, which is a kind of an amazing, a sled with wheels. Oh, you're pushing, you put weights on it. So we pushed the tank. We do all sorts of stuff like that that,

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       um, are different. Like, I can go on a rowing machine as fast as possible. I can go on a, um, the, uh, what do you call it? The aerodyne bike as fast as possible. The echo bike rogue. It's a fucking tank. It's like an Airdyne on steroids. It's got these big ass fucking handles and that it looks nice. It's so good. It's so good. Plus to something as simple as that and, and those bikes that you can get them as cheap as like 500 bucks. Yeah. I think it'll change your life. Just like mark said, five to eight sprints on it a day. Yeah. It's completely, when he comes up and trained with me, when he comes up and trains with me, a lot of times he'll say, I can't do that. I try to, you know how everybody in these kind of big circuits that we do and we, we train our asses off and probably sometimes overdo it, but when he joins us, a lot of times they'll say, I can't do this or I can't do that.

Speaker 1:          02:17:19       I'm like, well, you don't really know unless you try it. And I, I'm sympathetic towards fake hips. I don't have them, so I don't know exactly what it's like, but I'm like, just try it or try a different variation of it. And He, he kind of won't. And then he'll kind of drift off and the next minute I'll see him, I'll see him either trying it or trying or doing some other version of it. And I'm like, all right, good. It's working cause he's at least doing something. Right. Do you fuck with the versaclimber? Yeah, we do that a little bit sometimes. Stoughton's hate your life. We do a circuit with that. And I have a bike that's on steroids to, oh sh so from Australia, I forget what the theme at the end please. Our two. Oh yeah. We have the uh, uh, ski Erg thing.

Speaker 1:          02:17:58       Oh those things are ruthless. We use that and the rower and we do a circuit of all, like all three or four of those exercises. Yeah. That's fucking awesome. I got, when I started editing it, adding in a lot more things like that and cardio and stuff like that because, uh, I'm 45. He's, how old are you? 41 40. [inaudible] so as we get older, you start looking into things where, uh, you want to be healthy, you know, I want to do it for your health. So I'm thinking about those things. A, we definitely, I don't care about power lifting anymore. I don't care about my numbers. I want to lift heavy weights consistently, but I don't care what the single rep maxes anymore. It doesn't matter. You know? Um, when you talk about your diet and its impact on inflammation, do you ever think that if you got on this diet when you were younger, you wouldn't have had to get hip replacements?

Speaker 1:          02:18:42       Yeah, I do. I really do. I think if I did when I was younger, um, well, I don't know. You know, it's about a, it really is about a decline and I'm in tissue, you know, he'd decline in cartilage tissue, like where it was there when I was young and then it started disappearing. And then by the time I was 28 years old, it was completely gone. And this is because of inflammation and because of arthritis, there's really no reason for it. You know, my doctor said that lifting didn't cause it. It might have sped it up. The fact that I needed to get the double hip replacement surgery, but he said like this isn't something that, you know, lifting a weight causes like a natural process in your body where you're, your body's breaking down, you know, whatever. So I don't, I don't know a good test will five years from now how I feel, you know, because I have other joints in my body, a lot of them.

Speaker 1:          02:19:32       I was just going to ask you like, how are your shoulders? How are your, well, I screwed up my shoulder and I tore my rotator cuff and I tore my tricep a while back and they never really heal, healed properly, so that, that's an issue. Um, but the rest of my other joints that aren't, are injured are all fine and feel good now. You know? So what about your needs? Well, my knees were when I had got my hip surgery 10 years ago. Uh, the doctor said to me, your knees are next and they need to be done probably like in a year. God, so he told me that when 10 years ago he's got a Ferrari and I'm making payments on that Condo in the Alps and uh, I don't know. I haven't had, and then, um, let's see, I'm trying to think of when this was.

Speaker 1:          02:20:15       I think like around when I finished prescription thugs, so maybe like two years ago, uh, I was, I went to a doctor and I was just in so much pain and I said, look, I can't get back on opioids. That was, that was my problem, but I need something. What was the pain in everywhere. Every joint in my lower body from my, like my ankles, my knees, my hips, and the guy basically just said, you need to go get a full body MRI. So I get a full body Mri and he tells me that there's really nothing wrong with me. And I'm like, I don't know what you're looking at, but I can't walk in the morning. And he's like, ah, well you don't, you don't really have, you know, like you're, you don't really have cartilage in your knees that's going away, but like, you know, you do have it in your ankles and you do have, and didn't really offer me any solutions.

Speaker 1:          02:20:57       And then that was, it was at that point where I realized like, if I'm going to do anything, a doctor's not going to be the one to help me, you know? So I think a lot of times people are always so concerned, like, did you ask a doctor? And I'm always like, with doctors never really helped me. You know, it's my cell phone. He's helping me. It's me researching things that caused me pain, that, that really helped me, you know? So, um, that's, that's what I had to do was go out and look for it myself. Wow. So when you, do you ever go back to that doctor and go, hey motherfucker, it's 10 years later, I'm still walking and now I don't have any pain. I should go back to him and say, hey, you know, like they, you know, they screwed up my hip and they left.

Speaker 1:          02:21:34       They left a bad hip and me for two years. And then I went to the doctor and I went to my doctor and I said, doc, this is debilitating. And so he takes a, a tissue box and he throws it on the ground and he says, pick that up. And I pick it up. And he said, you're using the wrong terminology. It's not debilitating. I'll see. You wouldn't be able to pick that up. And I thought it was the rudest thing I've ever heard a doctor do or say like ruthless, like really? So I'm using the wrong word, but big. I can't, I can't pick something up off the floor. It hurts. And I was trying to tell him like, you don't understand this hurts. And he's like, Nah, you're not hurt, you're fine. He actually told me to go back to the gym and start lifting. Oh my God. And then two years later he calls me back and he says, I know what's wrong with your hip. We screwed it up. Oh Jesus. Yeah. So it's everything about column on that doctors on late night TV. Yeah. You know, think, I don't think that's the, you know, you don't get as a way to get paid, I'm

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       sure. Yeah. But they fucked you up man. Yeah. Just sue the shit out of that asshole tissue box. Throwing douchebag. Fuck them. Part of what happened to you too was like you had pain, right? That was a, that was preventing you from moving more, right? Like, and then you just kind of stopped. Like you did some cardio stuff for exercise, but you weren't able to squat, bench deadlift. You weren't able to get some full range of motion and therefore, you know, use it or lose it. Right. You lost range of motion. When did the pain go away? Uh, well, I'm still on a lot of pain when I wake up every morning. So yeah, it goes away when I, the thing is that the diet has helped clear up like a lot of inflammation. It's also helped clear up a lot of body fat, which helps you get in a better and more advantageous positions when you're lifting.

Speaker 2:          02:23:09       You know that you can't, I couldn't even bend down to dead lift properly. Egg got would get in a way and all that stuff like that. So, um, get rid of those things and that helps a lot. Losing weight in general always is going to improve health markers and you're always going to feel lighter and better, you know, for the most part. And then, um, it was that this like losing weight. And then when I, um, started taking Kratom with a ketogenetic diet and really reduce my inflammation is when I started feeling better. So was sort of a combination of those two things. And I'm continuing to move. It's a daily struggle. It doesn't go away. You know, this, this is because your osteoporosis osteoarthritis. So when you woke up this morning, what hard to get out of bed? Yeah. You know what? Actually, um, this morning I felt good.

Speaker 2:          02:23:54       So you have good days and bad days, you know? Did you ever fuck with hot yoga? I haven't, but I keep hearing you talk about it and I keep thinking like, man, that's just something I have to go do. I was wondering like how that would affect your hips. Like how you're like, do you have full range of motion? I think I would probably feel great but right now I can't move enough to get in those positions so I have to take like a pre yoga class to get into, you know, you just take a yoga class and you do your best. Like they always say that because there's a lot of people in my class that have some serious issues that can't move well or there's this one lady who goes and she's fucking courageous man cause this lady's so overweight and she goes this yoga class and she does her best and you know, I see her and I, I want to say something to her but I don't want to say something to her.

Speaker 2:          02:24:36       Like I don't want to be the guy and go, hey you know for a giant lady you're fucking putting it up there. Like I don't want to like, you know, you're right. I say hi and I smile at her, but she's courageous. She's every bit of 400 5,500 pounds. Wow. Just guessing. She is enormous, but she does it. She tries, she's, she's, you know, she's got her arms up. She's been in for it. She's doing her best. And if you just keep showing up, it'll get better. Like you're not going to be able to get into those positions initially, but if you keep showing up, I think the hot yoga might help him because, uh, when he's warmed up, you move around really well. That's what I'm sending work workout. You're like, oh fuck it. Now I'm going to dead lift once he's warmed up.

Speaker 2:          02:25:15       Yeah. A lot of people don't warm up enough. Right. I agree, man. You're 100% in a yoga class where it's already warm. That helps a lot. But you know, people need to understand that the more intense the exercise is that you're going to do, the longer your warm up needs to be. Yeah. So if you're going for a two hour walk, how much warm up do you need? Probably none. There's no one, there's not a lot of intensity behind that. But if you're trying to run a 40 meter sprints, then you better warm up for a half an hour and probably minimum. So you don't tear a hamstring. Same thing with trying to bench heavy or squat heavy, not just the exercise itself either. That's a mistake I think. I think you have to warm up on with other, with other means. And the easiest way to warm up is through your upper body.

Speaker 2:          02:25:54       So you go in the gym and you can do curls and shoulder stuff if your shoulders healthy. Uh, that's the fastest way. Skier is a great way. That's fastest, easiest way to warm up your body is through the upper body a lot of times are our needs. What do you mean? Well cause like your knees and your lower back. I mean just in general, this is an everybody but in general a lot of people, the knees, the lower back and some of those things are going to take time to warm up and you can warm up faster just by, just by getting the upper body to move. Uh, when you utilize your upper body, you get your heart rate up a little bit faster and it's just, it's more comfortable. It's just easier. It's easier for me to say, Hey, you know, hold this band, pull it apart, do these curls.

Speaker 2:          02:26:34       He just move your arms, throw some punches, like who can't throw punches. Right. Anyone can throw some punches. I know you guys can throw any good ones. Yeah, no, you can't do any good ones. Yeah, but you just, you move around. That's how you warm yourself up. You've got to make sure you warm yourself up. I get to use the elliptical machine. I do 10 minutes on an elliptical machine. Absolutely nothing going on as the intensity, so low and there's no impact, no nothing. You can do it at your own pace and not really caring. And mark and I do all the time is walk. We walk every single day. And um, we started a thing like a 10 minute, he does has a Hashtag 10 minute walk and uh, after, after you eat every time, right? Yeah. Yeah. You try to do as many 10 minute walks in the days it can.

Speaker 2:          02:27:15       Anybody about that Hashtag because now they're going to put a picture of a bunch of pictures of Dicks Hashtag [inaudible] hey, that's okay. Yeah, I get it. I get a lot of good balance plants. I don't know. Now it's even worse cause I said it here like some inside joke about eggplants, tons of eggplants, eggplants a Dick, right? What kinds of things, right? Yeah, for sure. 100% yeah. Oh I didn't know. Yeah. Oh now you're getting lockers. That's, it's so funny. I'm so, I'm so old. I don't know anything the kids are doing these days. I just found out about a little bee. I don't know shit. Anyway, people should be going on a 10 minute walk. It's low hanging fruit. It's easy to do. Just try one a day. It's not hard. One thing I like to do is body weight squats. To do those Hindu squats, I'll do a set of a hundred and it just gets everything warmed up. Everything League, get your legs burning pretty bad in a weird spot, right? Like your quads near your knee. Upper knee? Yeah. Like right here. Yeah. This, this part like right where your need connects. Where your quad, that handy spot. What about, what about a wall? Sit. How come a wall sit so hard? It's fucking hard.

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       I did that the other day. It was brutal. It was the hardest fucking exercise. There isn't, well, in karate they would have you stand at a horse stance for long periods of time. Just like this. Just standing at horse dance like how hard could this be? A minute and you're like, oh shit. How am I supposed to do this? You're not even leaning up against the wall. Yeah. No. Lean up against the wall. Just a deep squat to stand and how long we you standing for it? I never did it. It was not, my instructor was never ended up. Well I didn't. I took karate for a very short period of time. That's a karate thing. That was in taekwondo. He never did that. Karate kids coming back. Oh my God. You know about Ai. Is it a will smith junior again? No, no, it's Cobra Kai.

Speaker 3:          02:29:01       It's a show about the Cobra Kai. It's like Netflix that's about the bags and Netflix on youtube, but Ralph Machos in it and he comes in and he has a competing Dojo I believe. How old is Ralph Macho now? 50 30 to least he looks great. Like what does that guy on the trade show is on some youth shit. Oh, you just go look at Cobra Kai. Let me see the strike hard. Oh, pushups. Oh, terrible punches. It was teaching these people. No mercy. Is there any particular way you want me to shut them out with that? Shut that off right now. That was great. There you go. That is the fucking trailer we need an MMA movie. Get to, there was one warrior, Brian town was in that. The only problem with that movie is they had people fight over a couple of days, which is just like shut the fuck up.

Speaker 3:          02:29:54       They did a bunch of stupid shit. They didn't have to do in that movie. They just, you don't have people. You can have people fight more than a one time and the night. But if you really think someone can get in a bra and then you've never seen anybody fight and then see what they look like the next day. Cause I remember when Ken shamrock fought Tito Ortiz and then I ran into him the next day. I was like, Holy Shit can, his whole face was swollen up. He had sunglasses on it. If that guy is not fighting any today, you know, I mean he would, he's a fucking animal but that's not healthy. Like your body's dealing with all that. I don't even like when they fight more than one time in the night and they got away with that back in the day. And I know glory still does that for some of the kickboxing tournaments, but it's his fucking dangerous.

Speaker 3:          02:30:34       It's just not smart. Guys get concussed and then they fight again an hour later, two hours later. That's crazy. Smashing machine was a fucking awesome movie. That's my favorite documentary ever. That is my top and that's an accidental fine. That's when I was documentaries. Amazing Doc. That is a lot like that movie icarus where they started to do one thing and then a long yeah, they found something way fucking crazy. Yeah. And that's uh, a documentary around Mark Kerr who was one of the scariest mma fighters of all time and he was Jews to the, but there was such an ironic thing with him where he was an animal, but he was so afraid to actually fight, which was really cool. Where that, that was such an interesting angle you'd say before he goes out to the cage every time he's like, I can barely take a sip of water because I'm so nervous because that kills people.

Speaker 3:          02:31:26       I was around when Mark Kerr first started competing. He's one of the first guys that ever saw, first of all, he was a gi and they used to call him the specimen for a while. Then they called them the smashing machine. But uh, he's the first guy that ever saw that submitted someone with a look of that shit the fuck out of here. That's crazy. It's like, I can improve that. Um, but look at that. Just keep that up there for a second. And those traps when he was a, that's pretty at the UFC, he submitted someone with a chin to the eye socket. He held the back of the dude's head and got his chin and the guy's eye socket and you're fucking drove his chin into his eye socket Dan [inaudible]. Yeah, first time I ever saw somebody submit someone that way. But seriously everybody asks me what my favorite documentary is cause that's what I do.

Speaker 3:          02:32:10       And without even hesitation, I always say smashing machine. It's a great documentary on so many levels. It really reminded me of our older brother. He reminded me a lot of mad dog. Wow. Mark her. Well you know he had a substance abuse problem and he was also like a guy at the time. It was the early days of MMA. I mean he was fighting back when it was just crazy raw bare knuckles and you know, fighting in these weird rings and Shammy and he was the early, early days of MMA. You ever read the book blood in the cage? I read some of it's really good. I never feel like you had pat on a last week and actually wanted to do, I still want to do a film with Pat, a scripted film. We had been talking about it, we talked about it a long time ago and now I'm starting started, started adding a little bit of clout.

Speaker 3:          02:32:55       Now I'm starting to talk about it again, but his life was insane. He had two brothers that died and one brother that ended up going to jail for like 15 years and he was the runt of the family and he ended up becoming the first ever UFC lightweight champion, which is just overcoming adversity like crazy. It's an amazing story. You know, pats neck was so fucked up that his discs fuse together on their own. Wow. That's incredible. It's so much degeneration of his disks that the two bones, they sat on top of each other for so long that they fused the port where people accused him of having an operation. Like he had an issue where a doctor said that he had an operations. I never had a fucking operation like your neck, your fucking boone's the two bones. They have no disc in the middle, another fuse together.

Speaker 3:          02:33:41       I've never even heard of that before. You ever heard of that before? No. Fucking tough. You have to be to deal with kind of pain where your neck is fusing itself. Your neck is like, this asshole is not going to go to a doctor, so we're going to be the doctor. When you see what he went through a, he's probably one of the toughest people and the world, you know, just that. She's been through a lot of very smart dude too. He's talked to him. He's there, he's all there. I mean long career in mma, you know, he fought Dan Severn finished a book. If you get a chance, it's amazing. Okay. Listen to the audio book when you run or something. That's great. Really good book. Um, yeah, he's, it's those old days. There's nothing like them. Never happened again. What's great about that book. Also,

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       it tells the whole story of the, how the UFC started, how it got us started and all the players involved. And it tells that whole story, which is really putting a Jon Wertheim sports illustrated, really, really good writer. That guy has written a lot of good stuff. He wrote a great book on pool too. Yeah, he wrote a book on delicious. He brought the pool book. He wrote a book on statistics and how they sort of a point shave and all that stuff on that in basketball. No, he's a, he's a very good writer. Okay, cool. Uh, when is, uh, do you think this documentary is gonna come out the new [inaudible]? Well, the creative ones gonna come out soon, right? Eight 29 and then what's it going to be on? How's it, where can people get it? Well, hopefully it will be on like Netflix, Amazon, whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:34:59       I'm not sure exactly where it will be yet. We've partnered with the orchard and there's the distribution companies. So right now they're in the process of figuring out where it will be. Um, but I'll let everybody know. It'll be on it. Probably start out to tell you the truth on itunes, the normal route. And then, um, you know, you let it play on itunes for a while and hey, there's a, there's a whole system to it because it makes money in different ways, different places. Right. Unfortunately for documentary film makers, Netflix is sort of your, that's your graveyard at the end because you know, like you want it to be on Netflix because everybody has access to it. And as a film maker, they really shaft you can because they'll buy the like, so they buy the film from the distribution company and then like all that money just goes back to the investor and then, and it's like, I don't get, I don't see any money out of it.

Speaker 1:          02:35:47       So the only way to make documentaries and make them profitable and make them really, really cheap. And a lot of times we don't do that, so we ended up, you end up losing some money on it a lot of times, you know, the way it's just the way it works. This nutrition movie. Yeah. Find that millionaire money. That's 100%. Yeah. But you know, the advantage of doing a food documentaries, they do really well. So it would a food documentary, you have a chance to really make a profit. Where as the other stuff it's, it's really difficult. Did you gotten the term meathead billionaire yet? A trademark. Yeah. Did you I got all kinds of stupid shit. Trademarks. That's a good thing. That's a good thing. That was my nickname for him had millionaire. Well I know that, uh, it grows, did really well and it did really well.

Speaker 1:          02:36:28       Bryan Fogel, you know, but that is a groundbreaking boss life changing documentary. Also things break out like that. Like that might be, first of all, it was involved, you know, when we did bigger, stronger, faster, there wasn't an international scandal going on right. That we were sorta happened to be following. And so, yeah. So, so, um, in a way, you know, he got, he got lucky with that, but he also made a great film. He took it and made it into something really good. So I think that was cool. But, uh, you know, it, it was what a crazy movie that was. You know, we didn't, we didn't have something like that in the movie. We didn't have somebody like admitting to steroids that was like huge. So, uh, when it came out at Sundance, it was sort of a shocker to a lot of people like, this is at Sundance. This is crazy. I can't believe this, you know, at Sundance. And um, and it did really well. It got really good reviews. It did really well,

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       but it didn't have that like one thing that broke it out and made it super size me, you know, there was, there was something missing, some element where every, you know, it wasn't a thing that everybody had to see. Although it was a really great film, I think, you know, it just didn't have that one thing that was really great as well. But yeah, you didn't, he got super lucky while he was doing, you know, you could see what I'm saying now. It wasn't that one thing. We had to see it because of this thing, you know? It's like, yeah, because there's always the thing about cheating in the Olympic Games, it's always been suspected, but to get it so confirmed where you have the guy that did it and he's running from the Russian mob or the whatever you want to call them, and they're trying to fucking kill him.

Speaker 3:          02:37:52       It was, no, he's in hiding. He's still in hiding to this day in America in protective custody. And they're looking for him. Yeah, they're looking for him. I think it's crazy. I think it's crazy. First of all that he did, did the film and I think secondly, it's crazy that, um, he wasn't even a little bit more protected in the least by the film maker. I thought the film maker kind of throw him under the bus a little bit, but that's just how so are you wanted to be in the film? Yeah, I know. It was, it was weird though. It started to feel weird. I felt like, um, I dunno. I mean like the daddy of protected by changing is named that the Russians knew who he was. Yeah. I, I don't know. I just, I just felt like it was, um, I dunno.

Speaker 3:          02:38:32       I felt like it was a little reckless as a filmmaker, you know, I just felt like it was a, what would you do differently? It's tell you the truth. I really, I really don't know what I would do differently. I just felt like, man, this like as I'm watching it going like, man, this guy's going to get in a lot of trouble. He's going to get killed because of this. He threw me in so I don't, I don't know. Maybe I did. I don't know. Maybe I do. Maybe I'm just talking out my ass. But you weren't like rigging the Olympics. But what changed after that was that the Russians essentially are barred from the Olympics and now they compete in the Olympic final. What's interesting is we, they had don Catlin in there and Don Catlin guy for America that does the same thing. Does he?

Speaker 3:          02:39:09       And he was gonna, he was gonna be the first guy I remember. Then he backed out and he said, I'll give you the Russian guy. Cause he knew the Russian guy, he taught does it for America. He, he's the guy that's our doping control. Like he are doping control guy. He's our, our um, what, you saw a guy or he, he's a guy that did all the drug test for the Olympics from like the eighties on. But he's not the guy that dopes up the American Nazi doesn't really clearly he doesn't dope them up. He's the guy that tests them. We should tell people what ecourses too if they don't know what we're talking about. So this would be a standalone podcast. It's documentary that Bryan Fogel made where he decided to rice rice a ride his bike in a race. So clean, completely clean, and then do it on steroids to see what his times would be, how much, how much benefit it would have. And in the process of him filming this documentary, the guy who hooked him up, this guy, gregory from Russia, who was the head unbeknownst to him of the Russian state sponsored doping program, he was like, he thought he was getting a guy who was like the rush and you saw that, that it was going to tell him what

Speaker 1:          02:40:13       the cheaters use. But it turned out along the way, everything got exposed and he was like, look, I did this for 40 years. I dope everybody, everybody on drugs. And like he said, every fucking single athlete that was in the Olympics was on some shit. And then he explained how they did it and everybody's like, what the fuck? And then they were going to pull the Russians. And then the other thing that he exposed is the, the collusion between water and the IOC and that they all work for each other and they switched fucking rolls and they go back and forth to each other and that they're not going to punish the Russians and that. But what they're doing now is they kind of have to, because all of that movie, I mean that movie literally changed the Olympics. I guess what I'm saying is when I did bigger, stronger, faster, and we're going around and talking to the experts, you know, a lot of the experts, they would mention gone catlin.

Speaker 1:          02:41:01       I'd be like, what's up with Don Catlin? And they'd say, Oh man, if you get him to talk, I mean the sports world will just crumble. And everybody kept saying it like, I heard it from like four to people. How, sorry, experts. They just said like nobody would believe in sports if that guy expose what he knew. And so then I interviewed Don Catlin, but he just laughed when I asked him. And he's like, God, they don't know what they're talking about, you know, kind of thing. And you're to know, I'll see you guys later. And I said, well, look, Charles East St Louis is an expert. He said, the whole sports will crumble if they, if they knew what you knew, what do you know? And he said, I don't know anything. And so you're not, you're never going to get an answer like that. Something has to get exposed through a different way.

Speaker 1:          02:41:38       So I shouldn't, I can't say without a ship, without a shadow, beyond a shadow of a doubt that that's the truth. But I suspicious of that guy, I should say, and suspicious of our system. I don't think they're the only ones doing it. There's no way that the only ones doing that China had a record number of gold medals when they hosted it. We're doing it just as bad as they are. I wonder, I mean, we're doing it better. Obviously we're not, we're not getting caught. But I mean, so when you say we as a country state sponsored a marrow, no, no, no, no program. I don't think state sponsored. But I'd think like maybe some people doing something somewhere. There's some sort of network, some shenanigans. There's one balco there's 10. There's gotta be more than one bowel. Yeah, I think so. There's gotta be more than one guy that's like telling people what to take.

Speaker 1:          02:42:27       A lot of that shit out there. But listen, man, keep me posted on your movie. Let us know when, when this nutrition, do you have a name for it yet? Uh, we've been, we've been talking about on carbs. So you're talking about the war cars with, we've been debating whether or not that's the right, it's a very catchy things, especially now because people are so aware. There's so many people that are switching to low carb, high fat diets and having some pretty spectacular results. Yeah. I mean there's a lot of, there's a lot of evidence behind it. You know, and if you, you were saying before, I'd like to see somebody take all these diets and compare them. And they did that in the 70s or the 80s, I forget when it was. It was Dr. Gardner from Stanford and he was a vegetarian, so he took a Vegan diet, vegetarian diet.

Speaker 1:          02:43:08       The Atkins Diet was the Diet at the time. It wasn't like a Keto Diet, um, the dash diet and the ornish diet. And He'd put them all together and they did a lot, like a pretty big elaborate, I don't know how big it was. So, I don't want to say, but they're pretty elaborate study. And at the end of the day, the Atkins Diet, basically one most weight loss, best health marker improvement, Atkins Diet, and the guy who was a vegetarian and he said at the end of the study, this was a really tough pill to swallow. You know, and I think that's a really interesting thing. They did this study.

Speaker 4:          02:43:36       Did you know that Atkins had a bunch of heart attacks? Coronary heart disease is 258 pounds when he died. Yeah. And um, someone was saying, well heard that stuff wasn't true though. No, no, no, no. He was, no, he, that's how big he was when he died. And it definitely had heart disease. So it definitely did. But the question is, did he have heart disease before he did this diet was even on his own diet. I mean, was his diet based on science and fact and, and, and efficacy. But did he follow it or did he just eat ice cream?

Speaker 1:          02:44:07       Fuck off all day? We don't know. But he died by hitting his head. Right. It fell on his head.

Speaker 4:          02:44:11       Fell and hit his head. But see, this all came from a tweak that I read from John Joseph from the Cro mags, who's a pretty rampant, a rabid vegan and a bad ass, you know, triathlete and very, very athletic guy. Right. Um, he's, he is the one that said that and I was, oh wow. Is that true? And he said that the guy died of a heart attack and that his wife was covering it up. So I went to look into it and it's very difficult to say because, um, even snopes had as inconclusive. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, Ooh. Like he might have had a heart attack and fell and hit his head. It's, I mean the guy had heart disease, but the question is, look, some people have heart disease and it's congenital. They're born with issues and there is, there, there are people that are more, I mean, they're just more likely to have heart attacks, just like to some people that are more likely to have strokes and more likely to have arthritis. There's just issues that people have. So we don't know whether or not he was born with that. If he had that, but also if he's at 258 pounds, he clearly isn't following it's fucking diet unless he's a giant. Yeah. How old was he? He was an old guy and he's in his seventies, I believe. Maybe late sixties. Find it. Pull, pull, pull up the, um, the Wiki on him on, um, uh, Dr. Atkins. What was his name

Speaker 1:          02:45:29       from Robert? Robert Atkins. Robert Atkins. But you know how he died? Yeah, that's the thing. It was like, um, you were talking about him, the guy. Yeah. But the Diet that he created is different than the actual guy. Right. And we don't know if he was doing his diet. So we call that the people who were doing this diet that were in the study. Right. They ended up coming out on top as well. I'm saying the guy who created crossfit, he's not in shape. Right? I mean, you ever see him? Yeah. He, he's got some issues, I believe some injuries and stuff that don't allow him to do all this stuff to crossfit does. Right. But yeah, he's

Speaker 4:          02:46:01       [inaudible] 72 when he died, days prior to his death, he fell and hit his head and see New York pavement, a New York's blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Admitted April 8th he underwent surgery to remove a blood clot in his brain but went into a coma. So we don't know. I mean it says that's how he fell and he hit his head. We don't know why he fell and it may very well have been that, but here it says metal exam has offered her office a year after his death showed that Atkins had a history of heart attack. Can jet congestive heart failure? What does congestive heart failure and hypertension ingestive means. Okay, that's not good. His widow refuse to allow an autopsy. Oh that's interesting. That is interesting because does Wa widow refuse to allow an autopsy because this guy wasn't healthy and maybe wasn't even following his own advice, but he was, what was his weight when he died? Maybe cause it's going to say that Jamie, his wife might've felt that he's going to get ripped apart in his death and she didn't want that. Maybe 72 years old. You can find out what his weight was when he died. Cause I'm pretty sure he was 258 pounds and you're 258 pounds. It's 72 years old. That shit ain't good. You know, does it say is, wait, I'm very, very sure that he was very heavy.

Speaker 4:          02:47:19       Robert Atkins, 258 pounds when he died. I'm pretty sure that's how. So here's the thing, was that from the Diet, I mean it does. How's that possible? I mean if the guy's making people lose weight on this diet and he himself is fat and he himself has serious heart failure, 258 pounds, that is dell release report by New York City officials outrage the act and Atkins people. So he had a history of heart attacks and congestive heart failure and 258 pounds. Well I don't think he exercised. I think he probably didn't, but that doesn't mean anything. I mean the over eight obviously too, but it's like, was the guy following his own advice? We don't know. There's a lot of people that look, I think at this cream is tempting per spaghetti's tempting, you know, who doesn't like a good meatball sub every now and again? Who knows?

Speaker 4:          02:48:04       At the end of the day, we're all on this a race who can see who's going to live the longest. Right. And I there, I think that's, there's still no like real conclusive proof is there that one diet people can live longer, but forget about the other longest because that's really out of your control. What about the quality of life while you're alive? That's what I think of. If you're 258 lbs, your quality of life sucks unless you're a giant. Unless he's as big as Frances and Ghana, you know? I mean really literally. That's like in Ghana, his weight class. How the fuck? Yeah, that was, is that how that big, let's Atkins is fucking giant gorilla. I mean, how was he? How was he have 258 pounds? That's not good. I agree with you. Quality of life. Like, if I'm here, you know, if I'm going to get an extra two years, but I'm going to be like weak and feeble and not able to do anything, like what are those two years' worth? It I feel that the best diet is the one you can follow. And utilizing a ketogenic style diet and utilizing intermittent fasting, I think it helps kill hunger. I think it helps kill cravings. And so I think it's a diet that in my opinion one of the easier diets to to it might be hard

Speaker 3:          02:49:07       for some people that really like carbs and they might have to find something different. Uh, but for me it's always worked for him it's always worked well. He is essential. Atkins Diet did put people into ketosis. Yeah. Fed. It wasn't really the um, the goal of it. It wasn't a goal to get weird shit to eat a lot of like bars and things like that. You intake sugar, alcohol and a lot of things in there that probably are just not great for you to imagine. Those atkins bars are really good if you like to Fart. Yeah. I mean that stuff is fun. Clear a room. They make some crazy stuff and like, like chocolate, caramel, anything that's going to be like that can't be good for you in any way really. You know, flavors. Yeah. It's all fake. And that's hot farts. Yeah. Whether you're doing a ketogenic diet, a Vegan diet or any diet, you should stick to real whole foods.

Speaker 3:          02:49:55       And one of the things Rob Wolf taught me was, you know, by things that don't have nutrition labels on them. And just that simple thing. When you think about it, you're like, yeah, if I buy vegetables all neat and it doesn't have that. Okay. Gotcha. Let's wrap this up. Uh, big, strong fast on twitter. Mark Smelly Bell on twitter.
