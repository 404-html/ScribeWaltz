Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. So you now have taken some time off from fighting because of concussions. Right. And tell me about that. So yeah, it was actually, I think you were at my last fight. It was a, I fought mark the bond, you know, rest in peace. I remember we talked about the, yeah, what happened to us? Did they find out what happened to him? I didn't know. A lot of this stuff is coming out is in Dutch and Dutch newspapers. And I'm asking all of the Dutch community kind of what's happening and they don't really know. You hear different things and rumors, but I don't want to listen to rumors. I don't want to hear it from like a concrete source. And we went missing and then they found his body. Then they basically found his body. Yeah. So why or who knows? But he was a great, Carrie wrote, he was amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:43          Excellent, excellent fighter, you know? And uh, he was another guy. But boy, you know, you look at him, he looked like a computer programmer. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's a, it's interesting how it looks. Can Be so deceiving. It's super, super high level guy. Yeah. But that was my last fight. And um, from there was actually a really tough, I never really opened up about it to be honest with you. And it was, uh, a very tough experience. Um, you know, you've got to think, I just win the world title and I'm going home to Canada, which my concussion was pretty bad where I shouldn't have even gone on a plane home. And next thing you know, I'm at home and just the concussion concussions got really bad. I had to be hospitalized for a few days and uh, I was in a dark room for three weeks.

Speaker 1:          01:24          Man, I could not get out of a dark room for three weeks. I couldn't walk. Um, I guess something with a concussion and started causing some neurons, but I'm nervous, you know, nerve damage. That could be me. Yeah. So it can cause some nerve damage. I have X. I was like in a bed, man. Couldn't even look out. I had a little red light on my phone charger was too much. Really? It was bad, man in red light on the phone charger would hurt your head. I couldn't even look at a thing. So it was at that point, it was like, man, it's like I just win this world title. And it was a really tough time. And this is actually the first time I've really opened up about it, but it was a tough experience and it being in that, you know, downstate where you're basically in a dark room for three weeks.

Speaker 1:          02:05          Um, doctors were just, you know, handy me over shit ton of percosets and oxies to kind of deal with the pain. And it was, uh, it was, it was a tough time, man. And it really, I think what was the hardest was what was happening mentally. I'm sitting there and being like, man, I just want a world. I don't want to get back in there. I want to, you know, do so much in this sport. And my goal was to be a legend in the sport, but, you know, and then it got to the point I saw my family and how much it was affecting my family. And that's when I decided that, you know what, let's put this, uh, unrest for a little bit. So you win the fight and after the fight is over, was it immediately that you knew something was wrong?

Speaker 1:          02:41          It honestly, I had some adrenaline rush and I did the post fight press conference. Everything was fine. I was just, when I got back to the hotel room and I was throwing up and couldn't leave my room and I was surprised that even got on an airplane home, the doctors in Canada or like, how the heck did you get on an airplane home? So it was scary times, man. And it took a lot of good mental strength, uh, to get out of it. And now I'm actually in a, in a position where I'm super happy and I'm loving it. I got that whole color commentary role with Gloria, which has been incredible. But you know, the Pr, I think the problem was that saturated fat was demonized. Well, it was demonized in a very corrupt way, which is the, the, the recent New York Times article that was released, which was a mindblower, which detailed how the sugar industry had bribed scientists to release data, blaming saturated fat for heart disease and obesity and all these issues when it was in fact sugar that was causing all that.

Speaker 1:          03:39          So they were literally rigging the system and paying scientists and it was a horrible article because that propaganda and these lies that they spread. I believe it was in the 50s. Here it is, how the sugar industry shifted the blame to fat. And it's if you get a chance and you want to feel sick at what can be done with money, watch or read that because it's just, it's awful. It is really awful. And um, it was an internal sugar industry document that was discovered by a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco and it was published, it said Monday when this was out, I believe it was a couple of months ago. Um, but it was amazing. It suggested that five decades of research into the role of nutrition in heart disease, including many of today's dietary recommendations may have been largely shaped by the sugar industry and propaganda and money.

Speaker 1:          04:31          They spent money to literally bribe scientists to release false data. It's horrible. It's really nasty, but I mean the thing is not that much money either. Here's a cold, go back to it. Here. They paid three Harvard scientists, the equivalent of $50,000 in today's dollars to publish in 1967 review of research on sugar, fat, and heart disease. The studies using the review were handpicked by the Sugar Group and the article which is published in the prestigious new New England Journal of medicine, minimize the link between sugar and heart health and cast aspirations on the role of saturated fat. Even though the influence peddling revealed and documents dates back to nearly 50 years. More recent reports show that the food industry has continued to influence nutrition science.

Speaker 2:          05:16          You know, I'm obviously a big, easy target for a guy who works the door here. He's going to destroy me, you know, like of course how the mighty will fall, but I still think it would be fun anyway. What does it feel like knowing that you roasted the president of the United States, you rose to trump is it is totally, totally a weird feeling. And I saw him a couple of weeks ago. I saw him down in Florida and exchanged pleasantries and I'll let you take your kid and you were just talking about that on stage. I saw him, uh, in Palm Beach and uh, his golf course. You're doing it as golf course. Having lunch. I always stand your life. Jeff Ross is, is like nobody else's. I follow him on fucking instagram and like, Hey, every night he's in a different city with a different set of cool people. Well, when you're a successful man, you don't have children.

Speaker 2:          06:07          I'm not married. You can do whatever the fuck you want. Jesus. What a life. Yeah, you really do have a good life in that regard. You're free as a bird. It is cool. How the fuck have you managed to not get tied down? I'm ready to get tied down and you're ready. I wish I'd say they say that. Who could? Who could do that are around us? That's not true. I would like to settle down. Really? Yeah. I haven't met the right person. Hmm. Well, how come you haven't met the right person? You're in a new city every night. You fuck constantly travel. Maybe. Yeah. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong way. Do you think you came close a couple times? Do you think you'll have a little jeff someday? I really hope so. Yeah. 50 yeah. That's all right. Why? Because your as bad.

Speaker 2:          06:54          I really think so. If it tasted, it's probably better sound. No, freak me out. Don't freak me out. You already told me that Bruce Lee video wasn't where he thought. The Bruce Lee video. Bruce Lee playing ping pong with nunchucks. He thought that was rude. How are you serious? They're round. No checks are brown and blue. Fuck is back. Good time it you'd have to time like the ping pong. It's not like a paddle. This like a rigid thing where you can kind of hit it. You get the time to swing it a thing? Well, he was definitely a bad ass, no doubt about it, Huh?

Speaker 3:          07:44          Yeah.
