Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Yeah. Three, two,

Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Youngstown the house. How are you brother? Good. How you doing? Thanks for doing this man. I appreciate it. No, thanks for having me on. I appreciate it. You were out here. I'm working with Danny Garcia, [inaudible] Garcia, Mikey Garcia and Garcia camp. Um, oh. So I came out, you know, a couple of things. Uh, as we mentioned earlier, a buddy of mine, uh, mark with Micah told us some ideas around and Kinda just taking a week out here in California to, you know, keep moving. It's nice, right? Yeah, it is. Yeah. Yeah, it was nice. And uh, Ohio, believe it or not. And then this morning they woke up to like three inches of snow, so I'm out here enjoying and they got the snow. Well, the thing about La is no one's from here, so everybody grew up in a place like Youngstown or something like that. Like you were saying, you're running into a bunch of Youngstown people out here.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       Tony Hinchcliffe got super excited to see you. Absolutely. And I'm a, you know, that's what's weird about that. I'm excited to see him and he's excited to see me and this, uh, it was really cool. Um, you know, I've heard of Tony and I knew of Tony, you know, before and everything, and then to finally be able to meet them and somebody from Youngstown as doing, you know, great things. It was Kinda cool. So yeah. No, it was cool hanging out with you when we were in Columbus too. That was a fun time. I was, I was good eating stew. Yeah. What was the name of that place again? You guys picked it, I believe in Italian market. I think it was joint. Was that, is that it was your friend's friend of a friend of Mike Brown's friend, right? I don't remember the name. Matthew Morrel another good guy.

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       Yeah. No, he's, he's a fucking scary dude. Just savage. I got to tell you a funny story with him. We're at my gym and he came and did a seminar at my gym and uh, it was, I have just a fitness gym right now there. And he was going over and he was showing people when he kinda came in. And I was showing him like a little punch in a hook and he started doing the elbow off the hook. Now I'm a pretty big guy and now since I retired and um, you know, and I'm working on losing the weight but he hit me with that elbow on my arm and it just hurt and it was slow motion. He wasn't throwing it hard and I'm going to at this son of a bitch, really wanted to turn that over. I wouldn't want to get hit by it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:06       Yeah, elbows are awful. Bones are awful. It's like, it always weirds me out that the UFC has little padding on the gloves but there's no padding in your shins. No padding on your elbows, no padding on your knees to terrible way to take a beating. It is and people get into the brutality of it. Unfortunate not cause I boxed. I think box is more brutal. Only reason is because if you get dropped in boxing and you got 10 seconds to get up, your brand could be rattled in the first round and you can get dropped four more times than not fight. You got 36 minutes of fighting, unfortunately in MMA. Yeah. They were hitting you with the knees, the elbows. And if you go down, they usually stop to fight. Yeah. Rightfully so because somebody could come down with an atomic knee dropping, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:02:50       I know, but I'm just saying it's a, or anything can happen in it. So when you are fighting a MMA wasn't as big as it is now, but did you ever think about doing it? No. And I'll be honest with, you know, um, but I was always interested in, I was, I was always interested in the martial arts. Um, actually that's how I got into boxing was a young kid taking taekwondo and, and uh, I don't know that's how you pronounce it, but it's okay. And, um, you know, I got into it with that. It was, to me, it was kind of like boring. I'm a young kid, you know, I was full of Piss and vinegar and I wanted to actually get in and do something and I played other sports. But, uh, you know, and then after I retired a little bit, um, I kind of strayed away from everything in the fight game and, um, and I started getting interested in Jujitsu and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       And how old were you when you retired? 30. 30. That's young. Yeah. Still am pretty young. How old are you now? 36. Yeah. You're still in the range? Yeah, no, it's the effective range. Oh, that's why I've been working out and I, you know, I, I kind of slowed down on the power lifting a lot and I've been doing, getting a flexible again. So you haven't had a fight in six years. Do you ever get the itch? That's why I'm saying right now. Yeah. Yeah. I've been, um, well another reason why I came out and we'll talk about what mark and everything, but, you know, I don't want to leave nobody ever on either, you know, this is something you just think I'm really thinking about it and I'm working out losing the weight. But at the same time, there's a lot of process behind that too.

Speaker 1:          00:04:26       I would have to sit down with the family. Um, just go over a lot of things. You know, you're doing any boxing these days. Hey, I've been working out just sitting the bag pads, stuff like that. Um, you know, I'm still lifting, but nothing if you're Jack Dude, look at the size of your fucking arms. I know I was up a fight in middleweight son, no cruiser weight as to the Nice area right now. The range. Yeah. Anybody but USAC and uh, I'm not fighting nut. That guy's scary as fuck. Yeah, I don't, you know, the thing is everybody, I did, I've mentioned this a couple of weeks ago and the first thing that came out about it was he needed the money so I can't win for losing. Um, you know what I mean? Like, cause there's other things right now that we're talking about actually been in contact believer or not what desks and with the stars and uh, Jesus, I'm, I'm having fun with it now.

Speaker 1:          00:05:13       I guess it don't make no joke. So I tried to take a fight. I'd rather fight, use sick, believe me. It's for the stars is fucking hard work. Man talks, talks of it. Which my buddy Mark's doing, I've had a couple friends that have been on that. I said it's brutally hard work. It is a virtual or teas who was a fighter. Been on it. Yeah. So that's where it's going. Why I don't want people also the rumor mill will start nut he's broke. He needs the money because it's absolutely not the case. Um, so you retired healthy. Yeah. You retired young and you set some money away but you still look, you were a world champion for a reason. You know you had to become a real world champion. You have to have some crazy drive competitive

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       fire inside you. So there is a, you know, a lot of people don't understand in any combat sport callbacks, combat Umma not pat myself on the back. I don't know if it's even good to say but you know, combat role to champion athletes and fighter's mentality wise, you always going to have that mentality, you know and my only reason why I'm even throwing this around and I guess that's the right term to use because if nothing comes up, I don't want the backlash on that either. Because I'm still only 36 and I at that point where I got that small window still, you know, where I'm not 40, I'm not 38 and uh, you know, I've been healthy for, you know, four and a half years and I've been working out. And what made you decide to go power lifting? Just kinda know. It's telling me US fucking show bitches whatsoever.

Speaker 2:          00:06:52       That's another one. Guns. Exactly right. I was tired and think about it. I was so damn skinny. If I turned sideways and stuck my tongue out of the book a Zipper, you know what I mean? Um, and being six foot 200 and make it happen to make 160 pounds, even between fights, you still had to maintain your weight. And I got tired of that. Uh, what was your walking around with? I'll walk around about one 73. That's not that bad. No, it's not. And that's a real light and you know, and then, but as I got older, yeah, I started getting a little more difficult to, you know, keep that and I started getting up to like one 75, almost one 80. So now you're looking at a, and I'm still skinny at that point. So now you're looking at it how can to lose 20 more pounds again to get down at that age.

Speaker 2:          00:07:35       And it came to a point, um, which cause a lot of issues for me, one flight with the Martinez fight and uh, after that we had to jump out. Hmm. Yeah. That point of diminishing returns, right? When you're just cutting too much weight. When you fuck Tremaine Taylor, that was one 60, right? Yes. Yeah, too. I was one fight where I remember getting angry at Larry Merchant was Larry Merchant's calling a fight. I'm like, he's not, he's wasn't recognizing that you were tuning him up and you were hurting him and he like, he was, he was commenting on a, almost like it was a trend that he expected to see rather than what was actually happening. It was a lot of things about that fight. I loved them guys because believe it or not, in my opinion, that was a great fight. And I seen that day had that fight and a top 10 middle weight, uh, one of the top 10 middle way fights of all time.

Speaker 2:          00:08:24       And that's kind of a cool thing. But also, you know, some of that commentating, no really made that fight, especially at the end in my opinion, made that flight kind of what it was also, you know, besides the fact that me getting dropped and everything, but um, I didn't agree with the judging of it, you know, cause I still had me ahead. I went back and wash it. I'm not one of those egotistical people use or like I like to really break down what happened in that fight and I, and if I lost a round, I would say I lost around, you know, I was hard on myself with that. I watched that fight and I'll probably 10 times and I don't see where they

Speaker 1:          00:08:55       had remained winning, you know? Yeah. I gave him one round and plus the 10, eight. So as a total of three rounds and, uh, I don't see how that happened. Well, you know, I mean we, we've had this conversation a hundred times in this podcast, but judging and boxing and judging in MMA judging is just terrible. It's just terrible. It's sad. It doesn't make any sense. There's so many experts out there. There's so many really reliable people that you can call on that would do a great job of, of, of figuring out what's going on in a fight. And for whatever reason, they don't get those jobs. I think they gotta start doing something soon. Inbox and what that, yeah. They have to figure something out. What the judging Charlo fight. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. There's a handful of people I had the argument with that actually thought Charlotte lost.

Speaker 1:          00:09:41       Um, I didn't think that he looked as good as he could have enough flight. Yeah. But I thought he wanted to fight, you know, um, one 16, one 12. Uh, but I don't know what system they could try to break down for that or tried to get to actually start making some of them fights fair. But boxing is doing fantastic to pass two years. I mean the numbers are crazy. You seem what does zone? There were Canelo and yeah, so it's, it's there. Just the attention is that the sport and the popularity of it's coming back, but what could eventually hurt it again is things like the judging of the flights. Yeah. Outcomes. Well there's certain ones where you, you want to like you want a criminal investigation like Tim Bradley, Manny Pacquiao. That was one where after that was up I was like, I was looking at the TV, I was looking to the side. I was looking at where I was like, what the fuck did I just see what just happened here? Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:10:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:35       That flight rate there, I actually had to walk away with my head down.

Speaker 1:          00:10:40       I that that was probably one of the worst robberies that I've ever seen. It was horrible robbery. I searched to give Tim Bradley two rounds. I gave him one. I was trying to give him rounds there. Kyle Lake say, how? Where did you get to set in other words and I couldn't do it. Yeah, I loved him. Bradley too, by the way. Awesome guy. Awesome. Awesome fighter too. I mean he's just all hard. I mean the guy's, he's amazing. But that just was a bad decision. And you know, I think there was a, there was a lady that was responsible for two really bad decisions. That word? Yeah, to lady bird. Was it her? Was it? There was another one too. There was an adult bird. She does have a May two I want to say. Ah, yeah. Ladder. Letterman's daughter baby. Well there was no, there was another lady who retired from doing it after that decision. It was like a big controversy. People were her, her score was so off. People were thinking she got paid off just so many anymore though. It's hard to keep up with it. Well, the thing is, and people that are cynical or skeptical, do you know how much money is being bet on fights? Especially a Manny Pacquiao fight. There's so much money. And if someone like packing, I was a prohibitive favorite heading to 10 proudly fight. I mean, who knows? It could be four to one five, two, one six, two, one. Somebody rolls up with

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       a Nice Brown bag, you fill it. We got in here, here's $30,000 I never have to report. I think just, yeah, there was more behind why that happens to be. That's always been the idea that there's no bribery going on anymore. It's crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:12:10       I don't want to say it, but I think I have, yeah, I think I have an idea. You know, I think it comes down to who's putting the show on

Speaker 4:          00:12:17       [inaudible] and who's who's in the pocket. But Teddy Atlas was explaining it to when he was on the podcast. One of the things that he was saying was that they take these people out to dinner, like the, like they're all in cahoots and friendly with each other and if there's a certain result that the promoter would like to see, these judges will lean towards that if they have a good relationship with that promoter. You said it for me. Yeah. That's what it is. Look, teddy laid it out

Speaker 2:          00:12:43       and um, I don't know. Yeah, it's bad because again, boxes really coming back. It is and the fights, you got three or four weight classes right now. That's so interesting. But the bad part about it is you don't get interested in it or you don't get as excited anymore because you're afraid of the outcome of that.

Speaker 4:          00:12:59       Yeah. You know, I wasn't terribly upset at the wilder fury decision. I wasn't terribly upset. I thought, I thought, you know what? I think Tyson fury did enough to win. But when I look at it, I like when I like when they scored damage damage means a lot to me. And when I look at that fight, when, when wild or hurt him, he heard him twice and he heard him real bad. I mean I think that's worth a lot and I think he was always threatening. So I felt like, I don't know if I would agree with a draw. I think it was a close decision when for Tyson fury, but I didn't hate it. I didn't hate it cause I think I'd like to see them fight again. Absolutely. I mean it was one of them fights

Speaker 2:          00:13:46       where yes, you're 100% right. That it could have been a draw and I think everybody would be kind of satisfied with that. Yeah. Um, unfortunately with the account and knocked down, which I was so frustrated with the comments and you know, I had to stay away from the social media and the boxing groups and, and things like that because, oh, just, you know, to some of the opinions of people as the way to put it. Uh, well deaf, that was a long count and this and that. There has been thousands of fights in the last 10 years and I've very solid heard anybody complain about account, you know, that, that fight. Um, they don't do a ten second count unboxing and he'd go by the referees count and for another thing, we're a wilder kind of hurt himself. Referee tells you in the locker room before the flight and he explains it to go to your neutral corner.

Speaker 2:          00:14:35       If you come out of your neutral corner, I will stop the account mean you know that. So the first thing I used to do it when I dropped somebody is I ran my ass to that neutral corner. You know, said I worked for, we can start counting. Um, I didn't see any issue with the, the knockdown, I even recorded it on my phone. And if you did go by the ten second count, Tyson fury still beat it. Really? Yes, I have it. You know, I'd have to go through and find it. Um, I thought I saw it on a Instagram or one of them. It was, I think it was on Wilders Instagram where he had it, where worthy count starts. Right when fewer drops. I counted it as soon as his back almost right before his back kits to ground until where he got up. And again, that's only a ten second count without a referee even come on over to, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:15:17       Okay. Um, but you know, as far as the, the fight itself, I gave, I gave Walter obviously the two knock downs that's automatically four rounds. But I thought, and I gave him one other round after that. I thought Tyson fairy controlled the action. You know, I had controlled the momentum of the fight. On the flip side of it, I think that water actually could've made that an easier fight to, you know, water actually has a hard time. What is control and he don't know how to really work to the body. I don't want to put it on a trainer. I don't know what the issue is with that. But he neglected that body a lot throughout the flight. And I just thought that's why Tyson when most of those rounds, you know, he just controlled the action to pace and was kind of able to do what he wanted to.

Speaker 2:          00:16:00       And I think that if Walter went backward, his trainer and watched the tape would have light, they're going to see a lot of opportunities that were missed enough light. Well, you know what's crazy about wilder is how little time he's actually been boxing. I mean it's really stunning. When he was on here, he told us that he made the Olympic team a year and a half into war learning boxing. Yeah. And he won a bronze medal in the heavyweight division though. You can kind of get away with that too. Yeah, you can. You know, most of your heavy for, well back then also we're big guys who came up. Usually most of them were football players or something like that. And they kind of just got into the sport and still even to this day you were talking about maybe three heavyweights that really could throw it down. Um, as were some of the other guys are just big sloppy guys that come in, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:16:43       So what do we got now? You got Luis Ortiz, you got fury, you wilder. Josh. Joshua. Who else? Joseph Parker. Yeah. Parker Parker is one of the guys that could actually still upset anybody in the heavyweight division, especially with that style that he has. Um, so it's getting interesting again though. It is. It's certainly, well I think with wilder and fury, that was one of the more interesting heavyweight title fights in a long time. And while there's so, it's so weird. He's so different. He weighs 209 pounds. He's skinny as a rail. He hits you. It looks like you get hit in the face with a missile. I mean, it's crazy cause that is a missile he's firing. Fuck, you know, crazy power that guy and I tried to explain to people when I tell you, you don't have to be a big guy. Yeah. You know, it's all about the leverage, how he did torque. Uh, where are you, how you generate that power and no, he's just one of them guys that that's one of the things were you either have it, yeah, you got it in the cradle or you don't. And that's another one that you tried to explain. And even like in baseball, you're either a home run hitter or you're not, you know, you could on a little bit and

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       maybe knock one or two more home runs out or knock a guy or two out more. But if you don't have, you're not going to, unless you really go back over and find the time and patience to reprogram that fighter and change the whole style. Yeah. It feels like one punch knockout power. You either have or you don't and, but the, the guys who can put it on you and stop you like Julio. Cesar Chavez never had really that one punch knockout power, but he fucked a lot of people up and he had a body shot too. He did not, he didn't need a knock out punch to the head too. He was so perfect when he was in his prime. The way he would fight was constant bobbing, weaving, moving in, and then once he put that pace on you, it was just constant damage, constant punch to the volume, the volume to accuracy and the fact that he never got tired, he would just keep that pace up.

Speaker 1:          00:18:39       Pap Pap, pap, pap pap, and you'd see guys just start to wilt. Just backing up all the time. Just wilt under that pressure. Then as that body attack that he had, how he invested into that body from the early rounds, people carry those punches. You know, they carried out into the fifth and six round and it was brutal. You know, I couldn't imagine a fight and I fly some tough guys, but I was glad, you know, being a tall guy that nobody ever went to the body like that. I guess me, I would've hated that. It's a, it's fucking rough way to make a living, bro. There is Chavez in his prime. God Damn was good. Ooh. It was so good. I mean, it's just constant movement to constant cutting angles and the fucking pressure. Another one like him was Duran too. That's Roger Mayweather, right?

Speaker 1:          00:19:24       Yes. Yeah. Black Mamba. Yeah. People forgot about Roger. He just systematically broke you down. Chavez. Yeah. Very tactical and textbook and it make many mistakes. It wasn't flashy. He wasn't overly fast. He wasn't overly powerful. But he just broke you down the right way and to the right punches. Yeah, that's what, that's the best way to put it. Through the right punches. He was just relentless and he was constantly moving forward. Constant pressure. God Damn. He was good. Yup. And you know, uh Oh Greg Halligan. Oh, remember that one Greg Hogan said he found a bunch of Tijuana taxi drivers and he'd beat the shit out of break out those those left hooks the body. But just like tough taxi drivers, young fighters, man, you want to like emulate a guy who just fought with perfect technique. This is the guy. Well you know that comes down to another thing that I was breaking down.

Speaker 1:          00:20:15       I actually, I touched on it on my show a lot and a lot of people get mixed up and confused on a fact of foot work. What people and some of the guys that had the best footwork in boxing, we're not flashy guys with the footwork or even like Mikey Garcia now or like a a Bernard Hopkins is another one. But you had guys pronounce a word occur. I know I'm going to probably get beat up on this. He, he, he had decent footwork. What I mean by that because, because yeah, he make you miss. But Brunel would occur a lot of times, put himself out of range

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       by moving lake that, you know, he make that move or he'd do it too much. And then he wasn't there to counter. So what good did it do? A, you get guys like Chavez or Duran or a guys like Mikey Garcia now they take that one little step inches and angles. They take that one step and earn brightened position for that punch. They take the opposite step to suffocate your punch, you know, and throw you off. They spin you around, you know, that's where footwear comes in. And Chavez was great at that.

Speaker 4:          00:21:14       Yeah. Um, he was always in range. He was always in range. He was never, never running away. And Yeah. Yeah. And his like, you know, the guy who does it the best today about cutting angles and being bright in front of you, you can't him is Luma Chanko oof. I mean, Loma Chanko stands right in front of you and then he's not, and then he's over here and he's punching you in the face. Tj Dillashaw, who's a UFC bantamweight champion, said he's sparred with him. And he said the first round was like, you know, Lomas Shankles just feeling them up, just figuring them out and you know, he's like, no, I'm kind of hanging in there with this guy. And then his dad yelled something in Russian and then the second round Loma Cenk goes just dancing around him, stepping to the side, touching them

Speaker 2:          00:21:57       Zoe round they put on youtube too. You know what I mean? Um, yeah, I see. You know, the thing with Lowman Chanko is this, uh, and I tell people also like Floyd Mayweather was, is unbelievable defensive fighter. But Floyd was really good on drawing you in, you know, and kind of countering off that his defense and his reflexes were amazing, but he kind of lured you in a little bit, made you miss, make, made you make a mistake, and then he would counter you. Loma Chanko on the other hand, as a guy, you could throw a punch and f punched could be emitter and he's spinning and he's already behind you. Yeah, it's a, the athleticism is astonishing. I have not seen it. Uh, granted, can he lose? Absolutely. It's boxing. And if you get one of them rugged guys that are just going to come in and say, you know what, screw it, I'm going to, I'm just going to get hit, but I'm going to hit him. That may be a type of fighter that beats Alma Chanko. Okay,

Speaker 4:          00:22:48       well, well who was it that was it the Mexican guy who beat him? Uh, in uh, one of his first fight.

Speaker 2:          00:22:54       Oh, uh, Selise Salito Salito right, right, right. Yeah. That was the kind of fight that he fought. His dirty got on top of him. But you got to understand on that point too, that was Loma Chanko second pro fight and I guess a real veteran guy who's been there and done it and seen it. And that's the argument and it's hard to explain again. And that was another argument on, he's a dag is a little frustrated reading second pro fight and usually in boxing and it goes like the first year you're up for six, second year he may be, you start getting up to eight, but you get a good amount of fights under your belt before you start getting into the 10 rounds and 12 rounds. Okay. Um, you're talking about a kid coming out of the amateurs fighting three, three minute rounds are for two minute rounds depending on whatever tournament or international it is.

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       And he's going right into a Charl 12 round fight. I know my myself coming up and the process that top rung brought me up, which was a great process to, they've had, they pick the fights and they made sure that if ice that they pick for me where to correct flights and a Gruen me the right way, you know, by rounds and everything else. And I know just jumping from six to eight, the difference in that, you know, let alone being a kid and you're going into your second pro fight and you're fighting a 12 round fight. So if he lost that fight, which he came back and he made it a really close fight, I would have to tip my hat to him just on the fact that he was able to go 12 rounds, you know, um, people take a lot away from, from that fighter. What he accomplished is something that not many can do. Well, it's crazy mean he had a second protitle at what, how many fights in the second fight was for the role title that he wanted to roll side on his dirt profile. Yeah, that's insane. And then, but he's had more than one per world title, right? Yes. He, he's won a could three different ways

Speaker 5:          00:24:48       classes, but his second one was something insane. Some insanely short seat. Pull up his record. Yeah. I believe Tom Bradley. I looked at the source. What's that? It says his first fight was for the international featherweight title that was against Salito Ramirez. He said, Oh, you lost against Lido for the vacant Wbo featherweight title. Oh, okay. So what was the first title? International featherweight title. Wbo Yeah, that's not a real, that's not like a world title. This is, they have a bunch of weird titles, right? Like international title, continental title. You're assaulting me. I had to do an IPO. I had to deal with the world champion. But you had all of it. You are unified. I should have been by all rights. But Taylor vacated to Oh, that's right. But he, you know, that's why I get mad. And that's another big argument. And boxing how you break that down between the lineal, the lineal and a unanimous, you know, I had to ring the Wbo scroll, Scroll up.

Speaker 5:          00:25:42       So you see his homework. So what was his, uh, okay. So his second world title was when routined retained one. Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six flights in. He's in his second. He's um, he, that's when he, he, he wins his second title. Six fights in each one's a junior lightweight title. That's insane. The International, okay. That wasn't the first one. Wasn't a world title fight. It was the right with the second one was the Wbo world title fight 11 fights. Any wins is third world title. What in the fuck I believe now there was at one point it was seven rural champions and just that short period of fights, I believe it's around eight now, eight real champions, these flat and just that short period, a three different weight classes. I think when he fought were gone d out, you really got a chance to see how he handles a real world class, you know, Cuban amateur system trained top of

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       the food chain boxer and he just put it to that dude. That was the fight that I actually really sold me on [inaudible] because I thought for a fact that that was going to be a chess match because of the boxing ability from rigging dollar. Their styles were very similar and I thought that, you know, I was like, it's going to be a boring fight for the first like four rounds, which I still would have liked because I like watching that type of fights, you know? And um, I see. I go in there and I'm expecting this fight, you know, the, the amateur background of both guys, the how talented the guys are in a skill level of both guys. And then mixing, I know I'm two or three rounds into it and I'm going, he's playing what? We're no playing with them. I'm going to hell.

Speaker 1:          00:27:26       That's the fight that really sold me on Loma Chanko that he's that good. My Man Vinny pass the ends are called that not Vinny Pazienza, the boxer, Vinnie pads, the rapper, this guy, Jedi mind tricks he called and he was taking, he was taking bets on Instagram. Jeez. He called it that early too. He was taking bets on Instagram. You think [inaudible] has anything for him? He's like five, 5 million, the DMS. And he goes, let's bet. Yup. I uh, I took Loma Chanko and that flight, but I thought it was going to be a close fight, a really close fight. And I thought Loma Chanko was going to pull ahead in the later rounds, you know, and when that fight. So that's why I really surprised me. It was a stunning display of talent. He such a weird guy too because uh, his background, you know, the store where his father took him out of boxing and made him do traditional Russian dancing for several years and just made him learn that for footwork.

Speaker 1:          00:28:18       It seems like his dad was just a mastermind architect of a champion. Yeah. You would probably know more than this. The Nub would, didn't he also have a more short background? I heard, uh, he definitely can do martial arts techniques. I've seen it, but I don't know what background maybe, I don't know. That makes sense. He's a, his foot work though is so extraordinary and if that really is that dancing background, like learning the, the footwork and the, the way he, he's so agile with the stepping of his feet. It's like, I think a lot of people are going to learn and mirror that. Yeah. His training regimen is pretty brutal. Also, I got a buddy, a Roger Romo, um, good friend of mine. He's actually, he was working for a little while there up until the last fight. He was a strength and conditioning coach would Cecilio Flores, who was mine when I was an Ochsner training and they said it was just crazy that the hours that he puts in, how he trains, how hard he trains and some of the journals study does. You know, I, I'm looking at them and going, I could use these, not for me, but I could use them for somebody athletes that I got now. Yeah. He's, um, he's definitely something special and you know, you get those guys and it's just, it's kind of ashamed that he's a little too small for Terrence Crawford, you know? I mean, I really would love to see those two fight, but it seems like Crawford just a little bit too heavy for him. I agree. But that's uh, you know, and that's another touchy subject because I kind

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       of agree with you, but I also go back, cause I'm always trying to really break down and nitpick. I look at guys like Manny Pacquiao [inaudible] who was it, who came from I believe one 12 or something like that, and went up all the way to junior middleweight, which is crazy. Yeah, he's small. Shorter than than Lowman Shanker. Yeah. And other than his calves. And I don't think anything else was much bigger than Lowman Chanko on his body and he was able to do it. And what the fuck is going on with his calves? I don't know. It's like he's keeping Hams in them. I don't know what he does. I, you know, I wish I knew to secret today cause I could use it. So get that secret to Jon Jones article says that his mother was actually a martial arts, still is a martial artist. Oh, interesting. Hmm. Gymnast. The martial artist. Well it makes sense.

Speaker 4:          00:30:26       Yeah. Man. Foot work the way he does it. It's just, it's something to watch, man. It's just the, the, the ability to do move and also to anticipate the other fighters movements. It's like, especially earlier in his career, it's like he was fighting guys that just, they seemed so

Speaker 2:          00:30:43       crude in comparison to his approach. He knows even more crazy about it as being the opponent because usually you go into a fight and you break down film and you're, you're going over to film and you got a good idea of what he does, right. What he does wrong and, and what you might have to do launch Chanko it's hard to pick up where he's going to go. He'd be different angles. So you can't, you can't go well, you know what? After he throws the right hand, he likes to move over to the left because he does at one time and then the next time he's totally something we're opposite. You know what I mean? And yeah, the angles, it's really almost impossible to break film down on them. You know, like this last fight with just per draws, everybody's going. That was the blueprint. No, no, no. It wasn't. So, you know, he, uh, interstate and it was a close to fight then, you know, people expect expected. I go, why? Because he finally got hit with more than 11 punches in a fight. Oh, that's him doing some, uh, I'd be like, yeah, he says trained it when he was a younger Greco Roman.

Speaker 4:          00:31:37       Yeah. Yeah. He's, he's slamming kids. That's right. Well, you know what man, I believe in cross training and I think that there's certainly some skills that would make you better at different martial arts. And uh, I feel like if you have the ability to wrestle guys and, and move guys' bodies around like that you would get from something like samba. I just feel like as a an elite boxer, having that extra strength, that extra ability to move your core that way, I think that would be beneficial. Yeah. I mean the thing is no worldclass boxer has the time to also be doing judo and also be doing wrestling. You just don't have the time.

Speaker 2:          00:32:15       Nope. And then being in combat sports, even, I know that as far as, I'm not involved in MMA, but I know that, you know, these guys, they have a perfect three or four as much time in a short period of time. You know, I imagine, I think Matt was telling me you would know more. Like, sometimes it's two days of one, two days of the next. Um, trying to fit that in. Yeah, it's hard. You cannot, especially in boxing the sweet science

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       where it's just hands, but you got people, that's all he do all day long. That's why I say it's so unfair when an MMA guy goes in fights of Mayweather because Mayweather, he perfected that and you gotta use just that style of boxing. It's going to be almost impossible to beat a boxer, a rural champion boxer. Did you watch the new year's fight, that thing that he did with the attention? Yes. You Cower. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people think that was a fixed fight. I think that was 120 pound fighter fighting the best ever. Yeah. I mean it's just, it wasn't a fixed fight. I don't know why people think it's a fixed fight. That guy fights it 126 pounds, I think. Yeah. I think that's his weight class. And you could definitely tell the size difference. Just like I could actually tell the size difference stolen McGregor fight, Floyd, you know, I think uh, both of his legs equal to one of Mcgregor's, but yeah, that tension, that fight the first knocked down was legit.

Speaker 5:          00:33:32       And I think, my personal opinion, what happened, it wasn't fixed, you know, are fake. I believe that he got hit with that right hand and it seemed that how strong and how to deep fence the skills that a Mayweather had. And I think he said, you know what, this could be a long ass night. And then the next couple of punches he just kinda like went down because he seen what could happen. He knew which way that flight was going. Really? Yeah. That's what you think. I do the first knock down. Let's put play that fight, see if you can find the fight and play it. I feel like the first one clipped him on the temple. He hit him with a left hook on the temple, hit him with a right hand, but then he hit him with a left hook, the right hand, and then he hit him afterwards as well as he's going down.

Speaker 5:          00:34:10       But I think that left hand the temple is what did the real damage. And then, um, then there was a big right hand afterwards that dropped him. I just think he was out of his league. He's that way, way out of his league. Not that he took a dive, but almost to the point of like, he knew that that fight was not going any way. The way that he thought it was. I mean, he looks, he was so smiley and relaxed. It was kind of funny. You know, he just sort of walk the dude down. He had a big old smile and it tastes like when they get them smiling. What was the last time you saw us? And he's so much bigger than this kid, right? Yeah. He's fighting like it's a joke. Like, look at him. He's so much bigger than this kid.

Speaker 5:          00:34:46       What's really funny is if they let this kid kick, he would fuck Floyd up. Yeah. I feel that I'm Katie Floyd made it look so dominant. I didn't even know on that part. But then again, that kid, his kicks, that kid would've kicked Floyd's legs out from under them in seconds. Oh wait, you went too far there. See He, he got up right there. Boom. See? He hit him with a left hook and he stumbled and then he hit him with the right hand behind it. And I just think he's too little. He's just a, he's a very small guy and for him and Floyd's not a big guy. This kid is tiny. I mean, I think he's fought as light as 121 pounds and I think sometimes he fights it like one 26 yeah, I think he could see right there, right there. Sometimes it'll fight.

Speaker 5:          00:35:30       A lot of times in a fight, the whole issue is you get hit with that and you're fighting and somebody taps you with a certain punch. Your brain. You'll be surprised how fast it works, you know, and all the things that go through it at mind. Boom. That was yep. And I think at that, that moment right there, he just knew going in, you can fill just when somebody hits you on the arm or the shoulder, you know, the how, how punch power they have. And uh, yeah, I think he's just trying to, after that he knew I was going to be a long night. So crazy. They paid him $9 million for this. It must be nice that, yeah. I mean fuck, there was a lot of people I seen going, uh, he deserves to give somebody whose prospects a a chance now, you know, he should be fighting these guys instead of doing this, these guys ain't boxers, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 5:          00:36:18       And my take on that also is the man went 40, 49, 50 and older. He fought almost everybody in the sport. And even if you want to say that they were past her prime, some of them may have been a little bit, he's still willing to earn, dominated them and beat them. Yeah. This guy, in my opinion, if he wanted to fight defensive backs from the NFL, he has all the right and the roller. I don't think that he owes a sport anything. I think actually it's the other way around. The amount of money that he has brought to the sport, the attention that he brought to it. So if he wants to go around and duty side shows, let them, you know, I mean, what do you want him to do? Fight prospects until he's 51 years old. I couldn't agree more. I couldn't agree more.

Speaker 5:          00:36:55       It's crazy. The idea that they want to see him sacrificed. Yeah. They want to see him get beat. That's what they want. They want to see him finally fight someone who's younger and faster, hungrier, who was more active. And what will happen was that he will lose. And I think maybe what a smarter than that, you know, he wants to go out and keep that his status and, and the, and the, the, the record that he built up in that resume that he has and go out like that, you know? Well, they're talking about him fighting Khabib number. Good amount off. Who's the UFC 155 pound champion. But it can be, it's not really a boxer. I just want to say it. But boxing rules. Yeah, he that would be same thing. Yeah. It could be was a take down ground type guy. Exactly. It'd be the same kind of fight as the Conor fight.

Speaker 5:          00:37:37       The only difference is I don't think could be get as tired as Connor would. No, I don't, I don't think, uh, he's, he's definitely got better endurance. I think one of the only few in there right now. That would be a good flight would be one of the Diaz brothers as far as striking down. Be Interesting. But they would, he would box her face off. I still think that he would win that, but I'm just saying as far as you know, stand up and letting the hands go. I think those are one of the, one of the two better ones in the MMA. Yeah. I mean he's got all the right in the world. Just keep fine freak shows to have fun, man. The only thing is, you know, a father time shows up, you know, he's getting to that age where you might get one of them guys. And so, I mean if he's having a fun do it. But if you go and get beat by one of them guys, that could change the whole outlook of a career. Well, it's interesting how guys who are really good defensively, they're not just really good longer because they have such good technique, but also they've taken less damaged during their career so they're more durable

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       as they get older as well. Like you've definitely saw that with Bernard, like Bernard up until the Joe Smith fight me, Joe Smith was the first guy to really put it on. I'm like that and knock them out of the ring. And it was hard to see. It was hard to see that they, they had that ring set up to where he fell and landed on his fucking head like Jesus Christ. You know? I don't know if there was so much to ring. I just think it was an awkward way that he went out of the ropes in a way because he got hurt by that punch. Yeah. So, and the legs buckled and when the legs buckle like that, they could put him in an awkward position for him to slide out. You know, his ass was headed out and then you get clipped again and went right through.

Speaker 1:          00:39:11       But I mean, it just sucks that there's nothing to protect the fighters. If they fall out like that. There's no padding. There's no, no tables, no nothing, nothing to break your fall. No one, therefore it just got to hope one of the ringside judges are, or commentators are there too. That's crazy. And you got guys that are 80 years old trying to push a 200 pound man back in the ring. Yeah. They're not going to get clipped like that and wanting to, somebody's fallen on them. Um, but Bernard was able to keep his skill very late in life. I mean deep into his forties, almost a 50 years old was still world class, which is really crazy. I had is, uh, you got a handful of guys out there that could do that and to be honest, you know, but he kept himself in good shape in between fights and he did what he was supposed to do.

Speaker 1:          00:39:56       And some guys, you know, you get some guys out there, a good friend of mine, my trainer Robert Garcia, retired at 29, um, uh, Youngstown guy, man. See, he retired young and came back a couple of years later, but it was totally for one flight. Um, who did Mancy any come back against Greg Haugen. Oh, that's right. I forgot about that. Fine. Yup. And uh, some of them, you know, some guys they go in and do it and it's, it's fun and then it becomes a career, a job and financial security. You know, the way Pete, a lot of fighters look at it. And then you get some guys like Floyd, Mandy Pack, Yell, uh, Bernard Hopkins who just loved the sport, you know that much that does. They don't know anything else outside of it. So what was it like fighting Bernard who, you know, and I don't know if this is the stage stage I want to fighting Bernard was, it was, it was, um, totally different than what I expected.

Speaker 1:          00:40:53       What'd you expect? I expect him to be tricky and sneaky and just a very crafty and obviously experienced. Um, I did jump up two weight classes to take that fight and um, but at the same time, that was not an 80% Kelly public. And this is true and this is documented. Um, I have it on my phone and I was going to actually bring that out. But that flight I sparred three times for that maybe for the time was with an arm brace and then went into it and I'd never said anything cause I'm the type person, I don't want to have people think that was making excuses. I love Bernard and I think

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       he's, uh, one of the greatest of all time, greatest middleweights. But that was not that night. You know, I came down, we had wrong what was right. I had bronchitis, I was sick, I was running a temp actually in the locker room. We had to go through what the commission, um, we almost took the inhaler for it. Then we found out through the commission that you cannot take that cause it's steroid. So we had to go to the nasal, um, or not nasal to the pill. Oral pill. Uh, we had an in the locker room. I don't know if you ever heard of a Guy Thomas houser. He writes you, he used to write from New York Times. He does a lot of big box and books. He was an urn and houser don't, uh, he's not one side. What's anybody? He's Bryce. What? He knows what he sees and that's the truth.

Speaker 2:          00:42:18       And um, he was in there when the commission came in. They were going through my prescription, you know, they were taking a temperature, uh, giving me the exam. And that's what happened. How it was a look Dardick fight with, uh, of all people. What was wrong with your arm? You, you [inaudible] bursitis, societies, bursitis in your elbow. And you know, that came into an issue and we smart. We know, like I said, it was a handful. It might've been more than three or four, but it wasn't a lot because usually in training camp you do it three days a week for about eight week camp for about six, six and a half weeks. And it was because of your album that you couldn't spar. Yeah. You know, cause he didn't want to keep hitting it. And then I didn't like just the way I am. I didn't like having a brace on it or nothing.

Speaker 2:          00:43:00       Um, so that was an issue and there was a lot of things that sometimes if you could go back and you wish you could do it over again, but there was a lot of other things going on. Why we didn't postpone the fight. First of all is sold out and uh, the Youngstown people bottle or tickets, um, we had the issue with Depaul Williams fight, you know, that fell through. So I can't, I just came off light and Gary Lockett, who was really not of all known name a household name. So if I would to postpone that fight, the backlash on that would have been bad man. And you know, so it was more the ego thing I think, and worried about what everybody was going to think, taking nothing away at all from, and that's where I wanted to tap into taking nothing away from Bernard Hopkins unfortunately against a guy like Bernard Hopkins that had to have that happen to me is what socks.

Speaker 2:          00:43:55       And, and he was a tremendous fighter. I mean, he did things in there. A lot of times I've seen him making moves that I knew what he was doing and I just couldn't pull the trigger on it. Um, and he was fast and he was strong. And then there was times that he just did some crafty things also that, you know, got to me and his body work in that fight slowed me down a lot. But it was just one of them fights where I could honestly say that that was not an 80% Kelly Pollick. And that could be honest and say if I was 100%, I don't know if I would have won that fight. And I'll be honest about it. I'm not going to be the guy that's, that comes in and says, well, if I was 100% I would have knocked him out. No, it's Bernard Hopkins. You know,

Speaker 4:          00:44:33       when you think about your legacy and you think about looking back at your career, those kinds of fights where you had to take it when you were compromised, um, how do those factor in to do those fuck with your head?

Speaker 2:          00:44:45       Hmm. Yeah, that liberal bad way, right? But enough where you like, ah, if I was 100%, yeah. You know, I got invited to the international boxing hall of fame over to summer and it was cool as hell and to be there and you start seeing the inductees and everything and I start, you start breaking down your career. Like, am I, am I able to qualify for this? You know, and it's so, so going to get pissed off who didn't get in because I got in and I look at it and I break it down a couple of ways. I say 40 and two with 34 knockouts is a hell of a record. You know, I held the belts for over three years. Um, I'd be a handful of guys that were legit when I beat them. And then I, then I look at the fight though I fought Bernard Hopkins and I got my ass whooped in fight and there was no other way of putting it, you know, the truth.

Speaker 2:          00:45:34       So how much did that damage? You know, uh, people remembering that nobody looks at the fact of the two way class jump and they call him back down and defending against a very game. Antonio Rubio. And then of course the Martinez fight, which a lot of people, and it was documented and, and on Hbo with the commentators, you know, the weight issue in that fight. But what was the way it is from that? Fine. Oh, so how we had to get done. That was my last fight. At middle weight, you know, trying to cut the weight. I was 29 at the time and another great fighter. I, it happened, it was tough with the weight. Um, I really can't use that as an excuse though, cause I don't know. But you know, I know I was doing good in the ninth round. I did hit a wall.

Speaker 2:          00:46:13       A lot of people would try to use the cut and I think even without the cut, the same result would have happened. Now, you know, he would have boxed my ears off the last four rounds. It was just one of them things that there's nothing you could do. So when I, when I have some up my career, I look at those fights and I, and I know personally that it could have been different, but at the same time I'm very happy and content with the way my career went. You know, I was 40 and two, um, my last four or five, I won my last four fights, you know, before I retire. So I went out winning, um, and, and I was done with the sport. I truly was. And so I, I think right now I'm, I'm kind of content and happy with my career. Of course. I think anybody says could've been better and I wish it was better. It may be a little bit, but I'm not going to have ever beat myself up over it.

Speaker 4:          00:47:00       Well, it's just one of those things where you, when you, when you look back and you think of all the great things that you did accomplish, then you realize that you're retired at 30. Yeah. So much so much room there, you know, thirties so young. You're in your athletic prime. They, I think they say 32 for professional fighter. They consider most athletic primes at 32

Speaker 2:          00:47:22       there was, but you know, uh, I look back on it and again, you know, the 42 fights, that's a lot of fights. Um, plus I started when I was nine and a half, a little over a hundred amateur fights during, there was a lot. What that, I mean for a while there'd be a while before I retired, I was throwing it around, you know, retiring. I was one of them guys that just, I liked it and I loved it, but I also sometimes got tired of it. You know, I'm a very simple guy and, and uh, it don't, I don't care about the Glam or to fame or any of that. I truly don't, you know, like even now what my, my podcast and what I'm doing with some of these other adventures because I got bored and I'm on to have fun. Right. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:48:04       And keep myself busy. And, um, I've been fortunate to have what I have to be able to do all this on my own, you know, and go out there and be around everybody. But yeah. So when I was fighting, you know, there was a lot of rumors around up to retirement, this, that, and I think the final icing on a cake was we were supposed to fight Andre Ward and that's when Andre Ward ended up getting a shoulder surgery and I fight, fell through. And I've been out in California training or an Ochsner trainer for almost a year, which most fighters leave at the beginning of their career. You know, when they don't have a family, when they're not making the money, that's our opportunity to try and go and make money, not when you're 12 years into it, you know. And uh, so I went out there and that kind of took a little bit from here as far as the sport, even though I loved it and it was great training with, uh, Robert Garcia.

Speaker 2:          00:48:55       I learned so much that I think I could learn at that state point in my career. And not that Andre Ward fight fell through. Um, I was, I was done. I mean, I was, I rolled over, I never forget, I rolled over, told my wife, I said, I think I'm done. And she goes, what are you talking about? And as an, I think I'm retiring. And she started crying tears of joy because she wanted me to be done even before that. She don't know to sport or but what prime ages or not. And, uh, I hung them up and, and you know, over the years as we talked earlier, Herron who I would get the Itch, you know, and that could have been just going to the gym and Aetna are doing around on the pads, but I just didn't ever want it to keep doing it.

Speaker 2:          00:49:36       You know, my health, believe it or not is more important than anything else. Well that is something that every fighter has to consider. Like when have they fought too much? Yeah. How do you make that decision when your heart, when you lose it in here and that hard a little bit. It's a horrible hobby to have, especially at that high of a level. You know, cause you're not fighting guys that are getting off work at three o'clock and you know, you're fighting guys that are legit athletes and skilled professionals that fighting and um, it's dangerous. Unfortunately, we've seen, and no one we're talking about this, uh, with me getting the itch earlier, there's a lot of things I take in consideration. Like, I'm, I'm really intuit and I'm really debating on it and I'm hitting the gym work in boxing. Did I see things like this? A Donna Stevenson situation, you know, and those are the

Speaker 1:          00:50:27       things where I say, I got to sit back and talk to explain to people what happened. He just, he got hit and it was a good fight. He's been fighting for years now. One of the most feared fighters also in boxing. He fought the guy we were talking about earlier. Yeah. Uh, I can't pronounce his name. Um, I don't want to chop it up. Pull up the Russian gentleman's name. We, yeah, there's a way to say it. It's a, uh, better be, but I see them all at Donna Stevenson.

Speaker 6:          00:50:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:01       It's rushing cats. I have some crazy ass news, man. They do. I know. It's hard. You know, me being a guy involved in a sport and talking about it all the time to how hard it is for me. Yeah. To get it down. There's so many bad ass Russians these days. Okay. It's who Bostic. Yeah, it's GV. Oh, z. D y. K. But it's vas. Dick, you don't pronounce the G Wozniak. He sent me these two men. He's a beast. So in that fight again, Donna Stevenson is a brutal puncher, devastating knockout puncher. He's been fighting all these years now also. And this is the part that's the scary one on one, right? 41. Yes. And that's another situation or you know, factor factor where you might want to say, Hey, I'm done. Right. You know, even before this happened, unfortunately had to get to this point. But uh, he's in there and it's a fairly decent fight from what I was watching.

Speaker 1:          00:51:55       And next thing you know, he goes down at fights over and he dropped Fonzie kids at some point in the fight. He did. Yeah. And He, uh, next thing you know, he ends up in a coma, you know, fighting for his life to the sport. You never know. That's the scary thing about it. You know, you could get injured two weeks before the flight, the sparring, and have a little bleed that you would ever, no, no, no signs of it. And then the next thing you're, you're in a coma. Yeah. Well, I know that that really fucked up Roy Jones Jr when Gerald Mcclellan, who was his arch rival, you know, this was the guy that they thought one day he was going to fight when McAllen was killing it at light heavyweight and Roy was 168 pound champion. And then you know, to see mccloughan now you know, people who don't remember man McClellan was a fucking destroyer.

Speaker 1:          00:52:41       He was so God damn scary and so good and he hits so hard and he was the guy that, you know, Amusa Cronk fighter, you know, in the vein of Tommy Hearns and all those other great Cronk fighters and people looked at him like, man, one day that's going to be the fight. Him and Roy Jones Jr was almost like it was inevitable. Yeah. It was like Canelo and triple j or something. I know, cause everybody does the fantasy matchups and they asked me if I Pavlik Verse Michaela and I'm going, what are you guys trying to do to me? I don't want it that fight. You know what I mean? Cause he did it that hard. He was a brutal guy. Yeah. And then to see him when he fought Nigel Benn, same situation, lapse into that coma. We don't know how a dynasty Woodson is going to come out of this, but um, a lot of times when a guy does have a brain injury like that, like they're never the same again.

Speaker 1:          00:53:28       Yup. That's what I was saying. I like it could have happened that could have been something two weeks earlier that was never detected or signs of it. So it's scary. It is. Um, so you take that into consideration, but you also have that itch. Yeah. You know, and again, I, I'm 36, um, is is something that again, it's going to be a process of sitting down and discussing, you know, what he's going to, would you say you like 60% considering finding again maybe a little more right now? No, no, no. Ooh, I know. Um, do you ever like go back and watch like highlight reels and then you start shadowbox and again, itchy and really start thinking around it. And it's weird because I'm in my gym and, and there was people lifting weights and I'm in the back. I got a couple of bags back there.

Speaker 1:          00:54:13       And, um, you start hearing the bags popping in and everybody, they're not used to seeing it, so everybody gets curious and they come back and you see them like peeking around the corner and watching me hit the bag and then I get a little embarrassed. I'm like, all right. You know what? I'm just gonna, I'm gonna Chill with it right now. So, yeah, it's a, it's fun. It is. It's a thought again and we'll, we'll see. But the, a lot of that plays in my mind because the one thing is it becomes very selfish to, at a point, I got two young kids at home, you know, that's going to be 13 and 10. They're involved in sports and a lot of activities. They love me being around for it. And it don't take me half an a fighter. You sick, right. For something to happen.

Speaker 1:          00:54:54       You know what I mean? Um, but we'll, we'll toss it around and we'll, we'll see how that goes. Yeah, that's, um, that's a big consideration. There's a lot of things to factor in on that. Well, especially because you are busy now. And so what made you decide to do a podcast? Actually, I was excited when I heard you were doing that and I was like, all right. Yeah, you get into the podcast where I am, I'm looking at, you know, I hear some of these guys, uh, commentating and I say, I think I could do that. Yeah, you could do that. After listening and the podcast we're kind of throwing around. Um, I had, like I said, I got a handful of investments going on and I pick and choose on what I want to do and the podcast started off, uh, hey, let's have fun. Let's throw this podcast on. We'll get some cheap equipment. We know got a lot of followers on social media, so we'll do like the social media live and then we'll also hook it to the youtube and we're doing it. And it started off for a little wilder. Um, but no advertisement, it was kind of lonely.

Speaker 1:          00:55:54       You know, you're going, if you feel like I'm talking into a mic and nobody's there and then it started taking it, it's doing fairly well right now. It's how many downloads again, man, I'm right now the social media is the biggest. We ended up pitting. It reaches out after the first episode, you got 2000 people were reached and maybe like 400 views and then as the days go on and to share his go on, you started seeing it reaches out to over like 27,000 people and then you see, you know, uh, 8,000 views. So in, so on social media, Youtube is the one I'm working for, you know, really trying to push. And right now sometimes we get up 113 views on there and then sometimes I don't even want to mention how many dudes are on it. Uh, so again, it's a process with that.

Speaker 1:          00:56:40       Also, I know that I'm starting to learn that. Um, it's about consistency. That's the most important thing. But I get, I get out to these fights and people will know, you know who, who don't comment on a show because we do it words. It's live to format of it is to have everybody involved cause they liked that. They get ask questions and we're pretty much faces on the phone and reading the questions and answering it. And I think they liked that. And actually it's kind of funny because we'll get some great guests on there. We had Tj Dillashaw, we had Mikey Garcia, Terrence Crawford on how did you get out? I think you could bring back Joe Lewis and put them on there and people don't care about that. They want their questions answered, you know, through social media or through youtube and they kind of don't interact with the guests that you have one.

Speaker 1:          00:57:22       So it's, it's weird. Um, I think the format, I liked the format of it, but at the same time I wish people would be more involved with the guests that we have one. But for the most part it's fun. It's different. But that kind of format. It's well boxing fans in particular, well I should say just combat sports fans in particular. They'd love to comment on things. We'll have to get in on it. I mean, whenever there's a big fight, I mean social media just lights up both with boxing and with MMA. They live in La and the ability to go back and forth with the guy like you and get your questions answered and stuff like that. It's gotta be huge. Yup. And we tap in. We've had Matt Brown on so we tap into the UFC. I personally don't want to, cause I don't want to make nobody mad.

Speaker 1:          00:58:03       I don't know enough. I watch it and I couldn't get anybody mad. But I'm saying that some of the fans, you know, I would watch it, I enjoy it. But my now the Cohoes James Domingez, he's really big into that, you know? And he was the one that actually introduced me to Matt Brown and so he knows so on now show, that's where we work hand in hand together. Like he's able to do more of the questions. And I think it's fun when boxers don't know about him. A man they ass wonky questions. I know. That's how I felt with, you know, vice versa. So I'm sure man. Yeah, I'm sure like when you, when a big fight goes down and um, you uh, do, do you watch it and stream live? We do a, well we tried, we actually tried on that. That's a great idea for someone like you that we do a thing called the fight companion.

Speaker 1:          00:58:49       We do it all the time with, as a UFC fight, we'll put it up on that screen. We'll have a bunch of guys in here and we'll watch the fights and talk shit while the fights are going on and people play it alongside the commentary. So it's like they're watching the fights with us. Yeah, that's an idea. Thank you. That's great idea. Yeah, absolutely is. And that's the whole thing. We're just looking for different. Plus if you, if you go into the comments and start, you know, having people ask questions like, what do you think won that round? Then you go, this is why, you know, I think triple g one the round, this is why Canelo lost the round. Or this is why you could make an argument that canela wanted that, that kind of stuff for that kind of interaction stuff for the fans.

Speaker 1:          00:59:26       Love that. They love it. They love that. And that's it. That's what we're, you know, we're looking at different ideas to you cause you've never stopped learning. You can never stop, you know, expanding and doing things like that. So it's good. And you know, we get places, we get to these big fights and, and uh, people notice the show, you know, hey, I love your show. Even if they don't, you're saying that to me, you know? Um, yeah, it was a very keen insight. Right. Yeah. You know, and it was cool actually. What was that, the first triple g Canelo fight? You know, when I retired, I stayed away from boxing. I went to that, uh, I went there and I was all about promoting my podcast and, uh, it was kinda cool. I walked in there and everybody went crazy in the media room and I thought I was fighting again after we, after five years of being retired, I thought I was fighting.

Speaker 1:          01:00:16       I mean they were just asking and I was trying to squeeze stuff in and tell him what I was doing. And then it was cool also because Bernard Hopkins was there, you know, and I was just, I was already a year into the power lifting. I was still about two 30. And he came up and a, you gave me a big hug and you know, it was awesome to be able to after a fight and being able to go in there with him to see how nice he wasn't and how humble he was after that, you know, you could have been cocky. He could've walked past me and I said hi or recognize me at all. He was just really, uh, brought me in. So that's cool. Yeah. What did he say to you after the fight? Did he tell you need to box like a black guy?

Speaker 1:          01:00:56       I think he did. You know, after that fight, he could of told me everything he wanted and Rodica sat down for an hour with me and I wouldn't remember what he said. Um, I was, you know, everybody's seen the fight, so I don't, I mean, I need not to say much more on that, but, uh, he, a little bit of it because my trainer was there. It was, you'll keep your head up, you're a hell of a fighter, you know, and, and, you know, I'm experienced and go back, go back to the drawing board. Don't get too down on this and come back strong. He goes, you're a champ. And then that was what he's remember something where he said that you needed to learn how to fuck the black guy. I didn't hear that. I truly didn't, you know, and maybe he might've said that in an interview after with somebody and that's what people thought, but I know he didn't say it in a fight.

Speaker 1:          01:01:37       Yeah. Yeah. That was, um, that was, uh, was, you know, one of his best performances. I mean, he had so many great performances late in his career. The Tito Trinidad find in particular because nobody, nobody thought he was going to win that fight. That was, he was a big underdog in that fight. Trinidad was the up and coming rising Puerto Rican superstar was fucking everybody up and Bernard put on a show. I thought, you know, I actually had a Hopkins, the knife fight toe because he was just bigger, you know, the big guy, middle weight Trinidad's moving up. And uh, there was a lot of good middle waste side and think Trinidad was going to be, I think Trinidad was a amazing fighter by the kids. Great days. We're at one 47. Yeah. Grill. Yeah, I was, um, I mean he was a big puncher though. I mean he was a big puncher, even up into light heavyweight.

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       I mean you'd been into a little weight middleweight but he was, his style was almost tailor made for Bernard or no, I was so, so clever. It's such a good counter fighters. So good defensively. He didn't really open up, he didn't leave many openings. That goes back to the foot work that we were talking about. He noticed when he flat that fight, even when he fought me, but Trinidad and other guys, when they go to throw a punch, he take that one step in and kind of suffer Kate to punch. And especially if it was a straight right hand or did he would take that step and he would overthrow that overhand right and catch you what it, so he was really good at just putting a foot, not moving around, much putting in the right spot to hit you and counter you. Um, and he did that.

Speaker 1:          01:03:02       Trinidad was probably one of the best technically sound fighters ever. If you actually watch them, you know, the way to his punches. He'd never made mistakes on that part of it, but I think he needed a little bit more change it up a little different with Bernard Hopkins in order to have even made that fight kind of clothes. One of the most ridiculous turning that fights ever. Remember we fought Ricardo Mayorga and my org and let them punch him in the face. Yeah. He just put his hands down and go, go ahead and intense Trinidad teed off. I think he hit him with two left hooks on the chin. My role was crazy. He was so crazy. That was a crazy dude. Smoke cigarettes in between rounds and shit. I don't even know if I could believe that. I don't know if that was a show and he did that when the cameras are on because he was able to go a handful of rounds without getting tired.

Speaker 1:          01:03:42       Now I know if you smoke a cigarette man, that's going to take the wind out of you. Yeah, but you know, I know fighters that smoke. Yeah. Yeah. Joe Schilling, who's a worldclass kickboxer a top of the food chain world champion kickboxer smoke cigarettes. Well, crazy fucker man. I chewed most of my career. It's different though, right? It is. You know, chew nicotine restricts the oxygen in the blood and it's not good for a boxers or or anybody lifting weights. Nicotine does. Chewing Tobacco restore restricts the oxygen in the blood. I didn't know that, but can you pull it up? Just make sure just a stimulant though. You know, it's actually like for your brain. People say the a lot of folks I actually bought some, I never tried it but I bought some nicotine gum to try to see if I would write on it.

Speaker 1:          01:04:28       Like if it would help me writing. Like cause it apparently it works as a nootropic as a cognitive enhancer. Nicotine is actually an effective cognitive enhancer. I didn't know that. Maybe how much you take of it. The quantity. Yeah. I don't know. I mean I don't, I didn't know that it uh, it affects your, cause it's a stimulant. I didn't know that. It restricts the oxygen, your blood. That's pretty good from what I, from what I heard and chew actually more so than cigarettes because of the, uh, amount of nicotine on how it hits. It gets into the stream faster. But to me it was never, I didn't chew a day of the fight and I believe after so many hours, six to eight or 10 hours, um, it's out. So, but any of the, or it didn't affect me that stuff. So now cause I was able to run three miles and 19 minutes, 19 some minutes and five miles and 30 minutes. And, and uh, I was in, I was chewing it so it never really affected me.

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       Um, well maybe it did, but just you were in such good shape, shape, barely, no smoking on the other hand, lungs filling them. It is horrible. And uh, but after I retired and the itch wasn't there for like a year, I, I, I wanted to give the gums a break and I decided, well you know what else? Smoke and I quit smoking shortly. Started smoking cigarettes after you retire that Jesus Christ, I didn't want to start. Someone else starts at 30. I was switching out cause I, it was nicotine here. Oh here it is. Smoke tobacco, smokeless tobacco and health risks. Uh, but, but, but, but, but, but both the amount of nicotine in the bloodstream after using smokeless tobacco may be higher than that of a cigarette smoker. Okay. What does it say about oxygen now? That's where it was going into debt. This puts it all together.

Speaker 5:          01:06:07       The nicotine based is taking the place of the oxygen, I think is what the other, there's another, it's a less scientific paper, but nicotine stays in the blood stream longer with smokeless tobacco than cigarettes. Oral Tobacco causes heart disease. Okay. It's not a safe alternative folks. That's what it's saying. All right. We're [inaudible] bad for you. But you started smoking cigarettes. Yeah. Cause not because when you were smoking, when you drinking kind of guys that what it was? No, it was because I wanted, I liked the nicotine. Oh. And I chewed, you know, and uh, I wanted to give the gums or break the lips of break and I smoked. So I waited and have to chew and uh, doing the lifting and power lifting. I went over and I think I've got seven squats and I couldn't breathe Jesus. And I said, you know what?

Speaker 5:          01:06:56       This is a shame. How long have you been smoking for? I was only eight months. Several months. That's long enough on it, you know. And uh, yeah, I said, you know what, cause I had no plans coming back to the ring. I didn't. So I was done and uh, yeah, I got to seven, seven reps into the squat and I was like, you know, this is a sad, that was a former, you know, world class athlete. So I, I was done right after that day, but to cigarettes back. I'm a good for you. Yeah, I'm sad you started it up, but glad you figured out to let it go. Yes. You that's a, that's a weird choice though at 30. Yeah. I'm just cause smoking bull is nicotine, you know, and that's what a lot of people do. When I tried to quit, uh, the children, they, they, they go over to the smoke and then just go to the gum.

Speaker 5:          01:07:42       Usually you could do that too, but some people would just like it. Um, yeah. I don't know what it does. It does juicy up. Tony Hinchcliffe a smoked cigarettes. He doesn't anymore, but he used to and a couple of times I took a cigarette from him and smoked it before I went onstage and he's like, dude, you're going to get hurt. He was worried about me. You're going to get hurt. I'm not going to get hooked. Yeah. I'm just going to smoke this one cigarette. I'm not going to go buy a pack. But people are so scared of it. Yeah. Well I see why though. Yeah. You know, especially again, you know, as I'm mentioning, I'm over. I used to be able to do all that and then I do seven reps on a

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       squat night and I'm having a hard time breathing and, uh, I racked it. Now granted we're, squats are hard though. I mean, you're going to, if you're spending on a weight and how many reps you're doing, it's a different type of exercise. But you know, I, I was done after that. So you had a drinking thing for a while too, Huh? Yeah. That's, that's one that, uh, that gets a lot of fighters. Yeah, it does. Um, but it's one that, you know, on that, that it ticks me off and it don't, it ticks you off. Yeah. How so you'd, a lot of it was ran through to the hometown, you know, and the troubles that I, that I got in with the, um, TMZ, stuff like that, you know, the incidents that happened were petty small. And if it was, it wasn't in Youngstown, it would've never made news stuff that kind of happens.

Speaker 2:          01:09:14       Shit. Bb guns and in a four wheeler. Yeah, I shot a kid. We were playing around. I was taking care of them. And this is the truth of the story taking care of them. I was putting a, a big lake in my backyard and uh, I got the country boy. I mean, I went out and rented two excavators and some bobcats and started putting, uh, the ponded this, uh, this guy I was helping out. He knows how to run the excavators. So I, he needed work. He had no money. I was taking care of him and his kids over at the house. He's, he's working. So long story short, after about five days, I'll come home and he's in the pond or lake just in his underwear playing around. I grabbed the BB gun. I'm joking around with him, you know, cause we were shooting targets for a couple of days in between work and I shoot him in the, uh, on the arm for 42 years old at the 41 years old at the time too.

Speaker 2:          01:10:09       So it wasn't a kid. He gets out, he's like, yeah, you shot me. And, and uh, he's crying about it and everything else. And next thing you know, he, he's cool though. He gets out of these, it's on Facebook and he's Giggling, laughing about it and he stays at my house that night. His kids come over, I'm feeding them, we're having cookouts the next day, a little things. I don't know that I'm glad that I'm not involved in no more or I don't put myself in a situation. So He's, he stays for two days after that at my house. And uh, his uncle comes there who worked for the sheriff, the local sheriff's department, and it goes, hey, is so and so here? And I said, yeah, he was, I haven't seen him. No. And he goes, okay, listen. He goes, Kelly, I'm coming here to tell you.

Speaker 2:          01:10:54       So I way the news, the media, everything else don't come. He has a warrant out for his arrest and tell him, you know, if he comes back, call us. So he leaves, I go walk it through the house and they come. Brian comes down the steps and I was like, dude, you gotta get the Hell Outta here. I was like, I didn't know anything about this. You having a warrant, blah blah, blah. He goes over and pass out on my couch. I call his uncle, hey, you want him? He's here. So he finds out, he ends up running out of the house and they catch him, you know, that night or whatever, they take him in, he does two months and a county jail, gets out, takes his uniform off, walks over to the sheriff's department. Sheriff's department and presses. Charges on you. Yes. For shooting him with a BB gun.

Speaker 2:          01:11:44       Yes. And a buddy of mine who was there when it happened was video in it. His girlfriends laughing in the background, you know when it happened. But that was, it was just a video of it happening. He'd sold it to a TMZ and next thing you know, I ended up getting served or what not. My attorney calls me also and it says, Hey, go down, turn yourself in. You know, it's a federal assault charge. Yeah. Kinds of federal assault. Yes. Yeah. And uh, that was it. And again, it was all over money. It was a drawn out case. I'm supposed to have been beat and it turned to that over a BB gun but a guy and he said it was an assault. So I always trying to get from you. You got nine grand and it was supposed to, when he filed a civil suit or a couple months into this, the criminal charges are supposed to be dropped at that point because prosecutor and everybody knew that it was all about money. So today we're going to drop the criminal charge. They never did. And uh, it goes back in Youngstown, you know, I was out in the public eye and someone that people would eight, they had it out. They have

Speaker 4:          01:12:57       to for people to understand how big star you are in Youngstown. I mean, I remember at the time, I remember reading stories, seeing news clips mean Youngstown's not a big place and other than ray boom, boom, man seen. He's not a whole lot of like really famous people, especially fighters had come at a young sound, but you were a fucking giant celebrity in that.

Speaker 2:          01:13:15       Yeah. And that was Kinda my, my bad on that. That's where I think the, the fault was probably hard for you to recognize. You're not even 30 years old. Yeah. All this shit is going on. Yeah. And it's true. And I'm not looking for that as an excuse. You know when I say it, but it is true. I looked, I looked at myself as everybody else. Right. I think that was the issue

Speaker 4:          01:13:36       you hadn't recognized yet that you're in some weird place. We have to watch what you,

Speaker 2:          01:13:40       I felt like if I go to the bar and somebody goes, boy you Kelly public's been here three days. He's a lush. My argument was I got every right to be here just like you do. Matter of fact, I have more of a right. You know, I'm retired. I've got my money put away, you're probably drinking your weekly pay away. That was my, my thought processes, thought process of that and it was probably wasn't right. You know, because it comes down to is you are a big fish in a little pond and it's a small city and I think that by being out there, I brought a lot on myself because of that. It is what it is. Unfortunately as an athlete you, you can't do that. And um, so that happened over a period of time and the word got around and a lot of anger, you know, you have some jealous, some angry, there's some who just didn't like me.

Speaker 2:          01:14:32       So just so much fun for them to gossip. Yeah, exactly. Cause what else is really not beating up young song. I love it. It made me who I am. But if you really look up young Saunders not drained a lot to talk about besides the fact that we do put out the most NFL players per capita. Really? Oh absolutely. Youngstown does. Why is that you think? I don't know. Is Averages there? Just some, some bad ass dudes from, from Youngstown. And it is, I don't, I don't know why, I mean, even the boxing part of it, if you truly break down the five rural champs from such a small city and 36 years as, as it came up with the other world champs besides the [inaudible] area, royal actually held the title in the same way class Ron, the same exact time that Massey and he did, he had Jeff Lampkin, uh, Greg Richardson.

Speaker 2:          01:15:19       And uh, then you had a handful of other guys like Roland Cummings and fighters out there that were making noise out of Youngstown. A guy can say granny who fought Chavez and Comacho out of Youngstown. But, um, being at being at being there like that, it brought a lot of attention and people wanted, wanted, you know, and there was a lot of angry people. Was it weird growing up there and then becoming a famous guy there? Yeah, it is. Because again, you know, you don't, people will tell you, hey, when you get to that level, when you wouldn't have rolled title, Shit's going to change man. And you're going, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. You think, you know, right. Like you're going, yeah, I got what you're saying. And then it happens and you win it. And it's so true when they say overnight, like you're not, you know more, you know, like you're, you can't be yourself no more.

Speaker 2:          01:16:09       It's a everything changes and it comes down to the person. Even though if you don't want to change and you like living your life the way you did two days ago, uh, fortunately you can't, you know, and it's, it's a hard, and it's something that you got to learn how to deal with. And that, that wasn't my choice though. You know what I mean by that? My choice wasn't to go out and act like a jack alone. My choice was kind of just be me though. And um, you just did what you wanted to do. I did. And then it just became a big issue because you were a famous guy. Yes. And the, another issue on top of that came to was where I could actually take the blame for this. And, and I honestly cam a lot of it came down to, and everybody's different. So I'm not, I'm speaking for myself. I trained my ass off when I trained, you know, I was a six, seven hours a day type guy and uh, that's what got me to throw as many punches as I did around, you know, and I was in great shape

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       for every fight. I sacrifice a lot of things. I gave up a lot, you know, I'm even starting from high school, you know, being an amateurs and just turning pro right out of high school. I missed a lot of things. My mentality was when, you know, I had time, I was going to, I was going to live, I was going to live like my friends who were 19, 20, 21, 24 and that was the process of it. Um, I do believe though, at a point, especially after I retired, that it got a little, got a little out of hand. Absolutely. You know, and I'm not going to be the person to sit her and say, you know, it did, I'm not naive enough to say that. Well, you know better than anybody, but the rumors were always that you were drinking a lot, but, and that was affecting your career.

Speaker 1:          01:17:56       It may have to at some point. I don't think it did. People say, use the fact that Hopkins beat me and that was this. That was the reason. And that's why I retired so young and it wasn't, it truly wasn't. Um, maybe some of the stuff I was doing, especially as I got older in between flights to drinking, I think that that could have, that may have heard a little bit. I don't think it was enough to make any significant changes in my career, to be honest with you. Um, but you know, who knows what that, if I didn't, we'll never know. Um, again, but I lived up and do I got anything to regret about it? No. Do you still live in Youngstown? Yeah, we're on the outside in the suburbs. You know, is it, I mean, it's gotta be strange to have grown up there, been a child there, and then become an internationally famous world champion boxer and celebrity and still stay there.

Speaker 1:          01:18:48       Yeah. It's the world changes and you're still Kelly Pavlick and I think after I retired, as far as some of the mistakes I've come to where I should have gotten out, maybe come out here to California or go to a on. Yeah, right. I don't, yeah, we're working on it. Plenty of room. Yeah. Just had that last night. What my, uh, manager, uh, mark he was telling me, talking about you doing out here. Can you say he's throwing around ideas also again, we were talking about what we have talked about earlier, but to fight coming back, uh, we talked about the dancing with the stars. Things. Is that some ideas he's looking into? Also sponsorships, um, you know, again, mark is, um, got a lot of connects. He's in that industry. Boxing's in an interesting place right now and I'm really, I was really bummed out that uh, HBO canceled their boxing series.

Speaker 1:          01:19:39       I mean, after how many years? It's 40, 43 years. Something crazy like that. They put on some of the all time. Great classic fights. And, you know, I think Jim Lampley, one of the best commentators of all time, I loved hearing Roy Jones Jr do it and Andre Ward and she, you know, I just, Max Kellerman was amazing. I just, I just can't believe that it's over. I mean, not, I don't know, I guess it wasn't profitable for them or they just decided to get out of the, I really don't understand it. I don't believe that it's going to be gone for long from Hbo. I, yeah, I have for some reason, I think you noticed, uh, Lampley still has the fight game. That was an error in her donut. Um, I heard rumors of maybe Roy Jones taking it over, buying it out or somebody buying. Yeah. Um, but a big issue I think where that, what happens in to HBO and showtime is doing very well right now.

Speaker 1:          01:20:33       Yeah. And I don't know yet. I'm not sure if we'll ever fall into this situation that HBO did, but you have these apps coming out now. Espn plus a disowned DAZN. And again, like what they just had that signing what Canelo how big that was. The richest athlete, you know, the biggest contracts, $150 million or something for, I thought it was three 65 and some Canelo's how much money if something, I think it was 365 million, but he, there was also per, you know, incentives and everything else but that, so 365 and it was a six in there. That's a lot of fucking money. Yes it is for I think 11 fights or whatever. It was crazy. And um, so again, that's where these people were coming to this ESPN plus tig. They could wash these fights. Now on these four, seven, nine, nine, nine, nine 99 a disown has UFC or MMA fight bar, I think it's spelled tour fights, whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:21:27       It is nice that ESPN is putting on a lot of fights now. Exactly. They also now have a deal with the UFC. So, uh, into 2019 now the first UFC event, it's going to be January 19th, which is Tj Dillashaw versus Henry Cejudo for the flyweight title. And they're really putting on some great fights on ESPN. It's just exciting just to see MMA being recognized, be ESPN. But it's exciting to see ESPN put like Llama Chanko fights on. Exactly. Cause Espn used to be kind of more so the prospects you can go to Friday night fights where are the up and coming guys and they were, they were putting out on and that was great for the prospects. I think they need to actually keep doing that maybe on a different night. But now they're putting the loan with Cenk goes and we're putting in a rural class fighters on ESPN Crawford's last fight on ESPN I believe it was.

Speaker 1:          01:22:10       You know, that's awesome. That's awesome. Yeah. So that and that APP that ESPN plus like I'm saying, so there's more accessibility to that and people would rather pay that then order to 69 or 89 or $100 paper review funds. Right. Seven bucks a month is nice. It is. I mean with the UFC, the UFC has a UFC fight pass and you know they have events just constantly same sort of deal and that's great for that. It is because it's easier route, you know, outlet for it. Yeah. And you can watch on your phone on, on a train. Exactly. It's like the, the world's changing and now also, I love the fact you could stream it from your phone, right. To your television and you got a smart TV. You can watch it. Exactly. Yeah. You know, I was even thinking about that at my gym because I know how it is.

Speaker 1:          01:22:55       What business in ordering paper view fights. There was actually a funny story about that and Youngstown with that too. Um, where everybody thought it was my fault. But uh, yeah, you could get that and I got to have 40 people there on a big fight night, UFC fight night or a boxing fight night and I could just put that phone right up to the smart TV. We could watch it on there instead of paying, don't say this, don't say this right now. They're going to come get you. Oh yeah. You're not going to do that. This is all hypothetical. This will never happen. You're not going to do that. Right. Thought it was leaving. No, I'd be legal. Yeah. Well the UFC is gone after people in the past for illegally streaming things and then showing them on television. Oh, well I thought if you had the APP, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:23:35       I don't know how to be honest when you're showing it on a, in a business, because I know what I was talking about earlier, what the young style thing that happened, it was kind of funny was um, they were getting the fights, the paper view of fights and they were, some of the businesses were illegally getting it and AOL got fine. They were going around and people were actually coming to me like, I have something to do with it. They were like, I can't believe you'd do that. You should have to pay us like $3,000 for to find out what you got. And I'm going, yes. I started googling, I'm going, last time my mind was, I was worried about was who was ordering fights in Youngstown. What I'm hearing, you know, Atlantic City or Vegas right now fighting, um, getting ready to try to make weight and doing the interviews and the press conference.

Speaker 1:          01:24:24       And everything else. What kind of asshole says that you should have hit? It kind of came out in one. Actually, my brother was doing, uh, going to get ads for the program from places and they're like, I'm not giving, I'm not putting an ad and he costs me $3,000. You know, you cost you, you fucking pirate. I, he might nighties and I'm sure I'm not just using that with the young side. That would probably would have happened anywhere, you know, small, small area. So while, you know, illegal streaming, if they don't do something about it, man, uh, it would run rampant. I just don't know what the thing to do. That's correct is, you know, I've seen some outrageous fines. I don't know. You know, and as you, as we just have about what happened earlier, we don't know what's, what's legal and what's not either or anymore with all the different, uh, Internet stuff and apps that you have. And it was a smart TVs with TVs. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, or, you know, can you stream it on your phone and have a bunch of people look over your shoulder? Yeah. How's that work for you? If you have a smart TV though, you know, like if you have it on your phone and then like 20 of your friends come over and they're behind you. Yeah. And you say, hey man, everybody give me a dollar.

Speaker 1:          01:25:31       He get in trouble for that and I was at work or that could be a great idea. It's not the worst idea. But yeah. The, how does that work? Because with Apple TV, anything you're watching, you can watch a youtube video and you just stream it to that TV with a, you know, a quick swipe and oppress Bam. Yeah. Yeah. I think the move for them is to make it easily accessible. Like a WWE was the first one to figure that out. Right. They, they figured out how to, you get like a monthly subscription and you get to watch all the events and then the UFC did that with fight pass and ESPN plus doing this and you, he knows how to make the money. Yeah. We could all see. Sure. Um, you know, I think it was also great as somebody who's insights station, you know, local stations and inside putting these fights on also like they used to do back in the day, you know what, ABC fights and uh, oh it was a CBS sports.

Speaker 1:          01:26:20       Yeah, yeah. All that shit do not again, you know, why, why wouldn't us? It's great for the sport and you know, that's how you get people involved back in it. You know, it's almost like almost every other generation or, or, or, or every other decade there was that group of fighters that come out, you know, he like the Frazier guys like that. Then you had like the Tyson holy filled Reddick bow, but you also, at that time it was easy and it was accessible to, to watch all the time. Now, you know, it's not even the apps, which is I think is great. You get a lot of guys in their forties and fifties who don't want to have to watch an APP on your TV. So I think if they start bringing it back up, just a little more variety of, uh, shows or something. Well, it seems like, especially with boxing right now, the talent level is extremely high.

Speaker 1:          01:27:11       I mean it is with them, I may as well. But I mean with boxing it seems to be on an upswing. And it also seems like people really interested in some of these big rivalries like triple g and Canelo. That was two amazing fights. I thought the first one was a robbery. I thought that a triple g one the first one, but they don't fight again. Really? Yeah. Why is that? Because, uh, when you get a guy that hits as hard as triple g does and you get a guy that's as good as Canelo, you know, and, and they're, and there, even though they're not getting dropped and are not getting knocked out, the dumb type of flights take a lot out of you. They really do. And they shared a lot in those two fights and we don't know, even right now if the next fight or to fight after that Canelo start showing somebody effects from those first two fights.

Speaker 1:          01:27:56       You think so? Yeah. You get a guy that hits two guys that hit that hard and earned her fighting like that, eventually it does drain you a little bit and that will catch up. I think a third fight we'll shorten the career of Canelo. I'm not going to say triple g because triple g is my age now and I, I have a feeling that his might be getting short here pretty soon anyways, just due to age. But Canelo I mean that, that's, it was a brutal fights. They were brutal fights. Did you think that um, some people thought that triple g one, the second fight as well. I thought it was much closer. Fine done the first fight. But did you think that Canelo triple g, I think Conello showed some improvement, but it's also possible that triple g might've slowed down a little bit.

Speaker 1:          01:28:36       I think so. Um, you know, the first fight I had at nine 30 for triple g that's how I spent sounds about right. Yeah. And I gave the first three rounds to Canelo and then I had every round after for triple g this fight, I thought Canelo one close fight. And if you gave it to triple g, I wouldn't have screened where are bright. You know, teddy was saying that he thought the triple g one, but, um, I felt like, well it's a pretty close fight pretty close by, but certainly Conello showed much improvement. He did and he fought a better fight. The first half of the fight I gave a keynote a lot of eyebrows because I thought he controlled the fight with the two body shots. Everybody thought triple g was controlling it with the jab, but the reason why it triple g wasn't using his size and strength was because it was using his jab was cause of the body shots that Canelo was landing.

Speaker 1:          01:29:23       I mean, they were brutal. And, uh, I just thought Canelo dictated the pace of those first couple of rounds. I thought he won enough of the early rounds and obviously triple g one the second most of the second half of the fight, but I thought it was a little too late, you know, and I had Canelo up by around her too. Yeah. Um, it's, it's just one, those are, those are two fighters that really sort of epitomize, uh, what people like to see when they like to see like these classic rivalries, right? Like a guy like triple g who's just forward pressure, constant throwing bombs, knockout puncher or garlic Canelo who's just one of those classic Mexican fighters that as incredible heart wants to fight the best of the best, like really like really takes it in the first fight. Yeah. Yeah. It's the on the ropes with triple g and let him, let him use that power to beat your organs.

Speaker 1:          01:30:16       Then Pardot sites, you know, I was sitting, I'm going, I'm not wanting to talk. I, I kinda like getting in and getting involved myself with guys, especially like Miranda who I personally believe it harder than a triple g really? But yeah. And I was a guy in there, but that was my strategy as we're Canelo. I wasn't, I really wasn't a great strategy, you know, I didn't lay on the ropes and let them around. Uh, do you think he just didn't know what to expect until he was in there with triple gene? It could have been because everything changes. Like I think Mike Tyson said it, you know, everybody's got a game plan until they get hit. Uh, he might've got touched, like I said, even what the tension and that Mayweather fight and the whole brain might have just started going a thousand miles an hour trying to figure out, okay, like this ain't going to probably work tonight with this guy because he's a lot stronger than I expected.

Speaker 1:          01:31:03       And he was just trying to maybe tire them out. The only issue is now you're, when you're on the ropes like that and you're getting hit by a guy that hits that hard and adults in the elbow and the forearms and to the body, and then you're, you're tightening up and you're tensing up really hard and you're cutting the oxygen off to the blood. It tires you out quicker and it wears you down. You know, more than what he was doing in the middle of the ring by pop shot and, and, and counter punching. And he could have dictated how fast he wanted. You know, how much you wanted to punch all hard. He wanted to punch. Yeah. We certainly made some big improvements in that second fight. Yeah. Do you, um, you, you, you really don't want to see them fight a third time? I truly don't. I mean if it happens, I'm going to watch it, you know, but they're going to fight. Right. I mean Canelo's obviously going to fight some people and triple g is obviously going to continue fighting. You don't, and again, I don't know how long triple g's going to fight because as you mentioned, and I agree with you, um, I think he's starting to, his age is showing up a little bit with him. Wow. I, he,

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       he got avoided by a lot of people and we, you know, when he had a paper view a couple of years back that only got 150,000 buys. And I remember thinking that is a damn shame damn shame that people don't realize that this is absolutely one of the best fighters ever. I was surprised by that too, cause I think he's a lot more popular than what those numbers show. I didn't get it. I don't understand. I mean I don't, maybe it's because they didn't think the fight was competitive. Maybe. I mean, maybe I don't know what it was, but it just, it seemed like, I just think personally myself, there's a lot of flights out there for Canelo. He just went up to one 68. Yeah. I'm not a big fan of that. I think he's too small for 16. I do. Especially if you get in with the right flight or I truly do believe that, you know, everybody, how tall is easy?

Speaker 5:          01:32:47       Five ten five, nine, five 10. Um, but you know what, boxing or like football, when you see the height, you always got to take an inch, inch and a half off to, so how did they lie? Had me list is six three I'm right under six. Two by like that much. So it's kind of like the football program and high school. Right, right, right. But um, Canelo I think that there's guys out there staying at 68. It's kind of dangerous. I think he's great and I'll tell it to enough to keep good fights out there. Yeah. But it's a little dangerous in my opinion. I think it 68 could cause problems for them. You got even the guys like Zardoz Benevidez those are dangerous fights. Just them two guys right there. I would have to take not so much overall skill wise, just size and being at that weight and you know, um, you got guys coming down like be evil from one 75 to one 68.

Speaker 5:          01:33:36       I think that his better days are going to be at one 60. You know, does he have a hard time making 60 or do you just have an opportunity to fight 68 and he took it, I think it's the trophies, you know, and I don't blame him for that and either he had the right flight to go up to one 68 so we'll get another weight division under his belt. Yeah. He knows tuning in that dude up and I think that would be what, three now? He's a three week class champ. Yeah. And uh, so that, it looks good on paper when you retire. Yeah, it does. I would have done it if I could have, you know, if there, if there was the right fights out there. But when he fought Mayweather Mayweather, it made them cut down to what, 52 was it something like that.

Speaker 5:          01:34:12       I think the idea there were how to catch weight around that, you know, um, that fight was to me, while it was a good learning experience for him to be in there with a guy who was as slick as Floyd is, but also a good learning experience. So you're not supposed to suck that much weight out of your body. Just he didn't have the fire. No. Even though you have a 24 hours or however long it is to try to rehydrate, that's never enough time to recoup. Yeah. So your, your thing is you're just hoping your opponent's going through the same thing that you are, you know, that's what it comes down to. What I do like about boxing that is missing in MMA is more weight classes. I really think that, and that's one of the things that people have a problem with inboxing. They think there's too many weight classes. I don't agree with that. I think if anything, there's too many world champions. I think it's ridiculous that in

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       any organization that one guy could be a WBC world champion. The other guy could be a waa. There's an Ibf is the WBO. I mean like that's crazy. It's crazy to have that many world champions. It should be a world champion. But how do you decide what organization is the real sanctioning body while you just need one sanctioning body? Uh, I don't know how you would do that either because it's all money. You know what I mean? There are so corrupt. Yeah. It's all money is hard to do that. I, I see your point on that a little bit. And then I also look at like, you got so many guys that are so good. Yeah. And boxing is a short window. So like how long can you stay on to it until you finally get that chance to fight the top guy? Top Dog.

Speaker 1:          01:35:41       And anything can happen in boxing too, you know? Uh, I, I kinda like, I may maybe knock it down at three, but I think when you have the different way classes, now you got four people just say one person has each belt, you got four world champs, now you're looking at these four guys and you can start taking these price prospects. And I started saying this will be an interesting fight with this guy and this guy and then I, I do believe that they should make, make happen one undisputed champ. Yeah, I believe so too. I think that should happen in every week class. They should have a fight off or a box off and a four champions or you know, maybe that way keep the prospect's in line and have the four champions fight off, you know, who's the undisputed champion and then your prospects get your shot.

Speaker 1:          01:36:24       You know, it just seems weird to have more than one world champion. You're either the world champions like how many guys won the Superbowl this year? How many teams? One. One, it should be one. No, can't have multiple world champion. Like when Anthony Joshua was walking around as a heavyweight champion, but also Deontay wilder is walking around is the heavyweight champion. Like what, what is this? Are you the heavyweight champion or you the champion of the organization that falls into like what kind of, again, what we were talking about earlier with the Jermaine Taylor thing when he vacated the belts. Okay. Yeah. In my mind you want the unified ton of fire or universal recognizable the ring middleweight title because where does the lineal begin? When does it not? And I had to ring title. So usually in most cases during cuddle is undisputed or Lenneal champ, just so in other words, d Champa that way class, you know, it's something, but for the most part, you know, who is the champion of a weight class?

Speaker 1:          01:37:17       Well, ring magazine's title is almost as valuable as anybody else's. That's one. And that's the one that I really showcase when I show people my my case. You know, it's so classic too with like the, the stripes and I think rocky really did a lot for it. I bought two. I do. That's true. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it's a classy look at belt, you know, and everybody else has got the big ones with the leather and the strap like the ring magazines. A nice one. Yup. I wanted to belts, you know, I didn't want to pay to sanction and fees for all four to belts, but I wanted to, I still wanted to Ibf and a WPA and um, you don't have to put in the trophy case, but uh, fortunately lot of fights filter when you were up, um, when you were a kid and you're watching boxing where Yo Hagler fan, I was a Hagler Fan, but you know, that's another one that's actually where we may even have them guys like Manzini in a Roya from Youngstown and guys like that.

Speaker 1:          01:38:09       I had never really had this one person that I was like, or a poster in my bedroom, you know, like deloit or something. You never had one guy that like you emulated or you were really little. I emulated everybody and I think that's what helped me get to this far as I did in my career. I mean, even when I was 16, I could watch a nine year old sparring and see him do something cool. It hit a guy and I'd be like, Damn, you know, I'm going to try that. That, that actually might work. I followed it and I was just a big fan of the sport overall. Of course I had guys that like, like God, he, because of his style coming up and de la Hoya Sugar Ray Leonard in my opinion, is probably the one of the best fighters pound for pound of all time.

Speaker 1:          01:38:45       Um, and it's arguable. I mean if somebody says May, whether I'm not going to say one of the best for sure. Yeah. I'm not going to say you're stupid for having a number one. It's a great debate. Um, but yeah, so I followed it more as a fan, you know, and I watched and I took from this person I took from that person. We have, as I mentioned, we have some prospects in the amateurs coming up that train in the same gym and I would kind of copy their style, you know, coming up. So I was always trying to keep learning. Like I even doing, working out now I find different things that work, you know, and what don't work. And uh, that's what I did as far as box. And I just watched guys I heroin there, I have a copy for like two days de la Hoya style, you know, he'd be there with their hands up and picking them off with the hands.

Speaker 1:          01:39:26       I go to [inaudible]. I didn't try it in a fight. I did it in sparring and I will copy his style a little bit to see how it works or how I could add it to my arsenal. So yeah, I was just asking about Haggar because he's sort of the quintessential middle weight champion. You know, there's like a few guys that you look back in the day and you look at who were just iconic middleweight champion your guys in your late forties and 50s. Okay. They'll argue with you that he was the best middle weight of all time. He certainly was one of them. Yeah. And you'll have, you'll have your guys that, you know, have Hopkins. Uh, so that's, that's what I'm saying, like even the heavyweights, you got your holders. Oh, Joe Muhammad Ali was the best. Then you have your guys and early forties told you that Mike Tyson.

Speaker 1:          01:40:08       So it's kind of like whoever grew up on that. Me Personally, you've got to get past that because again, that becomes biased and everybody's going to kind of go with what they grew up with. Um, there was a lot of greats. Sure. Well, people sleep on Lennox Lewis. He was, you know, when you talk about the greats all time, great heavyweight boxers, like how the fuck do you not include Lennox Lewis this size, the size, the power. Know. How do you not put Evander Holyfield you do, you know guys that beat Tyson, the crazy Riddick Bowe I mean, we're way smaller than when I was a helping Arrow called heavyweights right there. Crazy era. Yeah, it was the nineties. Right. And those are the ones, when you say heavyweight division, those were the fighters, you know, but it's, how long ago was that now? You know, a long time. Some years. And uh, so it don't around enough.

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       Well, what I'm hoping is more emerging town in the heavyweight division. We'll sort of take a little bit of this spotlight that you're seeing now that's going on fury and wilder and Joshua and I'd like to see and you know, a little bit of our teas. I like to see more guys get in the mix there and have it be like it used to be back then where there are a bunch of like really exciting contenders. He looked forward to these big fights because right now there's like four guys, five, six guys at most that are going to fight each other.

Speaker 5:          01:41:22       Exactly. And you know, hopefully what it does is it gets these other bigger, bigger guys. He's at the athletic athletes and, and uh, skilled athletes. It hopefully it brings him into the boxing again. Did I? Did I remember this is David tool making a comeback? I hope not. Seriously. How old is he? Shit. He gotta be mid forties dude. He was 46 want, maybe it's not, did I make that up that he's making a comeback? I'm looking to, he was a fucking monster. Fortunately in the heavyweight division, he probably could get away with that f 46 I might be able to. He was a god Damn Monster. Uh, well he was short. He was, he was a hard guy to fight. He was one of them guys that low to the ground. Thick, bigger legs. No neck. Brutal power. Yeah. Good left hook. Yeah. Yeah. He's the one who guides you didn't want to fight even if you were Lennox Lewis, his height.

Speaker 5:          01:42:16       Remember when he knocked out John Ruiz? Yeah. It was brutal. Yeah. No, he was an animal man and he could take a shot too. Remember when he fought a I? Kobe a Buchi who was the only guy to go the distance with a bay of Gucci. I was another big, he was a scary motherfucker. Yeah. And what did he went to jail for? Like sexual assault or something crazy like that. He was in jail for a long time. We were just talking about another guy to kind of remind me of the Ummah. Samuel. Peter's another. Oh yeah, neck thick. Yeah, he was my, I actually, I trained with him a little bit out a top ranks gym. Um, when we were fighting. He was actually a really cool guy, you know, and it was a big fan of mine too, so it was kind of neat to be able to share it out with him and you know, talk with them before we started training.

Speaker 5:          01:42:57       That's cool. That's cool. And Bay of Gucci, I think. I want to say that he's getting out soon. He was in jail for all long time and apparently there was some article that I read a couple of years back that he was planning on making a comeback when he gets released. But again, he's deep into his forties as well. And it's hard to make it come back and no matter if it's heavy weight or not at that level, you don't have to be an hour. I tell people all the time with even young kids that are 21 and 22 when it, sometimes these promoters, freezer contractors is a dispute going on and they sit out two years. Sometimes they may not ever come back fully from that. You know what I mean? It's true. Especially at that high of a level, you know, in boxing. Did Mikey Garcia have a contract as you did time?

Speaker 5:          01:43:42       Yeah, and I was concerned about that when he came back. You know, I was, I was concerned about how much damage that time off could have done. How long was this contract as people, I think it was two over two years for a top level fighter like him. That's a disastrous is and you know, but Mikey on the other hand is a genius and a ring and he just, he has that going for him, you know? And uh, he also could fight, you know, does he's been doing it since he was so young and being in a family. I think the cake came out to Boone with boxing gloves on. So there's so many good fights to be made right now. It's just a, it's a really exciting time. It's just a really, really exciting time, which is, you know, another reason why I'm bummed out that HBO got out of the game.

Speaker 5:          01:44:24       I would like to see HBO come back. I mean do you notice talks of it and uh, I think it would be great for the sport. Again, if it came back as big as it did now don't get me wrong towards the end. And it was kind of hard to watch with some of the fights they had on in my opinion. You know, it just weren't interesting. They weren't big fights. Um, you know, and I think that was a funding thing. Like they didn't have enough of a budget that, or I think they knew longer that day was so they were on the way out. Yeah. And saved them money. You know, I don't know how many subscriptions they lost from that. I, I don't know if it hurt or what, but I asked why I say I, if they're keeping the fight game open, an Arrow showing that I see coming back, especially if showtime stays with the boxing and doing as big as they are in a box office with the, the numbers I see Hbo, I think it would have to come back.

Speaker 5:          01:45:13       Well, I think with things like Netflix and Amazon prime, they're, they're making these television shows now that are so popular and they, there's such high budget, but you get things like game of Thrones cost so much money to make, but so many people watch it. I think they're concentrating on those kind of things cause they're so profitable. And I don't think it's the networks anymore. I got worry about shutting down to with all these other, uh, Zulu and, and Amazon and Netflix being out, you know, I think some of the, eventually somebody cable companies are going to have to worry. Yeah. You know, I'm sure. Yeah. It seems like, you know, it's, we're entering into a new era of entertainment technology and the advancement of it, you know, again, these apps people, I think that ESPN plus had over 7 million some a subscribers when it came out because of the boxing and everything else and that, that does own does the u s or you know, flights on there and uh, boxing.

Speaker 5:          01:46:08       So you're going to have these coming out and people were going to get into it. And it's, it's changing. It's changing a lot. Well, they're doing Beltour fights. They're doing a lot of fights on disown. Right? Yeah. Yeah. It's, um, it's very exciting time. You thought about you, you were saying, talking a little bit about commentary. If you thought about doing commentary. I have, have you ever done any of it? No. No, no. But, uh, I would like to, you know, honestly, I, I would, uh, I not knocking anybody. I may not be the best talker in the road either, but I listened to some of the guys on there and I'm like, I think I could do that. You know, listen, I know you can do it. You definitely do it. Um, but to me it adds a certain element when a real world class, um, is breaking down situations cause you're getting to see it from their perspective of how they would approach it.

Speaker 5:          01:46:55       It's not just a guy who's a boxing experts, a guy who did it, who did it. Yeah. A guy who was a world champion like Andre Ward. Like when Andre Ward's on, I fucking love that guy as a commentator. Yeah. All is good to Paulie's Andrei. And Pauline is mal analogies. One of my favorites. He's excellent. Damn that motherfucker talks good fro times. Mala noche a little bit, just said a lot is smart as shit man. He is, he's a and all aspects of life, you know, he's doing well for himself and uh, he does the right things. So Paulie's is a great person. I like him. He's a good buddy of mine. And uh, yeah, it is. You know, I think when the fans like to watch and see, you [inaudible] want to hear from the historian or to guide as the other commentator who just knows the sport and who can speak well.

Speaker 5:          01:47:42       They lay care in north side of it. Yes. But I think at some certain times during a fight they like to hear from the fight or like, Hey, what the hell is going through that guy's mind? He just got smashed, you know, with that right hand. Or you get hit with a good body shot and why does this keep happening again? Why is, why is he doing this? What's going on with the flutter? Thinks should be set in a corner. You know, they're in between rounds. So I think it's important to have a guy that's been there, done it as a commentator. Andre Ward is another interesting guy because he's also young and also world champion undefeated and just decided, you know what, I'm good. See Ya. He is, he is a right now. It actually is funny and I'm going to have to talk about it a little bit.

Speaker 5:          01:48:21       We were at, I was covering a fight, the Loma Chanko per draws a fight. And he comes up to me and I don't know where, and he's like, hey, you're like, damn, you getting big. And he's smiling. He shakes my hand and he walks down to, you know, covered a fight. And I'm sitting there and look at watching the fights and then I'm getting ready to head out after, you know, the fights about over. And he comes walking up and he goes, hey, if the offered you $10 million, would you make a come back? I'm like, fuck you. I couldn't find a reason why I wasn't. Um, I don't know. And he won't. He smiled and he walked away and I was going, I'm scratching my head, I'm going, I wonder why. You know why he would ask me a question like that. Yeah. I seen recently that he's looking at as certain fighters as a possible comeback.

Speaker 5:          01:49:05       Oh, so he's thinking about doing it again? Yeah. Yeah, it is. It's so real. It's so itchy. I just don't think you're ever going to find anything that's going to recreate the highs of like when you knocked out Tremaine tailor. How the fuck could you recreate that high? You can't. You can't. That combination when you pin them in the corner and put them away and then you walk away and you realize that you one holy shit and that don't even kick it ness all going a hundred miles an hour, you're up on that. I see the pictures all the time, all that up with the hands in the air and I see all the people and you know that that's just, it was so fast, you know? It took me wow. Before I could, I even know I walked back out of my house and I had him up.

Speaker 5:          01:49:51       You know on the side, this was before I still live with my parents at the time. And I did too. I had a pulpit at the house and I'd be leaving to go to the gym or something and I look over at the boats and um, I go, wow, you know what? Those are mine. But it never really kicked in until like a little while later. Like, those are my fucking boats. You don't like add that I did that. That I'm, I'm the role champion. Not only I've got one, but I got three of them. When you're lying in bed that night, you probably had to be going, well, what am I in a fucking dream? That's what it felt like. It is. What fight this was. God Damn, this was a fight. This was one of my all time favorite middleweight championship fights for sure.

Speaker 5:          01:50:30       And Jermaine Taylor, man, he was a bad motherfucker. He wasn't. And again, you know, a lot of people talked about the handful of flights before that and a tough, you know, with smaller guys, but he was a bronze medalist who beat, you know, demand Bernard Hopkins. There. It is doom the combination when you put them away too. Fucking phenomenal man. Phenomenal. This right here when you want it was all bore. I just put my hands up. Yup. Fuck man. I mean what that feeling like? Try to describe that. Like what is going through your head? Everything possible for him not to get back up. And I know it sounds funny when people say that, but that's the truth. You know, my big thing was if I got somebody hurt, get them out because boxing is dangerous. Right. You know, and anything can happen and they could get back up.

Speaker 5:          01:51:17       They have a chance that knocking you out or beaten you. So, but when it was over, like what does that feel like? It's, it's hard to explain it. It really is. You're just, you're, you're on cloud nine, you just not naked bring you down. You know, you're, you're, uh, you went from being a proud open means is through the roof to be in a world champion. To be in a huge superstar unboxing. Yeah. And it's hard to grasp at once and it takes time. And unfortunately sometimes you get it when it's too late. You know what I mean? You really grasp it and it's just one of them things. It's, you know, even, I was talking with a guy last night and he brought up, he was originally from South Korea and he was talking about, he goes there all the time, big business guy and he says, uh, they actually just studied my fight down or something on how you can get knocked down.

Speaker 5:          01:52:09       This is more of, you know, in your field of up your alley, how you get knocked down to what gets a guy to get back up. Every cover to recovery, the endurance to pretty much have your brain's rattled, but be able to come back that strong Brown's later and knock somebody out, you know? And for me to support answer is, you know, of course training hard, you know, making sure I'm in shape, but I guess what he's trying to figure out, I was like, what's, what's the, the brainwave pattern wise said, what's the drive that gets you to do that? What is the endurance of the muscles? And you know, that's pretty deep thinking and a little pass. I think there's a lot there. There's a lot, and there's no one. First of all, every combination that you get hit with is different. You know, some, some combinations you're just not going to get up from.

Speaker 5:          01:52:56       And some of them you, you were on the border. Can you get up? Can you not get up? How bad do you want it? Maybe think about your daughter. Maybe you think about your mom and you just kept this burst of adrenaline and you're like, fuck this. I'm getting up. And the referee gives you the count. He just fight smart. Keep your hands up and keep moving. The next thing you know that cardio kicks in and then you're back at Tyson fury. That's the way I looked at it. That's like the simple way of looking at it. Tyson fury against wilder. By all rights, that fight should have been done. He lands that right hand and then that left hook and you see Tyson fewer go down. Like he got hit in the head with an asteroid. Boom. He's just flat on his back. Like Holy Shit.

Speaker 5:          01:53:34       He knocked him out in the 12th round and then everybody thought he did the undertaker. He sat up. Yes. You know what? I like memes and gifs of him sitting up and like they showed the undertaker doing it with that right there. I think a little different from mine. I personally believe that he wasn't hurt that bad. Really. I believe that he got dropped it. That was legit, but he was laying there taking the eight, nine seconds, you know, to recover and he got up. I don't think he was out because there's no real way to be out that cold. I don't to get up, get up and the hand of Jesus, Jesus came down upon him. Man, this watch that knocked down. Pull up that knockdown. Yup. Um, I feel like that was one of the most fucking bizarre is my common. We're talking about that as far as like what's going through your head?

Speaker 5:          01:54:24       It's crazy because when I got knocked down, it was more of an equilibrium shot. But I could hear my legs were gone, but I can hear a certain people in the stands and I knew what was going on. And the first thing that was in my head was when you worked way too hard to go out like this. So it is that drive. Yeah, here it is right here. What's crazy is that wilder, look at this. Boom. I mean, come on man. This dude, he's fun. Fucking hurt. He's fucking hurt. Something happened. Jesus came down upon him. That's why it's, that's why I was saying I think, I don't know. Maybe he was hurt. I mean, he went down, he went down pretty bad. He wouldn't talk quick. Incredible. And then his ability to recover and the fact that he's not the best in shape guy either.

Speaker 5:          01:55:08       You don't think so? Well, I mean we kept moving for 12 fucking rallies. Yeah, he did do that. But to be able to get up that quick, well, how was he not the best in shape guy? I mean to be six foot. That's a funky, crazy knocked out and then while that does the sleazy gray shape for for a heavyweight, you can put it that way. I see what you're saying. Yeah. Well no heavyweight is ever going to be in the same kind of shape that say, Oh yeah your weight's going to be in just because you're carrying around so much body weight. But I was saying from the point of getting up that quick after being dropped and not to be stumbling and falling over. It's true. I mean he just came back and that's why I'm thinking more so like yeah he got hurt and I'm probably wrong on this, but I'm saying like yeah he got hurt and he's laying there and he's going to shit, let me just, let's watch it.

Speaker 5:          01:55:53       Here it comes. That fucking missile and then this one, I mean come on son timber. That's, that is some crazy shit. They said he hit his head but he did not. I let them, people say he hit his head, bounced off the Mat, it never bounced off the mat. He, he kept his head up as he was going back, which lets you know that he was conscious but doom and Bob boom. I mean he got fucking rocked, but I wish they would've had an overview because you could tell by the eyes also. Right, right. Whether or not the rolled back in his head to the side cardio is significant. If you're in great cardio shape, you recover quicker. You know there's, there's a bunch of different factors in why you recover quicker. Your mindset has to play a factor. Right. How bad you want it.

Speaker 5:          01:56:43       That's what I'm saying. I mean, no doubt he was hurt from that bunch and he went down. I was just thinking for that period of time was he laying her also saying I'm going to take the full eight and nine to get up or like you said, did a, did a hand come down upon him and rose from the dead. Yup. He's just a tough motherfucker man. And a good guy too. Super fucking smart guy. Funny. Yeah. I mean, what a character. And now when you were training and you were doing yours, your strength and conditioning, did you, will you like an old school method guy or did you use heart rate monitors and all the new school methods? No, I was, I, I liked the, uh, functional shrank training. I did a lot of that. What kind of stuff? I do a sledge hammer and tire pushing.

Speaker 5:          01:57:27       Matt Brown, uh, has a, a great, uh, he's got a, what is Matt's company? Give us his company a plug. I think it's a immortal something strength and conditioning, but he's got a great bunch of, uh, um, he's got sledge hammers but with a rounded head so you don't have to fucking swinging around and uh, and mortal combat equipment, mortal combat equipment. He's got a great sled to the stack weights on and uh, he left a lot of that stuff out there. These grip. Yeah, the war wagon. A lot of uh, different, uh, grip strength, the apparatus, things like balls at you, uh, do chin ups for those, those balls on the far left. You do a chin up script. And those things. Yeah, it's got some great shit. Those slopes depths pushing, pushing a trucks. Um, and what else did we get into it? I would go to this place called ironman warehouse and it was kind of a nice setup there too.

Speaker 5:          01:58:19       And it was more for like the, the, the gym owner. I love him to death and he is crazy. He truly is. And he's about 48 now and he could still Rondi runs with a matter of fact at the, my role title fight against Taylor at the boardwalk. Everybody kept talking about, we were like 4,000 people talking about this crazy guy running on a beach. But I think the log was like 120 pounds just running. You don't want to stop. Yeah. Real Christian Guy, you know, intuit and he does all that. He runs all the piece races with that. Um, phenomenal shape. It, well you had a place down in [inaudible] was the functional strength training. You know, I do pull ups on fire hoses and put a gripping and everything else. That's why I like Joe. And that was, you know, cause I wasn't building muscle.

Speaker 5:          01:59:01       Um, but I was getting strong as hell and I was getting also a lot of cardio work involved in that. But for the most part it was the, uh, the, the sres. Yeah, the Roman road. A log on here is this motherfucker running around with a log that can be good for your names. I wonder how he's walking right now. Like right now, I see guys do screw, screw, screw, shit like that. I go, okay, you can do that right now, but let me see what you look like in six months. Let me call you back. I'm gonna call you doing it for a long time. I don't know how he does it. That's so much weight on your joints to be running with 120 pound log on your shoulders is a freaking nature. What does that show? The Ninja Warrior or whatever. I truly believed that he could go into that and do very well on that.

Speaker 5:          01:59:48       I mean, he had to, at the ironman warehouse, they had the little balls and he swings from each one up there. Uh, he takes the 45 pound plates, he throws them up in the air and it catches them back coming down. Just crazy things like that. And that's where I went to train after the Miranda fight. I was doing all that shit on my own for the Miranda fight. And then after the Miranda, he had told me, he goes, Kelly, I got this place down here. Come down and try it out. And I was doing all that crazy stuff, man. And it worked it again. That was strong. The only thing that I wish I could have went back with that, and now as time goes on and I'm training some athletes at my gym, is we have this machine called a Virta backs PC equipment.

Speaker 5:          02:00:27       And it's amazing. I mean, it truly is. You could emulate, um, more so than you can with the bands. What you're doing. If you're a football player, you know, you want to come off Verdun Max Max is, it's an amazing clinic for a rest. Right? There is for wrestlers, is it, are these bands like elastic button but as okay as no straps. Okay. With the rubber band you, your attention is usually gone at the beginning and then get to get to a certain point to get it as where this has resistance all the way through. Oh, police system. It is a pulley system and you can set the tension on it on the back part. You could pull out and make it a little harder. The tension, but it's unbelievable. So when you go back down there's tension all the way through from beginning to end fast twitch muscle and um, a lot of wrestlers are using it.

Speaker 5:          02:01:18       Ooh, I like that. So I wish they had that because a lot adding that in with the functional strength training could have definitely made a me a lot better. And I think it could for a lot of athletes. That seems like you could do everything with that thing. Yup. That's amazing. They had the wrap there also, which is very good. It's the same concept as that, but you put it up on a fence and you could run out farther, do different things on the raptor. Also would that thing, could you do like shoulder exercises and stuff like that as well? You just have to prop it up. I've been screwing around with it at my gym and I found ways to do flies on putting a little, um, balance boards. I put that down on it and I can get the straps where you could do flies.

Speaker 5:          02:01:58       What a shoulder exercise at core. You know, especially with the raptor, you could walk out with that. And what is the raptor? It goes on the wall. You can, it's more for like travel, see if you find that thing. So you could put it on the fence at a baseball field and just swing. You could even do a Gulf street is right there. Yeah. Verdun Max Raptor. Uh, wow. Look at called the golf swing. And can you adjust the tension? Yes. Is this on the back? So you'll pull it, they have little black spots that uh, tell you, you know, it goes up to three, three spots. So that seems like that'd be great for punching power as well. It is. And the thing is, you don't want too much tension with that. I tried to explain, I got some people that work with the guys at my gym on it and they trained them more like an endurance thing.

Speaker 5:          02:02:40       And I tell him, you're defeating the purpose, you know, there, there's a place in time for strength and endurance socially, a boxer, a guys running in the morning, he's sitting pads at the gym. You had, I really think that should be focused on the explosion. Don't go to your chair. You're tired. I want every rep, every movement to have explosion. Roy Jones Jr. Yeah, yeah. That's amazing. So you just, uh, it's just enough resistance so that everything that you do just get too much resistance and you're not going to be able to really fire off the fast twitch. Right. Right. Now, the only thing I see also that could hurt people is that they do a whole workout with that Dow. What happens? You eventually get tired and fatigued and then all your motion is slow. So now you fall into a habit of that. You know, I like to work, I'm on it for about 15, 20 minutes.

Speaker 5:          02:03:26       Um, take them off and then have them do the same exercises with it after what? No, no resistance. And then it just keep it that day just with the fast twitch muscle, the small muscle training. And then the next day we go into strength or endurance. So are you training guys? I'm right now passing on this. Jim and I have a, yeah. And I have one box and the name of your gym. My Gym and was called Mine and my gym. So we had, we had changed. Yeah. Because I've already had my gym. And why Jim [inaudible]. Jim, yeah, me, Jim, Jim. Come on down to the gym by the Spanish my, yeah, or at a time. Yeah, no, we got, uh, I'm doing that with them right now. It's fun working with a strength. And conditioning, you know, I am also going to be doing a boxing gym at the end of the summer, hopefully.

Speaker 5:          02:04:11       And it's going to happen. It's just a matter of time. Now, when you were training and you were fighting, um, did you have a specific schedule of when you would do strength and conditioning and how many days a week you would run? How many days a week you would do like physical exercises. Yeah. You know, and that's another thing. You all, as I've said earlier too, you always keep learning, you know, and it was never, I wasn't, it worked for me for what I did when I was fighting and that would totally have it now

Speaker 2:          02:04:37       knowing the stuff that I know and, and you know, being involved in it, researching and, um, you know, we used to run Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, three miles, and then take Thursday off on Friday and Saturday. And then we do, on top of that, I would go to your, my strength and conditioning training and now we've got the boxing gym. That's a lot. Yeah, that's a lot on the body too. And, um, you know, as we're, like when I went to California, we did Monday, Wednesday, Friday running and it was only two and a half, three miles. And then in those days in between we did a strength and conditioning training. Um, so I didn't have a preference on that. I didn't care. Um, the only thing I did say is I didn't want to run early in the morning. Why is that? Because I didn't get going. I wasn't one of those guys in the morning and it happens to people, you know, like if I wouldn't ran too early, I would end up being the film like shit the rest of the day really you got, you know, like it was just dragging ass as where when I went and ran at like nine 30 in the morning, I got my best run, I killed it and then I felt great the rest of the day.

Speaker 2:          02:05:38       What, how much sleep would you make sure you had? That was a tough one. I got about seven to eight hours. Yeah. They say you need eight and you really should try to get 10 when you're a professional athlete. I took my Sundays off and, and I rested all day Sunday and that kind of aid, you know, a good amount of carbs and kind of what I wanted to on, on Sundays, you know, depending on where to wait was out, how far out we were from to fight. But um, I don't, I really don't believe in the theory of you got to wake your guy up at four in the morning and make them run. I don't if I was training guys, I want my guy to run out whatever I'm going to get the best run out of. That's what time I want him to run.

Speaker 2:          02:06:16       He'll adapt and especially after he keeps fighting and he'll adapt this more mind over body. Um, but I think the gym is not negotiable. Three o'clock I like to train and if I was trading guys, my Gemara, it would be between three and seven. Why do you like late afternoons? Because it gets you closer to the fight night, especially closer to a fight. I would like to actually from my guys and train about eight o'clock at night, nine o'clock depending on what they have and are going on in a personal life. So you have like a clock so your body has like a time that it knows it's going to work and I didn't do that. What did you do? I sparred, you know for three but if I'm talking about me being a trainer I would like that for my fighters. So what you've learned from your career, you just apply it?

Speaker 2:          02:07:01       Yeah. The only thing I would really take from it would be the running in the morning. You know, if my guy want to said hey coach, I'd rather run after the gym tonight and I knew that that was going to make a difference in a minute on his mouth. Okay. Run at night cause I want them to get the best run. Pause. That's the most important. So did you run for speed? Did you do sprints? Did you do long distance running? Like what did, what kind of running did you do? I did do sprints. We added, I wish we could've done more, but you know, I was big with the uh, steps to and we have ours. Yeah. Youngstown State University and Youngstown and it got one side that's pretty big as steep,

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       you know, and it goes up and I would do that probably about three times at Camp for unbeliever believer, you've got to watch how many times you do that throughout a camp because it builds muscle, especially running that high, you know, down the steps. And then when you start cutting to wait and you got to get down, this is going to be hard to lose that extra pound, which could make a big difference. Come fight night. So for a six, eight week camp, you would only run it three times, three times interested. Then I had sprints on the hills and I did regular sprints because regular sprints is firing that fast twitch muscle and is also hitting a big muscle in his building. The legs and, and strength. Um, distance was, was important, but still another big one to me is the pad work. You know, the training at the gym.

Speaker 1:          02:08:14       I'm not a big fan of bag work. Anybody hitting the punching bag? How come? Because you learn how to manipulate the bag of trick your, your trainer and everybody else. I can go ahead and bag right now. I probably do 10 rounds on it, you know, just because I know how hard to punch. It's hard to tell us to worry when you're hitting pads. I know how hard my guys punching and I'm giving him the combos in a numbers so he has to concentrate on what you want them to do and he's not throwing the punches that he wants. You know what I mean? So it's easier. I mean it's harder than it in the bag. Um, I think that's a big part of the training. You know, that I would do it, the guys and, and it's, it makes a big difference overall. Um, did you do like a lot of drills in term in terms of like a movement trills movement, drills with combinations?

Speaker 1:          02:09:03       Like how to not, not, not at home either. You know, I didn't when I trained in a young stone. No, no. I learned a lot of that. You know, when I went to California from Garcia. Yeah. So that was that one of the reasons why you were saying like, man, it was amazing that I can learn. Cause you know, I was cocky and I'm going to fuck, they going to show me after 12 years of being pros and awesome trainer. Yeah. You know, I was cocky. What? I'm like, I got all of these fights and I was, you know, great amateur, what more can you show me? And I went out there and I learned, you know, you can't be taught and uh, taking nothing away from, you know, Jack and my trainer at home. I mean that guy, he got me ready though. Like if you're fighting, I was in shape, you know, it was like a drill sergeant on that.

Speaker 1:          02:09:47       And you'll have another little thing on that which of running, you know, submit. I think now I would have my guys run on grass track was boring. I don't care if you're bored running, you know, you're going to run around a track. It's easier on the joints and a lusty man on the body. But, uh, so overall, I mean there's a lot. That's why I like it. That's why I like being involved right now with the strength and conditioning gym because I'm working with people, getting them healthy, helping them out, and eventually I could add a lot of this to my fighters, you know? Yeah. There's a long education when it comes to physical fitness, the long education, understanding how much is too much, when's the right time to do things. And that's one of the reasons why I was asking you, like how did you decide if you're going to do three times over the course of a, um, a training camp, you're going to run those stairs.

Speaker 1:          02:10:33       How did you decide that? Was that a strength conditioning coach at the side of that? No, that was just because, yes, cause I didn't want it. The muscle, I knew where he come and wait on you. Yeah. Yeah. A couple times when when you're starting to dry out, you're going to wish that you kind of didn't. But I always was afraid of the back that, you know, of the second guessing my, my conditioning. So I always wanted to be strong, you know, and again that the stuff like that Verda Max that wasn't out yet. You know, we had the bands and we do some of the exercises on that. I had never researched much at that time either. I was in great shape and I was strong as a mule, but there was other things like being athletic, I started eventually towards the end doing some cross training.

Speaker 1:          02:11:10       You said you're a big fan of that. Yeah, I absolutely am. Also, I think becoming a great athlete overall. There's nothing wrong with that and it's fun. It breaks up the monotony of the same training regimen all the time. Do you remember when they didn't want you to lift weights? They didn't want boxers to lift weights before Mackey, she'll stone, uh, before he worked with um, uh, Michael Spinks when he, when he moved up to heavyweight and fought Larry Holmes. I mean, remember people were saying like, they don't want boxers to lift weights, that it's going to tighten you up and slow you down. Like that was, that was the thought process behind it. And then from him and then in particular Holyfield and Holyfield went from cruiserweight to heavyweight and he put on a lot of mass. That was Mackey shields stone too, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean that, that just changed the game.

Speaker 1:          02:11:59       Jamie. That's your guy. But I don't want to make them have to keep searching thing. He loves it. They actually asked if you could put in, um, yeah. Kelly pelvic workout workouts. A training. We had a guy to, what's the wait, I did do weight lifting when you were, when I was fighting. Yeah. But I, and I do agree. What's the weight lifting and I don't agree with it. I don't think you should go heavy with the weight lifting if you're going to get your strength. I absolutely. Um, look how thin you are, man. Broad training. Slim bastard. Yeah. Trey put a training with rock at Rocky's or something like that. That was California. Yeah. There you go. That second one.

Speaker 7:          02:12:34       MMM.

Speaker 1:          02:12:35       Yeah, I see the lightweight. Yeah. Well we would do hundreds and hundreds of reps. Just endurance stuff. Burn, just burning. When you look at yourself without all the tattoos to go, Huh, look at all that blank canvas. Look at those arms. Yup. But you look at those arms now you're probably embarrassed it was gigantic. Tree trunks are packing now. No. Yeah, but those things kick ass those things. Fuck your head up. Yeah, exactly. I don't know if I had the snap on it now like I had done, but um, so, so the, the way stuff like that I totally agree with because it is great for muscle endurance if you're going to get your strength. I go back to the functional training for that. I don't think a boxer or a con bag, it might be a little different with Yossi Guy MMA fighters because of the wrestling and wrestling and everything else. And that will come down to having a, somebody that really knows, like I said it, he never stopped learning and it, um, but for me, what my guys yet endurance training like that. That's great. And you could even switch that in. What's some endurance

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       training to, you know, one thing we used to do at ironman standard, get a heavy chain and is locked out for the front delts and turn it, turn it, you know, 40 insurance do for a period of time. So there's just a lot of things that you could add in. I think, you know, everybody goes, well, you don't overtrain them. And that's another thing like the body, it's really hard to overtrain. I mean, you could, the only way you could really overtrain as if you're not getting the right nutrition and you're not getting the right rest, you know? Um, or if you push too hard, you don't give yourself enough recovery time and you push it too close to a fight. Yeah. See that's too long and you don't get enough rest period in between. That's a big one. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:14:09       The two long and camp, um, you know, Tim Silvia or not Tim Silvia, Tim Kennedy, who's a big, uh, who's for one time at one point, he retired now, but he was one of the top, middle way contenders. He went through two camps in a row because one of his fights got canceled, rolled right into a tech camp and then fought and then had no endurance and his fight, you could kind of tell that he was drained. They just, it was just too long. It was like seven, six or seven months of really being in camp. Something along those lines.

Speaker 2:          02:14:35       Probably in the, in the lines of some word, the nutritionist, it could come down on a, on a person like that. Is he getting enough, you know, the sources. It's also cutting a lot of weight. Exactly. So, you know, dehydration, everything else. Yeah. Um, yeah. It's, and it's hard. I mean, you got to find if you're going to bring somebody in. I was fortunate, my dad, you know, we kinda kicked ass on that. We had a little science brought, you know, broken down to a science and uh, we, we made weight good and we were strong. Um, did you monitor your heart rate ever? No. Never. Just felt how you felt. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:15:09       You know, like, did you write down like how different kinds of exercises you were doing?

Speaker 2:          02:15:14       Did you play? You played it off and I still do that. I still put that into my, even a weightlifting. Really? Yeah. I feel like when you write down your limit yourself, how so? Because if I go in, I see guys all the time, not knocking at everybody, but I see them come in with a little notepad and they have what they got and I see him go over and do literally only four sets on a bench and then they write down what they did and then they go over and do some dumbbells or same with the squats. I feel you're limiting yourself. I mean, you didn't work that muscle to a, you know, failure then you should most of the time because if not, that becomes maintaining, you're not breaking down the muscle fibers, you know, unfortunate recoup. I feel, you know, when you go and lift, I'm not saying every Zach time you got to kill it, but when I go in, I want to do either a little bit heavier or more reps than I did last time.

Speaker 2:          02:16:04       You know what I mean? For me to get to the point where I want to get in it, it has worked for me. Um, I, I do, I feel like when you write down, the only time I do write things down is if I'm doing a chart, I'll go through that chart. And then when I finish what I finish out with so many reps in that same percentile of my PR, you know what I mean? And I'll go down now, then I have a speed day and endurance day, what's it? And when I rubbed out, and I do sometimes have to 300 reps, you know, on a body part and speed and endurance. And then before I even do that, I work on safe as bench or squat. I get the bands and I have my guys do no more to six reps and all gotta be explosion because that helps empower lift, lifting for.one rep Max.

Speaker 2:          02:16:47       You know what an explosion off so it comes down, you know, and that's my theory on it. And a lot of people, you know, do it. And then you got guys who do write down though. Do you think there's any benefit in the kind of lifting that you're doing now for a boxer? I think right now if you have the time, yeah. It could help you atomic in between if you had time to get that big or get that strong for maybe two months of heavy. But I also think that you need a good period of time of no heavy lifting to recover before we start really boxing. So your body's going to be used to it. Muscle memory, you know, you'll still be, you're not going to lose all that strength because you're, you're not just stopping to power lifting and not doing anything.

Speaker 2:          02:17:23       You know what I mean? It seems like a real guessing game. At least it experiment. I wouldn't try it if I was active and I had an active fighter. But yeah, I would like to see somebody try that eventually. One day you never know what her to go, always coming out with something or they're always debunking some other, you know, uh, you have to do this. And my favorite thing is where I get an about the training. When people say you can't do this two days a week, you can't bench or squat. Look at your guy's in jail. All they do every day. Yeah. If I lift weights and eat shitty food, they don't have the supplements that we have. You know, they can't take a protein powder drink and bcas so, and they're not small. They're huge. You're jacked, you're lifting every day, you know. So

Speaker 4:          02:18:09       I don't know. Well you familiar with Pavel Tot Salini? Yes. Wasn't he the guy also with the kettle bells or yeah. Yeah, he's um, he's got some interesting thoughts about, um, about strength training in particular because he's one of those guys that you, he believes you should do more rest in between reps, uh, less reps and you should do it more often. So instead of like one brutal workout a week, will you break your body down the walk? Like you're getting fucked in the ass by a rhino for two days. Instead of that, you, you work out with less repetitions. Don't go to failure, but do it two or three times a week. You get more repetitions overall over the end of the week, but you'll, you'll be able to recover better. And you never get that full breakdown, but your body gets just as strong or stronger.

Speaker 2:          02:18:59       I seen that and I actually, I was reading on that and that was going to put that in, you know, uh, put that into my program and I read a lot of them. I see like Semans would west side. Um, they got some great ideas and that's when it comes to lift the weights and power lift and there's only so much, so somebody got it from somebody, you know what I mean? Like west side, they were big with the Russian Olympic team and everything else. There's only so much you could do. There's only so many programs you could do where you're not tapping in and copying off this person's. Um, I think that in, there is nothing

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       wrong with that either. Now, not changing it up after awhile in shotgun up body. I think that actually helps you get stronger, you know, and changing the program a little bit. But um, you know, if that works, I don't know. And that's something that I may try one day because I'm doing power lifting, but pilots and ain't going to be my vacation home in Hawaii. You just doing the power lifting for a drink for fun. It was, you know, it was something that was fun. And uh, I got guys who I've gotten involved with a buddy of mine, actually a coach on, you know, certain days of the week. We work on a heavy Lonnie Atkins. He's great. He's a like six, seven time world champion power lifter and drug free, you know, um, federations like Ra and a WMP F and I, and asked what I'm in because I feel like, you know, I have not, I'm not knocking the other people that use the steroids and stuff, but for me, I like going the natural route and you know, especially if you think about fighting again, because if you do, you don't want to fuck up your endocrine system.

Speaker 1:          02:20:25       So that's where I really turned against it also is because of the boxing. You know what I mean? Um, I don't want to make anybody too mad, but when people would use it, I feel like you're taking away. And then I do feel like it's cheating. I tell people in the gym, my gym, you know, there are certain people in our diet that do it and I, and they try to come over and tell people how to work out and this kind of like, listen, you're working out is totally different than disguise and what you do to get big as totally different all because of that reason. Yeah, it is. It truly is. And the power lifting, he's actually, and I got guys right now that are freaks of nature that do it and you could tell that they're not on it because if they are, then he, I thought long talk with her dealer.

Speaker 1:          02:21:04       Um, you know what I mean? One of those type things. But, uh, I, I like doing only because for me it's, it's not cheating, you know? And also I liked the fact of like, when I hit a plateau, I look, it's more fun for me to go through and research things and look at like how do I get out of that and what's, what's good nutrition that helps naturally raise this or raised that, you know what I mean? And different workout routines, the board work chains, you know, add that all in. So that's where it comes fun for me also. Yeah. Do you do, um, do you get your blood work done or anything like that? I did get a blood panel last, uh, last year and was, yeah, that's it. Yeah. And it can only get like normal ones, regular ones. Kind of afraid to him, Hey, I'm going, I'm getting to that age, you know, I don't want that shit coming back bad.

Speaker 1:          02:21:50       You don't want to know. Yeah. You know? Hell, if I start filling it then I'll go. But um, no, but you should too. I recommend it to everybody and not every athlete, you know, they should and eventually my time has to go back soon also. Yeah, I think it's a really important thing. I think everybody should do it on a regular basis. I really do. I know you don't want to know about anything bad, but you do know, but you have to, if there really was something funky going on and you know, you went to the doctor and the doctor's like, Kelly, these, these numbers are bad. This is, we gotta we gotta do some more. Exactly. Work more tests and see what the fuck's happening. Especially with all these different diets that people were getting on. I'm seeing, yeah. Horrific things

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       that I had a brother in law from, you know, a certain diet that Kito Diet. You know, what happened to him? Fatty liver. A this, cause he's done it. You don't drink. Yeah. Wow. That's fucked. You know, diet, that's what I'm hearing. Well, if you really look at it, I mean, you're eating the fat, all that fat. And sometimes it's for me. Yeah. But if Jess, all your body got to burn, you know, and your organs got to the, what happens with people where it does get dangerous is first of all, if you have certain, uh, certain genes, certain people, it's just not the best diet for, and it's, it's a lot of trial and error to find out. But it's also if you engage in a high fat contact dot content diet, but you also have high carbohydrate, which is where a lot of people cheat and fuck up, that's not good.

Speaker 5:          02:23:08       That's, that's not good for you. Like you, you got to get your body into Ketosis, into ketosis. If you don't get your body into ketosis and you're taking this high level of fat and the car I love Oh carbs, it's not, it's just not a good combination. But it also has, you know, boards to do on it. If you come off of it, you can't just indulge into the carbs either, right? Don't you slowly work that back into your body. Always knows how to process carbs. It's more difficult to get your body fat adapted, but once your body does get fat adapted. But I've found is a, I'm not on a ketogenic diet right now, but when I've been on it, um, I can get back in it pretty quick, but it takes a while. Like the first time I did it, it took a solid two weeks before I felt normal.

Speaker 5:          02:23:51       For two weeks I was dragging ass. It was hard to stick through it. Like I didn't want to stick through it. I just wanted to, I'm like, I'm just going to have a fucking apple and a bowl of pasta and blow this died off. But um, if you get through it, then you feel your body switch over when you feel you bought a switch over, what happens is, um, you have more even energy throughout the day. Um, uh, less tired, no crash in the middle of the day. But I do have to say it took a long time before my workouts felt like I could have the same intensity. I would die off quicker. And as how I look at even some of those, um, what do you call it? Intermittent died things to them and fasting. Yeah. Fasting. Yeah. Like the w when you're drying out and you're not eating and that period, I wouldn't recommend working out at that time.

Speaker 5:          02:24:33       Power lifting or a strength training. Yeah. I think that's a different kind of animal. Yeah. Cause now you're getting, carrying down the muscles and everything else. Maybe some cardio wouldn't hurt. Listen, I'm not, that's why I'm saying I'm not knocking all of them. And I, and my brother in law, he, the doctor told them they think that's what it was from now granted that could be because he messed up on a diet somewhere along the line, you know, um, meeting, uh, I had a doctor that, a buddy also that got fatty liver from eating too much of the meat. Again, that could have been grass fed or steroid type meat makes a difference. That was, what the fuck. I don't even know if that does cause it does. Yeah. And me personally, I'm not knocking any of it cause her pretty soon I've got to try some shit myself, you know what I mean? Um, I got to start losing weight again. Well why did you start eating like crazy?

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       Because of the power lifting. Yeah. Those guys. Yeah, he like fucking savages and notary also coming out to like where you can eat right. Lose weight and still be strong, you know, um, me, uh, I started eating like that and then it really, I'll tell you where it gets me. So I was never a real big sweet tooth, sweet tooth theater. Ah, I is a piece of cake or a candy bar and her, I'd have like total throughout the day and one count of pop. I drank a half a can in a morning or an afternoon. Then at night for people who didn't grow up in Ohio. Oh yeah. That was soda, Coca Cola, Pepsi, you know, sorry, you'll pop Guy Columbus, Ohio in the house. Yes. And uh, that's right. Yeah, we were talking about that and that's what I would do. So it wasn't that bad, but it's still enough sugar, long fucking sugar.

Speaker 1:          02:26:14       And then I was starting the one meat, I was doing a to 20 pound weight class, I was two 32 and my guy was like, you ain't gonna make it in six days to get down to two to 20 and that kind of like, I get a chuckle at that because I had to make 160 before, so I got all this fat sitting on me. You're going to tell me I can't lose that in six days. A bet. And this is for a power lifting. Yeah. So I got down with that and that was doing a wash. What? I didn't even do hardly any cardio for that and I still got down fairly easy to, to 20 then now we're on falling into this bad habit is I'll have like a piece of cheesecake sitting in a refrigerator. Okay. I know. And I love cheesecake.

Speaker 1:          02:26:54       And that's true. That's one of my favorites. It's a good one, eh? Would it be two cans of pop left and right? And my whole thing is I can't start. I can't start watching cause I don't want to say diet. I started saying watching what I eat and I go, I can't do that too. When it's gone. I can't have that. I know. It's weird. I'm telling you I can't, I can't start until it's gone. But you can't throw it away. Can I can't throw it away, throw it away because it's the only one piece left and I don't want to do that. So, and then the next thing I know my sister in law who was a hell of a baker, she makes something for the kids or it makes me a homemade cheese cake. And the next thing I know I'm back into the same thing again.

Speaker 1:          02:27:32       Now let me tell you something else that contributes to this. I think all the years of of fighting and having to watch my weight and especially for me to get done in one 60 and even when I was fighting at 47 and the amateurs I, my life was pretty much running and it was a job, you know, it was time somebody was there. I just couldn't go run. I had to run it so fast and I was being timed for it and distance. I had to watch what I was eating. I had people over me watching what I was eating and when I retired I was like, fuck this man, I'm free. Right. You know what I mean? And I, I sometimes put that in the back of my head, I shouldn't, but I put in the back of my head like, man, you deserve this man.

Speaker 1:          02:28:10       You did that all these years like, but now it's coming to the point to like you are getting a little older, you look a little bit like shit other than your arms. Like you're going to have to start it in a treadmill. You know what I mean? It's one of those type things where if you just cut the sugar out, but yeah, and it works and I don't want to hear people say that they can't lose weight now that will only work for a certain period of time until that like levels out. Then you guys, that's when you start tweaking the calorie intake and then you can lose a lot of weight if you just cut out the sugar. Yeah, you can. Yeah. So that's why, I mean I don't want to hear people say it's hard. So I will, I'll be eventually, I, you know, I said when I get home from this trip, because like last night I went out with my buddy and we ate uh, pizzas and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          02:28:52       So you know, cause I'm Ma, I don't have the access to healthy food right now. While you're on the road places in La, you can eat healthy. I know there is, dare you, I dare you say you can't eat healthy here as the mindset men. I know. Yeah. The mindset. But that's, you know, the thing about a lot of great fighters is they're very impulsive too. Yeah. It's just that fuck it. Fuck it. Mentality that sometimes carries over to eating. Look at a lot of your ad guy. Retired fighters. Yeah. They get mean. They balloon up and blow up. You know, again, I keep saying, I'm not like bragging or anything, but here I'm, I'm fairly decent. You know what I mean? I think at least you enjoy working out. I think some guys, they got to a point where they worked out so hard for camps that when it's over they don't want to do shit.

Speaker 1:          02:29:36       Yeah. It just like I'm done. It's over. No desire, no drive. Well that's why cardio's very rare for me. Right. Yeah. And uh, you know, I used to say this to all the time after a fight, I have probably two or three weeks off and I, there was a place called Mill Creek Park and a lot of people go to run and exercise and stuff like that. And there's a main street that goes past the park and you see people riding a bike and running. And I'll never forget, my wife actually started laughing. I just got done with a fight and we're driving past Mule Creek Park and these people were out running. And I go, what idiots like who gets up and go run? And I left for, chances are I'm hilarious. Chances are I, if I didn't have to do it like that, I didn't have somebody hounding me or over me while I was running.

Speaker 1:          02:30:20       Chances are I would actually like running and I would like doing cardio and add that into my training. But because it was a job for all the mirrors from nine years old to 30 years old, it was like, screw this man. I don't want to run to run as if there was a fire or a big ass dog behind me. You know? That's the only way. Or if I want to run to the buffet table, but I know some people do it every day, every day before work and they'll put in five, six miles every day. And it, you know what, in this reality you have to, you got to any more or less you would want to be out of shape and, and miserable. I think it's great to actually start working out and even for me as I'm lifting weights and it's fun and it's considered exercising, but, um, and now with what I'm thinking of doing and everything else, I got to start getting into that. You know, I'm hitting the bag and everything's fun and I'm hitting the pads and that's cardio. I mean that shit, that shit's really cardio. And now to run a really thinking about finding and you're, you said more than 60%, right? 80% I would say around

Speaker 5:          02:31:20       70 to 80. That's a lot. That is, that is. But again, and I'll shrine going to see you this, um, there was a lot of that goes behind a lot more to think about also, you know, so I don't want, because what I don't want is in six months when I say, you know what? No, I don't want the backlash for it. He's walked up again and he knows. And that's unfortunately, that's the way it goes. It does. But you got to not read that shit. I know, but that's unfortunately, it really is. Especially comments, you know, I tried not to and you catch them and you get them. I try not to. I, it's, it seems like the boxing world in particular has a lot of fucking haters, but you know what, it's nothing like football, like of a fighter loses. I was was watching Barstool sports, barstool sports, Instagram.

Speaker 5:          02:32:08       They got some fucking guy leaving a football game screaming and yelling. I'm like, this guy is what I think about when I think of like Douche Stout, like sports fans. This guy fucking screaming about somebody not being able to make it kick. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah, go ahead and crazy. It's so funny. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love hearing when I was playing football and when I was in high school, when you're watching these big games and you'll see it on social or I'd be at a buddy's house and I see have I would've made that yet. Right. People love saying stupid shit like that. Like how many times did anybody given you boxing advice? Oh, I have people that, I don't know the difference between a left Toke and efficient book. I swear to God they don't.

Speaker 5:          02:32:50       And why didn't you just hit him? Because he should have got up and hit him in his TMZ. It material. No, but I mean like, like they're saying to you, why didn't, why didn't you just hit him? I don't know. You don't have I seen the episode that was the funniest. I think it was on one of your episodes with Charlie Murphy and they are doing the Mike Tyson and like de la Hoya situation that happened like the guys that he could beat up the lawyer and I true. I wish I could happen on a regular basis, you know like call people out on it when you're in front of somebody. Yeah. How many times I hear people say like I, I could, I couldn't beat him. And it's like, why? Why is he sitting on like $25 million? And you're over here picking up ups shipments, you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          02:33:30       Like there's a difference for a reason. Nobody's knocking what you do, but you shouldn't knock what he's doing. Well, you're delusional. You are. People are dilution. But for whatever reason, especially when it comes to sports and fighting in particular, people just say some unbelievably delusional shit. I don't know why and I truly don't and I don't understand it. And I'd never get into the argument long enough to even ask the question. Well, what was the last time you went on somebody else's page and commenting on shit, I can't tell you cause you're a world champion and I don't want to ask another reason. Hey, let's, you know what, that's funny too, because how many of might want to write how many of the threads in it and may involve me? Because you know, again, a reason why I have to stay up on it is because that's part of my podcasts. You know, we're through the social media, so I have to, and he's boxing groups or

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       even on our own fight or a punchline, a box and group. You see the comments and I'm just going and I'm like, I can't really answer that though because I look corny as shit if I answered that one. You know? And so it's hard and it's frustrating. It really is. Well, the, the interesting world that we live in today, I mean, it's a great time to communicate with people. It's amazing. No, it's also a great time for Douche bags to communicate. It is dangerous time actually. But I think it's cool that you're doing this podcast thing and, uh, I think it's awesome and I really do hope you do commentary as far as you fighting. Hey Man, if you find a watch, but if you don't fight, I'll be happy to. I'll definitely keep you in the loop. Tell me. I know. I will definitely keep you in the loop coming down.

Speaker 1:          02:35:01       If you do announce something, something's happening, I will do. Let us know and tell people how to get ahold of your podcast. How can they get my podcast is the punchline. Dot Live. That's the easiest way to get to it. Or on Youtube.
