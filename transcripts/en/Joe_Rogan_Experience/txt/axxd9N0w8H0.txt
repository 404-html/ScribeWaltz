Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Oh, good googly Mowgli. Ladies and gentlemen, this episode of the podcast, if you're looking for like a regular podcast where people are going to talk about interesting shit and bring up topics that are fascinating and intellectually stimulating, that shit ain't happening today. This episode. What are they saying? Are they saying that? No. What are they saying? The sing us. Oh Shit. We're already live. You late. Fucks sit down, up. Sexy face. Have you been back to the freezing place? And so we grabbed that backpack. You guys were broadcasting. Don't have a, just a regular conversation. This is actually a podcast. Yeah, it's videotape. Videotape to we're live. That's true. You don't want to be videotaped. We can go incognito. We can just put a logo on my face, right?

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       We're a, this is like I was saying before, you guys walked in. This episode is not a regular podcast. This is what we're calling, we're calling them the fight companion podcast. We did it, uh, during the last few of see broadcasts that a I wasn't a part of and we had a great fucking time. So we decided to do it again. Brendan Chavez here. Hollow Brian. Brian Cowan is here, edge it bra is here, the original, uh, and uh, we are watching a, yeah, yeah, sure. I'll get you some, some nerve like a box of Alpha brain right now for brain function without it. Um, we're watching the Brazil broadcast, but I have UFC fight pass so we can, uh, we can watch the Moose saucy versus Munoz fight, which has already taken place. You know what happened?

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       You're a friend, a friend, and a fan of a good dude. It's a tough one, man. Musashi live like a fucking beast. We'll, we'll come to that later. Well, he took them down. You want to watch it real quick while we're waiting for the fights over here so my neck doesn't hurt. It's not possible. No, I'll show you the, this is, this is the end. It's pretty much this. You're saying Munoz could take it right behind you. Munoz tried to take them down. Watch. He tried to take him down, got him to the ground, got inside control, went for the Guillotine, wound up being on top and uh, eventually got his back from out to them. Yeah, it was pretty slick. Mark Turns did. He's good. He's fucking really good. You know, a lot of people sleep on his ground game, man. They think about him as a kickboxer. They shouldn't, it, his ground game is very, very high level and it was a sweet transition to the way you did it. You know, Munoz is, uh, he's no joke. You know, he's a good wrestler, very strong guy and move saucy for him to do this to him. This was a NCAA champ, right? Two Times in a row, four time. All American. Listen with Munoz in practice,

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       this is the same thing he does when he gets the mount. He goes for that single leg and it causes them a lot of trouble. So he would work with here on Henner about options not to do that, but it's just in his nature when the bullets are flying to turn the wrestling, he gets him in trouble, man. Yeah. Well, that is the transition that a lot of guys make, especially when they feel like they're super dominant wrestlers and they feel like, look, I'm already where I want to be. I can just complete this single. But while he's, he was going for, uh, the takedown Musashi hit him with some nasty fucking elbows. Man. They were really ugly, really ugly elbows and uh, I think those probably took a lot out of him. Man. Those were horrible elbows. Oh, what a sweet move, man. So he couldn't, he couldn't, I was quite taken down and get on top. The out grappled flattens. What does your Sassy is, is, is that a, an Iranian name? Persian name? I think it is. Maybe Armenian. You know, I'm not sure. It sounds, uh, oh, that's me. That's Joey. Oh Shit. Let's find out. Tough man. Sucks to watch.

Speaker 3:          00:04:12       Yep.

Speaker 2:          00:04:13       You rock your live. Joey. Do you live Joey Diaz? [inaudible] phone call baby. He's Armenian. Did you watch the Munoz slide? Oh, he hung up. He probably lost him saying that is funny. You know, just asking if kiss was, that's how funny Joey, like maybe like 15 years ago, that's something you can Google or hall of fame. I don't think so.

Speaker 4:          00:05:07       Getting frozen yogurt, I'm getting pregnant with a beautiful blonde a while back and gene Simmons is sitting down as I come back in to get like Vanilla Yogurt. I said, I'm going to get one and she's outside and I go on and he looks at me and he goes, he goes and I go, hey man, how are you doing? I go, it's like your friend. Very cute. Like you're feeling friend, something like that. And I go and I go, I said, yeah, yeah, it's great man. Yeah, it's amazing. I'm just thinking about it. You guys been doing this for 20 years, you've been taught, you know, I'm famous for 20 years and he goes 30 30. I was like, right, right, right. Okay. And that was the end of that. It's high by the way, doing stand up for him. That was it. Well, doing Santa for him at the, uh, MMA awards, like he's in the front row. I think he, I, he didn't quite laugh, but he did open his mouth a couple of times and kind of looked at me.

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       Yeah. He kind of went out to one of the most nervous I've ever been. He came to see me on New Year's Eve. He brought his family. That's nerve wracking. Simmons, his brother and his or his son rather. Uh, who's funded six, eight giant kids. All families. John, I was like, their child a basketball is like, they want you in a content is tall. Yeah. Yeah. They're big humans. But it was the weirdest thing ever. It's like gene Simmons is in the crowd. Like Gene Simmons kind of like, Oh fuck yeah it does. I tearing it up. I brought, I brought it up and call them out. I had to happen, had to for me, I was like, I just got to tell you I'm nervous. Well that's like I couldn't stand up. I did stand up for, for Harvey Cartel and Harry Dean Stanton and there in the audience to see me. Oh my God. I was, I was nervous man. I found myself very nerve Bieber in the crowd. Yeah. I wasn't nervous about,

Speaker 5:          00:06:45       oh, I saw you. You were shitting your pants on Biba. Yeah. Right. You sent me a text. I got beavers hair. Right. What does Bieber, who's got the tattoo with Floyd? He's hanging out with Floyd. That's the problem. Come on. Does he have to do just be cool and fucking sing? Don't act all tough. Tough. Would it be,

Speaker 2:          00:07:12       I agree with all of you. I don't think he's doing anything wrong. I think if I was 19 I would be one

Speaker 5:          00:07:17       way more out of control. If I had a half the kids, the kids doing fan fucking tasks, so he ne he egged the neighbor's house, whatever. He's in a fight with an asshole who lives next door to him. I probably have indentured servants I'd be out of out of you will think, why not people killed his next door. Neighbors would be like 10 miles away, dude. No, no, no, no. That's it. Living next to books is a very

Speaker 2:          00:07:44       crowded community. I mean, Joe and I am, I'm going to join. I wanted to get a pit bull Joe and I like idiots found, I find this advertisement. It says pitbulls bread right out of the box. I was like the Joe. He goes, what? I go, I found fighting dogs. I want Charles on the end of a leash was like, I'll come with you. We'd go find that sketchy dude. Catch the sketchy criminal, like, oh yeah. I don't know if he's selling it, but he's definitely, he gave his dog. He was giving these talk is protein powder. I was like, all right, well I want one of those. Yeah, it was great. Yeah, kind of until it killed a baby cow and two goats and a and another dog and then they had to put it down. Dogs are not good pets. They're sweet as hell. And then I just gave bread gain. Brendan, the ones that are, look, it's on the genetics man. 100% of the genetics. I would have had a pitch, so if I was Justin Bieber at that age, I would have sort of Justin Bieber. I'd have lions. Yeah. Fuck yeah. We can think about what Tyson had. If you, uh, it depends entirely on the dog, but even if you soup, like if you're really good at like taking your dog

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       to dog parks and getting them used to being around people, they still have mad animal aggression, aggression trigger. You never know what them, what dom Irrera when Justin Bieber was in the audience, dumb Americans. I mean, cause you know Justin and must've been really hard for you. The struggle between the age of 13 and 14 when you were a man. By the way. I still worse Damo railroad impression that Justin beaver movie never surrender. Never give up. I believe when you're fly I the one to see it. I said, let's go watch that in goof on it and we'll record. We'll just goof on this stupid ass movie like Justin Bieber movie. I couldn't wait to watch it and goof on it. But when you go and you watch it, you man, when you, when you know the story of how he blew up, it's when you actually know how to youtube.

Speaker 4:          00:09:45       It's pretty crazy. I thought he was a, uh, a producer project or like some labels putting together. They did not want. They didn't, nobody wanted to sign him. He blew up on his own from Youtube. How just cause he was so good. He's, he's in a fucking amazing singer. He can sing his ass. He plays drums. He plays guitar in that. Let's let everyone knows. Her fight is about to start. If you're watching this, the, here's the problem. If you watch this online, it's a 15 second delay between us. This is what I had to get out between when we're talking to the fights. The fights are at Verde happened by the time you're hearing this. So pause like 15 seconds and then catch up. Right now it's four 51 of the first round. You should apply. Let honey Jason and Robbie Pearl. I'm not, I'm not mad at those.

Speaker 4:          00:10:33       Ring card girl is the new Brazilian rent cars. Got Pow POW. Did you get to thing on a shoulders? Might be a little much. She just couldn't get out of that on a tee shirt instead. But honey, Jason's a bad motherfucker and he's, yeah, he's a wild man. He got in Brazil. All right. Jeremy Stevens knocked him out with a head kick, but he uh, he came back with a wind. His next fight after that, Jeremy Stevens hit them with the kick from hell. I wonder how we got that name homies and well, oh, Jason's his nickname. That's why he wears the hockey mask. I wonder how we got that one. Has anybody ever asked him the ultimate fighter tattoo? Yeah, he won. He won the first season of the Brazilian show. That that right. If that's a left or a right, right. Looks like if he, if he throws it and commenced, it's going to connect. What are you talking about son? Please? Can we mute him when he goes, hey man, it was all of the UFC fighter. Please talk to Brian. Brian. Never say things like that. And guys, if you're going to comment on the fight, you got to do it in a Brazilian accent.

Speaker 4:          00:11:36       Okay. You fee if you connect with the ride like that, there's going to be a pro Arnold [inaudible] shitting on his dominant rare impression. Oh, they're on the Brown. Oh, transition trying for an arm bar. Got a little, hi

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       honey. Jason falls off the top. He's nice and loose. He's keeping loose. Robbie Peralta, he's a tough motherfucker. This is going to be a good fight. This is an interesting fight.

Speaker 5:          00:12:03       He kinda looks like if Dan Hardee and Jens Pulver had a kid. Yeah. Or actually I think, I think it's Tom Hardy. Chuck laid out. Yeah. Both of those work. Yeah, it looks there's a lot of Dan Hartigan there. Yeah, there is

Speaker 2:          00:12:19       Dan Harlow with Jens Pulver. He's good looking kid hardy. Some chick hardy got pregnant.

Speaker 5:          00:12:26       Oh.

Speaker 2:          00:12:28       Oh Damn. I sneak. That was sweet. What were you saying about pregnant chicks though, before that elbow happened? No, I was just getting into the story of this background. Oh, how he became looked like that. I'll make a call right now. If he catch, he's going to catch them with that. Right. That's spinning elbow was fucking magnificent. Tastic gonna catch him with the rice. You know, you didn't see it common either. He didn't, it didn't telegraph it. He threw it. It was beautiful and it was also, it was unexpected. Did you guys see some of the prelims? Yeah. Did you see? Watch the hydro damn fight. Yeah. What did you say? Did you see a god? Who was it homeboy? Um, they're just throwing caution to the wind. Stopped the fight and the second round? No. Which fight was it onto? The first ones? Nope. Was the first one on Fox. Oh Man, I missed him.

Speaker 2:          00:13:22       But a standing ovation would probably be able to get that standing ovation from Joe Silva. Wow. Which is hard to do. It's not for what? Five Joe Joe Silver first fight on Fox sports one. He's a real kind of sore that Joe Silva, that mother fucker know, seen a couple of fights in his day. He knows about every fighter on the planet at all times. That sounds ridiculous. But he basically does anytime a guy, he's like making it into the big leagues. Silva knows about it. He's like a super fan and I love talking to him about fights. He trains too and he's always trained. Yeah. But I love talking to him about fights. Me and him have some really interesting conversation about fights. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:14:00       Oh, he put them in that arm bar? No, he put me in an arm, but I know he did it. No, he didn't sit around. They were just, no, no, not for real. For Real. No. You wanted to try out Joe Joe's way bigger than that.

Speaker 2:          00:14:18       Show me some new variation. Armbar and it wasn't effective.

Speaker 5:          00:14:22       You didn't repeat real meat head stuff. I was, you know, was he was, he had a good idea.

Speaker 2:          00:14:29       Dia. It's just he didn't take into account a couple things and one of them was that he wasn't controlling my body. I was like, I'm not you. You don't know.

Speaker 5:          00:14:38       And it was a, it was a decent idea of 50 pounds of muscle on him that helped. So no matter what, if he would've put on a traditional Brazilian Carlos Gracie senior Armando still to slip

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       you gotta you gotta mid sized dog on him, you could just add, that's how much more weight you have on it. We were, uh, we were talking about, um, Steve Maxwell was in here and he was talking about how he had this dude who was this gigantic football player. It's just total super athlete, 280 fucking pounds, pure muscle NFL player college where we're talking to college. No, no, no, it was, I forget, I forget. I think either way. I think it was a a, I think it was a NFL player, but anyway, giant dude. Right. And the a was rowing with one of his brown belts and the guy gets him in a mounted arm bar mount some takes his arm fully locked in arm bar and they'd do it. Stands up with them like a Turkish getup. All my God, all my arm over there and they were like, don't slam.

Speaker 2:          00:15:33       I'm dot. Oh my God. I'm going to let him go. Let him go. Put him down, put him down. Everybody backs. Let them know it was just, there was, it was so much stronger than it did. Like the other dude was only, or like a buck 60 he was so much stronger than it was. Just insanity. I just had some about Andre Carter who played defensive end for the 40 niners and for the past, and I just met him. He's six seven two 65 and just the most ridiculous athlete. And I always do this. How'd you think you're doing the UFC? Huh? Big Guy. Huh? Duwan EFC or fuck no man, he get tore up. He get wrong. Yeah, the enlist and people are always like, oh how it NFL elite athletes, Lebron James. It takes a special kind of athlete to get punched in the face the first day in the gym.

Speaker 2:          00:16:16       Like you know what? I want to do more of this. I'm gonna come back, look at that elbow. Look at this album. Oh and there's not a million dollar signing bonus jam. I was hoping they were going to show that again. That elbow was goddamn beautiful. Yeah. No million dollar signing bonus. Super Dangerous. A long way. Very nothing guaranteed. High risk. Very low potential reward. What it is is football players and any professional athlete really they will, if they got into Jujitsu or if they got into MMA, they will progress a lot quicker than your average guy. Cause they have the athleticism balance. So that's what it was like. Will it, does he have the whole package? The mental package, the work ethic and the technique, the heart shit. And because of the fact that it's not a guarantee, you got to be looking for glory.

Speaker 2:          00:17:01       You really have to be doing it for glory. You can't really be mine it for money. You gotta be doing it to get really fucking good at and be Gloria. Listen, there's a lot of guys who in the NFL who I played with are in college and there's some guys in fine too, but mainly in these other sports where they would walk away from if they could. They hate doing it. They hate playing football. It's just the money. So damn good. Rolled with some elite football players. Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean some big powerful guys used to have at the gym. Who is that dude who was, I don't know what level football he played, but uh, I used to always call rolling with him. It was like riding liberal, driving the ball, rolling with them. You know what I'm talking about? How many Alpha brain should I take?

Speaker 2:          00:17:42       Four. I take nine. Yeah, give me and I take four floors. Do you remember the Guy I'm talking about? I want to take the football player, Eddie. Uh, football, big black guy. Super strong. Really flexible. No, wasn't handy. Old Legends did. Yeah. All logins old. The BRAYA legends? Yes. Football player. Oh, Leanne Macklin. I think that's him. Yeah. He played running back in college. Oh my God. This guy was an athlete. Ridiculous. He's learning Jujitsu, but athlete. But it was like riding the bull. He was just so fucking strong. I'll tell you what I mean. Shane. Shane Carwyn was 300 pounds when I first started with him and he would, you know, Shane would, he'd go do his job. He'd be gone having Andrew, he'd be gone for six weeks and I'd be working on Jujitsu three times a day, seven days a week. I'm like, I can't wait for Shane to get back. I'm a role, this big Mug, that thing that he's just so bad. Nothing like you said, you'd strap something on him. He just fricking, her Kelly is out of honey. Jason just mounted Robbie Peralta and Robbie Paul to explode in his car. He's talking real quick. It was a good move. Both of these guys are tough. Hey Man,

Speaker 5:          00:18:51       every guy, see tonight's going to be pretty sweaty if some of his, uh, is a sweat a lot. They got a lot of muscle mass. This guy has a little car to say. These guys have a lot of muscle on them.

Speaker 2:          00:19:07       This guy's a stud. They like fighting these guys. These guys fight.

Speaker 5:          00:19:11       These guys are fighting. Ooh.

Speaker 2:          00:19:16       Oh. Tries to a Omoplata lost it. Lost Control. Try it needs to learn some rubber guard like that shit until it doesn't work on these guys guys. A lot of stuff doesn't work. These guys exercise. I saw natural shit's totally natural. Can I be honest? Fighting hurts. It hurts for anybody out there. Robbie Peralta on top kicking haunted Jason in the legs. It's got to hurt. Interesting way. She fibers it. Never know like how long to to stand there and when to step them back up. Obviously homeboy, he doesn't want to go to the ground with them. So you might say, I think you should probably stand up possible. Right? But it's a tricky situation. It's like, remember you used to watch those old Jack Dempsey films and that he would knock a dude down then hover over. Cause when the guy tried to get back up, you'd punch up and people would be like, oh that's so cheap.

Speaker 2:          00:20:09       That's so cheap. You know, they used to be able to do that. That's some cheap shit. Now you have to, you know, stand in neutral corner and the boxer has to wait for the guy to get up. But it's kind of unrealistic. So when you see a scenario like this, I think it's kind of interesting. Peralta was, you know, holding his legs and kicking them and they're beautiful right hand. That was nice. That didn't hurt. You see how he said come in and he got hit the minute he got hit, he started doing that. The a hydro ego damned fight earlier. Um, he was fighting, what's his name? Never met her. Never good. Madoff. I believe it is. You're asking me to remember it when you see Paulo Thiago so many lost another one. He Paul. Tiago does. Yeah. Damn. Who did he lose to today? Some Russian cat.

Speaker 2:          00:20:52       Did. I don't, I think he's lost. He's lost. That was going on with Thiago Silva. Like that whole situation. Oh, Thiago Silva. Yeah. Yeah. Um, apparently, uh, you know, he got arrested and they kicked him out of the UFC. Right. And uh, he had a gun on him or something. You know, I don't know if he actually brought it up. I'll tell you right now what this all stems from his chicken live chicken is chip. No job's going to drop some fucking chicken head signs. Have you never heard shot? He's like, oh, he hit that beautiful fun. He took it as he took the Jab. He spun and landed at all. But just loving it and look at it. Oh, nice. Left Hook. Next slide. Oh, I need, oh right hand by honey. Jason. Great. Right button. Proud to just outfit. Oh, well this is a great fight. They said, defense, you're outta here. Let's just throw it. They let it go. Brendan shot. We'll give a master course under shaking heads, shaking heads one oh was he will hear your version and chicken heads. It's a lot of people out there that will ruin their fucking life with the wrong person. You hang out with the wrong people. Brendan Walsh would teach her how to avoid chicken heights. Simple Walsh. I say it all the time. Brendan Frasier, who's Brendan Brennan? Wallace.

Speaker 2:          00:22:07       Brendan Frasier. Brendan Schaub apparently has a piece on him. Heard that from girl. Mm. I believe you have a, you should do like one of those late night infomercials on chicken. It's chicken heads. Do you have chicken and just show a bunch of like different scenarios. What would that song you could use you to hear his song on your one album? Boudou per nanny. It was kind of stuff that guys, that was good. That wasn't terrible. It's just a good song. It was that day. Oh, you got to hear it. That's a good song. Don't tell yourself, well, you know we haven't talked. We haven't been in since UFC one 73 Oh yeah. Tj Dillashaw. Damn. Those incredible, right. Inspiring. Look at how he eats the jab and spins. Ooh, what was a right hand? He ate the right hand. Oh, nice. Jumping knee. To really wild fight. Why Walmart?

Speaker 2:          00:22:54       Mario ain't having it. Come on. He's excited. Yeah, they were just going to high five. You know we get chilled though there. They enjoyed the fight. They didn't join it. I says God did. Yeah. I like when the dudes do that. They must have trained before together. Oh No, they're just having a great fucking time. They're just having a great fucking time. That was a while. Wouldn't do that. Mr. Brennan Shab. Most boxers wouldn't do that either. A lot of people wouldn't do that. It's rare. You know what might happen? Like one half of 1% of all UFC fights. Risky kick. When you do that could you could catch an elbow. You know why you don't do that? You ever seen Pat Barry vs Mirko Cro cop when he kept hugging and grabbing each other's nuts and shit. Yeah, but you don't do very extreme. That was a very extreme version of, well, I'm just saying. That's one example. I don't, then I had to fight Mirko Cro cop after that. Not The way you show respect man. What do you mean like show respect? I beaten him up by bringing it to them, not by high five them and have them sign your shorts inside the octagon.

Speaker 2:          00:23:53       That's what I do. I'd be friends with everybody. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. No, I know what you're saying. You can be friends afterwards. Yeah. Well I think Pat Barry was actually good friends with Mirko Cro cop. Right. They trained together, but still get it. I get it. I and Andre Arlovski. You train together. You think we're high fiving? Nah. You think we're touching gloves? Nope. Well, were you friends with her? Lawsky we were good training partners, man. Did you guys ever go looking for honeys? Hey, you are fighting for chicken heads. He was, he had it. He had a girl. You're a good person. He had when when you went to touch gloves. He goes, no, we'll do it afterwards. It did. Wow. Then he woke up. I tried shaking his hand. He didn't want to, Geez. Oh pokes. God. It's the worst fucking so what do they do about it?

Speaker 2:          00:24:35       There's nothing you can really do about it. Did you have to change those gloves? Man. That's one thing to make all curved. Make the gloves so that it accentuates the hand. Why curves? Yup. That's a nice shot there. Oh God. Enjoy your victory. One fricken, I write in the fuck. Oh Man. It's such a terrible injury that you know what I also think, I think they haven't exhausted all the possibilities as far as like covering the tips of the fingers. Everybody says you have to have the fingers open. What about covering the tips was like a very thin sort of like a piece of tough leather or grappling, bro. Well, this is what I'm thinking. Wouldn't it actually, if it was like Suede or something along those lines, what did it actually probably give you just a little more grounded, right? They would come off. No, no, I'm not saying it's thimbles.

Speaker 2:          00:25:24       I'm saying the front end of the glove, the way it's constructed. Some sorta like lambskin or some sort of pliable. Something's flyable little not, not like kangaroo kangaroo lambskin. I've never tried one. Yeah, no. Yeah, I have. They make clothes out of it too though. They make. They make sauce. Smells like it. Smells like soup. You've tried it didn't break off. I'm a little confused on what he's talking about. Condoms. Lambskin condoms. Have you ever tried them? I have never heard of him. I have never heard any more because they have microscopic holes. Get HIV, can get through it. In Africa it was the original condom. The original condoms are made out of animal like in depth sense. Yeah, totally. Yeah. I mean that's what they use. You guys have bang in animal intestines actually feel way better apparently. Yeah. I'm all set on that Bro. I'm all set. That's why the Lens, another podcast [inaudible] tried out a real doll. They went, they took turns on the real doll on the shop. Had the real dawn in another room like like in that room, whatever and were miked and

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       they took turns on the real though. I don't think, I think Howard got the mouth. I think that's all he was like, I'll do it, but you got to carry you the mouth. Everybody gets a different, I'd love to hear Brian. Good fight. Yeah. Got, sorry man. Sorry guys. There's guys out there that hang out and doubled team real dollars. You gotta get your own Bro. You know what? They're too expensive. I guarantee there's two dudes have right now. Listen to this podcast. Double teaming. Some dogs all jacked up on bulletproof coffee. I got to be right. There's gotta be dudes in a parties with it. Like fuck it. Let's do it like one dude. He could afford like a real good one. I'll tell you what my post fight party is right now. Well they have

Speaker 1:          00:27:29       these websites where these guys take the real dolls and dress him up and a, I'm mocked it and this is how I know I used to, I just think it was funny to make fun of real dolls. But then this dude told me, oh he get poked to no, he's blowing his nose. They told me, um, this guy sent me an email like angry at me and then I sent him an email back. Like, Hey, you know, look, I'm just trying to be funny. I'm sorry if it hurt your feelings, you know, but you realize it's kind of funny like the people, cause he was like in love with it. Well he has, it's his girlfriend, you know, and these guys they draw, treat these things like they're the girlfriend. So then he explained to me that he's who's disfigured when he was young and his whole life has been like lonely and sad women find him disgusting and that that's a lot of the guys in this community.

Speaker 5:          00:28:13       Oh Shit. That's kind of heartbreaking. It's totally a different point of view. I would definitely have a doll. I was fucked up and cause he really interesting. I think I was taking it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28:23       In terms of, you know, like some crazy dude cause angst. That's a girl and that it's some, it's you're a madman. If you think that's a girl.

Speaker 5:          00:28:31       Well that's a different situation. I was, I was thinking if you're a regular duty of your shit together and you're going home taking out a doll, you need a fucking motivational talk, man. Send me a text and I'll give you a motivational talk. What's the whole fucking movie where a dude fell in love with Ryan Gosling called Lars and the real girl as I don't know, but uh, that movie her where she fought, where he falls in love with the, I love that movie. It was so good. There's got to be 70 of them. He's like a pimp. He has them all out in his living room and shit. He comes out with a fucking smoking jacket and he's got all these real dogs. He sleeps with like 10 of them and shit. Oh for sure. It was going to be the oldest one, at least one did. And all the guys in his community there like jealous of them and shit. Fuck. He's got so many shit. Those things are expensive. There's got to be guys out there they want, they just can't afford one. They just $10,000 for their 10 g's or something like that. Five G's. 10 genes. That's a lot of money. Yeah. They're probably pretty expensive. We weren't even paying attention a little bit. I'll do

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       worse than the fucking judges in Vegas if you try to judge that. I was actually watching. I got to know Jason. I got Jason. You would not watch it. I was to be other people's real dolls off like breaking in and stealing and shit. Like give me back my real dog. They break in while he's at work, they break in flower. Real brands have a tenant. They just, my friends have to evict this tenant from their, from their apartment because the guy was breaking the other tenants, uh, spit it out. Apartments the other women and stealing their clothes and all those women who are going, I'm missing my clothes. What's going on? So one girl put up video cameras and the guy was breaking in during the day, stealing. So they get to his place and these guys just bins, bins full of women's stuff and he dresses up in his house and walks around and Oh my God, that's what he's into.

Speaker 4:          00:30:35       And now, now the cops, you know, you're crazy. If you don't take an order, a doll, it looks like Joe Rogan and guys are fucking it. I'm crazy. Even crazier than that. How about the fact that they're going to have artificial robot bodies that you can fuck right there that's going to happen. Where can we find out where they're at? Are they close, slow? With synthetic biology, they might be able to make great. That's very real feeling robots. It could be a person. I mean, you could essentially be an artificial person, so you're going to be able to fuck a Brendan Schaub. You'll be able to fuck big foot Silva [inaudible] gay dudes.

Speaker 4:          00:31:20       They just maybe so just want to get savaged by my bad ass dude. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I bet. I bet you could probably order real dolls that looked like scarlet Johanson and show. Yeah, well, yeah, but I think you're going to be able to order an exact duplicate of scarlet Johannson. I mean, it's going to be so strange. Stupid. That's the world's going to be stupid. I would order one if it was affordable and reasonable. If you talk to someone who lived in the 14 hundreds about Internet porn on your phone, they would look at you. Look, you were completely raw. He Won. Peralto. Wow, that doesn't make sense. Big Win. Well, I don't know if you were to really truly paying attention there. We were talking about definitely not watching it enough to accurately judge a fight. What is high a Bussa it's a company that makes clothes closing gear. Yeah. Boxing gloves and shit. Good gear down. Yeah. I don't know. Did they pay you Brian to say that he has say $10,000. Here's a random, here's a, I don't know how to sit and see this, but you weren't really, totally none of that landed that move of the night. None of those landed. Nope. Nope. Nope. He's going against. So that couldn't have hurt you made the I didn't hurt. It didn't me.

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       It was a good fight. It was a really good point. Did anyone watch the uh, the fridge and groves boxing match? No, but I watched the knockout. Good flight. Yeah. I didn't use case. Biggest boxing match all tiny thousand people. [inaudible] stadium. Crazy man. The biggest of all time. Isn't that funny? That Kroll fraud is so big over in England, but people in America, the average sports fan is no idea. I don't know. I'll tell you who knows who he is. His girl, she is dime piece of the girl and he won that belt, but his girl jumped in there. Everyone was like, Dang. Dang. Lang Lang a frosh. His girlfriend, she's, he's winning. He is winning everybody. Yes. God is real strange. You know I was on the, on a plane with Vladimir Klitschko and nobody bothered him at all. Insane. Right? He walked in, he sat down, nobody knew who he was and I was like, Holy Shit.

Speaker 2:          00:33:28       And so I'm like watching to see if people tweak and start pointing at him nothing and go, Holy Shit. That's the heavyweight champion of the world. Nope. Not a single person who was white, but in Europe all over, he can't go anywhere. He's like, Tom Cruise here. He could deliver your pizza. You're like, oh, what's up dog? Well, he lives in Germany and him and his brother, they did a lot of time in Germany. They lived in Germany for a long time and they, they speak German and they were like beloved in Germany. Smart Dude. Yeah. Really smart. They're fucking PhDs. Yeah. It's kind of crazy that guys with super high education would be the hazy on the eyes. Too easy on the eyes. Perfect genetics. No big deal. Yeah. But you know, he lost a bunch of times. He's an interesting case man. He lost a bunch of times and uh, another eye gouge man.

Speaker 2:          00:34:12       What do you know at a certain point time man, someone's got to do something about these guys. Part of the sport. Right. Is it though? I mean he can this like people getting kicked in the nuts. You'd be like, man, we have to stop ice or take it out. A way to do it though. If you ever tried one of those a diamond cups, those diamond and my makeup's nope. You told me about it last time. I thought I was going to get one in the mail. I get you one. I'm going to every techstars, these diamond directly in the balls every single time. Dude goes, hold on a second. Hold on. Hold on one second. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:34:41       Off the top of my head. Oh, there we go. Two matches that ended with ball shots. Oh yeah. Underlay Gilbert. Ival remember that pride 11, he kicked him in the balls and he just couldn't recover cause his ball got caught and guys were never the same man. Kind of have to kick him. Most of the time though in MMA from, from what I remember, you get kicked in the balls. That doesn't end. The fight might, they might be true. You get five minutes to recover Gilbert idol. It was done in one that, and I didn't recover from that when his ball was sticking out. Oh, got crushed. And that's the only one I remembered. You guys remember any fight ended because of a bunker shot. I don't fight fights end because of I got this right. How many invented and you can detach. We'll get them out. Anthony Johnson ended because of the eye gouge. The Anthony Johnson fight was, it was a bad one. Phil Davis, uh, fought that one dude. Brazil. Yeah, that's what they stopped the fight veto. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       who has a [inaudible] against a grand tour, but that was a different thing. That was actually a good lunch slice. The upper eyelid like his eyelid was open, like you could like could keep his eyes closed. You could see his eyeball through us. Yeah. And it was from a punch, like the grazing of the uh, side of the glove did that, I think you just got to chalk it up, man. Part of the sport. You say that, but have they looked at all the options? Because I feel like people can figure something out. First of all, Tim Kennedy said they should use the pride gloves. Jamie, go, go grab some there. They're in the back. I had him. I just for this, uh, for this discussion they cover the fingers a little more, a little more, but they accentuate the curve. Apparently according to Jackie Kennedy keep you in this position, whereas the UFC gloves, you actually have to stress to close your hand.

Speaker 1:          00:36:29       Here it is right here. This is the, this is the official Prague love. This is from Brian London. Real what? That makes sense, right on real curve. If you want to straighten it, you can, but you've got to force it. Yes, that's a very good, well, and then Everlast recently developed a glove for Bella tour that they're allowing the UFC to use. There's definitely more covering the fingers. Everlast the rapper, like my man is a bad motherfucker entrepreneur. Um, he um, they developed a, a a glove, the Bella towards using where it covers like it makes the hand bend more. I get some more formed like a fist and Allen and yeah. But yeah, I think even more so maybe even better than the pride one. But the uh, the pride when our like the fingers don't spread apart as much. Like look, when you open your hand, put Po, hold your hand up like that. See it seems like, it seems like there's a little more coverage of the fingers a little bit more, a little longer, a little longer. Damien Maia, Alexander Jako Lev, who is him? What his big so beautiful. I don't know. I don't, I'm not aware. Um, I'll look it up real quick. But this a real, the struggle is real to get this glove on. But

Speaker 5:          00:37:45       is there more padding on these though then in UFC gloves and look three tickets and they go on. I want to just start walking around and thinking of the same way. What is it legit. I box today with Wayne McCullough. You, I've been boxing a lot this week. Yes I have. They do have a little more patent on the front. Like you said, your hands are curved. You want to hear something random, you know the nods commercial with the, uh, the guy with the Mohawk who gets knocked out and the guy, I took a lesson at revolution MMA in a, in Toronto from that guy who knocks him out the Moitai lesson. It was really cool. Yeah. And you know Joe Gerson, Joe the Guy [inaudible] Satoh you're that guy.

Speaker 5:          00:38:33       You're steering. Your stories are hurting, bro. I'm trying to, when we talked about it last night when we talked about last out of the instructors and the guy is the guy, you're the good, listen, listen, there's a million guys out there who train and we're tap out shirts that look exactly. That was him. He was him. Well that's what he told you like I have no, we talked about it. That's a claim to fame. People get mad when you call it like there's people aligned to get mad when we do fun. Brian. Oh, I know bullying. You're bullying Brian. I know you guys bully Brian. There's a, you have a reputation for that. Yes, we did

Speaker 2:          00:39:19       podcasts. We did. We actually got tweets that were accusing us of people don't understand ball busting. Like I don't know if you guys don't have to. Yeah, but you guys who are freaking out because we bust each other's balls. Yeah, go get some friends. Also also also very sensitive if you haven't noticed. Yeah, well you don't understand. He likes it like half of the reason why he acts retarded, so they will call them on it. It's not so subtle. It's not very subtle, ladies and gentlemen, if you're freaking out and attaching that much to do too, obviously like hanging out with each other. I don't know. Maybe you have friends at home that you don't really like and we'll try. I mean, I do go home and cry,

Speaker 5:          00:39:54       but that's not the case. Brian cries at night. I do in my hands or you can come down to abot. Kenny,

Speaker 2:          00:39:59       you're down there. Let you feel like Brian Killen. You'll show me around. Mr Kellan can have some of that delicious one. I friend. I, that's what I brought it for. Eddie. Do you want some wine? Because somebody is training right now so they can't have it. Mr a man. I'll tell ya Brandon shop don't get his way when he's hungry. Oh, less than two weeks away. Brendan. Shop go time go time. How you a baby? Good man. Ready to go. I've never been more excited for a flight.

Lincoln Park did. They can park. Yeah. Holy Shit. It's dope. Dana white tweeted out. Yeah, they played it on the wall. You're obviously working, but they played it on a UFC one 73 and I was watching it with some buddies and um, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:40:46       Things got real. It's like, Oh shit, we're two weeks away here, boy. Ready Baby. Wow. Your main card, right? Yeah, of course. Just like asking dumb questions. Yeah. Yeah. Why don't you play it and have you found it? I mean, he'd go Lincoln Park, UFC one 74 standard. Lincoln busted a, an acoustic set. Not going to lie. It wasn't who I love. Lincoln Park Acoustic. Anyways, they played this promo and a, yeah, I didn't say a word for this and I kind of went never back down. MMA motivation feature in Lincoln Park. Is that it? Nah. You'll see one 74 promo UFC one 74 promo. Okay. We find get lift and, hold on, hold on. Alright. Prom. Well there you go. Yeah, that's it. Wastelands what's that waste? It's called Lincoln Park Wasteland. Okay. Slap that bitch on. Okay, I'll do it here. Yeah. Wastelands

Speaker 6:          00:41:41       and then you see out stack. This card is one 74 that it is. Anyway, back to my story about taking a lesson from, would you say that,

Speaker 5:          00:41:52       okay,

Speaker 6:          00:41:55       now you got to go back and you click the wrong video. I did go backwards. It was the second one.

Speaker 5:          00:42:02       Yeah, that's it. Wait, hold on.

Speaker 2:          00:42:07       What's that? Yeah, I muted it already. The second one. Wastelands preview. Okay, here we go. Yeah, that's it. Wasteland. There it is. I don't give a shit. Where am I hearing that? You got to hear the music, man. This isn't it. Why is this your truck? Can I shut this off? I'm gonna shut the Ustream off.

Speaker 6:          00:42:33       Where am I hearing that from? Chinese. What? This guy is six three one 70 what's that

Speaker 2:          00:42:37       tall man? Oh, there's two windows open. That's what it is. Okay. Let me play this for you guys to wastelands preview. Hope Damien Maia uses Jujitsu.

Speaker 6:          00:42:48       I hit has been striking lately. Drives me nuts.

Speaker 5:          00:42:50       The volume is down on that youtube browser to, Oh, is it?

Speaker 2:          00:43:01       Well, let's play this when the fights out on good call. Cause I'm, I'm a mess here. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

Speaker 6:          00:43:08       Nah, y'all come on Damien Maia. It's gotta be a big weight cut for a Damien Maia said it's easier bro. He just fucking one day. How's they get sash? He's got some tits on. Yeah, he gave him, I went on that losing streak because for whatever reason you have this worldclass Jujitsu and they're like, you know what I like striking. I'm not going to take guys down. I just want to strike. Yeah. It's crazy to me. I get on these rugs tag Mark Munoz and hurt him, you know, and I think he fall in love with it, getting better at it, but he still uses it. You just feel like now he is. Now he's at one sandwich store 85 he wasn't. Yeah, the Rick story fight was incredible. I remember when he toss chill Sona and landed in that mounted triangle. I was so sick. Yeah. I think it's so scary for a lot of Brazilian Jujitsu practitioners to get in to MMA and all of a sudden some dude's trying to fucking knock them out.

Speaker 6:          00:44:03       It's scary. So when, when they get to the point where they actually can do it and they're getting hit and they're like, fuck, there's nothing to be scared of. And even though they lose decisions, I think they, I think they like it. You know, I think like Georgia Shell, he's losing decisions, but he's like, fuck, I'm not afraid of this shit. I'm a fucking savage. He's getting hit, he's getting cut up and he just keeps going forward. I think that it feels good to them. He's got [inaudible] feels good or not. It's got some powder and he seems to, uh, and especially

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       when you're awake, guy like Damien, Mike gets knocked out inside the octagon and now we could do it to people. Yeah. Yeah. So I think they, even though they lose a decision, they just liked it. They liked throwing. Here we go. But it's also, you know, you got to realize that a guy like Damien Maia got so fucking good at Jujitsu because he becomes obsessed and he probably just assumes he's going to get that good at striking. He was saying that would be his home base threatening everybody everywhere. Oh yeah. He has got out there with his hands like way better, way better, way better. He's moving. He looks much more like a striker. Yup. There's that weird way that grapplers move when you know they can't strike it all. It's real awkward. Very stiff. Yeah. But when you see a guy get that certain fluidity to them and it's, it's weird. Like it doesn't always translate that way cause some guys look kinda awkward, but they're really good strikers. I Love Damien Maia because, uh, I was at a real low point in my life when I was fighting in Brazil and I was again, asa yet like two in the morning after I fought Nogueira and uh, he came up, give me a big hug in front of all these people. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, man. That's cool. Really cool. Yeah. It's a very nice guy, but certain stuff you don't forget, you know? Yeah. No, that's very cool, man.

Speaker 2:          00:45:40       So He's doing rolled his Jab, popping that jab out there, but he hasn't been able to get ahold of this. Russian dude is a master of sport in both sides. Mastering, sporting what? Master's son. It's over master of sport and Sabo and Jujitsu or it's awesome. Although that's over big elbow. Good luck in him off of Mount. Yeah. Yeah. Two and a half minutes to build sales mountain is sick. It's a building.

Speaker 7:          00:46:09       Oof.

Speaker 2:          00:46:10       Damien Maia said tax book. She just tell you right now time, what are the odds that this guy survives this round? What are the odds? I'd say they're 50% because our sport and Sambo and a master sport and wrestling, I say less than 30% if you think there's going to be over, yes. You got to bet money. Yes. I like that guy. He's a, he's been, this is a confidence. 10 Bucks, 10 bucks right now that he'll survive. Okay, I'll take that. But Hey, 10 bucks. I say nope. Oh, Damien, I'll bet both of you. So, okay. I'm saying, I'm saying he's going to survive. How do I say the homeboy totally survived? Yeah. I say survive. Survive. He looks fresh right now. Look, you always got to do is he's going to take Joe's Alamos. He's definitely, he could get stopped but I think it's a little bit better than 50% of make it.

Speaker 2:          00:46:57       It's got a minute 30. He's going to say he's going to survive. You guys come on days session dues are tough as shit son. I'm still as hard Tom, you got 20 bucks. Shit, 20 bucks on the line. Yeah, I do. Yeah. There's so many of these cats that are Yossi and in um, there's also guys, it's a belt or too, there's some sick Russians over there as well. I'll tell you right now when this dude was getting ready for the game plan for Damien Maia, they said he's a first round. Do not let him get on top of you all. It did set the fan, but it's still, he's got a minute and got caught. He got

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       plenty of time for a sick ass arm bar and he said he might corners and go 30 seconds. You like that though? Up against the cage. Like that makes it tough. Yeah, it makes it tough. I have a win win situation because if I lose your money, that means Damien Maia. One second to go on in the wind. So come on. Damon's gonna win, but he's going to win in the second and third is not going to finish. Dude is too far. He's scared to tell you that man. Oh, big elbows. Elbows are ferocious. Oh, missed him. Estimates that s grip was pretty triangle coming up. Sun Hot Triangle coming up. Hoss Triangle. You got him down. He guys got it down though. He's creeping up on the case. He's going to try to get that is going to try to get his leg under his head. Oh, right on man.

Speaker 4:          00:48:18       He's trying for that. Right? All right. I thought he had it looked like he was going to set up front. Triangle. Elbows are ferocious. I'm a slow triangle, right? That slow triangle, right triangle, right. That bloom. Damien Maia. Damn. You can't spin to the, to the [inaudible]. No, he can't save it. Save it. We're going to, we're going to get a ride.

And we got Gary Tone in at one 70. Remember the match we talked about him and Kron Gracie Gary Tone and is the number one seat at 70 and at one 45, Jeff Glover, he's like, Oh shit, he's number one at one 45. So basically he's a beast. I got some 10 plan of black belts that are basically going to probably end up in the finals. Surprise. It's going to be Gary or Gary Tonin against Boogie maybe. Or uh, if Gary Tone and even gets by Nathan Orchard, one of my black belts. Who knows what happens, but it's, it's going to be

Speaker 2:          00:51:15       either way and grant match, by the way, Damien [inaudible] boy pat situation, you got him down with diem now. Now let's see. Let's see, mountain, anyone in the division, he gets down. No one wants to take it back. I love the guy doesn't get out of this round guys. I say he finishes him right here. No, I agree. I think he's going to fit. It's going to finish. What do you think he's gonna Finish them or survive? He three minutes. No, no. He's going to finish him. I think he's going to finish him. I'm a contrarian is not going to finish him. Do it. Rushed out. This guy cannot get out from under the mountain. Brian. This is like watching a blue belt versus a black to that situation. And I'm not saying that this guy's a blue belt, but I'm saying Damien Maia would do the same to so many black belts, right?

Speaker 2:          00:51:56       Yes, he's, he's so God damn good. Don't anything helping. This guy is the cage. If the cage wasn't there, Maya would be doing some serious work if they were in the center. Yeah. Frank Mir told me that he you like, this is like Frank Mir is God damn black belt, right? Everybody says Frank Mir was buck, but he told me after he rolled with with Damien, mind goes, I'm not really a black vote cause I'm like a brown belt chase. It's really said that, wow, you can't believe how good this guy come on. And he said he's a 1% or does he tap frank Mir though? I don't know he, I didn't ask that. That's disrespectful. How dare you. Right. But frank is a, you know, he's a super smart dude. Like if you've never had a conversation with Frank Mir, he's very smart, very well read, very well read guy and very honest too.

Speaker 2:          00:52:35       Like he's not a bullshit artist. So like when he's, he's telling you about how good Maya is. It's come from a good, he's a good, easily he trapped that. Did you sweat that? That, that, that move with the guard was trying to hip escape and how beautifully Maya made that transition back to full mount like this inevitable. Now he's got him in the middle. He's got an Mlo who put everything into trying to get out of that fucking mouth. Look how good Maya's mount is. This hooks. He's just controlling his legs, his knees when he throws the exploding. Just taking it all. I've got that arm. See he's not going to, you can't get out of that shit like you can with another guy's arm triangle. Damien Maia has wicked positioning like, look how good he's close position. Taking the back. Taking the back hook. Oh Damn. I lost it. Oh, shocked. Okay. He makes it out of this round

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       now. The guy's going to make it out or argue with me guys. Yeah, he's got to make it out there about me. I know. Fighting. Um, he's going to take them down. Maya's rustling. It's pretty on point now. Now. Oh, look at this knee attack is this guy's game. Oh Damn. He's got a name. He's got a good team. Yeah. He's got an arm in. Oh No, no. He doesn't have shit. I mean, the only that's not going to work on, got an order over. He might switch a dark. He's got to be just exhausted, I think. Yeah. Mine was exhausted. I mean, he really got, has a submitting Maya's if this guy is no fucking joke, man. His, his Jujitsu is no joke though man. It's good defense. Good defense. Get in and out of that arm triangle. You know he, I mean he couldn't get out of Damien's mouth, but look, he's still here.

Speaker 4:          00:54:08       He surviving. He's going to get swept here. Let's see. Double under hooks with full guard though. He's not trying to sweep and we just hanging on. He tried to his body. It never makes sense to me. The MMA, when guys triangle the body from the, not from the ground, from the back, from the back of the Mat. Totally. But from guard, what are you trying to get? Trying to hang on. That's what I think he's trying to do. I think he's trying to decide the rest. Yeah. If you go for a body, like he's letting it loose here, but if you go for a body triangle and full guard, you're not trying to set up a submission. Do you literally can't do anything. You could start any to stall. You could let it go yourself show. The thing about it is you could let it go yourself like so say yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:54:46       So say if like a, if a gay teen presented itself, you could always get back to full guard, right? You could use the real full guard if somehow or another you could catch some pain or sickness to do that. A lot. He was, he is at the most wholesome strikers are just like, you ain't passing this guard. Never and you just cross your ankles and the guy has a good knee slice. He could open that shit up. But when you were putting on the triangle you're saying, I ain't trying to shit, I'm just going to hold you and sometimes you need to do that. If one of my fighters as well, it's mostly a striker and his Jujitsu with just coming along and he, he was in some amateur MMA fight, I'd say. Yeah figure for his fucking body. You know, you don't try no triangles or I think as a pass your guard, if you fuck up, you'll see high level guys own the UFC in the first round, the do somebody triangles, which is, it's always crazy me, is all, they'll be losing the fight and they'd be like second round, third round, and they do body triangles. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:55:36       tobacco from the guard, from the guard, from the guards, weird from the band. Same from the back is going to happen. In other words, you know you're losing the fight, right? It's so critical. It's like stolen and you're taking away two of your weapons anyway, but really he's losing the fight and he's like, and this shit's looking really bad. I'm on my back. I'm very, I'm not very good on my back. I'm not going to let it get worse. I'm going to put on a triangle. That's what they're thinking. I'm not going to let it get any worse. It's getting really bad right now. Rather survive with the guy and the guard. Then have the guy pass a mountain and then really take them out to see loved guy's tough man. Let's see if he comes on to third round. He said just hit Damien. Maia would a hard fucking leg kick I think. Stop forgetting six three. What the hell happened there? Wow. It's just tough feedback. Damien Maia is uh, he's tired man. He exerted a lot of energy

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       trying to finish in that side and I think the one 70 cuts tough form and we've seen them have us. Uh, what's your walk around 200 pounds or something? He's a big boy. Yeah, he really love, love. Just nailed. Why walks one 90? He's tired. He's tired. Holy Shit. No doubt y'all gloves trying to wear him out. That's why too. Wow. He's pushing them right now. Yaka level looks way more. Way more fresh. You got to get the first two rounds of Damien. Oh no doubt. He has to finish. He's going to lose this fight. If he just asked you leg kicks though. He hit him with three hard leg kicks in this round.

Speaker 8:          00:57:00       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:57:00       let's see if he can land some strikes is kind of interesting, man. I love shifts. You know, that's what makes fight so interesting. When you see a guy pull, pull victory out of the jaws of defeat, figure out a way to get out of a hole like you thought homeboys just can get dominated that those get finished in the first round. Yeah, look at him. Here he is and the third.

Speaker 8:          00:57:22       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:57:23       and Damien Maia can't touch him and he hits him again. Boom. Know Maya's these hurt dude. I got my leg massage today and I almost tapped out getting a massage. I a woman on your idea of a guide on the side of your leg. My calves on a lady who knows how to use her elbows. Right. She's, she's really knowledgeable, really knowledgeable in to Damien. Maia is getting fucked up with his leg and eat up. I mean, I don't know how many of these he's going to be able to do what? He can't feel them right now, but it's definitely taken a toll on, but you really can't feel him. You won't be able to walk tomorrow. I bet. Yeah. I think you're probably right. Look at this time again son. Oh my God. This is going to win him the fight for sure. No doubt he's not getting up.

Speaker 2:          00:58:10       The only way this guy's ever getting out of this position of Zip Maya goes for an arm bar. And why would he go for an arm bar if he's dominated the first two rounds? If he's this tired, he's tired. No, but I feel like in that first round he should've went for something man. Yeah. I got an arm bar from here. I mean by the web transition methodically. I'm out. Yup. Well why isn't he doing it? Because he doesn't want to. He wants to right now to just punch this guy cause he's tired too hard cause there are a, or if he just doesn't mean he wants to be able to get enough energy for a burst and he wants to be able to get into big issue. Lori's reasonably convinced that he's going to be able to finish it. Right. You know, he just doesn't want to exert everything and wind up in the bottom getting grounded, pounded when the bell wants out.

Speaker 2:          00:58:49       Cause that's what happened in that one round. Right. He got, he got reversed and you know, that's forgot like that. That fucking sucks. No, he doesn't want to feel that he's a dominant ground fighter. That's, that's a terrible feeling that he fucked up and wound up on the bottom that it could have cost him the round. You know, that kind of feeling. But look, his mount is like a goddamn building on your chest. So good. So good. I love seeing it, man. I know some people at home are like, oh, this is so boring. I literally, there's nothing more I like to see when you see a guy who a mount is that God is, you can't see what he's doing. Like he just looks like you look at his feet. It looks like he controls when he goes to explode, he takes one of them away.

Speaker 2:          00:59:28       It's also is his balance and his position. It's what it is, is a lot of it is on knowledge of Jujitsu first knowing what to do in any given circumstance and then thousands of hours. I thought that guy just tapped. What did he just do? It really is just like a wild bull. Exact same thing. The same muscles you see. You see guys lose mount all the time. USC All the time, but world class black belts like Damien Maia, they have that next level type mouse got bucked off because they've been on longer. He's been doing, he's been in this position, you know, since he was thousands of hours since he was sick. So to him this is home and you're saying watch his feet, watch his feet. When this guy goes to explode, he's going to take away one of his hooks. Yeah, look at, look how beautifully transitions, but no, no, no.

Speaker 2:          01:00:16       Look, the guy gets the half guard and boom right into side control and he's going to take us back again. Man. He's got to have medicine. He's got to do something. Is either going to take us back like he gave him the options. He gave him two options. Either you take us back right? Mount you. Yeah, the dude's Coke [inaudible] triangle. He's stepping over right now. He's 20 seconds to go. Let's see if it could pull it. Oh, he's got both arms in though. Man Does. He might do it on a bar and he's going for an arm bar. He lost the arm. Wow. He's still trying to set it up. Switch you still? Yeah, to look at us. He's still spitting on him. I wish you had done then the first round Damien Maia, you owe me $20 the juice is running. You ever see that video?

Speaker 2:          01:00:52       Oh the guys back up on his feet kicked him right. Oh Shit. I was it. Damn the Russian guys she got it has to be frustrated. Mounted for basically nine minutes. The 15 minute fight. It's fucking that guys do do it through. So God damn good. I love it. But I love the fact that Russian dude made it to the end. Yup. Very interesting stuff. This is Steve and these dudes coming over, man. I was talking about this with Henna. I don't people when guys get to mount, some people freak out like all the fights over. It's, it's typically not these days because there's not, there's not a high level Jujitsu going on a lot of the times. So guys get to mountain, they lose it. They just think it's over. Cause they, it's two guys who don't know Jujitsu and there's a big heavy guy and mount and he's gonna Punch his face then.

Speaker 2:          01:01:41       But in most cases guys are getting out these days. I don't think this is dangerous to everyone thinks look, can you just see y'all keep that Russian guy out of the sun in please. Yeah. What burning it starts smoking to say you needs a spray Tan. You see Michael Kesa and um, and train Aldo that that last fight I did not dude. Michael Key. Yes. Has got a Goddamn ground game. Holy Shit. Turn all those obese dude cancer was mountain cam and it was really hard for that dude to get them off of them. As soon as he got him down on the ground. I mean it was just, she asked the ring, the guy adjusting, constantly adjusting suck. Yes. And ultimate fighter. I thought that guy was going to last one second and he ends up winning it. How about Tony Ferguson? Did

Speaker 6:          01:02:19       you see that cocoon and beat the shit out? You know what he told me? You know what Tony told me? I don't, you know, he's a 10th planet Purple Belt, so we talk a lot and he comes to Hbcu every Thursday night. So He's a training at 10th Planet Costa Mesa with Casey. And it comes to rain too. I see him. Yeah, he comes, he, yes. He goes the range as well. He, you know, he says, what do you think about cocoon? I go, my advice was I suggest shit. I'm not going to tell a fighter of my what to do. I'm just going to suggestion. I said, the only way he's going to beat you is standing. He's fucking everybody up. He goes after the liver, you know, cocooned. Oh, a weird dude in his karate style I've ever seen in the UFC. He just, all he does is drop dudes with liver kicks and he's fucking people up.

Speaker 6:          01:03:04       It worked in Japan so well that he got into the UFC and I said, don't fuck around with that. Take his ass down. Tony wrestled in college. I go take him down. Tony's Jujitsu is insane. It's very suited to his judges. Transitions or sick. I was most impressed with cocoon. Oh, that notches. He took those punches, but he got out of that Doris. Then I talked to Tony afterwards. He was like, I don't, it wasn't, he wasn't squeezing. Right. You just want to get, I'm tired. His heart rate up. Right, so this is what he told me. I said, I would take them down. Go, what do you want it? I just don't fuck around. Don't give them a shot. Take them down. And he said, you know what? I'm going to dot them up a little bit and I think, you know, play with them a little bit.

Speaker 6:          01:03:41       Then I'm going to take him down and some metal. I said, that's what you want to do. Go for it. I'm like, you're going to, you're going to dance around with this guy who's dropping fool after full with liver shots. You're going to give them a shot. I go, go for it. That's how he's fucking like Conan the barbarian. Yeah. He does exactly that. He dots among exactly where they took him down, owned them on the ground, and then stood up a shock them the fucking out with a big right hand and then he got tagged in the first round. It cuno tagged them cocoon. I was one of those guys. You can get one shot to try and find them right. And you're not going to duplicate that in the training room. You get one live shot at this dude. Honestly, I gotta be honest.

Speaker 6:          01:04:16       I was laughing at him. You could go, you could get a guy. I cocooned. There's his fighting style. There's Saint Japan homie. You get punched right in the face. Tony, Tony Ferguson and Tony Ferguson. Tony is a monster. I've been in, I've been in the end, the main industry since I've been getting paid working in the MMA history since 2000 yeah, I seen a lot of motherfuckers come and go. I seen fighters coming to go fight camps, come and go. Apparel, MMA, apparel companies coming. I seen working backstage at the UFC for eight years. You see them come and go and see him coming down. Seriously. I've never met anybody like Tony Ferguson. I never met anybody like him is he really is like an operation 40 secret aside, he was born to do this. He's doing in the game. I've never seen anybody studied the game. Man, cat dude. He just breaks shit down and puts, he is learning Jujitsu at such a rapid pace. He's got all these transitions that him and Casey are putting together and they just, they come up on Thursdays and they show me what they've been working with. I'm like, they're putting

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       insane stuff together. There's, there's not too many guys. I'll stop and watch spar. Right, because I have an ego. There's not to cause that to me guys who you are. Stop and watch spar, but tone. It wouldn't. Tony spires. I'll watch to see Jack's dudes are really, yeah. I like your when kick comes a gym I can we fight to get me. He's like too and I'm like, Oh, who spoiled with Tony? I'm like, excellent. I'll you're my rounds and just watch it destroys these. Then I'm going to dot this dude up a little brash as a killing. Everybody might, even if the guys who it is, I'm going to go, hey bro, just say, you know, I'm going to die.

Speaker 5:          01:05:58       He was, he got his back, hit them up and one of those like Kevin Randleman Fay door slam. It was an epic before I die or I die. Hey Bro, just say, you know, can do it like that. You're going to be like that whole, that the new standard. It gets knocked out by some young cause you would think life is a fucking movie. I want to try that out by the way, just so everyone knows what I, the way, when I hit 55, I'm going on the juice. Good again. I'm going to shave down. Go on the juice, get a second hair trend. They say they say that could Pluto has a successful uh, MMA apparel. Uh, yes. Store in Japan. I bet people are going in there and be like, hey bro, you think that, uh, is there any styles? The best way to go? It's good in Japan.

Speaker 5:          01:06:47       He's right. Kill him. Karuna Japan killing guys. But it's all about levels. Like there's dudes who were killing guys in other organizations and then they get into the UFC and you realize that your friend, and you look really good when you're fighting B level fighters. But when you get in there with an a level fighter, you're going to get fucked up. You got to have all your fucking t's crossed, all your I's dotted. And some guys just don't. And when your hands are down by your Dick and you moving around like you're in a karate movie, you're really, you don't have to, you know, you have a unique thing you're doing. And it was super, literally my brothers call me, we were laughing, we laughed at him. He tagged Tony in the first [inaudible]. That's what I'm saying for Tony, it's such a dangerous fight because you only get one life shot at then and the dude hits hard as hell.

Speaker 5:          01:07:31       He does. So it's like so you better bring your a game or you can get drunk. But Tony was, once Tony got comfortable, Tony started lighting them up and once you figured out that stance like, oh, this is in the style of really done. That's when I hit that swim move off the back, got him into spider. Spiderweb was fuck, got to see this. It's an amazing, nice, nice. How long did, how long ago? I really see he switched around it first of Oh, very end of the first round. That's right. I really wish you would have finished. I believe we're going to see Tony Ferguson versus like Anthony Pettis and Ben Henderson. Gilbert Melendez. I think he's that fucking good. He's a lot bigger than those too and his though at the rate he's getting his Jujitsu. I mean his Jitsu is like, do you guys roll? Did you teach Casey and all the attention to what the fuck are you saying? Earlier I was explaining with the Tony [inaudible] every Thursday I was explaining you weren't paying attention to right now Brian. He was waiting as well. Chuck Ladell. That's what I was watching, waiting for his, his time to talk. Chuck Chuck Norris right there. He's the real chuck Norris Dude. Great. A great commercial

Speaker 2:          01:08:41       and he's wearing toenail polish the whole time. Oh, fantastic test. That was like a zone. The dos Equis most interesting man on the highest level.

Speaker 5:          01:08:53       That was interesting when you're talking about levels though, and when you get to the higher level, shop.in fundamentals, fundamentals where everything was not impressed with the Chuck Norris Commercial. Brendan Schaub duck breast, you didn't like that commercial. Get bigger than that. It was like the biggest, you can get that kid, but that's not what it's all about. He's like, that shit is ridiculous. We're going to give you $1 million. We got this concept for this commercial. You wouldn't be trying to argue with the director. You would just fucking dad be doing some bull shit. I be fucking [inaudible]. I don't have a problem.

Speaker 2:          01:09:33       It all because it's so unrealistic, you know, slamming your head into a wrecking ball. It's so over the top. You get the point. Yeah. The car stops in the midair and he just steps out kind of like, you know, you got your shorts branding up real dog. That'd be dope. With a silhouette of a real dog. I thought about getting a guy real doll and using them as a Jujitsu dummy. I'm like, what would be a better thing to use? But you'd have to explain. Do you have to call it factory? I don't want to know.

Speaker 5:          01:10:01       [inaudible] Dick [inaudible] additional income. You rent it out. But guys want to give you just cause you owned it, it was your real dot. Now, $10,000. Just a session. Find my DNA cash. You call back and you go, I one hall. But that's where I draw the line. Just one off. If a dude let me give you $1 million to borrow your cash, you would do it. What fucker guy and hard to [inaudible]. You kidding me? A mill. What are you going to do? I'll take some value. That's not what I was asking. You didn't. Uh,

Speaker 2:          01:10:49       he was saying if someone used your real doll would, if someone said, if he had a real doll, a male one, and some guy gay offered him $1 million to bone it. Oh, this is the piece. Hold on. Turn the volume up on this. Jamie. I want to hear. This is a piece on the alieve bag routine off dude, who's whose names are harder to remember? The Russians or the Japanese? Which ones? I think it's even as a kid is such a beast. Yeah, he's gonna Fight Demetrius Mighty

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       Mouse Johnson though. Dude Johnson some next level shit. But he's training with John Dodson in that picture. They just showed them. Yeah, he trains at Jackson's, right? Yeah. He's won for 11 straight. He's the best little Russian. Oh, he's a man. He's a beast. He's a legit contender. No doubt. But I think if you want to talk about number one pound for pound guys to meet you. Gotta you gotta fucking include this guy. No one's including them. I include them in every list. All I hear is John Jones, who spectacular Joe say Aldo, who's amazing, but you've got to include this dude in your pound for pound list. He does everything perfect. He's fucking takedowns are lightening fast. His submissions, he knocked out Benevidez with one punch. He's, he's wicked bro. He finished fucking Baraga in a war of four round war and then he finishes him with an arm bar.

Speaker 1:          01:12:03       He's the most well rounded fighter in the sport. He's the most dust. Everything black belt level. Yes. Everything black belt level and his technique and everything is flawless. Everything is by the book. There's no wasted energy, you know? But Bagua teen off is a fucking beast, man. He's a big dude. He's strong as shit for 125 pounds too. I mean, I don't know what he weighs when he actually gets into that octagon at that boom. I feel like the little guys are way more happier to get in the octagon and fight. Right. Well thanks. So you think they're more happy? Yeah. Were they finally get one of the Hindu decision you to death? You know what I'm saying? These little guys, chances you getting finished aren't very good really. You? You're amazing. He is not. He knocked out morale. I mean he submitted Moraga with an arm bar and saying it's different overall.

Speaker 1:          01:12:49       I gotta agree with Brenden [inaudible] smaller guys and those guys. And you can get knocked out with a jab if you're a heavy heavyweight division. Much nicer. I know what you're saying. I feel you. I mean, I can I get, can I get check out that card though? I was going to say Rory Macdonald, Tyron Woodley, I can't wait. Craziness. Are you nuts? That fights craziness. Andre Alaska Brennan and John Tyron Woodley down 14 number of how big. It can get a lot shorter than uh, then. Then, um, who's like a big Demetrius Johnson. He's like a big Demetrius Johnson without Jujitsu Woodley. Woodley, strays. Wrestling's explosive. But he said one what sky Tyrone Woodley is getting better every fight and he's going to, he's definitely gonna mix it up with all the top guys. I know you don't make calls on this iron zinc, you have to put your money on one. One guy in that fight.

Speaker 1:          01:13:46       Right. On what? And Rory Macdonald, I would never put money on this. Saved if I, if I would not put money on a fight, would be totally private. I would never admit who I'd bet on, but I will tell you this possible scenarios of that fight with Rory Mcdonald is very skillful and he's very good at using angles and footwork and he's got a very educated jab and if you're not used to that jab you take, you take a couple of them in the face like Jake Ellenberger is and you go into a defensive shell cause you're like, okay, this guy is tuning me up with his jazz. You can do a whole night. Yeah. And every time I closed the distance, his jab is wicked, his footwork is wicked and moves very well. And if you get him on the ground is no god damn. Pick what is no goddamn picnic at Pickwick.

Speaker 1:          01:14:25       Pickwick. His, his guard is very good. It's very good offensively. Defensively he's got wicked butterfly guards. He keeps your hips elevated. He's fucking good man. Real good. The real question with that guy and that fight is can he get past that first storm? Cause Woodley's first dorm is a motherfucker. It's like a man versus a boy. It's like he's, he's so God damn, physically strong and fast and skilled. On top of that, you know he, he runs a weird race. That race of the, the cutting extreme cut of weight, extreme muscle density for 170 pounds. But somebody had a real good point about it on the underground though. They were like, yeah, that cost him, but would he be a better fighter if he didn't have that? That's the question you can't really answer because he's got very special abilities because of that build. He could have been a leaner guy if he chose to, if he chose to not lift weights.

Speaker 1:          01:15:12       If you chose to not eat as much. If he chose to do more cardio, he could probably get smaller. But would he be better as a fighter? That's an interesting because he presents a lot of unique problems because the fact that he's so God damn physically strong, 85 if you stayed at 85 to [inaudible] 70 [inaudible] 85 he's too small. He's too short. Well, I think that comes back to what I talked about with Tim Kennedy too, which is there should be more fucking weight classes, period. There should one f one seven eight one 85 his god damn crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:15:40       Oh, that's crazy. Crazy. I was, fuck we doing any more weight classes? I think it's fine. I mean you just got to find your spot and you can't until you too diluted until you're 235 pounds. Lavar Johnson's roid it up at two 65 again. You guys, you guys are crazy. Well, he's an animal.

Speaker 1:          01:16:04       No, I disagree with Mr Bravo.

Speaker 5:          01:16:07       I don't think we need to grow. I think we did a two 25 there's already a lot of, you have to like, we can barely keep up with the UFC now. Like you're going to add another way. That's for the APP. More chick weights before you add more guy or chick. Chick chick. Awesome. Are you kidding? I agree. I agree. It's fascinating watching women with good technique fight. When there's one Ronda Rousey, there's a cup. Just legit black belt. Right? Look, aside about Cyborg, Cyborg, Cyborg. Whoa, whoa. Rhonda. Hold about. We're talking about the UFC. I'm not talking of these bullshit amateurs. We're getting knocked out and boy tie events on freaking access TV nine I'm talking about, I'm talking about Seibel. She's not coming to the UFC and there's no one 45 category and you can't, she's going to 35, dude. She's going to have to Rhonda, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, you're good. You're good. No, she can come after Rhonda. You're going to have to pass a lot of steroid tests and no one's trying to see that bullshit. Well, I mean you're, I favor. Might as well get a Tan and jump in there and get a boob job. You know what I'm saying? What are we doing, Ron with a blue Ronda

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       versus Cyborg is going to be the biggest MMA fight and fucking history. Everyone's, everyone's going to want to watch it. Yeah. Every, every element that's going. Plus their grandmas and their aunts and their little girl cousins, they're all going to watch that one. Do you remember when, when, uh, Cyborg fod. Gina de that odd. The audience that the screen sound like a Beatles concert. Here's the pro whole different animal she was cycling versus Rhonda is going to be the biggest fight ever. Trust a Cyborg. He has some work to do. There's a bunch of problems is going to happen. She's been testing side one.

Speaker 4:          01:17:45       I just want to see the fight. That's the great. Rhonda is fucking everybody up. She needs some competition and Cyborg is very confident. She wants her. That makes a great store. She wants Mr upstairs. She wants, it's like playing grab ass in the minor league. Tell you us she wants to. That's the payday. If I'm a girl, of course. Of course. That's you think there's an issue. If a, if a woman is, let's say she was really taking male steroids, I don't know. She tested positive give accident. She says it was something very different. Very different. Very different ones to a man taking a testosterone supplement. When he takes his body has testosterone. A man's supposed to have testosterone. When a woman takes testosterone, there's physiological changes there that are first. Cyborg has male genitalia. No, it's irreversible. They get stronger, they get thicker. They get higher bone density to get wider.

Speaker 4:          01:18:41       Their face structure changes, their, their musculature changes. I know all that. I know that and I know just like Drago. Everybody knew Drago was on roids but they still wanted rocky for, you know what I mean? Like I had a script. Good point. You're saying it's bad for this or whatever. I think it's bad for the weekend and how are we going to pretend that like a large percentage of, I mean what are we supposed to do on the show? A large percentage of these fighters are on some ships. Don't you think there's a difference between a guy taking guy stuff in a girl taking guy stuff? You know what else taking male hormones. She's, she's changing her gender. You are probably correct. I'm not even thinking about that shit. I'm thinking about, I would love to see. I want to, I want to see Drago versus rocky.

Speaker 4:          01:19:23       I agreed on these. Rocky Drago is Cybil. I agree with you and I agree with shop. I agree with Shab as an athlete. I think Rhonda shouldn't have to deal with someone who may or may not have altered their body in a way that's irreversible and gives them an advantage. I'm obviously no doctor, so I don't know if that's the case, but what I've read is that there's, they've showed permanent results, like permanent changes to people who've done things like this. But if Cyborg can suck down 35 that'd be a very, very tough weight cut. Wait, God. Yeah, she's very, I mean, she's very big, so, so it might even the score and that. Now let me ask you something now of someone, a woman who, uh, it grows up doing vigorous exercise and gets into judo, judo to the point she goes to the Olympics while she's growing, does all that exercise do something to increase your testosterone? It's a very good question. I don't know. Does it? It's a very good question. I would say it's not artificial though. No, still. Yes, yes. I know what you're saying. And of course, Cyborg, suspicious sideboards, a monster. Cyborgs mark, very skilled for sure. No doubt. 100% no, she's very skilled. Black. I think she's a black man on the ground. Correct? Jujitsu Brown.

Speaker 4:          01:20:40       She's a monster. Hell of a fighter. I'm just saying there's certain things that need to happen as a fan, as a fan. Do you want to see that? I don't want to see it. Can I get some color on this? That's fine. Just not a fan of uh, sideboards. Once you fight other girls. It's hard for me to watch like when she fought Gina Brown Cyborg as a brown belt. No, I know. It just looks like two different levels in there. You know what I'm saying? It looks like almost like a strong ass girl versus a normal girl. Con. I don't like to see her just bullying him around. But Rhonda as strong as fuck I think is technique though. Strong road there plenty of times. Meat, chicken, strong. She's pretty strong for sure. But Sarah McMahon was more strong. Look what happened to her. Yeah. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 4:          01:21:23       Can I get some comps saying I want to satisfy cyborgs number father girl, who's stronger than Rhonda has. That's what I'm saying did, but she just joined. She destroys them with technique. I want to see it. That would be awesome. I think everyone, everybody wants to see that. Are you kidding? That's where I sat for me. I don't want to see it. I don't care for it. Yeah, we'll look. I see both of your points of view. I'm just wanting to see it. I want to see it as a fan. But I'd rather watch Meesha and Ronda fight nine times about that. If the doctors are correct, if the doctors, if the doctors are correct and anything that she did take, you know, it gives her a permanent advantages. How crazy would it be? A volunteer. That would be amazing. Right? It comes on real weird.

Speaker 4:          01:22:06       I think she beats her to cyber has a real weird discussion. I agree. But when, when you allowed to do that, like what are you allowed to do to your body? And I think, oh no, he caught him behind the ear. That was a big shot. This dude is, this is a gut dash. Yeah. These guys were revved up. Good. Hit. Go off. Yeah. Good half guard there. Um, it's an interesting conversation Eddie, cause I see your point of view as a fan and Brendan, I see what you're saying too. I mean, and I see both of them because as a fan, if it was on fuck for sure. Um, I would call that fight. I would hope there'd be a pay per view fight and I would get to call it because obviously you would, I'm, I'm just saying Cyborg fan me to listen.

Speaker 4:          01:22:48       I'm, I'm sure I'm gonna get some hate for this. There's no disrespect to Cyborg. However, I just don't like to see here bullied these little girls that Rhonda Rhonda problem. There's no problem. Did you see her kickboxing bout Dorina bars? Yes, I did. Great. She got knocked out. Well she got dropped. Mars is a bad bitch. You're well people, they like go cyborg glass and she fought a very, very high level striker in her world in kickboxing, Muay Thai, lost goods like a post nine, like, Hey, I'm just in here. Just get for sure. Yeah, she know. She knows sideboards a month. Just practicing. It was, it was great. I don't know, man. Look. It's interesting man. I would like to see it. It's interesting. It's very interesting. But you know the, the, there's a real discussion. How about what people should be able to get away with and not get away with far they take, what do you think about Gabby Garcia fight and I'm just fighting and MMA.

Speaker 4:          01:23:44       Gabby Garcia used to be a very heavy, she used to be a gigantic shoot yet to check six foot four 200 gigantic, 250 pounds. She's like a giant dude, like a six foot three, six foot four. He's giant. And she would cry. She would just enter absolute cause that was, no one ever goes to absolute and there's going to be an opposite and she just smashes everybody. I was watched, I ran into her Abu Dhabi and Beijing. I didn't, she, I don't think he speaks any English so we were like in the elevator together and match. It was like a giant mafioso hit man like right next to me going home and she just smashes everybody. But that was a Russian leg lock check on the other side about one 80 and she was leg lock in the shit out of everybody on the other side of the bracket and I go, Oh shit, this might, this might be trouble for Gabby who knocked this gap was just smothering everybody and they met I think in the finals or the semifinals. Gabby just fucked a steroid or Russian chick was sad. She was sitting on the side by herself, by herself. But Gabby, since then, she decided to get in the best shape of her. God Damn Luck. She's shot ready. She looks like frank shamrock.

Speaker 4:          01:25:01       She lost all that weight. She's actually working on a machine. That's a good question. What does Gabby Garcia fights way fighting in Japan? In Japan. They don't care. They don't bring a little chat box guys. Try not to talk over each other. My bad. Sorry. Both of you just, I agree, but it's super hard to listen to what people are complaining about. Cox. No, no, no, no. Let's call these fights. I slow down. Nothing wrong with calling shredded shot. That's her now. I wish you would, you would've found a picture of her fat before she tested positive for fertility drug. I Dunno what the fuck did that, but it's not of fertility. Drugs do that. Gimme Fabric Garcia test positive for fertility drugs stripped of her 2013 world's title one's Brazilian Jujitsu powerhouse. Gabby Garcia failed a drug test from the IB. J E F F 2013 worlds has been stripped of her metals, but it might not be what you think.

Speaker 4:          01:26:01       Hmm. Test Pause for being jack for a fertility drug. Wonder would a fertility drug would do for you dude drugs, I dunno man. For like dragon fertility or something. She doesn't have gargoyles. Can you imagine having a kid with her? I would like to impregnate her and see what happens is a, that is a, you know what I mean? Just as an experiment, I'll, I'll just, I'll pay some child support. But true. That's phenomenal. That is. Look at that bottom. Come on. Gabby is in tremendous. So she goes, she's going to fight pitches. God, so you're talking about Cyborg Cyborg turns 10 Brian's turned on. I'm a little turned off. I'm actually producing estrogen. Look at her body fucking bleaks. Theirs are better than mine. The greatest fight of all time. You're so hilarious. It's going to be Rhonda versus Rhonda. You haven't seen him lately. I'm sure there I haven't.

Speaker 4:          01:26:54       You ever seen me in that outfit, dude, so before you actually do me in that outfit and I'll, and see how I look compared to that. Wow. Come on. Jump into MMA. She's fighting on the same card is chrome. Gracie was. Is that what it is? That's incredible. Wow. That's amazing. That's nuts, man. You know what? My hats go off to her. Look at what great shape she's in. She's in phenomenal shape, right? I don't care. She's a chicken. She's not supposed to look like that. That's a lot of hard work right there. That's a serious diet and has a lot of hard training. Your yeah. Behind you. Like that's what she used to look like. That's, yeah. That's incredible. I'm looking at that. Yeah, but it's better. Larger. Come on. That's hard work right there. And fertility drugs apparently. I'd imagine there's some hormone will help involved in that, I would imagine. I'm not saying, Oh guys, look nice. Remember I told you that about that story if you got down. Yeah. If you got down to like what is her body? Her right there. Holy Shit. Put that over there. Oh my gosh. Recently she was coaching.

Speaker 4:          01:27:55       Morphing Vandelay big. She is families. Vandalism. The sauce. Rice. What is he six feet tall. Do you think Jack Bentley's biceps. Holy Shit. She's bigger up dude. Yeah, I got her while we haven't called this fight all over. People are gonna hate Marcio. E. X. A. N. D. R. E I would imagine. Zhan dre and uh, Warley. Elvis. Elvis, I think it's called. Yeah, Dude. It's Alexandra here. Like a l. E. X. Alexandra. No, no, no, no, no, no. Is it a oh well, they don't have it on those site. His head is in front of his fucking letter in his name. How stupid is that? Oh goodness. Oh God. It's so far that that's so John Gray, who's the dumb Alexandra? Who's the fucking most don't know what it says. Who's the mommy that does that? That's so stupid. I never did that. And a w the UFC site. That's so dumb. Texts Dana, he'll get right to it and then cover 90 seconds. How could you cover a guy name with it? Right? What did you run out of space? You file. This has been taken it to this

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       guy and I'm sure the guy who designs our website, a very nice guy you don't want to fear is he just fucked up. He has been taking it to got the underhook and half wash. He goes to full guash. They're saying they're saying chill out. There's a freaking superstar now. They love him. Isn't that hilarious? Yeah. They love him. They love him in Brazil. After all the shit he talked about Anderson and all the shit that the people are so mad they wanted to fuck him up from Brazil did. He doesn't know. And the scenes that I saw from that, I've only seen a couple of times. He looks like really like he's not nonconfrontational. He's that Vander Vandelay get mad so bad. She also, and as Jack Armstrong, all American, they do on the show. He was the hook and he started a fight with him.

Speaker 2:          01:29:47       He just looked like an asshole, a chill set. Every time he'd walk into any room Vandelay it'd be there with a mouth piece and trying to fight him and chill. It's like bro, listen behind scenes. He's like, dude, I'm not going to fight you every time. This is stressful, man. This is for the show. We're doing this forest show. We're going to fight. You don't have to do this every time. Vandelay [inaudible] was not having it. So I was on UFC tonight, last Wednesday and chill. We were sitting there and you just got the text that he's fighting a chill vittores sorry. Fighting that tail said it exactly how everyone was thinking. He goes, well one guy, you're kind of like, I can beat him. They knew when changes. You're like, ah shit. Yeah. Cause I mean beat doorman. You're talking to a different game now. South Pole.

Speaker 2:          01:30:33       No, I mean like tricky ass, ridiculous striking. I said anyways, let's be as honest as possible. Hard as fuck to take desk to be honest as possible here post TRT. How is that possible? How is it guy go from what Vito was doing? UFC, the way he looked, how dominant he was. Three fights in a row knocks how Bisbing knocks out Luke Rockhold with a wheel kick to the head, knocks out Henderson in the first round saying, looks like a destroyer on TRT the entire time. What do you chalk that up to us at his age? Question, but, well, here's the big question. How do you get off of that stuff and then get your testosterone to a level where you can fight? Well, when you have a, uh, TRT exemption [inaudible] I think maybe they can be on TRT 24, seven and they don't have to worry about shit that got the exemption.

Speaker 2:          01:31:29       But now that they're being stricter, no, you don't understand. There's no exemptions. No, there was a lot. There's, they're done. There's no, no, I know, I know. No, no, no. I know. I know. No, no, no. They're done. Now that they're done, does it make the guys go back to the old school way and just say, okay, we've got a cycle and it's going to be all black? Yeah, it's cause we already know about the stricter rules and steroids and then get Vanair lays on him. He just got hot blue. We don't know. No, he didn't get popped. He just refused to take his test. We don't know. He, they came to office or Dick

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       came to his gym and they said, you know, they, they need a random drug test from him. And he was like, you don't have any identification. Who are you? I don't, I need to get my lawyer to look at this. And he said that he always submits his drug results and submits his blood tests at the proper time. If you've got to give the guys fair day in court, I know what you're saying for that. Now you can, that's not a good exam. Weirdo could show up and pretend that he's some fucking UFC representative or a Nevada state athletic commission representative with no id or no, uh, you know, no credential example. But, uh, nonetheless, uh, does that, do MMA fighters? Do UFC fighters get tested more often than football players do that? Yes, we can test it without questioning. Let's get tested usually once a year unless you fail it and then you get put into a program or you're randomly tested throughout the season a few months before.

Speaker 1:          01:32:53       I can help you out with this. It's real simple. Combat Sport athletes in general get tested more than any other sport. UFC fighters get tested more than any other combat athletes. It was just until recently that they started testing drugs, a drug testing boxers and it was a lot of it is Floyd Mayweather sand a lot of shit about guys like um, pack Yao. So he submitted to these random, you know, uh, Olympic style drug tests, random. They show up at your house at any time. They take blood tests from him. He submitted to those and he sorta changing boxing because of that. And he kept saying while he's doing it with cleaning it up, boxing still a lot of guys who were like kind of perturbed about Manny Pacquiao. That was the big rumors at patio. Yeah, he's destroying everybody. But look what happened. I keep, the guy's gone through eight God damn weight classes and everybody's saying that he's on steroids.

Speaker 1:          01:33:39       I don't know if he's on steroids, but I know that Floyd Mayweather believed he's on steroids and a lot of other people believed he's on steroids. So they just started testing people on like super regular basis. Can they test you shit like this, but I'm sorry. Shit like this where they did with what? They caught a Alistair Overeem, random drug tests where they wanted to do this to, to uh, Vandelay random drug tests. They did it to veto random drug test and Vito was on testosterone and that was the reason why testosterone got banned in the first place. The whole thing went down when they tested pause, when Vito tested positive, the Vata State Athletic Commission. After that. Before that they were considering him for a testosterone exemption and there was a lot of talk whether or not he would be up for a testosterone exemption. But because when they tested him, he tested positive.

Speaker 1:          01:34:24       They scrapped the whole testosterone program with v toward stuff. Man, cause you talk to him. I'm gone. This tour. He was hurting dudes, man. Oh Yang's eyes. Can you, can you test for human growth hormone? Yes you can. Yes you can. But I don't think they're doing that only through blood and it has to be like you'd have to inject in, they have to test like right away. Elvis tagged him with a right and then got off the ground. He's got an arm and gay teens. That's it. It's over. It's done. He's going up. He's out. Al called Eddie. What do you think about this? Um, about a lot of guys don't even go up high on the neck. Like he didn't go high on the neck there. He just pulled back like a regular gates. Him. It's okay if you've got a deep grip.

Speaker 1:          01:35:06       No, no, no. Deep grip is one kind of gear. Teen Shallow Grip. That's another kind of getting, that's more of a net crank, shallow grave. But what he did right there where he leaned back, I see that again. Well, he leaned back. They'll show it in the, in the replay. We just straight back, right? Yeah. He leans back there. Slept money. Statistically when you got an arm in, usually the right technique is to go up high on the neck and put weight on the neck and crushing and crushed the victim. It's more of an angle angle and bend them doing leg curls. Smash. He just pulled back like a regular duty. But obviously he puts you to sleep. Let's see here. Let's see. It was crazy. Yeah, so Alvez tagging right hand. Oh, welcome to Queer Street on population. You all right. So here, look how he's doing this.

Speaker 1:          01:35:55       He's got it. And look, that's a good regular, he's doing like bending. He's betting the, yeah, it's just a regular arm and getting done, right? Yeah, a little bit of that side of himself. He's doing leg curls. He's not pulling, he's actually bending down and don't watch like was right and then bending that thing and it's a perfect good. What he's doing with an angle is what you would do if you were head on by going up high in the neck. So it all depends on what his grip was doing to some people like to go ball and socket some like the Pretzel Grip and all. Depends what he's doing underneath. Yeah. Isn't that interesting how some guys just have that fucking guilty and like when you saw um, Joseph Benevidez get that mounted guillotine on Tim Elliot has like, there's some dudes if they just get that arm in there and it doesn't matter what happens next or one way or another, they're going to find a way to finish that bitch off that looks like Dunkin.

Speaker 1:          01:36:50       I dug it out of the fucking mountains. That is Dunkin. When Harley talk, if you could have a Harley, if he lives in North Carolina, if he went back to Asheville, where he's from, dude, you ever been the most more beautiful place in Asheville, North Carolina? You ever been there? No Dude, we did a Raleigh and then we did raw, were always beautiful. But after we did Raleigh, but we're take a drive into the mountains to Asheville. It's like a utopian community in the middle of the North Carolina mountains. It's still crazy shit of all time. I have a friend who lives up there and he's telling me how amazing it was, but I couldn't, I couldn't believe it until I got there. Beautiful place. Super Intelligent people. It's a college town walking the streets, people just friendly restaurants, bars, low population, Asheville, North Carolina from north girl population. This is how crazy the town is. There's, there's so many trippers in that town that the farmers started putting antifungal properties and the cows food to make sure that they didn't grow mushrooms on them because it's all rainy up there and like silicide mushrooms naturally grow on cow patties out there. So these kids are all tweaked on mushrooms like all the time.

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       So much so Caroline. So much so that farmers started spending their own fucking money to make sure that they didn't have psychedelic mushrooms growing on their cow. Shit. You know how many, how many times that I call the paramedics to get these kids passed out in their borrowings house like passed out. I climb, I climb, I climb big whiskey mountain on mushrooms in Wyoming. I was hugging a rock. I had a long conversation with a rock. My buddy turns around and look at me, we're hot. It is the true story. He turns around and look and he, I have no clothes on, just my sneakers and he goes, where are your clothes? I go, I don't know. We couldn't find my clothes. I came back down. I had asked Patty about this. I had a blue mouth for many blueberries and I was completely naked. We never found my Elvis is a bad motherfucker. Man attacked.

Speaker 2:          01:38:43       Yeah, he's, he's super bummed out. Kids got some traps on them. It's so different for you, isn't it? You know, and the difference between a guy like these random dudes talk shit on the Internet, you know, and the impact that has on a guy like you who puts his whole fucking life on the line. What does that feel like when you, like when you lose a fight and then you go on Twitter and see it? Just a bunch of people fucking with you, man. It's not too bad anymore. And I think from doing the podcast stuff like that, people get a sense of my personality and these things. I was just like this Dick, like cocky Dick, you know? But, but doing podcasts and doing more interviews and getting out there, I get to show a little bit of personality. But marijuana when I lost to, uh, I think, uh, Rothwell one time when I've lost a Rothwell my Twitter was so negative, it was insane.

Speaker 2:          01:39:29       And then before I was gonna Fight Lavard Johnson, huge fight in my career. Right. You lose that one. You know, who knows what happened to tour playing grab ass can $500. So, um, you know, before that one I stayed off social media. I'd make a post by went reading anything they post, don't read anything good. And then, uh, even even before the [inaudible], it started to get a little bad. The week of the fight.

Let's be honest, Danny. I find Danny, he looks more like a big Denny. He has a Greek look like you could be a Greek statue, but there are other pictures where he looks a lot more like Aaron. No, he doesn't look like Eric. I'm sorry. Sorry. I, you know what I get? Oh No, no, he does. Eddie. That's just a bad image. Just go images on Denny. Come on. Come on dude. I rolled with him in San Francisco, uh, like a month ago. I told him to stay away from big guys. You know he was dope man. Now he was dope. No, you so much fun to roll. Yeah, no, he's awesome. All right. I, we'll go back to Aaron Hernandez and he does the 10th planet in San Francisco Right before he runs. Yeah, he came down to empowers with that. Tarek, let's get some pictures of a, Oh, hey, there he is. [inaudible] you guys could definitely be related. How crazy this dude is in the NFL and shot allegedly three people. Three people is 24. He's 24. He shot two people. James Gang related shit. What?

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       He's in the pros and he's an, again, the best tight ends on the Patriots on the one that SBC bats. He signed a 42 wait a minute. $42 million deal. Did he grow up in La Right now? Connecticut, Connecticut. There's a Mexican gangs and Connecticut reportedly having Oh nuts. Not Mexicans. Puerto Rican having a tough time paying his defense team. They don't give a fuck. That's sucking you dry cow. They don't care. They don't give a fuck. How much money does he have? You know I heard he has a big old hug by the way. A big old hog. Dang. What are you thinking though? Don't you wish you could talk to like your 24 millions in the bank? I mean, pride was going to be one of the best times ever in the NFL. If freak man, freak out. Look at this. Look at this. Ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          01:44:38       It got busted selling weed. He was running back for the Cleveland browns. Look at that. A portion of his 12 point $5 million bonus was supposed to be guaranteed to Hernandez when he signed a contract extension in 2012 is in dispute son, and it's one point $3 million home is a subject of a restraining order there. Present prevents him from selling it or using it for anything other than paying a future judgment in a civil lawsuit filed by the family of one of the men that he's accused of killing. This dude is accused of killing three fucking peep. POW bullets. Just how did it go down? Is that a cloud or no, no. The one he just got indicted on is he pulled up there saying he pulled up in a SUV, just shot up the SUV, killed two dudes. And this is before he shot this other dude. They only found out that he did it after he got busted for killing this other dude. And they're saying he killed the other dude. Cause that dude knew stuff about another murder he did. And so then all these other witnesses that you got, well you kill one person. He's like, well, you know something that's a to more people. You're a murderer. Good football player, handsome dude. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:45:46       are handsome dude and he's only 24 that's what's crazy. You know, when you take a dude who's a big super athlete and he's living in some sort of a bad situation and he's just fucking, just a huge, just aggressive savage dude and that's why he's so God damn good at football. And then you expect them to keep his shit together because he got an NFL contract. There's $25 million know you're from the hood and you bring all your entourage with you that's going to work out gray. Oh Geez. No, we're here on the phone, the bottom now, the whole team. And they just, they also want to prove that they're still a jet. You know, they're always trying to prove like they're still tough. Like, Oh, I'm not out the hood. There's still hood. Maybe he wanted out trying to get out, but he had done so much shit that there was still some unknowns, but he probably didn't want to do it. You know what? I'm blowing up now. I got to fucking kill this dude. He's going to fucking ruin all guys got killed him to save his career. That's what you say. I believe him. I

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       don't know why, but I do, but I don't know why, but I do believe I've got a feeling Aaron got soft dog, soft change Sun people tell me that you've changed. Oh Shit, I've changed. Yeah. Yeah. Hell yeah. I've changed it. Oh, since 10th grade. Oh really? Yeah. I've changed. I'm rich as shit and I fight in UFC. I've changed 100% and I'm like, Shit, I'm not doing all right. I like that old brand here that DOL can outside. Do you have seen some shit possible sponsors? You don't understand how much the heavyweight makes? You know what I want? Apollo was complaining about that recently, although he was complaining about [inaudible] pay. The difference in pay between the heavyweights and the lighter well have people, I mean heavyweights run when you get like 55 will show what's up.

Speaker 4:          01:47:45       This is not my new contracts. Will is the last, the oldest one I was on the ultimate fighter Mirko Cro cop for 10 and 10 like this. Okay, so you didn't make that much money before, but now you're many. We got here by spots, got here and he's helicopter. That's all he metafarm they got here on a, on a wings of a peg. Horseback can't as his actual numbers. So on the podcast I refuse, I refuse to allow it because you're asking him a question that he might not want to answer and you saying it live and if you do that, like, you know, you're not giving them a chance to say like, I don't like, I don't like to talk about that shit. How much does UFC pay you? Exactly. That's what I'm saying. Damn your quick as fuck. That was a serious question. Look at Gilbert Melendez doing a little, uh, Gilbert's doing good.

Speaker 4:          01:48:32       Awesome. I love that comment. Tim Kenny's. Here's all jacked up. Give him a Gnocchi before he got on there. He did a great job on my fight. He's in the 1950. [inaudible] grapple can eat by the way, is a close here. Do a great job at minimum wage. Gay. Where's Karen? Where's the boy club? And Glover did good too. Although he did fuck up a few told hold. He could use a couple of, what do you mean? Well, I just mean like you could use it like pause, like pause, hold, talk too much. No, no. He can eat. He needs a couple more reps. It dude commentate. It's tough. It's super tough. Everyone thinks they can compensate because they could talk shit while they watched the UFC. You know when they're drunk and they're comfortable when the camera's in front of you. Sanely tough. Can you be yourself when the pressure's on?

Speaker 4:          01:49:16       Shit, anybody can catch up. God Damn football high school wide receivers have great hands. But the difference between a high school football player and a pro football flat player, can you hold on to that bar when there's pressure? That's the difference. Do it under pressure. What? The other thing I can't might've heard them a little bit is he's an ex Kenny Florian who does it for? Yes, Kenny was cool and there was a, there was a couple things that Jeff had wrong. He thought it was setting him up for a triangle the whole time, like in the beginning and never thinking about a triangle. So he kind of fucked up there. But overall I thought Jeff did a great job for his first show every doing color. Damn. You gotta just didn't get to bring in your game. Totally. Yeah, and he was on his own moves.

Speaker 4:          01:49:55       He was honest. When I wrote for the vaporizer, he says, I like to consider myself an expert in Jujitsu and I'm confused right now. Kenny. He said that he goes, what is going on here? It's crazy. People were doing tutorials of the vaporizer the next day, the next week wrong. They had no idea what they were doing. They thought you were talking about and then the move at the very end, I don't know. I'm not, I'm not qualified, but I have to say you were doing stuff and Joe is screaming cause he, he saw you were getting positioned but I have no idea that you had position before you did it. And it was, Joe knew what I was doing the whole time. I knew I was going bananas. As soon as Eddie Bravo gets a lock down, everybody got crazy crazy when you went from quarter guard locked. That is crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:50:35       And I got crazy when the Hoya got the under hook, people wouldn't, all the Gracies called Ya cause for six minutes he was fighting for the underdog. He finally gets it and they fucking make noise for the under hook. Yeah. But he didn't have, he didn't have, by the way, for the record and from my vantage point, he never even was in the, in the game with you. But I'll do over due respect of course toilet. But, but um, did you get, did you get acknowledged for that from the Gracie camper or how did that work? You didn't pay attention?

Speaker 1:          01:51:04       I'll, I'll answer it because it's difficult for him to answer. Yeah. It was embarrassing. There was there their portrayal of the actual events where it was embarrassing. It's like a cover up government cover up, embarrassed for them for all of them. That and not one of them did an accurate assessment of it post fight until they experience criticism. Okay. When the experience criticism then people started giving him credit for being loyal for, no, no, no, no, no. They were being ridiculous and biased and it was sad as a someone who's a huge fan of the Gracies and a huge fan of Jujitsu and um, in massively in debt, my own personal life for what their family's accomplished, I'm in debt to all the Gracies Elio, Gracie without a doubt, his, his accomplishments and his, his art changed my life because it changed Eddie's life. Eddie's life changed my life.

Speaker 1:          01:51:55       John Jacques Machado, his life who changed Eddie's life. I mean, all of us are directly chained back to Elios work that said, their, their depiction of that fight was an embarrassment. It was an embarrassment to the greatest martial arts family of all time. Like they weren't accurate in their assessment of what happened. What happened was horrible or didn't know what to do with at his game. He got wrapped up, he got, he got swept on multiple occasions and he got threatened twice and he got his knee fucked up. His knee popped in a crazy position. Most people on the planet would attempt to that. Most people boiler decided not to tap to it and they also agreed to ridiculous rules or they never, they never addressed the fact that the only reason why he's able to survive was he was allowed to grab Eddie's clothes, but Eddie wasn't allowed to grab his clothes.

Speaker 1:          01:52:39       It was, there were the most ridiculous rules. Those rules were an embarrassment. I was embarrassed by those because you tried to change it. They threatened you. They were like, no, no, no. You have to wear the pants if you don't wear the pants were pulling out. He the, the deal was Eddie wears the pants and he can grab addies pants, but Eddie crank grab his shorts. It's ridiculous. That doesn't make any sense that someone who's fighting scared. So Eddie agreed to that. Anyway, goes in there, still dominates a fight in the one thing that's saved toilers I mean, coilers leg was in a terrible position, but it wasn't in the worst position. The worst position is one step later. And if Eddie, if that guy wasn't able to grab Eddie's clothes and he wasn't able to hold on for dear life on Eddie's the collar of his pants, Eddie would have switched and if he switched to putting his foot on his other foot, if you went to that, that the dark position.

Speaker 1:          01:53:31       After that, there's the vaporizer and then there's that one step where you take the vaporizer. Did def con 10 it's ugly. You're leg is getting ripped apart, your legs getting ripped apart. He's, and I saw three I was like, that need is, that doesn't look natural, but that's only seven out of 10 bro. That's seven out of 10 that the next three steps are the ugliest shit you've ever seen in your life and you see guys scream in agony. God, that's horrible guy. I hate that. But they didn't address any of that. When they put it on their Instagram, their Instagram was all about how great heuler looked and all about heuler getting through to submission attempts and smiling like, what are you talking about? How about it? At the end of that Gracie, the end of it, Gracie in all caps and exclamation points.

Speaker 1:          01:54:15       Preposterous. Right? So I was embarrassed by it because I think that we all have an obligation to be as honest and as open as possible. When we're assessing our friends, our loved ones, our brothers and sisters performances, there's a, and there's, there's this weird thing that people do when they start getting biased and they start disregarding the accomplishments of others. If the fight was completely reversed, I would absolutely say men boiler Gracie dominated. Eddie Bravo was crazy. He just, he just knew how to sweep them. He got them into bad positions. He fucked up Eddie's leg. Me. Very brave of Eddie that he didn't tap. But man, I was super impressed with Euler. Hey, I don't know if they're going to do it again. Maybe Eddie would like to reconsider. Knowing that Oilers game is so tricky. If they were totally opposite, but there weren't opposite.

Speaker 1:          01:55:00       So when I look at it, I have to look at it. Yeah, I'm on my biased. Absolutely. You know, I, I look, I love the Gracies but Eddie's one of my best friends on the planet. You know, you're, you're probably top two human beings that I love more. I love you buddy. But a fairly decent, my two friends that need to put in a disclaimer, like I just gotta tell you now, it's all, these are my two best friends of all times, so I'm, I'm sure I'm biased, but even being biased objectively looking at it, I get sad because I think that what they did was an embarrassment. That's what I think I want to know is where the fuck are the pickles, bro. I know. I think we ate them all. We've got to call up Grillo's pickle. I personally love the, I love how you started that. I think it was great for one hand goes on the mat, you slap the mat and the other hand goes up and you start waving.

Speaker 4:          01:55:45       That was a wrestling and I never wrestle and I thought, I thought for sure he's going to think I'm going to pull guard, but let me give a wrestling look for a second to freak them out and then I'll, I didn't even know you were doing it was so great. Bam out there. It's hard. It's hard when people get emotionally attached to results. It's hard when people get emotionally attached to fight, you know you've made a great case. You just need does that, this guy every fight. Of course. It's a great, a great assessment. Well that's what it is. You know what I mean? Even you know and that that head who I love, you know his, his take on it was that you didn't pass the boiler Elio challenge or the Elio test filter that your, your, your style would be ineffective in a street fight, which is, it's, it's unfortunately ignorant because if they knew that if punches were involved, your style works better, your style's more effective when the is trying to punch because if a guy on top was trying to punch, he's given up under hooks.

Speaker 4:          01:56:45       He's given up over hooks, giving up a lot of shit when you start throwing your arms around. And the only reason I'm in court, a guard is because there's not punching exactly that was punching. I would get in deeper right away because that, since you could use your hands on top 100% for to keep me away and rape, choke me and do all this stuff that people do, but it's because you're not punching. Have you ever fought MMA? Never. What'd you ever met will not tell them when you're telling a story about how they were trying to set you up. Tell that story because that's a crazy story I've told. I've told that story before. You don't even have to say the name of the organization. You don't have to say the name of the organization.

Speaker 4:          01:57:22       I'll say I'll set it up so you don't have to know the name of the fighter or the organization. Uh, a prominent Japanese organization that may or may not still be in business came up general in Los Angeles and they wanted to talk to him about having a, a, an MMA. There's no, there's no, uh, there's no blind in there. Is there some, you guys liked that wine though? They wanted to talk to him about having a UFC fight and they told us no, no, no, it wasn't MMA grappling match. They go, no, no, no, no, no, no. But there was the, oh, that's the [inaudible] was a grappling match. That's the only reason I sat down and talked to them because I wasn't trying to do MMA, but they go, oh, we want to get you to find a, uh, a super fight, grappling match. We're going to mix it in to our MMA show.

Speaker 4:          01:58:07       And I met them at the Beverly Wilshire radice hotel and La. I met him there and the in the lobby and a representative of this organization. And I said, okay, I'll do it, you know, and they go, well, how about if we, uh, we made it a MMA fighter. So I said, well, I don't do it. Then they know it will, but we'll make it so that you win. And then the guy who brought me there, I looked over at the guy who brought me, looked it all up. I looked at him and I said, what the fuck is going on here? What do you mean? What? What do you say that? What can

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       you possibly say that? What did we make it so they can? There's a lot of setting on you there that sounds like they're setting up. They're setting you up to go there. You're going to win and then you get in there and they got beats the fuck out of here. I would've never, I would've never done your dishonorable anyway. Why should they do that for you? This is Jap. Japanese culture is very different than American culture. If they set you up and you go over there, you ain't suing. You're not saying, hey, we had an agreement to a fixed fight going to be in Japan. This was the Yakuza. I'm excited for this fight. Yeah, heavyweights. Tough finale. Heavyweights. Vito or Miranda and a Antonio. Carlos junior is his nickname. Antonio only house. Oh, Antonio only has four or five. Very similar to me with only four fights on the ultimate fighter finale.

Speaker 2:          01:59:25       Interesting. Next, Luther is his nickname. That's us. That's what happened in [inaudible] name is Brandon shop. Cut them some slack. I forget man. It's hard to keep up. I lost the finale to Roy Nelson, but I only had four fights of Roy Head, whatever, 25 former world champ. But the thing that helped me, and I've never told you this show, the thing that helped me, um, I was in a dark place after. I've never lost any right. A fight. I lost that fight and I watched the replay back and uh, during my walked out, uh, Joe on the broadcast goes, listen, Brendan has a very tall order. Roy Nelson is a hell of a fighter. He could jump in division right now and beat anyone. Brendan will has four fights no matter what happens in this fight. Brendan is going to go on and have a great career. And honestly, man, that helped me out so much.

Speaker 2:          02:00:09       That's awesome dude. I'm so glad that help. That was totally true. You know there's a thing about those, those ultimate fighters, situations like that where you get a guy who's gotten mad, mad fucking fights behind him and Roy Roy was fuck, he was real good and wasn't known for. It was weird. The show made him known for being a knockout puncher. Yeah, but before that he fought. He fought Andre or loss you. He came in the house got robbed. You fight. That was when they were doing that bullshit. That elite Xc, they would stand you up. You'd be like in the ground for 15 minutes. He was inside control working on a Kamora locked the, Yup. Double wrist lock. However, either way you paint it Orlowski Tko Odom. He did the only guy to ever do it. But I think that he was like more uncomfortable about taking shots back down to different writing.

Speaker 2:          02:00:58       But it's interesting when you think about that, the fact that he got [inaudible] and since then he's been invulnerable to shots. I agree. But look at Verdugo for doom. Hit Him with everything. But the goddamn kitchen sink. Not really a heavy hitter though, is he need the fucking shit out of his face. It's true. You know, and he's taking bombs from you name. It took bombs from Cro. Cop. He took bombs from everybody and Chubb. Julie, how about for landed some career don't Santos Sto Santos. I tell you what. They just announced Roy. Mark Hunt. Yeah. Back to back to the ultimate fighter finale. There's a lot of fights like most most uh, commissions went st you in that fight, right? Guy With four and the guy was third right here. Going back a way. Good. Exactly. But because it's the show, I didn't know it hasn't been part of a cautions.

Speaker 2:          02:01:41       Took those things into account. I really dare you do fight ever. If you don't know that I'm learning, man. I, this is my, this is my education. Oh, don't do it. Nice mix in boxing. If a guy has an extensive amateur background, if a guy's like world champion, amateur boxer and you know, he's fighting in Cuban, then all sudden needs in America. And they, one of the challenge for the title of his third fight, that's not unheard. That Cuban program is amazing. Well brushing as well. There's a Russian guy recently challenged for a title and you'd only been boxing professionally for very short period of time. Well, I went from fighting Billy McGee and Denver. You know, where he was scared and you know, I could tell I was beating the more ready at the weigh ins to fight and Roy Nelson in Las Vegas. I was like, what?

Speaker 2:          02:02:25       The vine fire baptism by fire did you just got to deceptives knew about him when you went in there? I mean, I thought 100% I was getting knocked him out in the first round. I was very, I was very naive. Roy has got deceptive time. I wouldn't change it for anything. No Man. What? He dropped that bomb on Nogueira. That was one of the saddest knockouts of all time stiff. Dude. That was scary. Sick, sick fight, but ruin Roy knocked out Nogueira it was a career ender. It was like, whoa. That was a sign that the fucking wheels have come off the wagon. This is over. That was reassured that she had thought he killed. Just measure it, wrote it and money killed. When he hit Congo. I was like, oh no. Oh my God, you killed Congo. You know what's crazy? He didn't even start.

Speaker 2:          02:03:07       You Killed Kenny. Oh my God. You Killed Congo. He didn't even start striking until 2009 yeah. Roids a special special. That's crazy animal. You know he hit me. He didn't. People think hit me in the jawline. Oh, show up. You got a weak ass John Grant. These 265 pounds, shit happens. We in the face. It's weird. Your brain shuts off. However, he hit me behind the air directly behind the outage, right behind the air. He threw a double jab. I slipped the first one and my head was out of position. Right hand, right plan. The year before that though, I was putting on a clinic fight me now what's up, son? Don't have four fights anymore. What's up? You want it to archive? You know, I don't care. I don't that I'd rather fight, uh, other people. But if it were to happen, yeah, it'd be a totally different story.

Speaker 2:          02:03:49       You know, Eddie, what we were saying about, um, how the Gracies were saying what you did didn't pass the Elio filter. What was fucked up about that was what we were talking about earlier about when here on fought Andre Galvao and he had that match with Andre Galvao and just, he was showing his defense. He let him pass his guard and let them mount him. He led them out. You gotta yell or respect that. That's some gangster shit out. Look that criticism though. The criticism. I'll be honest, the OPS team, right? Henna and heat on her, like my brother's band, but I haven't seen any of this stuff. I watched the match. I don't see any of that stuff. They've done nothing. I know that. I know they like you. I have [inaudible] me about you. I don't matter. You know what? I don't see any of it. So I that's why people that go shops, we didn't quite cause he's teamed Gracie. No, I'm not on it. I

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       don't know. I haven't seen any of that. I watched metamorris. I was like, damn, that was dope for Jujitsu. It was the most talked about Jujitsu match since Brenden's shop Cyborg, not

Speaker 5:          02:04:46       [inaudible]. It was

Speaker 1:          02:04:56       very talked about. And you know, I'm just not that I'm anti Metamorris, I'm a hundred percent pro. I'll promote that show to the day it stops. He's just fucking Christ. I love that. He can't go five minutes without talking freaks out. I love that they're doing it. I love that they're doing it. But I think you gotta be, you gotta be really careful with your assessments of a situation if the UFC did that, save the UFC, talked about Tj Dillashaw and Hanan Barao and painted it all about Hanan Barao being tough and amazing how he got through that fight and it was incredible. Oh, you're saying after the fact they did, it was a little bit of that before a fight. Well, that was before the fight. No one thought that was going to happen the way. I mean, I guess maybe Tj did, but I didn't think, I don't know Tj, but thought it was gonna be a really tough fight.

Speaker 1:          02:05:45       I thought Tj has chances to win because he's got great endurance. If you could take it into third, fourth and fifth round and push a tremendous matchups when you get in the top 10 it's about matching. Number nine can be a horror metric, number one. But anyway, if the UFC painted it in an incredibly inaccurate way, so imagine after the fact [inaudible] professional or unprofessional. That's what it felt. If they, if they talked about the Tj Dillashaw Hanan Barao fi and obviously that is a more dominant example because Tj just lit hand and brow on fires, even a fight. It was reduced. It was amazing. It was the best performance of ever seen. It's I agree and biggest upset because everyone's like Matt Serra GSP cause this was five rounds of a straight ass whooping clinic son. There was nothing wound clinic and then stops him in the fifth with a fucking head kick.

Speaker 1:          02:06:30       I mean the shit was off the charts. Ass Kid was off the charts. But what Eddie did, toiler was Hoyle. Lou was never once in a dominant position, never once in a position where he was threatening Eddie and Eddie without a doubt, fucked his leg up. So for them to paint this inaccurate picture of it, and then in their credit corrected it. Once they experience criticism and actually took the original post down from Instagram, they deleted it from Instagram, which is essentially admitting that you fucked up. Right, right. I mean, that's what it is. It did. Heuler did you talk to another after the fight at the post fight? Uh, conference, right? We have a cool look. It's there. Cool. Right afterwards. They were cool before it. Sure. Here's the deal, man. This is the Internet. This is a different world. You can't get by just on your name anymore.

Speaker 1:          02:07:15       You gotta be cool across the board. You don't get any free passes. You didn't win the lottery. Everything is what it is. And every, and if you pretend it's not what it is, and everybody can see that they think you're a con. That's just, that's just how it goes today. It's a different world. And you know, I appreciate what [inaudible] Lt. Wow. His beautiful mountain. This fucking dude, this kid is in a ps four. No two. I'll tell you right now, both of these guys, well they're both can have a career in the UFC. Whoever wins or loses obviously. However, neither Wilms find that heavyweight, I think one way to at two 14 one way to get to 12 or something like that. Two 30 and two 18 Miranda on the bottoms to 30. And that's apparent. That's on his bio in the UFC. That might not be accurate.

Speaker 1:          02:07:52       You might, uh, he might be preparing for two oh five after this. Eddie, is there a guy, a Jujitsu guy just to guy that you would really like to fight, that you're, that that is a huge challenge to you that we can kind of get that fucking card pass sick. Ooh, he was trying to get back. He was trying to get back to, um, he was trying to hip escape and the dude pass his garden got into side control like a wizard. But look at this. Yeah, man. Antonio, Carlos junior is a bad motherfucker. No, you know what I think, um, I mean I think that match was super important. I was thinking of shooting poor. Important for you. I think it was super important for Jujitsu and I think that it showed that Jujitsu matches can be super fucking exciting and I think it opens up the door to a possible future in having some sort of a professional, oh, but Ooh, that's attacking the, he's attacking.

Speaker 6:          02:08:48       Would you change anything? Would you change the rules of metamorris though as in is something they can do to make it, I dunno. Well, submission only submission only for sure. But since Metamorris isn't a tournament matches, they should, they should. They should. It should be more a winner take all or serious difference between show money and submission money. Like it should be, uh, 1000 bucks to show for you. No, right. Or 7,000. If you sell it, it's gotta be right. Go for this. And you have to, you have to, it's gotta be like that. If you're going to have single matches the money, we'll create the urgency that creates the cause, a entertained. Otherwise you get, otherwise you get this weird kind of stalemate. 20 minutes, man, you've got to make it worth it. That's what we're trying to do in my, my tournament is all about fixing the, the boringness of Jujitsu. That's what I'm trying to do. I'm not trying to make money putting together this tournament. Money is not a goal at all. I'm not, I'm losing money on my first tournament. We're just trying to put together Jujitsu for TV. Can we? It should be on TV already, but it's not on teams triangle.

Speaker 6:          02:10:03       Oh, so close. Beautiful Pass. He's he, he's San Antonio kid is nasty man. I like, he hesitated on that cinch, man. He had that triangle there for fucking obese

Speaker 1:          02:10:13       too, man. Look, but look at Antonio's back to his half guard. Sneaking up the back door on them. Is there a guy you'd like to do this crazy. They're stopping him from throwing those elbows. That is so ridiculous. They stopped the thigh. Why? Because they're illegal. The 12 to six elbows and legal on your thought. Why? It's so stupid because it's a rule that was at 12 to six elbows are illegal anywhere. It was created when they were worried about people killing people and way back in the day in the back of the head, no, no, no, no. He's hitting the five. No it was from I, I've explained it a million times and you've never paid attention once cause you not a real MMA fan. So I'll do it one last time on, there are other people that aren't big. John McCarthy was first talking to the athletic commissions trying to get the UFC legal.

Speaker 1:          02:10:57       They wouldn't let the downward elbow in because they saw those karate demonstrations at two o'clock in the morning. We're dudes would break bricks with, they're not bullshit. So stupid. It's amazing the dumbest shit ever. And it proves that you're not a real MMA fan cause you don't know that. So now, now that we've established that, don't ever say a guy can hit a guy with a right hand. Again man, the club, I want to be in a club. And who do you want? Who is there? A guy out there, a Jujitsu guy that you would love to fight, who you think would be a huge challenge to you,

Speaker 4:          02:11:27       whoever would generate the biggest pay day. Wait, hold on. Okay, so let me give it, let me tell you, I don't hate anybody. I'm not trying to challenge hold. Let me throw like Floyd Mayweather, throw a name out. I'm not going to call it. Listen, listen. Just to preparing for that match was very stressful, okay? It took me away from my family all day. I'm thinking about training. It just, it just put my life on hold is stressful. I had to do it and I did it a hundred percent trained like a fucking Olympian you proved yourself after. After that match. I don't want to put any names out there. I'm not going to challenge anybody. I'm going to rest for a while and when I come back, the only names I'm going to bring up, I'm not going to bring up any names now on names that are going to generate the most money.

Speaker 4:          02:12:15       At the end of this page. You have nothing to prove. Nothing to prove you did it. Yeah. When it gets Marcella Garcia, he would fucking smash. Don't move the official. He's a really good friend of mine. Garcia is fucking amazing. He bet his head as he was taking them down as he was taking Marcel. Like I said it that he said he already had them submit it. On a side note, this fight is dope. Brian, would you ship your upper for two seconds about digit time? I find a hard time believing you really want to know the answer to that question. I think you just wanted to talk.

Speaker 4:          02:12:54       This is to win the ultimate fighter heavyweight, Brazil Skype chat and not talk over people. Man, you're really bad at it. I am not talking over this. It was just talking to San Antonio. Carlos junior is a beast. Man. I'm super impressed by this kid. Are you talking about this fight we're talking about Eddie Bravo. Bravo. What about Metamorris? Yeah. You guys now tune into the fights. You and Joe finally tuning into the fights and scolding me. One thing I want to make clear before we end. Henzel Gracie, I love you to death. The Gracies are a giant family. There's so many awesome Gracie's in there. There's only a couple that you know I'm not particularly interested in hanging out with, but there's a lot of graces that are awesome. Clark Gracie Hoes Gracie's, one of them arose grace, I'm sorry, hose Rosemary's. He's one of the coolest chicks on the planet. So Henner heroes. There's people, there's people in my family that I don't want to talk to. You know what I'm saying? So the Gracies are giant. So Hansa is one of my favorite people of all time.

Speaker 1:          02:13:52       Be Real clear. I love here on, I love Henner. I love luck. I love all those dudes. I do. I think they're awesome. I just think the way that the situation was handled, Ooh good. I'm done. Way Better. And if they were having a debate with someone, if they had to have a debate with a, say a guy like Jeff Glover, an impartial observer, I guarantee you there, Jeff Glover, his point of view and their point of view, it would be vastly different. I just don't think that they handled it well either way. Good for Jujitsu. We're talking [inaudible] happen

Speaker 4:          02:14:18       that way. Mother of Jujitsu. Joe Him the money. Hi Brian. I'm going to shut down my life again and train and do swim sprints, which are jumping. That freezer swims friends, you know, it's like sprinting and a pool out. You're just swimming as fast as you can. Just die, dude. Fucking you said water swim sprints. That's crazy. Hey, sorry. I'm not a suppression on last week. That's where I figured it was. But a week from now on podcast talking about how he does swim sprint, you know I will. No, I will do stuff. I go, I go. Especially if we have as a chicken, I need my, I need my sprint. I gotta get my spreadsheet. He has a chest off the chicken to be like, I find it's swim sprints. I helped me the most, you know when I was training for the worlds, I guess whatever. I never wanted to fight.

Speaker 4:          02:15:16       Gets busy with other stuff or bought a film project clock stop really close with Marky mark. It was a time I liked that. When Martin how to vote strength and conditioning. I was just naturally supple. Believe me, I like good friends with Leonardo Dicaprio. You had a Frank Young. Okay. That's right. It wasn't, you know I played pickup basketball with him once he was wearing a burette. Did he dunk on you put it in your face? No, I was more athletic than he is. Tie your hair up. You very specific. If you're a dude and you have like one of those, remember when Hickson Gracie had that? I think going with that. That's fine. That's fine. Brian's, you have like rubber bands but which you can't have. You can't have a Beretta can have a Brett. Nope. CanNot allow it. And he had chuck Ladell can if you want it to. If you're leaning on Keppra, you can do whatever you want. Probably. No you can't. It's 100% super nice guy. Enough money that he really doesn't give a fuck. And like the girl, he drives a Prius girls that wouldn't fuck him because he was wearing a burette. You don't want those girls, you know? That's right. He was swearing a burette to keep chicks away. He's like I told you when Carlos got the back here, this is the, by the way, this good is a monster, least fight heavy

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       fight companion podcast of all time. Yeah. Apologize to every, for everybody. For these guys. I apologize for Brian for nutshell nub about, sorry, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a Jujitsu freak bro. So he's a freak bro. He's going to train eventually. I lived one of these days if he could just get a place to move closer to his house. So he has an open invitation to train with Eddie Bravo or where Henna and here on Gracie has never been to it for so long. Launch a on drive too far away. Too Far. What's the best as far as the biggest coolest Jujitsu Gym? Is it Gracie in um, torrents be? It's amazing. Right? Salt. So many students for me to train with. Is that the biggest place you've ever been to? Because I've seen it online. They have like extra rooms and shit. Bunch of private rooms and big old mat.

Speaker 2:          02:17:14       The Mat space, it's like a custom made Jamey right where they have like a tarp over like some maps that are underneath the does that Matt get does that. Matt gets slippery. It does. When you get sweaty it's very slippery cause it's not like as good as like a Tommy. Those flat ones, those are the best. Right? Yeah. They have the wanes. I brought up the header one time. He told me, I forget the reason I ask when it's slippery, your bowel, you need more balance actually lets you, when you're winning you're sweaty. It's super slippery. Yeah. You've got to get used to that. So is it better? It's better to be on a slippery surface surface for a three technique. I don't know. Probably that make sense to you. Right on ice. That's a bad pass. Imagine if you could pass on ice. No, it totally makes sense. The one thing though, sucks up fat bag of Dicks for cause. If you're doing any kind of striking train wrestling, oh yeah. Either one of those. You're going to hurt your ACL.

Speaker 2:          02:18:08       He can't. You can't get your foot in the good position if you don't have traction. You can't choose where your feet go when you're scrambling. They just give out. Tear out their needs because of traction. Bolles especially, you're right. Damn football with artificial hearts, astro turf. What are we doing? Who's idea was that? Those see meant that was green. God, God. Oh yeah. My high school football field was astro turf. Way To go, but it gives you an unrealistic environment to kind of Denver, they can. Oh, with new technologies. Grass, special seats were good seasons there. It's fricking greenish shit. Everything's green. Just have to heat the frown. The ground's too hard when they throw astroturf when it's just, it's just not fucking worth it.

Speaker 2:          02:18:53       It's just cheaper to, you got to think high schools. They're like, oh, we don't have to pay anyone and take care of you. They do that now. Is it still astroturfing different? That's a combo net and hold now it's like a, it's like a fake grass. It has the feel of the grass has these little rubber pellets in it like uh, a lot of football fields or that now that's the latest ship graph. Rubber graphing, rubber grass with these rubber pellets. I'm going to Google it. Rip Apart. When you run on it with cleats, know that like these you'll, you'll like when you take off your cleats, you have these little black balls are rubber and it, but it's like, it's soft. Like grass, Eco Turf.

Speaker 4:          02:19:27       Is that what it is? Sure. Why not? Hmm. Back to this shit. It looks fucking really shit man. There you go. That's crazy. I have it. I have it in my garage. That looks real as shit. That's weird. It's amazing. It's pretty cool. That's feel great. It can be plasticky. No, it's made of lamb skin feels good. Another lamps feels natural. Alaskan company. It's called field field turf. There you go. Yeah. That would be the ultimate. If it was made from lambskin, then grass would tear off like natural grass, you know word. Hmm. Interesting. Yeah. This is what it's called. Field Turf. It's pretty cool. That's bad ass man. Field Turf. Huh? His Antonio Carlos Junior. Definitely one. That kid gets a bright future. He's a bad ass. Anyways, back down the NFL. How many stadiums and off the top of your head do you think I have this shit?

Speaker 4:          02:20:28       I would say is there a hybrid? Like there's some that's kind of like that, but there's real grass grown and they got like some crazy hydro buckeyes stone, like super high tech where they're growing grass. This shit out. The sunlight, the real, that shit man. It's more predominant in colleges I'd say in the NFL, not, I mean not even half, not even half of them are. I want to know what the latest is in the NFL with that shit field turf revolution. I'm getting that stuff from my garden. Why would you do the Super Lane? You could actually have ground fucking, I don't want it. I want, I want it to look green and I don't want to deal with that because we live in California. Bugs here though. You guys all in a nature on a regular day, five or six bucks, whatever. I'm not using, I'm not using Miranda around.

Speaker 4:          02:21:15       I've never seen the, you gotta be honest. Jungle. At one point in your life you had to like in Asia, right? I was in Indonesia and then in the right, how did you deal with bugs? You heard them coming from, oh, well it's as loud as grand central station. The jungle. There are bugs that are so crazy. First of all, you have to worry about the soldier ants. So you, when you slept the, uh, no, you had to worry about soldier ants that would come in and when they were hunting, they did everything in their path. And it's for whatever reason, when they climb on you, they bite you in unison. They like as a signal or something, you go into shock and then you get heat. So what you do is you will get eaten by ants in the jungle all the time. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:21:54       So what you want to do is when you sleep, you want to make sure it was the hunt at night. You see you have a raised platform, it's on posts and you have to dip the posts. You have to paint the posts in Turpentine Cause Turpentine, we'll stop them. If you don't do that, they will come up the posts and it will come into your place and they will kill you. Now sometimes you can wake up covering a Nance soldier, ants. You won't die because they're foraging. They're not hunting. So you sit there, you don't move, don't move. And they'll coat over you and, and not, not of you kill one. I don't know. You fucked up, but you don't move. Don't move. They will go over you and pass over you. So millions of ants will pass over you. But that's why in the rain forest you use a hammock.

Speaker 4:          02:22:39       You put it between two trees, sleep and you, the ropes that hold the hammock are also dipped in Turpentine. So and Oh, and when you're in the rain forest, I had to carry you think you think off works for this. Mosquitoes off. Get the fuck Outta here. They laugh at that shit. You carry a sulfur coil, a sulfur coil that you, that you burn and it's burning sulfur in front of you. That's how you have to hang out in the rain for us because otherwise bugs will eat you alive. Lot of people, man. Elephants people like go into an elephants. Because I was studying, I was studying orangutans. I thought, I thought I wanted to be a natural. I'm 20, I want to be a naturalist, I want to live in the jungle. And I was studying orangutans. So you, you track orangutans all day. Uh, do you know what that means?

Speaker 4:          02:23:25       Collect their feces and sift through it and figure out what they're eating. So Jane Goodall, you think she went through a lot of, cause they never talked about Jane Goodall. Yeah. Jane Goodall was a different thing cause she'd dealt with chimps. Now when you deal with chimps versus orangutans, Orangutans are fine. They're not going to kill you. Chimps are our live in groups or I can't tell it's a, what about the bugs though? Had I it that's in that first butts in the Congo. So yeah, you're dealing with major bugs. So they just never talked about them movies. They never talk about how she got attacked by bugs. Uh, I love that transition. And if you guys saw that, sorry. Anyways, no bed bugs. Bugs. And the biggest thing in the rant this Antonio kids bugs. Yeah. He's a beast, man.

Speaker 6:          02:24:05       I had an experience and you can wait in like whatever he decides to do is, you mean I had an experience, the worst vacation of my life. I had friends go do this, go to Costa Rica. We're going to party. I thought costs streak was like Cancun. Yeah. They'd be like, yeah, we're going to party it. Ed Clay. He goes, dude, it's just, it's me and like 10 people, chicks. We've gotta fuck. We got this man Shin on in Costa Rica that we're going to party. And I'm like thinking mansion, Cancun Party beach. So I said, fuck it. Let's go. We land in Costa Rica. Um, I thought we were in the city where we're going to party in San Pedro or San Jose or something. They go, oh no, we're just staying here for the tonight, the mansions. We got another take another plane to get to the mansion. I'm like, Oh shit.

Speaker 6:          02:24:45       We get into this prop plane. There's like six of us in there going, Holy Shit. Go. We'd be like, go into Jurassic Park, land on the outskirts of Costa Rica in this jungle town. Wow. And I'm thinking, I, I hate the jungle. I'm not trying to go to the jungle. I don't like bugs at all. I can't deal with that shit. That's a phobia of mine. I don't want to go scuba diamond. Right. Joss fucked that up from, I don't want to go into a jungle. I don't want to fuck with bugs. I'll go snowboarding all day, but I can go in and throw a damn jungle, see a DVD of it. That's it. So I got tricked. Uh, they didn't do it on purpose, but really I fucked up. I thought it was like can't coon. I didn't know where going into a, we get to the mansion.

Speaker 6:          02:25:24       I'm fucking freaking out inside. I don't want to spoil. I don't want to seem like a big, seem like a big pussy. I'm like, fuck, I got to hold it inside. It's daytime and go, Shit. What happens at night? We're in a jungle. There's a mansion in a jungle. It's cool, but holy fuck, we're going to get killed by these bugs. I walk into my room, there's the ceiling doesn't connect to the sidewalls cause if you don't have bugs, don't bother you. You don't. You just open the shit up. You want that breeze coming through your house. I walk into my room, there's 50 bees in my room. I put my bags down, I go downstairs and there's a guy that do to own the houses. Uncle stays there all the time ago. There's bees in my room, should I? I'm trying to keep my pussy penis under control.

Speaker 6:          02:26:03       I don't let anybody see the fear, but I'm thinking about when the sun goes down, what's going to happen? So what's going to happen? One of the jungle, oh shit, it's summertime. Turn on the ceiling fan, but don't turn it on on blast. Just bear it. Put it on low. It'll make them uncomfortable in the flyaway. Damn. You don't want to make them uncomfortable, right? Yeah, I go, I got to sleep in that motherfucker. So I turned on the fan on, on low, left it there. We all take off to, uh, to go. Everyone needs, you had to have your own ATC, four wheeler ATV. You got to have your own ones. So we were going to, as soon as you get there, leave your bags. We got to get our transport. Everyone's got to have their own. We're in the junk because if you don't have your own fucking ATV, you're going to be left behind.

Speaker 6:          02:26:42       So we get in the van to go to this to get our ATVs. And I said, are, are you guys uh, worried about the bees in your room? Oh my God. There was like a playboy playmate chick. She was there too, so yeah. Did you see all the bees? What are we gonna do about it? I'm mad at Dad. Yeah. And anyways when the sun, we went into town, got an atds I bought, I went to the local store and bought all their off about all their off. As we went back to the, we went back to the mansion. There's a pool, it looks like Jay z's mansion, pool, Infinity Pool and then you see the coast of Costa Rica. The Sun was going down. It was like from dusk till dawn. I went in the bathroom or just drenched my whole body. I used off like Mousse.

Speaker 6:          02:27:18       I put I drenched my whole body and we sat by the pool and I'm like, I'm not going to be attack. And you know what? The bugs came out first. The frogs come out and I'm like, oh my God, what do all these frogs? I thought we were being attacked by frogs and the old man goes, the frogs are going to be your best friend. Watch when the bugs come out. The frogs, you just see just like Braveheart of frogs and books shot. You never see the same bug twice. You never see the same book twice. I had to go and we had to get an, we had to go six miles, six hours upstream to where the, where the nature preserve was. The, we get into this rickety boat, Rick, and he like a raft and there are saltwater crocodiles everywhere. So, and there are accidents all the time when people crashing out of boats because they're drunk or they're whatever. And people, you know, getting and right. Two weeks before this, uh, they, they, they had to shoot this crocodile is huge. Salt water crocodile killed a kid. They shot it with an m 16 like 15 times and then it didn't die. So they put electrical cables into the water and electric heater to death. Right. There's no more. So then there's

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       that. We get there. My sister the first day, puts her foot in her sandal and goes in her inner clog and goes, my foot's on fire. My Foot's on fire poles, her foot. It's a, it's a fire and it's one of those ants. Any other vacation storage, Dad, it, man, that's [inaudible] for too long. You gotta jump in. No, he finished his story and I was just, I was and I was halfway through his piggy back. Nowhere near done, but I'm going to end it. Joe, you think fabulous can win this fight at all?

Speaker 2:          02:28:52       Well, it's a crazy fight when you think that meal chick is number seven heavyweight in the world. Fabio Maldonado not even ranked as a heavyweight light has a light heavyweight, not ranked light heavyweight. He's, yeah, he's a light heavyweight. Not ranked as the light heavyweight. Probably somebody that one 85 no one is a guy who carries body fat fighting as a light heavyweight, but no one has also been an incredibly durable guy and undefeated as a pro boxer. Yeah, but it's deep. It's deep. It was a train partner of mine. Homeboy can wrestle, man, I think. I think we'll see some of his wrestling tonight. I wonder. He's a smart fighter and one of us are going to try and do Fabio Maldonado. He is a, he's a fucking blood and guts fighter man. He is the epitome of a blood and guts fighter. That guy can take a fucking beating that hair.

Speaker 2:          02:29:38       Very few guys can take a beating like Maldonado, Ken, and he's got vicious body shots. His left hook to the body is fucking nasty, but he's going to be so outsized. I mean he's nowhere near the same size. Like when the two of them get inside the octagon, I think you're going to see a big size of security for stupid meal check. How much? How much more? How much heavier Steve Bay? Well Maldonado waste two oh five when I weighed in at two 12 tonight I think ma'am and then Steve Bay was around two 30 God, look, that's not that bad when you consider the fact that cane regular fights guys that are much heavier than that, but we gotta you gotta think he looks small, right? The Nanos a small light heavyweight and he's not exactly a shredded, uh, to 12 great boxing. No ma'am. It was nominal bonds. Really sweet.

Speaker 2:          02:30:26       It becomes really interesting. Are they fighting and heavyweight short notice because junior dos Santos in steep, it was supposed to be the headliner. Junior got hurt. Had to pull out. They broke his hand. Yeah. You look, what's interesting about it is because so much is on the line for Steve Bay, so it's, it's really a, it's not real. It's a lose. Lose a steeper if you don't destroy this guy. People are like, Dang man, what the hell happened? Even if he puts up some sort of fight and he's essentially saving the card. It's really interesting to know heavyweights were prominent enough to take that position. You know? Thinking about how this is a short, I didn't get a call. I would have took the fight. What'd you're talking about? What? It took the fight. I was in shape. I could've fought Andre Arlovski three weeks ago. Mom, my, my resting heart rate on Friday was 37 Whoa. Holy Shit. That's ridiculous. That's crazy. Mine 65 damn man. I got to start training. I'm going to do some call spreads yours.

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       Yours is 112 specs. Brian, back to Brian. He brought it back. I'm just saying, dude, I got to start taking my training more seriously. It's crazy. Yeah. You keep bringing it back to yourself, but I'm going to videotape it so of course I'm going to bring it back in the conversation. We'll look at this getting all these sensitive girl. You're getting bullied, bullied online quickly. Seriously. Guys, online attack. Joe, stand up for me and everybody.

Speaker 2:          02:31:47       Was it good fucking, I'm actually, I have a lot of Jon. Anik was telling me he was surprised they didn't call me to step in for this way. It's interesting. I would've thought, well, you know, I guess they will. You were originally scheduled to fight hunt. What happened in that fight? He kept saying he was hurt and then we're supposed to fight in June. They said it wouldn't be ready to fight in June in New Zealand. So then I was like, dude, I had a fight. I can't wait to go like that if you're gonna eat, it helps. It sounds so cool. How loud? So loud. It sounds cool to you because your heart sounds so cool. Then I choose snacks like Mark Hunt. He kept getting prolonged, prolonged, and then I was like, dude, I have to have a fight. I, I don't want to sit out that year.

Speaker 2:          02:32:24       And then they called me the Andrei Arlovski so I didn't want to wait and now he's fighting Roy, which be like, oh, shop. Are You mad? Hell No. That's an epic fight. I can't wait to see that fight. That's a great fight. Believe me, my time will come. Oh Shit. That was a fucking, he just threw down a declaration. Mark Hunt's time will come. Dodged a bullet son. Uncle Dana saved Ya. Whoa. See that? Everybody pause. Just pause. Let that sit. Yeah. I think Fabio Maldonado got the call because he's Brazilian as well, but I know I heard he texts Joe Silva was like, Yo, I want this fight now.

Speaker 4:          02:32:56       Probably wanting to fight in Brazil. Fabio Maldonado is an example of never looking at a guy with his shirt off and think he's a pussy. Just by the way he looks like they fade or kind of everyone knows that. Well thanks. Thanks for taking any other brain under guys. I guess it's shit. I'm Brian [inaudible]. Brian [inaudible] guys apparently shit on Brian Saturday, I can't think. Well, Billy Madison quote for how about fucking mark? But seriously, we were talking about Mark Hunt who looks like deceiving more than mark. Hi Roy Nelson, and they're fine. They're like professional athlete to up my ass. I grew up with island people and I would look at Mark Hunt and not fuck with them. I don't care what you wrote. What I to fuck with market. I grew up in Tahiti. That's what I thought you couldn't look you could you remind me of Tahiti and the funny, Brian's a bit of the heat.

Speaker 4:          02:33:47       He told the story. Brian, good question. Why don't you talk to him? When you went on vacation and all the incidents you saw [inaudible] this is Tahiti. I had my shirt, shirt. I watched it. Question. Thank you for asking a question actually. When I was in Tahiti, have you ever seen the snakes in Tahiti? Oh, they're great snacks. Well, Hey, I was playing with a snake and Indonesia. That is six minutes of my life. I'll never get back playing with the with a stick, but what they call the cost comes up and goes, young man, that snake bites you. You will be dead in a half hour and we are six hours from any hospital and I went, okay, I'll stop playing with that snake. Good stories. Stop the animal. Good story. Good story about snakes guys.

Speaker 4:          02:34:33       That was funny. I bet. Right? I see Eddie and he's got my back. You to shit around Karen. When your back's against the wall, you learn how to turn it around. Look at Steve by chewing gum. He looks pretty calm areas, lady and gentlemen. Steve Bay. He looks hard. You can work that in you does your act. You could be like anybody knows a lot about MMA but he just, has anybody ever walked to the oxygen? I'm looking at higher. God, he looks ready to as high as fuck. He does look super, super high also as a full time job as a firefighter. Is that right? Yeah. I just said that doesn't look good. Why are you throwing them under the bus? It doesn't look like he's even remotely warmed up. He looks like he's just like, well here we go. By the way, if you have a job as a firefighter, it's one of the best jobs to do other shit cause you have four days on, four days off, two days on, four days off, something like 24 hour shifts and the um, you know, a fire house of, it's a good firehouse is a great place to work.

Speaker 4:          02:35:27       Obviously. It's a very dangerous, obviously there's a lot of responsibility. My friend Ray back in New York was a firefighter. We used to call him ray, the fireman and he fucking loved it because he could do all kinds of shit. While I was at work, he learned how to be a cook because they would have times where they didn't have to do anything. The fireman, you call them natural creators, it was at a pool hall. Why Things Charlie? Where's he from? White plains. You know, I love it. And Tommy Bell, Tommy's from Malvern. Martial arts studios. Have that to my friend Brendan the fighter. Yeah, there was Deli Steve. Yup. Cause he worked at the Deli. How they can't leave the firehouse? No, when they're on they cannot, won't go to the store. Maybe they can go to the store. They do shifts and shit like that and I'm sure they have to stay at the station.

Speaker 4:          02:36:09       You might be right out of the deal. You can't be driving around just you get a call, you got to chill and firehouses to have such a cool like chief the let's dude. But he has, I'm on call. It goes dude, you got to meet us at the fucking, well I'm sure they covered our basis. I'm sure they cover their bases. You know like when a guy is scheduled on, you know it was probably another guy that's scheduled to go shopping for them. You can do push ups all day. That's the thing. You can do a lot of training and a lot of those gyms in firehouses are pretty stocked up. And they did Jujitsu. Heavy bag. Steve Bay played baseball. Play baseball. Yeah. Pro Hours. He was drafted. Never played complete baseball at Cleveland State and wrestled. Good athlete, man. Great Athlete. Who Deep Bass Guy. Oh, he's American. He's just weird creatures and stuff, I think.

Speaker 4:          02:36:50       Yeah, Croatian descent. He would wear the cro cop shorts every day when we trained. It was weird. He speaks perfect English. Oh yeah. He doesn't speak any notion. Yeah. Pick six, four, two 30. [inaudible]. These are heavy waves. Six 14 so a little bit bigger than you, Bro. I don't know about that. I haven't. I mean just cause I got training right now because if I do eight issue after pool sprints, Bro, I hear that whole spread luck. You pressing my hands as long as you, as long as you don't hit me back. I can fucking move about your jab. Jab, Jab, jab is lightening. It's viper quick. They call me the viper and the job. Am I right? Yeah, he has to. He's got to stop with the heart thing kills me. I'll, I told Eddie to stop chewing in front of the thing I'm showing in front of it.

Speaker 4:          02:37:54       Mows your cards. Password. Brian. My guard passing is, is a, um, they call me slick and did you Jujitsu to circles. That's what I heard honestly. But I caught myself with oil. If you were a referee, would you do a heart or would you call it with your own mood? What would it be? I do a Haka dance. Could you do just a ball crater a ball and hold the shaft? No movement. No. Instead of this, know what I was doing. Do you do that for me? I'm like, this, could you do that? There's no way. He was a fighter. Like if you lost the big batch job, you remember when? When I'm a fucking Dennis Hallman lost that bet and he wore those little skivvies fired. Then they get fired, but he got in trouble. He wore like the shortest old school valley. Today's top. That was Marco [inaudible]. He used to, we used to wear those speedo karate. They do this thing instead of doing that one like that with the fist over. If you just do like this, it's basically you're saying to the balls and hold the shaft. There you go.

Speaker 4:          02:39:02       Oh Dude, wait. [inaudible] the difference inside, but people don't see that much of a difference. I do. Oh my God. Optical illusion. I want to call it out like that. I wouldn't call it out like that. Let me see when they're moving. He's a foot tall. No, he's so much bigger. Come on. Fat. Does Fabio look like the owner of crossfit? A little bit. Little bit. It's not a big deal though. I can throw down. I'm going to go with Fabiano of Malden. Ira. No. Oh, snaps hit him right away in the face. Fox Care from me. There's not that big of a difference. The steep. Oh No, no, no. Five survive. STP backed off control. He's going to come back home because it comes super competent. Going to put this guy asleep. No, he's not worried about it at all. He's so much bigger. Didn't exactly. He heard him smart. He's not rushing in and all that's a veteran move. That's expanse not rushing in there. Oh that's what's not fair. He's way too big. Come on. That's it. He's waiting. You. Oh boy. Jesus. He's telling me. Oh check way to hit way too hard. Nobody ever did that, that fight.

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       Let's be honest. What's absolutely be honest. The only reason why sanctioned that fights cause it's in Brazil, they wanted to save the call. Denato asked for it and it'll save the card. You're absolutely right. In Malden. I was such a beast. People like, you know what? Give him a chance, but look at this man, boy, boom, that right hand. That's why if it really is an 85 or fighting a elite heavyweight, that's exactly how it should go down. Knock you out, Brian. That's honestly, I would have rode that shot. He called it an 80 fiver. He could have been 95 and he wasn't even really elite at light heavyweight. It was just tough. Oh, he's just a guy. This is a dangerous matchup. It's super dangerous. It makes me sad. Nobody ever did this to him before, but you're dealing with a totally different kind of thump and that's what Brendan was talking about. He's talking about the difference between flyweights and heavyweights. This boom, damn, that's hidden looking like he punched him hard either rock hearted. It looks like he punched him lunch. How dare you say, right, right.

Speaker 5:          02:41:10       Agree with [inaudible]. Straight ride on the jaw from a heavy loud,

Speaker 2:          02:41:17       from your vantage point. It doesn't look like a, he like he won't wound up. He just like a short jab punch. Isn't the gems perfect. Punch a short by not giving him credit. He deserves Brian. Listen guys, I think Steve Bay's uphill both ways.

Speaker 5:          02:41:32       I say hi. No route for Brian. Hey Brian, how come you not giving them credit? I'm like, I thought about it. I'm like, I thought maybe you were doing let me how much automatically, but did he really? Did you really say that? But that was, I'm just saying it was a deceptive is short. Right? Of course it's gonna Knock 'em out, but I just, it's not, it doesn't look like he hit an Sro haymaker from his hip. Right? That's what I'm saying Brian. It was a perfect right hand. Well you haven't seen my right hand. I've seen it all. We want to talk about emotion. I've seen real kick to see here. What else do paid? Wildly impressed with that. What would Joey say to Brian if he was here? Right. Listen, cock. Cocksucker enough is enough. And then what the fuck you talking about? That it, that right hand hit you. You'd be back in Afghanistan looking for frogs.

Speaker 5:          02:42:19       You'll be on the jungle cock sucker. What your fucking Turpentine [inaudible] Paul's fuck face. That's a good Joey Diaz impersonation. Get back in the fucking jungle and we've for waters guys, I'm, I'm discussing it and fucking right hand hit you. You wouldn't even know a million ants walking over you. You'd be sleeping like a baby answer attacking you. You'd wake up, it'd be fucking three days later. Skeleton, no aunts, no nothing. Even the answer. Feel sorry for you. This motherfucking so alcohol. We can't even eat them. It'd be a travesty. That's like jungle laws, like some universal jungle harmony. Just to respect the answer, we'll go around you and eat an elephant. He was right here. Boom. Yeah. Jesus' bride, the temp. I don't even

Speaker 2:          02:43:11       understand how he went down from this fucking perfectly pleased. Right hand shot, 240 pounds, super heavyweight, all knuckles. That's a lot of weight behind that. Find some God damn telephone poles striking you in the face. It's not fun guys. You made a mistake, Brian? No, I'm just saying there are guys who take that car to go. You just realize you made a mistake. You'll be waking up in a fucking tent back up, back up, back up. Some of the horses run on corn flakes. Brides just back up. He must've not written. You know how long has junior high for anyone? No broken hands, man. Broken hands where a motherfucker, you know when you get them, that's the other thing you started getting the more often. I have no shirt on. Vituro has had, cause he forgot his and he had to give it to him.

Speaker 2:          02:44:01       He's ready to fight. He's mad. You can uh, yeah, they do things you can, they do things to protect your hair plates in their surgeries. But the bottom line is once you start breaking your hand, it's very likely going to break it again. What did you put the plate before you break? It would all depends on how much time you let it heal before you get back to training. That gets a place. Brandon. Um, shit, we fucking not gonna we didn't watch the Alaska is one punch. We didn't watch the, uh, the full, um, Moose saucy fight. The Musashi versus a, we didn't see the cut on your elbow. Can you imagine that? A right now there, there's no laws against that. They should jump on it. Don't wait for it to break. Jump on that. She did like a wolverine thing. Yeah. Why not? Let me,

Speaker 6:          02:44:45       I'm going to find it here for us. Find it so we could watch Moose Aussie and there's no way he goes. No, unfortunately it's, it's on my, we'll watch the whole thing since we have the, uh, the time. Brian Stann, John and I live in Brazil. Steve Bay. Me. Oh chick man. He's a motherfucker dude. He is a motherfucker. Kenny Florian and Hunada do that scene from heat. [inaudible] no, you have no mat. Dude. Hit natto and Kenny Florian and do the scene from hate where they sit in the diner. Oh, that's great. It's fucking incredible. Really fucking octal doing Robert De Niro. Oh my God. So there's a lot of insights. Shit, they got to see that. Most people wouldn't. And that on Youtube. Yeah. Oh my God. I'm having a hard time. He's got his own shop. He's got his own Internet show that there's a huge smash called the handout [inaudible] Andra show that's being produced by flex point.

Speaker 6:          02:45:45       Oh my God. You go to Youtube licks point and not the Laronza do. There's a, there's a scene where he not though gives Darth Vader at Jujitsu lesson and he gives it to after the lesson, he gives him a stripe on his white belt. Darth Vader. For some reason this thing is not allowing me to fast forward it. I'm having a hard time figuring out how fast needs to buffer. Yeah, it must be. It must be cause loop bar not as fighting. And he was earlier on that car. Yeah. Do you wanna Watch his fight? Yeah. Go for it. Do you guys want to do that or you want to get some dinner? Cause it's almost 10 o'clock. Starving. Yeah. Let's just watch this. Musafa goes the decision loop by net loses sigh. Oh Shit. I can't believe you just get that shot. Now I'm trying to eat some type move. Oh Brian, give me some air to heritage.

Speaker 6:          02:46:35       Yeah, it's buffering in southern California. You want to go to my show tomorrow? Eddie Bravo. invitational.com tickets are 25 bucks. We made it nice and cheap tomorrow at four 30 and what time would end if people, it all depends on how fast the matches go. It could end in an hour or it could last time limit. It's just submission. No, no, no, no. It's submission only 10 minute rounds and we have a submission based overtime like extra innings like we go over time I get to get on your back would double over under with both leg hooks. What it's like extra. It's extra innings either if I get you then you get a chance on my back. If I escape then I win. It's like extra anything that's cool. But if you tap me too, then we go another extra that's like overtime college football chance to, it's exact, we both get a chance to attack our overtime, you know, 10 minutes, 10 minute rounds and then a three, three maximum over time innings, extra innings.

Speaker 6:          02:47:35       If we go three innings and it's still tie like maybe the first round both got a sub second round, both escaped third round, both escape. So you could sub each other more than once in a match. It's like extra innings. It's like, so it's supposed to get a chance. We go into overtime instead of overtime being based on wrestling. It's like whoever has the best wrestling will win. A lot of wrestlers will stall and, and, and want to win in overtime because they know that wrestling has dominant. We're trying to eliminate that. So what is your, uh, how does it work? Let's say we go 10 minutes and there's also a mission. Let we go into overtime. You get to you, it's like extra innings and baseball you get, you're the, you're the top half of an ending. You get my back, both leg hooks with an over under.

Speaker 6:          02:48:13       If you submit me now I get a chance to get you. If you escape, you win. Cause I couldn't score. We both had a chance. You scored. But if you tapped me to, they only go on other ending. Then you get on my back. I escape. Then I get on your back, you escape. We'd go another ending. So and then the next inning you tap me and then when I get my shot you escape. You win. That's interesting. Basically this idea. Lots of cannabis, lots of cans allegedly. Yes. Yes. We've uh, we've been doing this at the Midwest submission challenge in the Midwest and it's working out great. Uh, you know, so we're trying it out and the whole, the whole format was all designed to try to make Jujitsu exciting enough. So networks would want it Eric, cause we got dog Frisbee, we got ridiculous sports.

Speaker 6:          02:49:05       Be An Eric. We have to have, there was no reason to not have Jiu Jitsu on TV. Right. But the only way you're going to do it is you've got to eliminate the points system. Cause that'll never work, right? We've had Jujitsu with a point system for 20 years. We don't see any TV out. No one people have looked at it and they're like, no way. We can't put this on TV. So it has to be submission only. And um, ultimately it's gotta, it's gotta be about money. It's gotta be like a game show, like a 60 man bracket and the guy who wins it all, he's the only guy who gets paid then that'll increase the urgency, make it submission, only give some mission, uh, uh, submission bonuses and incentive. That way you throw so much money out of these guys are in there to make as much money as possible.

Speaker 6:          02:49:44       Right? So that translates to entertainment for the guys watching because you know, that's really who important here that the audience, we want to make it to the audience can't wait to see this shit. And the only way that's going to happen is you have, you provide you Jitsu matches that are incurred rattle bowl. You're like, Oh shit, yes, there's still going to be some boring matches. But overall you want like 60, 70% of the matches to be exciting enough so that your average UFC fan will enjoy. Because right now most UFC fans do not want to watch the moon. Dealz then do not want to watch ADCC there and the MMA, they don't want to watch they dip into it. We, there are so many people that in the, that are fans of the UFC that would be down for grappling and they would down be down to watch it even though they didn't do Jujitsu. If it was exciting enough and that's what I'm trying to do, I may fail miserably, but I'm trying, I'm trying to make Jujitsu as entertaining as possible. Uh, not to make money just to, just to make Jujitsu Cooler. That's it.

Speaker 2:          02:50:41       Okay. Musashi and looking at Marcos are fighting right now and uh, I started at while you were still talking, so back it up so we could all get the some marks. Game Plan. Here's all we worked on was movement and be unpredictable. Change your levels and not only just shoot for, take downs, but set it up with your big hands. But you can tell right away. He kind of just shoots from, that's way too far to shoot it right there. Especially on the gallic massage, getting harder and harder. Look, he's got ahold of her hard, he's got 'em up and boom takes him down, but lands can't control. That's amazing. Amazing, Amazing Bass by moon sauce. So the whole camp, the biggest thing was level changes and movement for mark. Don't get backed up to the cage and come over the right hand with the well over a Musashi's Jab.

Speaker 6:          02:51:31       It's easier said than done when you have a vicious striker coming at you. I'm just telling you that that was the game plan dog does it. I'm just telling you what the, the, the, our plan was and then obviously you see it come to live here, got that. Have long arms of wrestlers is Munoz, is he's top level in the UFC. He's facing a guy who didn't wrestle in college and he's having a hard time taking her down. It's getting hard to take dudes down. So when you're in a situation like this in a scenario where you're, you're Munoz and, and your, your sole mission is to take him down and beat him on the ground. And if you can't do that, which

Speaker 4:          02:52:06       is coming up all the time, he's forced into a kickboxing match where he's um, outclassed. Honestly, this is why it's hard to take them down cause Musashi doesn't commit to his punches. He just don't rush in. He's always using his linked, you'll see me, he's jabbing, jabbing, leaning in the right hand. He never rushes in at the waist. He's got a good start. His basis far back is basis very far back. Look how low is too low. He gets to the office and by pulling back when your low like that, you give yourself an extra six inches where that dude can't punch you. Yup. Smart. It should be how low he is.

Speaker 4:          02:52:45       Musashi was really fucking impressive in the Machida FY two man Witchita obviously it was more impressive, but I was, I was impressed by his ability to take a shot to Machida head kick. That was a good shot by mark. That's a good shy. There's defended it in the middle of that shot. He could have pulled half guard and try to get on top another way. Cause there's two ways to get on top for mark. Either take him down with the classic wrestling take down that he's so good at or you'd take the long way to get on top. You can't take the guy down. He's hard, he's got good base. It's way easy to shoot and pull half guard and you've got to have some high quality half guard sweeps. But that's how Nogueira beat Tim silver. You've got to prepare. You've got to be super high level that every fighter should be trying to get super high level cause that's how Nogueira beat Tim.

Speaker 4:          02:53:31       Silvia Nogueira cannot take Tim and Tim Silvia was winning on his feet. The weight Nogueira got the fight to the ground as he shot. He pulled half gone, wind swept, swept him. They got on touch and then kill it. So crazy. Mark doesn't have the time to do that Jujitsu. You know what I'm saying? He's too far in his career now to learn that crazy 600 ad nasty crank. He would be amazing. He would be so confident where he could pull half guard and sweep instead of coming. It's just not as nature though. You know what I'm saying? He's got a, he's got to adapt because this is going to come. This guy's not even a wrestler and he can't take them down and it's getting hard. It's getting hard. I want to talk about these. I want to talk about these elbows. It's so crazy that you can do a downward elbow as long as it's on the side.

Speaker 4:          02:54:12       As long as it's side where it makes sense. It's totally ridiculous. Stupid. It's the same exact movement as a 12 to six. It's just common. It's going 12 to six like sideways. Who made that rule? The athletic look at that and if our athletic commissioner that amount, God damn, that mountain was nice. Yeah. If Munoz had a thick sick half guard, it would look a lot different. Look at it. He got him here. Can happen. Why not? Why not? He's not as he committed himself to that I met mark. Mark is going to fire you. Well why wouldn't he? I know mark very well. Mark's don't fight one more time in the Philippines and then call it quits. I bet is you've been thinking about calling it quits anyway.

Speaker 4:          02:54:47       Yeah. Maybe. Do you want to talk to about, my point is maybe he retires after this, but uh, I believe the out of sick. How old guard I would his old man, 36.
