Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Brownies, a one 80 for two brawny sweet 90 a piece. And you got visa at one 25 because my kid loves edible. We're live. We're live. How much you want one of these? Explain what's going on in that Joey. Fourth one, right? These are star. These are the stars. A debt. So these purple ones are 200 milligrams. This is what you know. This is a tech one knows I'll sleep for three days. This is one. How many, how many milligrams are in those 200 and this one? You just throw it 200 down. I want something to go. You got to go. No pick. I don't know if you know, but like an effective doses. 20 pop to 200 and in fact he'll drive. Well, why can't I can't. I can't smoke. I can eat. I can eat. I can open up with three of these. I can open up with 600 milligrams at bed at night like a baby. I put that mask on. I sleep like a fucking baby. Sometimes I get paranoid my sleep and I wake up at three in the morning with my heart pounds. I wake my wife up.

Speaker 1:          00:01:21       I tell you what, I'll tell you why I stay away from the edible cause like I like to smoke at night. Right, right. All right. Second High, one night and when I was at this one place, they gave me some edibles. They gave me a bag of popcorn. Okay, I'm a little stoned out and I just want something neat. So I open up the popcorn. Okay. Now the next day Valerie is, she can't figure out why I'm not waking up. I slept for 19 hours and she found the wrap up under the bench are starting to panic like what happened to him? I slept till till midnight the next day she goes so big. I said, I didn't know I was stoned out. I just want to some neat, it was popcorn. I didn't think they really like, they even get it in the popcorn. They make it with the butter.

Speaker 1:          00:02:11       These cannabis butter, I don't. They pop it in the butter and then they might even sprinkle some butter on top of it. Some cannabis butter and fuck you up. Take out fruit now. So they had a benefit of pot benefit at the store and they were handed out those bags, bags of that popcorn. It was fucking death. Death or open it up. It smells like pure, pure fucking weed. I felt so vulnerable. I just love how open it is now. Great. We can talk about it. You're popping them like tic tacs, but dice not everywhere else. If you'd tried to do this in Texas, they'll fucking dog cops waiting for you outside. Yeah, but I have no reason to be in Texas. You don't do shows in Texas? I don't believe in it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:54       No. I've gone to Texas, but like I, you know in Vegas it's great. Now they're opening up places. Yeah, they got five stores, right? Yeah. I haven't gone to any of them. I normally bring my on stuff, you know, or you know, if I go to New York, I'll bring my own stuff. It's one of the easiest businesses. And that the bar, at the end of the day, businessmen want to be businessman. They want to make some money and they, they look at this thing and they go, hey, do you have much fucking money they're making in Colorado? They made more money in taxes and Colorado from weed and they did alcohol. That's never happened anywhere. That's a fucking on. Definitely take weed over alcohol. I need 100% because you, you know what I always say like with weed, like a stone does, you are, let's take off a bit.

Speaker 1:          00:03:34       There's some kind of emergency, you know what I mean? You just throw water in your face. It's gone. It's not like alcohol, you know? Wait, you don't know what you're doing. Right, right, right. You know what I mean? You could perform on the weeds. You can bang on the weed. You could bang more on the wheels. Better. Listen, he's dying and on the way you read one of these stars, ain't no water going to help you find an apartment. You're eating like a pint of this stuff. Talking about smoking pot in the meridium was til I go home. At night after doing comment, I'm so fired up geology that calms me down. It was one of these h bombs and a fucking joint of death. Like I'll smoke three pipelines. Does God, have you ever seen his periscope show? No. It's the best thing. And they do it at eight 30 in the morning.

Speaker 1:          00:04:23       I just go out there and start giving advice and stuff. She gets in trouble for doing both. Like I was doing a periscope with wheels, you know, and I get a call from Bruce, he's going, what are you guys doing? Because we've got all stoned out and now we're in the bathroom of my hotel room. He turned into like into a steam room and you could hardly see it. She seemed like fucking glasses, you know? And I get a call from him, he's gone, what are you guys doing out there? They go, no, it's, it's, it's a new show. I'm doing the periscope Scott pickle thing, you know, and he goes, this spending millions of dollars from showtime to film this and you're doing it for nothing. Get it off the air, you know? Right. Bruce, didn't you get, I got a whole thing happened. That's ridiculous advice.

Speaker 1:          00:05:12       What would you take that off the air? Because we were first going to film my series, you know, and they go, they're writing episodes about this. You can't just periscope it jumped, try to change his image. He's killing it. Who let the manager in here? You got to understand this guy has got a history you would love, you know, cause stumble one, he, he's, he built the whole career again, but you can't tell someone to not do periscope or they're not do twitter. I understood that Martin, when a networks putting up millions of dollars, the first film a show, right about these things. I do. You don't just get it up off the air. Fuck yeah, of course. He felt bad about it. About seeing you. Well, only bad part was like, I had this, this, this fight with wheels. Like where I attack them in the room and we'll just go and you know, I go, he goes, you know, I'm a wrestler.

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       You know, I'm like, yeah, okay. You know, I'm not worried about it and I, and I'm having eleanor do the filming where I come into the room and I and I jump them on his bed and he actually got me, he flipped me off like a professional wrestler. He legitimately got me. Do you know how angry that got me? It looked like an hole. The tap you out or did he just know he pinned me. I was done. Like he really knows that and to that shit. He's like a genius with certain things. Like I would understand if you could do it. I get what you can do, but I'm going its wheels. There's no way he's on the bottom of ready. I got him and he just flipped me like a toy. See now if you filmed that and put that on Youtube, I put her, I put it on the the periscope pickle thing.

Speaker 1:          00:06:53       Why would you ever take something like that down? Because I got yelled at. I always get an up to sit. I know that way of thinking. I know the way of thinking, but the more view the better. It's just going to make people want to see him. It was funny fucking shirt. It was funny. It's crazy when you were, when you were doing that. Sorry. I was, I remember doing that filming at the store. You were doing that fucking years and years and years and years ago. You do little sketches. No, well I want to take all that stuff now and just cut it up and do like little three minute things and put it on that funny or die stuff because everybody was, you were in it every month. Everybody played apart. Bobby. Hey, do what? The foreign comic, uh, my, which your Bronnie we'd call them the foreign comic, you know, and it was just these crazy epic, I remember you coming over to me one night and you go [inaudible] give you something because that was using the comedy store like a set, you know, I'd be filming, I changed all the lighting in the kitchen.

Speaker 1:          00:07:54       I couldn't the red lights and blue lights for filming. I was doing it for a year and the cut and waitresses would come in to get like drink orders and I go, I can't have you in right now. We're filming. You can't be in. You're in my shot. And everybody's asking like managers, like what show is this? That was no show, but everybody was in it. Steve Reynolds easy was in it. My black was mike book. Oh, I become friends with my fucking black. So for whatever reason, I come over to this guy, he's sitting in the booth and the kitchen and I go, Hey Mike, do you want to, you want to be in the show and he's going to watch you? I go, it's, it's, it's a reality show. And reality wasn't really happening yet. It just wasn't happening. So people like, well, what is I go, you just do what I tell you to do.

Speaker 1:          00:08:45       Just say what I tell you to say and do what I said. So what? He goes, yeah, I want to be in it. You know, I go, okay, we're going to go to the top of the bellies, the, uh, the belly room, the steps. And I'm going to throw you down the steps. Okay. And I, I got to get a couple angles, so we'll have to do with two or three times, you know, and he goes, wait a minute. He goes, what do you mean you're going to throw me down the steps? I go, yeah, from the top. So you just go with it, you know, just fall down the steps. And he goes, I don't want you to do that to me. Like A, why not? What's the big deal? It's what you do. He goes, what do you mean it's what I do. I go, aren't you a stunt man?

Speaker 1:          00:09:22       And he goes, where'd you hear that Echo? The comics told me that that's what you do besides comedy. You're a stunt. He comes, I'm not a stunt man. I don't want to be thrown down. I want to be in it, but I can't have you just towards me down a full flight of steps like that. I'm going to get hurt. So we had to do it in pieces, you know, which I like a fake fall. Well, no, he would go like halfway. And then I go to the bottom of the steps to get the rest of the fall. And then I tried to like kill him with a chair and Ari Shaffir jumps on me at the right moment to stop me from killing the sky. It was always, oh, I could do just so I could do a line from a bronx tale where I'm on top of him now.

Speaker 1:          00:10:02       And I go, I did this to you. And he goes, what will that mean? I go, don't worry about it when it's edited, you'll see the whole series. The image. Yeah. I got Jay. Yeah, doing what I tell you this, cause I'd go over to comics and go, all right, look that way. And in second say that guy's going to have a fucking problem. And he goes, but there's nobody today. I go, don't worry about that part. They'll be somebody on the other end. That another time. And that's how I would piece though. So I want to take these tapes, just have some, some editor do like three minute because it was, I did it for two years, did come to my house for a barbecue. It wound up fighting. Eleanor gets into a fist fight with steve run easy. His wife, where he screaming, knocked the shit out of a, she's got her up against the garage because she said eleanor like, you know, was, is like the house is filthy.

Speaker 1:          00:10:56       You know, and Eleanor was screaming at me in the kitchen go and she said that when I'm so fucking Nice to, Huh, I'll handle this right now in Illinois. It comes out of the backyard now the comic sitting there don't notice is going to, and she goes, hey bitch, this is to Steve's wife, right? And she chases us slams are against the garage that's beaten. The shit out of Heller was a pro as Mike Black and Dave Taylor and Steve Simone and my own kids screaming, Kayla, just fucking kill her. And the end of that episode is Dave Taylor, you know, at night sitting around going to go into stand. Do you know why all I know I did that because girls like tracy, but taking guys like you from eleanor all her life and everybody's good and Steve someones going. Yeah, the way Illinois was hitting, like you could just feel it, you know, like raging bull.

Speaker 1:          00:11:52       Like she really wanted it. Damage. Yeah, it's a sterile. That's why we'd have barbecues just to film. It didn't, it was nonstop. And he comes over to me at the sterling. What are you doing exactly what? You know, like, oh, just show my show what show, where is it? Where can I see it? I don't know. There'll be around and you still have the footage, all of it. Hundreds of tapes, hundreds of hours, you know, two fucking pauly shore, you know, stops me at the comedy store, you know, because my kids were in the show and they were like seven and 11 at the time. It's when I first broke up with their mom, so they'd be at the comedy store with me. You know, pauly shore comes over and I'm filming this fight between Ari Shaffir and Bobby Lee where, you know, Ari's like throwing boxes of, uh, you know, bottles of, uh, of, uh, bobby's head and everybody's cheering to kill bobby.

Speaker 1:          00:12:50       You know, and Paul, he comes over, he goes, how many times I going to tell you, you get these fucking kids out of the comedy store? And he says it in front of Dylan, who's a kid. So I tell, see Steve Simone, I said, take dylan outside cause that's the Vietnamese, you know, so I figured I might have to really damage this kid, you know, but yeah, it was going to hurt him, you know, but I, I'm going all right, then I'll get sued. So I just lay into them and I'd throw a glass at the wall, you know, to throw into the garbage and I leave the next day. Mitzi calls, she doesn't just banned me from the comedy store. She bends my children like, oh, you're the youngest kids. Definitely. If you've never been banned from the store, it's not a good day and you're the youngest to get banned.

Speaker 1:          00:13:36       You're not even eight years old. You know how good does this feel? And they're going, but we're not allowed to go back in. I go, don't worry, it'll all be straightened out. You know who hasn't been banned from the store? Exactly. It's the greatest. It's like a badge of, I haven't been banned after the shit you got. What? What was the fight you add a couple of weeks ago I would fuck. Oh, but no, I didn't get banned for that. You don't talk about that at all? Cause I heard, fuck you almost get into a wild Willy Parsons way back in the day. No, he said some shit in the main room. Well, you know, he was just, it was just crazy. It was kind of Nice and calm. He is now. Here's the problem that now I see. Well we got there, we were the young guys and some of the older guys were on the way out.

Speaker 1:          00:14:19       They didn't like that. So once in a while something would, something would happen. You know, and the same and it was like guys that would have for 10 years, nothing happened. Yes. There was a few of those guys. I'll tell you a great uh, Coco story over here. So we just became friends like the first year. I know this guy, you know, and he would tell me about every restaurant in the United States. I don't know, he knows every restaurant where it is, what they serve. If it's good, bad. But one night I come outside and he's getting into it with some customer. Okay. And he's sitting on the back stairs, you know, and I'm just watching cause I, I wouldn't want to really see anybody get hurt, you know, but you know, he thinks differently. Joey thinks a little differently, but he doesn't just want to hurt the guy.

Speaker 1:          00:15:10       What he does, he gets all eat it up and he grabs one of those tall like glasses from the comedy store and he breaks it like he's still in the middle of Cuba with the sharp edge. And I'm going, Joey, what are you doing? I could put the glass down, put the gun, and he really wants to like stab the guy in the throat with the guy. He's a customer. It's just a fucking customer and he starts laughing and he throws the glade sort of fight was off thing because then we know he's going to put this guy in the hospital because the guys did something about his act, you know that's stupid customers. I seen you go with the car. It's the funniest shit in the world. I saw him and he's like, Hey, I only want to say what you were doing. It was not, but you were like trying to get to this guy over.

Speaker 1:          00:15:57       The crowd. Outside on the side was a guy that came. He threw something at me. He threw something at me. He came up to the stage. I came out of the stage, threatened me and he said he was going to wait for me outside. That guy was an asshole. Jacqueline. He was hack on somebody before me to someone who was real mean to somebody before me. I don't remember who it was. It's just the violence involved in comedy now. It's hysterical. This was 20 years ago or whenever it was, but it's been going on that long and it's been a nice till. There's always going to be drunks. There's always going to be drunk, asshole. The drunks, there's some people that are drunk and they're fun. They're great, and there's other people that had just belligerent. They're gone. They're gone.

Speaker 1:          00:16:43       You do a ton of clocks show in Vegas. You're asking for fucking trouble. How long have you do a midnight? Those Riviera shows. Oh my God, that's nuts. Yeah. Now I just, if somebody is really like that, I just throw them out of the room. Yeah. You know whether they didn't do it. No, but I'll say really? I, I go, I'm not making believe. I don't like you. I go, this is my real emotion. I go, I have a hatred for you now. I go, you got to leave this room now. And then they think it's a joke and there's like two security guards stand behind them. I remember one guy looking going, you're kidding. Right? I'm kidding. Corona for what? I go, you talked, there is no talking in here like it's a classroom. It's just all in effect. And I know how you perform and I know how you perform, but, but I really get mad when they don't care what's going on with the performer on stage.

Speaker 1:          00:17:38       Chappelle was at the store the other night and some kid was yelling at him, interrupting, just yelling shit out in him. Just yelling, just yelling, shouting, what about this? What about that? Just different questions at him. And finally, people just started going, shut the fuck up. Like one guy yelled at and then it happened to be me. But some other people in the room yelled at and it just got to this point where people were like, stop this. But it should never get to that point. The, the management should step in right there. The, the bouncers. Outdoor gardens is a, is all comedy. Yeah, that's the thing. One of the store, the one thing about the store that's always been amazing is how many people who work there, who eventually became comics. Joey, uh, Ari Rather Dunkin. But, um, because of, of drugs were to fucking pull up, it will go running from the room.

Speaker 1:          00:18:24       Does he still do the fucking thing with the yeah, he's where he's like starting him. Don't tell him. Yeah. Don't give the bidder way. Not Matt Given the bid away. I'm just saying what happens to people. There's nothing better than sitting in the back of that room when people stuck getting frightened because of what? What the puppet, what's happening through the puppet and they start running for a, from that seat to leave the store. It's the greatest moment. Some ways my head against the wall, those moments somewhere out there, someone has the original puppet. If somebody stole it, I stole it. Really? Yeah. The original public has to do the new ones actually better than the old one now. So no Hobo puppet did to this fucking guy ready with a skull. That pump. It's got a problem. You fucked up. Yeah. You don't, you don't pop it and pop are, you're fucking kidding me with this irrelevant here now pop. It was fucking scary guy. I remember that twilight zone episode where the guy and the puppet, the puppet was fucking evil.

Speaker 1:          00:19:28       It was great. It was creepy. Now who is, who was the acting wasn't burgess meredith. He did the library with the glasses right at the end. Those glasses break. Yup. Yup. He can't read. Who is the guy from the odd cup ball? Jack Klugman. Jack Klugman did the pool hustler. Yes he did. And Jonathan Winters played the other guy. The dead guy comes back to life to play him. That's, that is a good episode. Fog. That's a really good, but that the dummy one was one of the most disturbing ones, you know, cause the dummy would like wait for everybody to leave and go camp man. You could rabbi just tell Kaleed like whoa. And they would change the language a little fucking areas. We show them in the, yeah, so people know him on right to, yeah, I'm dice anyway, just in case this is the greatest show.

Speaker 1:          00:20:25       You know, you're just getting it. I've done this before. You just get in it. Yeah. It's, well, it's like opie and anthony used to do this show. There's no fucking around. Yeah. Just have some fun. I love it. I love it when people asking questions. It should intervene when it to view. Yeah. Just have some fun. Oh No, I don't think, we haven't really done a formal interview. I wouldn't know where to start to a friendly, to me and to influential. I couldn't do any of your friends through the years for sure. Heard into Joe Rogan. No. Serious. Like from the time you came to the store, like you were figuring it all out and you became this. I remember coming over to Joe, he has a hit fucking Sitcom on the air and I'd always see him at the comedy store. I come over tomorrow night and I go, how come you a here?

Speaker 1:          00:21:12       Like, you have a hit show? Like, why aren't you on the road? It was gone. Yeah. You know, I got, there's a lot of fucking money on the road for a guy that has a hit show. And that's, I think when you started doing the road 100%, he also told it to a, what's his face? Uh, the guy who's the guy that, uh, works with, uh, uh, uh, Whitney camelot. Um, Kristalina. Yeah. So, you know, I would say delete like in the coffee bean all the time and he crushes on stage and I go, don't you go on the road? He goes, no, I'm writing material. There's, I go to the road, you have a hit show. Like what's wrong with people? I always thought as long as I was still doing standup, both the goal for a lot of guys, it was always to get a TV show.

Speaker 1:          00:21:58       Well Ari Shaffir I screamed at on the phone like when he started doing his show now on comedy central, I'm on the phone with them. This is like the first season at the beginnings. I call him. I congratulate them. I go, so do you know your next two or three moves? You know, if the show like starts taking off. It was, no, I haven't really thought about it. I go, why not? You're waiting 15 years for this. You talk to me about not having money to pay your fucking rent. Now you have a show. I don't know, maybe, maybe a club tour, maybe we caught an album, maybe do a comedy central special after that, you know, something like that. So if they happen to take the show and flushing the toilet after the first season you have a career because now people know you like fucking retarded, retarded.

Speaker 1:          00:22:52       Well already does a lot of standup. He called me recently and he told me all the shit he's stolen. It was 100% because of you. I started doing the road 100% yeah, I remember where we were. We were sticking to that. It was, you know, I don't even want to go back that far cause you've done and come so far since then. But it was like whenever I see a comic doing well, I'll always look to like, oh look, this is what you gotta do. Like you're nuts if you don't do it. Well, it meant a lot to me because when I was a kid, way before I got into comedy, I was fanny, yours and I was listening to you with this girl that I was dating once we were in the, in the car and we were listening to it on a cassette and a fucking house and we were howling.

Speaker 1:          00:23:29       And this girl thought you were the funniest thing ever. And that was what made her cool. Like she wasn't uptight because a lot of people back then, you know the people that don't realize sort of the course, your career's gone. Like dice was unquestionably a different thing. I give you the biggest comic ever. When I was a kid, 100% like when you were filling up arenas, there was a different thing going on where people could repeat your shit, they could say what's in the bowl bitch and you would see 15,000 people gone. Watson batch. It's so fucking crazy. And it was a different thing. So, you know, frustrates me when, when I talk about the arenas with anybody, you know, like, you know, they always bring up the garden, which was an honor, you know, to play. It's the most famous arena ever. And I did the two nights there, but uh, but I always tell these interviews, I go, do you understand?

Speaker 1:          00:24:20       I did over 300. So I go, the first tour alone was 26 cities, over 300 of these and they'd be gone in a matter of a couple hours before the facebook, before twitter, before fucking followers I go old people did was follow me into the fucking arenas. I go, I wasn't tweeting and arguing with fans on twitter. You know, it all became a thing. You became a thing from Rodney dangerfield on this book. It was so fast. It was gigantic. Like with, and this is all word of mouth, who my point being then you hit, there was a whole lot of backlash against you. It was so into it starting again. It's not really like, um, yeah I'm doing some interviews and like this one guy, I don't want to say what newspaper. Yeah cause it's all giant papers that doing these profiles, I mean now I'm going to New York next week.

Speaker 1:          00:25:12       I've got to sit down with the New York Times. It's like crazy shit. Again, this is like the buildup since I started doing your show from entourage to, you know, to the woody Allen thing and now scorsese and now my own show. It's like, you know, number one working with, you know guys like Woody Allen Scorsese was unreal and yeah, those are too crazy. But this one guy doing a profile piece comes in, he sees me in Vegas at the laugh factory where I've been doing like a little residency to stay like sort of low key till this hits now. And I'll, I'll, I'll announce dates later on the show where I'm performing. But anyway, so I, and, and I really wanted to give this guy a real show. And the way I perform now as is very, very theatrical. It's all acted out. You know, I sit in a chair, I'll stare at a guy that if for guy goes, I'm married 32 years, I'll actually fall down onto a chair and just look at him like, you're kidding me, right with I'd been married also a lot, but not to the same one.

Speaker 1:          00:26:17       Like I break it up. You throw a redhead and Youtube Burnett and for eight years the same thing. I go, you know, we might be coming friends now, but I gotta tell you as your friend in a lot of ways you hate yourself and I don't hate myself. I go, you don't hate yourself. You fucking the same girl for 32 years. What does that tell you? You admitted to me you never had an affair. Who does that in life? Who doesn't want to go out there and stick every fucking what box they could get their hands on? The tip of your fucking Dick to the root, to your balls. Just for the golf. And even if you get caught, you flipped the switch on your check. You Go, I did this for you. You were busy with the kids. You were busy with your new business.

Speaker 1:          00:27:02       I want to to stay wet. Every load sheet talk. I was thinking a, you now go make me a fucking steak. I don't want to talk about this no more. So let start. What's that? The report is, sees this. Yeah, and gets upset. So after the show he says to me, but obviously my show is a Gulf. It's comedy, it's a, and he goes, he goes, guys, now that you're being looked at it like as this like, great actor, now why would you perform? And I'm like, you kidding me? Right? I go, it's what I do. It's what I love to do. I'd love to affect people. I like people to walk out of a room going, I never seen anything like that. You know, like you know when you're looking at a guy in the crowd who's sitting with his wife and he's with his best friend.

Speaker 1:          00:27:49       Okay. Double date. And I go, let me tell you, said you got a best friend. And he goes, yeah, this guy, I'm friends with him for 25 years. He's your best friend. Did your best friend ever call you one time cause you got a hot looking wife. She's got them big kettle ball, fucking tits hanging down every holiday he gets to Haga little too close. Maybe. When was the last time your best friend I ever called you and said last night I jerked off thinking about your wife and the guy goes, no, I go, never. Right? Because he's really not your friend. I would call you. I would tell you last night I wheel barrel. Fuck this animal. She's walking on a hand picking up water with a teeth for me. You know I go and then you bang her. The way I tell you when, if it works out like my scenario, I'll give you the next scenario.

Speaker 1:          00:28:38       That's a friend, not a guy hugging. Your wife never turns around and says, Oh, I love your wife's fucking edge. The way those pants split hop fucking crease between a legs. You might think your wife is ugly because your friend never takes the time to tell you how many loads he drops just thinking about her. So don't tell me he's your best friend. He's your worst fucking enemy in the world. I'm the friend. It all make sense and you get negative feedback from this. That doesn't even make any sense. Well, no, because it's all done as a goof. Of course, like the guys going with. Why would you do that material? I go, well, what should I go on stage and go, you've been together with a woman 32 years. Obviously you love your family, you raise beautiful children. Nobody wants to hear that. But here's the question.

Speaker 1:          00:29:25       Why does it, why does it have to make sense? Why can't it just be funny? That's my whole bike. I'd like that. You know, I've always said that like when people would ask me like, what's your favorite kind of comedy? Like, I just want to laugh. Like when Joey is saying the most ridiculous shit, I laugh than anything I've ever heard in my life. It doesn't have to make sense to me. He's in a coma, but it's all fine. But it's like, how come? How come movies can be ridiculous? Ridiculous in in what they're showing you? Ridiculous. Right? Especially violent. When we think about how many violent movies raw every fucking couple months. There's some crazy movie where a hundred people get shot. It's constant, right? But a guy on stage just talking, it was just absurd ways about sex. Why is that pissing people off? But even in comedies, and it really started around the time that came, that came with, uh, what's, uh, I sit with those glasses on tests.

Speaker 1:          00:30:19       It's beautiful. But, but the thing is like, it started with the, uh, Mary movie that Matt Dillon did years ago was she's got a road trip come on and everybody's hysterically laughing. That's okay. But if you say it as a comic, it's like, why would you say that? Especially the way, here's what I do. But the way you're saying it's so, it's so over the top, it's easy. It's absurd. I don't understand why people don't just think it's ridiculous. Look at the last time I went to see a comic, it was me and Norton and Anthony Kumina and Patrick Kelly and Bryan red band. You weren't there were you Jamie? And we went to see you at the river. It was awesome. I had a fucking blast. I had a great time just sitting there as an audience members watching and there's some of the shit you talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:31:05       It's so preposterous. It's, it's, it almost makes me angry that anybody would have an argument with you. Like saying something wrong with what you're saying because you're saying shit. It's so rich. Like you were talking about someone how you, your kid could catch gay by the way. You Bang your wife but also, but also now I'm getting, I'm getting questioned who's dice? Who's Andrew? The liners. We share the same foot cause I wear to fingerless gloves all the time. So I go, we share the same fucking closet. What am I going to tell you? I don't know how to separate the two for you. Like men, they go crazy from that. Yeah, well they don't want to, they don't want to allow that for some reason. Like there's also to weird art forms the day allow people to act differently and acting. You become a character and then you're who you are off stage.

Speaker 1:          00:31:58       But then in comedy for some reason they want to combine the two always and sometimes it is, you know like some guys are exactly who they are, but like even now I'm self deprecated on stage. I talk about getting old or this and that, all that shit. Right. Years ago I never did any self deprecating stuff. You know what I mean? It's just, it just wasn't who dices dice was supposed to be. Just a comedic hero for people. That's it. And dice came out of your act where you used to do a bunch of different impressions. Right. All the impressions. Fucking fantastic. Stallone, I don't know what you're talking about. He's got like a great travolta, Travolta Love Jake. He got to work with them. Yeah, the Joey Guy, when I saw him in grudge match and I was like that's fucking great. Worked with two of my heroes.

Speaker 1:          00:32:46       And you also do a mean ass travolta. Who was, that was one of the Guy Pachino and the Eric. Rob. No, Eric Roberts. Eric Roberts. Back when the, when Eric Roberts was famous, Charlie, they took my fucking thumb child. Sometimes you've got a whack him. You say you put your coat on and you don't say gun, nighttime, nobody just village. That's just to humble them. That was a great fucking movie. That was a great move to me and say they don't cook. The contents of my ball is on. You can't believe you remember this. And I'm driving by the comments. Don't want to have to, don't just look at just looking for a free lunch. See if maybe some of the sandwich out at the comedy store and I'm rehearsing in the original room to take, I pull into the parking lot kind of bad. I'm like wow, these people here at one in the afternoon, this has to be 99 and I walk in and I hit a piano and I look in that and that's like 20 old people and Jeff is on stage playing and diocese on and he's doing this fucking thing cause I forgot the contents of my balls is on your fairly tech like famous standards.

Speaker 1:          00:34:01       Oh my God. How can the back of my bowl?

Speaker 1:          00:34:10       You can take my cock at of you boxes too. Good to be true. Yeah. Frankie Valli really liked that one. Even asks me like, why would you do that to my most famous? And he did that go. It's hysterical. I love you. You know, it could have been swearing to God, but I want it like a ballad. Don't you think that the blow back is less ridiculous now though? Oh No, a hundred percent barretts by the shit that saying about me with the acting. See when you sit there and go, you know when, when when I, when you came to know me, I was filling out all those arenas and all that shit. Like I take a lot of pride in that because I know I set a standard for comics that today when I see, you know, like Louis C k called me before he went on at the forum, you know, nervous.

Speaker 1:          00:35:10       He can't blame the guy. It's 18,000 people and I'm go on Louie. You don't have to do anything other than who they've come to love. Don't exaggerate it. You don't have to just be you. You know, because it's so many people, you know. But what I love is that, that some of the guys have filled those places now and I go, it's core site. I took the heat for it, you know, and I don't mind that history now. I didn't mind it back then, but I didn't realize the effect it would have on the future of comics. What was very important, and it was overlooked by a lot of people who were, you know, the talking about free speech all the time. I like what, what happened with you? It was oh really overlooked because there was, it wasn't that what you were doing was anything more crazy than anything that was in the movies or anything that was in literature.

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       Anything that was in books or magazines, even, you know, articles, what you were doing was just a really extreme version of standup comedy. I mean, that's how I get done life. That's when life really fun to watch. And some people decided that your character promoted, you know, in the most ridiculous ways, promoted misogyny or a tray, get hatred against gays. And it wasn't, and that's the funny, it was just funny fucking jokes. Right? But how can, and it was at a time, you know, cause I remember when Ellen came out of the closet, I love that girl. You know what I mean? I had nothing against gay people, but at the time I was doing this act is when they were fighting for their rights, when they want it to come at in the closet, you know? But when I was at, when I moved to Hollywood, Eh, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:36:47       Not now. You know, like uh, you know, with uh, what's his face? Uh, Caitlin Jenner. Yeah. Okay. Now, years ago when I would do a joke about that, you know, I would go and what's with these trans testicles? I go, you meet the girly a dreams, right? You'll wine are you Diana? You take it home, you put your hand up her skirt, you're holding the tree trunk. That's not hate. It's funny, you know? And now today everything's changed. So like when that happened with Caitlin Niche, she is doing a two hour interview about it. You know, it's all accepted. It's all good. I don't care what anybody does, you know, but it's just like, like I couldn't believe that backlash because I'm going, I say nothing about hating anybody. Even with the sexist remark, when they call him a sexist, I, it's not sexist. I go, I happen to love women and I love having sex with women.

Speaker 1:          00:37:41       And I love making fun of how people make such a big deal over sex. I go, that's all it's about. So I like to paint these bigger than life cartoon pictures, uh, of people having sex that they laugh at themselves because we put so much on it, you know, just so much on the act, uh, of banging your chick, you know, and, and it's the one moment in life when everything in the world that goes on, uh, you know, I'm sure you guys just said, I just lose myself in that. When, when my balls a bashing into Hawaii, I love for hours on end that my own wife has to say, I'm only a girl, you know? But it, it, it just take, I'm kidding about that. But, but the point is, it's like the one moment in your life, you know when you're blowing it out from the bottom of your, not big for more the pressure you might have gone to that day.

Speaker 1:          00:38:42       You forget the world for those moments. The greatest feeling ever. If I could laugh hysterically and becoming at the same time, I could die at that moment and I'll be happy to two greatest things ever to laugh as hard as you can from like something a best buddy would tell you that you can't control to kind of laugh where you go. You got to stop. I can't breathe and you're blowing your load. I could take death at that time. All good. That's a good way to go. Yeah, but how do you get the laugh gone? Because we topics don't make you laugh and calm at the same time. You have to play a prank on her and then you'd have to fight off guilt to really enjoy prank on your chick. She looks at you the same prank I do to you that you might laugh hysterical.

Speaker 1:          00:39:29       She'll go, why did you say that? Okay. All right, let's go to the mall. Ari and I were talking about that yesterday about a comics and saying do the meanest fucking shit to each other and it's hilarious. We were talking about guys knocking, Ari knocked a pill bottle out of some dude's hand. Synthol is mince flying but there was some I guess volumes that what it was or out towards 10 and there was like a vicodin or something in it. Something like that. But that's like that's typical comic shit. Right Joe, you've been with the second girl for a long time though as I feel. Have you seen little joey? Yeah, completely daughters. His daughter's adorable complaints. It's, we started talking a few months ago, I wanted him to play this bouncer and uh, and still rebels first video, you know, but he was, he was out of town so we couldn't use them obviously.

Speaker 1:          00:40:19       Are you, why are you having more fun now than you've had before? Thousand percent. It's lighter. Yeah. You seem like you seem real relaxed. Like, even when everything was going great for you, it was, you were, you were real stressed, but you seem like, cause she had, I had the whole, I was under a microscope. That's what it was. And you would one of the only guys that, that was it. There was Kennison and kiss and died and then you were still alive. And you were the guy that people would get mad at. And I remember when Kurt Loder was mad at, you remember that shit the fuck, what was that? Wasn't he mad at you? Everybody was mad. Did you do get banned from MTV for town? Some jokes about feminine hygiene products and what happened if you want the little MTV story that they keep throwing at me.

Speaker 1:          00:41:03       Also, what happened was I was booked or scenario was the host and I was booked to bring out share, which, uh, which, uh, which I looked at like that's cause I, I'm a chef fan. Uh, she, she was coming to my show, she came to the Wilton, the amphitheater, the La Forum, you know, so when they asked me to bring her out, it was like, that's great, you know, MTV awards. So now a couple minutes before I go out, uh, Dick Clark calls me over backstage and he goes, look, you might have to stretch a little because she is getting dressed. And I'm like, what do you mean she's getting dressed? She was nothing. She wears a thong in some nylons. That's the outfit, you know? And he goes, well, if you've got to stretch, Arcenio will come over and you'll do something. I go, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 1:          00:41:56       That's not how it works with me. I go, I've been watching this whole show. I saw Richard Lewis come on and just freaking eat it. You know, pull rise and try to come out and talk about this to an MTV audience, you know, 6,000 people at the amphitheater polarizers talking about the hats that Frank Sinatra, whereas crickets, you know, and my friend, uh, I, my friend, hot tub, Johnny says to me, he goes, look, you could go out there, you could be a tear drop or you could be a title wave. He goes, look what this guy's telling you, you're going to stretch. So now, cause he took me on the side and as he takes me on the side, if the Dick Clark talks to me, they started introducing me. So I'm angry. So I come out and I just go into my act. I do, uh, uh, the poem was the famous poem.

Speaker 1:          00:42:54       I think Georgie porgie putting in pipe jerked off in his girlfriends. I went awry was giant shut. Georgie fucked at one eit slut. Oh, you know, so that was like the poem I did, you know, and then I was talking about they kill, yeah. Killed, you know, my manager at the time, Sandy Gowan, if after, after I came off stage, they have all these tents with press and they took me from each tent and not one question was asked to me, but I got press for two years after that. I mean every day and the arena shows, if I was doing one arena show, let's say a milwaukee that with three now, you know, so it's doing, you know, 60,000 people for the weekend rather than 20 it Wa it was, I did all the 12 million people in a, in a four year span in arenas. And when that man, yeah, when it got bad, I was doing 10,000 people a night.

Speaker 1:          00:44:02       So you know, this is after they crushed Ford fairlane you know, and I'd be walking around New Orleans with my father and he'd go, you're supposed to be done and you're doing 20,000 people at the Sun. Don't tonight. What is wrong with Hollywood? You know, it was just insanity for many years. They just decided that they were going to black. That was, it puts you on the outs. And I remember watching it going, this is kind of fucking creepy. It's Kinda creepy that they all just decide that this isn't a valid art form. That the kind of shit makes me how laughing. Look, if you really meant what you said, you really were a bad guy. It wouldn't be that funny. It's funny because I know I'm a good guy. Yeah, it's, and it's, that's why I had this little argument with this interview because Fd saw me in Vegas.

Speaker 1:          00:44:44       The guy was telling you a few weeks ago, first he interviewed me in La, so he got to meet Max. He got to meet Dylan. And I know you guys know them and the kind of guys, they all, they're great. Can I actually say that? The two nicest guys I've ever hung with in my life, so well adjusted, not talking about the rock band when they're on stage, they all who they are, they're rock stars on stage. That's who they are. But when they're on stage, they're the most respectful, funny, nicest guys I've ever hung with. Not even as sons, just as guys. Cause they're both men now 21 and 25 and to hang with them, it's like a privilege to me because they're just great guys that could hang. They can talk to me about any fucking thing. Dicey. And Your Dad? No, but, but, but that's the beauty of them.

Speaker 1:          00:45:30       They know they could come to me with anything. Of course there was a, they just recorded that first full album. Okay. So there's one song called I got to have, and I call that the sec song because it's all sexual. All the words is sexual. And Dylan writes all the songs. So the night before he's going to record it, he comes over to me in the backyard, was smoking a, a blonde, you know, and he says, dad, did you ever really hear the words too? I got to have, cause we're gonna record it tomorrow. I go, well, in the clubs it's hard to pick it all up because of the sound systems, you know. So he does the words and it's all sex. And I go, it's a perfect, couldn't be better. I go and what's beautiful about it? It's not filthy, it's just sexual. And that's a great thing coming from a 21 year old because what should you be talking about?

Speaker 1:          00:46:23       Right. You know what I mean? Until you know about, so, but I'm saying this guy, I got to meet my son's, hang with my son's, hang with Valerie, hang with the eleanor, you know, so he got to talk to me. Just one on one is a human being and then fdcs me on stage in Vegas. It's like, why would you do that? Now, who's dice? Who's Angela Eggo? I been, I been, I'm sorry I ever took that name on, you know, because it's like, it's the same guy I am from Brooklyn. I do have an attitude. I do smoke cigarettes, you know, but I don't walk around my house, you know, a Grandpa, my dick go take that. You know, it's a joke. It's all a fucking joke. It's, I don't want to get mad. It's too early on the day. I don't get real mad, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:47:11       But you know the TV show now dice, it's, it is a hybrid. You get to see different sides of of who I am. So they, but they tried to say now, now that you're doing these big movies and you're doing tv shows, like you're on that vinyl show too, right? You get all these legit acting gigs and these legit acting gigs. They're thinking, why would you go back to what you do best and what everybody loves you from? Because I never stopped doing how, but think about how crazy that is it people who love you for this and Robin Williams, continuous standup career. Then Richard Pryor, continuous standup Korea took a long time off, but even Eddie Murphy did the stand up till till whatever happened to it. But even when he started doing the big movies, he was still doing concert films as stand up. What's wrong with and doing your first love?

Speaker 1:          00:47:59       Well, not only that, what's wrong with doing it when you know that's what people want to see it. It's just bizarre that I load doing it. They would decide that this is the movie things more legit. You know? It's like what everybody's really going for. Well, you know, I'm a movie star. I love acting. I've always loved acting. That's why I even got on stage as a comic because I didn't want to go to acting school once a week. I want it every day training. So I put together the act that you brought up earlier with Jerry Lewis into Travolta and I took that all the way up to doing Don Kirshner is rock concert. And after that I was thinking, well you know, at that time a lot of directors would come in to the comedy store. As a matter of fact, uh, the first movie I didn't get but I got close to was the movie diner.

Speaker 1:          00:48:49       You know, that Barry Levinson directed. And he saw me at that. But now I was on stage being dicey. So this guy flies me to New York. He puts me in a school to learn the Boston accent with a teacher and I was killing with the pot and I obviously I didn't get it in the end, but that's why beyond at the comedy store, cause I just wanted to hone acting chops. And then I finally did get, you know, Michael Mann when he did crime story, which was thrilling to me, you know, to be in a show with guys, Kevin Spacey, David Caruso. Um, you were fucking great crime story in your mouth, piece of Gum. Why we threw another one and not the one on one. You got to loosen up the stress. You gotta pop another stock. They, the actors that were on that show, you know, that was Dennis Farina.

Speaker 1:          00:49:47       That was Tony Denison. But you know, when you're working with guys like Kevin Spacey who was already starting to get known and you know, just everybody was Michael Madsen, you know, just Ted Levine, you know that. Well, the Buffalo Bill, you know, he's done a million movies, but the most famous is, you know, uh, clarice, whatever the fuck it, I'm told me that story about how you got crime story and that's everything I do on an audition now where the camera was rolling. Yeah. They called you while you were rascals and told you you got it. Got It. What happened is, I got it five months later. What happened? I went to read for Bonnie Timmermann, you know, and I figured Michael Mann would be there, you know, like you know, watching, but he's not there and she's just filming it. So I get mad at Michael. So I start talking into the camera cause I was reading for the gangsters, right?

Speaker 1:          00:50:38       Yeah. And I'm like, oh, so you're a tough guy. You don't have to show up for fucking audition. What's your problem? I'm not big enough for you to sit in an office and watch. Okay. So after three days and not hearing anything, he figured, all right, I didn't get this part. Five months later I was visiting in New York and my mother's waking me up going, you raging called three times already from William monitors. So you've got to call back. You know, it's like call her up and I'm having coffee with my mother, but what I'm hearing in the phone, I like can't believe she goes, you got booked on the show. Crime story, five seasons, you know, and this is what the pay is. I think the pace started me at like 2,500 and episode guaranteed seven at a 13 abc, you know, and I'm gone and I'm looking at my much everything, right.

Speaker 1:          00:51:27       You know, is everything okay? And I hang up, I go, I just got to a TV series. I got to go to Chicago Sunday night, NBC. Oh, was it all right, I'm from Miami, I'm a fucking vice. Are you kidding me? Who does that was not so, so it was paying off the acting, you know? And then I did the movie casual sex near the end of that, and then the Rodney Special Ed and that was it. I still remember Joe Rogan being in the motherfucking halfway house and I had furloughs and they said to me, the new rule is you can't go out on New Year's Eve. He would if you have furloughs. So they had conference rooms at the halfway house. And I said, let me ask you guys a question. What can I do on the conference from New Jersey? And they said, nothing. I go, what if I fucking rent it?

Speaker 1:          00:52:18       You can rent it. What do you want to offer? A second or 100 bucks. I want the air conditioner on all fucking night cause they always turn the air conditioner off. I fucking put the air on. I brought, there was a TV in there and I rented a VCR and I told all the inmates, I go, what do you guys want to do is sit in your fucking room so he could watch this comedian Andrew dice. Then nobody knew who he was. Nobody knew who he was. And that threw the fucking, uh, vhs. And, and I, that's what I did for New Year's Eve. And at that moment I knew I got to do this. Yeah. He said, told me when, he said, when I first met you, would you like to buy a flower for the lady? And he goes, yeah, so I could plant it in your ass. I was crying, not from funny. I was crying because I had those thoughts. This was the boys that was living in my head when I walked around and I saw somebody and people are like, oh, look at that lady's dress. And I'm like, she's a fucking dirty fucking content. You know what I'm saying? But that's the voice I had in my head. So when I watched dice, he says, it's a beautiful poetic thing. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:53:24       you have voice will have my daughter. She's fucking idea the voices. I was living in boulder amongst gentiles, which slippers that thought the world was beautiful. And I'm in the back of my head. I had this inner voice that would always look at people and judge and go, look at this fucking Jamoke fucking birken socks. I bet his wife, his wife's a Vegan [inaudible] often a pussy when it begins, the Ph just smells like a carrot, like fucking grass. Cause they're vegans. The Ph is off. So I was sitting there and since I would say all of these dirty things in my mind, so the first time I saw you at that halfway house, I know I got to do this, try it. Because this guy he's doing me, this guy's doing the guy that's living in my head. This was who he was. To know that thing about coming to know about all the inmates around the country.

Speaker 1:          00:54:16       Well, if there's more inmates like Joey, we just got to figure out how to get them out common. Where, I remember when I met Joey and he goes, you know the back steps like, oh he goes, I'm here cause see you. That's why I'm doing this. That's a compliment to me. You know? It's like wow. Yeah, all bullshit aside. You were at the front of the line for free speech for Comedians. You know Pete, they can, people can decide whatever. They know it's offensive or no, it's this. No it's not. At the end of the day it's a kind of art and you might not like it, but I'm not asking you to go listen to gangster rap either. You listen, whatever the fuck you want to listen to God. I'm not saying you should go see Ya, a mob movie and watch a hundred people get shot up, but if you want to do that, you should be allowed to do that and somebody should be allowed to make them, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:55:02       Well, I've been getting a lot of cool people coming to see me lately. Eh, in, in Vegas. I mean it's like people, I look up to that I liked that music like have come way around. Like this past weekend, pit bull came with his whole, his whole show for 20 people to shop. And this guy sitting at Tommy dice, he goes, I was watching you before you made it. Cause I did like certain tapes that were out there, like a with Redd Foxx. And he goes, I was watching you. And he knew when in 87 and Rodney wasn't till 88. He goes, I saw you like before that, you know. So when they told me last night that taken me to see you and this is what they call him, Mr Worldwide. He's on, you know, this guy, you know, and like, it blows my mind, like the, the kind of people that he was seven years old watching me, you know, that's like crazy shit.

Speaker 1:          00:55:57       Um, uh, Bruno Mars a few weeks ago. I mean that's like a not and these are people I look up to that I loved that work. You know how many seats is that place? The laugh factor in Vegas. Oh it's small. It's three 40 and now you know, I'll come back there in April and then in May that that putting me in the big showroom but I, I told Harry Bazell I said, you know, I'll go on the big show room for that night. I don't care. I'd rather work three nights for the same money in the small room that they can get more money in the big room. I go because I love being on top of the people. I'm not out. I mean there were certain big things that that are not coming my way. There is talk about going into the garden in September again because I sort of owe that to myself and the fans, you know, because things have built to this crescendo again.

Speaker 1:          00:56:49       So it's like why not? And plus my sons could be there and see it all come down. And that's thrilling for me because my field, the reason they're doing really well now is because I teach them by example how to go after something. And about eight years ago when I had to start gambling again just to pay my mortgage, you know, I would tell my sons going to start gambling to pay your mortgage. Yeah. Because I just wasn't making enough money and the gigs, you know, so I quit gambling for 10 years and gambling a blackjack or you just really good. All right, well I had 30 grand. Long Story Short, I turned it into 1,000,001 50 in a couple days. Okay. And I only play alone. That's how I play blackjack. And you know, I was nice enough to give a lot of it back, you know, over time.

Speaker 1:          00:57:41       And, but that's what gambling is. But through these last few years of building up again, you know, trust me, woody Allen didn't go, I want, I want you in my movie, here's a couple million dollars. It doesn't work like that, you know? But it was an honor to do a movie for him. So I still had to do to gambling and I ended the gambling with getting all the money for them to record their album because, you know, it's still not ridiculous. Vegas, I'm paying back taxes, I'm taking care of things that take a few years to take care of. But I also knew rock and roll was coming, you know, wood, vinyl and roadies and guns and roses back together and now jethro tall and all these great rock bands are coming back. So I wanted my boys prepared. So I gambled until I got every dime I needed for them to record.

Speaker 1:          00:58:35       Like I would call dillon from Vegas and go book another week in the studio. It's handled, you know, and then I stopped, you know, just done. You know how I am now. I am doing well again. I'm doing concert tours. It's happening now. How long did you in before? Um, well, uh, this last run was about eight years. That is hilarious. So you, but you did it profitable? Yeah, I would lose like any gambling, see my, and they show gambling in dice the show, you know, cause it's a hybrid of my life. But, but the, you use that as a strategy to figure out how to make money. That's hilarious. You know what, you know when my back's against the wall, look at him over there. When my back is against the wall, you know, the bottom line is I'm always going to take care of my family.

Speaker 1:          00:59:19       That's the way it is. And I do what I have to do, you know, to handle those things, you know? So I mean, you know, Bruce over here would say, I don't gamble this, that, you know, but you know, we, you know, I've helped him out. I help everybody out that needed the help when we needed it and now we're doing good. So I just stopped. That's just a crazy thing to plan on, to like to try to make money by gambling. You know, the bottom line is when you sit down to, again, number one, I only play alone with a, with a dealer, and you only play blackjack and only black jazzes, you and the dealer. That's it. Whatever you put up in front of you, the only way to win. Did you gotta be willing to lose every penny in front of you with no fear to beat them.

Speaker 1:          01:00:03       And a lot of the times I won and a lot of times I'd walk outlet, not winning, but it, it's nothing I recommend, you know, just like a performer, I had a certain feel for it, you know, I mean, I could walk into a casino, you know, I mean years ago I'd play, you know, half a million at a clip. You know, that was years ago when I was doing like the arena shows and that was just like a half million dollars a night. I could win or lose a half, a million and a half hour, you know, that was a day I lost a half a million by noon and by five in the afternoon, I want it all back. Plus another 55,000 oh my. It was plays like that, but now it was more about win 10 grand, which to me is pretty simple to do, you know, because I'm so used to playing gigantic figures from years ago.

Speaker 1:          01:00:52       So if I lose, if I sit down at a table with five grand and I'm down 2,500, I'm not going to sweat that because I know I could get that back in 30 seconds. You know, most of the time I would, you know, so you wouldn't 10 grand. You call your kids, you go book the studio. Let's get it done. So we just try another one down. No, no, no. I gotta go. I wish you a lot of luck. I'll be there cheering for you on the tonight show and I'm, you know, I love you got the reason I'm here. Thank you for being here. Mazal Tov you bought today for lunch. All right. Walk at 12 o'clock. Jamie, you want to say thank you to the Joe Rogan? Where are you at this week? I'm embryo. So, uh, I'm in Boston doing the wilbur Friday and Saturday night. I don't want to make this short, but I got to do interviews. I can sit with you. We've done we out. We could do it again anytime. I have to come here anytime. You're the better bass, Joe. Thank you again for me. It's an honor for real dog dice the TV show. Give me a pound. Get a best pounding. All right. See you soon.

Speaker 1:          01:01:56       That was great. Another great, it's always great with him. Yeah, it was fine.
