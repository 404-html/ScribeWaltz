Speaker 1:          00:00:16       Bad motherfucker. George is just a bad motherfucker and that's what makes him so good old school. Brian, Greg, his little bad mother fucker plants makes him famous. No, text me running up a little goes bad when he's got my gamble at lunch or something like the class clown pulling daughter. It's hard to see no door knocking on your door and little speck. No, I was still shooting. I sold nothing. Dot. I was doing candy up the corner. That's all I got my ass when I was 10 years old doing dumb shit. You got to have some sort of a, a clean cutoff point. Brian.

Speaker 2:          00:01:49       We should program that into the beginning of the first song or first a part of the podcast. I got clean cut off with no music because we could probably get in trouble for using people's music. That was ice cube doing dumb shit you it could be by on the iTunes. That's where I got it. It's possible. Brian Count. Brian Callen, Liza fresh from Thailand. Ladies and gentleman, freshman towers. I played the trumpet by the way. I just was thinking about that. I should have taken an instrument. Ours, our podcast is always a sponsored by the flashlight. And if you go to Joe rogan.net, there's a link. You Click on it and if you enter in the code Rogan, you can masturbate at a discount. That's fucking awesome. You ever blast went into one of these things? Uh, uh, that's a sin. Anyway, Brian, Brian, play in it clean now that he's doing films.

Speaker 2:          00:02:37       Your film just got to watch the image. It's funny when you do look at your films for those of you guys don't know. I think I just came back from Thailand doing hangover two little movie. But uh, but it's funny because when you, and we talked about this man, like you'd finally do the big film. You know, you're doing this big film and stuff and, and you know it, it's like you're your whole, like your desire is to do something that you've always watched. You want to be the guy with the sweaty shirt, with a gun, tears coming down your face on a railroad track with the wind blowing your hair back. And it's the final confrontation. We can have the shootout. That scene, that scene in your fantasy takes six days cause they're shooting half a page a day. That's what acting in the film as you're just sitting around while they spray your shirt.

Speaker 2:          00:03:17       Well as the sweat isn't really working, it's not the same as the shock before. We've got to change your shirt. Give us a minute. That light's not working. We've got, can you stand to the left a little bit bro. That's what, that's what do on a big film is really about. It's fun though because he ended up hanging out with some fun people on this. Generally complain about doing big movies. Dude, I want to hear that shit. Sorry. Uh, erase sucks now. I didn't, it didn't suck. I had a great time. What's the best Gig in Hollywood? Do you think it's a TV show? Well the best Gig for, for like as far as like comfort, life, comfort. That's what they said. I think there's no question that it's a sitcom cause you work 10 minutes a week and yeah, and, and you make a fortune.

Speaker 2:          00:03:59       See for me doing a doing a sitcom is, is uh, is cake because then I can go do stand up on the weekends and make you know, TV money doing that. Yeah. I mean the best Gig in Hollywood, the best Gig in the show business is, is either being a rock star or be in a standup comic. And I'm not sure what beats what, but you know, there's nothing like doing stand up. Stars can break up. The problem is they have to rely on a bunch of other that's exactly right. And, and I think also, you know when you're, when you were like a major rock star, you've been singing the same song for 30 years. That's got to get a little tire. Yeah. It's gotta be a weird, cause it's totally reverse of comedians. Cause with rock stars, nobody ever wants to hear their new shit.

Speaker 2:          00:04:36       You know, nobody wants to hear the new rolling stones songs. No, no, no. They're like, stop, stop. Do that. Start me up song again. Would comedy people don't want to hear old shit. They want to hear some new shit. What's some new shit to magic trick because it's, it's like you got to surprise him. That's when people laugh. They're constantly could be coming up with new material, but isn't that a funny thing? It's like the Rock Stars get pigeonholed into doing all their best old creation and we, we have to. That's why David Lee Roth, when he got, when they fired him from van Halen, he goes, oh, I know Sammy Hagar has got to sing jump for the next 20 years.

Speaker 2:          00:05:10       That's the problem with rock stars about, I'm not saying that it wouldn't be awesome to be a rock star, but you have to find a group of people who agree to hang out and be cool with each other in the midst of like the biggest ego explosion in humanity's history. Rockstar. Oh, forget it. But that's the bit, that's the top of the food chain. There's the top of the vagina food chain he had. There's no doubt. Fuck yet is, are you kidding me? It's not. To me. It's not, I wouldn't have gone awry or rock paper, scissors over everyone you've ever met in your fucking life. Even when he's a rock star with that huge head, it doesn't matter. That doesn't matter. He's got that. He's got the jobs are rock stars. Everyone knows he's banging everybody and it doesn't matter. It's not even them town.

Speaker 2:          00:05:50       He's the Alpha male fucking savage. Why? Cause he's a rockstar son. Singing songs that make them emotionally satisfied. These making them orgasm emotionally, saying all the right shit with the right tone, the right amount of sensitivity. Amazing what guys will do to get checks. How as a player of epic proportions, truly respect. Did he show? He shows up. He shows up in a black tight tank top. He's the only guy I can get away with that. How is he black? Top tank top. What champion? I'd get punched in the face, but John Mayer plays guitar and girls swoon. My man is just swinging Dick and given out bubble gum. Have you seen him do comedy? It's also about six four I think too. I Hate Everest guy. Handsome Brian. If you seen it to comedy, he's done comedy at the comedy store. I've heard he's done comedy as well.

Speaker 2:          00:06:37       Yeah, I can't. Yeah. Some guys, look, there's a pecking order, you know, I'm the best silver back. That's all there is to it. I'm in the tree thrown fruit while he's taken all my girls. Speaking of which all I could think of when I saw this video was you the the, have you seen those videos of the heartbeat eagles and Venezuela? Oh yes I have. Holy Sean's a take goats. Yeah. And that let it drop forever. No, the Harpy Eagles do that. But the big thing they do is get monkeys, monkeys and sloths. Venezuela basically fucking kill anything. They're the biggest ego. The biggest legal there are enormous. And this is, there's a documentary on Youtube. It is the shit. And I've thought of you immediately cause you and I are both retards when it comes to animal. He never had more too. If you heard about his fucking lions, we never had these conversations with anybody more than with you because you and I just sync up.

Speaker 2:          00:07:28       We both kick it to the next level of retard. I can't get enough. I can't get an that guy cause cause that, that you remember the conversation we had about those lions, the super lines in Africa that heat the water buffalo. Yeah, the giant lines talking about Brown because, and I were in like retard fever pitch right there. Well they used to always think of males. The females are bigger than males. They're chunking muscle lions both like holy fuck, this is fucking insane. And you just get, so that's why, that's why I got so obsessed with those champs, those huge 400 pounds champs, those lion eater chess. They found leopard meet in their faces. What? Oh and by the way, they how? Apparently and they fished with their own bare hands and they are all gray. You know that. No, I did not know that.

Speaker 2:          00:08:14       Great chimps. The older ones, they're gray. Look, let's just like in that movie Congo and let me explain something to you. When you buy a champ for anybody who wants to buy a champion, I one call. Here's the problem. You don't, you don't want something with seven times the upper body strength of a grown man with a three year old's brain. It's prone to rage. Okay. Cause they go for the face and the genitals. Yeah. Yeah. That's what they do. They, the guy at the San Diego Zoo go, no. A chimp says solve everything with violence. They go for the, the face and the genitals cause they don't want you to breathe. So they're, they're pretty vindictive. That's great. They really are like a, it's like a 500 pound man. Right. That's what they say. Well let me, let me give you an example. They took 140 pound female in the Bronx Zoo.

Speaker 2:          00:08:54       A long time. 140 pounds. Okay. Now MailChimp's get up to about 200 pounds is 140 pound female adolescent. They taught her that the more she pulled with one hand, they strapped her to a chair, the more she pulled with one hand the she had the sweeter or the fruit that give her, it's supposed to at an apple, they give our mango, she pulled 1200 pounds with one hand. She rode 1200 pounds with one hand. Now think about that for a second. Do To who are doing the upright row with three 50 they're crazy. They're monsters. They're huge. 1200 pounds. Her, her tensile strength, they did a tensile strength. And whether it's, did they test your grip? So the 160 pound man has, I'm a hundred and God, what was it? It was like 300 pounds or four, actually a 200 pounds of tensile strength. She had 1200 pounds of tensile strength strength as well.

Speaker 2:          00:09:38       She could squeeze, you know, a ball. I don't know. We are so fucking weak policies or such. I was less, she would fight with Shitty pussies. I spent three weeks in Indonesia rehabilitating orangutans. Okay. I was around, I'm sorry. It's pronounced orangutan to hear a fucking really smart you guys. Holy Shit. Personal. The forest in Indonesia. You guys learn a lot. This is about education. Show Tony about the education. Yo. Yeah, but meanwhile they're ridiculously strong. That's insane man. It's crazy. Back to Bangkok and that's 140 pound female. Uh, correct. So a 200 pound male fucking chart. How about a 400 pound male other than the huge ones? That's why they call him lion killers. Correct. The, the, the, the most recent expeditions actually caught one eating a leopard. They don't know if it killed it, but they observed them eating it and they're very elusive man.

Speaker 2:          00:10:32       They've actually never, I guess they've only seen like a couple in the wild. Yeah, they've only seen a few in the wild and they sleep on the ground. They nest on the ground just like gorillas. Who wouldn't, they don't give a fuck. Exactly. Good luck everybody. It's crazy cause it's only a very, very small part of the Congo and that, that part is all filled with civil war right now. It's very dangerous. So it's really hard to explore these guys and to get to them, you got to go straight through rain forest on foot. It's solely penetrable. Penetrable it's insane. And once you're in there, man, dude, good fucking luck. Good luck with poisonous spiders. Insects you out from the ear out. They will climb into your ears and eat your fucking brains. Millions of them. Streams of Ai. It's got to feel good. Elephants, man.

Speaker 2:          00:11:17       Have you heard of the spiders that are like that big that are over in like a rack right now that can't like camel spiders. I've seen him. I lived in Saudi Arabia. People those on fear factor. That's fucked up though. So they eat. I'm like, no, don't say biking numbs you. Well I would never be on that show. You got to grab them the right way. Hazing what people do for like the aim. I lead a camel spider and gets stung in my face. Yeah, getting stung on the, on the roof of my mouth can't be weak. There was a lot of shit we did with bugs. It was ridiculous. Scorpions with made people lie and a thing is corporate and just get jacked by Scorpions and they got to Tom and stuff. Yeah. Oh

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       yeah. Those big black ones that were really scary. Those are apparently are not as dangerous. Really dangerous ones with the small brown ones. Some of the small brown ones, but the big black ones, it's like a bee sting. What were those fluorescent ones? They were like green caterpillars that just burst every time you meet somebody would chew on them. Like they're Lewis, huge tomato hornworms. Those things are crazy. Fluorescent Green and it's so, if you're really trippy here in the wild, if you're in the wild, is there any bug you can't eat? Is there? I'm sure there's a lot of them. The one when bugs are really bright, bright, and colorful most of the time. That's a big warning. Yeah. It's a big warning that there's some poison in this motherfucker. Like, you know, look at this bitch pet back the fuck up. Yeah, you don't see me.

Speaker 3:          00:12:36       It's both of us. There's suicide bombers. You eat them and that's really what it is, is to discourage predation. Nature's porn star. You don't want to eat caterpillars. Apparently. Those are those. They're really bright and pretty, or Hornets, caterpillars, my whole, all those fucking things were just so lucky. They're small. Fuck, won't you imagine if Hornets were giant like a horse? It was a size of a fucking horse dude. You alluded him. Never evolved to this point. I guess they would just come down and just Jack, you bite your fucking head off and eat your body. Yeah, they did. They would just do that. It would just do that and would be nothing you can do about it. It never developed to the point where if, if those animals existed, let's, we learned how to ride them. No. Are we high rate? We're just going to be fine as fuck.

Speaker 3:          00:13:20       If it wasn't for that Goddamn asteroid that killed all the dinosaurs, do it. It never, we would never have gotten to this position. We had to start from scratch and then have a, a new race with the mammals. I tried to get to the top of the food chain. If there was giant flying fucking hornets, the size of horses, we would've never made it this far. I don't know. You'd have to go walk around with a flame thrower. I don't know if that would work. I don't know if that works on a regular morning. Those things are no joke. Yeah man. They would find that you, if they find you like in a a big fucking swarm of them found you. They found out where the people are. You ever watched that video there, these gigantic Hornets and the Japanese? Do you want to do mine? I don't want to go into that 50 times fucking you might have, I mean the sixth Japanese, Yellow Hornets, they're the biggest member of the Horn of family that came in and killed 30,000 bees in a period of three hours.

Speaker 3:          00:14:04       Is that what you mean? That video heads off ladies and gents already thousand bees. It would would be the youtube search for that Japanese Hornets Kisco. He'll go to go to hornets versus B versus B. As you gotta see this, and imagine if they were big and by the way, these things, they have close up on this thing and you watch these bees doing whatever they can. And the only time, this is what it was so creepy, those Japanese worn, it's what they'll do is they'll send a scout out and when the scouts sees the hive it drops like a hormone, like a, like a scent trail on the hive and then goes flying back to its, you know its nest and then, and then, and then the troops come out and they come out and then they just, they just eat the bees, how, what they do. But sometimes what the bees get, they get lucky. And what they'll do sometimes is they will actually,

Speaker 2:          00:14:51       when they get, when the Hornets walking around like it's doing right now, sometimes the bees will jump on it and they can't sting it cause it's too, it's a armors too thick. What they do is they start flapping their wings around it and they create so much heat around the horn at that the horn, it dies because it's too hot. And that's the only time if you can kill the scout before he goes back, your, your, your colony will survive. If you don't, then you're all dead. Holy Shit. Yeah. Look how big, how big it is. You have to see this spaceship and just wrap your head around what the fuck's going on. We, I think we discount the insane complexity of the insect world because there's so little. That's right. But if they were big, yeah. Well, buck a trip, this would be, they're, they're sold incredibly organized.

Speaker 2:          00:15:37       It's ridiculous. We're just so lucky. They're little. The defenders greatly outnumbered the Hornets. It could have easily yet turned out that these things were birds, you know, giant birds. Well did they tear doctors and things? We had the dinosaurs were essentially the birds have their closest relatives. They set us. So there's an interesting theory that I've read recently about dinosaurs that they believe that the size of dinosaurs is so ineffective given our current, uh, atmosphere that they think that it's possibly evidence that there was a different atmosphere on earth when a different like dogs density to the atmosphere on earth and they were cold blooded. It would probably have to be warmer than it was. Right. You know? Um, like crocodiles, I mean if you, you need to see that documentary called, there'll be here be dragons where you got those crops that actually bite a Willdabeast around the mid section and take a man fucking video when they're within the Willdabeast walks up to the palm there drinking and it just explodes out of the pond.

Speaker 2:          00:16:34       That's right. And that, that's a, that's a, I don't know how many thousands of pounds, but that, that is, that's a dinosaur. That's as close to a dinosaur as you get. It's incredible that that thing is still alive. They keep living and by the way, they keep growing. There's this condition with a reptile like that where they will just keep growing more. They get bigger, they get where they eat cows and there's a certain sinister quality to the crocodile that makes it look more sinister than an alligator even, you know, it's, it's called a longer, sharper snout and alligators have that got that round kind of rounder snout and they tend to eat fish and smaller animals too, but they fucking eat people and only pay him to, the guy got killed who was a on a running from the cops. He crashed. His car is like a Dui in Florida.

Speaker 2:          00:17:18       Really? Running from the cops, jumped out of his car, jumps into the water just as he jumps into the wall and the alligator grabs him and fucks him up right in front of the car. Is that true? Yeah. I was in the, I was in Marco Island doing standup and there's an area in Marco island off of Naples that has the biggest saltwater crocodile preserve American crocodiles. And there are signs all over. Don't go swimming. Do not get out of your boat. Don't be careful when you're fishing. All that stuff. It their crocodiles anywhere in the area. I'm not, Oh shit.

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       No, no. We're not going hiking. Well all you have to do is tap them on the snout and they're walking with it the fuck out of here. Fucking time. That's the, that's the biggest lie when I talk about when a, when a shark attacks, you hit him in the nose, they kill sea lines with their mouths tried. It's like hitting the Chevy on that on, on the mouth when it's coming at you at 30 miles an hour. And on the hood of the, on the hood, they're not worried about stuff that bumps their nose. They're going to fuck you up. That's just some bribes. That's great rights. What? That guy that rides great whites. It's a guy who, Brian's great wines from South Africa who he was snorkeling with eight great whites in the water and then wrote a 22 footer shut the fun. Speaking of which David Blaine fucking, I don't know if I can say this cause he, I think it's going to be part of a show, but um, he does a thing with the great whites is pretty crazy to do.

Speaker 3:          00:18:35       You just give it away. I can't even believe you did, but it's not, it's nothing. It wasn't it you, I'm not giving anything away, but he does something. He showed me some pretty cool stuff. I'll drop big names on this podcast if I want the whole animal world, man, we so take it for granted because we've pretty much isolated ourselves from it with cities. And you know, that's the first thing that really struck me when I was living in Colorado. Who was hell, you're connected to the wild world there on your, you cannot remove the wild world from Colorado. Like when you're driving through town in Evergreen, there's these photos of, uh, like elk herds that w Mosey through town, hundreds of elk thousand pound wild animals, wild cattle basically. Right? That's what they're like. And they're moving through the fucking forest and walking down the mainstream, clogging up traffic.

Speaker 3:          00:19:19       I mean, it's a trip. I was in Ohio one time, I was swimming and uh, um, I watched these poor purposes like I could, I could not, I could hear them because they were probably 50 feet away and they just passed me. Not Dolphins, but those huge purple porpoises just and one I'm surface and breathe through. It's a, and I just felt so insignificant. It was like a locomotive, like it just a bunch of locomotives just gliding through. It was crazy. So I called to them, I'll do the trip about dolphins is that they're so intelligent and they, and they have wars with each other and you can see it when you're, you're looking at them. There's like there's some weird connection when you're, when you're communicating with a dolphin, when you look, if you're buy a boat and they're jumping up and looking at you like when they're trying to play with you and have fun with you, like one there's like you, you connecting to them somehow or another cause like I think what's interesting about the more intelligent the animal, for example, chimpanzees, even even certain birds but especially dolphins, the more organized and more violent they are with each other.

Speaker 3:          00:20:23       Like a dolphins will wage war on other door, Dolphin pods and kill entire pods. And they didn't know that until they created this documentary on it where they actually have they sent out like warring parties. It's exactly like chimps. If chimps have one area of a forest and there's another family of chimps and another area, they'll send mails out that we'll look for other males when the other and kill him.

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       It's crazy. Yeah. We're not the only ones that do Warren animal kick. Not at all. Not at all. That's why I've always said to people, man, you gotta be really careful about wanting the fucking aliens to land. Just look at the history of what every smart thing has done to everything. Not as smart all over earth. Every single opportunity nature has had to express itself. The, the stronger, smarter things. Fuck the weaker thing.

Speaker 5:          00:21:13       That's the argument against technology in some ways for a lot of computer scientists, when you start creating computers that are smarter than we are and they start making computers smarter than they are, which is, and then they'd start developing what's called will, uh, that the question is, are they going to have a respect for the biological heritage?

Speaker 4:          00:21:28       Yeah. I mean, look all over. The what? The intelligent animals that we know. Chimpanzees eat monkeys. All right. Killer whales eat dolphins. They kill and eat dolphins, man, and we do whatever the fuck we want to do to everything underneath us. Why would it, what are we expecting the aliens to be so evolved that they're past the whole rule of nature that expresses itself over and over again wherever we are. Everything that's intelligent takes advantage of everything that's not as intelligent. Absolutely. It's just the way it was. Not as strong or not as power and human beings do it to other human beings. It. Dot. Yeah. You know, why wouldn't we expect the aliens to just be coming down here and just fuck with us? I think it's a will to power. I think it exists. I don't know. I'll be ready. Brian, what would you do if the aliens landed? What would you do if it all turned out to be real and that we have been monitored from space by invisible Aircrafts that

Speaker 6:          00:22:17       well, it depends what, how they come. Like if they just slowly land and go like, Hey, I'm an alien. I just landed, I would probably be like, hey, what's going on? You know? But if they just like blow up, it'd be funny if they were really, they were really had to come back to, hey guys, what's going on? Where the aliens Auntie, nothing will,

Speaker 4:          00:22:33       you know, they got to a point where they realized they had to step in because we were fucking up the resources of this world so bad that they had to reveal them

Speaker 6:          00:22:40       again. It would have to be their body language, you know? If they're like just coming up to me going like, hey, we're going to have to step in here. You guys are like, okay, I guess you could do I try it again. Try it out, go for it. I'd ask him to just think about jet travel. I'm going to take less time to travel across the country. You don't want it to take less time. It's good right now. It's only a day, dude. Relax everybody. Let's not fucking start teleport in each other. Halfway from here to there. Thailand was like 27 hours. I don't know what that was. Was there like weird, like just things everywhere you went around there. Yeah. Bangkok's interests

Speaker 5:          00:23:13       saint because it's like this very, very, um, hot, hot tropical city with a lot of pollution and a lot of people, it's just chaos. But what's interesting, and if you're in the underage sex for 60 bucks, then you know, more power to you. But I'm not into that stuff or I am, but I feel so guilty. Uh, no, no. But I played, uh, you know, the owner of a strip club. So we shot a lot of those scenes in, in the sex district, the red light district, which is you play a new person and you were, yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:23:43       I mean, I, I'm wearing a wig. He and I, it's very

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       much the same. Anytime Phyllis loves that character. And I shouldn't say much more than that, but, but, um, it, it was so much fun, man. And I think, I really think it's gonna be hilarious. I think it's going to be just as funny as far as awesome. Yeah. I mean it was so, they just so went for it in every aspect. I think they're going to do the same with this man. I was so impressed with just watching the credits were fucking fast. God and Paul Giamatti is in reality. He's just hilarious. And he was the deal with that Chinese guy. That's not really his penis. I can CGI, you should have him on the podcast by the way. He's a great guy and he loves you. But I, I'm actually talked to him about you, but um, uh, that is, I'm not going to make a comment on that.

Speaker 3:          00:24:24       I'm not sure if that's his actual, I'm a big fan of him too and I, yeah, I've seen him talk about it that he, that really was, it was such a good guy. Is He? Oh, he's a great last one. He's a real doctor practitioner, a practicing doctor. Holy Shit in Calabasas, I think that's where it was. And he, he's, he's a straight up doctor and then started just taking acting classes and doing stand up and he's just hilarious and fearless and he just hasn't stopped working and he was so grateful for where he's at and he can't believe it. He's like, I keep all of this, but he's fearless man. He doesn't care. He'll take his clothes off. He's just, you know, just funny, funny, funny. So how did he, how did he break out of being a doctor? He was just like, I don't really like man a doctor that much.

Speaker 3:          00:25:09       When he was acting and doing all these movies, he was still, he had a practice. He was still doing like, you know, yeah, he's his wife as a practicing doctor to holy shit. How many people are like that? They just wanted to do something else with their, fucking never went for it. He said they got stuck when it turned it around that much. Most people, man, I know. And then a guy like that who actually says, I'm going to, you know what? Thanks a lot for medical school debt. I'm going to be an actor. You know, why? What are you talking about? You got to practice now I'm going to, I'm going to chuck this in and I'm going to become a movie star. He's good man. He'll be working forever. Forever. He's your go to guy for sure. He's hilarious. And he's really fun to work with.

Speaker 3:          00:25:47       That's the other thing I'm starting to, I was like the guys that work a lot like Giamatti and those guys, they're just really good people. Right? Just a blast. They just, they're just very giving, you know, they're just, they listened to you, they react to you. They just, they're, they're just happy to be there and not cynical about it. Kevin James, um, I did his movies, zookeeper and his whole staff, like everybody who was working on the movie is so friendly. Oh, they're great. Like so nice. And everyone is like really appreciative of everyone. It's just a nice fun working environment and it's like seamless because of that. And I'm Kevin's that way. Kevin's a regular guy comes, right? It all comes down from him, but it's like, it makes things so much better. You know, you really like when you're working with people that appreciate what's happening and appreciate what they're doing and appreciate each other, you know, fun, positive environment. It's called perspective. That's why reading like history, instead of being like, not talking about intellectual, but just getting a sense of what came before you

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       and how most people throughout all of history lived short, miserable lives, lives because they didn't have access to, I dunno, uh, antibiotics, vaccines, uh, cat scans, all the things that let us go beyond Abazi running water. I mean, it just goes on and on and so, you know, you'd lose three of you are like, Lincoln lost his kid to a fever. You know, how many, how many famous people have lost their children, three of their children at a time to, you know, things like diptheria and stuff we don't even, we haven't even heard of. And so when you have a perspective of how lucky you are as just somebody with WHO's never missed a meal, for example, or who are, doesn't have to do anything to get what they want, you know, just stay warm and stay safe and have representative government. There are, there's nothing to complain about.

Speaker 5:          00:27:26       Nothing man. Well, there's certainly something to complain about because got to evolve and get better. She can be satisfied with the way it is. That's what it's completely fucked up. I want to know about all this crazy wikileak shit. You know, it's uh, uh, the, the, the, yeah and, and the debate. Here's an interesting, well before you say anything, there's an interesting story that came up from the New York or rolling stone magazine said if the New York Times had received the same information, which is basically all wikileaks did, would, would we be prosecuting them? That's the fundamental question is this, you had a private who made all this information available and the private was in direct violation of military code that that when you, when you join the mill and take an oath and what that, that private could be tried for treason because what he did is he took sensitive information, not top secret but secret information and he let it end.

Speaker 5:          00:28:13       He just basically deliberately leaked it. Now I agree with Julian, Julian Assange, he, if it's proven in court, and this is probably going to be the defense, the defense is platform. If Julian Assan just said, look, I was given this information and I provided a platform for that information, not unlike the, and this is exactly what the New York Times did they provide. Now the New York Times, what they did was they actually, they actually edited out certain names of people that could be put into harm's way if it was found out that they were helping the enemy in those countries. So in other words, if the CIA has certain people we pay to get information, as soon as their names are put out on the Internet, they are, they can be, their lives can be a danger because the host country or the country that they belong to or that they're betraying or whatever, they would put them in jail or kill them or whatever it might be.

Speaker 5:          00:29:02       So, so that's where, that's where the dilemma really, because we're really comes when you just dump a bunch of information out, uh, it, it can have representation to the names of operatives. The New York Times did the wikileaks did know Julianne songs just took all that Info and just let it out really. So he let out names of operatives at different countries and he even gave, he even gave a social security numbers and addresses of soldiers and stuff like that. And the problem with that is that, you know, there's one side of the argument that says, look, there's got to be transparency and if you're, if you're an operative, if you work for the CIA, there's always that risk, you're going to be compromised. Okay, that's one idea. But the other issue is how, why we're all for transparency. I certainly am. I'm for transparency of government.

Speaker 5:          00:29:43       That's important. You don't want to give any, any agency in government too much power because like any human beings, just about natural human instincts, they just become their own gang and they get as much power. And that's what's the brilliance of the founding fathers was creating all different departments that are competing against each other. The State Department has their agenda and they're always trying to undermine the department of Defense. Department of Defense has its own problems with the executive and it just, and that's a beautiful thing because it, it, it doesn't let anybody have too much power. But, but at the end of the day, if you're going to take just a bunch of Info and just dump it in some ways I think it has, it's first of all, it's spiteful and I'm not sure what the point is. If you want transparency, that's one thing, but if you're going to be that irresponsible and put people's lives at stake who are trying to do a good word, personal information and they're trying to do good work out there.

Speaker 5:          00:30:29       You know, when I was in Afghanistan, those guys, most of those soldiers I was around were building hospitals and schools say what you will about the war and say we'll about the motives and things, but and, and there's an intelligent debate to be had about the United States and not getting involved in other countries affairs. We've heard these things, but the point becomes what are you trying to accomplish when you dump all that information out there and what one of the repercussions might very well be that government agencies have a tough time getting information from valuable sources overseas, whether it's in cases of espionage or whether it's case of national security. A lot of people now are going to go, I don't want to talk to you, dude, I talked to you and I might get leaked because you have no guarantee that you can keep these correspondence secret.

Speaker 5:          00:31:15       It's one thing to embarrass politicians. It's one thing that Vladimir Putin is called a guy who doesn't have as much control over as government. All right, we'll get over that diplomatically. It's another thing when very valuable sources of information for the United States all of a sudden are compromised. And then field operatives who are trying to make the world a safer place, all of a sudden have very tough time recruiting anybody because nobody wants people to, like I tell you a secret man and my name now is all of a sudden on, on, you know, uh, in the New York Times, no thanks. Or it's on, it's on the web and on a website and my, and the people that I'm betraying, that's the first thing. That's the first place they look and they come to my house and kill me and my family. Nah, sorry. Find another guy.

Speaker 5:          00:31:55       I'm not, I'm not working for you. So that, that, that that becomes an issue and there are a lot of other issues. I think that we haven't really even, we'll see what this, what this means, that these things take time. The ripple effect takes some time. Do you think that there's any way that the private, the guy who leaked the information, the guy who you know in effect, committed treason, does any way that you could argue that if he thought that there were agregious offenses that were being ignored and swept under the rug, that it would actually be unpatriotic to not report them? It's a very good question. It's a question that was raised with the Pentagon papers. It's a question where, when, when it's tricky, right? Well sometimes the, your government is saying that we're not bombing Cambodia and you start finding out that we're doing, we're doing exactly that in violation of it might be, you know, this is the whistleblower is a whistleblower at debate.

Speaker 5:          00:32:43       It all depends on whistleblowers always going to have to take responsibility for the fact that there are people in the government that needs to betrayed, that are going to call him a scumbag and tried to prosecute him. I do think, I think that's a very, very good question. I do think that sometimes you are in a position where you are privy to information that is either unjust, illegal or um, but there are channels, there are also channels and our government to go through. Uh, sometimes you think to yourself the press might be the last resort. There, there are other legal channels that the military provides. Um, and uh, it's a good question. Uh, it's a really good question, man. I do think that you have a responsibility as a human being when you see grave injustice. I don't think in this case that was the case.

Speaker 5:          00:33:25       I don't think this private, um, saw anything grossly injustice back. Do you think he's just, he just, it was impulsive. Like what do you, why do you think he did? Uh, you know, I fuck that's him. That's him. Let's ask him. Just ask him like hold or drinking coconut water. Listen, you don't want to give her a heads. See Two oh, coconut water. I love it. No, what is that? It's a really hard to find coconut water. I like that. It's clear there's a, there's a Amy and Brian's too that can be found on that. Why is this hard to find? I don't know. It's just really popular or it's just, it's 100% natural, new and tonics. Sorry about that. Ladies and gentlemen, we were in the middle of fascinating fucking conversations. Like God damn, phone has to ring. But that's a, that's a really good question.

Speaker 5:          00:34:13       And whenever, you know, um, you know, an institution of power, it's tricky, right? It's like, you know, look what is this this nation founded on the nation is founded on, here's a very good question. Here's a very good question. What does that founded on true? If we go back to 2003 and you had very, very good information that there were no weapons of mass destruction. For example, if you had top secret information that, um, that, that, for example, we've had, we have no evidence whatsoever that there are any weapons of mass destruction, yet an entire nation is being sold a bill of goods red. Let's just take that as an example. Okay. And you knew for sure, because by the way, in 2002, nobody had any idea. Nobody was really saying, even on the National Security Council, on the United Nations Security Council, nobody was saying Saddam Hussein didn't have weapons of mass destruction.

Speaker 5:          00:34:57       They were saying, where are they? That's what they were saying. We all assumed he had met in the weapons of mass destruction because he'd used them on the Kurds in the nineties poison gas, not just poison gas, but germ warfare as well. So we had, we had documented evidence and you're not, and, and the United States, United Nations corroborated this. It wasn't just US intelligence, but we had documented evidence that he had used and killed a large number of Kurdish men, women, and children with, with these horrible weapons. So, so in 2002, when you say, when, when Bush was saying, look, this guy has the fourth largest army in the world. Um, he's acted very responsibly. Started three wars, two with Iran, one with Kuwait, uh, which resulted in a million people, the dead on both sides. This guy miscalculates all the time. You tell me what's, what's to stop them from dropping a weapon of mass destruction into an enemy of ours? Hands anonymously, like okayed. Okay. It was a very, it was a, that was a, that was a debate that they talked about in the war room. Bush says, you know what? The guy's got weapons of mass destruction. Let's make a play. Let's, let's, let's bring it up in the, to the, to the United Nations and we're going to war. If this guy doesn't cough them up. Now let me ask you something. If you're,

Speaker 6:          00:36:07       what are, you talked about? What is going on?

Speaker 5:          00:36:13       Hold, please hold. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you're taking notes because I don't know what I'm talking about.

Speaker 6:          00:36:17       Story is haunted dude. Do you think coconut water is gonna become so big that they're just going to like, they're like coconuts are going to become rare, like we're going to eat all the coconuts off the planet? No, I don't because I don't think it's that popular. What if, because I mean is that something that we could run out?

Speaker 3:          00:36:34       I don't know what happened there folks. I have my volume turned off. There's obviously a fucking ghost in my house. Sit in the office late and gentlemen, the government, the government is letting me know I can turn up your volume anytime I want. It's the comedy store, abortions, ghosts, but he's traveling.

Speaker 5:          00:36:49       But here, here's the final point. Here's the point. The point and we'll move on is if you, if you were in a position and you work, you are a field operative. You are a CIA guy who were in a panic on and whatever and you knew for a fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction or at least there was no evidence. But to divulge that information would be to compromise certain national security secrets. Would you do it? My, my feeling would be that you should do it might be like feeling would be that if you're going to stop a war from happening cause there's no evidence, then maybe you should say something that you're a fucking George Clooney moves you guys.

Speaker 3:          00:37:23       You're a god Damn George Clooney movie. I don't have enough hair to be George fucking you can to to give you some shit. They put some stuff in. You know what? They dust my head. Bruce Willis, important way. Bruce was shaved his head. He doesn't give a fuck dude. You could do it man. This is the movie. This is the breakout hit gas less gentlemen. Your stop it. You're going to stop the war. He's the guy that talks too much. He's old. It's an alternate world, an alternate version of our life. If you had stopped the war, if you had known there was no weapons of mass instruction, you get on TV and you change the world, they believe you, and then it shows what we're really like now in 2010 or 1111 but it used to that. That's what's funny is if you had all the answers, you had all the secrets and how would, when people really listen to think you're an idiot.

Speaker 3:          00:38:05       Shut up stupid. Right? Well that's what Judah thought about Jesus, man. That's what they thought about Jesus. Unless you can provide produce miracles right there and then even then they're like, that's a trick. There's something fascinating about this. Looking back to a time when someone had it all fucking nailed, we've always done it. It's weird. It's nostalgia for the, what is that called, the good old days. Do you think that Dan is, because there's been a bunch of different versions of civilization that things have crashed and gotten terrible and then gotten better and crashing, gotten terrible,

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       so they've always looked back to when things were great before it crashed. It's like almost like an ethic. It's almost like the way we think, well, you know, like, uh, they were talking about it, uh, this, this fundamentalist Islamic movement. It's a very new thing in Islam and this, this extreme extremes who believed that, you know, they always look back when Mohammed created Islam and that was the golden age and it was where everything was perfect and stuff like that. And it just, I think that some, I maybe it's, I think sometimes people will know what started it. What started the, the most, the most extreme movement now? Well, a lot of it came from what they w hobby sect of Islam, which, uh, was in Saudi Arabia and continues to be in Saudi Arabia. It's a puritanical form of Islam. But, um, this is a long debate.

Speaker 5:          00:39:20       I don't want to say anything to you but, but I mean certainly I think one of the, one of the, one of the things that caused Islamic fundamentalism was I think, I think Islamic fundamentalism, like anything else, it's an idea that was, that was born out of a bunch of men who basically felt lost and insignificant and needed something to make themselves feel. Um, uh, I guess cohesive and important. And you know, whenever you look back in this, this is what I was trying to say about when you look back, usually when people look back on the good old days, I think it's a natural reaction. It's usually because you're connected to something that's trying to revive something. You're trying to revive something. And when you look back at, you know, whenever you talk about, well back in the day with Connie, here's with martial arts a lot back in the day those Kung Fu masters cause walk on water.

Speaker 5:          00:40:07       They could fly through the air. I think it's like kind of like before things were contaminated that when they first came out they were pure and throughout the ages they become compromised and contaminated. That's a human thing we do instead of realizing the things actually evolve and get better usually, uh, we, we like to look at like when things first came, when they were first born, if there's a purity to it and we got to get back to that purity because we've lost our way. And I think that's why people look back on history and kind of say, boy, back in the day when, when, when the mailman came and the Milkman came and it was just so great and you have to walk the streets without anybody killing you are murdering you and it's all, it's all a lie. It's all, it's all horse shit in my opinion.

Speaker 5:          00:40:50       It's all like, you know, looking back on the good old days when you know, things weren't so good, things are actually really inconvenient and really difficult. You didn't have things like, you know, the Internet and access to information immediately. Sure. It comes with its own problems. But we live for the most part. Most of us, even in the past 30 years, live a much better life. And I'll give you two examples. I mean, China and remember China was, was an Russia for that matter. And most of those countries couldn't, they couldn't leave their own country. Those were communist countries with very strong central authority. Is it controlled everything you did? Uh, Latin America was all military dictatorships. Now they're all democracies. So I mean, you know, when people look back on the old days, I'm always like, I dunno man. You know, you haven't been studying history too much because

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       it wasn't all the old days can suck my dick. Correct that correct. Even old cars suck. I like just an old car when I used to widdle. Yeah. An old car with a carburetor. It got like a block, a gallon at always broke down. They look awesome. They sound stupid. Right? They just so ridiculously dumb. The drive, and they were really, really dangerous. They didn't have airbags. I mean, you went through those windshields, man, you lost your head and those breaks were bunks on those breaks. Barely stopped those cars. Big stupid drum brakes in the back. We were just driving around in death machines right now we have abs brakes, we got computers, we got everything. It's amazing that people survived having those stupid cards didn't most of the time you had kids riding in the front seat with those lashed out fucking hey put on your lap belt everybody.

Speaker 3:          00:42:20       I'm in the backseat. I don't need my seat belt. And you're driving around in this huge rectangle of metal. Forget it. Barely loosely connected to stupid tires that are screeching around every corner and goes my transmission he cars, they would take a turn and you would hear their tire squeal cause they're barely hanging onto the road with this shitty pizza you get in an accident and all you got to run into is steel and glass. Not even, not even like, not even that crushed glass. It's just like that big shards of glass cars today are the defy physics. You know, don't really, but they feel like they do Ralph Nader. You can thank him for that. He was the spearhead for all that. Ralph Nader. That's not do for Shit. How about that? Ralph Nader was like, cars are dangerous and I'm going to do something about it. He, a lot of people got pissed off by that guy when he was running for president. I said that's, that sort of revealed who he really is.

Speaker 5:          00:43:10       Well, yeah, because he took away, he took votes. Crucial votes away from the Democrats though.

Speaker 3:          00:43:15       Yeah. There was that idea and there was also the idea that, well, what else? Who gives a fuck about politics? Politics. Motherfucker's saying the Ralph Nader is the one responsible for it all.

Speaker 5:          00:43:26       Well, Ralph Nader is, Ralph Nader was the guy who said, you know, these, these cars are, I think he started a thing called unsafe at any speed or something. And uh, I think that's what it was. I might be wrong, but Ralph Nader basically said, look, we've got a lot of people dying needlessly and it's ridiculous getting paralyzed and stuff because cars are not safe. They're dangerous. And there's a way we have the technology to make cars safer. You know, letting Mercedes Benz invented the airbag. Okay. Let told everybody.

Speaker 3:          00:43:54       So, so it's Brody Stevens. Was He over there? Yes, he was. Yes, he was late and gentlemen, Brody Stevens going crazy over there. Brody Stevens going crazy. Did he bring his dog?

Speaker 5:          00:44:04       Uh, he did not bring, the dog did not bring a stop, but I was going to say that I want to buy a Mercedes next because I found that Mercedes invented the airbag and gave it to every other car company. They gave it to them because they realized that was the moral and ethical thing to do.

Speaker 3:          00:44:19       So you're going to buy a Mercedes because of that or because you want to go big pimpin sons. I want to go big. Pimpin would you buy like one of those big sled like Mercedes or would you buy like the little two door? I want to be, I don't know, man. That's a good question.

Speaker 7:          00:44:32       Maybe I want to buy. I should fucking know what you want to buy something that drives well you give a fuck about that or do you think that when you don't care, how about safety for me now I want to try it out. Yeah. That's the best safety and comfort. Yeah. I like an SUV, so if somebody hits me, I'm not dying. They want to, I want a horse. I think horses are sexy. Talk to me about what I want. Plenty horse store this horses in my neighborhood near the dam. I'm driving and I swore to God, I'm not speeding. I am not even remotely spitting. I am a leisurely driving down the street and there's a lady in front of me with the horse and a, I'm nowhere near them. Okay, I'm hundred yards away and the horse starts freaking, just does a like a little freak move, like a little freak move and the fucking lady with the horse and her friend look at me and just start doing this thing.

Speaker 7:          00:45:25       Waking up and down and I swear to you, making the horse is more of, you're not even going 25 miles an hour. I'm not, I'm not even going so slow. I'm just relaxing. I'm just driving and this horse just sees a car coming and it starts bucking and these gigantic man like arms cause to everyone and women who are into horses. They're all the same. First of all, they're all blonde. They all have cinder block heads and they all have these squat football player bodies and they're fucking stupid boots, funniest leather boots that go up to their knees to fuck you shared there weren't going to like pimps up hoes down. She was mad at, I swear to God I was nowhere near this horse. If I had done a douchey thing, I'm a big fan of animals, but I'd done a douchey thing. I would, I would admit it. I put, it was ridiculous. It was just me driving and all of a sudden fund money.

Speaker 5:          00:46:24       Funniest horror story I just heard a couple of days ago, my buddy, what had they found this, he's fine now, but they found a benign tumor growing out of his spinal cord. He had back problems. She here so he's like, what's going on? And he's been, he was a pro athletes up and they went and they go, dude, you got to, you got a tumor growing out of your spine. He has since had it removed and it was a really successful operation and stopped by these team of really good time. But anyway, so he's, he's all bunched up. He's like a tumor in my day. Like, yeah, we have to take it out. It's very delicate procedure. You could have some paralysis and he's dealing with all this knee, doesn't know what to do. He's like, oh, this is terrible. So he's driving in Marina del Ray and he's down this alleyway and he's like kind of in a daze.

Speaker 5:          00:47:04       Like, what am I going to do? I've got to, this is crazy. Thank God I have health insurance, but I don't know what I'm going to do. They've got to cut into my spinal cord and he's just completely out of it. Out of nowhere, out of nowhere as he's like contemplating his own mortality, he just sees and these huge eyes and nostrils and this horse, this massive horse runs ed his car and he it on the slant. He's going really slow anyways down and now he stops the horse, jumps over his car, breaks the windshield, but Denzler does $3,000 worth of damage on his new car and then run runs

Speaker 2:          00:47:43       over the roof. Good, good, good, good, good, good. So if he does, he, he's good. Good, good.

Speaker 5:          00:47:48       She crushed and she'll run over as bar runs. It was a police horse that had gotten spooked. It got spooked by somebody who threw a firecracker and, and all of a sudden the horse ones and he sees like 16

Speaker 2:          00:48:01       cops like, oh come running around the corner and now they're running at him and he's like, what the fuck is going on? And they just do see the horse. He goes, look at my fucking car. And now he's like trying to get them to pay for his, you know, his basically his car is pretty fucking crazy that they're were and animals. Yeah. 2011 it's for crowd control. Come on. Why are you riding animals? Christmases in Lord of the Rings Brahms

Speaker 6:          00:48:23       everyday because I live in a question and district and so there's, this horse is coming over my patio like scaring my dog all the time. I mean I live in like horse world. It's crazy. I didn't get, how do you get on the mounted police? Is that a promotion or is that a demotion that you get made fun of by the other guys on the motorcycles and write for dudes? It's really uncomfortable for girls. Apparently riding horses can give you Oregon. You can blind it upright and listened. I had, I had sex with this. I had sex with this horse girl

Speaker 2:          00:48:50       in London. Tough Lips. Ah, it was good in the stable by the way. The smell of horses and leather and my Dick. Holy Shit, Alexei, smell that all together. I smelled the VA should offer a few of my ticks and I was like, Hey, and saddle, that ghost is living in my by Brian Calla. It sounds like, uh, sounds like a fucking Cologne. I said, dude, 50 cents. Got a quote and that's what you need. Horses. Smell that. You smell that Horse Hay and Dick. It's my new Cologne called Horse Hay Day. Hope you don't mind sponsoring. We spotted the Joe Rogan podcast. Might be the only Cologne I'd be willing to. Where you want to smile? You want to smell it? Horse. He would wear, I would wear that shit and I spell out there. My natural chimpanzee, I'd Spell Dick was three I's. Dig with a hyphen. Then at the end of it probably Jake gently touch the tip of your penis through your pants. Talking about dementia. That's my favorite,

Speaker 6:          00:49:53       you know, question district. I live in it. There's these people that have those little ponies and it's like, and I'm just like, who are these people that buy these minimum opponents? Prance around yet. Yet he's a little horse. It just walk around with, oh, they're show ponies. That's what they're really affectionate. Those little things and there are great, fuck, whoa. What? Hey, wait a minute. Hey, we've been through this before. Have you ever thought about getting one? Joe's what I'm asking because I've loved it. If you had a little show. No, there's a guy across the street from me that's got a horse stall. You can get one that's kind of a trip walk by his house and this is China animal in his yard. I love the ride. You ride them. They're just going

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       to be there, a pet them and they eat.

Speaker 4:          00:50:29       That's the weirdest thing. They just wander around. They don't do shit. If it's like dogs, I have a yard, dogs are, they're always out there playing and chasing a squirrel or something and it's like fill a cart. They're having a good time out there. But if you have a horse, they just stand there. It looked for something neat and just move. Move a little over here.

Speaker 2:          00:50:44       You could fuck them, Jo. Brian, you know you don't fuck courses. Did you watch the video we played yesterday? Horses. Fuck you pal. You know, fuck them. You are the conversation killer. My brother. The mouth can fuck you dude. There's some good, could you imagine sticking your Dick in a horse? Have you ever felt it? It's soft as an ass. Does fat like a baby's butt? Have you ever, it would be perfect. Yeah. You mean the lips? Yeah, those turpines says flat grass stain teeth got ahold of your, snapped it off it like a base. It likes carrots, tickets, teeth out. Oh, shut the fuck up bro. I be great. We could crush you just to bone. Even without teeth out teeth that would crush you. It was my mother got bitten by a horse. Okay. My mother got bit right. Right, right in the shoulder by a horse and the fun bit and she was like, it was the worst thing she'd ever had.

Speaker 2:          00:51:35       A what for what reason? Horses by you. If a horse doesn't like you or horses fearing scared of territorial, they'll bite you with those horse teeth and fuck you up. Correct. Oh, last time I was on a horses because I got bucked and I haven't been on one sentence and that was one of the most scariest things ever. Getting fucking a horse. It's freaking out and just bucking you off. Flying in the CROC or I'm riding since I grew up riding horses, I'm still scared of him. Fuck, fuck. Big giant animals that you ride since 2011 just stupid. I'm just kidding. I hate horses. That was the best, the best that my buddy, my buddy Bob, that that real tough dude. I always tell you about it. I went to him, I said, he does everything you need rides, bulls and stuff like that and I've seen him, I have video of him riding a bull lock, both knock both his teeth out and he was like, whatever stayed on it, stayed on in any way.

Speaker 2:          00:52:18       Didn't get off. He plays, he plays that poker thing where you play poker in a bowl. They let a bull out and the last guy to get up though, fuck plays that. He's always the last guy up. I have video of that. He's the last guy up. The other guys don't, everybody's like runs and he's like, he gets up casually like eh, whatever like that. And I said to him one time, I go, I go, can you a ride a horse? He looked at me, I guess I'll break a horse bro. I break old. Dead serious. Like he was insulted. I asked him if he could ride when he fucking break a wild horse. I know. How would you do that? He goes, I fucking ride it until it fucking listens to me. That's how I get, that's how I do that. I was like, you're a fucking bad ass

Speaker 4:          00:52:54       work. Well, the horse just gives up and becomes your,

Speaker 2:          00:52:56       now you have to break that. You break a horse on a line, you, you, you have it. You teach it at a run in a circle and you, you have it on a line.

Speaker 4:          00:53:04       So if they get a wild horse, they really can break a wild horse. If someone can, you could lasso a wild.

Speaker 2:          00:53:09       Yeah, but there's a technique to it. You have to unity have you don't get on it. At first you, you tether it, you tether it to a, like a mine and you and you and you teach it how to run. How does it not just stomp the fuck out of you? It does. A lot of times they will, but you got to, you have a whip and you keep them in. I mean, it's somebody who really knows what they're doing. You got to whip it. Did people still do that in this day and age? You still try to tame wild horses? Well, you have to break a horse. Wears a wild horse these days. Where are you finding no, I wouldn't find packs of wild horses and hang out with the trip courses are indigenous, I believe originally in the Gobi desert of um, of Nepal. I mean, I'm of a, of Mongolia.

Speaker 2:          00:53:47       So that's where horses, yeah, that would, that's where the wild asses came from and all that. So I believe that the, the original, the original horse, um, that's where they were originally, uh, from the steps of Asia. So did they come over here on boats? They came over here. They think when the, I need to know Zach. Zach, in fact, um, the native Americans didn't ride horses from what I understand at first, those were brought over by Spaniards, by the Spaniards. And so, um, well that's how the whole deal with the ink, the ink is thought they were gods because they were riding horses. They were pretty amazing. Where God's like, they had no idea what the fuck was up. You imagine you see somebody riding a huge horse, an animal you'd never seen. He'd be like, what the fuck is that? That's why I always try.

Speaker 2:          00:54:28       When I ride, I was riding naked just so that they, so I looked like a Centaur. You do look like a sentence. Yeah. I never know where to put my balls. I just rested on its fucking backbone when I need side first guy to ride a horse. Must have been a bad mother fucker. That's what I mean. How about the first guy? I decided, you know what? I'm going to write a fucking book dares mates who dares me throw eight. No, let's go further. Throw a testicle, cinch on that fucking bull and tie my risk to it and I'm going to fucking see how long I can stay on it. They tie. You got to tie your risks of that fucking thing. That's why when they fall off and they get caught and they're being flopped around like a ragdoll and stomp. Yeah. Have you ever seen him get stock guys die that way?

Speaker 2:          00:55:09       No. Why didn't you have to tie yourself on? Why do you have to find, can you just hold on? I don't know what a piece of it like part of the macho thing you got to tell yourself mom, cause that's how you stay on the bull on. You can't hold on. You know when it's moving like that buddy of mine, listen to this. You want to hear some crazy shit. I forget what branch of, whether it's a rangers or what branch of the special certain forces, whatever you have to do. He was talking about when he bailed out of the system and this was what they were going to have these guys do, they were going to tie them together. They hog tie them and throw them in the water and then you die and then bring you back and they bring you back. The navy seals that that's what the seal teams doing what?

Speaker 2:          00:55:47       That's his fuck dude. They want you to be willing to drown and be convinced that your boys are going to go in there and dive in. Once the bubbles stop by the way, okay and no sooner the bubbles stop. You go in, pull the guy out. He's drowned. You've pumped them out and rescue him and give him CPR and bring them back to life. They did the seal team, seal teams, the seal team six apparently to wrap your brain around that, but dude, and that was it for him. This is where I'm drawing the line. I did not know you guys were going to go here and I've never known that there was, we were doing today. No bench press.

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       No running. You're going to die and we're going to bring you back. Trust me. Fuck Outta here. Fuck. I'll wake up with you making out. Nah. Oh my God. Could you imagine what must be going through your head who, we'll just dive in there. Hogtied and drown. It's always that way. It's back in the, I remember back in the day they'd send you out with a, with a line in the Masai Mara, the Masa and in Kenya and the bound to they, they'd send you out with a spear and go, Hey, guess what you're doing. You want to be a man? Go kill a fucking line with a spear. And they said the real men would get the line to charge him and is in line with charge and jump. You let it fall on the spear. Uh, yeah. Jesus Christ or what if you miss your fucking dad.

Speaker 5:          00:57:03       I was at the MGM and it was last weekend for the UFC and they have lions in the middle of the casino. Dude, there's this big glass room and there's this gigantic apex Predator. It's and it's got a wall and it's whacking the ball around and little kids are sitting there staring at it, going look and pointing did what I was doing. I remember I was doing mad TV and I was on the set and they brought a 525 pound male lions on a chain and if it was the lion they had, they had done the drawing of line, came over and they were wondering why I wouldn't go near it. I was up on the landing and they're like, dude, it's tame. I was like, fucking shut up. DNA kicks in and it looks at me like I'm a gazelle. We're not a fucking thing.

Speaker 5:          00:57:47       It's team. What does that mean? It's 525 pounds to kitty cat. It's still got its instincts full intact and your hold your food. It's one, maybe two generations removed from the fucking job, man. What are you going to do? Make yourself hard to swallow? Now you sure that he's absolutely exercise to the fullest so that he's not a little uptight and tense. Right? Right. Maybe he's having a bad traveling. Might be freaking him out. That's like elephants. That's like elephants. Elephants kill their handlers, their mock boots all the time. Elephants, it's really interesting when you like, cause when you're, when you talk about breaking an animal, they have to break an elephant and it's awful. They tie a a small elephant to like steaks and they basically beat it. I saw this thing, this a documentary. They, they'll break an elephant spirit problem is that now you're riding your elephant and the Ma, it's in India.

Speaker 5:          00:58:35       It's like kind of a religious thing and I think in Thailand they, they will bathe it. They live with it. They spend all their time, they feed it, they bay that they clean it, and they get very attached to their elephants. That an elephant one day just decides, you know what? This is ridiculous. You are a parasite on my back and I don't fucking feel like doing what you're doing. So I'm going to have, and they rage, they'll go off and erase race and when they get their handler, they, a lot of times we'll just keep, they'll, they'll stomp them till he's jelly and pull them apart with their tosca holding arms off and shit. And you're not doing a goddamn thing until he's done. Wow. Making mincemeat for real out of you. You know? That's why no chimps, no fucking elephants. That's the theme of this podcast. Help me if a dog's

Speaker 7:          00:59:22       target humans in some parts of the world too, especially if they've lost loved ones to come through, they come through villages. If they've lost loved ones to poachers, they develop an attitude and they developed a hatred for humans and then they go and attack and smash people's houses, just smashed their houses and pull them out. They're so big. And so powerful. Your House is nothing. They just walk right through your house. I mean, literally just kicked down your front door. Popey blowout, stabbed him to death. It's crazy. They don't give a fuck. No, it's an algorithm. It's just so strange. Even you think about Africa and the quantity of gigantic things that can kill you there. India too. You know, back in the day, a lot of people tied. There's the cobras. A lot of people die that way in the rural areas. It's amazing when you look in Africa, I mean it's one of the reasons why, you know, like African culture, you know, if you look at the rest of the world, like all the inventions that have come out, all these different places, the most dangerous countries, Africa, and that's the place where like the least amount of inventions, right?

Speaker 7:          01:00:20       It's like you don't have time. No. You know, if you're, if you're living in Africa, you're actually growing up and developing in Africa. You got fucked man. You got dropped off in some place. You're born in an area that's filled with monsters. Aren't they? More advanced and other monsters like Kipling's woodworking and stuff like that. I mean, living their lives. There was an awesome documentary on the Congo and these, uh, talked about these fishermen that, that uh, the literally from the time that they're young, they hang off trees and is it a raging river underneath them? And they've developed this intricate system of, uh, of nets that they create themselves. They make their own rope using twine from trees and shit like that. And they're, they're hanging from these fucking trees over this raging river and it looks like if they fall in their fucked, if the very least you're going to get smashed, you may very well drown. I mean, this is like some serious rapids and they're scooping fish up as they do it in the handing the nets up and it's really fucking complex. And if you look at it and said, well, you know, they're very sophisticated for living in this environment because if it was me in that environment, how the fuck am I going to get a fish and this raging crazy? See, I'm not going to figure that shit out.

Speaker 5:          01:01:23       But it lived at the Masa in Africa. And he told me that these dudes can tell you the difference between like a blade of grass and, and what it means and what kind of animal pass through and why that animal chose that play of grass to eat. And he said they're there. They have an encyclopedic knowledge of their environment. And it's like anything else. Human beings adapt and, and you know, they use their, their minds for what is relevant to their survival and their, their, um, their flourishing. They're probably,

Speaker 7:          01:01:49       it's a trippy thing. These are tribal guys that a higher, uh, well, Americans rather hired them to go and hunt and they, uh, they take him to Africa. Like there's, you know, there's certain guy, game hunters yeah. That want one of everything. They're like, Ooh, last time I got a zebra, you know, like they're shooting zebra. She just stood that, I never want to say that trophy hunting. It's a strange to me. Very weird. Yeah. I don't, I on one hand, you know, it can be argued that hunting actually pays to, uh, when, when you pay for a hunting tags, it pays to keep everything

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       healthy. Yeah. Because, because if you manage the environment, you put, if you put, if there's a, if there's a profit in your environment, so if you, if you're making money off of, off of hunting, it's in everybody's interest to preserve that. The, you don't want to kill the goose with the Golden Egg. You want to keep the goose alive.

Speaker 7:          01:02:37       It goes towards money goes towards management and conservation. And that's a really tricky thing when it comes to hunting. Even in America, like I've had, I've talked to so many people but hunting and they have this crazy fucking like almost, you know, Disney movie view of, of what, what me eating meat is and what, you know, meet where meat comes from. You know, like, man, you don't want to do that. You don't want to take some deer's life. You want to do that. Like, do you want understand leather shoes? But first of all, do you not understand that you have to, do you understand that unless you want a nation filled with mountain lions, right? You have to kill the deer. Okay? Cause otherwise you're going to have no predators. And then they're going to be sick. They're going to starve to death everywhere. They're going to be hitting them with cars.

Speaker 7:          01:03:13       They're gonna die, miserable, horrible, vicious deaths. You got to call her. Yeah, you have to, because otherwise they'll just, I mean, it's a natural balance. And in the way we've set up civilization, we're not allowing any predators around us, you know, which is a pretty smart thing, right? So because of that, you know, if you're not, you've done a predators and you have all these deer, you have to fucking shoot some of ours. You've got to manage it. People, they don't want me to mention the venison is good. It's delicious, it's delicious. Did the crazy idea that you're not supposed to do that. [inaudible] it's such a strange argument, you know, are these these fucking deer gonna live forever and cure cancer? Like what are you talking about? Stupid. You're going to die eventually anyway, by the way, let's be honest. Their food, I mean kind of the food. Yeah. Food shipped. Beautiful. Yes, they are definitely beautiful. I'm not saying eat all of them, but you should shoot a few every year

Speaker 2:          01:03:59       there's a reason they're animals. They're animals of of flight because predators like a minimalist look. Delicious. Yeah. Did you punch a deer if it wasn't an attack, you back, dude, these are dangerous. Deers. Fuck human talk. You back. Would you? Why would I do that? I don't know why. Don't want to hit it. I've had it. You would have had if you had a pet deer that would get you laid. How you guys close? Want to pet my deer? Every single girl in the world like tamed it. Do you have a way with animals? Do you remember that movie? Beastmaster? Yes, I do. With dude who was like sculpted abs and no shirts and he's just ready. He's just in tune with all the animals of all time. Ran a show of all time there. I said I fucking lived the beastmaster. What was his deal? How was he selling tool with the animals blow. I fucking, I took his class. I'll tell you, we don't have time right now. I took his workshop doctor due to what workshop hit the beastmaster work. She had a workshop. No doctor Doolittle. You had me really excited. I was like, I've got to go to this workshop based mastery. Well I had those two goddamn parents so that was pretty much and two dogs and a snake. What an asshole. I was. You've had a bunch of crazy and my thirties I did

Speaker 7:          01:05:13       well. You know what man, if I could have a children look a gigantic reserve,

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       how can my backyard, I know we've talked about that before. A building, some very thick wall managing it like a zoo environment just to have a huge chimpanzee I closed. That's going to protect me. Like I just want something on my next to me all the time that just might, you know, turn that may have hard times. How would, how would, how would a GSP do against the chimp if you muzzle, if you muscle that he couldn't bite you with those fucking, those mouth tasks. Crush it. It would crush your bones. They're talking to, dude, I was, I was in, I was in the San Diego Zoo and I was watching the mountain gorillas wrestle. They're the best wrestlers on the plant. Strong, but they're also wrestlers that they grow up wrestling did the babies, all they do is wrestle all day and they do good moves like Granby roles.

Speaker 2:          01:06:02       Real drags, real real is to arm, arm drags, Granby roles. I mean guillotines it's amazing. It's incredible. Wow. I was literally, I'm telling you I'm not kidding when I say it, like ankle picks. Crazy shit. Feigns docs. It's at the San Diego Zoo. Go there, there, there, and you can go right up still to the glass and then there's the silver back. Could just sits with his back to everybody and you just look at this. 600 pounds, six foot one gorilla, six one 600 pounds. No Fat, ladies and gentlemen. No fat on it. He 600 pounds. Six one. That's two of Brock Lesnar's. Okay. I would love to watch them. All he needs is Broccoli. That's all he eats is fucking grass. Grass and bamboo sheets and shins. Isn't that incredible, that, that big and that strong and it's mostly to keep everybody the fuck away. Yeah. Just let me fucking eat.

Speaker 2:          01:06:54       Oh just let me sit here and have some fucking vegetables. They were trying to figure out how strong a mountain gorillas and they couldn't figure it out, but there was this log that took like seven men to move cause they, it was part of the exhibit and the mountain gorilla had a little tantrum and it flung the log. It flung, it didn't just throw it but full, you know, when you fling something it means it's really light. Like don't fling that bottle at me. It really is a trip that they're so strong and all they do is eat vegetables. Like what happened to the gorilla that made it not want to just pick some animal up and start eating at one day? I don't know. It's a weird to cause they're just total her before is, you know. Yeah, pretty much right there. I don't think they eat any meat. Chimps, chimps eat a lot of it. A lot of meat chance organized hunting parties. Yeah. I think we've talked about this before on the show. You and I have, I'm not sure if we have, because it's a subject I can just don't ever get tired of that so I never do. I can't, I can go on forever. Talking about, Chad was talking about fucking hunting chimps all day.

Speaker 6:          01:07:48       Did I tell you went to a fake Fogo de Chao the other day? A fake, a fake one. It's called like Samba at universal and forget a child if you've been there where it's like all you can eat meat, like there's come and bring shit to Haas Korea. So I sat there for half hour and the only thing I got was a guy with a sausage come over. So I'm like getting kind of pissed and I've told this the waitress like four times. Like all right, I went to Bacone, I want some kind of meat. Have been here for 30 minutes. Right, right. So then they get one come over with one piece of meat and slice it off and send it goes boom, boom. And all these dancers come out like these Brazilian dancers and all them people run away and you're just sitting there watching this show for like 10 minutes and then you come back and then it was, it was the most like obvious, like we only want you to eat a teeny piece of meat and then we're going to go over here and really like I love, I love a little dancing with my meat better.

Speaker 7:          01:08:41       I was at a restaurant once when they started doing that and I just, I just was like, no, I don't want to to pull me out of my chair. I'm like, no thank you. I'll take dancers any day over the accordion and the guitar and that, that, that sing.

Speaker 6:          01:08:55       Oh, it's going to let you know when you're walking in the door. I was in the Dominican Republic with my family, by the way, family vacations or the worst, but anyway. Yeah, but I was

Speaker 7:          01:09:08       way rather have someone played music than someone tried to pull you out of your chair

Speaker 6:          01:09:13       dance. That's what this chick was doing. Just like, come on. It was just, it was just trying to step up and down trying to, it was just trying to confuse you so you don't realize that you're not eating meat. Say that you would get stuff and then you get this headache stuffed because there you're eating salad bars. Okay. I want you to notice to check 30 minutes once a month. I really love,

Speaker 7:          01:09:35       I just like Brazilian. Why don't you come down for the UFC? UFC isn't August. Um, I've seen him there. Okay. We're going. Really? Yeah, we're going to Brazil. I'm, I'm in there saying that now. It's a, yeah. I don't think the card has been put in place. Check through it cause it's quite a ways away. It's an August. I'm off to figure out who they're going to fall over. Leave. I'm pretty sure it's locked in. It's coffee. Better in Brazil. Coffee. Yeah. Brazil stone. Really known for their coffee. No, no, no. I always thought so because Columbia, Hawaii, Hawaii is the best coffee resilience with big asses. Yes. And toxo plasma. That's the place where people were infected by that cap of 66% of the people. What you don't know about this. Oh my brother. Got It. You talked about it yesterday unfortunately, but I've been bringing up again because you're going to freak the fuck out.

Speaker 7:          01:10:25       I noted there is a, there is a parasite called toxo plasma and it's a cat parasite and it infects rats. And what it does to rats is it gets the rats and rewires their sexual system and has them attracted to the smell of cat piss. So these rats start going weird cat piss is and like literally a testy swelled a whole deal. The cats eat them and now the cat has this parasite and that's how it travels from cat to rat. And it gets to humans and it gets to humans. If they touch cat shit or they touch it when it's in the field and when it gets in your system, it does two things for women. It makes them more sexually promiscuous and it makes it more submissive. And for men it makes it more arrogant assholes. And they even have correlated it to successful soccer teams. When you have the countries cause it makes you so aggressive and so reckless. And you look at countries that are successful

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       in the World Cup also have very high rates of Toxoplasma and their population. I need to get some time. Want to know you don't want it because it slows your reaction time to either was a doctor on, on, um, uh, there's a youtube video. I really forget the guy's name. I'll have to go over it again. But it was a guy who was a toxoplasma researcher who, uh, used to work in the emergency room and he found that when they tested people who were motorcycle accident victims, a disproportionate amount of them were toxoplasma infecting wow. And it made him reckless. It makes you reckless and it may even saw your reaction time. That's crazy. It's really strange. But it's a, it's a, you know, it's a real brain altering parasite that's affected 50 million Americans. I just want to see what, in 30 years when we've really kind of got a lot of this biochemical chemistry down and how our body's reacting kind of pills they're going to come up with.

Speaker 3:          01:12:00       Are they going to be able to eradicate something like this so you can figure out a way to send nanobots in there to kill all the question, what the fuck would they do? How would you kill something that becomes a brain parasite whenever people ask these questions, you know what I'm saying to myself? People say, well, you know we're going to and we're going to come up with different things, but there's always going to be playing all death and there's always going to be these issues and new diseases and new mutations and stuff. Nobody's time is finite. You just have to accept that. I mean make use of it what you can and keep it as healthy as possible, but you must accept that it's fine. I know I'm always working out though. My, my, my buddy who's a writer and doesn't do a lot of stuff, but he's a kind of intellectual guy and he's always looking at me and I'm working out and I'm trying, I'm doing my dead list and I'm doing all this stuff and he's like, look at the little man trying to stop the clock trying to slow the clock tab.

Speaker 3:          01:12:43       Right. That's true. But you know what man, it does one thing for me for sure. It makes me like a blow stress out and makes me see the world. It makes me feel better. I loud, I didn't exercise. I know everybody thinks it's a vanity thing and a lot of it is vanity. You know, there's a lot of guys what you know, you want to look good, you want to look better, you don't want to, you don't want to be sexually sexually discussed. Wow. So talk about like in it part of my standup now I'm just talking about how I really also think it's, it's genetic. It's also like you want to do a couple of things. One you want to look like you got to, you know, guys, bench press. There's no reason to really deep bench. Isn't that kind of a useless exercise?

Speaker 3:          01:13:18       You never really do the best of scapes. Yeah, yeah it is. But I'm just saying that usually you're not in a situation where you have to hip escape and I'm mad, but I'm going to hip escape but at least three days. But it's good. But it's just a breeding instinct. We want to fluff our feathers so girls know, see that we've got that going and we want to look like we can fight the tiger man want to look like we're, we're, we're, you know, that's why guys fucking, you know, you've got to look like you. You're the bench is not really that important, but it flawless. You know, it's like your peacock here. It's like, it's like birds, man. She's really funny when you see some dudes look completely disproportionate. These weird bodies with chicks, strippers, like a big chest. I read it and Muslims fit this bro.

Speaker 3:          01:13:56       There was this one dude at the gym. He had this giant chest and giant arms. Okay. And then he used to wear sweatpants. Okay. You never saw his legs, but there's no way they could match his upper bodies I'm provided was massive and his neck was like a small man's are. That's a terrible thing goes this man woe, woe. Always got to look at the neck. You've got to look at the neck and the legs. Actually first, crazy wobbly. I was like, this is the weirdest combination of I like this guy. Just decided to just everyday do the same goddamn exercises. Yeah, flies just packed. Deck blew up his body, but there's probably a complete disconnect between all three systems. I bet his body works terrible. It's probably so confused as to why it's so heavy. I was five. That's why you, when you roll with a guy like that, a lot of times he's a bodybuilder and he feels like you can move them so well and then you get some due to just as kind of a thick neck and kind of like a big base and just big legs and all of sudden he's tank.

Speaker 3:          01:14:47       You're like, why can't even move you? While the would a lot of people do that or like bodybuilder type strength guys ignore the legs and the back. Those are the most important things for your movement, your legs and all the way up through your upper back. You know, your, your core, like your ability to stay and keep your own position and the ability to resist being pushed around and your ability to push off your legs. That's the most important thing. So when guys are always like doing like bench presses and shit, like you're concentrating on the dumbest shit you're concentrating on most of the least important shit. I was asked you, um, obviously I'm a huge UFC fan and that you talk about this a lot so I don't want to talk about it too much. But um, one thing I always notice when I watch it with a lot of my friends, we always talk about how detailed your knowledge is about the fight game and, and you know, you've always been a fighter and you boxed and you did a lot of taekwondo and you did and he wrestled and Jujitsu and you continue to.

Speaker 3:          01:15:36       But how much has your, um, your understanding of fighting evolved? Do you think it's evolved a lot or have you always kind of had it? Yeah, well, you just watching the fights, it, it evolves because you see more things, you know, you see more. I don't just watch UFC always watched like k one, like I'm a big fan of a k one kickboxing and Muay Thai watching Brian and the Jelly, the Jelly, the jelly is good too. But I don't know what you're talking about. Don't you, you, when Jelly, I don't know what you're talking about, split, but don't you think it's, but are you surprised that you're watching really great wrestlers like Maynard and uh, and, and um, uh, what's his name? Frank. I under, yeah. And watching to a top flight college collegiate wrestlers box. Now it's like becoming, it looks like it's becoming, it's almost like I'm starting to see why boxing even came about.

Speaker 3:          01:16:25       It kind of like evolved into boxing ultimately, you know? Well, I don't think so. I think what it is with those two guys is they're both really good wrestlers. It's really hard to take each other down. So it's almost like, and they want to stand and bang because you know it, it starts to become like a, you know, a thing, you know, he's going to meet me in the center of the octagon and we're just going to swing leather, you know, you know, hey, if he wants to stay on with me, you know, there's a lot of that. So there's, the guys want to knock guys out. It's the best feeling in the world, I'm sure. And you guys want to submit guys too. And I think both guys are really difficult to take down. And so when you're really difficult to take each other down, it's like, what are we going to do? We're going to try to take each other down over here. No one wants to go to the crowd anyway. It's exhausting. He'd rather, you know what I mean? The quickest way to win, I mean, if you can't catch a submission, obviously won by knockout and gray.

Speaker 7:          01:17:10       Maynard had some heavy, heavy hands as you saw in that fight. Dude, I've never seen anybody hit so many times in the first round. Get hurt so many times and come back and win the next round. It was incredible. Incredible. Maynard is a beast man. He rocked him with a left hook and then just started like beaten on a man. I mean it was, do you see anybody else seen them as high as one 90 he gets big. It's big. He's a really thick kid. He's very, very muscular. I know he's got those classical all the way down on his hips. He's one of those guys that like when he cuts, wait, he really, you know, he has to die it for a long time. Like he has to know in advance when he's fighting, has to die. It get his body fat real low and then slowly dehydrate himself.

Speaker 7:          01:17:47       He said they have it down to a science. So when he gets in the octagon, he's not one 55 he's probably one 65 one seven nine somewhere around that. And he's a, he's big. He's very heavy. So super strong, you know. And I couldn't believe that Frankie Edgar fucking take those shots, man. It was crazy. He's, he's just incredible. He just kept going and he would not quit. It was several opportunities for him to quit. Well, he was just getting bombed on that. If he wanted to give it up, he could have just given it up. He never for a minute quit. I'd be, it was so impressive to see how he or manner did against Jose Aldo. You taught them well, they're going to, apparently they got a rematch, which I think a these guys going to rematch, which I think is going to be fantastic.

Speaker 7:          01:18:26       You know, I think when you got to fight, that's that close to God. It was so close. There's so many arguments. Like, you know, what was the first rounds at a ten eight round was a, some guys have said it could have been a tense seven. You know, obviously I'm not a judge. I don't, I don't really score the fights that way. But I think, you know, if I, if I looked at it, you know, you looked at it like as far as rounds one and you know, fuck it's close. It's real close. Right. The big thing is the first round. How much damage did you give Maynard in the first round? Because a lot of the other rounds are like, man, there's a few of them that were really close, just incredible that Acre could come back like that. It's incredible. It's in grant. What's your calling?

Speaker 7:          01:18:59       The uh, Maynard adjusted really well too, cause he almost punched himself out in the, in this first round. And I saw that I was having a hard time, but then the third round he got loose again. So he came right back. So you know, when you've been wrestling since you were that young and you've been learning how to suck weight and you, and you have to train that hard, they're sewed mentally tough. You know, I the most mentally tough and I went to Dan Gables intensive wrestling camp and I was in high school and they train us so bad. It's so hard. I, I, that's when I decided I'm not wrestling in college, so he was just a nightmare. I'm not doing this. And Dan Gable guys famous for that. Well you know Dan Gable also has like two hip replacements and two to fact knees. Yeah, that's crazy.

Speaker 7:          01:19:35       He really literally wore his body down to the bone. Well he does that with his Rassler's um, apparently it's a mental thing. Like he'll, he'll just wear you down to the point where, you know, the real interesting argument about that as the eastern Europeans, they don't do it though. There's like a bunch of mother fuckers. I swear to God it just looks the other phone. I have two phones in my office. Shit. That's what happens when you're a billionaire. You know when you're a kid and your mom told you to don't crack your knuckles, it makes your fist bigger. What's that? Do you remember when you were a kid? Your mom told you not to crack your knuckles cause it'll make her knuckles bigger. Did you ever hear that as great? Yeah. I always thought like, Oh yeah, my crack my knuckles. So I have a bigger fish and I could punch people better.

Speaker 7:          01:20:16       I think I just started cracking all my knuckles to think that's how I'm building my body's muscle up and I forgot that. That doesn't really work. Like, Oh man, I'm just glad I'm not a, I don't have to fight for a living and that's it. Hard life. I respect those guys are phone problems. I swear to God I disconnected bolt of them. Yeah. Get rid of your home phones. Who uses home phone? What's your call? What's your call on up here? There's no cellular service. What's your call on silver bells. [inaudible] Anderson is an interesting fight. You know Vitor is a really dangerous guy. Like as far as like a box on his, yeah, his hands. He's really dangerous. So fast. You started rich Franklin fight, quickie took out. Franklin's crazy. If he unloads on you like that and catches you, he comes with a swarm of punches.

Speaker 7:          01:21:02       Man. I know. The only problem with vittores had this in the past. He just had a harder time in like the second and third rounds maintain the same intensity. But uh, and he's had some mental issues, but he had to like a really, a lot of like real serious personal issues. Like his sister was kidnapped and murdered. Yeah. A lot of hard stuff happening. First thing they ever go through it. And then he's such a sweet person, you know, you have to make a living so you have to fight. So you're forced to take fights when you're not in a good state. And, and I'm not making any excuses for the guy, but traditionally if you watch his fights, he's very, very strong in the beginning of the fight issues that he has is in second and third rounds. Yeah. So at one 85 the idea is that he killed those issues because it was before it was that he was carrying her on too much muscle and now he's much leaner at one 85 which was his natural way, isn't it?

Speaker 7:          01:21:47       He's probably a bit bigger than that in real life, you know, probably closer to 200 pounds. But you know when he's in lean shape, like ready for a fight. Yeah, I suppose he's so ridiculously athletic. He always was super fast. Like his, his reflexes are, it's very good. Yeah. You know he's had, he's had some issues in the past like Alistair Overeem submitted them, but you know, the reality is a lot of that was probably fatigue. If you're tired, man, you leave your neck out there and a guy like Al Star jumps on it. It doesn't matter who you are. No it doesn't. You know, if you're finding them and may find you're not adequately, physically prepared, it's, you're going to do some students show, it's why to me MMA is, is the greatest sport because it requires everything. It requires like literally not just your courage and, and you have to be in top physical shape, but you know, anything can happen.

Speaker 7:          01:22:32       The margin for error is so slim. You make one mistake, you get tired and even the training that you have to go through to become a really good boxer, to become a really good wrestler, to become and to stay in really good shape. That's just a full time job all the time. Yeah. And what happens is you, you mean you, you have to decide where you're going to dedicate your time. Is it going to be in a strength and conditioning? Is it going to be to work in your skills? Cause you only have a certain amount of hours in a day and a certain amount of resources in your physical body, you know. Exactly. You're going to burn yourself out to the point where you can't recover and, and there's no money in it. I mean, the other thing, especially in the, and this job man, it's like worked at high levels.

Speaker 7:          01:23:07       There is though at the high levels there's rock star money. You know, like George Saint Pierre is balling. That guy's making ridiculous raising money and Brock Lesnar made ridiculous one. Yeah. I mean anybody who can sell tickets, chocolate dealt ridiculous money. Yeah. But it's the guys who can sell, you know, paper views. They can write the guys who can, you know, get a piece of the action guys who were, you know, who are legit starts with what the UFC has done that so smart, you know that a lot of people have said about is they've made the name UFC bigger than any fight. That's the smartest thing to do and went to ever done. That's the whole thing is that the brand name is bigger than any fight. And the good thing about that is that everyone in the organization that's, you know, it's in there, they can get them to fight each other, you know, and when you have like outside of, there's like a bunch of different promotions.

Speaker 7:          01:23:47       The argument for that against that rather is what's going on with Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. They just won't fucking find each other. It's like Floyd Mayweather just doesn't want to find them and just keep it off. And you know, I want drug test thing. I want, I want to take his blood 10 minutes before the fight, which is fucking, I mean they just, they're convinced many packages. I was on steroids. But then you look at his last fight, he was 20 fucking pounds. It's so crazy. The Margarita Margarita Margarita was an animal and it's a big comeback fight for him and walks around at one 75 whatever big dude and, and, and has never actually been heard, I don't think Margarito and outlined that and pack out just he figures your game out mostly by the way, stopped them. So I shouldn't say he has never been hurt. That's not true.

Speaker 7:          01:24:29       I forgot about that fight. That was the fight where I can't believe I forgot about the fuckers. That was a fight where you get exposed for having plaster in his gloves. So that was, that was actually the codified. No, no, no. Oh, sugar. Shane Mosley. Yes, absolutely. That's why he came out like almost projected and humiliated and he was suspended right out and sugar Shane Mosley beat the fucking shit. And that was a fight where a lot of people were saying, well one of the reasons why, I bet he got his ass kicked. He probably felt super guilty though. They got caught with his hand in the cookie jar that he had been doing that to people for a long time. A lot of people suspected, oh sure. He like broke up code. He broke up a lot of guys. It really, really dangerous man. Frankly, to be honest with you, I would have banned him for life for that.

Speaker 7:          01:25:05       I mean it's kind of ridiculous that the only got a year band. He's outrageous. If they could prove that he had done it more evil, even just proving that you did it once. I also think I also personally think anybody who does that and lets their trainer does do that. I didn't the whole campus scumbag and then it's just a scumbag, shitty plaster. In 2010 you putting plaster and you're ramped worst. Wow. You know, but meanwhile what I said Mack Manny Pacquiao 20 pounds fucking light or lights him up like a Christmas tree. Nobody's come close to this guy. He's, he's just probably the greatest fighter ever. I really think he's greatest boxer ever. It's one in eight different weight divisions. I mean, how do you argue against that? Right. I mean, if you see what he does to all, to all these different fires, he's a politician too.

Speaker 7:          01:25:42       Oh, and by the way, when he fights all of his country, all of the Philippines stops to watch crime goes down. No pressure, Manny. And he goes in there like, hey, what's up everybody? Hi, how he's waving due to in the stands before he even tried to hype up this fight by talking about, you know how his training camp hasn't been going so good. Like you watched the Hbo 24 Seven Man, he's so distracted, Manson distracted. Meanwhile he gets in there, I got this thing that dude's just watching the fireworks go off. He's standing in front of that little fucking, that fucking little lightning bolts fly lefted right. And is he seeing little sparks in front of his eyes every 10 seconds? He's like Roberto Duran when he was younger, but, but way better. Like he's so touches his belt. He comes in and does that weird.

Speaker 7:          01:26:22       He loves fighting to men even though he has so much to lose, he still loves fighting and he's a born fighter. That's what I think is that the hardest thing is when you, when you become that biggest celebrity and you have that many fans and you get into a ring, you have a lot to lose and the great champions can somehow put that out of their heads and he seems like he makes him elevate. It makes him better. You know? He seems like the weight of these people behind them just make some better. Some people are, you know, some people would talk trash, it doesn't work. So I'm other people do like chill Sona and obviously talking trash away does, it helps them. It works for him. I don't know. Well the thing about Manny Pacquiao too is that he seems to be doing everything perfectly.

Speaker 7:          01:26:58       He like, he seems to be a really nice guy. Yeah. It didn't. You tell me. He also plays a pool, like I'm going to be, well level plays better than me. No one thing that doesn't fashional level pool, that's crazy. He's not good at is singing apparently. Well yeah, he plays Karaoke and shit, but give them some time. I'll probably get good at that too. If you really want it to, we'll be with you by an Italian. I'm going up shit about his thinking. He'll probably higher voice coaches and just become one of the badass opera singers of our generation. Never be able to deny him. He's just a bad motherfucker paid versus old Tyson. Who would you go with? Wow. Coming from, he's a tiny guy. No, but if it was, if they were the same size, that was the most interesting thing about Tyson when he was young is that he moved like a man much smaller than him.

Speaker 7:          01:27:39       You watched like the Mike Tyson Marvis Frazier fight. That is one of the most disturbing boxing matches ever. Cause Marvis knew what was going to happen. We knew it was going to happen. Tyson knew it was going to happen. The announcers knew it was going to happen. You know, they were all talking about it. This is, you know, a lot of people saying this is a mismatch and then Tyson just comes rare, renowned him moving like, like in, in frames. You're not even seeing all of his movements because he's moving so God damn fast and all of a sudden he's hurling these left hooks in your direction and you feel your rib cage imploding and before you even react to it, another one's hit you on the other side of the head. He was having trouble finding sparring partners cause he was crushing people too badly. He moves so fast.

Speaker 7:          01:28:18       That was the thing. He didn't move like Ali where he, you know, would move with fancy footwork and dance around Joe Frazier style. You know, but, but, but different because with both hands, you know, he would throw rights and laughs with equal abandoned, you know, whereas Joe Frazier was a big left hooker and he had a diesel right hand, but it was nothing like Tyson's, Tyson's famous for that right hook to the body. Right uppercut combination. He was a fucking, for one brief moment, one brief period of history, he changed that whole sport. He changed watching boxing, watching boxing was never watching an execution. Okay. It wouldn't, Marvin Hagler was fighting good guys. Like when he was fighting John the beats Mugabi. It was like a big fight, right? Everybody got excited about it. Like, Holy Shit, I'm [inaudible] punch it. And it was a fight to macaby knocked out Terry Norris Mugabe is a bad motherfucker. Mugabe's get serious power. You know, this could be the fight for Hagler Mike Tyson's fights were executions. It's like, here's Bruce Seldon, here's Mike Tyson. Look at Bruce Selvans knees shake. You know, all of a sudden Tyson's charging after him. Boom. The fights over. Well, you know what they said is that

Speaker 5:          01:29:16       uh, Don king used to set up monitors and he'd have a highlight reel of Tyson knocking dudes out and when you are going to fight him, he would always step the monitors up. So the fighter in the MGM, when it would have to walk through that, oh my God, Don king was nuts that way. And so you'd be fighting and you'd just see these highlight reels of him.

Speaker 7:          01:29:34       I just crushed it in slow motion. That makes sense. It's the monitor attached. Fantastic. You got to go fight Mike Tyson. Some of those guys were so intimidated. That's a huge, I met him one time in Vegas at Dyson and you just get put on weight, but he's so thick, like his hand is so thick. His, his, his hips in his head, everything is just so wide. You're like [inaudible] just a different human being. I never grew while he's locked. He was just so compact and fast. He was a new model heavyweights and six feet tall. Me To me, like if you would've picked the prototype of what I, what I like just the ultimate like top of the food chain dude. That's what I'd like to look like. I always wear black shorts and black shoes. Do you remember when he came out of prison and he was super yolked like he came into prison, that prison, all he was doing was push ups and sit ups and tat tips and getting tattooed with fucking are controversial.

Speaker 7:          01:30:25       Pete's Rashers Take Kong mouth. They don't kill about 40 million people crazies. The Arthur Ashe Tattoo. It's like, all right dude, I got ya. Okay grace. He's a fantastic mother fucker. Che Guevara. He's got take tattooed on him today. It doesn't mean Che and Oh yeah, he's a fascinating motherfucker, man. For that brief moment. Look, I said that he changed the whole sport, changed the whole sport and he lost his trainer. Right, right. Well, I lost a bunch of things. There was a bunch of things that happen, you know, fame happened and it also, it's almost impossible to keep up the level of Rpms that he was operating at. You know, when he was at the very top of his game, when he was like challenging for the heavyweight title and it was training, you know, getting up at five o'clock in the morning every time, running. What's once, you know, once girls start coming into the picture and money starts coming in the picture, and he said to Todd Phillips recently and the hangover two, and he goes, he goes, I'm that, Todd told me this story. And it was funny, we were talking about the power of women and how, you know, it never, no matter how much money you make and stuff and they're all women,

Speaker 5:          01:31:21       well it's kind of in a rush, you know, and, and uh, and, and Mike Tyson said to tiny goes, man, I've heard it all. I've had, I've had, um, I've had money, I've had fame. Uh, but if God invented anything better than poor thethe keeping it for himself.

Speaker 1:          01:31:38       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:31:39       Oh, he's keeping it for himself. That's brilliant. Oh my God. That might be the wisest thing anyone's ever said. All right man. That's genius. That should be in a book somewhere. Someone folks, someone put that, put that as your Avatar is your signature at the bottom. You know, you want to do that free screen name. You need that. God Damn, that's

Speaker 6:          01:32:00       did you said that guide that we talked about yesterday, I don't know if you saw, those are not Brian. There's this homeless guy that has this really awesome radio voice and uh, he was a bum on the side of the road and this guy just filmed them and like, you know, it like here, you know, here's some money and the guides of wide thank you very much. And it was just like the most creepiest video. Anyways, a day after like he's really probably play it for Brian's. Right? It's really quick.

Speaker 2:          01:32:23       Oh, sorry. I wish I, I've always wanted to have, you can do fuck Outta, you can do any voice to tell people that I want, I want a voice like this is just natural. It's just got a lot of gravel in it. Just a sexy kind of like a lumberjack was just a guy who keeps you real calm and get you a real horn. It when he talks how old he is, your maker either love master 17 years old. He looked at it, but a 20 to me. All right,

Speaker 6:          01:32:47       right. Sorry. Crepey sorry. I'll wait. No, that's not it. Great. And now this place is flooded,

Speaker 4:          01:32:52       dude. I always tell people there's two, two funniest moments now. The funniest moments ever. One of them was in the hotel, you and me and Eddie Bravo and Larry and a couple other dudes and we were really super banked and you went into your Brazilian Jujitsu rapist character. Oh my God, Dude. I remember laughing until I literally couldn't breathe. Like I've said, this is, this is the funniest moment I've ever had in my life. There's that moment. And the other moment is Joey Diaz on the Alex Jones show. Those to me, I haven't seen that. You have to say it. It's the most ridiculous thing ever. Joe, you know Alex Jones show is all kept. Trails are taking up our sky. Kate bio chips, they're doing it, they're putting it inside children's cereal. Ladies and gentlemen with the elitist, they want to lower the population and vaccines and you know, it's all like crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:33:40       We need to buy gold. He gets nutty. Joey DNS comes on because Alex is my friend and I've known Alex for like 10 years and he's right about a lot of things. I mean, he's really right about a lot of things here. And I think the only way to chase things down the way that guy does, you gotta be a little loony. So he's a little loony, but he's a great guy. Alex Jones is a great guy, but he's got this conspiracy theories theory, a right wing kind of a radio show. And Joey comes on it and we go onto the internet break. But grind Q, that shit up. We go into the homeless guy. You, I played the homeless guy. First Day. I'm gonna make you work for your dollar.

Speaker 2:          01:34:13       Say something with that great radio voice when you're listening to nothing but the best of oldies. You're listening to magic 98.9 all right, you can take it. You so much.

Speaker 6:          01:34:22       That's how I use it. So that guy got a job that was so anyways, yesterday that, that, that video hit today. The was it the colts gave him a house and a job working for him. Is it the cult? I think, yeah, the Cleveland Colts or whoever the Cleveland Cleveland is. It's great. If I didn't find out what is, cause it's give them props with Kevin. Here's the Cleveland Cavaliers. Cavaliers, the calves I should have or a basketball team. So they picked him up as the announcer. Yeah, they pick, well, they offered Williams a full time job doing voiceover work for the team and a free home in Cleveland to the is a motherfucker.

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       Love it. I love it. In one day that guy, he's got a house, there's all all together. It's beautiful and it's a great story. Brilliant PR move for life.

Speaker 5:          01:35:10       Friend was giggling and showed me this thing and I looked at it. It was a man I was trading himself and I was like, yeah, I've seen a few of those. I was like, great. That's what, I don't need the internet.

Speaker 3:          01:35:18       I watched one where a guy, um, tied off his balls with rubber bands, detailed every single aspect of the balls dying and him cutting off the balls with a serrated knife. I didn't see that. I saw the hatchet job. Oh, crime. Any crime, any crime. Money. There's a lot of crazy motherfuckers out there, dude. God Damn. I wonder if this home is shit's going to catch on and all these homeless people are going to start trying to do voices. So now there's, this can be tons of homeless people coming up. You going, hey, how's it going? Hey, can I have someone? I think there'll be like a slow like incubation period before it hits the homeless people because most of them don't have any internet. So it's going to take like six months of somebody trying to drag them into a library. Mcgee, go see this cause it heroin.

Speaker 3:          01:35:58       If it's not, I'm not going. Huh. And then not January, this guy got a job. We need a neck. This is like a Fred Flintstone. Unless they start eating to Barney rubble and let's they start reading their toilet paper, you know, I'm like, oh no. Do you remember Fred Flintstone and Barney rubble? They're always like, there's always scams to coming up with things. They always had some new skins come up with an eye. We're going to start a band. You remember, he was always like trying to figure out his shit. And his wife was always cock blocking and holding them down. My Buddy, my buddy, uh, it has Asperger's syndrome really? And he's 50 and he's really smart, but he's also completely crazy. And we were driving and he's 15. It looks to me,

Speaker 5:          01:36:37       he goes, he goes, I'm thinking about something. I go, what? He goes, I think we should start a band. And I go, wow, that's a really good idea. Johnny,

Speaker 3:          01:36:48       is he driving a, you drive? I'm driving. He goes, thank God

Speaker 5:          01:36:51       you gotta do you think so? I go, I do think so. The only issue is that I don't think either one of us sings or plays an instrument. So what would we do? He goes, well, you know, you're a charismatic so you could figure something out, you know, and I would, I do sing, I do sing. Um, I, I've always had music inside of me. I go, okay, but if you saying, that's good, I don't, I'm a shower singer, so what would I do? And he was like, you know, like just the tambourine and plus you could just be the leader of the band. I was like, you're the greatest human being old time at. I'll do that in a heartbeat. So anyway, anybody who wants to join me and Johnny's band, please, please give me a call.

Speaker 3:          01:37:26       Can they get a hold of you on Twitter? Are you going to have auditions for the band? You know, I would, I, you know, for me, I just, it's funny, I wish I played an instrument. I don't, I never had the patients. What's, what fascinates me is why some people choose certain instruments. Like the guitar, I get it, you get laid the piano and the drums, but the Tuba, that's the dumbest fucking instrument. Like there's not even a, there's not even a song. Really. Yeah. You just, you need a huge brass band and you only play like

Speaker 5:          01:37:48       boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. You know, there's no really like full songs for the two. But we're like, um, what else does a couple of the

Speaker 3:          01:37:55       accordion, certain things that people have a calling for that are, that fascinated me. I always just slow, what was that movie? The Spike Lee movie about jazz with Denzel Washington movie. What was that quote? Better Blues Blues. And I still love watching like, like the part where Denzel Washington would take out his trumpet and he would clean it. It was like a ritual and then he would go through all his practice routines. Like he was so disciplined about his practice. Tropics, we try to get at them and be like, I've got a practice, I got to find a, yeah, you know, Wynton Marsalis talks about that he's considered by many to be the greatest jazz trumpeter, you know, in the world. And as he, the dude that was on the tonight show or was it his brother? His brother Brandford. But um, but witness is considered a real real maestro. Like, like in the, in the, in the, in the same pantheon is like, Yo, yo ma or even even, uh, Louie Armstrong. I mean, so he's just completely dedicated to the [inaudible]. By the time he was 19, he was on a physical technical level with the trumpet that was so far superseded anybody in the field. Almost, and, and they also say, and I've heard this from people like Harry Connick Jr and stuff, we say that he does things on a trumpet. You're not physically supposed to be able to do like your fingers. I'm supposed to be able to do that stuff. Yeah. And cause he can just move them so fast. Such dexterity and the things that he does, but

Speaker 5:          01:39:13       talks a lot about, um, you know, just, just what practice means and the kind of thing that I believe he's still blows on a read an hour a day, you know, which is like a beginners thing. But, but he says if, you know, the daily practice, the daily adherence to practice is what, what changes everything. And not only that, he also talks about like when you do a performance and you come off and you've got a high and if you killed it, that energy, a lot of people go, well, I'm going to have a couple of drinks and celebrate actually what a guy like that we'll do is go, I've got all this new, all this new energy. And he goes and shuts himself in the room. And practices even more with that new found sort of rush, that energy. And you know, he talks about the difference between being truly great and truly original and being like everybody else is or those kinds of, those kinds of things. You know, like pushing yourself to that level. Everybody has their own process of course, but nobody practices as much as he does.

Speaker 3:          01:40:09       Yeah. The discipline, the adherence discipline is so attractive. You know, in my mind it's like, so what I would like to be doing, you know, I stay as disciplined as I can, but I'm so fucking pulsive there's so many different things entering into my interest all the time had, pardon me, says, well, that's where some of my creative creativity comes from, is this fascination with a constant need for, you know, all this new information and new things and yeah, but it's also, it's also a distraction. Yeah. It's massive. And I also think that in some ways, like I always think that you get to a certain point in your life where you, in a way, no, everything that you need to know to create something perfect and beautiful. But it's, it's new. Current Shit is the most fascinating thing to me. I mean every, the crazy thing about what's going on the Internet now is every God damn day

Speaker 7:          01:40:54       you get Twitter messages and a message board messages on my, my, on the Rogan board where it's all these new incredible scientific discoveries, all these new weird things that are happening around the world, like the thousand fucking thousands of birds that have died and fallen from the sky and Arkansas and everybody's going, what the fuck is going on? You know and heard that's viral just because they're filming angry birds right now. What that says viral videos for the angry birds movie. Are you serious? I think that that's, that's a rumor that's going on, right? There's no way you're going to kill thousands. What happened? They actually think what happened was that's like the fireworks jail for fireworks. 10 years actually roused them from their sleep and they rent, they couldn't see and ran into like different chimneys and everything. They just, they get it, they stay, they flew.

Speaker 7:          01:41:37       Well that doesn't make sense because there's thousands of them and they're over fields and shit. The thousands of them got scared and fell from the sky deck. That doesn't sound right. It sounds like bird flu or something. Maybe it sounds like they fucking poison them or something. That sounds more like, yeah, there's probably some, you know, loud or something. And there's the conspiracy theory angle. There's a bunch of people that are trying to pawn it off on this one guy. I should, I should know this man's name, so I'm going to look it up right now. But this guy just got killed and he was, um, a chemical weapons expert and he was tortured and murdered and a real thing. Yeah. And they think there's some sort of a connection to it that the guy turned up missing. And, um, he turned up missing and, uh, I think in Delaware and they found them in a landfill.

Speaker 7:          01:42:21       He had been murdered. Yeah. And they believe that this guy, um, was, you know, here he is top you as official. Yeah. He, um, it's, it's really kind of creepy, man. Their stories are very bizarre because this guy was like, uh, he, he worked under George Herbert Walker Bush as well, and he's an expert in, um, and um, um, uh, weapons and biological weapons and chemical weapons. It's crazy shit, man. And, uh, the, the course of conspiracy angle is that a, they were testing something and killed all these birds off and he might have protested a freaked out or, you know, I, I've been, I spent a lot of time reading the history and I, one of the things I like about doing that as opposed to even looking at where we're headed is how, how little, how much change, but also how little changes a lot of ways.

Speaker 7:          01:43:07       And the man's name is John P. Wheeler for anybody who wants to look into the story, John a Joe Chen, p wheeler, w h e l, e r. And just type that into Google. And I'm sure a bunch of different stories will come up on the sky. This is the same thing that somebody printed to all the websites in with like I s or anything. Some of them are the ones that are legit, legit ones that aren't claiming any sort of conspiracy. Those are interesting because would they talked about is the fact that this guy's television was turned on full blast and it freaked out his neighbors cause he was a really kind of a quiet guy and it was an older guy. They didn't understand why it's television was ty co was like blasting like that. Well television really loud is one of the ways they hide the sounds of torture.

Speaker 7:          01:43:47       So they found this guy's house, um, and there was a yellow police tape in his kitchen and they pulled up floor boards and they roped off the chair. So the idea is that it is very possible that they might have talked to this guy before the killed them and they might have tortured him in his own house and then they killed him and then it took him to a dump. Yeah. It's, you know, it's, it's interesting when a guy has that sort of a backgrounds, you know, so, you know, and like I said, I know, I'm not saying by the conspiracy theory, I'm saying, you know, first of all, it's creepy that this guy got fucking tortured and murdered or at least the very least murdered the torture part. It's speculation at this point, but it's a, it's an interesting little thing. I don't know if it has anything to do with all these, uh, this guy.

Speaker 7:          01:44:24       You can pretty much connect anyone from that store to that store if you really had to type without not, we're just guesswork. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah. Me Basically we were just making pieces of fiction. We don't really know if he's connected to it, but the idea is oh two, that's what I want to talk about. In Abu Dhabi this year, they made it rain 52 times. Did you know that they made it round seating? Silver got like a strict payment doing, they've been doing cloud seeding system. They probably made it right in there more than $52 and they've been doing cloud seeding for many, many years. But this, this is something that they've come public about and that, that Abu Dhabi better at using, they're using it as a weekly strategy. They're like, I mean, 52 times. That's like once a week. Man, that's crazy. If they just choose to space it out like that, they want to make it greener.

Speaker 7:          01:45:06       They're very ambitious. Yeah. How crazy is that? They're happening where they're getting the drawing in their water from. It wasn't there before that apparently there's moisture in the air and especially where they live there, they're near a lot of ocean and there's moisture in the air and you have to coax it out. But I mean, what are the repercussions? What are the repercussions of that? I mean, what is the, I mean, how safe is it to be spraying shit in the air? Well, they've been doing it for many years. I mean, they've always done cloud seeding. I don't know how effective it is and I don't know how good they've gotten on it. But, um, I know that that's been around for since at least the seventies. I think they're getting better at it. Yeah. This Abu Dhabi thing was fascinating because I've never heard it discussed on like cnn.com or you know, any major in major news website.

Speaker 7:          01:45:46       But that's what they were talking about is very, is, is, is I guess from what I've read becoming really ambitious, they really want to become sort of the new Arab, that center of, for the new Arab world. You know, there's sort of the, the beacon of light, if you will, for a different way of doing things. They got crazy paper, dude. They got crazy paper. They go crazy paper. But, but live in like that man, make an artificial fucking rain showers. Holy Shit. That's crazy. You know, it's just, you always wonder, does that, is it good? Is that going to affect something somewhere else? Uh, is, is forcing it to rain somewhere else for saying like a fucking hurricane to, to grow over here on the other side. I mean, isn't the sky all somehow or another connected, isn't the environment connecting sell? I don't think that, no, I don't think that a localized, you know, rain seeding of cloud seeding. It's over. How big of an area do you get away with it? But that's the thing. I don't think it's a, I don't think you can do it over a large area and so on. It's hard to do. I think so. I don't know if they figured out how to do it all the time and obviously they have, they've done it 52 times. That's pretty consistent. If they just decided to do that, that would be such a trip. If Allston, we went over

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       to two, I would dominate. It was like West Palm Beach, Florida. It's fucking dead and shit. Everything's wedded. We're headed. We are becoming more and more in control of our environment or at least trying to be. But then again, we're also losing some control of it. If you buy into the whole global warming, you know, that's the story of the Annunaki. That's the story from the Sumerian text. The reason why human beings were invented, the whole, the Zechariah sitch and craziness, you know about all this. The story was that these alien beings from another planet came to earth because they had ruined their atmosphere with their technological race and so in, in they ruin their atmosphere and they needed gold particles to suspend in their atmosphere to protect them from radiation. And the sun's chill with that. That's pretty well. And that they had done exactly what we're about to do right now.

Speaker 3:          01:47:35       And the, the, uh, it's the most ridiculous thing ever. It's called the 12th planet and he wrote it back in 1970. But what's fascinating is the idea of suspending particles in the atmosphere that had never been discussed until like the year 2000. And they had like a global symposium on, on, you know, protecting the earth from environmental hazards, like losing the ozone layer, losing our atmosphere. And that was one of the suggestions for suspend reflective particles in the atmosphere. That's pretty wild. Yeah. That you could do that. You could fill the sky with silver and gold particles. Well, gold to the s the crazy thing about gold is a tiny little piece of gold can spread out so far. Gold dust is so fine. It's like incredible moving. The other issues that you're, you're actually, they just created bacteria strains, um, from a computer. In other words, they, they cross pollinated DNA and created lifeforms, bacteria farms that had never existed on earth that it's called synthetic biology. This guy, Craig venter and his team, if you go to ted.com you can see his lecture and when when they, for the first time on a printer, they print it out essentially the structure for a completely new life form and, and would that has far reaching implications in the sense that for the first time human beings might very well be able to control their own evolution and certainly create new life forms are going to be such a fucking mess. It's going to be create, it comes with great promise, but also peril manifesting in fire.

Speaker 3:          01:49:07       Yeah, no shit. With your paper monster, what the fuck you're doing? You're going to make a new life forms with your computer. How nuts is that fuck, things are getting weird. I think it's going to get, I think it's going to get to a point where we won't really be able to figure out like, you know, like I was thinking, I'm reading this, you guys, if you ever, if you ever just take, take three months and do it in two months, it, I'm reading blood Meridian Cormac McCarthy's a masterpiece. It's, it's considered by, when they reviewed it in 85 they said this is one of the great feats of language in the past 50 years. It's, it's the, it's the, and it's about a novel. It's a novel and it's about the sort of the settling of the west and it follows these, this track, this group of 19. So,

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       um, um, men who are hunting Indians, what's it called? Scouts. It's a brutal book. What's it called? It's called Blood Meridian blood and Maria and, and you know, we all know what happened. A lot of people may not, but what happened to the native Americans, and it's just, it's the same old story of one group comes in with guns and they basically decimate, you know, not just what disease but with bullets. And everything else. But um, God, I forgot what I was going to say, but it was about, um, oh yeah. What I was gonna say is that if you look at what happened as they started settling the west is that the, the, the Europeans were killing not just all the buffalo, they were killing all the other animals as well. They got really efficient at it because this, they lay the railroad, they would shoot buffalo and in the course and then they would place the bodies with strychnine.

Speaker 5:          01:50:31       Now why would you do that? Because all the other animals with feed on the buffalo and they would die with stuff, the strychnine. So then you could scan them and send all those pelts to Europe and to the east and to the east coast and stuff, whether it was big money. So in of course, a 20 years, probably 500 million animals died. If you look at the old paintings and pictures of the, of the, of the Great Plains in America, they looked like the Serengeti and, and of course, the 20 years, literally we killed all the buffalo and so many other animals. Not just the wolf that fed on the Buffalo, we killed him, but everything else. And, and um, so what happened for a lot of the native Americans was their entire mythology, entire mythology there. Religions were wrapped up with their environment and the animals around them.

Speaker 5:          01:51:11       And in 20 years they were all gone. Forget the fact that they were starved to death. But they're, they're very, they're very mythology. They're very religion. What would the cornerstone to their culture was eradicated and you really wonder, you know, what, what psychologically they were going through as they saw this true holocaust sorta unfold for them. You know, it's in its historic, when you think about right heel short of a time period, that is right. And I always think, are we going to come up with a certain kind of technology that does the same to us? That's the question. I mean nothing. Nothing says that our culture and our way of life and our even lives are guaranteed by anything. I mean if you're very religious, you believe it is. But for people who tend to have more of a scientific bent or have a, Oh, take a real look at history, it's very possible that, you know, there are threats out there eventually maybe of our own design that could render us extinct or abs.

Speaker 5:          01:52:08       Yeah. The idea is that light keeps going in a direction of more complexity. Things getting more and more complicated. In the issue with the Indians was you're dealing with, okay. American Indians, native Americans, we're dealing with people that were so fucking crazy. They were willing to get in boats and go across the ocean and across the country to a place to live. Yeah. You know, and then just trek out on their own to the middle of the fucking country. There's giant continent that was literally filled with people that were living like the rest, the rest of the world. They were living like a much, much, much more modern. I mean, American Indians before that

Speaker 7:          01:52:46       we did, before we had introduced or the, the uh, Spanish or other had introduced horses to them. I mean, they were like no manic tp living Arrow shooting motherfuckers, you know. I mean it was really crazy. It's like they were living just like the people that they find today in the the Amazon rain forest, there's still finding people like that. Today they found a bunch of new tribes. There's like, I got, I got, I can't remember the number, but they have this fascinating photo of one that they found that's near the Peru and Brazil border and their skin is covered with ink. They're covered with red ink and two of them are red and one of them looks like like a black color and they're just covered with like this crazy war paint and they're holding bows and they're pointing arrows at the airplanes. The airplanes take pictures of them.

Speaker 7:          01:53:29       These are undiscovered, untouched tribes that's are completely isolated from the rest of the world. It's wild. So that's really what American Indians were like. Native Americans were like, and unfortunately, whatever the fuck humanity is doing here on this planet, what we're trying to do is be more better, faster, bigger. What the fuck are you get out of my way. More. Better, faster, bigger. How about a fucking metal box that rolls on metal train tracks and it goes 300 fucking miles an hour and it cuts across the whole country. I mean, we just more better, faster, more, better, faster. Live in teepees is just getting in the way. It was like, what are you talking about? Sacred ground. Sacred ground. Sacred ground. Mine says money. Okay, we got to kill you. We're going to kill these people. We gotta kill him. I got tell him we got a calendar they want and not reasonable.

Speaker 7:          01:54:09       It's the same old story of history is full of that stuff. That history is full of one group that comes into another group and says, you guys are in the way, man. You got to either leave or die. I mean, yeah, it's absolutely wrong. I mean, not no one has justifying it. It's absolutely heinous. It's absolutely disgusting, but objectively stepping away from the old whole idea of emotions and humanity and people in genocide and all that stuff. If you look at it as like, you know, in a direction that humanities, that's inevitable. The point is the DA unimaginable can happen to people. And, and it happens to huge groups of people, whether it's Russia, the Russian Ukrainians in the 1930s, under Stalin or the Jews under Hitler and, and, and you know, in the, uh, later thirties and up to 45, the unimaginable. The, the, the, the unspeakable can happen to millions of people.

Speaker 7:          01:54:56       Millions people can perish in a period of make the argument people make the argument. But that was then, and now the age of information, the South Hospital. Now look at the, we have not changed that much human beings. The one difference I will say about history, thank God, is that it becomes harder for bad men to get away with things for a long period of time because there are a lot of people watching and, and that's a very good thing. You know, you're always going to have, if you have an incentive structure that gives, there are always people in society who are willing to do what others won't do. And, and those people always flourish in chaos. They always flourish in war when Russia fell apart. That's right. It's the people that are willing to do what others won't do that. That always rise to the top in in a situation where there's no rule of law and Sandra,

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       that's the enemy and that's not good. That's not good. That's why you have to fight for representative government. You have to fight for all the things the founding fathers Taco talked about because it keeps bad men in check and so whenever you start blaming individuals, it's like kind of blaming the way of the world. We're always going to have. You're always going to have bad people. You want a system that keeps them somewhat neutered. That's very important and people don't challenge. People don't understand the the, the logic of countries and met. It's all stupid man. It's all stupid. I want to show you a video and the video is the hodge on the mosque. I know all about the hush, the hodge on Mecca and watching all those people mill around the post and go, listen, if it's just you and your scantly connected group of friends and you, you have some sort of a conflict with a group that's as connected as these motherfuckers, you know, they're willing to do a lot of crazy shit and you're willing to die.

Speaker 3:          01:56:38       There's something quite beautiful about the hot, amazing. And the Hodges is beautiful because in, in, in the notion as you were two sheets and whether you're a prince or a pauper, you're in the same group. You were a two sheets. When you go on your pilgrimage to Mecca and every Muslim has to do at once in their life, at least you go, you go and you, you fast from sunup to sundown. And usually if you're strict, I don't even think you're allowed to drink water, but the notion is we're all equal under the eyes of God. So it's a very egalitarian movement. So when they make their pilgrimage to Mecca, they were two sheets and they are, they are, they are we in? So you can be right next to some of these worth $1 billion and you have nothing but under the eyes of God when you're there, you guys are all the same.

Speaker 3:          01:57:20       You're all eating the same foods, you're all behaving the same way. And it was this notion that Muhammad came up with was this notion that, look, we need, you always have to go and, and, and basically we, there's got to be somewhat of a, a communal, a communal pilgrimage, uh, humbling pilgrimage to show each other that we're all the same. It was kind of a unifying thing, movement, very important and ritualistic things like, absolutely. Absolutely. What does that box supposed to represent? The big square building that I believe is where Muhammad was buried. Mohammed, I believe it was born in Medina and he died in Mecca and Medina and Mecca. And I, I'm sorry if you're a Muslim and I'm getting them mixed, uh, switched around. But Medina and Mecca are the most, um, they are the most religious places in Islam. There are truly the most religious places.

Speaker 3:          01:58:07       Notice on when you pray, you pray toward Mecca. So when you go to hotels or things in, in the Arab world, Muslim world, a lot of times they have arrows pointing to Mecca. Is there a lot of prep iPhone APP? So he not there. There may very well be. I'd be surprised that there was, there has to be [inaudible] if there's not out there developers, you know what the fuck to do? You need to make a mecca iPhone APP. I need to know. I'll pay my respects towards sparco fuck listen. So he was, he was buried there. Yes. That's incredible. So He's under that box somewhere. His right. I believe that's, I believe that's the stone he was, he was the,

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       I believe, and I just read about this and I'm sorry that I don't know it, but I believe that the stone was where Mohammed received a message from sort of an angel about the Koran. Because remember that the Muslims always believed that there was one person that spoke through God and that was Muhammad. And their proof was that he was an illiterate shepard who over the course of seven years wrote, the Suna wrote, wrote essentially the, the Quran. The Quran being a essentially a bunch of poems. It's, it's written in verse and it's quite beautiful. It's quite, it's a, it's very, very intricate and with these incredible and stories and stuff, and they said, how could one man write all this in seven years? He was inspired. He never learned how to write, read or write, but he would obviously had some kind of a revelation or an inspiration. And so that was what that was where Muhammad really made his name. And not only did he do that, but mom had also was the guy who said, look, this is a bunch of tribes, a bunch of Pagan tribes. I'm going to, I'm going to unite the people of Saudi Arabia. I'm going to unite these people, these nomads. I'm going to stop them from fighting each other and I'm going to create one group of people under one banner of heaven. And that was the notion.

Speaker 3:          01:59:50       It's amazing how fucking radical they are to the gotten to the point where you can't even draw Muhammad or, yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:59:57       it's a shame. It's a shame because historically Islam was actually always a religion that was so open to interpretation and in fact we look, look, look at Indonesia, Indonesia for until very recently and even still was always, it's always, it's been a Muslim country for many, many, many years and has always been a very, very open and tolerant society. Remember that the Jews who were persecuted and killed by the Christians always went to Muslim countries first. Muslims were the ones that actually protected the Jews because they were people of the book. The Quran upholds every story in the Old Testament and believes that the Old Testament to be gospel. It's more of a rebuttal to the new testament with the notion that Jesus Christ, that it considers to be a great prophet. The notion that Christians say that Jesus Christ is actually God is where they take issue, and that was where the big rift was. But remember that Islam was always a place for the most part, Islamic countries, like the Ottoman empire was a place where where the Jews took refuge in. So that's why this, this, this rift between Jews and Muslims. Over the founding of the state of Israel in 1948 that's where all of this came from. And that's what's so unfortunate about all that. Well,

Speaker 3:          02:01:05       at one point in time, the, the, the Muslim religion or Muslim people responsible for an incredible amount of adventures to absolutely. We'll look and say it's the omen scientifically advanced. I mean, you're talking about the Ottoman Empire for God's sake. It wasn't what it is today and what happened that, that, that fucked everything up and got it to the point where it is today where there's so much, you know, it's like so many things degrade, you know, and, and get to a point where it's not what, you know, I would argue, I would argue that, and I'm not a political scientist and I don't know anything. I'm just a goddamn actor, but, but I, but I did live there for eight years of my life and I would that

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       the Middle East biggest problem is not it. I think, I think, I believe that Islamic fundamentalism was, came out of the fact that the 22 governments in the Middle East are not democracies, that they've always been monarchies and dictatorships and those monarchies and dictatorships kept people in poverty. When you keep people in poverty and you have a bunch of men that have no jobs and nothing to make themselves feel good about themselves, they're going to turn to something man, and they're going to turn to something like a religion because it makes them, and they're going to, and, and men do this kind of thing. They'd say, Hey, again, we have historical evidence for that where people say, look, there are Christian fundamentalists. They're Jewish fundamentalists. You can, you can, you, they're all over the place. But, but, uh, somehow along the way, uh, this became a perverted notion of Islam where, you know, I'm going to solve my problems with violence. I'm going to blow myself up. I'm going to go to heaven. This is all very new man and I and and religious fundamentalism. It's fairly new. It's, it's a, it's a 20th century invention. I've heard

Speaker 4:          02:02:40       a lot of people, and I don't know if this is accurate, but I've heard it from more than one source where people were connecting the mujahideen and their fight against the Soviet Union and their work with the CIA creating a bunch of, a bunch of different new things that happened in the Muslim religion, like, like suicide bombers and

Speaker 5:          02:02:56       the suicide bombers actually notion of jihad really because the suicide bombers, where did they were the first suicide bombers we were reading about it worthy. Tommy. All Tigers actually in Sri Lanka. They, that's who those were. That was in the 90s, the early nineties. I mean the Tamil Tigers, where were the ones that were actually blowing themselves up and nobody had ever heard of that? We couldn't believe it. You didn't, you'd never heard of any Muslim? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. And what are they? The Sri Lanka guys, are they Muslims? What are the, uh, the Tamil Tigers, I believe a lot of them are Hindu in fact, and now it's not. Hindus were the first suicide bombing. Yeah. So they were not, they were not, uh, um, Muslims 90 and the, and, and the Tamil Tigers were, were fierce group of people trying. They've been crushed, but they, they, uh, uh, they were trying, they were trying to fight for their own independence, their own notion of, of, you know, what they want.

Speaker 5:          02:03:44       But, um, so, so a lot of this stuff, if you look at the inspiration behind it, it's, it's pretty bizarre. You know, groups watch other groups and you know, what's the crazy bad ass, you know, listen, I mean, suicide bombing is not in Vietnam. And you had people who would, a lot of, like, women would take your hand grenade and jumping into a helicopter and blow themselves up and everybody in the helicopter. So that's just a human thing. I mean, yes. Yes. So, um, there were a lot of cases of that. A lot of kids. The Viet Cong were a tough group of people who were willing to do whatever it took to get to hard to tell

Speaker 4:          02:04:18       occupied, like, that must be so crazy. It is. You know, you're just a normal person living your life in a hut somewhere and chillin and I'm going a good time. Then all of a sudden they're soldiers coming in and metal boxes for some reason you don't understand. They're pointing guns at you and scream,

Speaker 5:          02:04:32       aren't you? It's like Afghanistan, man. The Mujahideen was, you know, the, the good example because

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       they were basically when the Soviets came in, first of all, Afghanistan, it's never been a country. You've got to understand, it's always been a group of tribes. You had to put, you had the push stones, you have the techniques, you have the Hazera and they all have always competed against each other. I mean, where did you live when you were there? I lived in Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, uh, in the Arab world. But no, no. But my mother had been there twice and my father had been there twice. I thought, I'm sorry. I thought you were saying you lived in. No, I've been to, it was kind of like you do, you did. Oh, it's doing stand. Yeah. Yeah. But that doesn't mean it. Now when you're living in these, these, um, how many countries did you live in? I was born in the Philippines. I then moved to India where I live in Bombay and Calcutta, which is now Mumbai, Bombay.

Speaker 3:          02:05:18       And then I moved to Lebanon and then I moved to Pakistan and then I moved back to Lebanon work. It would be so in love with it now. How do you think I get so much? I get laid then. I thought you were married. Oh, sorry. Yeah. And uh, I forgot about that part, but um, but then I, then I moved to, uh, uh, Lebanon again in the war broke out and we got stuck in the war and I lived in the heart of the end for six months. Holy Shit. We really couldn't get out of the country. Oh my God. I used to hear machine gun and it was crazy. You know what you're worried about? The holiday and getting overtaken was too young to worry about that stuff. You know, I was, um, gosh, I was a, I think 11 or 12, and then I was, we were evacuated to Greece and I lived in Greece and then I, and then I went to Saudi Arabia.

Speaker 3:          02:05:59       And then when, by the time I was 14, I'd, I'd, I'd never lived in the states and I came to the states. That's incredible. Yeah. Yeah. It was pretty wild. We had a very different perspective growing up and no Shit, Huh? Yeah. And the world and the world, uh, and, and what happens to the world, um, makes a difference to you, you know, like this, this Pakistanian governor, you know, in Pakistan there's called the blasphemy law and the law is if you insult Islam, you will be put to death. Now when you say insult Islam, there are a lot of ways to interpret that and people use it, manipulate it to get rid of their neighbors and things like that. And this, this governor of the Punjab, which is, um, uh, an area of a large area of Pakistan basically said, um, I'm sorry if it's putting, I don't know, it's Punjab.

Speaker 3:          02:06:45       I thought that was India, but anyway, but he was a big oven and he said, um, he was trying to get rid of it. You've tried to repeal it. It was trying to, you know, he was a champion of women's rights and things like that and I sort of a face of the more modern notion of, you know, not only Islam but with Pakistan and uh, he was assassinated. Uh, one of his elite guards filled in with 23 bullets because this recent, yeah, really recently, very recently, I just thought to myself, I thought, man, this stuff is not dead. We still are in living in a world of ignorance and of people who are willing to solve problems through violence. How about this crazy motherfucker in North Korea? Man, oh, Kim Jong, Il, he's the biggest day holding the history of the world. However, he wins biggest asshole of all time.

Speaker 3:          02:07:25       He's just a dick. The crazy thing about the Koreans is that North Korea and South Korea war with each other basically, and they looked exactly the same. It's crazy shit. So bizarre. You're talking about it. That's a monarchy. North Korea, that's a forum. They yawned while 2 million of their people starve to death in the 90s they just did. The elite was like pass the salt. That's amazing. There's just no, no power to revolt. And there's a massive amount of patriotism. It's not just patriotism, it's a religion. I mean the North Koreans believe that the dear leader is a deity man. They've done a good job of getting that. Isn't that the same in Thailand? They'll have a know Thailand is actually amazing. Yes. Thailand's king has s there's this, he has a sort of, he's a semi deity. But what's really amazing about Thailand is that they've never been colonized and, and it's because they've always been really good at compromising.

Speaker 3:          02:08:17       They've always kind of been really good at figuring out a way to kind of just be the place where you come from. A little R and r fuck war man. That's, that's in Laos. And Cambodia and Vietnam, US, Eh, we'll just align ourselves with the u s cause it's easier and you know, you can come over and have a good time. And we got pretty girls and they're just a really sweet people. Man. It's amazing to have such a bad ass fighting style. You know, most people believe the best standup fighting style in the world. Moitai maybe man, they're just, uh, they're there for, for a group of people that are so fucking nice to you and so welcoming and it's such a safe place, man. You walk around, you never worry. You know, I, you just drive around and you're like, there's no crime. You never worry about it. Just a lot of really pretty girls that you can, you know, date if you want. But you know, you're in that. But I'm a, I'm an actor guys, so just say, you know, I was always doing my scenes. Did you practice Tai while you're there? Yes, I did. One thing I wanted to do

Speaker 4:          02:09:11       do is go to a Paquette and a, there's a tiger Moitai thing and do like, I just don't know if it's safe enough to bring my whole family down there.

Speaker 3:          02:09:20       I check here it is. I know a lot of western nurse who lived down there who loved it. Yeah. It just seems very trippy risk. I just want to do it so good to me. Everything's a risk. And I think it'd be, it'd be amazing for your kids to see a different part of the world. Yeah. Murder and shit. Six flags. It's pretty scary to some wild monkeys. I think the US is way, way more dangerous in some ways and a lot of countries to visit and stuff like that.

Speaker 4:          02:09:44       Tell me that about, um, uh, I was talking about going to Mexico, like they were going to Mexico on Cabo San Lucas or one of those places and I was like, uh, yeah, but I mean, fuck man, don't you worry about, oh, Puerto Vallarta. I was like, you don't worry about like all the violence that's going on in Mexico. They go, well, you know, there's violence in America to, you know, go to Detroit, you probably won't get caught up in it. I'm like, yeah, okay, maybe,

Speaker 3:          02:10:04       but I know where Detroit is also those drug cartels from what I hear are actually starting to target tourists. Like yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:10:11       they're starting to target tourist areas because they're trying to get resorts to pay them off because they extort money from a bunch of different ways. One of the things they do is kidnapped people that are trying to uh, get to America and then they go back to the, they killed a lot of people from Guatemala and El Salvador. They just, and these people were just people that were trying to migrate to America. Well they asked for money I guess, and I said

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       no, and they just don't ask for a lot of money and they said we're going to kill them. And they do it all the time. And apparently some people pay and some people don't. And the people that pay, they get that money and they let the people free would they kill a bunch of fucking people? Man, it's really, really scary. So bad and you see the videos of these 12 year old kids that they've hired for assassins and the, you know, they've completely fuck these kids heads. Really? Yeah. And some of them were American kids. They've hired the drug cartels have hard and one of them got arrested recently and you know the cell phone video footage of him torturing people and it got onto the internet. It's, it's horrendous stuff in and they tortured people before they killed them, you know, and this 12 year old kid and you know, I mean they still evil, they're taking violence to a whole new level.

Speaker 3:          02:11:13       If you look at like what's going on in the world and all this, you know, the idea that we're over in Afghanistan so that we don't have to fight it over here. Hey, how about what is right connected to us? How about some shit you can drive to take as Mexico you can fucking drive to and that puny ass fucking wall, that's really not going to stop anybody from coming over to races. But bigger question is, would you legalize drugs? And doesn't that make sense? The only problem is it's gotten to a certain point where I think you have to squash the problem before you legalize drugs because the, the cartels are so fucking big. You have to somehow, and it's working, they're not doing it. So it's a war. It's gotta be a war. The drug cartels are gigantic now, man, look, what do I know?

Speaker 3:          02:11:51       I'm talking out of my ass. But the whole situation came about for sure because drugs aren't leaving. The problem with it being a war is that the drug cartels are very much in sync with the power structure with the government itself. Sure. It's all in the self apparently is a lot of the kind of Mexican company itself is propped up by the drug trade. So holy. So if that's the case, then how do you de legitimize, how'd you figure out a way to make it work? Do you legalize they're talking about legalizing drugs in Mexico itself. We criminalized everything in Mexico. LSD, mushrooms. Oh yeah. I mean knew you're not supposed to sell it, but if you have it, you don't go to jail. As long as there's a demand. And the risk of pedaling that demand is that high. You're going to have people who are bad ass motherfuckers wanting to do whatever it takes to get that money.

Speaker 3:          02:12:34       Scary. I mean it's every role should have learned about that in this country with prohibition 1920s I, you know, we're lucky that marijuana has the calming effect that it has because if it, if it wasn't, you know, the whole stoner culture and around behind it, if that's why. That's why I've always been, I've just marveled at the fact that you made alcohol, legal and weed illegal, that it's like goes back to that reefer madness ignorance. It's like, you know, you're out of your fucking bull. It's also an issue of it's been illegal for so long. If they'd come out and say there's no reason for it to have ever been illegal now, then you open up a whole can of worms that just brought up the biggest and best argument for any, for, for a smaller government. Whenever you pass a law, and I'm not saying some laws don't need to be passed, but you gotta remember one thing, you pass any kind of law, any kind of legislation, say what you want about the Obama health care thing.

Speaker 3:          02:13:21       I don't know enough about it. I'm not going to make a stand on it, but just know that when you have a huge government program and you pass laws around that program, what happens is a cottage industry grows up around that law and a lot of people develop an interest in economic interest. Again, keeping that law act of, that's why whenever you start a government program, when it, you started giving money to somebody or whatever it might be, it doesn't go away. And the Democrats themselves had passed just something because it will never go away and you'll be able to add to it and, and that's, that is, it's not about being right or left. It's, you better keep that in mind because George Washington himself said, men will invent laws to take their own freedom away from themselves. That's how people are, you know, you want to make the world a really fucking safe place.

Speaker 3:          02:14:10       You want to legislate everything. I don't want to live in a country like that. Fuck you. I want to take my own personal responsibility for things. Abso-Fucking-Lutely you know, and the, the, the real problem with these, uh, government, you know, when government grows is that it very rarely shrinks. It doesn't drink. It's expansive. It's ever expansive in its course. If it does two things, it takes taxes and it passes laws. Do you need that? Yes. The question is, what does w w w it's about proportion. How much is too much? That's the question. This country was founded on the notion that government is a necessary evil. It doesn't mean you don't have it, but stop telling me that government and equalizing the playing field and socially engineering equality is what makes this country great. No, it's fucking not. The creates so much resentment and whenever you have, you know, social engineering and, and you, you'd do it for, you know, like you're like, well, I think that affirmative action is a wonderful idea.

Speaker 3:          02:15:01       I think the idea that you know, you want to balance everything out and give black people a chance to, but whenever you have it set up for one, I'm like, guys, testing for the fire department or something like that. We're a black candidate doesn't have to score as high as the worst thing is that that is the worst thing for any black person or anybody else. It's true. It is assuming and suggesting to a black person that they can compete mentally. What does that do to someone's self esteem? What does it do to someone's self worth? That is the most, that is an a is the most insulting. That's the most racist thing I can think of. In fact, it's, well, it's ridiculous. Did black people need us to lower the playing field when it came to sports and music? Look what they did with jazz.

Speaker 3:          02:15:36       Look what they've done with sports. Jazz is the highest American art form. Expression is primarily at black expression. Did blacks need government programs for that? No. They're just as capable of thinking what the hell find out and they believe. They do believe that it's an issue that they should have, uh, as much as close to an equal number of people representative as they do in society. If it's 10%, it's close to as they can, but not look for it when it's not. The argument is op is equal. Equality of opportunity. Oh, you know, we know that that what people who are in the affirmative action camp and I understand it, they're saying, look, we're looking for, we're chronic trying to create an equal opportunity for people and I understand that and you do. It is an uneven playing field. It is. But the question is what do you do about it?

Speaker 3:          02:16:22       And you better be very careful when government comes in with solutions. I think the best solution if possible is to go in real early, go in and have programs for kids that are developing in, in single family households or single parent households where they're not getting any attention and they're not getting any love. They're not getting any guidance and their mom has to work and are doing that at Harlan, apparently been very successful. That would be the way. There was a guy in Harlem who said, we've got to get these kids before they even get to kindergarten. That's the movement. And he did, and he created a program that followed them from kindergarten all the way through college, and it's been, it's called the Harlem Renaissance Project. That's brilliant. That's brilliant. And it's been amazing. Apparently. That's really what it takes. I mean, well, you start with someone when they're 20 man, Mike, God so much that you don't do that.

Speaker 3:          02:17:06       And you have, for example, let's just take the black issue. If you have a disproportionate number of black men in jail, for example, the problem with that is people think it's not their problem. You're wasting a huge segment of your population. You're, you're, you're not tapping into incredible, incredible potential that you could be. And so the question becomes what you're right. I think you have to get it when, when, when a boy is 14 he's already lost in some ways. I mean, it's very hard. It's very hard to, to kind of figure out how to deal with that damage. Martial arts, who's the best way, whatever or whatever is the thing about martial arts is you have to overcome. You overcome great, scary things over and over and over again. And in doing that, uh, develops character and builds character and you almost want to make up for the fact that, you know, you were fucked up when you got into this.

Speaker 3:          02:17:51       You want to show a big gap. You know, Josh, Josh Waitzkin who was the chess prodigy. He has a school. Uh, he does, he has a school where he teaches children math. No, I'm sorry, music, chess and martial arts. And uh, and, and what he does through those three school, through those three, through those three venues, he, she, he didn't, he's not teaching you even the martial arts and music and the chest is secondary. Most importantly is you're learning how to learn. And, and he always says that, that he wrote a book about, yeah, it's a great book. He wrote, I recommend everybody called the art of learning special. My friend Nathan and my friend Nathan got me in contact with them and we've exchanged emails back and forth. And I want to, he's a great guy. Him and train with him and when I'm in New York I want to get them on the podcast too.

Speaker 3:          02:18:35       If I met him, I met him in New York, I had a lunch with them and the people don't know. He's the guy who came up with, I mean it was rather, excuse me, the, the movie searching for Bobby Fisher was based on his life, him as a child, chess prodigy. And he went from that to going into Kung Fu. He became the king who's hands to Time Push Hans Kung Fu champion, which is a heavy stuff they do, it's throws and, and, and, and he was the first Westerner in China to win it twice, two times in a row. And now he's going to, for the Monday I was I guess a phene with Jujitsu. Now he trains with Marcella Garcia and he, he developed this website called mg, inaction mg and action.com mg being Marcella Garcia. I believe that's the URL. Check it. Marsia Garcia or Marcella Garcia and action if you want to look at it, if you're a Jujitsu fan. And what the, uh, what the website is, is he's broken down Jujitsu moves just in study them. The way he would do chess because chess is so disciplined, you know, just so we were talking about the Trump

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       and I mean chess players, crap practice constantly and they go over moves and they go over strategies and the, you know, they have maps out in their head. Well what would he, this guy has done is put all that same discipline to Jujitsu. And so he has Marcel Garcia, his entire repertoire of techniques and you know, all sorts of different sweeps and you know, arm bars and all these different things and in chains and how they go. And he has like this website where you can just sign up and you can learn. I mean basically like you and your friends, you know, if you wanted to, you could sign up for it, get an Internet connection, get a laptop and have like a mat and your living room and you and your buddy could learn Jujitsu friends from school. Man, it's fucking amazing, man. Yeah, I mean, it's amazing.

Speaker 4:          02:20:02       And for for people that studied Jujitsu, it's fascinating because he'll go over the finer nuances of a technique. You're like, fuck, that's what I've been doing wrong. Because a lot of Jujitsu is leverage and it's not. Most of it's not about strength, it's about being in the proper position and much smaller people can defeat much larger people because of the technique, but it's like little subtle things that techniques sometimes you miss and so these videos are like real masters like Marcella Garcia. This is like a Sarah Garcia. I asked, I asked Josh, I was like, what's it like to roll with them? Do you ever get him? You ever catch him? And he's like, no, I never get him. No. He's on another level, man. He moves so fast that what it is. He's so good. He's still sharp, so sharp. You can't have any room for error.

Speaker 4:          02:20:43       See, with a lot of Jujitsu it's like how much room for error you're going to give me. Are you going to leave openings for under hooks? Are you going to slip to your back? Are you going to, you know, let me sweep you. Are you going to give up cause you don't want to fight anymore and go to your back and tried to get them in on your guard. It's like there's like a little battle going on. Like say, how much do you have left in the tank? Well, when you get to a level like Marcella Garcia, instead of all that nonsense in your brain, it's this super tuned killing machine that moves so fast. You can't even like, literally, he's not even thinking about his movements. He's drilled them to the point where they're so pinpoint and precise action. It's all reaction idea of getting to your back. And then before you know it, his hooks are in. He's got his arm across your neck. It's happened in Millis, Josh, Josh Waitzkin. Cause that chunking where, where,

Speaker 5:          02:21:26       what he's seen so much that he can start thinking in chunks, like he can think in systems and you're thinking move to move. And He's thinking in a system like he's thinking in, in literally like six move chunks. Uh, and he's also watching you and can, are already predict what you're going to do. And because he's been doing it so long, he gets into your mind. So he's watching you like, do these clunky, here I come, I'm going to do this. And he goes, I've seen that. I've seen that a thousand times and I'm going to do this, but I'm already going to do this after that. And so it's like Josh said that when he would play chess with guys who weren't as advanced as he, he seen the whole board. And the reason he's seeing six or seven moves ahead of time is because he's able to chunk is chunking. He's seeing things in, in, uh, I dunno, I guess that's what he called it. He just called it like, I'm five, move

Speaker 4:          02:22:16       six, move, um, uh, blocks of time. That's one of the things about Eddie style or the way Eddie teaches Eddie teachers, instead of just teaching a move, he teaches a whole chain of moves. I killed, teach a certain paths to get to a certain position and then to there and then always to a finish. But it's like four or five moves in advance. And sometimes there's, there's alternate endings or alternate branches. Like, what happens if you lose this arm? Now you've got to go to this and then you know, so in your mind when you're rolling and you get to certain specific areas, you have this already, Matt, he's already mapped it out for you. Well, it's like the way he teaches. Wow. Yeah. I think it's a really smart way to do it.

Speaker 2:          02:22:52       There's a lot of that with my love. Megan Love making love making. Tell me more. You get an echo.
