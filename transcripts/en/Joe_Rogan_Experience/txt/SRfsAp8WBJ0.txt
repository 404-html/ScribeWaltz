Speaker 2:          00:01:00       no, no, no, no, no, no. Even if they got it or they don't know. The point is like, how do you not think about how fucking gross deck you daddy did you want your porn? If you would turn the porn off, you would admit it. Yes I would. I would.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       Zelda. We're one more makers of Alpha brain. We have like actually have a start thing here. Uh, the cognitive enhancing supplement that I'm giving a Doug, Stan hope, Doug Stanhope, this in your system right now will cure you of the evil that is the mushrooms because right now your mind is taken over by an organism, by an intelligent life form. Thanks dude. Who gave me mushrooms? I thought I completely dismissed the guy at the merch booth. I think it was giving me a poster of something. He goes, you want to open that later? And uh, I go, I should check, get my merge bag, which is scary. When I travel, I have to scour my merge bag, a bag of whatever it might be. I thought it was a poster. It was a rolled up giant envelope, but it had mushrooms in it, so I can't travel with them, so I don't go low. I'm going to fucking either. Usually I just give them away, but I fucking, I haven't tripped in a year, so he didn't go and I'm coming to the Rogan podcast and you're on the Alpha brain. I don't even, yeah, Alpha brain. I might, let's smoke some pot too. I don't even really that awesome. Later, later, it'll really fuck this fucking, I don't know. Might be good. I have a show tonight. Let's those washrooms

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       and put you on a different fucking the do. Do. Do you understand? You're going to go back to Worcester to the ACLU. Aclu. That's how deep this is going to fake it. Are you familiar with what new nootropics are you ever tried any things? No. No. I was like basically the loop. Joe, let's get you in the loop. Duck Stanhope let's get Shannon a little ducks. Stand up. You need a podcast? My friends telling me to. Oh, you should shop at the Co op instead of Safeway. That's the fucking, yeah. Oh, the Co op hip. No, I live in a fucking small town. It's called me and people. They don't, they're not in the loop. They're not in the Internet. Well, no. What's there on the Internet? It's a global world. Doesn't need a fucking Internet. It's just done a 6,000 people. They yell out the window.

Speaker 2:          00:03:39       Well, that's what you really are. The Internet, because you're in a town of 6,000 people. You need to be connected with everything else each other. Well, that's all good too. But I mean, just for sanity's sake and to keep in the fucking loop. Yeah. Well we'll give you some of these, what's it called? Alpha brain. Brain cognitive enhancing our supplement. We also have new mood. That is a five HTP Sarah time. I took a three capsules of 0.3 2.4 milligrams of mushrooms on the trip here, which was at one 30 who knows how much is it? Well, you know when you eat a mushroom, how much of it is like cellulose put them in capsules. That's what I'm saying. So let's just cap had a capsule. So yeah, you might like to see me a fucking instruction. That's why I was, oh, he did a [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:04:29       It's like a grant per capsule. If you really look at, the guy gave me like instructions on the fucking, well, we hope that the Alpha brain doesn't set off. The fuck point is here. We wanted to send out my own plug. Thanks guy. Who I completely dismissed. He looked like so you know, I have no idea. I thought it was giving me a poster as the universe. He's just an agent by the way of the universe. Some guy that fucking tried to barge into the green room, Brian with a tee shirt even. I won't, I won't plug him. Go to fucking Joe rogan.net. Click on the link, entering the code name, Rogan, and get 10% off your Alpha brain supplements. That was one of the best commercials we ever did. Folks. I know you don't like

Speaker 3:          00:05:10       commercialization gentleman, but it's a fucking free podcast. I know. They're ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          00:05:17       The ridiculous. They need to be edited. This is a good argument for the unnecessary having a producer. All right, I need a real producer. Yeah, it was fun. She goes, fun arguments was a fun. What did you know the difference between that and that's the fuck you just hit a button and now we're actually talking. Now it actually is the talking. I no longer have to promote anything, but in the beginning, before we start the way, the way we got it out of the way, we used to just talk about the flashlight all the time and then we figured out once along, somewhere along the line, it's best to just get it out of the way and then go about the podcast. So that's the, even if it seems a little disingenuous, but I am just, it's a vehicle. I'm bit scatterbrained. Doug, Stan hope on his way over here.

Speaker 2:          00:06:00       My good buddy. Dunked Stan Hope. Well, I've not seen in probably like a year, a year, somewhere around there. Yeah, no, it's, it's been a while. Maybe a year and a half since the last time I did the show. Yeah, man. Yeah. Yeah. And when, when let's see your live show, dude. I learned something I learned. I don't like going to shows where I have to stand up. Oh, that was a couple of years ago. That was, was it fucking Kit Kat club? Yeah. That's like you make years ago. Do you have people sitting down and, no, I'm doing it now that I can cut my own deal. I'm fucking dead back at the Improv. Oh, that's nice. Oh, so they just, they gave up. They came around. I can do an off night. What's going on with Joey's microphone, Bro? Oh Mike, I need, I need fucking buck a lot. They got all these open mic as Tuesday too.

Speaker 2:          00:06:43       It's Doug fucking standup. It's all over. You've got all these fucking books during the week. Bring it this fucking savage. But I can do one night. They're on an off night and bring my own fucking crowd. You were one of the first guys who figured out how to get your own crowd online. You know, you, what you did was really a smart move by just leaving the comedy clubs almost completely and just going a little rock and roll clubs and booking it yourself. And yeah, it was all out of spite. Spite does, it drives me a lot. Well, you really drive, but it was genius. It was ballsy needing to fuck these motherfuckers know you're a voice and you've got to get the fuck out. I don't give a fuck what you do. You don't want to hire me. I got to keep doing what I do. It's the best way that you did it. The best way though. You, you, you really found your own audience. Like you're one of those dudes where you'd go to see a standup show, you know, it's a fucking Stan help crowd. We see him walking down the street, you know, they're all days from suicide. They're all small kid. I was in Calgary where I actually crossed this. I, I'm looking for the GIG. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, we talked about this last time.

Speaker 2:          00:07:50       Wait, Calgary, there's a train station in front of where the Gig was. So I see all these fucking who'd loans standing. I think that waiting for a train. So I crossed the street to get away from them and then only to realize that was they were waiting not for the train, but that was my gig. That was the fucking queue for my fucking show that I'm crossing the street to get away from my own fans cause they seem scary. That's one of his fans right there. Look at we're to stand hosts fans right there. That's how he shows up with the outfit. Not Making me look at fucking is it dude that's on fear factor. This new season of fear factor. And there was a thing on CNN, uh, about uh [inaudible] you are saying, oh yeah, if I, if they did fear factor, I'd suck the Devil's Dick again. And then now I'm fucking watching football and here is [inaudible] he was back out Rogan's big fucking huge head and my face, I'm 55 inches. A fear factor. I love it though. They came with the long money, Stan hope they came with that patient home. Cash in the middle of the fucking world falling apart. We're way too old for fucking talk about selling out or all that shit that young comics care

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       about rivalries. Dane Cook. Hey Dane Cook. Thank you very much Dane Cook lay. I'm doing this fucking benefit show in Tucson that it's a long story, but they, Dane Cook's that, hey, I haven't done standup, but I'll help you out. Like fuck thanks. Thanks a lot. Lee. Who gives a shit? Someone emailed me today about men. See It is new Med z thing is homey. So hot around and touches on your bit. Like who gives a fuck fucking internet snipes doing the benefit. No, he's not. He hasn't done standup and almost a year

Speaker 4:          00:09:30       I don't have a clue where I ran into him at the premiere warriors, not to name drop. It's on the red carpet. Avoid the Paparazzi Dang visible. Like snipey about that. Like yeah. DANCO well he didn't put the like, uh, I don't know how Twitter really works, but he said he didn't put the apostrophe thing in front of it. So he's just telling you your own fans that he's promoting. Like why? Oh, I see. I see. I don't know how Twitter works. Yeah, he didn't put the a, the apple are just still sell fucking country. They're very comfortable old people. Well, people are looking for a reasonably content because they're trying to distract themselves from a shit life that they live. Instead of looking at their life and trying to fucking figure out their real problems. They just go online and just fucking don't give a fuck a comedy anymore. Do you? I care about good colony. I still live, but I still enjoy it.

Speaker 4:          00:10:21       I realized somewhere along the line it's mostly just jealousy and insecurity. And you know, one of the realize, one of the things I realized is that people have shit way of looking at comedy. When I used to tell people that I'd take Joey on the road with me, I take people, you know, like, uh, like who'd you do rascals with? Oh, Joey Diaz and I, he goes, you bring fucking Joey Diaz on the road. Like, what are you crazy like you, you, you follow Joey Diaz on purpose. And I was like, and I couldn't understand it. I was like, why would you even think like that? Like why does everybody, everybody's worried at every moment that they're not the life of the fucking party. Like at every moment they can't even enjoy when other people are funny. I'm like, you don't want to be around funny people. That's all I want to do.

Speaker 4:          00:10:59       I want guys to fucking crush in front of me. You know, I want, I want to just, I want the whole thing to be fun. I don't want to just be the only one who's having fun up there. Spoiled socially because yeah, my fucking best friends in the world. Literally the funniest people alive. So spoiled. So if you try to hang out with the idiots, go to your fucking, the in laws are so shit udo when they tell you you could do this joke on stage, they don't understand. They don't see if feel like it, you know, when I was, I was dating this girl one time, she's a nice girl, but I was at a transitionary point in my life. There's nothing bad about her. She was just who she was. Was young girl, want to do what you want to do. She was always upset.

Speaker 4:          00:11:40       She was, she's a good girl. She was a really good person. But she was always upset that I was doing other things and I was hanging out this pool hall all the time and she would always give me shit about it. But you know, I finally, I had to have a sit her down and have a moment like I have fucking fun. You don't understand. Again, I have to remind people I'm tripping a bit. Just picturing you at a pool hall is a flashback in a movie and weird hair on a full head of it. Back to Joe Rogan and pool hall days back. No, it wasn't in Boston. It was New York. I became obsessed when I first moved to New York, but, uh, she, she hated it. She fucking hated it because I never wanted to hang out with her and I would tell her, look, you know, and I had a conversation with him like, look, you're a, you're a very cool person.

Speaker 4:          00:12:25       You're very sweet. I don't, I don't want to date another girl, but I don't want to fucking hang out with you every day. Well you hate chicks, that's all. Hey checks. I hate dumb ones though. I hate dumb dudes and I hate dumb checks equally, it's not a gender thing, it's just dummies. But when you're in that situation, man, when you're just like, God, I just can't, I can't hang out with you all the time. It's, it hurts me. It hurts me to know that there's all this fun going on over there. I'm hanging out with you and these dudes are gambling is staying up to three in the morning and no one's married. No one knows what the fuck is going on the next day, they're all wild gambling motherfuckers and they're my friends and they're funny and they say funny shit and I'm like, what am I going to do?

Speaker 4:          00:13:00       I'm going to hang out with you and what are you going to tell me? Like what movies you like? Well, you didn't tell me what you like to eat. You know what your mom said. That was mean. You know, she's just fucking Christ. I want to go have fun. Yeah, no, I think go ahead. Are you to foreground? I hate to fucking, I'm talk. No, no, I'm good. I'm good. I was just hit a roadblock. Cramping. My mind is so important to have friends that are fun. You know, it's the, the, the one thing that you, you know, you get out of the podcasts and shit too though. These like people that don't know anybody, like you don't know anybody like Joey, they get to talk to you essentially on a podcast. They get to kind of feel your vibe, see how you think about things.

Speaker 4:          00:13:38       When you sit down and see somebody talk for an hour, you don't just see him talk. You see how they think and you see how they decipher stuff. And it kind of can give you insight on how maybe you're not doing it that way. Or maybe you could, you could do it that way and it would enhance your shit, you know? Right. It's so important, man. You can get stuck in a fucking bad place with bad friends. Are you freaking out? No, not freaking out. I'm just enjoying the entire experience led Zeppelin's on the wall. We've got this new studio for the folks who are just listening on iTunes. If you, uh, go to Ustream. Dot. TV Ford Slash Joe Rogan, you could watch all these now and uh, we actually have it set up where we have fucking TV on delay. Yeah. Weird. Huh? I should not look in that direction.

Speaker 4:          00:14:24       I did that for you, so you can, you know, it'd be one of my favorite stat hopes stories that I tell is when you and I did mushrooms and then we, uh, went out to the desert and it was the day the war started watching pregame for the war. I'll never, I'll never forget this. You and I were sitting in young Urban's living room, twisted to our balls, right? And they had a fucking giant kettle of some kind of Iowasca. They were trying to produce this, how many of them as scary and it give us just a weird feeling and ahead. It didn't get us off at all. Nothing. And I

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       had like, I felt like a pop or like I like, but I'll tell you what I bag of mushrooms in my pocket and then I'd come in and they have this whole fucking giant kettle going but the two of them together though, I think that's what really blasted it off. And you know, that's what they think Soma was. They think some of them might've been, you know, Soma for my ancient Hindu religion, they don't know what it is. But it was like the basis of a lot of their belief in a lot of their, their, you know, their, their ancient scriptures talk about it and like grieve about Soma and they think that it was, am Anita miscarry and mushrooms mixed with cubensis mushrooms like mixed like that. And that might have been because we were, we were fucking Alasta rude dude. We, I was, I remember staring at the wall and looking at this crazy geometric pattern of the universe was made out of and staying home, watching to the war.

Speaker 5:          00:15:41       It's like fucking, but you go, this is what you, you were standing there and you go, holy shit is fucking, what's his name? Frank Kelly Endo. Do it and deploying it in picks as I give you my pigs as John Madden who hasn't been relevant for fucking seven years. We're sitting there blasted, and I'll never forget this because you just go, Holy Shit, there's a fucking kick off kickoff to the kickoff. And we were, we were both like really just starting a trip, like it was just coming on and then you go, Holy Shit, there's a kickoff at six and we were sitting, we just sat down at 45 we, you get a cocktail of snacks. We sat down, we were like, Terry Bradshaw is going to fucking come on and tell you how he feels. It's like it's the strangest time ever to be alive. What kind of a world is this telling us? The war coverage begins at five. What are you saying? They timed it. You told me they timed it. They waited. Isn't it like a different time over there? So they waited all day and it's not like it was their time, but yeah, it was primetime here. Six in the afternoon to imagine if they actually timed the missiles to prime time in America. Probably had finally fucking date. Probably fucking fucking fucking advertisers. God.

Speaker 1:          00:17:04       Well you know George Bush if uh, yeah, three, three in the morning, you know their time. Yeah. Sizzler. We can get fucking tied to sponsor it. If you're going to, you know, new commit six who was such a strange fucking moment man. What a weird moment. Stand hope. Remember those two broads? I live next to you with a tall German chick that was lanky and Q and a short Brunette. And then there was the, the Chubby at CIC, sage member. The cello.

Speaker 5:          00:17:35       Oh those are the, yeah. You did like heroin or something with them or something off. I did everything. I stopped. I stopped the sages. The one I did like sage's father, I one time was the rolling stones'

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       manager. And what he did for this chick was he bought her a fucking blockbuster and Ventura blockbuster. And she said, I don't want to block. Turned her on to heroin. And she was herpes herpes. I didn't give him no fucking hurt because she was giving me shit about having, but she's over there and fucking Oh, heroin with Joey Diaz to me, I was homeless. So she would come to the store on Sundays. She would come to the store on Sundays and give me pills and she would, she was an expert in mixing. What was that shit? That was big year MDB a acts to see what white water she drinking, none of that other stuff. Oh, Ghp. And she bring it to the comedy store and I'd be hosting on Sundays and she'd give me drinks of the GSP, whatever the fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:18:46       So this happened, this one off for six months, she'd take HB and Sundays I go to a house broken, like go to a house on Sundays after I'd host, she come down, we buy coke from chewy. We'd go to Ralph's, we do heroin, eat her ass pills. She has to fake little shows that lingerie for me. She was a hundred pounds overweight, but this bitch ass, he want to eat. No, no, I didn't see it for a long time. Right. Then she started coming around to Calistoga, Tsp and so one fuck Liz is a great story. I just got him up cause I was thinking about staying hope on the way up here. And uh, our friend Mike was selling weed, but then one time he worked at CAA and he goes, listen, one of the interns older than me blew up. He ended up being Whitney Houston's manager and you know, and the tour manager and he's looking for powder.

Speaker 2:          00:19:38       So everyday they would come over and I would sell Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, you know, they would come over like $1,100, which was pretty diem money. I was taking Whitney's per diem money, right? Every day they come out with a little white envelope and give me the per diem money and I go up to the Martell cartel and I'd buy 14 grams of Blo. Take an eight ball out and cut it and then give it to Whitney Houston and they were fucking going crazy. They, this went on for 30 40 days, but I couldn't snort all the blog was, I couldn't store it. It was just too much. So I was giving it to Maldon Martinez, the whole, she's dead. That's the coke that killed her.

Speaker 2:          00:20:18       So I got, I got like two ounces of block plus I snorted all this coke and I can't smell it no more. I called him back. I go mountain, bring the club down to the fucking store. Right. I'm selling coke to Whitney fucking dad picking me up at nine in the morning, paging me on the Red Pager. I'm coming downstairs, getting in the car with them, going to the Martell cocktail to the brothers going in the house with two grams of coke already cut my pocket. And I would just go and take rocks out, throw the cut and mix it up and give it right back to them, the car, and they'd be happy as shit. They were invited me to a and m records to come party with them. I don't party. I was selling them. I was getting him a half ounce and taking an eight ball out and throwing an eight ball to cut it.

Speaker 2:          00:21:02       What does an eight ball? Three and a half grams. I haven't done coke my entire fucking life and I don't know like a percentage, like what it cost. Percentages are. Isn't that crazy sleazy that it's all cut though with a fucking shit like coke because someone goes, Hey, do you want to do a bump? And you go, okay, but you don't know what he's never bought. When you go out with Stan, hope somebody got cokes, he'll do coke. You got an elephant tranquilizer. Stan hopes like to go. We don't give a fuck. The train's already running. I got nowhere to be tomorrow. Fuck it. We're here. We're ready. You know what? I got here and he said he had mushrooms. I'm like, what the fuck you don't. You should. This is the cock sucker and knocks on your door with rolling papers and no weed.

Speaker 2:          00:21:47       You know what I'm saying? Like I've got no rule like rolling papers. Next time you bring those fucking mushrooms with you and we could have been right here on this would have been a great fucking podcast not to listen. So I'm Robyn Whitney and Bobby Brown for a fucking month. I'm robbing that blow every day. I can't do it. I can't snort it fast. How much are they doing? They're doing a half ounce a day. This is why this is not this. No, this is not da. They're doing a half ounce a day, which is three ounces a week. Oh my God. And singing. What does that look like? Whoa. Announces like this, like a half ounce of weed. Like God, they're doing, they're doing one of those a day. Got Bobby Brown, his face twisted, and I was getting the shit that was flaky. So my gosh, right? I tell Marilyn and bring the would, well, aren't they?

Speaker 2:          00:22:35       Aren't they feeding and entourage at this point about coke? It's just those two. Oh, there's only so much coke left. All right, you gotta go. You gotta go. You gotta go. Right? So this went on so and salary and they called Maryland Martinez. I go, Maryland. Do me a favor, bring the blow to the comedy store cause I'm just going to sell it. And a kid after my set gives me a little Baggie with the bottom of it filled up like not even, not even two lines. And I put it in my pocket and I take it home. When I get home I do it. It's not coke, it's crank. So I'm on fire now. It's three in the morning. I'm in my house on fire. I got the coke kid who hasn't stopped shaking since. All right. I have the coke and the fucking car.

Speaker 2:          00:23:16       No, I'm not. I'm not bouncing. I have the coat in the car. I always do that shit. I have the coat in the car right. And I wouldn't bring it upstairs. I don't like coke in my house. So I would go down and do a little bump by five in the morning. You would always keep it in the car and the car ride height. I don't like, I don't like him. I don't want to be parents, but I don't like it in my house anyway. I never like coconut. It's just bad. I don't like it. I used to leave it outside on the rocks and somebody else's garage and then I'm would go in and do a bump and go back upstairs. So there's one night I got upstairs and the pages going off and it's sage and I said fuck it. Let me just bring the two ounces to our house, a blow.

Speaker 2:          00:23:53       And I brought, at that time it was like an ounce and a half and three quarters. This bitch picked me up at six in the morning with a case of Starbuck coffee in Canada, half a gallon of vodka. And we went back to the house and we did that whole package of blo heroin, Valliant and BMA a GSP. We did how many days? How many days? Whole days. One day afternoon I had to get Scott Wolfe, Josh moves, brother Frey though to come get me over by the directors guild. Oh my God. Two days I puked till Thursday. Jesus Christ is how sick I was. The fucking Houston's kept calling me and I'm like, fuck you motherfuckers. I'm out of commission. Right. So finally that next week was the grammys. This is the last time I seen them. I don't think I told you about this last time ever. I seen Whitney Houston.

Speaker 2:          00:24:41       I got a call on a Monday morning after the grammys at nine in the morning and they're like, it's your boy up. He would have to be come get me, and they pull up to my fucking house where I live by the YMCAs and it was the manager, Whitney Houston and Ricky Martin in the fucking back and they're all gone. They're gone from the Grammy's that jaw, all of them. Jaws are fucking going. Jack and I got in the car with them. I drive for the Martell caught tell him sitting there like, oh, I don't even know what drinking, and I just looked out the window. I was more paranoid than he was. I got in, bought it, brought it back to the college. That's the last time I fucking said, wow. She, they went out of town after that. They were here to sing. They were doing, this had to be 98 97 99 they would go with the soundtrack to this James Bond. I Wyclef Jean who just robbed half a fucking Haiti. That cock sucker. That's why I'm 80 you didn't see that he robbed his own fucking earthquake relief. Fun? No, that million dollar. Yeah, Bro. That's why I don't send it unless I see the guy on the street bleeding. I give them money. When you send $100 they get 30 of it. Did you steal my change jar in the late nineties probably did. Fucking change jar.

Speaker 2:          00:25:55       What's a change jar by the head changing bluejeans. Talking about Robert. Yeah. He was just thinking about the nineties where we lived on curse on it and there was a fucking change. Our Ego. That probably is fucking, I called you Joey jingles for awhile. No, no. I would never write change. Rob something. No, it was someone who just fucking calling a fucking cup of cheese. Yeah. It was just a weird thought. I smoked pot, which I never do. The fuck is wrong with you. I'm a professional. Yeah. Now I remember calling in Seattle. What time? I was opening up for a stay at home and I picked them up in an Rv. It was snowing in Seattle. Help. Weird chick copy Carol, who I stuck the fucking a little bit before Perez. He was around for that. He knew all about that shit. Seattle. He Brian, you shouldn't probably played copyrighted shit on the background like this.

Speaker 2:          00:26:55       No, I'm not just playing old shit. All right with that, I'm looking at all these images. Probably not fucking start defamation suits. That's a definition. It's Reiki. Fucking Martin waters is a two story would definitely, if it didn't fucking happen, they wouldn't give it up. You Martin clean and sober now he came out of the closet, has got kids. So he'll look these opinions and stories and not a representative of the Joe Rogan and all that. What the fuck is, I was actually promoting copyrighted stuff and what is the [inaudible] on this story might think that you, the vigils date, the bucket on this story's going to get on the Internet.

Speaker 2:          00:27:32       Years ago wasn't, he wasn't going to say to me, no, you remember be bitch the fuck sing bitch St lets us, I kept her alive for three fucking months given all those rob Tam rocks and shit. So you think it was just them doing that amount? Joe Rogan, if you could go crazy, you got a check that's sucking your dick ain't got no experience with this. Fuck you want, I don't, I don't have any experience. We have a fucking shame. Jesus Christ. No, no, no. I just noticed the fucking, all the change had been taken out and nothing else was stolen. I go, who would do that? And I go, I think Joey's back on drugs. Maybe you fucking psycho. Oh, it's impossible. Joey. You might've done it. Forgot about it. I think the last time I went to stay in hope sound like I had an open house policy.

Speaker 2:          00:28:22       He had an open house policy. Still do. Like who would just like, I was just going, this is the fucking like 1996 we were all broke. I'm going, which one of my friends would be broken off to just fucking, I ever thought of you. I was at the coach and horses dangles out of my fucking mind and I couldn't walk to uh, Vista. So I went to standalone was cause he had the open door policy. And I go to stay in hopes, I hope with go. He's got the bunk beds. I get no, this time it was the living room. He just had a cut. I get out of the car cause I couldn't even make it to the fucking bed. That's like there's an earthquake and I wake up to the house and they opened my eyes sideways and I see the clock. So I'm focusing on the clock, but the fucking earth is moving, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 2:          00:29:05       And that was just, that's I think the last time I was. Do you still have that apartment? It's subsidized. You have somebody's rent control I to fuck. I still live there all the time. I still beat the horn when I go by like a motherfucker. I respect that Hennigan's there now town. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you ever Miss La? Yeah. Now. Yeah. Right now the fucking drive here was horrific. I was going to change. I was trying to get ahold of you. If we have to do this the next day I'm going to change my flight. I'm like I can just fly. I can fucking 10 days off. I'll just fly of fucking somewhere.

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       I never do that. Just fly somewhere for a vacation. I had my passport in Costa Rica. If I'm going to extend my stay here to fucking hang out with you, I'll probably be fucked up when I leave. Why not? And then just the thought of lax fucking ruined that entire fantasy. Really? Oh, sorry. He's going to talk down here. No, it was perfect. All right. That's fine. Well, my audio functions are way fucked. Oh yeah. Um, medicinally. You know what I'm, why did you move there in the first place? Why did you decide to, you live in Bisbee Arizona in the middle of nowhere, right? What was the, just wanted to get away and Paul's by ice, the place I've found when I was driving on the road, I really impulse buy. Yeah. I don't even see the inside. Did you know anything about the town pictures? Did you know anything about the town? I had been there a lot. Sorry. I had a fucking, it's fine dude. Yeah, yeah. No.

Speaker 1:          00:30:37       Alright dude. Dude, dude, dude, dude. [inaudible] so, um, yeah. So what's the downside? What's the downside of living in a tiny little town like that? Cause you're in like a town of like what? 6,000 people or something crazy. Yeah. Jake Lamata has come over to that house a couple times. Jake Lamata the fighter. Yeah. Really? Yeah. The Guy who they made the movie regionally bull about. What's that guy like? Uh, you know what? I could do a fucking 20 minute bit. That's the downside. Like he, he lives there. Yeah. Yeah. No, but you have to be respectful of people there because any good story that comes out of there, of course your neighbor. That's the downside to living in a small team. Yeah. You can't talk about half the fucking stop sign because they cut you off. Cause that guy will be behind you in line it fucking Safeway.

Speaker 1:          00:31:31       Yeah. Like how often you run in the same people over and over again. All the time. All the time. Yeah. That's a weird thing, huh? I go, yeah. You get a fucking really funny fucking bit about your neighbor. So do you guys think that Joey is take care of this change real quick? No, I don't think she didn't see there's this spot. Here's a spot on the microphone. If I was, it doesn't matter. I was looking for it like I was to your voice on where do you want not to me. Not to you really? It sounded fucked. I think it's probably those headphones. No, no. Yeah, no. It's because of my senses are peaked. Right? So what's the good side? There's gotta be a good side. You know, I fucking love it. One of the bad sides is I eat the road now because I want to be home. Really? And now you have a lot of friends fucking joy in Cleveland. Like what am I going to accomplish that I haven't in 21 years? Same thing. I'm going to fuck bro. Soft cock at a younger girl all night until she's diluted enough. What are we going to do with fucking triple run? Let's do a triple run old school. Take red band. The drive. I'd fucking love to do that. We did our 10 year anniversary. Yeah. Becker and I, when we did, you know, 10 years

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       from now we're going to go back and we were going to do a Tribble run triple runs are these legendary one nighters in the northwest. I forget where on radio we should probably eat fucking entertain or some no, this isn't attaining. Oh yeah, yeah. But uh, uh, so you'd go, you'd play Idaho falls. That's where I met Joey Coco Diaz Dribble Gig. I was in boulder, Colorado was a host at the boulder broker, the joker broker, the joker broker and he came out on a Tuesday and the ride driver's license for a long time because I would live down the road. I didn't have a home, was the fucking joker brokers address in Boulder, Colorado. I got a Colorado license, Kessler, Mike Kessler's house. You bought the car from my Kessler. Oh, that's right. Piece of shit. That's right. You bought, yeah. That fucking dodge neon forever. Jay Morph fucking, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:33:29       Spotted me in the, uh, parking lot of the comedy store in the late nineties and said, ah, dodge neon. Yeah. He had some condescending thing where I'm good for the environment or so what a cunt that guy is. But we met Olga. Broker run was Tuesday in boulder, then you had Wednesday off and then you had Thursday in Craig, Colorado Friday and uh, some other Gunnison and it ended up in Colorado Springs at some fucking bond. So Tuesdays you had to come to boulder and I became friends with Doug and then Wednesday you had off. So it was going to happen with stay at a hotel. He stayed at my house. That's when my wife and I first broke up was a Congo. That's when I first met him. He was still telemarketing in Vegas the second time he came back, it just done evening at the Improv.

Speaker 2:          00:34:13       Yeah. Yeah. And you stayed again. And that's how we became friends. I didn't see him again. He Won San Francisco and he came up to Seattle and then I thought, well it's fun when you go on one of those gigs and you meet a real comic, you know, cause he, you never know what Joey, Joey came into the joker broker. He was like the house, but he didn't give a fuck. You're like, hi, I'm the comic, and he's like, I know, and he goes on stage. I just had the fucking push me pull you like that's it. That's how I remember he was doing a bit about having the shits and the vomits at the same time, but you knew it was honest because you can tell by Joey's face. He was fucking sick person. He was like sweating profusely and it was about having the push me pull you shit, trying to figure out which end to aim towards the toilet.

Speaker 2:          00:35:02       I got $50 a show and I would pull you, I would take a hundred valiums and sell them all for $3 a piece and I would make $50 a show on a steak. It was steak tonight and I had to go up every Tuesday for the same 80 people and do new material every fucking Tuesday, so I'd have to get the bolt of paper and write five minutes and no place to practice. I didn't know about that. I thought you just wrote it and brought it up. They're like, you know, and it was the same people. And I remember that if you got them to lift their head up while they were cutting into the state, that they just paid six 95 four, you know, those type of people. That was their thing on Tuesdays to comics and the state for $14

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       or whatever the fuck it was. You know. But it's amazing how, that's how I got into comedy. If you could get them to look at you, you did your job and get a Gig once from Mike Clark, Clark's brother Mike Clark is a great guy. Lenny Clarke is one of the legendary comedians of Boston, a fucking awesome guy. And Mike used to book me on a lot of road gigs back in the Boston days and one of them, he booked me. It was the waiting room of a restaurant. So it was as your people are waiting to be seated, they have like a room where they all sit down. I don't know why they didn't just make that part a part of the restaurant too. It was real weird. But they had a band and then they had a comedian. So these people are just sitting around waiting and you can just go up and start talking about blowjobs and taking shits or whatever stupid act I had at the time.

Speaker 4:          00:36:22       And as I'm talking like I'm in the middle of a bit, right about the hit the punchline and over the PA system that I'm using, it's like Johnson Party of two, your table's ready, please come to the front desk. And I'm like, oh no. It was the same sound system. So every time when you were on stage you could be in the middle of talking and they would just start announcing people's names and it would happen like every 15 seconds. It was the most ridiculous Gig of all time. And I replaced a host that was a magician that came out with a bird on stage, but the bird will, we get stuck on the lights and he would shit on.

Speaker 5:          00:36:55       So they had a fire him. That's who I replaced. That's how my, that's how my comedy career and I'll never forget when I seen the parrot or whatever, it was shit on him. I went right to the manager on my dog. Cause you've got the hosting job was the winner of the, of the Beck's comedy competition. Beck's beer. Right. And that's how I want the more popular than that brand of beer right now. What happened there? Beer. How can that be? We're never caught on, I still, I still drink Becks. Yeah. Some stanky to it backs. It was like a little, if they're out of Heineken you'll get it back out again. Yeah, I'll take it. But you just make it tastes like Heineken. Remember honey brown. It was really popular and like the like nine early nineties you were a kid. What do you think sells more bex or Heineken.

Speaker 5:          00:37:43       Heineken. Right. I think it got commercials running. Is that what it is? I guess so. That's got a lot of commercials do. I haven't seen banks. I've been out of bex in forever. Maybe I'm just prejudice. Maybe I need to drop the bags. Go get me a bag. You are pretty prejudice with beer though. I've noticed just from being in comedy clubs, you're always like, what the fuck is that? Why aren't you drinking that? You've got to get man's beer. Like Sam Adams just started drinking those little light fairy drinks. I'm like, that's not really a beer. Goddammit. I tried to give me a fucking light beer outta here, bitch. No light beer, Sam Adams beer that I like his ass. Fuck yes. They light up a mass. Stella's and uh, saint man, Yo, we're going to handle the mass. And it was at the club night grilled 93. Oh yeah. And then so there's three at that time I

Speaker 2:          00:38:35       hadn't followed Joey d. No, no, no. It is on fire. There's a, there's always nobody with a mullet. Oh, please. And he went up on stage in the middle of his set as a priest walked by and stand hopes. He's in my little corner of his eye and he goes, hey father, where are you going? I got a tip. Fuck Joe going to blow your fucking socks off the whole fucking room. Like just shit. The priests just ran out of that motherfucker Maguire. That's who it was. I think that that might've been who I, cool. I call, I call me you and Chris Mcguire and beer joing at that dot. I'm good. We did. The priest was there with my dad that we did at [inaudible] on Friday night, but we did grow 93 on Saturday night. That's where I end up that way. Or not monster fucking, I was booed off stage.

Speaker 2:          00:39:22       I got booed off stage where I followed a Jim brewer wants yeah. Nanuet New York. I think it was maybe not manual it somewhere somewhere in the uh, outside of New York. It was humiliating. Died, died, a brutal, horrible death. I didn't, I didn't know how to get myself out of a bad mindset back then. And if I, if anything happened bad during the day, if I got in a fight with a check, anything that went wrong, I could spiral on stage. Like I can do good, I can hold it together. But I really had no business headlining and brewer was having good sets all week. We're both having good senses,

Speaker 4:          00:39:57       fun crowds. But on the last show on Saturday night, it was a late show and the crowd was fucking drunk and he felt he fucking killed. And I was standing backstage and I, this is one of my manager had just convinced me to start dressing nice. So I was wearing like club pants, I'm wearing like a nice pair of slacks and some nice shoes and I looked like the most unfunny fuck on earth and I knew it and I felt it like I'm like dressed like this fucking stylish douche bag and I'm going to go on stage and I don't dress like this. This is not how addressed if I was hanging out with my friends, like this is not comfortable, this is a fucking the close of an asshole. And so I felt a backstage, I was like, Shit. I'm like, I can't be thinking like this.

Speaker 4:          00:40:44       I can't be thinking that I shouldn't be dressed like this, but I couldn't help it. And I might, knee was fucked up at the time. I had just gotten my ACL, just tore. I hadn't had the surgery yet, so I couldn't move good on stage. If I moved funny one way or another, my leg would pop out. So I had all this shit in my head like, oh, what if my knee pops out? Fuck, I don't feel funny. And I went on stage and just a dick. I mean, every joke that came out of my mouth, I didn't know how to say it right. My timing was off. I was panicking. And the worst part about it was this dude fucking in the crowd goes, man, you're not fucking funny. And I couldn't say anything to him. I couldn't say anything to him. Cause I know he's right. You know, all I can say to him as you're not helping, this is not helping, you know? But there's nothing in that, you know, just pointing out that he's an asshole. He knows he's an asshole. He thinks

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       he's entitled to be an Asshole. He paid to see my shitty act, you know? And, uh, that was a huge learning point for me, man, about the mindset that you have to have when you go on stage, when you're young and you're, you know, your life is in disorder and you go on stage like that, you could have a goddamn tailspin over, you have to accomplish to a mom and one and at the FEC rank addressed the fucking elephant in my head. Oh Shit. I'm fucked. No, you're going to be fine by, listen, this isn't that. Joey and I are going to come with, all right. I'm going to come with Brian and I will come with the kit will come with you. I am. Fuck. We're going to be whatever you past that. I don't smoke pot. You're on mushrooms, power mushrooms. Oh God.

Speaker 2:          00:42:30       What do you expect? Just throw out a quick disclaimer. A smoke a second. That's how wide you motherfuckers got me. I really have no concept of fucking tired. Like I was still worried about it, man. Don't worry about, don't worry about it. Let it go. Talk to them like, this is what it seems like an okay, I'm going to help you right here. I'm gonna help you right here. You're tripping. I'm not, so let me take care of everything. You live on this weed. You're fine. The mushrooms, you're not afraid of. The weed is what's freaking out and there's more where that came from. Cox introspective juice, Bro. It taps you into the fucking nature of the universe. He's just getting out the fucking problems that I had my head and then we'll, I'll be fine now. I just wanted to say, I really don't have any concept of time right now.

Speaker 2:          00:43:16       Good, good. That's good. I got it. Well then I had to just yet. So you can good. You set it so that now it's my responsibility. I'm going to get you to your show. Who you're working with tonight. I'm not worried about anything, but I want you to not thought out because I was looking at you kind of melting, like wanting to say, but I didn't want to interrupt. Your story is a fuck baby. Look at me with these glasses on. So I'm not fucking 22 fucking kicking on the couch saying and called nine one one. Stan hope. And I did the weird thing. I had to get out of my standup and I did DMT and Stan hope went into like almost like a semi seizure. And uh, it was the only time I'd ever been right. Anybody who did DMT. Yeah, that's what you, when you came out, but before you came out of it, you were moaning manual like this and it was like you got knocked out dude. It was the same sound that a guy makes when he gets brutally knocked out. When a guy just gets fucking smashed. They have this [inaudible] guy last night, the ultimate fighter. The first fight. I didn't see the fights last night. Fucking spoiler alert, Joey. Well, I don't know who it happened to, so thanks for not saying the names, but a, I'm a, I'm going to go check it out tonight. This weekend, man. I wish you could come around this weekend. Busiest weekend. Dot. My rarest common [inaudible] come

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       to the fights. Are He's coming? Is he a working with Damo? Rare in Vegas? No, no, he's just coming down to see the fights and there's a perfect, you know dom, I ray was really good at pool and don my rare play and I play pool. Sometimes we're going to go watch some professionals gamble. There's this thing called the action report.com and they have like professional pool players and they have these big high level gambling matches where they all pool together like 50 a hundred thousand dollars and you know like the buy in is usually like $10,000 each guy and then they bet a bunch of money on the side. Brian, that shit is really distracting. I'm trying to put something on and just drag a light side distracting. Is this Joey's breathing like Darth Vader. I was an opiate Anthony the other day and I was listening to, it was in my car and Bobby Kelly, he's like show, what are you fucking breathing? What's up with your breathing? And I didn't hear it when I was on the phone, but then I was listening to the radio. I have a stupid headset and it sits in front of my nostrils. So as you know, I'm talking to him.

Speaker 4:          00:45:31       I don't even realize I'm doing this. Like the whole camp. It was the most annoying fucking thing ever. So they're all you who are listening that day. I'm really sorry. I did not know that. I was making those annoying noises in the background. That's going to be some great fights this weekend and motherfucking next weekend. Yeah, absolutely. I Jon Jones but cheated. You got some John George Allen Burger gets Diego Sanchez. Eve Edwards versus El Kukui on Spike TV. Oh Shit. What about fucking Phil Davis Against Russia? They're finally doing that. You're going to Japan. I love and am at Bisping. It's going to be a crazy fight. Fight, fight. We agree. Fucking fat. I wish she were going to be there. Yeah, we'd go. Ari should is going to be there. The and gentleman and he's also going to be playing his famous Ra shift fear non UFC sponsored non UFC sanction. Hunt for the edible.

Speaker 4:          00:46:19       I don't know what that means, but uh, if you want to follow it and I have no connection to this whatsoever. Go Duh, Ra should fear on Twitter at a r I s h a f, F, I r and he may or may not be hiding. We'd play, sorry, I'm going to see on Fox are we showed up with a bag of Carmelo's are we always had is 29,000 edibles close by the other day I called my wife gets savage. I call him up. I can't believe I'm in traffic. Goes now, you know I always have weed in my car and he talked me into roll the joint on the four oh five he goes roller. Who gives a fuck? Smoke it. You rolled it while you're stuck in traffic. Yeah, it's beautiful wood. Fucking handle old school. You know what I like man, I don't mind being in my car and traffic.

Speaker 4:          00:46:57       As long as I got that hands free system, I could talk to people on the phone. It's not bad man. You have a conversation, you know, I have like a nice long conversations with friends. When you catch up, catch up, phone calls, you've been everybody's texting. That's all everybody does is text these days. You know the calls to calls to tax. It's like text is five to one, you know. Have you been doing any of the Syria Siri texting while you're in the car now? As soon as I found out that Siri goes to a fucking database, I just said, why am I doing this? Yeah, everything you do goes to a database. And I was like, I don't like talking about that fucking shit that we were talking about this another thing. Yeah. Well you know, apparently that was in a I o s um, the iPhone operating system, uh, for in a diagnostic mode only back in the day, but it's not in it like android phones.

Speaker 4:          00:47:41       What John, Bryan and I are talking about some new thing that came out. What is it called? Iq Client Iq. Client. Is there a reason why they say it's in there? They have, they really, I don't think anybody's figured it out yet. It's just been recently discovered and what it is for the folks who don't know what the fuck we're talking about when you buy an android phone. Doug, Stan, hope you have an android phone now. All right. You're fucked up. You should have went iPhone. I know you tried to be a nice contrary and go against the tide. I W I got what? They use a window. Go get her to those things I can fucking see. So I don't have to put on reading glasses. Well they apparently, every time you send a text it logs it in a database somewhere. It's stores.

Speaker 4:          00:48:20       He prays every, every number you practice, everything you do is logged in a database somewhere. My girlfriend doesn't get on the line much. So will you tell him that's not even it do this Joe wrote? No, no, it's not that. I don't think it's that. It's been proven and that's where it gets interesting. It's not that I don't think other people have done it. I mean, I think the FBI and the CIA has been trying to do this, trying to have the ability to spy on people. And you know, the argument is, well, if you know doing wrong, what are you worried about? Yeah, but that's not the point is it can be done. So it will be just so he could get doors database like, yeah, but it's, and then manipulate that. That's a qualification, that argument, that argument. Like if you're not doing anything wrong, what are you worried about it?

Speaker 4:          00:49:00       But that's a shit argus in your fucking life. They shouldn't be then finding, let me film you poop. I want to see how much you do. You look at the paper is, you're not doing anything wrong. Let me do it. Let me watch them. I want somebody to know how many times did do happy faces, you know, or stupid stuff like that. I do happy faces all day. What's wrong with that? Are still stuck in their business. At the other end of this fucking wire, there's the human being that does that and he'll be dead with all that information we give. So it's not that man. You know what the real picture is? It's not that. The real picture is, is that we're losing all of our secrets and it's going to come to a point in time where there will be no secrets at all.

Speaker 4:          00:49:41       Yeah, absolute honesty. But yeah, it was like you can't fight this. It is a compelling thought, but it's, you know, everyone's terrified of it because it's being controlled by a group of us. It's by one, one, one group of the population, the people who, you know have this information that's being controlled by them. And we don't like the idea of anybody having any control over any of us because we know it's natural human nature to want to dominate people. So when you see something like this and it was just a database that records everything, you're fucked. That's inevitable, right? I mean if this is the direction that it's going, if you look at like just how interconnected everybody is with Facebook now and you know, you just look at like, that's a reason Twitter, it's going in, going in that direction. The person in the cubicle next to you is now a celebrity because she can ego surf herself and go, Yo, I can candy Stouffer is

Speaker 5:          00:50:27       a fucking cunt. She talks too loud and her breath smells like, yeah. That's just because the fucking person next to you in the cubicle that you bitch at every morning is Facebooking about you. So yeah, and you could get famous where with one fucking youtube video, you're going to have one youtube video you put up there and you can get famous and you'll be as famous as the next youtube video unless you, you're really good at. But that's a good thing. Yeah, it is a good thing. The whole thing is amazing. It's remembering clear channel. Yeah. Just the word struck. Fear of the, of what? A fucking corporate, I don't even know if they exist anymore, if it does. Well, because there's, this is what matters. Yeah. Podcasts. What people, I was about to dump serious because, but now you're getting a show on Sirius, but on Sirius for awhile.

Every weekend we're on the opiate Anthony Channel. I wish we had just announced the opie and Anthony Chao. We should get free passes from serious. At least we could give Doug a free year, right? Yeah. We pay for our own serious talk. Good about serious here. But uh, yeah, it's fun. Cool. I love the fact that you can be in the car. Like I and I listened to series every day. I listen to OPA Anthony basically every day riding fas and I listened to the news.

Speaker 5:          00:51:56       There's a lot of good talk radio stations. I have this built in thing. I can't get the XM things for some reason. Really? Why is that? Well, maybe I haven't. No, you can't. You can't now either. Maybe you just need to up your prescription. CNN, BBC music on my fucking presets.

We're gonna do, we're going to do a, um, um, a Vegas show in February around like Superbowl time. Yeah, we're going to do another way to the Mandalay bay, a big one. A. Does anyone in the UFC did any of the fight areas? Not like you? I get along with pretty much everyone. Yeah. I don't have any problems with it. If I do what I always straighten it out. It's, you know, it's a difficult thing when you're criticizing people. Exactly. That's

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       fuck out of you. And you're criticizing them about their ability to beat the fuck out of each other and you gotta go, look, man, I'm not saying I can do it better than you because that's the automatic presumption. I'm just saying this is what you're doing wrong. I can see it. The WHO's fighting for that soup bowls a Saturday. Who? Who's fighting the Superbowl earlier? Did you set, this thing's not finding the fucking guy from the show again in Bisping's fight and ma'am. Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh No. I thought I heard a different name. Like, no, they're fighting and they're fighting this weekend. This is a fucking huge fight for Ma'am and for, you know, for Bisping this, you know, it just brings him into like top contender status. If he beats mayhem, you know, he's, he's right up there with everybody else. Bam.

Speaker 2:          00:54:06       Have credits other than the stupid, yeah, fraudulent VH. It wasn't fraudulent. They there was irresponsible perhaps, but a fraudulent from a, just a viewer's level like, Oh yeah, they have a beef and they're gonna Change Cock sucker. That's a change I don't see. I'm on the UFC small. They don't have the super bowl as big as it. That's how big is it? It's more of a jar. She don't have the Superbowl card up here, unfortunately. We can all talk about Joey jingles. Watch your fucking change jar people. What's he goes, that's your new nickname? Only until we jingle. The only time I got in trouble I was feel change out of cars and shit. Which one? That was on open. Miker opened micro and I sold cars and at night I was living in the city and I needed a change to get back over the fucking bridge. We'd steal quarters or dimes to get a doll 35 or something, but this is, it was one of those periods and this shit, this is what you always have to worry when when when your friends are telling you they don't do drugs, that's when you worry about them. When they are fucking doing heroin. Fucking sage all night. That's a guy you can trust, right? It's the guy. No, I cleaned up Jay. Just do you need anything?

Speaker 2:          00:55:32       You need me to house sit while you're gone. I cleaned up with some fucking crazy times. They'll just some crazy fucking times, man. It really don't. Hollywood Joey jingles thing is like young Hollywood doing. I hope he's not really fast, crazy days. A weird thought that came into my head, but I remember being at the coach, coach, coach, coach and horses. Yeah. Coked up to the point where I couldn't talk. Looking to my left and seen James Gamble Feeney there with two of the hottest fucking blondes. You ever seen your life ready to get? His Dick sucked looking at me and he's is whacked up as I am looking at me and be looking at him going to be fucked up with that friend of yours. The girl, I mean that was me and Hedberg went in there as when he lived on Syrah, Beneatha's fucking staying on his couch and we went in there as like a like a day

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       or we were day Jerry like we always walked past and it's right up the fucking street, but then they realize how cool it was and the no one was in there. There's, they had this bartender named ginger ginger. It was like fucking, it's throw momma from the train, you know Mama, she was that fucked up and she was like, and she was covered in the liver spots or rank sores or whatever. No, she fucking, they booted. This is all fucking nineties but yeah, they, they've, she had been a bartender there for, since its heyday before. Wow. You know how dive bars go then they go through. So they couldn't fire her in those old alcoholic random, but she, she was like, she threw a blind guy out of the bar for having a dog. They go guards. And then the regulars that knew her were trying to explain no, it's a seeing eye dog. He's a boy. He's blind. I don't care. No dogs. Wow. Like horrific fucking human being. You'd be sitting in it, sit at the bar and, and you, your drink is out and I, good.

Speaker 1:          00:57:37       No one was listening to me so I just got thrown off the sound of Joey's breathing and the silence together. It was just starving for what? You'd have an empty drink and she'd go out, ed and I did like and, and people would say, uh, no, I'm good right now. And you go, this isn't a bus stop. Wow. Like there was, that's why there was no one in there. But then you'd fucking, next thing you know you're doing it was Quintin Tarantino at they were doing is me and like Hedberg and Quentin Tarantino and that's it in this dive shit hole did it. It's closed now, right?

Speaker 2:          00:58:10       Yeah. It's when we play, the place is closed, but we still get tennis rackets and play time pictures of it. Yeah. We haven't Hedberg. And what was the kid with the long hair from Seattle? I was an Ireland doing comedy and he was Shard Hogan. Oh my God. All those guys. And then say Fulton Day full. Yeah, he's staying home. How to rent a car that was in front of his house. Again, you could just jump in it and drive it whenever you need it. But the gas gauge was broken. I got busted one time as Santa Monica. Sam is sent day. I'd fucking rush hour because you know, you're just getting a car. I have an audition standup. I'm in a bind. Take the car, boom, getting a fucking car ran out of gas. Oh my God, don't fucking is the gas gauges broken fucking idea. Another night, Stan hope is out of town or something like that, and he goes, take the cost. So lean. And so he goes, take the car and just bring it to stand hopes in the morning. I parked it on sunset. They've fucking toe it. The whitening of $200 for the white via tended to fucking motor. When you lived in Venice in that house that was painted like the American flag

Speaker 1:          00:59:19       painted and right after nine, this giant as a duplex and they, it was fucking giant stars in the fucking stripes.

Speaker 2:          00:59:29       Oh, so, so super bowl weekend is a Diaz versus Saint Pierre. That's what it is. Shit. Yeah. I don't know if a saint peers fully repaired those repair. He had an injury he had from listing to Diaz healed. The fucking thing just yielded. I hope so. A lot of other fights or Carlos condit. Josh Cox. Let's stop fucking talking like fans and talk like men. We don't watch GSP for his knees. All right. Oh, keep wearing those tight fucking shorts. I love you motherfucker. You suck that he shaved.

I still talk about that. My Act sale. It's then, well this cat died, so she had a wig for the cap that you put a little towel and she put the fucking towel and she had all the cats sit around the dead cat and look at them and express their condolences. To the guy and I told Mrs [inaudible] was the stay at home. She goes, look at them. They love the categories. Then little love this sitting around and going, I need that. And that way I think that tail, because everybody was busy. Something my mother was great, was a cat, was missing a leg that belonged to mrs family. Fuck it. That leads me into plugging to December 10th, December 10th Tucson fucking Joey Diaz has he shown up. Shawn Rao says he showed us what we already have. Brendan,

Speaker 1:          01:01:28       Brendan Walsh, Brody Stevens, Saturday, December 10th. What does it offer yet? The reality though, theater in a Tucson. Oh no, sounds awesome.

I got that surgery. I'd have fucking umbilical hernia. So I just put on my website as a joke. Is it? Uh, yeah. Uh, I have this, I described the problem is that it's a belly button hernia, which is your fucking intestines pouring your guts. Oh my God. But the fatter and older I got, the more pronounced it became and people are like, you got to get that check. Anyway, I put on my website, I'll give you a, if

It's going to put you under and opioids out fucking w wilds and whites of West Virginia. Fucking oxycotton. I can fix anything kind of surgery. It was a respectful dot. No, they were anesthesiologists that were fans and you look like Robert Deniro at some points and I'm trying to fucking ignore a lot of things that are going on in my head. Which Robert Deniro, the Cape Fear One. I don't know your fucking heads just does that naturally. Kind of twisting out of control, dude, dude, dude, dude.

Speaker 5:          01:03:07       Dude, that's so funny. So hope story all going to be groovy. Yeah. This the story. Who knows? Could be anything. What? Any idea what his story was about. I can't remember. Something about Ralphie may make it out with your mom. That's right. Yeah, I know. That's what it was supposed to. It's where I was supposed to go. Yeah. What was I fucking, was I talking about my mother? No, I think, I think Joey Diaz just did one of those things where he just ran out and it's like, oh, I might drop this bomb and run flux. Your head up. So important man. This guys like him. So important. It's so important. And you meet dudes that are just out there on the fringes. We were randomly talking about this last night or this morning about like people that you know that are funnier than any comics, you know, they fucking die.

Speaker 5:          01:03:56       There's that. Oh, comedy lost a massive, no, that was a funny dude at a bar I have. I have so many people I know that how many a lot of things and they just never get into stand up. But my manager is funnier than me and I know it fucking destroys it. Really genuinely brilliant and funny and my manager's funny. My business manager's funny. My business manager as funny as comics are funny, he can be a comic, he can eat, they can easily, both of them could have been comics if they want it to be. Yeah. I know a lot of people that could have been comics. There's a lot of them, you know, and it's, it's a funny thing. It's who decides to take that road? Who decides not to. Same, but you know those people that could have done it. Man, they're the same type of people to be around.

Speaker 5:          01:04:41       You know, some of the, the guys that used to hang out with at the pool, funniest fucking human beings I've ever met. They're just, they're just derelicts gambling junkies and they're just wild motherfuckers just due to, they weren't fitting in into some nine to five suit job. It wasn't working out for them. And it wasn't even like comics where comics tried to say something funny on purpose. Exactly. Funny people. Exactly. They're not working on it right now. Working on a bit. Yeah. Joey Diaz just fucking, I mean, come on. What is cliche is, yeah, you may a phone book, but he's that funny. Do you remember the early days when dudes would actually try bits on you? That's the worst. Oh yeah. No, I still get it. I do it all the time.

Speaker 6:          01:05:21       You do it all the time to people? Uh, I don't do, I don't like it. It's not a bit, it's something I think of that it's funny and I'm just like, oh, I'll just say it out loud to see if I think it's fun. Everyone thinks it's funny or if you know, but it's not like I'm, I've been writing this bit for many, many weeks and I can't, you know what I mean? Like it's more, it's something I just thought of maybe like that minute, you know, you're not sure they

Speaker 5:          01:05:39       try it out on people. I don't really, I don't think about trying it out loud. If you're saying, hey listen, I'm working on this bit. Do you have any ideas? They'll, he'll just fucking forced me. I won't even say what city because cause he'd know. But there was a comic like a old, like fucking 30 some plus years in the business in the green room. Hey, haven't seen you in so long. You haven't worked out. And he's starts telling me I can give it away with that voice I now know is knowing you. You probably know. Yeah, no, it's, no, no, no. I am I talking, I'm fucked up. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Black British. Sorry. So happy. I'm targeting this. Oh, sorry. Anyway, no, no, I'm good. I'm good. I'm going to fucking power through this up. Oh yeah. So he is fucking rifts.

Speaker 5:          01:06:33       All these jokes, but that bad, like from the new Eh, as trying to my station, but he's doing a guest set and then goes immediately from the green room and has the exact same conversation we just had in the green room as a set. Oh, you know what he did? He just ear fucked you. He just made you sit and listen to his sets so he could warm up. That's what he did. It was, I mean, it was almost immediate. Like, Hey, wow, perfect for him. He's like, if I can get it off in front of Stan, hope probably be fine. But it was someone I've known for like, yeah, but he doesn't care. Here's is, here's these people that are basically almost sociopathic. You know, their, their desire to succeed, desire to like do well on stage supersedes everything, supersedes being a human, you know, and they don't care if they just use you to get their shit off and practice before they go onstage.

Speaker 5:          01:07:22       Stage in my friend, I'm gonna practice on you. You know, your friends suck my Dick. They just in the mouth, they're just ear fucking you instead of fucking your mouth. They're fucking your ear. Like they want to get off on your mouth. They can't fin again had the uh, their talk blockers talk bloggers. I was Christian Finnegan. That's a good way of putting it. Yeah. There's people that just want to talk at you, man. That's the cocaine effect. I don't know what that is, but I've noticed, you know, I'm, I'm very ignorant to the effects of cocaine. The only, the only insight that I have is the one time that you and I drank that co, that Mata de cocoa tea. It was the same, same time that we, the whole day of the war. Oh yeah. All right. And I remember saying, I can't shut the fuck up.

Speaker 5:          01:08:03       Like I got a real problem. I cannot shut the fuck up. I'll give you, I'll give you an analogy that might work. You know when you're like you're writing really well. Yes. And you're like fucking I, I this to Bingo. You fucking just be with me cause it, my head's going faster than I can write and I just bounce ideas off of her on PR. That's the cocaine is like where you're fucking okay, I'm rapid cycling. No, you need to hear this. Cause my fucking brains going. And so, but it's two people doing that at the same time and it's all fucking pointless. And it's a bad note book. It's in organic. Yeah. Well his Adderall, the medium then, cause a lot of people that are on Adderall day, they, they mean, but what is it, what's the difference between the cocaine high in a speed high?

Speaker 5:          01:08:47       Well I know Adderall is very much a lot like cocaine. It makes me feel like I'm meeting getting drips because it just is like a constant reminder that it feels like I'm on cocaine and I, but wow. But it seems like it lasts longer and like where cocaine, you feel this like up and then like 15 minutes later sold web for me. Adderall. That just gives me anxiety. That's a long term. Like I don't, I, I liked the uh, the seller, what do you call it, the, the practice of doing coke. I like shopping up and doing a line is really romantic and if you do it in a fucking comedy, like the comedy store, Green Room of the, the main stage green room at the comedy store, just like, I want to chop up a ramp mirror. It's just kind of mirrors the weird piano.

Speaker 5:          01:09:37       It's hilarious. You do read Buller's like I can do. Yeah. Boom. Okay. I do a bump and I move on with my life. It's like fucking energy drink now. Yeah. Really? Wow. That's, it's, yeah, it's the, the whole act of it is, I was on the highway once, I was like 18 years old. I was with my friends, we were driving home and we were in revere. We're near a Kelly's roast beef. It's fucking really sketchy neighborhood with a great place to get fried clams. And, uh, as we're driving, we see this car beside us and the people in the backseat had the light on. They had the dome line on and they were doing coke and the girl looks over at me. I looked at her and she'd just come the fuck, she just looks at me and has this fucking evil look at her face.

Speaker 5:          01:10:22       Fuck you. And I'm like, Whoa, how to know. All I did was look over at you, caught you doing coke and she's gone. And I was like, okay. So, but it was weird how a little thing like that will scare you off of it. Yeah. There was that. The first time I did acid, I puked. We lived in a Vegas. We're, uh, I lived with this family where I'll like renting from her, but there was kids in the fucking, they'd play basketball in the driveway every day and like, you know, eight to 12 years old every day. The first time I did acid, we took it and I'm having a fun time and I'm like, this is fucking good. And then we went back in for a second hit and I put the acid on my tongue and then we walked back out into this. I'm fucking tripping hard and there's a bunch of kids, little kids playing basketball and someone threw me

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       the basketball. So I inhaled still had the paper on my tongue and it stuck to the fucking cliteracy in the back of your throat. So I puked into my mouth

Speaker 1:          01:11:25       in front of kids were, but I'm consciously thinking I don't want to lose the hit of acid that I just put. So I'm, I have a mouth full of puke trying not to. So I tried to swallow the Puke, which makes you puke way harder than anything else. Oh. So I just, I extreme vomit in front of all these horrified children. It's four in the afternoon and I start picking through the BW cause I, so I don't want to listen. I don't want to lose that hit of acid. Oh my God. I found the acid in my previous work it off and my beer neck. What are you even still work? The, the, the looks on the faces of the children where some guy, your neighbor Guy Kinda guy is coming out and now he's rummaging through his own vomit the afternoon. Oh, such a beautiful image and that might queer those kids off and do an acid is my point. I, you know what? Yeah, much like you are queered off coke from a finger stick. Some men and a mullet rummaging through his vomit on its side street in Vegas. Oh my God. That might make you think it was one of the best nights of my life. Did you tell us it was one of the fucking trip was still legendary like yeah, just from eating. Did you think when you put it back in your mouth it, it hit you harder?

Speaker 1:          01:12:53       Oh boy. It was a second hit. The point is the, no, we, it was my first time tripping so I was already on one hit and wanted more. Of course, let's do more.

Speaker 7:          01:13:04       Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:13:06       Yeah, that probably did queer them off. It probably just much. Is it okay to say queer, the Moffett? No, I'm just, I'm just so happy I remembered why I started this story is because you were talking about the cocaine and the woman. That seems like 40 minutes ago. It was a long time ago. Really? I'm so,

Speaker 8:          01:13:24       it was weird when you started taking a nap. Just right there. You took it like a little nap. Do you remember?

Speaker 1:          01:13:28       Did I drive some fucking with you? Don't. Don't do that Brian. Tell fuck with dudes that are tripping. All Con. That was not fucking, I'm sorry. All right, fellow settle though. Your cigarette went out. I never knew cigarettes went out. Yeah. Why? I guess I talked for a minute. I thought cigarettes just designed to burn a lot of this show that I was just sitting listening to in my car and I'm like, oh wait, I'm on at fuck. I got to talk. I was just a huge fan sitting back

Speaker 8:          01:13:55       Mac for a while in California, they actually have these new cigarettes where they stopped burning after a certain parts of California. We were talking about that like that was a fad, like childproof lighters, but it's a California thing. Well, I don't know if it's all California, if they just them for all cigarettes

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       by it so that people, when they flick them out their windows, they will go out and not pillow and catch a fire. Yeah, it seems like it would be. How did they do that? What kind of chemical is that? Who knows what the fuck they're putting in there anyway, the FDA food and drug administration as it is, they uh, they approved more than 500 different chemicals that are in cigarettes. Well that's fantastic for Philip Morris. Just put, did you buy stock more stock or the day my fucking accountant, the, you know, do some mobile your money or something so that he talks to you. Well know it is just accountant Brendan Walsh.

Speaker 5:          01:14:50       I would know it. That's how I hear it. It's just for trying to tell me about a rainy day. Like, am I actually said that to him? I go, I don't really have that much confidence in saving for later. So yeah, let's just keep it in the bank. Well, you can't get it all right. That's all I care about. It's kind of hope it's still real. Right? But yeah, no, I had to get comedy accounts. They are very cool. But it was when, when, when they're trying to talk to you real businesslike and you go, yeah, it probably won't be alive then.

Speaker 5:          01:15:33       Ooh, how do we talk? So you got to an a accountant that's just a regular dude. You don't know the comics account and he has like 500 comics and I want to name drop and my camera, he still doesn't think it's something Jewish. So he's still sharp. Harvey Altman, Harvey Altman and his kid. They're fucking big comedy fans. Well that's cool. So what he's trying to do is hear shysters and we'll find out soon. Should I said those happen upon occasion. They've done well by me. You've been shyster no, I said I've done well by you. That was my plug. I have to always mention Harvey Altman. Have you? I stutter and tried to remember his name. Have you heard about this new fucking thing that's going down, this new bill that they're trying to define the United States first up. First of all, them don't fucking ona me where you're talking to your laptop.

Speaker 5:          01:16:24       I just want to make it seem like I'm around wondering why I don't talk for 30 minutes for a second. Even fucking doors. Even Norton sits on there. What is, he's constantly just looking at his cell phone. Fucking, oh, I guess is always staring at a laptop and you're like, what the fuck is it does ruin the flow. You're correct. I just wanted to get your take. Always thought. I always thought it was closing like every time you do. Oh, and a, I love them. They're all great people. There's no pretense with them, but it all, it all seems like they're going out of business. Like what do you mean? They just have that attitude of, yeah, anytime they're going to start taking boxes out here because we're all just watching like they'd done. It's not even like for the show, like you're looking up something for the show.

Speaker 5:          01:17:12       They're just firing around why they're working. Oh, that's funny. Norton's fucking twittering. It's a problem when nobody stops everybody from doing that. She, I went on there last time. I felt like, are we really on the air so easiest? Just fucking check your Twitter all the time. I think it's just because they do it every day. Can you imagine doing this every day? For what? For six hours. How long do they craziness. Yeah. What we do is a lot, and it's still, don't get me wrong, no problem. Very manageable, but yeah, it was a very comfortable, but it was like where you go. I would just say, hey, we're just four of us hanging out. They're just so comfortable with hanging out there. It doesn't seem like from minutes I'll come on. You don't know. It just seem like that when you're in there you're, that's my favorite show to do because when you do that show, it's just like you're hanging out.

Speaker 5:          01:17:57       It doesn't feel like you know, so many shows. It's like you feel like you're upright, you're posture is upright and you're just trying to give a good presentation and then you leave. You know you're like, this is, I never feel like I connected with these people, but you know, you go to ona, it's just a hangout and people just walk in. You know. He had those people walking in the hall, just claim one owned the place and it was Marion Barry walked in once, Marion Barry and we were asking a questions about smoking crack. Yeah, but this was in the hallway water. Then the amount of energy dice clay can still put into being dice cloud and you don't use a master. You have no idea. What's an act like? I'm talking to north and he's my friend. I'm going to like how much it is that that's what it's like on the road.

Speaker 5:          01:18:40       And they like, well, you're not telling me if you don't know. Right. Tamworth is real. Yeah. Well he's got that, what's her name? The great chick from the comedy store and legendary Eleanor. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She was immediately knew who it is. That's who I was thinking. Oh, I don't know. It's amazing. She's amazing. She is the comedy store days. Yeah. When she's gone, that place is dead. You know. They, they don't have any of the old waitresses working there and she's still there. No, no, no, no. She's a comic man. She's doing well. Oh fuck. She's doing really well. But all the waitresses. Dot. There was someone over there. Why Rating?

Speaker 5:          01:19:16       Look at Robert plays a giant fucking half naked Robert Plant and cock. Right? They're clearly defined. That's an 18 foot ceiling and they're projecting Robert Plant's fucking package. While that's so weird, he's kind of his balls and cocker clearly on the left side of his parents. Yeah, no, there's this, it's almost sculpted. It's weird. It's not even real. And the way he moves, like he would be terrible at fucking, you know, he's not like Bobbi Brown up there. They haven't had a step back take. They called that whiskey Dick. He just looks like a, the way he moves, he's like real awkward. He's a bond. I wouldn't want him fucking me. I'll tell you that. I'm like, come on buddy. What's this? What are we doing? Ever seen me dance, Joe, you never know Robert Plants on the wall, but they just didn't have the same awareness back there. I don't think, don't worry. No, it's filming looked different.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       They are though. If you had an all time favorite band led Zeppelin, is it up there? No, no. Really Pink Floyd. The wall would be like on my top five albums. Yeah, I agree. But also have counting crows and uh, Tim Curry, who no one knows his fucking music at all. Tim Curry put as it really Tim curry the actor. Yeah. Really from clue. No, he had one kind of vague hit with I do the rock. I do the rock myself. No. Oh yeah. And that was it. Like he did rocky horror and then put out two albums and then he was the lead in rocky horror. Right. And he was thinking that that wasn't it. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. That guys are like a really good singer. The kind of music, he's kind of Robert, Robert, you putting him above us. There's no Zeppelin album. I want to sit on a fucking island and listened to.

Speaker 1:          01:21:08       That's crazy. You're the ocean. But I don't like music. I don't like it just fucking, it just ruins conversation. It does sometimes, but it's great when you're on airplanes. I, you know, I, I read or I sleep. I do too. I do those too. But I also like listening to music and writing. I hate music. Yeah. No, I want to download it. And if you're out to, if you're listening, I want a lot of fucking like big band swing, but no vocals. That's what I want to listen to when I write is no vocals. I want to have that background, Huh? Yeah. Background music. I do the same thing. You know what I do? I do Spanish music. They had fucking, Joe does radical. Yeah. It sounds just as an air of cunty right around it makes me write Cunty Ralphie may played the guitar. Um, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:22:00       No, but he just didn't fucking die. Like Ralphie May's in my death pool. I had to put one comic. This is a for money one. It's a real death pool. Not like just a something we joke about. This is for money. How much money? 50 bucks each person for a year. How many people is only 11 people. But next year we're going to get this rock. And I've never had more fun than being in a death pool. Really call a say. It's like having stocks. Here's how they're checking the paper. Like you can get super offended when you put them in your death pool though. Well I was, I like, I've had so many people I front loaded celebrity rehab. So Tom Sizemore if you're listening, Jeez, you know what? Fucking remember the of crackle of that rock. Gwendolyn. The self confidence. Get back with Heidi Fleiss I don't think I need separate together cause I need you to die by December 31st cause I'm in seventh place. My only death this year as Jeff Conaway and I get some, Oh that guy died, huh? Yeah. Well there's a bonus

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       system like if you die, if there's an overdose, I get another 25 points for the overdose and he was a scientologist. He went to that after celebrity rehabs of Scientology is another fucking cytologist late in life then very late, right? Yeah. Because Dr drew didn't work so he's trying, can you pull up a video of that guy all fucked up. Cause I heard that on celebrity rehab. He was super fucked up. I heard it like a bunch of different times but I never saw it. Did you ever see it? Who? The guy that got it done. That's because I don't follow pop culture celebrity Rehab because I hate Dr drew was such a violent passion cause he's a fucking scheister snake oil salesman piece of shit. I'll, I'll all on a fucking the new DVD that'll come out as soon as I can pick a cover.

Speaker 5:          01:23:59       Dr Drew is a good guy. I liked back to drew. That's why it was a real nice guy. Think some more evil because he believes what he's saying. He says some crazy shit though. He said some really ridiculous shit about marijuana and the addiction properties of it and the call effectiveness. Again, he's, he's one of those like, no this is part of the fraud. But he's kind of adjusted his stance on that, you know? And he's kind of like, hey, you know, this is what always pisses me off about people when they have this just his dance based on fucking the polls. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Well you know, it's a personal freedom issue in anybody that doesn't understand that it's ridiculous. And if it was really that bad, there'd be a bunch of fucking bodies attributed to it. And there is none. And My, my real problem with it is that they always have this whole late at night and Breyer.

Speaker 5:          01:24:43       It might be just on a fucking slab. Dude. You're going to be great. Great. It's only five o'clock. I'm good. Mad Time to three hours from now. You'll be self deprecating and plugging. Bray Bray improv tonight. Yeah. W one show. What time? 8:00 PM. If you're not listening to this, then you'll have no idea why the show went like that. Is it APM? Yeah. I guess who's fucking like usually a pm who's doing the show with you or your family? When's death? Five always fight. Always five. Always ate. Yeah. You can't have a nutty 1145 show. I've got, I've, I've played like three Improv's now. It was three out of two out of three. Three out of four where they hadn't updated the fucking video screen. Stop that fucking red band right now. It's making me, dude. You keep changing that and it's distracting. It's told me to show you the video. Search the video for Jeff Conaway and so I was going to play a video. That's Doug's fans giant that I'm against. Okay. I love your head. Let's play that Jeff Conway. We thing. Let's see the other, you got it up there.

Speaker 9:          01:25:48       Oh, that's led Sappho. Oh, he's over there. Oh Wow.

Speaker 5:          01:26:02       What's that music bro. Is that in this? That's your fucking shitty music. That's really in your iPod. Oh, play this back. So I got to hear this guy's voice. He's Jack. Dude. Put it early. Subtitling it for a reason. He's not making. I know, but I want to hear the noises. But that guy was fun. Eat. They showed, this is back when they glorified the priests story. Look at him,

Speaker 10:         01:26:34       dude.

Speaker 5:          01:26:35       Drugs Suck.

Speaker 1:          01:26:39       Killing myself. He said, how would you do that?

Speaker 10:         01:26:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:26:46       Damn. She muscle breaking him here.

Speaker 5:          01:26:50       True

Speaker 1:          01:26:50       with this. Jesus was glasses. I can break them, could slit my wrists with them. How amazing would it be if this guy didn't do any drugs at all and this was like a role he was playing to try to let people know he can still fucking act. Yeah. Yeah, and Dr Andrew is about to tell him that fucking God will heal it. Doctor June doesn't say that, does he? Yeah. He's a fucking 12 stepper. That's what Aa is. They put you into a 12 step program, but you're all about God. I know why

Speaker 5:          01:27:20       they do that. I think it's a mechanism. I agree with you that it's, it's silly if you want to look at it

Speaker 10:         01:27:27       as far as like whether it's plausible and crying. Hold on. Same time and symbol guiding. The audience talks to me. He's just, you laughing. Are you crying? I turned my head. I said, I'm laughing. I'm crying.

Speaker 5:          01:27:46       Okay, killer telephone. Thank you. If that guy was really acting, it's, that's really wasn't how. It wasn't how he really is. If he was just acting, that would be brilliant. What a great move. Somebody should do that. You should go on celebrity rehab. I'd like that. Yeah, but he wasn't doing it. But what a great idea it would be to show people how good you can act. Go on celebrity rehab and just fake what they stocked up. Oh, that's what they do. They've had people on there for a marijuana addiction. They just know they're, I think he said he's not doing it anymore, which I hate because I love trashing. He every take shit. We've got that new CNN show now. He's now he's trying to, you know, Oh, I'm not just a doctor of sex and drugs now. Now I'm a doctor of life.

Speaker 5:          01:28:29       You know, like yeah, this sailor destiny or they become celebrity doctors. Very tricky. Like that CNN guy that Sanjay Gupta, I look actually thanked him on my, no refunds. Really? Why? I just thanked weird people. Just, it's a, it's a name that sticks in your head. That Syrup Sanjay Gupta next it was Sunday. Stop with saying, Sanjay Gupta, fucking just make up another name. So I put Sanjay Gupta back into the universe instead of stuck in my like a fucking leper. That guy took a hundreds of thousands of dollars for pharmaceutical companies. It takes over a hundred thousand dollars a year. A piece of shit who, they're ridiculous. I can't stand those fucking talking about fucking white people's pieces of Jacobs coming over here and stealing our fucking, where's that at? White Guy. He used to hate Sanjay goop. Did okay. Someone over here. It's taken our corruption. Is that nonsense? Say or wow. You're right buddy. Yeah, no, I'm good.

Speaker 5:          01:29:34       I'm good. I just, I haven't been high and so fuck it along. Is that what it is? Yes. To not smoke weed at all. I don't start at all. That was like many years. I've seen you turned down. We'd like every single time until this is the first time I think I've ever seen. It's great, isn't it? I love it. I'm intimidated. Why intimidated by, no, no. I'm intimidated. I would. He made me smoke pot. Oh, it was going around the table. I didn't want to be the uncool kid. When you said you were, the only reason I even pass it to you is cause you said before that I'm even willing to smoke pot. Well I, I really want it. It's so fucking available. It's awesome. That's the thing. I want to have a taste for it. I want to stop fucking drinking so much.

Speaker 5:          01:30:14       The edibles, he knew. He didn't know why. The animals have a totally different effect man. It's like really like a strong psychedelic. Yeah. You know you eat cookies, eat me. He and he's fucking cookies at Joey takes. It's like every other drug or alcohol. I like. It would be starting, I'd be 18 years old, which is what I feel like right now where I'm just fucking stupid and forgetting that we have to. I can entertain you as we're fine. It's entertainment. You're fine. You're fine. I know what you're saying, but the point is, yeah, I don't want to have to start with, we'd like, okay, how much can I spoke before show? It always amaze me that you were so introspective. You're very introspective dude and you don't have any ego problems and yet you didn't smoke weed. I always thought that was really interesting because it always made because it was never a community thing.

Speaker 5:          01:31:03       When I get, when you trip with people, you're all like weird together, we're all fucking dog in this and every time I smoked weed it seemed like everyone was laughing without me or at me and I, it wasn't never felt. Maybe you gave up on it like way too early, maybe in your smoking with the wrong people because if you're smoking them with us, it's just a giggle fest. You know, we just spoke, we'd break down universe and laugh at shit. Yeah, no smoking too much too, but you're probably thinking it's like a beer where you have to have many hits. Honestly, I think like even before a show, one hit, usually it would be awesome, but he would want to do it, but it's been so long since I actually was like a teenage fucking weed smoker and realize they don't, I've given it plenty of opportunities. The problem is there's two kinds of weed. There's Endeca, which is what you always get. That's what you normally get in Florida. It's where you get, if you don't know a guy, it's what you get if you're not educated, indicates the stuff that makes you sleepy, it makes you, it's really bad for short term

Speaker 4:          01:31:59       memory loss. Sativas not so great for it either. Short term memories are a weird thing with marijuana. It's almost like

Speaker 5:          01:32:04       the thoughts are coming at you. So I should be able to do when you can do a fun. No, no, that's not what I'm saying. I'm just saying there's two different kinds of weed that the, the indigo is probably what you were getting all the time. You probably weren't just saying these are your legendary forgiven. A dude that smokes pot a lollipop and he can't get off the fucking couch. All right. Who was that telling me? I know a lot of people that if fucking tell him fucking yeah, it's supposed to be bought. Like I couldn't move.

Speaker 4:          01:32:36       Well, you know what it is, man. I like it hard. I like, I'm like, if it's going to hit me, it knocked me on my ass. I did say it. Yeah. I want it to knock my my ass man. When you take an edible, you know you want to, you want to really blast off into the, the ultimate,

Speaker 5:          01:32:52       like the furthest extent that you could. You could, but you function like that the same way I function shit faced drunk. Yeah. I don't always function perfectly around like I got to because I spent 21 years doing it. Like you're a fucking a seasoned. We get hangovers. I just feel like shit all the time. Every day, every second, no energy. I've quit smoking, quit drinking coffee. Rather I quit drinking coffee like for the kids, not just for a goof to see what you don't like it when you, I just sleep with the TV on the shuttle bus to the other wing.

Speaker 4:          01:33:39       I uh, I took off a few days and then I had a cup of coffee and it hit me like a lightning bolt. I was like, Whoa, is this what coffee normally like? Cause usually I drink it. I don't even feel it. It's like I'm so used to just drinking coffee. Like, I'll have two cups of coffee in a day and maybe even more when we're doing the podcast. I'll just, I'll, I'll pound down three while we're sitting there. And then you don't realize that your body just developed. Whoa. We need to process this shit nice and quick and we need to develop a fucking tolerance for it. And then when you don't have it for a while, your body sort of normalizes and then you'll have a coffee and it's like,

Speaker 5:          01:34:10       oh. Like it really jolts the shit out of you. My nerve, I attribute it to alcohol, but my nervous system when I drink coffee now, a lot of times I just fucking visibly shake just from a, I drink decaf. Wow. But I don't know if it's, my nervous system is like that week were just coffee affects it. You know, you're fucking, you get older, you think everything is attributed, does something. Yeah. And I'm so happy when my friends that don't drink all the time, don't remember anything like shit. Well, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:34:47       mind a lot more than a lot of people. I bet. Just because of the fact you're always writing and you're always performing. You're always putting your act together and organizing it and putting new shit together and putting out DVDs. But you

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       know, all of us, this doesn't matter who you are, it's, it's eventually this thing is going to shut off. Well, yeah, there's a water level high water mark to how much fun you had and it has to be more fun than that to register. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Oh, I get drunk with you in Indianapolis, but that's happened how many fucking decades in a row. Okay. I don't remember you. Did we fucking kill a guy that said, I don't that you'd have to be you dancers supersede other levels. Oh, we went to a titty bar. Oh, did I see tits there? Of course. I remember you from 2002 fucking stupid.

Speaker 1:          01:35:37       There's been too many decades and too many. Yeah. It's interesting when you look at, I've likened it to like if you went to your entire public schooling comedy, 21 years of comedy. It's like if you went to your entire public schooling and then college and then a couple of years of Grad work, but you are shit faced every day for your entire fucking schooling and in a different school every week and you come up and say, do you remember me from eighth grade? He's a fucking million. Eighth grade's in this career. And not only that, this just, you think about the numbers of people you meet every night. You're brains are not designed for that. Your brain is designed to meet like 50 people designed to have 100 handy. Cause Richard Jenny, when I was, remember that the head of the class chick I dated forever, the fucking Red Ed. I was dating her.

Speaker 1:          01:36:29       And so she had done a, a platypus man's like pilot for and and so she'd be at the Improv and they'd like hugging, kissing. You know how Richard Jenny was a bit of a ledge and she introduced me as her boyfriend. She goes, this is my boyfriend Doug, and I'm like this fucking cunt with a mullet and the corner. And he'd go, yeah. Anyway. Anyway, it's great to see you when I go out into the thing and Sushi and late and he did that a lot to me and then he was hosting one night, the fucking Montreal, like one of the dirty you shows when they are late night con tribes pieces. Yeah. It's the danger zone. And he was emceeing Richard, Jenny, you know the dangerous Richard Jenny on the danger. Midnight fucking get another 25 quids Audi.

Speaker 1:          01:37:24       He says, uh, I've never seen this next comic before and I went to let it go. You fucking hit on my girlfriend all the time. So you get like opening? Yeah, he, oh, he introduces me. I've never seen it. I've never met this comic before, but I've heard good things that I just opened with. He'd never met me. Fucking try to hammer my girlfriend in front of me like I'm nothing all the time. Wow. He took it in good spirit. Well till the end, until he killed himself because I said it. Do you think what really ultimately triggered? I'm pretty sure that was just a slow burn by young fucking spirited Montreal. One ranch has destroyed us office team. Did you like him as a comic? I, he had one of the fucking best bits and I've tried to find it on the Internet about uh, something about playing the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald parties.

Speaker 1:          01:38:19       Oh yeah. I try to find that on the fucking youtube. Hey. Yeah, it was a good comic man. I didn't know him as a human being. I guess you did, but no, I didn't break a great comment. I just, I, I know and I was just poking fun when I said that on stage. Of course. I know, but, but then the point of that story is now I'm Richard Jenny. Like people like you, you don't fucking remember me. I opened three like five times. Like I'm sorry, I know you when we're doing shots of Jaeger meister during that time. Yeah. And maybe that memory comes back, but you know, a have a thing called Dunbar's number. It's a, it's a theory that there's only a certain amount of numbers, a certain amount of human beings you can keep inside of your head. You can only have like a friendship with like 150 people and when it's more than 150 people and you simply don't have storage for it, so all the people that you meet, I mean you're meeting hundreds of people every fucking weekend.

Speaker 1:          01:39:14       Your, your brain is just overly burden and you try to keep in touch these people and stay friends with them. And it's a building process because when you first start getting any kind of fame, you're like, oh you traveled from Youngstown while I'll take you to fucking after hours. And then, then they're, they think they're your friends, but then you get more fans. So there there's a value to them because their fans and you've never had that, which is a shitty thing to say, but it's the truth. Then you get more fans and you're like, all right, I'm not taking you to fucking breakfast. They were done. I see it. Cause now I have actual fan base and then you have too many fans and then you don't even understand why they like you because you hate yourself. And then, uh, oh sorry, go to Douglas.

Speaker 1:          01:39:59       You don't hate yourself. No, no. I was trying to bring that to an absurd place, but the, you can't be friends with your fans on some level. It's a tricky thing when your fans, especially, you got a bunch of fucking psychos fallen, you know, like I, there's, I am not a forum suicide, a suicide letter I going to pose and really we got a 4th of July where and w I had my lawyer of fucking fact check it and it, it's a real suicide. Yeah. He's to kill themselves and send a letter to you. Yeah, they sent us letters. Read. I wanted to see it before, you know, it was nice. It was my friend. Is it a picture of 4th of July party at the house? So I get this fan mail. I always put my address on the fucking website. Hey steel stuff. Hey today it's Friday, right?

Speaker 1:          01:40:50       Whatever it is. Tuesday, steal something from work right now. Podcast listeners steal something from work. It doesn't have to have any value to some piece of shit. Take your fucking coworkers picture of their knees of their desk and mail it on the company dime right now to Bingo at two 12 van Dyke Street, like Dick Van Dyke to 12 van Dyke. Bisbee, Arizona, eight five six oh three so I put this, I'll do this every now and then on radio or on my Facebook just because bingos retarded and she never understands why all these packages are showing up. Post it notes. Okay. Some guys sent his his phone, I don't know if it's Fedex or ups or the guy wrote, he said this is my last day on the job, so I'm going to send it. He sent us scanner. That's so like obsolete. They can't replace them. There it goes.

Speaker 1:          01:41:50       So it has value and it was quitting his job anyway, so he sent something ups or Fedex on their dime as a fuck you Jesus Christ. That's a fucking funny. So what do you do with all this stuff? How much, what do you have stored? Oh, we haven't done, it's usually nothing of value. I don't like I fucking ups scanner. I drop everything at the thrift store. I think most people's like tee shirts that you get from, oh, so you just take him to mean commerce. My t shirt, a company and you go on a tee shirt companies. Have you noticed how many tee-shirt companies there are? Everybody has a chance to teacher, especially in the MMA world. That's, I really noticed it. Sell it to fucking the MMA world. Cause guys with fucking beer guts. Don't wear a tee shirts. I wear layers. Do you fuck with your clothes off? I don't fuck anymore done. You're just lost all, what was the last time you tapped? What prob occasionally you do narcotics and they go, Oh hey, yeah, I have a sex drive. And then you've, so yeah, probably a Portland once a year, but it wasn't like we'd just start laughing in the middle ages. This is so ridiculous. Wow. It's, it's just, yeah, it's such a nonevent. It feels fucking trivial. What does that like? That's a weird, weird feeling. What does I like?

Speaker 1:          01:43:19       It's like a, if you just didn't, you weren't hungry anymore. You want to eat no good. But it's funny how many people their lives are defined by that lost in that passion and how important it is for them. Well, you do see where like my comedy is fucking slouched since then, but you realize that you, you boil it all down to what was the root cause of all this desire was pussy and then, yeah, and then you get, and then you fucking blow a load on her tits and you go, hmm, isn't there a better way to say I like you? Like isn't there something that's not, if she likes it, yeah, she likes it and you like it. It's pretty nature's fuck job where now you can think pass nature where you go, all right, I see what nature does, but nature's fucked. Do you just hire you?

Speaker 1:          01:44:10       Where are you going to look at the actual fucking planet earth and go, you fucked up. I know it's a pump has attitude, but I guess to say that nature is fucked and we're right. Well, we are natural. We have logic. We're, we're natural too, man. That's one thing that people don't consider. I think that everything we do is ultimately very natural. Natural. The fucking the chemicals you're promoting or natural cause it came from somewhere in the earth. No fucking aliens, substances. Everything is natural. Even chemicals. It's true. Yeah. I think behavior is as well. I think uh, the, the people are so fucked up because our organism is designed to promote a purpose and that purpose seems to be technologically related. It seems to be about Baz purposes to get me a cocktail. Little Lady. I'll take one too. Fellow do me another one of those.

Speaker 1:          01:45:01       I'll take one of your items. Take one of your diet. Fucking off brands. Seven ups. You went to food clubs, special food clubs. Seven like keep dying. I keep diet for the porn stars. That's what he said. But he's got like some fucking offbrand. Sam's Cola. He told me he keeps energy drinks for the porn stars. They don't want an energy drink. Can I get an energy drink? Oh No, actually no. You have Vitaly vodka. I drank a red bull and vodka. I tried to get rid of that fucking Yeager meister burden. Just saying he agar meister on stage. You feel like I'm fucking, I'm 44 year old man saying Yeager my Easter. Is that a bad thing? Just feeling some point, you know at some point where you go, I'm too old to do this. You've had those moments. Yeah, when you're doing shots but somehow or another whiskey you could be 60 and still get a shot of whiskey.

Speaker 1:          01:45:53       You're doing Jaeger bombs and you're 60 sac commander, but any class, but I've, I've grown a taste for all this shit where it like I was all the beer that I like is just shit horrible corporate beer and I watched football too. So what? Embrace it. But no, the, the, the fact that you see all the ads are geared towards the dumbest people alive and you go, I like your product. Why do you make me feel like an asshole for fucking having a giant ad campaign saying that the fucking label tells me when it's cold because I don't have fucking temperature. It's, but that's what I like. Shit, enjoy shit. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm at terms with it. I just hate when it's marketed towards me. I know it's talking about when it treats you like you're dumb, but there's a lot of shit. That's cool. You know I like muscle cars. I know they're stupid. I know that dumb. I don't care. I like, I like, I have a Shelby Mustang. I liked the way it sounds. I, when I hit the gas, he goes,

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       mom, I'm very aware that we're on a planet and this planet is a part of a galaxy and this galaxy, I'm enjoying this fucking Mustang. You know one I didn't ask to be here. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. Fuck you and your, I didn't sue my mother. She's the one who had the fucking gall to create life without its consent. Yeah. That's my attitude towards anybody that tells you that you're supposed to be really involved in our political system. Hey, and we're born into a fucking system that we have no control over and it's absolutely completely fucked. It's really, you want me to really get involved and invested in this? Is that really fixable? Yeah, no, you make your own fucking government. It's what the Amish do. It's what gangs do. You make your own fucking reality, but then the federal government is always the big daddy looking over the whole time that you learn to avoid the same way you avoid fucking scorpions.

Speaker 5:          01:47:39       Arizona shake out my shit before I put it on. How often he gets scorpions. Well, not often enough, but if it's been sitting there for awhile, you shake it out cause you know your environment. Yeah, exactly. The point is, yeah, the same way you avoid every other fucking obstacle. You would just avoid the government. You vote for Ron Paul and it makes you feel good and it's nothing to do on a Tuesday anyway and it makes it theirs can't start a compound now. They don't let you do that. Can't do that. Don't call it a compound. That's the thing is people can have guns in Hong Kong. The church should be fucking like, Ooh, I'm going to get on fucking radio until everyone's coming to my copout Waco. You know what? Just fucking shut up. Go down and fucking property's cheap. And Texas. You get a whole compound and just say, Hey, do you think you'll ever mind fucking proselytize?

Speaker 5:          01:48:32       Yeah, you can get plenty of pussy just running it that way. Yeah. You know she crazy. Everyone that's in a fucking criminal element has to be so like they take it too far. Yeah. What gets him to the party ultimately drowns them. They drown in their own desire to occupy. Wall Street would dress up like Wall Street, so there were indecipherable. It's a fucking thrift store. You got to cut your hair. It's a lot of dudes with dreadlocks. Exactly. So commit yourself to the cause. You know what? That's fucking hell. That's why I love anonymous. Like if they fucking sold merge, I'd buy, I buy a shirt. I was thinking Brian should do a guy Fawkes mask day. We wear the mask fucking anonymous. Like people like that are in there doing something. They're fucking with the system. Wiki leaks is fucking with this system and you're fucking g, you're going to camp. You're going to walk for a cure is what you're going to do. What they are little dude is there represents a giant numbers. Who Do we need? Soldiers. You need a non like you need leaders down fucking. Yeah, but the problem is they go after leaders. And the beautiful thing about this whole occupy Wall Street thing is there's no leaders. That's the beautiful thing about it. But there's no, there's no guidance, there's no guide leaders. There's a pretty cohesive message. The point it could be done

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       if you like. Yes. Men. The style, like there's so many that you see that fucking, it's like, it's like a Dane Cook audience. Without a comic we you see that fucking need for, you could turn this force into something and they're such fucking dimwits like any movement, most of the populace is going to be a fucking dimwit and they need to, well, you know, I mean if you want to go back and read the conspiracy theories of the 60s and the 70s that the idea was that they were engineering our civilization to be the stupid and that they were engineering the poor neighborhoods that have shit education and keeping the, the priorities of education at a minimum so that they can continue to run people. Because most people are too fucking stupid to realize what's going on. As long as they can keep this charade going. Yes. That's why it's all falling apart. It's because the Internet now as allowed pretty much everybody to see what's really happening in the world. See where the real numbers are going for what Alex Jones sees. He sees something you can't even

Speaker 2:          01:50:50       z on the Internet. The lesson can I 91st unless you buy gold, ladies and gentlemen. Right now, they have baskets out in the desert where they're looking to put your goal setting or McCain, you aren't disgraced, sir.

Speaker 8:          01:51:07       I remember when we were talking about occupy all day and I said something silly like about how I think they should move to the uh, the trees and like make an easy walk village, I guess. Exactly. That's exactly what happened before the pocket was saying that the God, that guy's a guy from fear factor. Oh yes. Yeah. Oh, he's on fear factors. His name is Shane. That's crazy. He was on fear factor with his check. So that's a, they're creating all confused.

Speaker 4:          01:51:33       That's ridiculous. Yeah. It's a very strange thing, man. It's a weird movement. There's all these people camped out, man, and a lot of them, this is where the foot they need, why do you need a fucking movement? That's what nay. I'm Stan hope you don't need a fucking route. But to me this is an exciting time. This is really interesting. I don't know what's happening, but to me I see, oh, these numbers of people moving and these numbers of people protesting or unprecedented. We've never had a public display of how fucking pissed people are like this. A public display of how many people are saying this is in snow. It's insane. It's amazing. I know it. It needs to be corralled, but it's going to, it's going to eventually, first of all, the real unfortunate aspect of it at all is that they're trying, as hard as the Caesar's will says, his pizza of occupy Wall Street brought to you by all of the most unfortunate and aspect of it is that if it keeps growing, they're going to keep pushing it back and eventually something's going to break. You know, and they're going to push the boat. But I mean, we've already had people getting hurt, people getting hit with tear gas canisters and their fucking face flash grenades. We've already had a lot of that shit happen. But if it keeps growing, it's going to keep and they're going to have to push

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       back. I mean it's, it's, it's almost inevitable. But what I, so what happens then? That's, it becomes a real problem. Where does it go? No one's explained to me what the fucking fight is. The fight is that the system's fuck. The fight is that people didn't want all these bailouts. They don't think that all that is such a broad thing. It's absolutely broad. That's what we've known for years. You're right, because do general general ignorant reaction or not, not ignorant. Um, the mob action is ignorant. The reaction it is, I don't want to say ignorant, but what it is is it's, it's a, it's an unfocused anger with a good percentage of the people who have a clear idea. What's the problem? Well, there's a lot of them that absolutely running around, like from a completely military point of view. Yes. You need a bunch of stupid people who don't really know what's going on.

Speaker 5:          01:53:35       Well, y'all fortunately they get interviewed by the press. You need fucking numbers and most of the populace is dumb as shit. You fucking, you have to get numbers. Not only that, there's also, um, a real tactic of agent provocateurs where there's cops that I know that's up and go in and start shit and then arrested. Why don't they do the fucking same thing? Bag, dress, dress like a cop without going to jail without the insignia. Yeah. Put on fucking riot gear. Why are you sitting out there or I'm a week hippie dress up like a fucking raider fan. Johnny fucking Mad Max Element. Darth Vader. Yeah. Be as intimidating as that. More intimidating than the cops. Yeah. Put on the attire of a guy. Really? I just write her for fucking occupy Wall Street and not against them. I'm not, I don't know what they're for. Yeah, the system's fucked and I'm glad that you're out there doing something.

Speaker 5:          01:54:26       I just want to fucking write some ideas for you rather than make it so fucking obvious. I'm a hippie. Well, don't you think that's just inevitable whenever you have any sort of a gathering, that's why I want to join. I'd rather be gonna do. You're gonna kick the people that suck. I don't like comedy and go out and go hair and here's a better sign. Yeah, we are the 99% all right, everyone else has that sign. I want to fucking help. Let's make this funnier, funnier revolution. Like how is that going to help you get rid of all the retards? How's that? Doesn't, there's no way to get rid of the retards. There's no way to an educator. You can fucking educate your kids. You have two kids now and you can pretend like you're going to have an influence on their life, but you can have an influence on my life for sure. When you're not going to, yeah, they're not going to run the whole thing. It's an independent human being. Fucking Patton. Oswald had the great bit about how kids always rebel against their parents. So I'm going to be the worst parent in the world and we're going to have Phil Collins, no jacket required framed on the mantle piece. So my kids turned out cool.

Speaker 5:          01:55:30       That's funny. Yeah, it's a weird idea. You know, trying to figure out what way to push and pull your kids. You see them reacting to you though. So that's the strangest thing. You see them, you know, like getting upset that you telling them that they can't do something and so they, they rebound the other way. You know, you could see that, that pattern development really early where a lot of us, you know, I mean, I don't know how you were raised, but I met your mom. You're the only friend I have that I'd don't dismiss once they have kids because you have kids like a fucking, like a terrarium project. When I'm on a fucking control the growth, I'm going to monitor it. You're not a parent. I'm a parent. I mean I can just know you are by enjoy same way. You've never been like, we never met your girlfriend. I like, I'm going the, well, I guess most of us had the guy that brings up girl. Nope. Girlfriend. My whole personal life is a, it's almost like your friends or TMZ. I know. I'm going to keep everything private. La, he know me as well as most people. Well that was, I never met. Exactly. Exactly. Jessica. Yeah. Tone. Don't say names. Oh Shit. Sorry. It's too little. Fuck. All right, well we haven't talked in a while. It's all right. She doesn't go by her married name.

Speaker 5:          01:56:50       Um, yeah, sorry. Yeah, no, I tell people everything. I just don't, I don't tell the Internet everything. You and I have a never comedy, friendship, you know, but yet don't, no, no, no, no. And you're just comedy life. Like I, when you said, hey, I'll come into the UFC and I go, I don't like that man. There's a lot of dudes that the integrate these girls that they're dating into their fucking comedy life and they bring him everywhere and you know the problem with that change their personality, which I've seen since then. It's weird. It gets weird, you know, I, I've seen it. I mean, it's nothing wrong. I mean, you can take your chicken anywhere. There's nothing wrong with that, but I don't think you should all, you should always do things together. I think there's nothing wrong with having really separate lives. Bingo is the only thing is fucking friend in the world.

Speaker 5:          01:57:37       Watch. It works for you guys. Yeah. It's like whatever works, you know, for what me has always worked is you got to separate church and state for W. Yeah. I know. That's always been, there's always been kind of a border, but no, it's never ever border, dude. No. It's nothing you introduced to into and you're just so alien from like my shit, if that's what you mean. Yeah. Yeah. I'm getting back, coming back. I'm good. Gonna come back. You feeling it? Do you want an energy drink to push you over the title? No, I'm good. I have a cocktail. I fee. I just, you're centering. Yeah. My fucking head has been in so many places when you, when you're just like, oh, what's a microphone? And it was just fucking high shit. All right. You understand what a microphone is and I'm not really baffled anymore by the fact that we can talk to a million people of CBE.

Speaker 5:          01:58:35       Zick we're all in the same room. I think it's amazing how well you've actually held it together. I could ever podcast showrooming he did an amazing job. This, um, occupy Wall Street thing. This is why I pulled this article up cause I knew we were going to talk about this. This is, uh, the National Defense Authorization Act. This is what I was talking about earlier, where they're, they're literally going to define the US homeland as a battlefield and make us citizens subject to military apprehension and detainment for life without access to a trial or attorney. This is amazing. I mean, this is, there's something that they've crafted. This is another high thing, but you're acting like law matters. No, I'm not, but I'm acting like this is, I mean it's actually cops beat you every fucking day. What? Oh, it's in, but it's against the constitution. Like no one cares that such a, but they do care.

Speaker 5:          01:59:25       I mean, people were really freaking out about that. If you're one guy that occasionally brings something to a supreme court every four years and they go, you were right, you were fucked. And then he gets nothing out of the battle. But in your general day, you, sorry. Well, this is what this is, is trying to turn the US into a place where they can have the military patrol things. So the military, which control things like occupy Wall Street there, they're preparing for civil unrest and they're preparing to do it legally. And what they're preparing to do is to make the United States a battleground so that when you are in a situation like occupy Wall Street, you're literally like an enemy combatant. But they've been doing that for 10 years or putting it on paper. And that's what's really crazy. And they're trying, there's so blatant about it that they're literally putting this on paper.

Speaker 5:          02:00:13       You know, they're, they're trying to pass this through and people are fucking freaking out about it, man. Well that's good. Yeah. Finally. But it's still amazing that this is something that they're so fucking stupid. These people live in a different age. They live in an age of the media reporting things, you know, and when these things get out on the Internet and CNN is not covering it and Washington Times isn't covering it, but you can get it on your fucking computer and go, what is this shit? Is this real? And then you make some phone calls and you'll find out it is. And everybody freaks the fuck out. And, and you know he's asked her life miserable like scares me, scares me, scares me. They shouldn't be allowed to do that. They shouldn't be allowed to bring, look, there's a reason why people are freaking out and these people need to be addressed.

Speaker 5:          02:00:55       They need, you need to figure out how to deal with that. And the way to deal with it isn't a fucking tank. And it says in Tiananmen Square, there's supposed to be the United States and at the end of the day change without like drastic. Why is that? But it isn't. They were internet drastic. The Internet is the most drastic fuck. Nothing can ever be introduced to a society ever. People have, they have to pay their fucking mortgage. You, you see people that are like rolling their own cigarettes and if they don't give a fuck about some law passing, they're trying to fucking feed fat kids. So when everyone's down, it was like, what, when? That's how revolutions there is no fucking revolution of the middle class is. It was actually when the middle class rose up and said, I think you're right. In a certain sense, and I think it has your cynical, they're cynical viewpoint is pragmatical is, I mean it's normal.

Speaker 5:          02:01:45       It's based on data, based on history. You're absolutely right, but it's not based on the best that people are capable of the best to keep people are capable of. They're capable of much more than that. It's just that we can't pull it off on a mass scale. We're just not good at it, but we were capable of it. We're more than capable of pretty fucking awesome behavior on an individual basis. And then the key is trying to figure out how that can be relayed to the entire population as an ethic. And the only way that's going to ever work is if people feel like the system that they operate under is fair and right now they clearly don't. Right now that people feel like they look at all the money that's going into these CEOs that have been fucking what he looks at that they do, they do.

Speaker 5:          02:02:21       They look at the numbers, they can help it. That's your fan base. Don't ever confuse your fan base with what lives in the fucking world, in the dark houses and the fuck. You're right. You're right. 66 you're right. For the most part, they don't ever think about which plenty of people that do though. The people that are informed of that should be the ones that you're paying attention to, right? Water Cooler talk where they've fucking mimic bumper stickers. Yes. That, but they have no idea what a fucking CEO is or how it affects their, you're absolutely right. One of fucking get Velveeta cheese for their fucking kid and if it's a dollar off, they're happy and they're not even poor. You're right. That's a real question though, is why are they liked that? And the question is, are they like that because of nature or nurture.

Speaker 5:          02:03:02       And they liked that because they grew up in this fucked up society where, you know, in the fifties and sixties or whatever the fuck time they were developing, there was no information. Everybody was horse shit. Everybody was, you know, you, you, you act like information is something that people want. We are in a five that you wanted it or not. There's enough people that want it that are moving things. Yeah, no, but were we live in a very insular, we think, oh you have fucking 3 million listeners, but they just want to hear fist fuck jokes. Most of them. That's one thing like Facebook has made me realize how many times people laugh for the wrong reasons because they comment about it and lose all respect for a dude when you see a legit lol. Uh, yeah. But it so easy is respect for someone. I try not to.

Speaker 8:          02:03:47       So I try to be open minded about, I was talking about earlier though, I do LLS, I do happy faces. I just don't care. Like, I think it's funny as a joke. Yeah. Well you, when you do lol to me, I actually do think it's funny because I know it's not a real lol. It's like you're making fun of the fact that you're saying lol. You're going to just silly joke this three times gone, right? Yeah. Hey it

Speaker 5:          02:04:08       calm day that you are around four and hey, let me be the wacky neighbor. That's what your friends would say and then then they said it too much and you're like, all right, that's such a cliche. Let me be your wacky neighbor that now it's a cliche of when it wasn't cliches. Oh, it's funny. Again, maybe your wacky neighbor on your podcast, so that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Like refried beans, lol, lol, stop. Why do I have to my God damn

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       ugly head everywhere I look, it's just what it looks like. You got to just look at me. Focus on the magic. He looked very good. You look very healthy. Keep going into Diniro though. You actually look really healthy this time. You look really, you look really good. It's out in the sun. My house was on the fucking women's group is be home tour. So I had to be out the women's group. Busy home tour. What does that actually, I think it was like nick soon. I had to leave him. I'm sorry I can't call you back right now, but I haven't. I called someone with an excuse where I go, I, I'm ashamed to admit it has something to do with the whip Bisbee women's club. Oh that's hilarious. So they would do it like a tour of the homes in the area. They won't do it every year they do a Bisbee home tour cause there's a lot of weird houses there.

Speaker 1:          02:05:26       So we, after 29 years in a town of 6,000 they were out of ideas. So they came to us because we paint our rocks. Weird Duck. What do you do? You paint your rocks weird. You, I'll try it again. All right here. Jack, have you done anything lately? Five, five 40 pranks. You know what, it was the awesome, but Austin was just fucking wore off on me. Dude. I got affected by Brian. Red Band was when you would do those a pedophile baiting's did you put those out in a book? Yeah, I put him out in a book, but the title of the book is a fun with pedophiles, which I had never even considered because you know, I'm the fucking last guy to know. Even thinking about technology. Sorry, just this is another reason I don't smoke, but yeah, that's why you have a cigarette in your hand.

Speaker 1:          02:06:20       I never thought that people wouldn't want to punch pedophiles into a search engine. I don't know what a search engine, you don't want that. And that's the name of the book I get. Can you rerelease it was another hood. Just call it beating is. Yeah. The best debating is the subtitle. Oh, okay. Yeah. But Fun with pedophiles. That is a problem. Yeah, this is fucking, you gotta be real careful about that these days. That probably brings up some, there's like some crazy search engine database with the FBI, right? Yeah. Fun with pedophiles. I love the cover. It's so nice. Ballsy. And if the best positive reviews to look at that. Yeah. So folks go get that book because it is fucking hilarious. Cause I remember when a lot of title, the only stuff I've ever done that I go back and I laugh my balls off at my own stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:07:11       It was really good comedy. I hate it. I can't listen to an old album, a new album. Fun what? Pedophiles. I read and I fucking laugh like someone else wrote it. Well that was uh, those, those baiting days. Is that still up? What, what, what it means it's archived active, but you can read all their shit. So good stuff. So much good stuff. Wicked funny. There's a guy that called don't even reply. Com that fucks with craigslist people. But he only updates it like every fucking three months. You come back from Europe and you're like, Oh, don't even reply the have because he's so good. It's wicked funny. Wow. So get, yeah, go. You guys are bored. Go to, don't even reply.com and say do some more shit is out of Philly, I think. Yeah. Do you, uh, do you remember when the Jerky boys weren't famous?

Speaker 1:          02:07:59       Remember when it was like a tape that would go round tapes like a, they're making a documentary out of a, what do you shut up? Little Man. Yeah. Yeah. Red Red Bar. Is that what it is? The Red Bar was, that's what most is lack is based on in the Simpsons. The toolbar to the right, right. They based most is lack on the two bar tapes. Alcoholic. That was the famous two bar. Does this out alcoholic and then he finally catch on and he'd go, Yep, mother, fuck ICAK Sockeye fucking, I'll carry out. Find your mother fucking, yeah, the two bar tapes. Yeah. That guy was hilarious. That's what I was thinking. Oh, Winnebago man is a documentary based on those days, which is fantastic when a big old man is based on this guy who was a Winnebago salesman who would just, he would do these videos where he was doing a commercial and then in he would fuck up the take and they played all the outtakes. When you fuck up, we'd start squaring you motherfucker. You mother was con. It would just get crazy. Awesome. But yeah, the feel good story. At the end like you don't expect it to go well and it was actually a documentary where at the end you're like, ah, I fucking feel really good about myself.

Speaker 1:          02:09:14       It was because the guy was like, he was fucking a horrible functional. Okay,

Speaker 11:         02:09:18       sure. On privacy. I don't even, what the fuck I'm reading. I'll know what the fuck the real dialogue is. What the fuck is this thing? All of the windshield. Perfect fuck sake. Oh fuck. What the fuck did I say that in Psalm for shit did it. Trying to give these guys everything they can get to me. Not sounds like a perfectionist. No. What the fuck I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          02:09:37       Let's just get mad at himself.

Speaker 11:         02:09:39       We suppose we opened gotta do it again right now.

Speaker 1:          02:09:47       I feel like those guys that were, ah, we knew this one. They were garage band.

Speaker 11:         02:09:52       Oh fuck.

Speaker 1:          02:09:54       Let's, he's just trying to do a good time when he keeps fucking it up.

Speaker 11:         02:09:57       Donnie, do me a favor. Will you please? Will you do me a kindness? Yeah. I think I don't want you walking in and out. I don't dare make any difference to me at this juncture. Thank you very much. Appreciate that Tony. Don't slam the fucking door no more.

Speaker 10:         02:10:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:10:20       You remember that video is because of this video that went around back in the day when people just passed off tapes. Yeah. Big giant VHS. Dave, you gotta check this out. I remember those very world pooping on a deed.

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       Yeah, I would a, I had a friend from Austin, he used to give me these fucking mix tapes that he would make you. I just got rid of him recently cause I had already seen the images a hundred times but his videos would be all the weirdest shit that he ever found and he would splice them together. It was like an art form for him. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:10:50       Used to do that all the time. I [inaudible] if you Google search or Red Band Java lamps, I have a few of them like that where I just put like it was right when the Internet video is becoming big. Like the crazy shit. Like you know a woman found inside of an alligator, you know, type shit. And it was like just spliced and I put it with her like trippy music.

Speaker 5:          02:11:07       Wow. That's in a while. That used to be the Internet was just like, Oh, a human internet. Like you'd have to hand someone the videotape. Like that's how it goes. I mean, he could transfer that in that idea as a virus or as an organism could transfer all over the place from person to person and even be like duplicated. Even though it gets really fucking grainy when it gets like third and fourth generation. But that's what you had to do. That's how you got things out, you know? And you, you, you saw Barnyard Betty, right? Did you ever see barnyard bending when you were a kid? No. No. Really? I might've seen it, but I don't know. It wasn't titled Wild Optin. Rowdy was the guy that turned me as a young comic. There's a guy named captain rowdy, I remember that guy's name. Yeah. He was a anywhere like leather jackets and shit, leather chaps and Mohawk.

Speaker 5:          02:11:52       And there's a lot of dudes like that. It had like a fucking whole thing. But they had, he had a huge following in the south west, not including California, uh, but lovely. Lubbock, Lubbock, Texas, and take me on the road. And he was, he like, he's a, he's still, if he's, he would be in my death pool. If he had a Wikipedia page. It doesn't have to look at peanut butter days. He's going to die. He like calls me every couple months. Like he's fucked. It's a long story. I want to do a documentary about all the 80s comics and thought they had it made.

Speaker 5:          02:12:28       We were making five grand a week. You didn't even have to have jokes. And they, but they banked their light and you've, you know, some of the relics of that and do the, do you ever see the documentary beyond the mat, beyond the mat? What does it say about wrestling and it has it like Jake the snake Roberts and he's all fucking plan and some armory in Carney Nebraska and smoking crack and Whoa. And then old guys that are still trying to do it, their knees are falling apart like fucking but there's still in it and then guys trying out for it, they get it. So it's a whole balance of this whole wrestling seem like new guy, old guy. And I've had folks, I would love to do a documentary like that about comedy. The guys that thought they fucking had a ride. If there's a bunch of guys that Vic Dunlop was like a guy that I like when I thought of this idea, captain rowdy is such a fucking magnificent story. Do you think those guys, I mean some of them are still working right, so they're just out there just so there's guys that made it to the guys to get a perspective

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       of the guy that is fucking dying and lost his legs to diabetes and just did coke down of lawyers playing fucking Biloxi, Mississippi, Mr Saturday night. You know those guys. Right, right, right. That it would just be a beautiful fucking documentary to watch. Oh, could be interesting. They're just guys just wrote it to the wheels fell off and there's guys that are still doing triple gigs in their sixties but they're happy with it. There's some, some are happening. Yeah. Yeah. When I was living in Boston, there was a lot of guys won't accept when people are happy with things that they've built some kind of fake value system on. If you don't, well you're not there so you can't be happy. No, I'm actually fucking wicked happy living in a small town with, yeah. Yeah. I didn't move there to fucking make it big stupid.

Speaker 8:          02:14:25       Doug, do you remember the point when we first met? Uh, I came, I forgot Brian's here and I like talking. I came to Ohio University and I, it was like I recorded you and it, was that still on Youtube? Yeah, it was a walked like 600 people. They fucking, they billed me as I, I still and I, it was that tour if not that night as the last time I can remember doing a shows sober and I remember like Ed Helms was on the fucking bill and Flan again. Finnegan yet again fitting in. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:14:55       Oh somehow I fucking those the last time you did a show sober

Speaker 8:          02:15:00       last I can remember it was, it was parents like doing shows sober. I'm not by myself amusing and fucking sober. It was parents of the future weekend though. They billed it as like a family friendly show and but it was parents weekend this weekend. Family friendly is listed in the program and there's not a lot of fucking on campus options for entertainment. It's not a town. He said fucking campus what your parents and under fucking fun for all the family is the comedy central presents to her with Doug Larkin. Everyone else that they find it fine and then I like your kid's going to get fucked here. Like people in the video that like people were like yelling like you get off stage, you know? I mean this is high this year. Like some angry dad right beside where he's filming. Yeah. Are you finding this? I know it's on you. You were watching it right now here. Right here. This is a whole set. No, it's just pieces of your set and then it goes to the part where the guy starts yelling. People are like, Dario, this audio is way too bad. Then the guy starts screaming at that. You could hear that.

Speaker 10:         02:16:22       Yup.

Speaker 8:          02:16:25       He's talking about buff fucking read. Doris would never have these kinds of delays. Just say

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       yeah he wouldn't, but that's the charm part of the charm is the fact that this fucking glitches in the matrix. Here it comes right here are you barely can understand what you're saying. Unfortunately. I know. I wish he could if he get queued up to though.

Speaker 10:         02:16:50       Here we go.

Speaker 2:          02:16:57       He's full of shit and anyone crazy enough to listen to that mother fuckers who is he's, that's what he's,

Speaker 8:          02:17:06       but the whole time there's just people standing up and just like filing out because this was like the first, I think if this was like the first weekend with like all the new students, you know, were they, there was a third of the crowded a theater. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:17:17       It was so weird. Wow. That's an uncomfortable feeling. Oh yeah. People always get angry and I, there's this uncomfortable feelings like, do you do like we did those fucking music festivals knowing I was going to get fucking trashed and music festivals leads and reading. When did you do this? This is the reason. It's like two, three years ago. What happened? It's just that there's no way I'm going to fight. These are people that bought tickets for three days. They didn't buy tickets to you or comedy. Is it tense and I'm not, I'm not a guy that's, I'm not fucking Hedberg where I go. There's another joke. I have a guy that I'm like this, I'm a fucking two hour podcast of me stuttering and looking for a cigarette and then yelling about something when it strikes me it's not going to work at a music festival.

Speaker 5:          02:18:08       They were fucking just audibly booing me just cause I'm boring to them. Well you've still got your own crowd now. I know, but it's, they know what you're doing and they want to see it and a person who doesn't know you want to try to get them in there like you're not designed to work. Like when you're coming up your act as sort of designed to work on as many people as possible. You try to sort of maximize it. I wouldn't now I now I'm defining them. Actually I'm turning down fans at this point. But then yeah, a waiting list. It's like a lambo field. I can only have this many fans. Sorry. Stand on the porch. Like fight club for three days. You must get a lot of weird motherfucker said come visit you. You're so Denise throwing all the fucking time. I don't know what's going on. I'm still fucking high as shit. And indeed,

Speaker 8:          02:19:01       when I first moved to La, Doug was the first person that like I was friends with. I think, uh, like it like, well you obviously Joe, but like d like Doug would like call me up and just be like, hey man, I'm bored. You want to go make some shit about you? You only sell only this stuff you can say behind your back because you're very angry and it talks shit. No, no, I'm saying it was always fun to talk shit behind Joe's back. Oh, well we made it used to make these, so I'm saying, I

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       probably talked a lot of shit about Joe to you. Oh, okay.

Speaker 8:          02:19:31       Well we used to make these videos because he got mad at Verizon Dsl because he had DSL at the time. And so we were like, hey, let's go to the thrift stores. He would go to the thrift store and we buy like terrorists outfits. And then we've made these, we made these videos, he made these videos and I said, Marlin, I'm to all the, the, the Verizon corporate office number after that guy had been beheaded. So it will be like, I was even afraid to put these up. Like I remember being like, all right, you could get too much shit, dude. This is dangerous. You've got Aaron writing. What does that writing? Yeah, no, after everyone was like, oh, he's not really Arabic.

Speaker 10:         02:20:09       Right? You told me my service would be taught and it's been a week. And by the way, that's Doug on both sides. That was through a store, a Muslim baby backward before the Muslims ward tags off their burgers.

Speaker 8:          02:20:46       Hey, why don't we just play the fucking man show? Hit him in the head with a pen. Go ahead. Right. The second day is, let's not, let's, let's stop. Let's stop right here. But yeah, I just stopped the whole podcast. I think we've done enough.

Speaker 1:          02:21:00       This podcast has been like fucking, what has it been like two and a half hours long. Two hours. 20 minutes. Oh Shit. So at some point you're right. At some point we're right. Well, the first 20 minutes, I'm like, we've been here for like four hours. No, no. It's only six o'clock we're still good. We're still rolling now. Yeah, that they'll have cocktails since you're good. Do you want to keep going? Good for the show. I want to keep going. Another like 1520 minutes. Oh, I'll fucking talk. As long as people were putting in work on the fucking John, I want to dig another 20 minutes and then call it a night. Yeah. People aren't getting, you can turn it off at whatever point. Yes. That's a good, good piece of advice. You don't want to see me get hit in the head with a fucking good dude. It goes long. It's not like the fucking Bray at Improv where they're paying for parking or listening to a podcast. You're taking a shit right now. It goes a little too long. If it goes too long, just make it fucking three parts. You're the director asshole. One minute longer. Three part by hitting new is one minute long. Yeah. You quit the cigarettes for a little bit, right? Yeah. For a year. Got Fat, started smoking again, stayed fat.

Speaker 10:         02:22:15       Now I cough while I'm fat.

Speaker 1:          02:22:18       So you did it as sort of a dietary measure to just no, no. I just, I quit for a year, like 2008

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       and then went to Costa Rica

Speaker 9:          02:22:28       and uh,

Speaker 5:          02:22:30       buck 25 pack at the bar and you can smoke everywhere. You can smoke at bars. You just figured, fuck it just for this vacation ain't going. I, yeah, we'll, we'll just, just for this week and yeah. So I've been trying to quit since 2008.

Speaker 9:          02:22:46       Oh Wow. That sucks.

Speaker 5:          02:22:50       That must feel weird, man. That's gotta be a very weird thing, like connected to something, you know, and it's not easy to escape. Right. The worst part is every time he smokes, I want to light one up immediately. Like I'm like, can I just see it? And I'm like, all right, I got it. Like I told you, I quit coffee recently, but it's only been like eight days. I can't even say I quit coffee. I'm just seeing when it's likely it's not drink coffee for a long time. The third time this has happened, but when you said fried clams in a conversation before, right. I just fixated on fried clams and I made my face make the motions like I'm listening, but I was thinking and then you said something about fucking Burrito's you're hungry. No, it is just as the third time when you say coffee, am I fucking Bailey's coffee? And then I'm looking around and I distract myself. So what you're saying is I got a good voice for advertising just every now and then. You mentioned a fucking thing. I'm just saying when I look like I'm being fake, I am. Because you're thinking about whatever

Speaker 1:          02:23:49       you're like, why is Robert Deniro saying I should have a Bailey's coffee? Oh, Douglas. Why do you think it? I never think Robert Deniro, Robert to me, I think more of a heel Julio fallacious guy or whatever that guys love people. Again, I have like, I have a fucking high i's where this is like

Speaker 5:          02:24:09       came on home. I dedicate this song.

Speaker 1:          02:24:16       You need a mall. One point I thought I was getting my elbow in the pool because the ashtray is right here and at one point I'm like, and I pulled away like I was going to get all those cigarettes during the time we do this podcast. I'm going to like, yeah, that's it. Like 10 gave me a whole pack.

Speaker 5:          02:24:31       Seven, eight, nine, nine cigarettes. You're crazy. Smells. It seems like so many. You got that chain smoker. David tells two packs again. David tells worse times to, yeah. He goes to the doctor so he knows he's, he has emphysema. Like I, I don't know nothing. I don't know anything. How many swung into the day? Uh, not, not as many

Speaker 9:          02:24:52       a pack. Yeah. Pack now probably. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:24:56       There's nothing that replaces that. Huh? You ever try cigars? I could quit. I just fucking Nafta take time. Quit before cigars would make you a classic douchebag.

Speaker 1:          02:25:07       I was last year. Ron White, like Ron White has this exhibit. Yeah. He has this whole fucking, a whole circular exemption from Ev. Everything completely agree. Every picture he has it, he's under a cloud of that. That you don't know why. Ralphie may gut the amnesty but white

Speaker 5:          02:25:24       and he has this whole, Ralphie May's a lovable guy, right? Yeah. But Ron White on white barn, the whole yup. 100% I did I tell you about what he's buying jokes from. You know, he has a lot of writers and uh, Andy, he has bought a couple of Andy Andrews a bit silly and I, when I saw him in Austin, I go, yeah, you buy him. Like my buddy's got a couple of his bits in it and he said without any shame whatsoever. Ron White says, yeah, we buy a lot of really funny bits from really funny comics. And then what we do is take, take the teeth out of them so they're not funny anymore. And then my audience applauds fucking biomaterial I'm fucking selling fucking snake oil to fucking sucker is cause I know this ain't going to last. So what does he waters is act down?

Speaker 5:          02:26:20       Is that what he's doing? And he's just backing off. He plays to that audience and he, he's fuck heel toe, his fucking Rolls Royce off the back of his tour bus. He's like, he's like, he's like a vanilla ice in like jokingly, like he's like flashing all this because he knows it's pointless. But allies like flashy, like you'll like drives rolls Royces rappers like, I'm sorry this is the second time and fucking three days where I tried to find a fucking rapper preference preference and [inaudible] ll cool. Just go with Birdman. I said no, he's love of automobiles and he's very quiet. Birdman. Birdman. Okay. Some rat you fucking listen to. I don't fucking garbage. Well when I was listening to is why reality TV works cause everyone wants to think they could do it too. And that's why I rap music works because yeah, you could do it too. I like some rappers. Well I like Nas to know nausea's no really like that guy. I know he was a small, I think it was in a play off of like one. I can listen to notorious Bij all day. I love that old, that old shit. I love his, his rap style. I think there's, it's rhythmic. It's fun. It's fun for me.

Speaker 5:          02:27:38       But you don't like to use it. It's I understand. I understand, but you don't like music. But I can look at fucking Zeplin on the wall and go. I'm fascinated that someone could learn to do that. Not someone sat on a fucking bus with a notebook. I don't know about their fucking shit. I would take this for almost everybody. Seven notorious B I. G he didn't just make Shit Ryan. He made Shit Ryan with flow and a rhythm to it. That was fun. It'd be like it was, it was fun to listen to. I'll never, you know, that guy was an artist. He was a fucking artist and what he did was very difficult to do. It's, it's very difficult to duplicate. There's a bunch of guys that are a rap artists. Listen, I am like Cypress Hill reaching from the most uneducated. I'm just saying things with confidence.

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       I know nothing about music doesn't interest me. I'm like the last guy and that's why I always say I hate music is because I'm such a comedy snob that I know of. Someone said, Oh, who do you like Jeff Dunham and peanut? And I immediately hate you because you said that like, I have a bias against you and I know that I'm that much of a pedestrian when it comes to music. So if I go, yeah, I fucking Love The counting crows, I now I have to fucking, there's no apology, which is an apology when you say, Oh, I'm not even apologizing for liking matchbox 20 like whatever.

Speaker 5:          02:28:58       What is the the, I mean for most people, like music is sort of a source of pleasure. It's like a, you know, it's fun to listen to. It's motivating. What is it about it that you think it's just, is it interferes with the noise in your head?

Speaker 1:          02:29:10       I always knew, I found it summed up succinctly in a book that I will now miss quote and ruin, but Dow is the fucking guy, the drunkard guy. He was a drunkard in England. Dues. I always want to say Allister, but it's not Allister mcallister fucking, I can't remember his name. He summed up how pop music ruined the pub culture in England because when they introduced the Juke box that played over the conversation that you were there to have, you go to the fucking bar to talk and now someone introduced music where either you want to listen to the music or you want to have the conversation but out. And that's why I've always hated music. It's something that I want to enjoy. Like if I'm really high and I have 400 songs from my life that I can remember that I like, they're on an iPod. If I need music, I go to it. Like people go to comedy clubs once a year. I hear Ya. Do you find that, did you use to make music is something that you just who, oh I've music, it's just, but it's a part time thing to me. Like most people, comedy's a part time thing. Do us, that's life. Fucking listening and words and

Speaker 5:          02:30:30       I fucking love music and I get inspired by it. I love what I'm working out in love listening to it. I love listening to what I'm driving. You know? I love listening to it. Sometimes when I'm just thinking how much hit it encapsulates a mood for me. I just appreciate the art. I don't know how to do it. I don't know anything about music. I can't sing. I don't know how to play a fucking single instrument. So my, my interest of it is like purely as a, just a fan. Believe me, I wished I wished my fucking likes were more normal. A lot of people want to be fucking weird and out there. I want to, I wish people liked the fucking my, I wish I could play three songs on my iPod without saying someone saying, what the fuck is this? That's the theme to welcome back Kotter. It's on my fucking eye part. It makes me happy. I've got some stupid shit on my iPod to, it's the greatest American hero. I'm walking it all day. Wow. Imagine trying to put that show on today. They were like, what the fuck is going on to my next an Afro? That skinny dude with the Afro was just beating everybody's ass.

Speaker 5:          02:31:37       Beat anybody up on that show. Of course he did. Where did he get his power from? Greatest American hero. Where'd he get his power from? I don't remember. Running into walls a lot. Fucking glory holes as skinny 80s fucking blonde guy in tights. He was my first celebrity sighting when I moved to Los Angeles at a glory hole. No Starbucks.

Speaker 2:          02:32:00       Basically the same thing. I used to sell coke to have drove Loreal greatest American hero. He used to go there and play the greatest American hero and he was just suck my Dick Print April. I swear you're not going to believe who they going to believe the greatest American hero. Come on dog. Who Do you think you'd deal with?

Speaker 5:          02:32:21       It's just a fun dude and you hit another one man. You're just a chain smoking motherfucker. I know in my fucking head this is, this is a nighttime radio like it's cool. It's cool that we can smoke in here. I mean I don't smoke, but I liked the fact that you can't smoke in here. There's not a radio station in the world where you can actually smoke in a studio. That's done, man. Those are businesses, man does not a places of art. Every time you go to do you have like friends that do radio like Dale Dudley and radio. It's like Arizona for six and a half years. Never done Tucson radio. Somehow they like Tucson's against entertainment. Really? Why the shittiest fucking comedy club in the world that still exists since 1982 song from you? 90 minutes. That's where I fly out of, but it's 90 minutes with no fucking traffic lights.

Speaker 5:          02:33:12       It's just desert and a border check. Oh Jesus Christ. Border Patrol has a 50 mile radius. How did this fucking town, you're like only a couple miles from Mexico. How'd this town evolve? Cause it's like a line but it's sort of an art town. The copper mine went bust in the 70s so all the property values dropped and all the fucking hippies swarmed in. But really? Yeah, they occupied Bisbee cause there was selling property. There's no, no work altogether though. That always freaks me out. Like how to gain neighborhoods start. How did you know, how does everybody say, listen, this fucking two of us were living in this one building. The building next door has got, yeah, same way. Burning man started, right? Yeah. Hey, this is cool. You stopped doing your yearly thing to yeah, because too many people showed up. I didn't know the whole point of art. We had a fucking death valley party that we do every year. Just like all the people you meet on the road every year in Atlanta and you know, two people there, they're fucking great, but you're on the, they're not your friends cause right. So the whole idea

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       was to bring all those people into death valley with no fucking cell phone reception or TVs and it was as little motel. Uh, and we did that for till I get to a point where seven years in, well, the people that brought people last time brought people and these people, so none of your friends are there and all their friends. So it's like after a show and you're just like shaking, it could be cops and the cops were around. Yeah, there. Yeah. The house would tilt us to when there was some plain clothes. Yeah. I would imagine that that you and your, your crowd would be a perfect dark valley. Seven cops in death valley. So the one guy comes in a polo shirt and they're like, he's a cop. The only, we're the only ones that don't know where tourists. That's hilarious. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:35:06       Polo shirt. Sir. Can I w I permission to wear a shirt with no collar to permission denied. You don't have to you. You're a bad undercover officer. If you needed a t shirt to convince a fucking perp, come on boy. Get out there. Put them in pink underwear. There's your boy, right sheriff, our pile. He's the guy in Arizona.

Speaker 1:          02:35:30       He's amazing. He's on my list. Yeah. Nice. I haven't like, I had to pick one comic, so I went with Ralphie May. I knew it was going to be a fat black guy. He had a pulmonary. Listen, how close had been a black comedian anymore. Really southern. It's more and more southern. Does he doing Fargo now? He just, he just switched it up a little bit. Ralph. He's just getting out of the hospital, you know? Yeah. He had a whole battery embolism and there's part of me going, he's so many points at my death pool. Oh, I'm doing good. And I'm like, oh, that's my friend. But if he lives or dies, it's not stop my control. I had to pick one comic and I had a who did you just mentioned that was on my death pool. Oh, Joe Arpaio. That's my wishlist. Oh, add one pig. That was a wishlist, which was Nancy grace. Nancy grace. Now, um, now Joe Arpaio, this all these weird border guys, man, that's a weird way to live,

Speaker 4:          02:36:37       man. You're living as the law enforcement and a place that's known to have people sneaking in from a third world country. That's where things get crafty. You know, things get real tricky when you're dealing with that sort of a situation. He got a bunch of people sneaking into your state all the time. I mean, it's probably a reason why he's more, more fucked up than anybody else. And I want to, he's in Phoenix. No, he's a fucking Egomania. Oh, he's nuts for sure. But I mean that attitude is acceptable somehow or another more down there. You know what I'm saying? Like right next to the chaos. But it's easy to make an us and them situation out of that. Sure. But people really want to stop that nonsense mean they want to stop Mexico

Speaker 5:          02:37:16       from coming in Arizona. And one of the reasons why Arizona is so like Republican and so you know, so right wing is because they're right next to fucking Mexico. You know, I think that's the same way Texas is, you know, and the same way southern California, San Diego is really conservative to you actually on a much smaller level. They fucking hate Canadians at the border to do. They really, cause they don't tip. Oh what are the fucking tipping is one of the most important things. I have no fucking work the UK all the time. And they're assholes as you fucking can. I get ketchup. Like normally this comes with ketchup where I'm from and I don't want to put you out, but can you get, and they've, they're fucking cunts cause they, cause they don't work for tips. Yeah. Yeah. We're giving tips. It's big. It's a good system.

Speaker 5:          02:38:03       It's good. It's good to be real generous. Tommy Lee Jones, you just started getting some Tommy Lee Jones with the new lighting. Really? That's my new look, Tommy. Well, at least you're going with good people. You know know the gay guy from no, the horrible old Tommy Lee Jones. Oh, the old covenant. That's sad. Sad, Bro. You end of this podcast on a big downer note. We'd done. No, we're not done. I'm just going. I gotta pee so I'm trying to think of when to end this. Just go peace out. Who's on your shorts back? Christine Levine. Christine Levine. Wicked funny. Cool. She should be the new Roseanne, but really no one will notice. Really awesome. Willing to charge it out. Talked to Brian for it. I'm going to pee and then we'll wrap it up with chuck. Let's talk behind his back.

Speaker 8:          02:38:49       All right, let's do it like how we used to Doug and he really doesn't like women though. I know he hates it when you say you hate women. That's what it used to be. Right? Like he, he was really concerned about like, people are like, you're a woman hater in it and drove him crazy. And like when people say that to them or something like that, remember that? Yeah. Yeah. No, he was a, I don't know if he's still is like that, but yeah, he's so mellow now. I've seen him fucking just dress down a chick for no reasonable, some dumb chick. But that's what comics thrive on. Still putting. We're not you. We need a dumb chick. Stop yelling at her for being dumb. She's dumb. She's here because she's dumb. My favorite, my favorite part though earlier was when you, you call Joe Joey Diaz on that change art.

Speaker 8:          02:39:36       And he was like, what's a change jar? And I'm like thinking like, how do you not know how you fix it? I swear it was Joey Diaz. He fucking stole my change jar because everyone would come in and out. But only Joey was denying that he was doing drugs. So anytime someone's denying what they are known for defensively, yeah. When's your next break? Cause you usually never stole from you going Ah, coked out of my brain and then just stole your shit, right? No, I'm trying to, I'm trying to working out. I'm trying to work it out and I'll just borrow your VCR. My girlfriend is really is addicted to flash dance. I can't believe they remade that movie. Did are you taking a break soon? Because I know you do like stand up for like six months. You're on the road or something like that and then you take breaks or

Speaker 1:          02:40:22       yeah. Yeah. I always say I'm quitting.

Speaker 9:          02:40:25       I don't know. Who knows?

Speaker 1:          02:40:28       I've UK dates booked after that. I'm not bogus. Shit.

Speaker 8:          02:40:31       You got in trouble last time you were overseas, right? Like I remember seeing, I remember seeing there was some, like you said,

Speaker 1:          02:40:37       they are so easy to fucking stir up fake fucking

Speaker 8:          02:40:40       the newspapers is so bored. They have like 19 newspapers on an island. Right. Then it got some guy get in trouble though or like some DJ

Speaker 1:          02:40:52       censored or something because he just mentioned a youtube clip of mine. Yeah. What happened? I was doing the BBC at sub fucking poor bastard afternoon, like BBC snotty radio. They treat their radio like fucking Winston Churchill still fucking talking on it. And this guy isn't it? I did a perfectly straight into, yeah, we're performing here for however long and blah, blah blah. And he goes, but you're a very controversial, and I go, yeah, well there's not none of that I can do. So he just mentions if you don't believe it's not for everybody, if you don't believe it, see as Youtube clip about Sarah Pailin and the old no, not to. It's not. So people actually went there. It's about, it's just a dumb retard baby. It's a really funny bit. How's it go? I don't know. It's fucking railing on. Just Sarah Pailin. Evan a retard baby. And how she didn't use it in the debates and I don't know, I never, I, I went back because the fucking guy, it was almost fired from BBC for mentioning that Youtube Clip. He was being insensitive to fucking retards or whatever they call them over there wasn't your bit something like she had a, what was it? She had two sons.

Speaker 9:          02:42:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:42:14       And they were both retarded. How did it go? Yeah, one was at Down's syndrome and the other was a

Speaker 9:          02:42:21       oh, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          02:42:24       elected to go to Iraq or something like that. I never watched him fucking clip until it came up when he said it and I watched a clip. I go, fuck. That was a funny bit. He used to put so much more effort into comedy.

Speaker 8:          02:42:38       Do you do, when you write, do you like just think of ideas and like remember them or do you take notes at all or because you're constantly coming at me, shit on my hand, like my fucking attention span and my memory is such shit. Now

Speaker 1:          02:42:53       you write them on your hand. I'll write it on my hand until I get to a notebook. I don't carry a fucking notebook. Do you? If you have one of those droid phones, you can actually die. I know, I knew you were going to do this it

Speaker 8:          02:43:05       and then your bits will be on Google's offices.

Speaker 1:          02:43:07       I'm in first class, first class and I out my old fucking

Speaker 5:          02:43:12       fucking dog yeared notebook to take notes. And I go to the first class. Um, does anyone have a pen? And I wanted to work on my set on the way here. No one had a pen. Everyone had a fucking, I'll text you at Bra. Yeah. No, I'll just type it in the air. A lot of drawing anymore. I wonder what the fuck's going to happen to cursive. It's that going to go. It's going to grow. I could not write in cursive right now. Yeah. It's going to go writing itself. When I have to write any guy, fuck it. Send something and fill out an actual piece of paper. I'm like, wow, this is an alien thing. Making a little mark. I have to, I hope you recognize my mark. I fucking Accountant Harvey Altman Ma mentioned to buy a fucking seven hours ago. Yeah. Can you just take that out on my account or something?

Speaker 5:          02:43:57       You're my accountant. Why do I have to write a check? He's one of the fucking guys I have to sit and write a check to, which is so forth. He doesn't want the ability to just take money out of your county, Michael Wacky. It's, we need bit coons. Careful, bro. Bitcoin's Bro. That's the internet currency. Right. Well that leads us to our next episode about fear factor too, right? Coming up on bankruptcy. What do you think about this whole bitcoin thing about the idea of a, I mean, what is the concept of it is it's a monetary form of currency. It's on the Internet. Right? And people agreed to it. How does it work? What's it back by [inaudible] carrots. Stupid. Yeah, but it's kind of interesting. Not far, not even an hour. Um, it's interesting because, um, our, no, it was pretty close. Um, because um, uh, the, the bitcoins is like the first attempt I've ever heard anybody coming up with some sort of a currency.

Speaker 5:          02:44:51       Even if it's like really minor league. I mean, remember what Napster was like when it first came out. That was pretty minor league. Look what Napster became, you know, all these years later, look at, you know, you're getting songs instantly on your phone. That shizam thing where it's hooked up. It tells you what the song is. You play it, you press Shizam. There's music playing you pressure exam. It records a song real quick for like 15 seconds, sends it somewhere. It sends it back to you, tells you what the song is, then gives you an option to buy it. It's all right there on your fucking fallen. I mean, that's, that's insane. I mean that there's never been anything even remotely like that before, you know? Yeah. I can text.

Speaker 5:          02:45:31       He's like Joey Diaz from five to two years ago, but I'm not angry about it. I like what you find yourself railing against. What's new is when you're old, that's when you're your fucking grandparents. They all right. I just, I, I don't have the fucking, I don't need it. Like if I have a need to do all that thing with a fucking cell phone, I don't, I have no, my life is really easy. I've had a really good life and I have no problems. I don't need to fuck. I live in a place I don't need to map quest anything. Like it's over there. I almost wish I wanted more. Really? That's interesting. So what do you get your kicks out of? That was kind of the whole point of the DMT trip, which is unexplainable with you, was about your desire and desire is almost an anti Buddhist thing. But yeah, I don't, I wish, I wish I wanted more. Hmm. Fucking Louis C K said, oh yeah. I think he's a something I read about myself after the Louis C K

Speaker 8:          02:46:40       that was awesome. By the way, Doug, that was really weird to watch because, and I know you, but it was also, I thought you did amazing in it. All right. My favorite episode, I almost felt like I pause to shill for applause and gave it to me. No a fuck. Now I don't remember my point. You're Louis C K

Speaker 5:          02:46:59       we're talking about having joy. Take a joy. You wish you had more joy in what you do. Yeah. No fucking yes. I lost the point. Um, what, what do you get your kick out of? Do you get your kick out of performing? Do you get, you've got to killing still. Do you still enjoy like a fun set? No. No. Wow. Well, I know I'm always relieved that I didn't have a shitty set at best. Like is this psychological? I don't know everything psychological. Right. But I'm saying is this like something that's changed in life and just the way you've done, but I can't pinpoint it because I'm a logical person. Like I can really, I don't want to have to go to a fucking guy to talk. Like I try to find, that's why I'm not listening to your boring fucking bar conversation because in my head, yeah, I'm boiling something down to a point in your head, your your work.

Speaker 5:          02:47:48       My background can't find where I became kind of miserable. Hmm. I know it somewhere around the breakup with my wife but not connected like I was kind of like in a manic phase anyway. Well it's also could be the fact that you're drinking a lot of alcohol on a regular basis and that just really is going to depress you and a certain extent, it's not eliminated from the fucking list of suspects. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm really kind of tweaking about this coffee thing. It's very shocking to me how much different I feel from not doing coffee for eight days. You know? I really didn't think it was going to be that big of a deal, but the, the, the big deal is, and I'm not tired anymore. I used to get tired in the day, like somewhere in the day I'd get tired, you know, late afternoon or something. And then I just have to force myself to go to the gym. So I'd have another cup of coffee and then I'd fire up, then I'd go work out. But I was tired when I got there. I'm not tired anymore. I like the whole day. It's like even, and I was like, oh, this is what you're supposed to be like. He's supposed to be even, you're not supposed to be just fucking spiking every, you know, fucking hour and a half with some dark liquid that fires up your fucking adrenal glands.

Speaker 8:          02:48:54       Gray. I'm about to phone it in. Come on baby. You're not phoning it in Tuck. I love, let me get you on fucking Kale shakes this point. I love Bingo. Do you think maybe it's something to do with relationship wise? Cause say you don't have sex anymore.

Speaker 5:          02:49:08       I mean what do you need to show? What the fuck's going on here? What's this love line here, Brian? It's been since I've been a fucking adult in any relationship. The more the more you like them as a person, unless I want to fuck them. Maybe your overall good Dick. I'm saying good Dick. I don't know man. You think if you say laying confidence doesn't mean she cared. It'd be you're hanging out with the wrong crowd. Maybe not hanging out with a positive crowd. We need to move to la. You might not have to move back or to podcast comics. Sell fucking bag. Come hang on us. You can let her know. You can live here. We'd be here all the time. All you have to do is come back here and we could do this. We could fuck around like this all the time and we do shows and has to leave five foot.

Speaker 5:          02:49:54       No you don't. You don't have to live here. You can live in fucking Crestline man. You could live in the god Damn Mountain. You can live in Pasadena. So town, it was a town Crestline and the mountains. Lake Arrowhead up in the mountains. You don't, you don't have to live here. You could live. There's a lot of spots outside. No, no. I like small town. I mean you can find small town like knowing everyone's name at Safeway. I hear Ya. Hey, you love it then that's good. But you could also have resume. Should have got that small. Maybe go do a residency, bro. You don't have a, would you have a dog to bring them? Fuck it. Fuck no residency. Wrong to a dog. Kind of talk back. Speaking of the fucking Tucson, please help me. Oh, okay. When is it the reality though? December 10th. December 10th ladies and gentlemen get on it.

Speaker 5:          02:50:39       Where can they buy these tickets? It's Walsh, Brody Stevens, Brendan Walsh, Brody Stevens at the fucking one, three ups. Oh Jesus. Folks, we've got music in the mix. Well, Neil Hamburg, come on son. Never seen his act. Heard good things. Who else? Uh, Garret stab as a local and of course a beautiful, fantastic guests that from Ms. Lynn Shah, Croft Shazamm. They go, so that's a fucking hell of a show, ladies and gentlemen. Hell of a show December 10th get on that Shit. And they can buy tickets where? I don't know. Somewhere you can find it here it out. You're not stupid. December 10th juice did, but then I couldn't. Tucson, Arizona, the Rialto theater. Doug Benson and posse and crew. You're, you're having fun, dude. Look, you need to surround yourself with more positive people. This is hurting me. Hanging out with you here, hearing you all bummed out. It's about really bummed out.

Speaker 5:          02:51:28       I'm just really fucking new at being. I haven't gotten high in a fucking year. Like is that what it is? But you're being Debbie Downer a little bit. I'm always a little bit, he just, well, I mean, you're not having sex to me. Hyper aware of everything other than it's not a tripping is never good for fucking entertainment. No, it is. It is. It was just, I tried a small fucking porch and it's still good. It's still good. It was fun. Those are fun. It's a fun conversation. It's cool. People enjoy these conversations. They get to see you. You know who you really are, man. They get to see all of us who we really are and all sorts of different situations with tripping. So more feedback about the first one where I go, I that had to be boring to everyone. It was just me talking to you about old days and she was fun.

Speaker 5:          02:52:14       People loved it. But yeah, you gotta think you have a tendency to go negative. It's a tendency and you're thinking to go negative and it unfortunately, it fucking sets little triggers in your brain and you know, it sort of defines your outlook on things when you do that and you can, you can fuck yourself in bad state of mind. We can forgive fear factor too. But if you start going motivational speaker, Tony Robbins, I'm going to get one of those Bobbi Brown headsets. I don't want to go out there. I'm going to show to people fives. And you know what? The negative vibes, creating negative atoms in your DNA, you make negative children. You don't want that in residence is all off man. He needed a different crystal on your neck. She'd be excited. Be Be excited. Be. That was the, we could go off forever about motivational speakers.

Speaker 5:          02:53:03       But the last thing I want to talk to you about his comedy classes, cause I thought this is really funny how while cs I've talked to on the phone again, it's like Dane Cook, like I talked to Kyle, she's, I go, it was, it was funny. It created good Internet buzz. Yeah. It's a dumb thing. I'm always, I don't have to be high to be hyper aware of how pointless comedy is and the fucking scam that we get away with doing this for a living when it should be free. You say that and I agree and in a certain way, but in another way I don't agree because I was always happy to pay for it and I enjoy it still as an art form. I think it's the most fun form of entertainment. I think that we've been in it for so long, you know, I think for some of us, we might've forgotten how much we appreciated it in the beginning, you know, forgotten. It's still the same thing. I've always forget. I was always, you're always hating it from the beginning. No, not from the beginning. 10 years. I knew the Hollywood blow job was like all this fallacy. I don't want to do anything more. Say hedbergs joke about, Oh, you're a comic. Can you write or can you act as was saying, oh, you're a, you're a, you're a cook. Can you farm?

Speaker 5:          02:54:26       Yeah. I remember. Thank you for letting me fucking embarrassed. Mitch Hedberg is fucking grave. He got through it though. You still got a good punch line out of it because there was a pause. This, you know, it's to be, if you didn't, you didn't do a lot of, I saw I've only had three drinks by the way, in fucking three hours, so not everything's great. No worries. No, I'm just, I'm worried about prayer. You're fine. I can't wait. 21 years of comedy. Do you know how many times I've played the Bray Improv? Never really. So if it goes poorly, I'm not worried about my career. Do

Speaker 1:          02:55:04       it. It's a great comedy club. Oh No, I love it. I'm just praying this prayer is one of the things we'd go in with that attitude of it doesn't fucking matter. You're usually funnier. Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. And I'm looking forward to show tonight, man. No pressure. No pressure. I'm just going to sit and be creepy in the back and if you're doing something I don't like, I'm just gonna shake my head. Put myself at like a really nice position last night. Yeah, last night. Uh, I go, yeah. Rogan said he's coming, but he's no way he's coming. Why is he sad? Because it's fucking Irvine plastic. Yeah, no fucking way. We already worked it out that it was coming tonight. Yeah. Well No. You said, Oh, I'm going to come to both and I know you're not going to come to both. Who would say that?

Speaker 1:          02:55:44       It's high. It's ridiculous. Why would you, why would I? That would be even creepier if I just sit and watch the same James Robbins, a man of his word. I go, no, he stated flipping leaves and there's no, there's no glass to the comedy. Love you dad. There's no one joke, no dead fucking Patrice O'Neal wrapped up in a Greg Geraldo with a Freddy Soto on top. There's no comedy worth driving to Irvine from La. That's not true. I was going to go see you if you didn't do the podcast. I know you were only doing Irvana would've gone to see you there for sure. Cause brand to me is almost a convoy of right now. If you drive to the fucking Irvine, they make traffic move as a convoy with flags on Towncars. Oh, I wish that'd be awesome. Could just have magic. I go, Hey, I'll do your podcast.

Speaker 1:          02:56:41       Uh, I think we can con my record company in a getting a driver and he Rogan goes, ah, now I have my own service. I'll have him pick you up at one 30. Good for you. Because that odd, no, but the, the fact that you have a bell that you ring out on your porch too, to summon the person. That's good. No, no, that's affluence. But no, that you're not someone I feel uncomfortable around like you and Ron White where the two guys that I all right. No matter how you're still, you feel like you've changed. Who have you ever met that the got some money, you know, for a lot of people, you know what it is man. They get something and then they don't want to lose it and then they get scared and then they clam up and then they stop doing anything.

Speaker 1:          02:57:25       Controversial styles. I know like a tell, I've never, no one gets close to a towel. Like he's just, well he's, you know what, I don't like to ever judge anybody or look at them all in categories. I just tell you who I love and I love it. Tell, tell, I would say is fucking pound for pound as they say in your industry. The best, the best of our generation. Um, I don't know if I can agree with that because you know, quite honestly, I shift back and forth on a bunch of different guys. I go back and forth, but I stopped trying to put them in an order, but it Hedberg guide. But like the joke for joke,

Speaker 5:          02:58:02       no one has more fucking jokes and personality than a tell five jokes in a job. I will never, you know, argue with you on that. I just think he's amazing, but I don't, I don't put them all in an order, you know? I just have, I've decided somewhere along the line just to appreciate him. Don't try this. A little trap for me at least. [inaudible] Thompson part of it where you go, would you want to be that miserable of a fucking person to be that good to be that funny? You think you're doing it? He's one of us really knew by how much, but yeah, no, he's really like, he makes me like, I, I go just, let's go to Costa Rica together. Let's just go on vacation. But I got to this pilot and I just know it's no good and I'm didn't find he had a DVD like for three years he's been editing, but he hates every word of it. You're like, great. More fucking jokes in a conversation while I'm drunk. Then I write in a fucking notebook book in a year. Well he would, he is as a real fucking professional. It's a boot Koski thing. You want to be that fucking miserable of a person to put out that good art. Me, I'd rather fucking phone it in.

Speaker 5:          02:59:12       I honestly don't think it's an either or. I think you can just enjoy the whole process. I fun. I love it.
