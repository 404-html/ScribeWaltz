Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Well, we're doing it. Yeah. Jesus, I'm not prepared. Can experience is brought to you by the fleshlight my favorite masturbation toward the only one that I've ever used ever in my life. And if they hadn't sent me one, I probably wouldn't have used it. But they did. And it is awesome, is way better than beating off and let's be real. Everybody beats off. So do yourself a favor and just give into reality. Don't touch that thing. Everybody's touched that. It's disgusting. Everybody's knowledge it do yourself a favor. Go out and get yourself this amazing beaten off and instrument. It's really a fantastic piece of engineering and design designed by a guy actually whose wife was pregnant and he couldn't have sex, you know, cause it was like six months in the pregnancy and it gets a little sketchy. You know, like what the fuck am I doing here?

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       You know, I'll creep mind that I'm sticking, you know, especially if you're, if you're like just spending putting your mouth, you know, she's pregnant. She had the babies inside of, are you just trying to get your load off? You better off. You feel like you're supposed to be beaten off shore from personal experience? Like what's the cutoff point? Misses Rogan well liked it all the way up until the end, but oh wow. To me I was like, this is the deal. You tell me when it's go time cause I don't want to be the one that's trying to fuck you while you're walking around with a fucking 10 pound baby inside you. It's just crazy. It's weird. Yes they do. They get really horny. They get really horny. It's supposed to actually be good to actually helps uh, the baby come out or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       It helps dilate you or some crazy cause he get like hotter to you as it moves along. And they were like, are you like, oh yeah, eight months. This is very strange. It is. I mean you can only imagine it, you know, you don't know. It becomes almost alien cause it's, you know. Yeah. Because you know, you're still horny. You know, everyone gets horny and she's still an attractive woman. But the, the issue is there's a baby in the mix here and it's on her. So it's a very different experience when it's just a woman and her body and your body. It's just sex. It's just fun. It's just two people enjoying each other's bodies and Lars did passion, but when you got a baby inside a person, but that's a totally different mix. Totally different mix and knowing that like eight months along that like it's you doing that.

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       That's a bay time before. No, but it's a your swimmers, so you know. Yeah. It's like your own product is in there. Yeah. It's very strange. And it's also your, you are now acutely aware of what the experience really is. The experience of actually having a kid actually the experience of making new human beings. It is. You know, you, you have been tricked into some ancient mechanism that's designed to make animals create more animals and you are, most of your life moves in the flows of these needs and wants, whether or not you realize it or you don't realize it. Once that baby comes out, you are forced into a recognition. It's a, it's a real humbling experience because you realize, wow, this whole thing is way bigger than me. You know, and you, you also realize, well, hey, now there's this person that I love more than me. There's a little

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       tiny person. I'm responsible for everything that has to do with their life and their education, their, their experience of the guide them and protect them. It just so, so while this is all happening, you're trying to shoot a load into a check, you know, it's like you don't feel the same way

Speaker 3:          00:03:15       when you put it down.

Speaker 2:          00:03:15       Strange. So this gentleman invented something that he could relieve his manhood with that he didn't feel like waking up the wife while she's about to throw up in the morning and sticking his dick in her butt. Tried to be nice. He's a nice guy. What about your book books? Little pregnant. Pregnant? Sure. Yeah. So anyway,

Speaker 3:          00:03:34       fucking Bro, I have to do that at some point. Like I got to make a light. You don't have to, but you know, but the, the biological imperative is there. Like I'm just starting to feel I'm 35 and it starting to like, it's starting to kick in and it's terrifying and not the birthing part. That part doesn't scare me because I've taken some huge shifts and I feel like I could do that, but the growing inside of me like an alien. Oh yeah. Well your insights spread. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:04:00       it's very psychedelic. You know it's life becomes very different than then it was anyway. Yeah. If you went to in the code name Rogan on the Joe rogan.net website, is it a flashlight link? You will get 15% off the number one sex toy for a minute. That was a commercial that was there you guys. That's how it like commercials, man. This is the only way I can do them. I listen to people do can commercials on like other radio shows and I respect what you're doing, but God, that seems boring. I'd rather really say something about it every time I use it to fucking awesome product. Another awesome product is Alpha brain. We were sponsored by [inaudible] Dot Com and o n n I t.com. And there's another thing that we've got now called new mood and what new mood is. It's a five HTP supplement and a lot of people like Neil Brennan turned me on to this stuff first and five HTP actually when you take it in allows your brain to produce more serotonin.

Speaker 2:          00:04:53       It breaks down into Serotonin and I actually makes you feel good. It gives you like a nice feeling of wellbeing. And a Neil started taking it and uh, he said he was taking like, like three or four times where you're supposed to take. And I was like, is that like safe? He goes, I don't know, but I feel great, so fuck it. Um, but so he, so I started taking it after he told me about it and it definitely does something, gives you like a weird little, a minor feeling of happiness is like the best way to describe it. Very nice. And this stuff, this new mood stuff with this stuff. What we'd done and we'd taken, um, five HTP n added l trip to fan and l Tryptofan, uh, actually breaks down. It's like one of the building blocks for five HTP. So He'd take the two of them together and it gives you sort of like a time release quality and it's just very, they're very mellowing.

Speaker 2:          00:05:38       I like it a lot. It's a, it's really, uh, a good calming supplement. And again, like I say with all the, uh, on it supplements, if you think of are too expensive or whatever, you can definitely get it for cheaper, just copied ingredients, man. Go Online, find the, find the ingredients, they're readily available on [inaudible] dot com go buy the stuff in bulk and you'll definitely save money. And I, I'm happy if you do that. I swear to God that is that like calming in general or like calming before bed kind of thing? Well, I take it before bed. I take it, I take two of them right before going to sleep. But, um, uh, some people take them during the day, you know, some people like to take them if they're not getting enough sleep or extra stressed out or something like that. It's a real weird world, the world of nootropics because it's sort of just sort of being explored now and just sort of coming into public consciousness and there's a lot of misconceptions about what it does or what they do.

Speaker 2:          00:06:28       And I don't think each one works for everybody there. There's some that I'm not feeling them. I tried them and it doesn't do shit for me. And there's other people that swear by this stuff. So you got out kind of just without me getting into too much depth because it would really take up the whole of the show, go look up nootropics and try a bunch of different things. It's, it's, it's fascinating, but I think that they can enhance, uh, the way your brain functions. It makes it feel a little better. It makes it work a little better. And, you know, there's a lot of arguments back and forth about this stuff and for good reason because a, you know, a lot of people when you're saying that you can make people think better, but that sounds a lot like big dick pills, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:07:01       And people always say that to me. Like, how is what this is bigger than big Dick Pills? Well, you know what man, it's, it's better in that it actually works and it might not work for you, but it works for me and it works for other people that I know and it's 100%. It's not, it's not like a placebo effect. It gives me the most lucid dreams that I've never had in my life. And the big shift has been taking this stuff. And um, as I said, there's a bunch of different ones available online in a lot of different people have written about them and you could kind of create your own little concoctions. It's a fun thing to get into. It's kind of interesting. I believe in vitamins. I take multivitamins, I take minerals, I take amino acids, I take fish oil. I take a lot of different things as well as like a juice every day.

Speaker 2:          00:07:49       And I drink like this Kale shake every morning. I think I'm a big proponent. Well I, you know, I try to be, you know, I try to be as much as possible cause I'm, I'm a big proponent of taking care of your body. I know when my body feels better, I know when I'm, yeah, when you look terrible, you look right now. Thanks Ben. When you, when you, uh, when it doesn't feel good to me. When it's not working well, nothing works well in my life. I find that my life is always best in order when I'm in shape because when I'm in shape and I feel good that I don't have to worry about that, that's out of the way. So now I don't feel like a lazy piece of Shit. So since I don't feel like a lazy piece of Shit, all these other things seem to fall in place much easier.

Speaker 2:          00:08:28       You said something one time to me that uh, I thought about my bunch is um, you said, I think if you better yourself in one area of your life, it has a residual effect on, and I think that's true. I thought about that a lot like that when you are doing something to better yourself, it's not just like if it's working out, the benefit is there's more, there's a benefit that falls into like your, they can fall into your creative stuff or your work stuff cause you're bettering yourself and it has that residual effect. You know what I mean? So cause we'll leave you work out and you take it seriously, which I've started to more, even though I'm still lazy shit, like I've started to more than you think about things more like well I'm going to work out like this. I need to eat better.

Speaker 2:          00:09:13       Yeah. And then if I'm going to be tired I need to rest more. Right. And that then will better your other aspects of life, you know, you're going to feel more rested and it's like you got to give yourself awesome advice. Yeah. The real problem is getting yourself to do what you would advise someone else to do. That's where it becomes difficult, right? You know, when you try to tell somebody, do something that you don't do yourself, like, hey man, you should work out me and my fucking eat a cheeseburger. I mean, a lot of people do that, right? There's a lot of people that do that because they know someone in the back of their head. They know the advice that they would give themselves. They're just for whatever reason, not quite bright enough to give it or not quite motivated or not quite clear enough or too conflicted in whatever way and whatever area, you know, everybody's got their own thing, their own confliction that allows them to, you know, branch off into passive distraction.

Speaker 2:          00:09:59       But, uh, I think the big key is balance. The big key is a a balance act. You can, you cannot only be work, you must have fun, but you cannot be only fun. You must have work. There has to be things that get done. There has to be information that gets absorbed. Your brain and your body, if not given a task, if not given a purpose on this planet, starts to think, what the fuck am I here for? You know? So the only way to true happiness, like ultimately it is silly. Ultimately we are just one frame and an infinite movie that goes on forever and that this life might not be important, but the only way to enjoy it while you're here is to find things that you enjoy inside of it and you, you can't totally completely look at the big picture, but ultimately you can't anyway.

Speaker 2:          00:10:43       Because even if you look at the big picture with your life and then you get past that, you go, well, at least I got past that. The fuck you did. How about the big picture of the universe? How about the big picture of the sun? The Sun is only going to last another few billion years and that bitch is going to fizzle out and everything on this fucking planet is either going to die and some horrible explosion when it goes supernova or it's going to freeze to death first. Look, it's ridiculous. It's all temporary. Every fucking thing that's ever been done. So you can get crazy like that. But what I found is we're stuck here and the only way to enjoy here is to find stuff you like doing. Do that and have a good time. Have a good time with here. And one of the best ways to have a good time. He says, take care of your fucking body. Okay, you,

Speaker 3:          00:11:25       I think you're totally right. If you ever read Heidegger, yeah, it's a little, okay. Well he said it. The meaning of being capital B, the big picture is located in care, meaning what? We attribute our care, what we give care to. So you could care for a pair of headphones and that gives your life. Inherit me like, I'm sorry. Life is not inherently meaningful.

Speaker 2:          00:11:45       Are you talking? It's meaningful when you care about, so you attribute care to somebody doing Brian. He's looking at the screen. All right, well look at it yesterday. It's preserved. It's killing. What is it doing?

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       It's kind of just making, okay, but why are you doing that when she's talking man? Huh? I know I was making this special effect. Okay. But my indirect in her conversation and you were bro. That's what just happened. It's pretty sweet. Okay. We don't care though, man. This is, a lot of people are not going to see this on Ustream. So let her finish what she was saying. She said something important. I love when you scold Brian. Okay, well that was really, it was, he just interrupted you while you were on a roll. So fucking desperate. Some childish shit. Dare you. Some childish shit. We love you, but you're a little baby anyway,

Speaker 3:          00:12:26       but you're right. And it is about attributing care, cause life in and of itself. I don't think life is inherently meaningful. I don't think that, uh, there is some magical wizard behind the curtain that, that created all of us and we're also special and awesome. I think it is what you make of it. And um, I wish I exercise more as the point. I'm very sorry I'm stuck in my head. You know what I mean? I've been this way since I was a little girl. When little, when everyone else was running around, I was laying on top of the monkey bars and I've always been super fucking lazy and I wish I had this, this design, like I wish I had your athleticism or just something about me that enjoyed sweating. Like I fly. I just fucking hate it. And I,

Speaker 1:          00:13:06       you don't have to love it. Everybody's different. It takes every type of people to make this world go round. But we're going to give you some Alpha brain before you leave. Maybe wants to take that. It'll get your fucking head and gear and you'll see the light. Go to Joe rogan.net. Click on the [inaudible] dot com link and enter in the code name Rogan, and you get 10% off. That also was, this is a commercial and a conversation. See how we do it. That's what we do our commercials here. Wow. Joe Rogan experience podcast. It's organic. I grow these bitches in manure. Sun hit it. The Joe Rogan experience. Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

Speaker 4:          00:13:51       Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:13:51       sweet baby Jesus. The dynamic duo or are here ladies and gentlemen, the funniest couple. I know the only couple of comedians worth a fuck. Wow. Wow. There's a couple other ones. I guess Brian Duncan into Tasha are still have. Yeah, they haven't pulled the trigger. Made that shit legal. Tom Segura and Christina Segura who doesn't use the last name? It's a girl on stage. Why do you not? Why did you not together you are more strong. Do you want the real talk? Yes. Legally. My

Speaker 3:          00:14:25       name is Segora by stage and because documents kid, but because I uh, my parents are Hungarian immigrants. They escaped from Hungary in 1969 went to Canada. I was born there. I moved to La in 1980. So that stupid Polak Palicki name. It's like my parents fought so hard to get me here. And every time I see a club, put it on the marquee, it makes me proud. And it's a stick it to, you know, I'm a fucking dumb Polak and you guys can suck it. Yeah. That's who I am. And uh, you know

Speaker 1:          00:14:59       that's very, very admirable. Don't you think they would like it more though? If their name didn't hold you back your fucking name cause shit. Good luck spelling that. Yeah. Good. Let's finish you guys for all the marbles. The other thing is at what point, like if you've started, would you consider like obviously you, you know, 20 years in or 10 or five, but like after you've done a couple things and you have your, your name and then you change your name, people who, who fuck are you, you know? Yeah. You could, you could fuck yourself up cause we learn from scratch. You were what you were seven years in when I already, whatever you do, don't hyphenate that shit. God damn cop out. I knew a dude who hyphenated and he took the wife's name last won, somebody lost, somebody failed. We're not doing it yet.

Speaker 1:          00:15:49       He was also a self proclaimed feminist who was a male feminist. Really leave that can exist, but I don't know. I feel like the concept of feminists any more than I liked the concept of masculine as don't have to concept of someone's masculine centric. That's ridiculous. Who the fuck is more masculine centric than me? I mean everything I do is meet, had shit, fucking cage fighting a choke and people smoking weed. He's talking about tags. Come on, man, but I don't want to just be, I'm not only concerned with men, I'm concerned what the whole fucking human race. As soon as you start going, oh me, you like to dance. I danced my ass off. I didn't take dancing classes of that movie. I did a dance scene. A zookeeper. That's awesome. With the lovely Leslie Bibb, the the gorgeous blonde woman from Talladega nights. Yeah. She played my who say cool.

Speaker 1:          00:16:38       Rarely. Rarely get to act and that of my scenes are with her and Rosario, Doris Dawson and Kevin James. I was like, ah, that's so cool. Yeah, she was really funny. She's hauling changes. All those scenes. I could tell you some shit that this chick would say, well, we're hanging around like in between scenes were in the van on the way. She's fucking hilarious. But at a respect for her and I would not repeat anything she said. Sure, sure. Oh, that must be really funny. She's hilarious. She's like a comic. She's like a female comic. That's great. She's hilarious and cool as fuck. You're very balanced. You, you like these Alpha male things. But I find you to be very balanced and you appreciate. Well, I still need the Alpha male stuff. You know what it all, I mean, I wouldn't say Alpha male stuff, just masculine type things.

Speaker 1:          00:17:23       I'd slept, but I'd like, why? Why, why? Why am I supposed to pretend that I don't like something? I like loud mustangs. I like when you rev the engine, it's stupid. He goes, no, I have a Mustang and I'd love, it's my favorite car. It's the dumbest car. Hap. Yeah. Well, you know what's good about it? It's loud as fuck. And it's stupid. And I like listening to Leonard Skinner did music in that fucking loud and you know, yeah. You can go look at her, you fucking loser. I don't care. That's that is what I liked. I liked MMA.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       I like playing pool until fucking six o'clock in the morning. These are the things I actually enjoy. I mean I'm not, I'm not going to pretend that I don't, cause I did for a long time in my life when I was growing up though, I always felt like there was something wrong with me. You know, like first of all, I grew up in Boston, which is a very pussy whipped town. I mean it's a very manly town, but there's not a lot of women there. And especially amongst quote unquote intellectuals, you know, it's mean if you did hanging around college people, the amount of colleges per capita is really high. It's like one of the, the, the highest numbers in the country. Then Boston one I think ridiculous. And so most people are really educated. Most people intelligence. And when you get like a lot of educated, intelligent people and they're trying to impress people, they tend to go towards the super liberal.

Speaker 2:          00:18:34       They tend to go towards the, you know, the, there's something wrong with you. You're a barbarian, you need to evolve. They tend to get, like you would tell someone that you, you do martial arts and they would look at you like you're insecure. Like there's something wrong with you for pursuing that and this is something you need to get past. Like I've had those conversations with people where they judge you for the things he enjoyed doing. And what they're basically trying to do is they look, no one wants to fucking run hills. No one wants to, you know, beat a, a t a tire with a sledgehammer. No ones wants to do rounds on the bag. No one wants to take class and fucking strangle people for hours and hours. But the only way to get good at all that stuff is to do that. So if you can persuade other people to not get good at all the things that make you uncomfortable, then you don't have to feel as uncomfortable.

Speaker 2:          00:19:17       So if everybody was scrawny and sick and smoked cigarettes and drank whiskey all day, you wouldn't have to worry about getting your ass kicked. And ultimately that's one of the reasons how, one of the things, when the motivations for people, when they do like get upset at people for liking other things, you know, if you, if you actually love, what do you like hot rods, what's, what are you doing stupid? You're like hot rods and big dogs big here. But the people that say that are always the, the like the, if they're that critical about what you enjoy is because they're less happy. It takes you a while to realize that though. I thought they were right and they would be angry and critical with me about things and I would think that they were right and I would say, wow, you know, maybe I'm a, and then I would then eventually it took me a while ago.

Speaker 2:          00:19:56       Why do they care? It took me a while to go, why are they giving me a hard time for things that I enjoy? If I like listening to kiss, I like kiss. Yeah, I'll be in my car. Come on and sing along. I fucking sing along as you think. I think most people don't get to that. I think it is something you start to figure it out as you get older. But then I was having this thought literally earlier today. Don't you ever look back and think about people that like we're in high school with you, that you feel like had that clarity, but you don't realize it til you're older. You're like that person's disposition and they're credible at like 15. Yeah. I think it's their parents. Yeah. And if you grow up in an environment where your parents or your parents don't buy the bullshit, it's way easier to not buy the bullshit, you know? You know, my parents were very unusual. My Dad is, uh, my stepfather Hippie, and he was a computer program and then an architect is a very, very bright guy who was always, you know, a pot smoker too when I was young. Yeah. Tell you like him or would you smoke with him or smoked with him? When I was eight.

Speaker 3:          00:20:56       Hey. Hey,

Speaker 2:          00:20:58       just once to see what it was like. Cause I asked him, I'm like, what are you doing? We guys are smoking pot. What does that? And he goes, you want to try it? And I go, can I? He goes, yeah, it goes just a little, but you can try it. And they gave me, I don't remember the effects. I don't remember what happened. Probably fucked my brain up from life. Yeah. But I was taught or really early on to don't don't believe the hype. You know that there's a, there's a lot out there that's bullshit, you know? Yeah. A lot of laws that he like I would, I would give it, I got confused about something being illegal. I'm like, but it's illegal. This is illegal. And you know, my stepfather was always like, let me tell you something. That laws that are not there to protect people, they don't, they don't need to be there.

Speaker 2:          00:21:35       Those are, those laws are nonsense. And it was a, it was a really interesting way he put it, the laws that don't protect anybody or just bullshit laws. And I was like, wow, what the fuck ever thought like hitting. Then it really is when you really start to think about like personal choice laws. Like I remember in New York he couldn't get tattooed, like tattoos were illegal. Like for awhile, back in the 90s I had to go to Connecticut to get a tattoo and I was like, how fucking stupid is this? You know, this is the one I grew up in in Boston, kickboxing was illegal. We used to have to go to Rhode Island to fight. We can fight in taekwondo tournament's in Massachusetts, but we had to go to Rhode Island to find like why? What did, the more laws there are, the more problems there are.

Speaker 2:          00:22:10       Let people figure out what the fuck they like, let them pursue it. Cool. We got way too much. We have way too many laws and we have way too many people that have a career in pro. Not just protecting these laws, but enforcing these laws and building more laws. It's like there's a whole business. It's like, well, you know, where are we says people always say kill the lawyers first. Oh No. It's like it's really is ridiculous when they can catch little imperfections in the text, in the, in the language of things are written and they can exploit these things and it's like why is everything so fucking complex? It is.

Speaker 3:          00:22:43       Or the the lawsuit. Yeah to sue somebody over. You know in Hungary there's a, there's an amusement park that other roller coasters made out of wood and it doesn't even stop to let you on. That was from like the Russian and it's the most fun and scary as Shit fucking die. And how slow does it go? Does it get on maybe like five down to five and you literally like the people in it jump off and then the fucking bar doesn't even come down on your lap. It's like this and you better hold the fuck on cause you're going to get, well you think anybody sues the amusement park if they fall up? No. It's your fault dummy. Who wrote the,

Speaker 2:          00:23:19       I think you should be able to sue for certain things. I certainly think they should fix the fucking rollercoaster. That that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that there's a lot of laws like that that are in place that just don't need to be right. Sometimes things are just common sense and public opinion and you know, it's common sense and not buy crack. If you want crack, you can get crack. Yeah. Cracks, illegal use. No, there's no crack. Uh, uh, people that are out the street protesting why crack isn't legal. There's nothing. You know, there's no crack advocates. There's no crack legislators, you know, but you can go get it. If you want to go get it, you can go get it. You want to really, do you want to arrest the guy who's selling it? That's poor fuck that's running around selling crack, which you need to do is make treatment centers and need to do is find out what the fuck happened on this poor kid that he thinks it's okay to sell crack.

Speaker 2:          00:24:04       You know? I mean, that's the real fundamental problem. Anybody look, I don't know anybody. If I said, hey man, I'm gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna sell something that makes your Dick fall off. You know they, they know it's going to make their dick fall off, but we're going to sell it anyway. Are you down? He went down and make some money. I don't know a single person that would go, what make people's Dick fall off? Fuck. So why? Why? If you wouldn't do that, and would you sell crack, then would you sell something that's going to ruin people's lives? Of course you wouldn't. There's no way you would do that. You'd nobody would want that over their head. And even if it was a lot of money, man, you'd consider it because you really do hate to be broke. You don't want to do anything.

Speaker 2:          00:24:38       Ultimately, that ruins lives. So that's the real issue. The real issue is why are these people willing to sell crack? Why are these people willing to put other people's lives and put themselves and their wants and their selfish desires ahead of all these other people's lives? There's, that's the real prosperity. Real world, not the crack is legal so that anybody would want crack the rib. Real root of the problem is not the cracks illegal. It's that. Why would anybody want crack? That's the real problem. The real problem is who's who's educating the children, who's raising them, who was exposing them certain things she was protecting them. Who's making sure that you develop a person that doesn't have anger and hate and selfishness inside them to the point where they want to sell people poison. There's poison that they're addicted to. A lot of shitty parents, a lot of shitty parents, man.

Speaker 2:          00:25:25       That is the real root of the issue. That's the real, real root of the issue to everyday. You see it in adults, you go and you can tell right away like you had a really bad, but you see it when you have kids and your kids or run other people's kids. You see people fucking scream at kids when you know where they learn that shit from. You know, you see them angry and hit each other with sticks and shit. You know, you see weird shit with kids that you know is from, it's going on at home. Did you see that video of that lady, young girl getting beat by her father was a judge? I saw that dude, you don't even want to watch it. It's horrendous. She was 16 at the time and her dad is a judge in Texas and he had a family planning judge and he beat her with a belt for downloading shit off the internet.

Speaker 2:          00:26:09       I think she downloaded some illegal stuff off the internet. Like you know, the songs was a music. So she downloaded illegal, he beat her with a fucking belt. I mean beat her like full blast whips and he's yelling, I didn't get my Lickin, I didn't get my licking. And this is a guy who did not know he was recording. Right. And we're being recorded, right? So this is what this guy's like. That's when it's really terrifying when you see people behind their mask, you know, this guy is, uh, his mask is that he's a judge and bit, by the way, they're not even going to pursue charges against this guy. This is the same statute. And talk about laws or statue of limitations on that kid. That's insane. That's a assault. One of the David just beating your kid. We used a weapon like I should be in jail forever.

Speaker 2:          00:26:52       Fuck him. You, you pussy. You hit a little girl with a belt because what? Because your life is frustrating because you're getting old cause your Dick doesn't work anymore. Which is it? Which is it that causes you to pull the trigger on beating your fucking baby with a belt? Oh my God. I would never stop hitting that guy if I saw that happen. I would never stop hitting that guy. I would never run out of one more. I would just keep giving them one more. Fuck you. You want to beat a baby with a belt of girl? You fucking piece of shit that that could even be argued that that guy's not a plague. A blight on society. You fucking shithead. You could do that to your daughter, man. Shun you. You Fuck? You should live on a mountain now. No one should talk to you.

Speaker 2:          00:27:41       You should be locked up in a fucking cage. Fuck you mad if files too for that. Yeah. This fucking the Sandusky thing. It's a joke. Paternal thing. Holy Shit is this dark. You know what's really crazy? The guy who found him and turn him in, his name is Mick Query. It's almost like this is fiction. It's almost like the world is becoming more and more one becoming as 2012 comes along, the story falls apart. The plot starts to reveal itself. The writing behind the script. Look, the guy named wiener was a politician who was sending pictures of his dick to girls online and thought he could get away with it. I mean, what rush limbo takes so many oxycontin's. He goes deaf. Why? That was the best writes. What? And His guy, Macquarie finds the most beloved football coach ever is guilty of shielding another beloved assistant coach from fucking little boys for 20 years. This guy was taking these kids on fucking trips. They were staying with him. He was bone, a little boys for years, and they allowed him to, they allowed him to. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:28:59       I mean, I don't know what the solution needs to be killed. You have to kill them that they've destroyed lives. I don't think. I think people would forfeit their right to live, reparable, destroyed. All those boys. That guy fucked will never be the boy did. They could have been without getting fucked by that guy. That guy owes a hundred lives cause he owes more than he owes 100,000 lives because he goes every live to these poor fucked up kids are going to interact with and perhaps molests boys because of what happened to them. But that happens with that. That's why it happens in the first place. ABS. So this guy, this motherfucker called it caused a ripple effect and this Macquarie Guy who still has his job, even though he didn't go running to the police, you know, everybody wanted to keep their job, it seems, it

Speaker 5:          00:29:41       seems like they were, they were shooting this guy and everybody wanted to keep the job, but the guy who saw the boy getting fucked in the ass should a rent straight to the police. But that's not what happened. They weren't fucking just horsing around. They were just sliding on the floor. Guys story is, they heard a rhythmic slapping and came in to see a 10 year old boy with his hands on the wall. Well, this guy was fucking his little boy ass. Whoa. Did you see the development today as far as the email? No. So McCreary sent out an email to friends and they had excerpts of it on the news that said that he said, you guys know I didn't just turn and run away like they're saying I, you know, I had to make quick decisions. I made sure it stopped. So he was saying that because there was make sure it stopped but fall fucking pedophile suggested that he entered intervened at that moment.

Speaker 5:          00:30:38       Uh, intervene. Well stopped it. In other words, the first reports said that he walked away. Right. He and his email is saying I didn't just see it and walk away. I, I stopped it from, I stopped what was happening. Okay. So his old version, did he say why he didn't go to the cops? No, cause it's just they just got a copy of an email he sent to friends. It doesn't, it doesn't go into these, how did he not go to the cops? That's the part that people are saying that he went to his father and then the next day he went to his father. He went to his own father to tell him what happened and then the next day he went to Puerto Rico and then Pitino told the athletic director and maybe the president or the athletic director told the president was that guy as a guy who's trying to keep his fucking job, and that's pretty gross, grows with that guy supposed to do is called the cops.

Speaker 5:          00:31:29       Immediately. Everybody needs that call is to the cop and you don't let that motherfucker leave. Yeah, you don't let that motherfucker leave. You beat that old man's senseless. You leave her there and then you call the cops. Then old fucking creep. Fucking that 10 year old boy, you're supposed to want to be violent because if you have a tribe, okay, it's a tribe of a few people that they care about each other and protect each other from all the other fucking terrible things in the world. When you find something like that, that's God damn disease. The real problem is that we have so many people, there's so many people, there's 300 plus million of us on this one continent. And because of that, not even one continent, one piece of the contract in America, you know, and because of that we've, we devalue each other man.

Speaker 5:          00:32:13       We don't appreciate each other and we don't appreciate threats like that. Threats become over there. They're a threat over there. We can separate from it. I live in a gated community. I closed my door at night and turn on my alarm system. I have a gun. I'm not worried. You know, we, we, we need to get rid of all those problems. And if you, if you had a community and you had a guy like this paternal fuck who allowed this other fuck to bang little kids in the asshole and didn't have him locked in a

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       cage, you're supposed to tell the both of them. You are not, you're not looking after the community. You guys were looking out for your own asses. All of you from the guy who caught him, who didn't go to the cops, to, to the paternal guy knew. They all fucking know. You can't be around a dude who's banging kids in the ass and not, no, you cannot. How this guy's taking little boys on the road with them. I mean, it's really dark. He had a fucking, yes, he had a charity to help little kids that were like underprivileged or in, in, you know, troubled homes. And you know, it's the craziest thing. But there was a, some priests that had written some stuff about finding boys. It was really dark shit. And it was, um, uh, like shared emails back and forth. But one of the things that they were saying was that, look for boys with troubled childhoods.

Speaker 2:          00:33:27       Look for boys who don't have a good relationship with their parents. And those are the ones they prey on. The boys who are lost and alone because they're vulnerable and they'll do anything for love, you know, and they don't even know while they're, while they're having sex with a man, they just know that they're happy, that this man cares about them because the people, the orphanage, don't you know that this man is buying them toys. So he would do this, he would buy them toys, he would take them to fucking to games. He would do all these things and bone them. It's like classic priests Shit. It's the classic preciate it

Speaker 5:          00:33:55       the level, the level of planning an evil like it goes into, I'm going to set up a foundation, a charitable foundation for troubled and we're trying them and were convicting them right here on the show. And I know that's wrong. We can assume, I know that's wrong, but if that Sandusky guy isn't, if he's not well arrested and that the Macquarie Guy, how is he not in jail? I don't understand that. That tell you since Sandusky didn't do himself any favors with that, uh, that interview that he did on air yesterday with Bob Costas at all because, oh my God. When like there's just, you get it. Can you get it Brian? Pull it out.

Speaker 5:          00:34:36       Let's see. Yeah, I mean there's the, first of all, they're stuffy volunteers, which if you have doubts, you should probably have far less doubts. Laughter. It was on NBC. It was on a rock center, uh, with Brian Williams. Dusky yeah. It's um, there's certain things like if, I don't know it, was it Matt Lauer who, no, it was Bob Costas. Oh, Bob Costas. He's even better. He's tremendous cautious. A brilliant man. Very smart guys. His grasp of the English language really makes you feel, yeah. He's a great guy. I don't know words. He beat me. He beat me up on news radio. He did. Yeah. We had seen a fight scene was radio and he flipped me. He flipped me off the ground. He's bringing by us. He's a brother. Yeah, we had, I got a chance to talk to him all night. It was really cool. Very smart guy. Well, there's just things like, I mean, I don't know if we're going to get the interview or not, but like when you, you know, when you're asked a, are you a pet, are you sexually attracted to young boys? What do you think? Like somebody who isn't, what would they say? What's, no fuck no. Okay. Well, what about am I attracted sexually? I mean, I'm not sexually define attractive. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:35:47       Can I just bring up an Oprah Winfrey thing? I learned on the Oprah show the web is buzzing of the cost. This is telephone interview with Jerry Sandusky speaking for the first time. Since then.

Speaker 5:          00:36:00       It is then it seemed like it's a right, it's a report on this is, this is not it, the interview. No, they're talking about the interview. Yeah. That's not it. Obviously just look for the interview. Yeah, the audio is amazing. It's incredible.

Speaker 3:          00:36:13       Molested and uh, and she had this whole segment where she brought pedophiles on the show and they actually got to say how they court these children, why they do it in any way. Basically they groom children, like you said, the vulnerable ones. They can tell which boys or girls or psychologically fragile and they groom them. So like you said, that's what that's called, where they give them the candy and the courtship and actually family members to my last a lot. She's like, if you have an uncle that like is really into hanging out with your girls, like how loosened on my lab or that, that's actually how it happens. It's the neighbor, it's the uncle. It's not the stranger. It's actually people that, you know, what the fuck is Redman? I think it's like a faulty products, you know? Is this, it sounds like it

Speaker 6:          00:37:03       innocence, completely innocent and falsely accused in every aspect.

Speaker 7:          00:37:09       Good question. Well, I could say that, you know, I have done some of those things. I have horsed around with kids. I have showered after workouts, I have hugged them and I've, I haven't touched her leg without intent of sexual contact. But, um, so if, if you look at it that way, um, there are things that wouldn't, you know, it would be accurate.

Speaker 6:          00:37:42       Are you denying that you had any inappropriate sexual contact with any of these under race?

Speaker 7:          00:37:47       Boy, yes. I am

Speaker 6:          00:37:49       never touched their genitals. Never engaged in oral sex. Right. Wow. What about Mike Macquarie, the Grad assistant who in 2002 walked into the shower where he says in specific be 10 or 11 years old that his hands were up against the shower wall and he heard rhythmic slap, slap slapping sounds and he described that as a rape.

Speaker 7:          00:38:15       I would say that that's false.

Speaker 6:          00:38:17       What would be his motive to lie?

Speaker 7:          00:38:20       You'd have to ask him that.

Speaker 6:          00:38:22       What did happen in the shower the night that Mike Macquarie happened upon you and the young boy.

Speaker 7:          00:38:29       Okay. And we will rush showering and, and horsing around and he actually all the shower's on and was, uh, actually sliding across the, uh, the floor. And, um, and we were, as I recall, possibly like snapping a towel. Horseplay

Speaker 6:          00:38:49       in 1998 mother confronts you about taking a shower with her son and inappropriately touching him. Two detectives eavesdrop on our conversations with you and you admit that maybe your private parts touched her son. What happened there?

Speaker 7:          00:39:07       Well, I can't exactly recall what was said there, uh, in terms of, um, what I did say was that if he felt that way then I was wrong.

Speaker 6:          00:39:26       During one of those conversations, you said, I understand I was wrong. I wish I could get forgiveness speaking now with the mother. I know I won't get it from you. I wish I were dead. A guy falsely accused or a guy whose actions have been misinterpreted doesn't respond that way. Does he?

Speaker 7:          00:39:46       I don't know. I didn't say to my recollection, I wish I were dead. Uh, I, I was hopeful that we call the reconcile things.

Speaker 6:          00:39:59       Shortly after that in 2000, a janitor said that he saw you performing oral sex on a young boy in the showers, in the Penn state locker facility. Did that happen?

Speaker 7:          00:40:10       No.

Speaker 6:          00:40:12       How could somebody think they saw something as extreme, as shocking as that when it hadn't occurred and what would possibly be their motivation to fabricate it?

Speaker 7:          00:40:22       You didn't have to ask them.

Speaker 6:          00:40:25       It seems that if all of these accusations are false, you are the unluckiest and most persecuted man that any of us has ever heard about.

Speaker 7:          00:40:41       What you want me to say? I don't think that these have been the best days of my life.

Speaker 5:          00:40:47       Sandusky's attorney Joseph Amendola insist the charges filed by the Pennsylvania girl pregnant. You got a teenager pregnancy a few days ago. Come out, he 49 now you can kill it. 49 years old. He got a teenager pregnant. Yeah, it goes on. It goes on. It's a of the feather, but like doesn't let you think he's not. I mean like if you're like, I think you're totally right that you, that you shouldn't, you know, convict somebody just when charges. But then like if you did have your doubts, does that make them fade away? That this guy's a creep? No. No question about it. That's not how you respond. I of course not you people that are guilty, that are pretending to not be guilty, it never realize how other people see them. They always just tried to, you know, stay

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       calm and keep it together. You would be freaking the fuck out if that was you. And all of a sudden someone was saying that Thomson [inaudible] has been touching little kids. I'm blowing him in a bathroom. You would go crazy. You wouldn't be, you'd have to ask them. You wouldn't. You wouldn't. There's no fucking way you would leave it at. You'd have to ask them now. He could be like, I have no idea. This is horrifying. I, you know, this is not only that, it's, it's, it's put me in this terrible position where it'll never be erased from some people's memories that have heard this. It's a terrifying thing. You know, if you think someone falsely accusing you of being a child molester like this, you know, if someone was really falsely accusing you would be, you would be trapped. It'd be like raging. You'd be like, I haven't done anything.

Speaker 2:          00:42:18       What the fuck is going on? And people have been falsely accused before for sure. I would like to see how they react because then it doesn't sound like that. Do you know of any popular cases? I just assumed. Oh Brian. I just assumed that people have been, I mean especially, I mean I'm sure it's happened and molestation and murder ones that always like it blows my mind when you see like DNA exonerates somebody and they serve. Like that person was in prison for 20 years of their life in the hardcore prison for like murders and rapes and the whole time he was like, I didn't murder somebody. Everybody was like sure I can asshole. Like I'm sure you didn't. Did you see that guy that fought under card? Oh my gosh, she's got no, it wasn't mean. It wasn't, it wasn't like a week or two before.

Speaker 2:          00:43:09       It was this guy was 52 years old. He'd just gotten out of jail where he was in jail for I think 29 years for a crime he didn't commit. He got sad, so scary. He was boxing champ like inside and he be one is to come back by 52 years old professional box and you actually look really good for a 52 year old is in good shape to, I saw a piece on him before the fight and just how he wasn't wanting to kill everybody in the world even though like, I can't imagine the anger you got to have that you got, how long would it take him to be saying again? You know, man, how long would it take him to bounce back? That's a, that's a long Goddamn road. Like a great attitude. Way better attitude than people who haven't served 29 years.

Speaker 2:          00:43:58       Incredible. I wonder how he pulled it together like that. I Dunno. I really don't know. Yeah, it's really sad. That's, and that's the one reason why I'm not 100% for capital punishment for capital punishment when you absolutely know. But the reality is, man, there've been bad cops just like there've been bad postmen, like there's been, don't you think people would, uh, not be like, you know, there's a segment of people who oppose the death penalty for crimes you can commit now, don't you think people would be, there'd be less people opposed to it if it were for like child molestation? Like if you're like, that's a punishable by death crime

Speaker 8:          00:44:32       now don't think less, but you'd have to prove that the person was 100% if they weren't, if they were approved 100% yeah, people would probably, well, you know what? I think it would be harder to get people to pull the trigger for trauma molesting because a lot of people have creepy uncles that they love that are probably did. So there's, I think it's more prevalent

Speaker 9:          00:44:50       in our society than we'd like to admit. And it really is a symptom and a side effect of the sexual repression that we all enjoy in this country. You know,

Speaker 8:          00:44:58       they're wired that way. If you're a kink, is that, it's unfortunate because how do you express that cat? I think,

Speaker 9:          00:45:06       I think at the root of a lot of really fucked up deviant behavior is a lack of sexual choices and a lack of uh, sexual education and a, that the fact that it's dirty, the fact that sex is forbidden, the fact that it's something that you feel like you're getting away with when you do it. And then you add to that fucked up people that molest kids and he throw that all in a big batch together and then you have these kids that grow up with this fucked up memory and they repeat the same behavior over and over again. And what is the root cause of it? I mean all of it has got to be like shitty parenting, shitty parenting and the kid being the less right. That's, that's the root of all of it. But also, you know, it has to, there should be a little bit more knowledge. We, we should, we should be a little bit more open about what the fuck is going on sexually with people like in high school. Do you think they have classes where they talk about people that are trying just trying to fuck you. Do you think they have

Speaker 8:          00:45:59       class like that where they say, Hey look this guy with candy and the open van who's just trying to fuck you so you understand he may just trying to fuck you in your ass. Wouldn't it be great to tell like 10 year olds really should know right there cause otherwise the first time they get raped or like what the fuck drug, drug resistance education. All it did was teach me what drugs I wanted to do when I was old enough to do them. It didn't really teach me shit. Remember when you had to pass around the fake drugs that look like actually was real stuff that the police had confiscated and you're like sitting there looking at real weed when you were like 12 going wow this is cool looking but I've never seen this plant so my brother's gone wouldn't have been more valuable if they were like, hey if some guy tries to fuck you in a van run. But there used to be, don't ever trust any, any adults by themselves and wants to take you somewhere. Danger, danger, danger. Don't talk to strangers. Don't open the door if you're alone. So there is every now and then

Speaker 9:          00:47:01       you'll see someone somewhere. So I'm fucking sketchy looking at person and you just,

Speaker 8:          00:47:05       but it is, I do think it is the, uh, it is the like unacceptable, unfixable kink. It is like, I think it's like pro, there's hard wiring and there are some products that you like, this thing was done fucking broken. It's a broken person and there's really no cause everything else. If you're like, this is what arouses me there, you can get your, but this is the one that's like, I can't, sorry. Yeah, you can't. And it's a psychological too. It's my, it might

Speaker 9:          00:47:30       not even be sexual. So like making them impotent might not even do it. Right. They might still want to touch the kids and do, who knows? I don't know. I don't know if it's psychological or it's just purely sexual, you know? I think it's a, it's a weird fucking obsession. Yeah. Terrifying. Terrible, terrible obsession. You know, and it's, it needs to be fixed. It needs to, you know, someone needs to figure out a way to fix that. I think probably there is a way with psychedelic drugs, but they haven't pursued it enough to figure out like what's the right dose and how to administer it correctly. Like if you give someone like a, if someone's like a child molester or someone's done something fucked up and you give them like a heavy, heavy dose of Iowasca or heavy dose of Ibogaine or something like that, my guarantee you there'd be so disappointed and disgusted with themselves.

Speaker 9:          00:48:12       They do, they kill themselves or they would never ever do it again. Really? Yeah, I think so. I think, uh, I think that's true with a lot of people, a large percentage of the population. I think most people, you know, like when a guy said he wanted to kill himself, I wish I was dead, you know, that's what they think. That's what they think. They, they don't want to live this way. They're just stuck in this goddamn feedback loop, this horrible loop that they got in as a small child. That Sanduski guy's probably molested Williams a kid. Yes, sure. Probably by another football coach or something like that that I saw a story that uh, his parents started like a home for kids and he lived in that home growing up. Oh, Bingo. Well there you go. That's where he got it. Yeah. Yeah. He got it either from one of those kids that he went to in the home with, cause a lot of those had been molested.

Speaker 9:          00:48:55       If you're going to share a home with troubled children. Yeah. A lot of their troubles or sexual, you know, God damn it man. Yeah. God Damn it man. Yeah. And you know what, while this fucked up country is overseas steel and heroin and minerals in Afghanistan and pretending that it's for our greater good, they could be over here and trying to fix the real problem in this country, which is fucking the youth. The real problem is, are the, the, the, the quality of our fucking plants that are growing, the quality of our seeds. That had been planted, the quality of the human beings that are developing right now, and for a good percentage of them, it's a fucking mess and no one wants to fix that. Could you imagine if we had an entire country of people that lived in a good neighborhood, the entire country of people that lived in a place where you didn't have to worry about your kids getting fucked by some creepy man, you know, in the Netherlands even there. Awesome. Well sort of, but even there that look the Netherlands in Holland, a lot of crazy shit goes on in Holland. You know how is a dark place globe trotters know enough about it. Yeah. The Red Light district, all those words just

Speaker 3:          00:49:56       for tourists. I don't think that the native Dutch, I was just there like a few weeks ago and just stand up out there. Yeah. Yes. For like some, some showtime thing and there was, the natives were saying like, we don't go to those places. The Dutch were actually conservative people socially or it's a business thing. They realize that that's what attracts us. Dopey Americans. Woo. You can smoke dope in public and we can fuck hookers. And it's so, it's so crazy to us how we can have sex and we can do all these things and, and that's why we go over there and do that. Or an

Speaker 9:          00:50:28       English boy hall is not an innocent place though by any stretch of the imagination run wild ass place to, you know, do you know that's where some of the best kickboxing and the world comes from? Is that Dutch? Yeah. Yeah. Boy Tie in in Holland. Is that some of the highest level in the world? A lot of fighters from other countries go to Holland to train in kickboxing. I had no idea. Yeah, there's a great culture, great culture of a kickboxers from that part of the world that there was a few guys back in the day and you know, there's a bunch of them that came successful. It's particularly this Guy Ramon Dekkers who went over to Thailand and fought like the best ties in the world. And he was a small guy. So he's the size of the ties. And then there was a guy named rob came in and rob came in was a larger, bigger guy.

Speaker 9:          00:51:15       You met rob, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a bigger guy. It's like it would hurt. He's, he probably the best kickboxer that ever lived. Really? Yeah. And he's a real super technical and he's from, from Holland as well. They're all crazy. They're wild wild people, man. Yeah. To Fund people. Did you see that sports science on Bas Rutten's kicks? Oh yeah, yeah. Ridiculous. They were like, this is all wrong. All the readings are off. He'll hurt. And then he did it again. Your insights are being traumatized. Paint if you get kicked by this guy, oh yeah. Boss route and can kick fucking hard. And he was one of the first guys in, uh, in mixed martial arts fighting. It was really fighting in an organization called pancreas, which was sort of a hybrid. It wasn't quite mixed martial arts. He had weird rules. You could kick full blast but you couldn't punch to the face.

Speaker 9:          00:51:59       You could only slap to the face. You get to like pull your hands back and use open palm strikes. But with boss route and figured out how to do is pull his hands way back, had like really flexible risks. So really it was punching you with his palm. So because with most guys they were like slapping, which doesn't have the same impact, but boss was doing, he was pulling his hands way back like this and he was throwing punches. He was the first guy to figure out that he could throw punches with his palms and he was fucking people up. You would kick them and you would just go, whoa, nobody kicks that hard. In the, in this style of fighting, he was kicking like a real powerful Moy Thai guy would kick anybody who was applying that in MMA. He was one of the first guys.

Speaker 9:          00:52:40       One of the first pioneers. Yeah. It's a crazy God damn sport. The sport of fighting. It's crazy to brag, but I studied Kung Fu for two years, Susan Griffith Park and I'm like, Gee, I did. My teacher taught us, says Muy Thai kicks, and she said that they get like callouses on their shins sort of deal. Yeah. They get kind of numb. A lot of guys have like bumps in knots and shit from me. You know, you get like bloody spots and bruises and the heal up and gets tough. Eventually. Some guys even kick a bamboo trees and shit. The cake, banana trees and the kicker just to kind of, you know, it Kinda has some give to it, but it's still pretty hard. It does feel good to kick stuff hard. God dammit. Just dammit. Just

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       do you think about Tom Mommy? It's just, Oh yes. Whatever. No I don't. I don't treat you like the enemy. I don't have any.

Speaker 9:          00:53:31       How come you guys get along so well as a couple as comics? Because a lot of them like you guys are genuinely happy. Neither one of you guys just like tortured, you know, and you, you seem like better together. You actually seen better together. We all have the friend that when they're with their other, they're different. Oh, I know. Isn't that sad? Sad? I think it's sad to watch. Yeah. I have a, I have a buddy that can't do anything right. When he's with his girl. She's always, what are you putting it there for? What? What does that, why is it going to be here? Sit down. What time is it? You are you ready? Yeah, always. There's always a nag in there. But you guys are like buddies. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:54:06       You know why though? I think some women, they make their spouse the enemy for some reason they're unhappy with something inside of them. But with Tommy I think, I dunno, I'm in therapy. I go to psychotherapy. Yeah. When I work out my shit and I, you know, I do it professionally and also like, cause we're both comics. Like I just did. I think Tommy is way funnier than me and I accept that and I like him commute. I mean like I respect you as a comic and I respect you as a person.

Speaker 9:          00:54:35       Yeah. So that's why, you know, as long as he's the fucking man. Yeah. Dude, it's awesome. Right? No. You Kiss, you just kissing, all sang. Yeah. What are you going to say? Maybe around man, they just, oh those are cute. No, but that was beautiful. You know what other thing that people ask me all the time, they're like, are you guys a competitive? And I'm like, what? No. Like I guess cause comics sort of inherently are competitive but like, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:55:04       In a relationship that's way different. Yeah. Some people that's their whole thing, their whole thing. The female comedians are considered novelty acts. Like I'm, I think there's still enough sexism in comedy where people were like, are you guys ready for a lady comic? And I'm like, the circus act right. In a normal lineup. So, uh, my career and what I'm trying to say is never going to conflict with Tommy. He's like, it's preposterous to think that

Speaker 9:          00:55:28       we're controlling for the same. No one competes with it. Right. And that too. Yeah. You have to realize that somewhere along the line that you, when your friends do better, you do better everybody together. But you, y'all go grow together. But everybody gets fucking selfish and they don't want their friends. I mean, I know a lot of comics that, I mean, we all know a lot of comics that they don't like the other people around them. To be funny. Oh sure. You want to hold everything everybody back because somehow or another they feel like it makes them not funny. You know? Like I remember I had a conversation with somebody and they were saying, wow, fuck, do you take Joey d as in a row with Umass? So funny. He's so funny. He's ridiculous. I was like, cause he's hilarious. Yeah, we'll kind of stupid question is that like, but to them it was, there was ridiculous.

Speaker 9:          00:56:08       Like what they did, and this was a headliner. I was talking to a national guy and what he does is take a fucking terrible comedian on the road with them. And a terrible comedian would go on there and eat his own dick for 20 minutes. And then he'll go out, look, our goddamn hero who rescue at the bar has been lowered. People are looking to laugh. So he has a couple inferior comedians on before him. And then he goes out there and he looks like a fucking Superhero, you know? But when they see someone doing well, they start thinking these terrible thoughts. This person's gonna ooze usurped my power. They're going to, people are going to be seeing them. I'm going to be opening them up for him and they start thinking crazy, man. And it's crazy. It's stupid. It's a dumb thing to do. It's a trap. You can never be jealous. You can only be inspired if you want to feel any negativity. Just fucking push it aside, ignore it, rejected, refuse it and just say, man, how awesome is that guy? I wish I was that funny. You know, I'm going to write more. You know, I want to go do this.

Speaker 5:          00:57:02       I think that both Christina and I both always been the type of person that likes having funny people around. Like we genuinely enjoy funny people and we never like, even when they're like huge personality, cause neither one of us has huge like overbearing personalities. The people. So especially like offstage when I'm around like, well I feel like when I'm around like Joey Diaz, like a fucking movie is playing like somebody who's pressing play on fucking funny movie. How am I not going to like, I'm going to watch him. I said, I've, I've been at your shows were, um, were backstage. I pull up a chair and I'm like, so have you ever been asked him a question? Have you ever been to Phoenix? And he's like, Phoenix. And he starts on us and we tell you something about it. We were robbing us. Guy Phoenix are like, [inaudible] don't want a cap gun and fly on his ass. Yeah. Like, I mean, you ended up, my nose was bleeding those up for three days. You know, this dog deposes gone. Not only is it like, not threatening, it's like the biggest joy of a night or you ask stupid Burke.

Speaker 10:         00:58:05       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:58:09       And he tells you, it's like, he's like having a fucking TV on. How about a show going on? Constantly. Yeah. That's how I feel about it though. We always, I always feel like Joey's like a show that we bring with us. He brings the party, he brings the party. That's why he goes up first to, yeah. I mean, he's a goddamn national headliner. You know what I mean? Joey, Joey's one of the best comics in the country. And he goes on first. And the reason why it goes on for, cause he wants to, he wants to go out there dancing and he brings a party, you know, and he likes it. And he also likes the challenge of warming a room up. You know, it helps, it makes it material stronger. Joey's really calculated about his comedy. You know, you would think that being this wild, crazy guy that he, you know, he's Kinda just kind of wings it, but he also thinks about it a lot.

Speaker 9:          00:58:46       You know, he has a lot of thought behind his comedy and he, you know, he thinks that it's good for your comedy to go up cold like that. He likes to do it for sure. You know what I'm saying? He used to do it in Boston. Yeah. I was just talking to a buddy about this. Like they used to do a a night, like they would do like dawn Gavin's show and Don Galvin was a national headliner and one of the biggest acts in Boston. And he would go on stage first and it was his show and he would be the host of the show. And so he would bring up like if we did like we're going to do Thursday night at the icehouse again this week. So if you're around, come on down bitches. Cause it's a party. It's an awesome show. It's a really, really intimate only 85 seats and a it sold out last week.

Speaker 9:          00:59:25       It'll probably saw it this week too. And who else is doing it? Brian, I'm going to announce the whole lamp tomorrow by John Reape is going to do it. Your friend Yoshi and I got some other secrets to hilarious dude. It was a blast. So fun. So cool. Yeah, this is awesome. As crowd the best. Yeah. Yeah. Just the best. They're on board from the first minute. Yeah. They're so cool. You know I, that's the, the, the greatest joy to me is that whenever I go to comedy clubs, people always say how nice my crowds are. That they're nice and generous. I hear that all the time. Everywhere. Like they were so nice. They tip, they try it, they know how to drink, they fucking keep it down and an amateurs. No. Um, so, but like you say, this show that we're going to do Thursday night, if we're going to do it in Boston, I would go on first, it would be like the, the Joe Rogan show and I'd go out and I bring all these different people up and then at the end he'd do like 15 minutes, 20 minutes, whatever it is and close it out.

Speaker 9:          01:00:14       So that's what the guys would do. They would do a little bit in the beginning and then they would fuck around in between each act. They would fuck around and do that Thursday, no way to do it.

Speaker 3:          01:00:25       And does that take the steam away from being a headliner men? I think it goes a little bit, yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:00:30       Awesome. I think it takes the steam away from a set cause I want to see someone, when I see a guy, when it gets a Stan hope or David towel or something like that, I want to see a 45 minutes set. Plus, I want to say like an hour or something like that. Because when you, when you see like a 45 minute set or an hour set, then you see a real set. Yeah. You see the, you get to fully sink in the experience of them shifting subjects and building momentum and changing gears. And it's all this one thing. You know, it's, it's like seeing an Avatar in two chunks, you know? It's like, you know what I mean? Like you wouldn't want to do that. You'd want, it's a great movie, but you'd want to watch the whole thing. It'd be just as good if it, I mean, you probably enjoy it still if somebody, you know, put an Adam Sandler movie on for 20 minutes in the middle of Avatar, but it wouldn't be the same. I'm not ever calling my act Avatar, but you know, it's a, I think anything you do where you're, you're fully, wholly concentrated on that moment, you know, I think it would make it better. Sure. So I don't, I don't like doing it. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:01:25       No thank you. Find that's the key. Like, I mean, I, I, we always talk about this, that how some comedians become so well loved and so successful. Like Larry the cable guy, I love shitting Dick Jokes. All right? I'm not above any of that, but I think his fans and people that love him just want to hang out with that guy. Right? Like it's friendly and it's, yeah. It's like you want to be around that guy for 45 minutes in here and be in his world. It's not necessarily who's the best craftsmen of the wording of the joke. It's your essence. It's, you know, that's totally true. He was a human being, right?

Speaker 9:          01:01:59       Yeah. And I've heard people say that he's racist and I've heard people say, well, he has some jokes, racial jokes, but what the fuck you, you know, this is the real issue. The real issue is why we live in a world that everyone's so goddamn fucking sensitive. You still a joke about everything and anything, you know, especially these radical Muslim fucks. These guys have really got everybody a corner because he can't even draw Muhammad. You draw Mohammad, they want to stab you. Like really dude going to draw your guy and he can't even draw and what have you drawn real good like this is, you know, it's like Leonardo Davinci wants to draw Muhammad, he can't, you got to shoot him. Come on Bro. That's ridiculous. You guys are being ridiculous. You should be able to tell when you cut humor out of the equation, when you're your society's humorless, when there's things that are off off subject you, you cut out all lines of inquiry, you cut out like real observing, you cut you, and then you force everybody to sort of subscribe to a predetermined pattern of behavior that's politically correct because unless you can tell jokes about shit, then I don't know.

Speaker 9:          01:02:59       I mean you might tell a joke about something that's absolutely horrible and it's not funny at all. But in trying, you test the waters and you know, sometimes there's some poor posture shit going on and if you say people can't joke about it and then one guy does joke about it and fucking knocks it out of the park and everybody's Howlin guess what? That guy had joked about. It's got to a point and you might not want to deal with that point because you're living in a fucking fantasy world where you want everybody to not talk about your particular subject, you know, whatever the fuck it is, what it, whatever it is, whatever taboo you got going on inside your head, whether it's religion or sexual or whatever, whether it's, you know, saying certain words or whether it's, you know, saying you don't believe in God whenever the fuck it is.

Speaker 9:          01:03:40       If you say that someone can't draw Muhammad and someone can't make a south park, they couldn't even make a cartoon where they pretended they were going to draw Mohammed. I mean, what was the full extent hummus? Hamad was actually on South Park. He was the early days early for this. Right. And then the second one, he was at black bar. Then they stopped him from, they stop them from putting Muhammad on again. Right, right. And they made them do it at like he, Mohammed was a teddy bear. All right. Yeah, he was a, he was a weird look and tell him. Yeah. Yeah. I can't remember. But it was some ridiculous shit where they were when they were being threatened where they like, you know those guys? Yeah. But I don't remember that. That was a while ago. They were being threatened and I know that one people have been killed for it and it was at one woman that had to change her identity because she tried to make a certain day draw Mohammed Day.

Speaker 9:          01:04:25       Yeah. You know, and she kind of went on and went deep with it and thought she was being cute and they're like, bitch will cut your fucking head off. You know, you want to play cute. My appeal to my radical Muslim friends please. The Path that you're taking me cutting people's heads off for drawing your guy is not that good one. Okay. You don't need to concentrate on such silly things. This is a crazy way of doing it of course. But the problem is man, that part of the world has a lot of shit and it's in, it's in an environment that has been there for 10,000 years and it's very difficult to change things. The best way to change things like the way America change things by moving move. Everybody moved here a few hundred years ago from somewhere else, and then this was the, the the next stage of change. Right. But if you go, you know, if you live in a place where there's not that much physical change in, you know, and over the hundreds of hundreds of years, it's

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       the Middle Ages there. I was there in July and it's literally just like shitty brick walls and just like mud huts and then the woman in the Burka, and if your husband really loves you, he builds a wall around your backyard so the wife doesn't have to wear a burka while she's doing chores in the backdrop. It's like it's the year 1300 they're very, yeah, he said they catch a man fucking boys. That's right. Yeah, that's what they say. That's the room. The oil rig, the oil rig. Oh yeah, man. I did a show in between Iran and Iraq on an oil rig oil platform. It was a mile long, half, half Iraqi soldiers and half US marines and the marines were teaching the Iraqis to guard their oil. And uh, so I was sleeping on this tanker and it smelled of gasoline all night and you would see the spot while they stink too. Yeah. But uh, you would see spy ships roll up anyway, I got to tour the Iraqi metrics. Yeah. They try to black like Iran would pull up their tank and they would have the word Iran on the side of the boat, but then they would like black it out. Like with black paint.

Speaker 8:          01:06:33       We are not deer run. I pictures, I will show you the pictures pull up to this shit and we sold it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:06:42       So they're spying on us. Training the Iraqis and I got to tour the Iraqi barracks and uh, it's first of all, I mean it's just, it's completely, look, we're, we're really great at being military. The Americans have that shit down. Like the Marine Corps is, we're fucking real. And they're back throw just wires, loose water bottles loose. They would take shits in over the hang their ass over the oil platform, take a shit in the water and then fish in the water, they just shit in and then eat the fish and they a lot of water,

Speaker 8:          01:07:17       I dunno man. And as a seasoning, those guys eat it would probably taste pretty good, but it's not bright to, to, to fish where you don't think they can shit that much to have shooting a sudden they shit around. Really thinking what else? Well, here's another thing. Oh there's probably how many guys were on the $50 hundred dollars? No more than 500. [inaudible] here's the thing too is like, if like if you're, if you shit, where'd you shit last night. Oh, right here. A spot. Don't fish there. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:08:04       So I went to lick their there, the rent and they had mattresses that were folded dirty, dirty mattresses up against like this wall. And I was like, what are the mattresses? Four? And uh, the guy was like, well, it's a thing called man love Thursdays because Thursday is there Friday. I forget what it is. And, and he's, they say, what did they put the mattresses down? And then the guys, they fuck each other on the mattresses. And I know, I mean, who knows if that's just like a speaking douche bags, I don't know. But he also said that he broke up fights where one guy, like I'm saying like Americans being like in the Rockies are a bunch of homos. Yeah. And then, but then I had a commander telling me a story where he had an Iraqi soldier like pound on his door at two in the morning and the guy had bite marks in the back and on his back and he was bleeding from these bite marks.

Speaker 3:          01:08:55       And finally the commander to do that. He thinks some guy was trying to fuck him and he, you know, wasn't allowing and the guy bit his back. So you know, the homosexuality from my understanding is that it's situational. Homosexuality were like, because they can't date women and you, you have to just get married that, you know, they choose men because of the situation they're in. And it's not gay, it's not considered gay. It's just like, okay, it's totally swollen. They don't consider themselves gay. They can just consider themselves really into fucking, yeah, you're just just whatever. Yeah, whatever happened. Those who don't want it well, yeah. In places like Saudi in there too, they, yeah, I'm pretty sure it's prevalent. It's a really, it is and it's so foreign and as a, as a Westerner and you really, I try to be open minded and wrap my head around their culture and there are certain ways they treat women that I'm just like, Yo, I'm not really sure is

Speaker 9:          01:10:01       that as far as we know, and we'll, you know, there's a lot of debate about when the beginning of civilization was, but as far as we can tell it was there as far as we can tell. There was in Iraq, Sumeria. Mesopotamia. Yeah, and that's where the first written language first mathematics are attributed to these guys. They're the first, any, any knowledge whatsoever. It was strongly or astrology. They had the constellations mapped out. They had a different astrological signs. They had 13 I believe instead of the 12 is that correct? I think that's something like that. Anyway, I don't remember how many they are, but what the point was with these people like had this really amazingly advanced civilization 10,000 years ago and today it's, you know, it's more advanced than it was then, but they still have like a really like suppressive ancient style culture. And it's like you really kind of weird to see this combination of like modern technology, extreme a wealth in places like Dubai and the United Arab Emirates and extreme wealth, but also this like weird, you know, with the modern stuff and this weird ancient stuff. Know like the whole thing about, you know, um, the, just the laws of Islam, the women wearing and all of that, that, that crazy. I mean, when did that start?

Speaker 3:          01:11:16       Well, it's a theocracy. You have to understand that even in the Gulf countries that are more progressive, like, um, you know, the United Arab Emirates, where'd you buy is like, there's places you can drink a beer for ex pats, not the Muslims because they don't drink. Yeah. But I mean, you'll be in a Mcdonald's and you'll hear a call to prayer and the expectation is that you got to put down your mcrae. Really? I'm dropping. Rolling. Yeah. Like you gotta get down. Who Calls to prayer? Um, no, at the mosques, like you hear a five times a day. Like the first time I heard it, I didn't even know what that sound was. It sounds, it's like terrifying. It's like, ah, and you're like, what the fuck is happening?

Speaker 9:          01:11:51       So you could think of, it's like the end of [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          01:11:52       Yeah, you don't. And as it, you're like, it sounds like you just want to cover your ears and just cry. And that's their, that's their call to prayer. So you just don't know what the fuck's happened.

Speaker 9:          01:12:02       Do you, you know, the, a lot of people saying that there's something to having some sort of an extreme discipline along those lines, that it does keep you billing line and facilitates family and it facilitates, it's possible. It doesn't always, obviously if they're fucking little kids in the ass.

Speaker 11:         01:12:17       Yeah. I don't know. Right now people are that everybody across the

Speaker 9:          01:12:21       board. But the idea that, uh, you know, some intense form of study, like, like Islam or like Buddhism or Christianity or like anything where you're really getting involved in the, you know, the practice of some intense discipline and some intense study of, especially if you have strict enforcement. Yeah. That's that, that's the key right there, man. When you have like a, you know, in Iran where they have the religious police and in addition to, or if you go to Saudi Arabia, they have that they have like religious police. Yeah. We had somebody who was the old Soviet Union was going to get arrested.

Speaker 3:          01:12:56       Oh, I almost, and Ramadan, I was there during their, their holy month of Ramadan. I was in the back of a van drinking a bottle of water and the marine I was worth, it was like, what the fuck and model out we're on the freeway. If someone sees you on the freeway drinking water when the sun is still up during Ramadan, the religious, they can report you to the religious police. And as a Westerner, they'll throw you in jail. And that's in the hip city of Dubai.

Speaker 11:         01:13:20       Oh yes,

Speaker 3:          01:13:21       and you get sent to jail for like two months and it's like a $3,000 penalty and they all feed you. They don't feed you, so your relatives have to come and feed you if you have the misfortune of getting put into jail in the Middle East. So I don't know why they don't eat and I don't know why they're plugging Dubai. Is this like wild west? This like Vegas of the Middle East? It's, it's still Muslim. You guys like it's not it. It enraged me to see sex in the city, to taking place in like Abu Dhabi. Like are you kidding me? Like this is not a place for you

Speaker 11:         01:13:53       slut. Yeah. Dot. Don't old sled and really confused thinking that sluttiness was acceptable and not sad. Oh, that woman's not sad. She's all fucking panther. She's out there having a good time. She's hot. You go girl.

Speaker 2:          01:14:11       And all these women with broken vaginas lined up to see this fucking crap. You get them off the sloppy Ted's just like Clint Eastwood had people thinking they can keep an orangutan as a pet. Right? You can't fucking do that, man. I think I'll rip your arms off. Stuffed them up your nose. Did you hear about that guy with the hippo? You didn't hear about this guy. I saw something. It was a guy's famous on the Internet for having a pet hippo that he rides. It actually rides this hippo. He found it when it was a cub raised it, it's whole light waves that well, it finally fucking chilled them. This poor fucking silly cunt was killed by the animal. Shocker. That kills more people in Africa than any animal to be fucking oh yeah, dude. Yeah. Tigers are actually in Asia, but um, they, they, they bite people in fucking half, man.

Speaker 2:          01:15:06       They're, they're actually like a tight, well, I think there's somehow or another like cousins to a pig. Uh, they used to think they were like really closely related, but another thing, there's some just shoot and they're like, but whatever it is, they're all this fuck. Well, they are as a giant fucking animal that is super aggressive and really mean and just bit the fuck out of this guy. And they found this corpse mauled in the water. Well, he thought it was cute that he used to ride this thing. You can't grow up with an animal from like from an early age that and it would not fall in love with you that it would still do this. It's got a weird still in some ways I think people get aggressive with people and they hit people, you know, like brothers and sisters hit each other and they don't have enough strength to hurt each other, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:15:49       But if your brother was a fucking gorilla, an 800 pound gorilla and you were a two month old baby and your brother got mad at you and just fucking club do you in the head and he would kill you. The problem is, you know when, when babies get managed or they're, well, they're both babies and they really don't have much impact to their slaps. This is a completely different thing. That's Hipaa. This hippo got mad like for a moment, this guy's probably an annoying douche bag. Why is he riding his hipbone the first place, right? They're fed him. This guy's fucking crazy. He's a crazy person. This is not what you're supposed to do. What's everybody knows that you're not supposed to fucking even make contact with these. There's this guy bald, by the way, he's a big guy. What city was it was a marble. I think there's a South Africa. Um, yeah. Why do people need exotic pets? Why? Why must you see that? You saw that you guys saw the guy in Ohio, right? Yeah. Yeah. The crazy guy who had all those animals who killed himself. Let all the animals free kill themselves. At least that guy had them in cages, you know, and that guy, they knew it was a fucking, uh, who is a loose cannon. They said that he had threatened to do that before they had an issue with the cops. It's like all like these fucking animals.

Speaker 2:          01:16:57       It's crazy asshole. When I was going to say that was the district of upon us might not even want it to kill him. He might have gotten mad at him. Like he would bite another hippopotamus, like, get off me bitch. Stop writing me. I want to fucking rest. But when you do that too, a little flimsy ass person, they break and they die. There's a video that Brian turned me onto of lions trying to kill a hippo and it's the craziest thing ever. They can't kill it. The jump on his thing bite then it's kind of fucked up in the hip. I was just like getting mad, like, get off me bitch. But they keep buying them and keep them. They can't kill it. He's like armored and what they're doing is biting through his spine slowly. That's how they're killing them. They're choosing to pick a spot on a spine and they're pulling chunks of it out and he's like barely noticing that they're there. That's not an animal you want to fuck where no fuck worth. As human beings, we're actually quite vulnerable in the wild, like the our only protection is our brains.

Speaker 2:          01:17:53       We don't have an exoskeleton or I always say, think about a fucking house, cat house Canada. If a house cat wants to kill you, could you imagine? Could you imagine what that's like? Have you ever been around a feral cat wildcat there? Scariest fucking, they're scary. They're really terrifying. I've been over around feral cats that I thought were going to attack me. And it is a dangerous moment like where you like this thing can do some fucking damage. It can jump all the way up to your face easily. A cat can easily jump right up to your face and bite your fucking face. You imagine a wild cat claws. Dig It into your head. Won't let go biting your face and kicking with his back leg. That's absolutely frightening. And they're tiny. They're tiny. You saw my little cat let us pass. And what does she wish she said were like three pounds or something. But if she wanted to fuck me up, that'd be terrifying. In Ball. Scary.

Speaker 5:          01:18:40       I lived in Boston for a summer one time and uh, my, I was staying with my friend on a first floor apartment and they, I slept on the couch and the couch was right next to the first floor windows and they would open the window and it had a screen and there was a neighborhood Ferrell, crazy maniac, fucking like emotionally unadjusted cat

Speaker 2:          01:19:01       when I'm chilling, just laying there. It would jump up onto the screen and go, like, I wouldn't show up, I would levitate, like jump up off the thing and it would just sit there and scream closet crazy. Looking at PSI, I would have fucking near harder about that. Toxo plasma, that parasite that a lot of feral cats have in there. No, it's a, it's a rat parasite. It starts out in rats and it hijacks a rat sexual reward system and gets these rats attracted to the smell of cat piss. So like the rats go around the cats, the cats eat the rats, the cats get it. And then the cats give it to people usually from feces, from stepping in their shit or dropping your food in there and you pick it up. Yeah. And it affects human, uh, the human brain. It affects the way people behave and makes men more impulsive. It's a responsible for a disproportionate number of motorcycle accidents. They checked people that are crashing motorcycles and they find out that a lot of them are infected with this toxoplasma shit. And in Europe it's like really prevalent anywhere.

Speaker 9:          01:20:08       There's a lot of wild cats. It's really prevalent like a Europe and France, 80% of the people are in fact, it would toxoplasma, yes, 80 in America, it's over 60 million. It's really crazy. But that cat might've had that and it might've been just, I'm not, I can't even describe to how terrifying it was. I don't think they hear a mapped out the behavior, the behavioral change that had, hasn't cats because I've only heard about the behavioral change in humans and rats. So just really interesting that I, I've never heard anything. There's a guy named Robert Sapolsky, this the, a the leading scientist on all this shit and he's got some amazing videos on it and you know, he goes into depth about how, uh, they, they really are just sort of wrapping their head around this, the, uh, the extent of the infiltration of this parasite into the, into human beings.

Speaker 9:          01:20:52       I mean, it's like, it might be like half the population of the earth are fact. It's really crazy. Yeah. I mean, because in Brazil it's 60% and France, it's 80%. It's, it's like it's really high and a lot of different places in South America. It's, it's like I said, over 60 million. That's the, the estimate. People don't even know, you know, mean we always talk about it. Like we, you know what if I had it, I was around a cat when I was young. I had a feral cat that I raised, you know, and uh, Brian's been around cats, Kansas whole live. Joey Diaz has like 11 cats. What would you tell him? He has 11 cats and a lot of them were wild. He's to take wild cats in and feed wild cats outside. Wait, what could that do to you though? We don't know. Fucks with your brain, man. Yeah. You know, your immune system is supposed to keep most of it in check and if you have a healthy immune system, but they, they don't know really. They don't, I mean, it affects people in different ways. Could you imagine everybody's just racing that, hang around with cats.

Speaker 8:          01:21:44       That's just gave me a huge, huge ruthless dick. Imagine if like, it wasn't Viagara that you needed, it was just, you gotta be around a lot of cat shit. Joey's got a Bagel. This is, this is what happens, bro. Here's, here's the good news. Here's the bad news. The good news is meant to Dick bigger and stronger.

Speaker 9:          01:22:00       Okay. What's the bad news? The bad news is you become a crazy person. Yes.

Speaker 8:          01:22:05       Eating itself. Your brain is like, in fact, when the cat parasite, I heard a lot of people say this cat person I saw that about if the positive was a dick got bigger and was hard at will. If your Dick was like a Rhino Horn, they can always call upon the, uh, that hippo story made me reminded me of that asshole with the bears, grizzly man, crazy theater. And we laughed so hard. That kind of cemented our relationship. There was a moment and we watched, we watched that documentary in the theater and there's probably, there's 40 or 50 people there and we kept, we were the assholes. They were likely to have fucking done like the whole time. And then there was a scene, well, I'll never forget where they interviewed a pilot that would fly Timothy out there and uh, and the place is quiet and we're sitting there watching and then they go, what did you think when you like would drop them off? And he told you he was going to be with bears for months and the guy goes, well, honestly I thought he was retarded

Speaker 11:         01:23:09       and we laughed so loud and everybody in the theater and when we look at where did you guys see it? We saw it in some dilemma. I saw that in Hollywood and the whole theater was laughing. I saw it in a gray zone. Everybody thought it was funny. Yeah. I think you started with Eddie.

Speaker 8:          01:23:28       We were blazed. Of course. Every moment of the movie was Hilarious,

Speaker 11:         01:23:32       man. We were laughing. It was like a God damn comedy when he was playing with the shit out. He's like, no dude, it's stuck up there. Shit. We were laughing

Speaker 8:          01:23:47       so hard and that's, that place felt like it was a dean of stuffy. I think Lemley crowd generally I need to move to Pasadena. Yeah. Because the ice house get myself a mansion up there. Shit. Yeah. Dean is where it's at. I liked it. It's what the San Fernando Valley intended to be. I grew up in the valley. Yeah, but they wanted it to be like Pasadena. Pasadena is better. Some hearts are got in the valley, but summer, whenever we do the ice house, they were like, people are fucking really genuinely nice out here. It doesn't feel like La. It feels like a different type of homeless people are all old ladies too. There was no like homeless guys are old ladies and they make these like tent, like these, these forts and they're so nicely folded like blankets and cans are folded. Even sad shit dude. It's really makes me feel really bad when I see some woman and you know, I see her out there on her own. I don't know why it kills me. I don't like those. It makes me, I feel like some old guy like to carry, so still

Speaker 11:         01:24:42       I see an older, I see an old, a woman

Speaker 8:          01:24:45       and I feel terrible. I don't you hate seeing old, like I'm talking to older people doing like, like having like judge your garbage. Like can you see like, uh, like a seven, uh, clearly somebody in their seventies, like just having any job really. I feel like sometimes they like that though. Like my mom retired and then went back to work at a fucking Amish restaurant gift shop just because she was bored out of her mind. That's different. He's like getting excited an hour. You can see it on someone's face. You can see when they're like, ah, I gotta do this to get the, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That sucks. Well, you know, it sucks because you also imagine yourself doing that. Of course, when you're tired and old and yeah, you really should be resting and enjoying your last days on this planet, but for your fucking transitioned into the afterlife. But now you've got to fucking hat on. You're working at Chuckie cheese, you know, hey kids, what do you want? You want a special and you want pizza? Do you want to try it? That's why they be done daily. Double Dose.

Speaker 8:          01:25:40       This, my parents generation cause they really got fucked in this recession. A lot of people that are planning on retiring can't do that now. You worked their whole God damn life and now what? Yeah, there's a guy who lives down the street from me that was trying to build a house. He had this whole speech, he had a plot, picked out a really nice spot with a beautiful view and everything and he was putting all his money towards this and fucking stock market crashed and all the, all the bullshit went down the economy, shit, the bed, he, he lost his, he lost his savings. He lost everything. He lost the whole pile. Just has this lot is beautiful lot that represents is his dreams that will never take place and he's an older guy man. He's so, he's not going to be around that much longer.

Speaker 8:          01:26:24       That really tells me there are people that retired at exactly the right moment. You know what I mean? Like there are people who got their money out when it was at a peak and then there was people who like were like literally the, it's like a like a cliche like buddy cop movie. Like I'm retiring next year and you're like that guy just from sticking around like till may or whatever. It was like lost his net worth 50 60 completely changed his fucking life. Yeah, that crazy low. A lot of people planned on, everything's staying the same. They're like, we just got it. We're just about to escape here and boom, the floor falls out and not only are you out of a job, not only do you no longer have a pension, but oh, guess what? You can afford your house anymore. Oh, well you were almost homeless.

Speaker 8:          01:27:12       Oh, look at this. Now you're sleeping at your friend's house. Like Holy Shit. You have your kids and your wife and your, you're staying at someone else's house and you were in their basement all huddle up together and you're like, holy fuck, I can't find a job. Boom. That's what's happening to a lot of people map. There's a, there's a lot of people out there that it just stopped, like the, the, the machine stopped and everybody was like, what's going on? Where are the jobs? There are no jobs. There's no jobs in Ohio. I mean there's a few clubs in Ohio, like Toledo and Cleveland. Yeah. It's so sad because there's nothing for people to do Detroit. You got to see it like, oh no one talks about it. But like, I did Detroit twice this year and like, uh, you know, there's, there's, uh, the club isn't actually improper Detroit, but you, you know, you fly in then harbor that club.

Speaker 8:          01:27:57       No, I did. Um, I did the comedy castle, which is a suburb of it or something. But you drive through and like the, you know, the fucked up part is, um, it's actually, I think seeing the industry places that have closed that used to be this factory and then all the windows are broken out. You're like, Holy Shit, that's a place that like 2000 people or whatever you used to work at and it's just gone. You ever seen those videos where they drive down hole? Huge. Just mile after mile of abandoned houses. Yeah, it's like craziness. And so it really does look like some Mad Max Shit, you know? It looks like, like what? What comes next? You know, what is this like? This is a large scale. It's Goddamn Detroit, Detroit rock city. It's where mustangs come from. It's, we're Corvettes come from sort of the Bowling Green Kentucky now. But you know what I'm saying? It's like that's where, you know, cars, American cars were built, really moved to Canada. That was his first job at Chrysler factory. It's, I don't know if is there anymore? I don't know. Probably in Mongolia. I just heard this guy on NPR, he wrote a book about

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       how this generation of kids, you know, your Momma always told you, be a doctor, be a lawyer, being accounting. Because those jobs you'll all, you always have a job. Well not now because you can outsource that. You want your taxes done cheap, you can send them to a guy in India that can, that knows tax law. Same with everything else. So this generation, they're going to have to get creative in terms of like how they think, create their own jobs, create their own way of making money. Like those those days are slowly dwindling down those, those trade. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:29:30       Yeah. We'll also, when you have the Internet and you're sending files, it doesn't matter if you send a file to the account accountant up the street or if you send the file to a guy on the other side of the world. Oh yeah. If he's willing to do it cheaper. Yeah. It's if our fucking very strange time and mechanics good. The real problem is right now we are slowly being forced to live. The reality to the rest of the world has been operating under for the past few decades. That's really what's going on, you know? And everybody was like, you know, America is not a third world country, you know? Yeah. Well when everything becomes the same, guess what? Yeah. A lot of it is going to be like a third world country because as we more interconnect with the rest of the world, you know, and as our facade of an economy slowly evaporates into nothing. This, yeah, we were really are forced into a situation that looks eerily similar to what Russia faced. It was really, yeah. It looks like you're really getting better,

Speaker 5:          01:30:22       uh, at, at many things in different, you know, fields. Yeah. I didn't, I saw a thing about um, highways and freeways and how like for a long time, like we set the standard for light. Like we were the first like massive country to build like where you can you think about it. We don't, we take it for granted that you can get in a car and be like, I want to drive to Montana. You just, any, any other city you want, you want to go to Louisiana, you just take this way. You know, it just, it's like that and we've had like the best and like China is killing us in highways and freeways in quality in like uh, the number of them and then where you can go in them killing us.

Speaker 9:          01:30:58       Ordained says they kill us. The cell phone coverage. He's like, you're going over there. Oh yeah. He said he can be over there and like the middle of nowhere in the woods and you got five bars. Goddamn. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:31:07       Well I haven't been to China, but I've been to South Korea and dude, their society is way more advanced. They feel like

Speaker 9:          01:31:14       their internet is way more advanced. Every new phones are more advanced, cleaner. They're just have, I don't know, they're way ahead of us. They're crushing it by a lot of shit with their phones, but they're just, that's just starting to come to the phones now. There's a thing called Google Wallet. Google wallet is an APP that allows you to go up to a, when you go to the thing where you scan your credit card, you could look at it and if it has like sort of this logo on it, this Google wallet, sort of a logo. Then what you do is you take the application, you pull it up on your Google phones, press it said put it right up to that and it automatically pays for your, your bill. So you don't even have to swipe a credit card. You don't have to sign shit.

Speaker 9:          01:31:52       He just put in your code, put it, press your phone right up to it, Bang. So you don't have to have a phone. I mean you don't have to have a wallet with credit cards anymore. Eventually. Yeah. Eventually everything you'll be able to buy with your phone. I don't know if Google Wallet exists. Do you know Brian with a Google wallet exist for the Iphone? I don't think so. No. I think it just takes you to, I think you'd do it over a website though. Oh, over website. I don't know. No, that's whack. You want to do it. That's one. One knock the Google phones have over the iPhone if they have that because that's pretty dope. Once it comes into focus, once it becomes a really popular thing that might make people shy away from the iPhone to the droid phones

Speaker 12:         01:32:28       getting the new studio. One thing I thought was really interesting was that like home speeds for internet or capped at around what's the highest lately? Like 60 or is it even at 30 megabytes? I only get, I don't, I only get like 25 of 25 but uh, what I have to get a business account because it's a business space that I rent. The internet speeds are like up to like hundreds of gigabytes or even more. Maybe like the upload speeds are ridiculous too. I think there were like five megabyte uploads and stiff what? I think I'm paying for two megabyte for the fastest for a universe and it's like that's not even fair. It's like I almost like if I am at home and I went to play games or ba be able to pay for something like this. I wish I would have to make my house a business almost or something. I think you could probably do that if you can make your house a business. No, I mean just like listed as a business.

Speaker 9:          01:33:20       You would have to like not live there though. I mean I don't think it works out what you can, I don't know if it's the same. Like if you have a Home Office, I think that's still a home. Right. I don't know though. I mean you're building might've been wired differently too though. You have to take that into account. It's a building, you know that's a commercial building. I mean when they wired it they might've Wa I don't know what the story is. What is keeping you from getting the highest internet? You know

Speaker 12:         01:33:43       that's weird though. It's, it's, it's, it's weird that like, cause I live very close to it, you know, and I've, I checked it. I wonder if it's something like they can't offer it to that, that many people like the bandwidth isn't there. Yeah, that's a good point. I mean that could be, yeah, because people will be just downloaded a million movies all day. It, has anybody ever gone to jail for stealing movies? Yeah. What's that one movie? The one the boring ass. Maybe we were there like picking up bombs, whatever that movie was at won all those awards where it's like there's that hurt locker, the hurt locker there. Those guys like I guess when after like tons of people, like 25,000 people or something ridiculous like that and they just dropped a lot of them the other day, so they're still getting suing people that downloaded their movie. I'll leave that. It's weird at the production company actually is the one going after them. So the production company,

Speaker 9:          01:34:34       they somehow or another find out who is put these things on long and for download and then they, they attract, they attack them.

Speaker 12:         01:34:40       Yeah. They pretty much tell like, you know, certain cases. Could they tell by who uploaded it? Is that what it is? I guess, you know what they do is they can check the, the ips get from the torrents and stuff like that. And then they would have to sue like know charter or whoever. They made an out of some kid a couple of years ago, wasn't it like a kid and his mom and they were like me, even though everybody had downloaded songs, they went after some kid and they were like, you owe like $380,000 because this amount per song. Yeah. But then they, you know, I think they settled with the medical work, but it was, they were doing that clearly just to get publicity for the case and make it seem like, you know, don't you dare dream of doing this.

Speaker 9:          01:35:19       It is kind of weird, man. It's such a weird gray area. Whether or not something that you bought and you paid for, whether you could

Speaker 12:         01:35:26       distributed for music. It's really interesting like how these paid, uh, the companies like Spotify and rhapsody and stuff like that really in my opinion, have stepped in. And I don't really download music much anymore because now I just pay 10 bucks a month for Spotify and I fucking listen to it as much as I want to. You know, it's like a jukebox of everything. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:35:46       Does don't you have to be online to get that?

Speaker 12:         01:35:48       Uh, not all the time. I think you can save songs to your device. I haven't really fucked around with it too much on that part, but uh, I think you could also save songs. Like I said, if you pay $10 a day, it will download it inside the app and then it will off. It needs to at least connect to make sure that you're a member still and then it makes the, all the songs were,

Speaker 9:          01:36:05       that's annoying. That's too complicated. I'd rather get things on iTunes. I get my shit on it. How do you feel about

Speaker 12:         01:36:10       like your content though?

Speaker 9:          01:36:13       You know what, man, I think you know what I do is very different because first of all, as a comedian, when you're, you know, when you're releasing your information or when you're releasing your material, rather if you like putting on a CD or a DVD or something, you're essentially putting out an advertisement and you're essentially putting out a, uh, uh, an example of your work that you're proud of, that you want people to see and enjoy, you know? And Yeah, you want to be compensated for it. Yeah. You want to make money for it. But the way I roll is it, if I download, if I've ever downloaded anything illegally, I've always bought it if I liked it. Always really was. Yeah. Well, and even bought, I've bought some things that I didn't like just because I felt guilty because I couldn't, couldn't get it legally when I wanted to, so I had to get it some other way.

Speaker 9:          01:36:56       There's no way. Most people do that though. Yeah. I have a problem. I can't litter if I drop something on the ground is I have to get it. You know? I'll often after, if the fucking wind is blowing, goddammit, off the fucking chase after this little piece of paper, it could be a gum wrapper. Really? Yeah. I don't like, it's nice. I don't like leaving behind a problem. It bugs me, you know? So when I look at the idea of littering psychically, the idea of littering with your consciousness that you, you, you take little thing, you do shitty little things and you take them for granted and then you have these little things curled up in a fucking corner. There's a little crumpled up papers of, of ideas and consciousness is littered your fucking head. I don't like it. So if I, if a band is good, if I buy, you know, if somebody sends me to a youtube link and I go, wow, that's fucking badass song. And then there's a download link somewhere on some site where you're not supposed to go to. And I download it and I like it. I always buy it. That's great. I think you have to, I think you're supposed to. I don't really download anything, any,

Speaker 12:         01:37:52       I mean everything I know. Itunes, I mean, even then, I mean like say if I found something illegal, I'll search to find it illegally or buy it on Amazon, you know? Yeah. You guys touching each other? It was accidental that I bumped it. Sorry if you heard about Gene Simmons, Simmons Kid, uh, what happened there was news. Uh, I read this morning one of the beer. Yeah, sure. He's a comic book artist and Nicole One, you want a cold? Oh Shit. Given another. The WHO? Who's this? Uh, Gene Simmons is kid. Yeah. And he does comic books. He does a Manga, I think it's called a Japan Japanese style Nma and thanks man. Yeah, it's real nice guy. I actually met him once I at the Improv, but there's this, uh, they, they outdid him for just completely tracing a Japanese comic book artists and like they have these like lineups where they showed like face on top of phase where they overlay it and it's exactly him.

Speaker 12:         01:39:01       How old is he? 19 or 20 isn't he? He's young. I don't know if he's 19 or 20, but I don't know the whole story. I don't know if like the comics, like an old comic, because I know I used to draw comics just for fun. I know that there has been many times where I'd like, I liked like how Spiderman was posing or something like that. So I would like trace his pose. You know, you learn how to draw. So I'm wondering is see an art student or is he trying to sell these things? That's where it makes me think he sells them. I think he's pretty successful. Kind of hard to get away from that one. Like a trace the ship. So the Japanese artists on his Twitter today, uh, you know, was confused at first, but then he said something like, I'm more surprised that Gene Simmons says kid does comics or something like that. I can't remember. But he knows about it. He didn't seem that angry. Wow. How did it not seem angry though? I don't know. You know, very polite Japanese people. I have no idea. I always feel about stealing now is that like, especially with jokes, it's like, well I can always write another one. It sucks to have your shit. Yeah. I could see it happening more in comic books just for people that like, I guess he took a lot though that the comic was called bleach

Speaker 9:          01:40:10       a band for a little while. What does he, yeah, yeah, I remember he on, I watched the show and the on the reality show, his band was playing somewhere and then his father like flew a flyer out of a plane I was showing it was son's bands playing somewhere and you know, making a big deal out of it. Wow. This is crazy. Wow.

Speaker 12:         01:40:30       You seeing that? It's the kid that's on that show. Yeah. Side by side. Not Analysis

Speaker 9:          01:40:35       is pretty fucking damning. Yeah. He's old enough to know what I mean. It is. He, he's, yeah, it's this is, it's not just tracing it. I mean it's like a straight up taking almost. Some of it is not tracing some of it. This one's not tracing, but it's very obvious where the idea came from. Yeah. This is bad.

Speaker 8:          01:40:54       So sad. Yeah. Hmm. I miss the Osborne through all your own stuff. Everybody. It's weird. I love that show. Well, some of them were a bit of a stretch. This is a few of them here that are a bit of a stretch because that is a style. What did you look up? How do you look it up? I just Google uh, Gene Simmons kid comic book. Okay. Trace. Well it definitely looks like pop up. What day? There's no doubt about the idea that he was influenced, you know, he's an unquestionably, he was influenced but there's a bunch of these pictures that are real stretch. Did you see what that guy on your message board said that he, he uh, for a living buys Google ads all the time. And we always joke about like how I always put bottle at the end of Google searches. So he was making it targeting California for the words, but hole on the end of any kind of sentence and it just says something like, hey ride man.

Speaker 8:          01:41:47       Stop saying buy it whole or look searching for [inaudible] as a Google ads. Google took it down because they get, he used the word butthole chance. Say butthole for Google for ads. You could sell them missiles. Yeah. This, yeah. This is, this is crazy, man. This is weird to watch. He really did trace this stuff. Yeah. Yeah, you can. I mean, they even show an overlay. They show like, here's the original image. It says, look, trace to throw it. That really sucks. It's fucking sad. This is something that's something that's really hard to recover from. Well as that appears like he's just made a career doing this. Like he's decided to try to, to make a career doing it this way. Tracy. All right. Yeah. It looks like you're gonna have to borrow some more money from dad for awhile. Well, I don't know man. You know, you want to give people the benefit of the doubt.

Speaker 8:          01:42:41       Who knows? It seems, it seems pretty shitty though. Sucks. It sucks the air. Right. Maybe he was fucking a guy. Maybe he was just horsing around. You know, he's just doing horseplay while, well, why would people think you're plagiarizing? Don't have to ask them. Don't ask me that. You'd have to ask them. How was your horsing around? Have you heard the new fad, that team, that's the real problem in high schools is that teens are using vodka. So tampons to get drunk at a, no, no, no. This is real. This news stories about it. Go ahead. Look up the new store. Girls are doing this in high school there. They're soaking, they're soaking tampons with vodka and sticking them in their pussy and they're inserting a beer bongs and they're assholes and they're getting drunk.

Speaker 8:          01:43:40       People are nuts. You gotta go for it. Nuts. Apparently. This is what this Vod Cup tampon thing. You got gotta do it because you get the video teen chain using or vodka. So tampons to get drunk. Teens using vodka, soak tampons to get drunk and you're listening. Go for it, man. Try the whole bundle where you can die. This is the problem. It's the alcohol is going right into your bloodstream. It's like shooting ivy blood. You know, you can take things rectally. Like there's this girl, she goes by the name of a neuro soup on, uh, on Youtube and she has like a website called neuro soup I think. And she's like kind of a famous person in the psychedelic community because at one point in time she was living with this guy. There was this gigantic LSD dealer, like the biggest l LSD dealer in the world.

Speaker 8:          01:44:28       And she was a stripper. And this is a really interesting thing on vice.com a video where they interview her and they talk about the crazy times that she's been through. One of the things, one of our videos online is her taking DMT Ainley. She takes DMT and sticks it in her ass and trips for like an hour. Wow. Yeah. Wow. Indeed. That videos. Yeah. She put the video out there. Good old fashion. The old fashion, I guess she wanted to go for a longer ride. The old fashioned way, only lasts for about 15 minutes at the most. What about LSD? You could put that up your ass, but you can see my eyes. Well, Jimi Hendrix, the, the little legend is the, Jimi Hendrix used to put it on his Bandana and as he was sweating and enter into the pores [inaudible] I've heard of it being in socks and the people sweating into their sis like accidentally.

Speaker 8:          01:45:20       I don't know if that's true, but I'm sure it could happen. Yeah, I'm sure that makes sense. Branding out a dead show is always interesting seeing happen with, um, who is the creator of Lsd doctor, the one that was like, God dammit, I can't remember his name and Leery. No, no, no. [inaudible] I don't know. I forget the fucking guys name. God Damn it. But anyway, uh, I believe at first [inaudible] Albert Hoffman, I would often, and then Albert Hoffman when he invented it, I believe it happened by accident. And if I'm not, if I'm not incorrect, I think he got it on his hands or something. I forget how he was initially exposed to it. I forget the story, but, uh, I'm pretty sure it, the first time it was like he got it on something. I was like, what the fuck is going on on acid before?

Speaker 8:          01:46:19       No, I've never done it. I said, I've only done Salvia DMT, Fyedka Tampon. Some of the craziest experience I've ever had. US eating pot, some of the most intense psychedelic experiences I've ever has eating cod. I've told her, I'm sure. Just share some stories. You've heard it all when it comes to what teenagers are turning to, to get that quick. It's, it's pretty scary. Was with Erwin is here with a straight story. Oh boy. Elizabeth, right. One I've got to tell you. See and Catherine, two things I never thought would appear in the same exact tampons and vodka. Do I have your attention? Good. Because if you're a parent, you really still are tight.

Speaker 1:          01:47:06       She's went home immediately stuffed the whole bottle of vodka or asshole. Any city, Sally, I doing it right now. Finance will open my asshole

Speaker 8:          01:47:17       when we heard how kids are getting drunk. No Way. So we hit up the experts to find out if it's an urban legend or if it's legit. There's been documented cases of people going to the hospital with alcohol poisoning just from utilizing it that way. Utilizing. Thomas spends his days patrolling the halls of a valley high school. He's heard firsthand how kids are getting tipsy. What we're hearing about is teenagers utilizing a Tampon. So Kumon Bod kippers, right. Teens taking tampons, soaking them in vodka, damn. Teens and inserting them in. They're posted there.

Speaker 1:          01:47:57       She can't even say vagina. She says there. That's a terrified we are. Anything sexual in America,

Speaker 8:          01:48:03       it's unbelievable. Off is definitely not there. No, no, no. They'll insert them into their rectum.

Speaker 1:          01:48:10       Alright. And where she comes out the same. So I'm, I've found the, uh, how acid was invented. Yeah, it was an accident. While it's recent, the sizing LSD Hoffman accidentally absorbed a small amount of it through his fingertips and serendipitously discovered the powerful effects. He said this is his exact words affected by a remarkable, remarkable restlessness combined with a slight dizziness at home. I laid down and sank into a non unpleasant intoxicated like condition characterized by an extremely stimulated imagination in a dream like state with eyes closed, I found the daylight to be unpleasantly glaring. I have received an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense kaleidoscope play of colors. After some two hours in this condition faded away. Wow. So then he decided to take it on his own. So this was by accident. And then what he did is he took it on his own and tried to ride home on his bike. It was a little area called him bicycle day. The Guy gave herself 25 [inaudible] 25 milligrams, which is 250 micrograms. That's how fucking actual threats. Threshold dose is only 20 micrograms. Threshold dose. That means you feel it. You feel it at 20 micrograms. So that's the intoxication threshold is 20 micro grams. He takes two 50 [inaudible]. I've never found it from anybody. I trust I, I got some from this guy that was friends with Andy Dick and he was out of his fucking mind, this guy, and he's like really wanted me to come

Speaker 9:          01:49:48       home and take it again? Nope. Now it's going to ask you about going to happen. It's getting liquid, even getting liquid. You've got to know that you're getting it, man. You've got to know that people are taking it consistently. It's really fucking have it tested. This motherfucker really what it should be. His fucking legal. And there should be LSD like institutes where you go and, Hey, do you want to really know who you are? Sit down. You know what I mean? It's all chemically simple. Are chemically similar to, uh, to each other. Have you all like Dmt, Lsd, mushrooms are all really close to exactly. Dimethyl. Here we go. Sorry, I don't know. I have Google on your phone. I did ask that as a kid in math and he said, here we go. Because there's a video of me talking about at least got going in that, um, and we've talked about it on the podcast a hundred times, right? It's, it's a, it's a psychedelic chemical, but it's one of your own brain. Makes Gotcha. Oh, I'm sorry. And all the really powerful ones like Lsd, Lsd, and DMT and mushrooms, they're all real similar. They're like chemical cousins, you know? So it's, it's interesting that those are the super potent ones and they're really close to what your own brain may

Speaker 8:          01:50:55       naturally LSD. I don't know man, because I've taken that a lot in my brain. Does not function. Did you ever take it through your ass hole? No. I took it out loud. Blues I when I was 14 years old and I was golf and I haven't got a hat on him. Yeah. I had to retain, I had retainers and a velvet dress, shit and Susie and the banshees came on and I did at the same time and I have through my retainers across the field at Irvine Meadows and I had to leave and that was the end of that. Did you ever read about how the a scary CIA, we'd like you to test it. Yes. The young people, short videos, the town in France where they dose the whole town and put it in their bread, killed themselves, but I am the 1950s and really are they doused a whole town. They just experiment. And our town in France. The Americans, yeah. Freedom of Information Act. It's all all available now. There's a lot of cool read

Speaker 9:          01:51:45       be shit they do. They're really truly defines what the government is all about. Yeah. It was, a lot of people think the government is just us working in a different job. It's not, it's the people that have a history of being ruthless, a history of being ruthless. And that's how you get to that position in the first place. But the experiments that they did on, on people are just fucking, yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:52:03       Horrendous. No. What was the utility of LSD initially? It was,

Speaker 9:          01:52:08       they thought was going to be a true CEO, Sarah. Oh, I thought it was to make sure they wanted to use it. Yeah. No, and that's why they didn't do, they give them steroids for that. Oh, okay. Steroids and meth. Crystal Meth is something that the Japanese invented that for getting fucking planes to crash into boats. Gotta be all messed up and do that. And they all met up really well. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's where crystal meth a dream was. It invented and now you can just drive trucks on it. Have you ever been around people that are on meth?

Speaker 8:          01:52:36       Uh, in high school, I grew up here around here actually in your neighborhood. And that was the drug of my generation was meth and then rave culture. So was dropping tons

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       of v and taking meth, cocaine, not so much an LSD that, that's my generation. Once I tried it and I don't, I don't like how like just just do coke. Coke is so much classier. You fucking stay up for days making collages and moving furniture. It's utter chaos because that's how I felt, you know, because you're just so fired up. You're like, oh, I'm gonna do something. But there's nothing, at least for me, I kind of be construct just once, once like it, from what I understand, Adderall cousins as well. Even when I did Adderall, I felt like I was getting drips and like cocaine, whatever it triggered was the same fucking neighborhood as drips come from actually snorting. It felt like it crush it up. And we know a guy who, uh, was, uh, like I, I talk, I tell the story now on stage of, of the guy who used to drive us to the airport.

Speaker 5:          01:54:02       This was our driver, like a regular guy, cause we go to the airport so often we use this, you know, we found a, like a cheaper car service. It's easier than dealing with like driving and parking and like he was uh, you know, like a cheap ride, basically older guy. And I'm like all white hair. It was really professional. And then like, after like 10 rides, one of those things where like, you know, when somebody like Mr Rogan, Mr and you finally go, you can call me Joe. It was like that kind of thing where I was like, it's Tom, he's like this Tom. I'm like, yeah. He's like, cool. Hey Man, let me ask you something. Like, everything changed. As soon as I said, you don't have to be professional with me. And he goes, uh, he goes, can I ask you something? And I was like, yeah. And he goes, do you smoke weed? And I was like, ah, yeah, I mean, I guess, yeah. He's like, do you want to smoke some now? And I was like, really?

Speaker 5:          01:54:50       I was like, I was like, yeah. All right. And then you said, Yo, right? Yeah. Okay driver, that's exactly what you're comfortable with you in my life. And then he goes, he starts smoking and then he goes, uh, I can't drive unless I'm fucked up. That's a quo [inaudible] God. And then Judd Apatow, I swear to God, Shit like seventies and then he goes, and then he's like this more like this, particularly in his early, he drives fast. He's like, one of these, I've been driving 50 years in La, we've got to take this street. And I was like, you know, I was basically like keep it together man. And he was like, he was like, I've been up since, you know, three. And then I'm like [inaudible] shit. And I started asking him, I'm like, have you done other drugs? He's like, aw buddy buddy. Like I've done all.

Speaker 5:          01:55:43       And I was like, really? He's like coke heroin. And he's like, there's nothing like smoking rocks, swear to God. And I was like 17 and he is flying through El Barrio through the old neighborhood. So this is an El Salvadorian neighborhoods. Like every, like we're going through lights and he's like, look at that little brown one right there. Oh, that was a little brown guy. He was married to a Peruvian and then he had like an El Salvadorian girlfriend. He's like, I love these little brown was at oh one on the side. Yeah. Well, and yet he was like five girlfriends and they're all like 20 and they were all like 20th. So we drive to the ghetto and he'd be like, that's where I used to buy this neighborhood's good stuff.

Speaker 5:          01:56:29       God. So we're in the, we're driving around and I go, uh, I go, oh, I go, what? Can I ask you something now that we're friends, I guess, you know? And he's like, yeah, it's true. And I was like, what's it like to smoke crack? And he goes, oh man. He's like, what I like to do and when I smoked crack is like, I'll just sit in my apartment where, wait, stop, stop. Don't say anything. Did he say porn? Who Watches porn? No, no, go ahead. I'm sorry. He goes, uh, I like to, I like to look through the people and I look around at what the fucks out and I think I see all the shit I think about what's going to happen next. I see people walking by and I just kind of fucking freak out, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:57:08       And I was like, this sounds terrible man. But he was, he was like, as part of the rush, that's the rush. You know what the [inaudible] is rush to stop you because yeah, everybody says everybody that I've ever talked to him and smoked crack, he says they watch porn when we fucked like animal. Yeah. Yeah, he did say that. Sorry, say his last name. Henry the ape. So the best is like in this sounds like it sounds, I swear this is exactly how it goes. I go, so do you still do that shit? And he goes, Nah man, Nah, no. He goes, well, you know, every once in a while, but you know what they say if you do something every once in a while, it's not that bad for you. And I go, I think they mean that about like pizza, like chocolate [inaudible] I swear to God, every once in a while we'll, do you remember when the mayor of Washington DC got caught smoking Marion Berry? Yeah. With an FBI agent or an informant. A prostitute. Yeah. You remember that shit? He was smoking crack and running the nation's capitol. And then when they ask people about it, the greatest thing was after he got caught, this guy, I remember this guy on TV, they say, what do you think about the mayor getting caught smoking crack goes man. And by some, a little crack of it now. And then he said, everybody smoke a little crack every now and then this guy was on TV. It's like, come on

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       man, stop playing. You stop playing. Who doesn't? Who doesn't vote crack? I smoked some great little now. And then I was on Opie and Anthony and he was in the hallway. We were in the serious studios, you know, so there's, there's a big window you could see who's walking down the hallway and Marion Barry was walking down the hallway. So, uh, one of the interns from the opiate Anthony show, or maybe it was, was it Eric? Who Was it? He went out and grabbed him, grab Marion Barry and brought him into one of the most hostile radio shows in the history of the fucking human race because of the best. So yeah, he sits some area of barrier there and we just started asking him questions about getting caught with crack. And one of the things he says, nobody knows what was in that pipe. Oh, what?

Speaker 1:          01:59:23       That's you, you were sweating and saying, I wasn't doing that pipe. And I'm like, well, there was a video or you smoking Craig isn't, nobody knows what was in that pipe like we, wow. Wow. Still denying it political. How political. Very. He's still got a career. He's still out there making it happen. He's out there. He was running for something. Yeah. And he also did become arrogant, but he also, he ran for something during the last elections. I forget what it was. Maybe. Well, you know what, man, a lot of what being a fucking mayor is about is not what you do with your freak time. It's about what you do with your, the rest of the time they felt like he was actually representing them. So he was out there just keeping it real by smoking, do a crack every now and then. I'm there for you with that guy. He wasn't annoying, man. Come on with this. What is this now? Since Ted Haggard? Yes. Yeah. Not only is he back, but he's brilliant and the way he approaches it, that everyone in his whole thing, oh, we have drug dealers and prostitutes and everybody looking to be saved. You know, it's like we've all lost our way, but God is still there and I'm still going to lead you to God.

Speaker 1:          02:00:35       I'm still married, but he's gay as fuck. Fuck. He's, uh, he's just, you know, he's, he's, uh, he's just fighting it. That shit. You just ran the gamut. What? You watch that, you watch that documentary and you see him with his wife and they're like the drive and they're just trying to get the car. But he's like, he's, as he's talking, you're like, man, you would be so much happier if you would just get up, be like, I'm totally gay. I'll see you later. Just go be happy man. Like you. You don't have to be that miserable. Well then there's that, but there's also the intoxication of being a leader. Yeah. He loves it. He's addicted to that. Yeah. A lot of the behavior is not genuine. A lot of what his behavior is, his, he's behaving the way he thinks people were, are going to accept the way he thinks people are going to find admirable and how, you know, it's like his, his real behavior.

Speaker 1:          02:01:23       He like, he's not being honest with himself and if he's not being honest with themselves, how the fuck could he be honest with other people? He's gaining control and all these other people's lives, you know, and, and fighting off the lack of control. He hasn't at all know he needs to be like a leader of a church. Needs to be the speaking right. He wanted, he's like praise the critical piece of shit. You on your mind phobic. Meanwhile he's smoking meth and again, gay huggers, Morris, kind of hypocritical once all the congressmen, absolute all the guys that tell you how to live and criticize you. Cora, you live. Why? Why would you care if if you look, I don't want to, I might not want to live on Santa Monica Boulevard while the fucking gay parade is going on. I don't know. I mean I don't want it to be so that I can't drive it in my driveway without tripping over dudes on my lawn. I don't want it to be that bad. Can you mentioned tripping over boners that'd be so weird. Cough out of the ground. That piece of human shit. Who is that? He's running for the Republican presidential. He's a huge homophobic piece. It's probably good. He also, he also wants to, he wants to make, not only is it really

Speaker 5:          02:02:40       not just abortion, he wants to take away birth control to control the Queen. Cause he said that's not what it's for. If you're using birth control like you're not there for few, well

Speaker 1:          02:02:50       who the fuck are you? Stupid. Well, you know, it's, people with their priorities are so out of whack. Like why would you even be that good? Why would that be what you want to consult? You give a shit, people having sex, you want to take a way birth control you crazy answer. You want to make people, it make it easier for people to get pregnant accidentally because that's God's will morons even care about what the gays are doing because he wants some gate dick fighting off the gay chosen now. Right? Real motherfucker all day, all day, all night. Clon off that gay trying to push it back.

Speaker 5:          02:03:24       No. Say Allen dates. It's a sad thing when you see these poor fucking people suppressing people. You know, what do you think about this occupy Wall Street shit, I haven't talked to you about this. What's your take on all of this? Uh, I think it's great that a group of people want to like feel this way about, there's a lot of inequality. I think it's, it's great, like collectively the problem, like the real flaw in occupy Wall Street and he, the things is that there's not a clear set of what they're trying to achieve. It almost like this, you know, uh, over like let's just do this collectively as society. We're making a statement about being the 99% and you guys, the 1% has and where the have nots. But I think it would have been more effective if they had had like a clear list of like this is what we want to accomplish.

Speaker 5:          02:04:14       And it was, it's more, I feel like having watched it from outside, I'm not an expert on it by any means, but it just feels like it's more of a statement and you go, Oh yeah, it makes people aware, but there isn't really like, you know, course of action. They're not really trying to figure that out for sure. So I think, you know, it's interesting and I think the message really, this if I feel like what I get from it as if is if you really could get a lot, and I mean a ton of people behind a certain idea, you can affect change. We're not going to see, I don't think we're seeing a lot of change from the entire occupy movement, but the idea, it kind of lays out for you that like they could take over a park or a square or a street and disrupt that days, you know, normal function. And if you were to magnify that, if you were to multiply the number of people there and you really had people saying we are not going to stand for this, it leads me to believe that you would, you could affect change. Do you know what I mean? Sure. It's a whole culture.

Speaker 9:          02:05:16       No, this is what's really interesting is that this only, it's only been around for like what, 90 days or something like that. I mean, how many days? Yeah. And you know, they did a recent poll, more than half of America supports the occupy Wall Street movement. We're not going to participate during the Vietnam War. It took five years to achieve those same numbers. It took a long time of protesting for people really thought that the war was a bad idea. You know, people in the 1950s had convinced everybody that communism was going to be a real problem. And you know, we were looking for communists in our own society and they were arresting people during the McCarthy era and stuff like that. You know, and I think during the 60s people were a tad naive too. You know, how really fucked up and creepy the government could be.

Speaker 9:          02:05:56       We had just gone a couple of generations or, or I mean rather a couple decades from world war two ending. So I think a lot of people thought that the government was, you know, just in our army was strong and we fought off the Nazis and we fought off the jabs and we're fucking America and we're not [inaudible]. And then this whole, you know, the Gulf of Tonkin incident happened and you know, we, we were brought into a ward there. There's no fucking reason to be in Vietnam for any, any American idea, for anything that any people here that would have supported, they lied to us. They lied to people they claimed were attack when weren't they made up bullshit. So I think, you know, the people are today or we are aware of all these things in a much larger numbers to, to this day. I bet a lot of people don't realize that the impetus for us getting into the Vietnam War was a hoax.

Speaker 9:          02:06:44       You know, I bet a lot of people aren't aware to this day of operation Northwoods or all the plans, you know, there was plans to blame, uh, if, if space program things went wrong, there was plans to blame it on the Cubans and attack Cuba. There was a bunch of different plans to blame things on Cubans and attack Cubans. Yeah. Yeah. There was a, they were trying really hard to figure out a way to go to war with cube cube to the point where they were going to fake attacks on American civilians. They're gonna fail. They're gonna armed Cuban friendlies to lob mortars at Guantanamo Bay and attack Guantanamo Bay. I mean, there's some crazy shit. It really is crazy. Which by the way, Guantanamo Bay, that's pretty fucking crazy too. When you think of these people that are enemies, one of them has a giant military base on your fucking country. I've been there. I've been up to, how's that like, dude? Um, well, the first thing that strikes you really is that it's

Speaker 5:          02:07:35       so beautiful. Real, and that's kind of the, the, you know, the, the thing that stands out to you is your, you, you imagine like, I'm going to a military base that also has the worlds, one of the world's most notorious prison camps, and it's all in a underdeveloped, uh, Caribbean waters because crazy rats, well, they do the banana rat fucking blow your mind, but you got to look it up. You've got to look at it. They're all over the, I look it up. They're all over the island and you shit when you first see them. Really? Yeah, they have guys, Holy Shit. God, they're all over the place. Yeah. The size of this fucking thing.

Speaker 5:          02:08:21       Oh, there's some really cool stuff. Yes. That's kind of cute for a ride. Take a banana. Right? Then here's how. Here's how bad the problem is. There's guys on base that are not like, it's not even, they're not even military guys. They got hired. They give them a 22 and their job is at night. You just drive around, you're shining up and you just show me or they like, it's not the same as a nutria. Is it there? They're not exactly the same. No. Look at this. Picture it there. Right? Tell me when. Shoot that. Shoot it when you shoot that thing, dude, it weird things. I'm handsome. One seat your babies every way there right now and I think wants to innovate, but you fucking Rad. If you left it alone with the baby, it would slowly eat its feet. Fuck yeah, it would eat your baby's feet. So you see, you see the coastline and you see the water and you see, it's basically what, how much of the Caribbean is underdeveloped. You basically see what the island looked like. She's 500 years ago. Brian, look at this picture. You get a better picture of this one.

Speaker 5:          02:09:19       Yeah. You know that, um, they got me one night, they made me scream high pitch scream this, uh, you know, a Dan Smith, the comedian. Dan Smith. Yeah. Uh, I was, I was there with him and a couple other guys, Mel Hall and uh, uh, what's his name, Patrick to gear. We were all there. And uh, we get out of this pan and they had talked about, uh, uh, we, we pull up in the van, they're like, there's a banana right, right there and the lights of the van or on, so we get out of the van and we all walk kind of clothes. And they know that. They told us, you know, they eat vegetables or like the shrub there, they're not like predatory. So we stopped, but it's still a gross, massive. So I sneak up and I'm kinda like, you know, I'm still like six feet from it and right as I squat down to like look and kind of squint my eyes, Dan runs his fingers up my, my neck like this and he goes like, oh, there it is. And I go, I scream and like run like I'm terrified at this fucking thing. It is the grossest looking for and it's massive. It's like a fucking dog man. It's a rat. The size of a dog you jump. I mean it's their gross. Oh, terrifying. And Gross Joe. Stop masturbating willing. Tom's Tom. I have to, I have to relieve myself.

Speaker 5:          02:10:31       The fears, the fears often Tara County

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       and they had like, what do they have feral that raccoons, you couldn't feed them. They're just like everywhere. Really. I don't know. Cause you know there's, there's a military base there. I did. I didn't know that they were dangerous. What was friend raccoons? I didn't, I know growing up with raccoons, I live in the La huge problem with a raccoon. When I lived in New York, lived in new Rochelle. Where's that? Michelle is right outside the Bronx. It's like a suburb. When I moved to New York, I couldn't afford to live in the city. You live in the city. It's much more expensive. So I lived in like the summers and I drove and I needed a car anyway because I drove to gigs and I had to have like a place where I could park my car because I just, no way I could afford to live in apartment in New York and have us parking spot.

Speaker 1:          02:11:15       Like you have to buy a parking spot somewhere. It's fucking brutal. It's really expensive. So, uh, I had to pull down this driveway and I would stop my car right in front of the garbage cans and when I would come home at night, it was fucking terrifying cause he's, raccoons were big, they were really big and they were really well fed because they were just fucking people's garbage cans up left and right because you know, you're dealing with a house after house after house and garbage can, if the garbage can, garbage can. So they're just eating constantly and they know exactly what the food is. So they pull the tops off that bitch throw that motherfucker on the ground. I mean they, they pull them to the restaurant and I get out of my car and this mother fucker is looking at me like fucking backwards up and shit and I'm thinking this thing charges me.

Speaker 1:          02:12:00       I'm fucked. I'm a dad. So I got a blowgun and uh, you know like with darts, you know, logo, you get that at a gun show. Went to a gun show. That was the only thing you get if you don't have a license for a gun. I got a blow gun. Did you ever say your can these motherfuckers must have known I had a blow gun. I swear to God he never came back. Really? Yeah. The raccoon never came back. It's almost like he has sensed something predatory. He sends, I was w laying a trap for his ass or he just found some fat people down the hall, got some awesome garbage look. Got their garbage every night. It's pizza cross and flock. Yeah, we got the spot. I never saw that raccoon again, but he was fucking huge man. I know people in Florida that would go hunting with a semiautomatic machine, guns down raccoons, flashlights and then with like ar 15 Florida is so crazy, Lord.

Speaker 1:          02:12:56       It is not the south. No, it's not the south and it's not the norm. It's the southern most port, part part of the United States, but it's not considered the south. Isn't that amazing? The south, does anyone have anything to do with Florida? Really? Time to south ones. Anything to do with Florida is when you go well learned. Skinner came from Florida. You got me, you got me. You got me like a hybrid. It is like a strip mall. The state dirty strip mall. Vesty even the best parts of Florida, like whenever I'm in Miami, I loved the people down there. They're fun, they're fun. I love, I love going down there and do gigs, but I always put myself in a position I, what if I had to move to Florida? What would I do? I'd be like, yeah, I just think about my kids growing up in Florida and being raped.

Speaker 1:          02:13:37       It's like a hopeless [inaudible] bro. I know. It's nice. My parents lived there. My parents live in a real nice place. There's something wrong with that state. It's not a coincidence. It's so many fucking serial killers and psychos come from that spot. That's also where you go. If you're like cycling and like we're gonna fuck some shit off snow. In my mind, I grew up or I knew a lot of shady people when I was a kid and everyone eventually went to Florida. They all went down to Florida. They moved to Florida. My fucking sister moved down to Florida or shady husband moved down to Florida. My fucking parents moved down to Florida and they're attracted to it. It's like until the sky becomes a fucking brick wall of rain. Have you ever had that happen? You got to stop your car to stop the car on the highway because you can't drive. I don't think people understand what kind of rain we're talking about.

Speaker 1:          02:14:29       Eddie Bravo had a seminar in Miami. We drove from uh, from Fort Lauderdale down in Miami. It was at like 15, 20 minutes. Not even right. We're on the highway. We can't go anywhere. You literally can't drive. And it feels like your car is getting fucked up. Whooshing down. It's like a years where the rain all in one blast. It's incredible. I highway stopped dead all the time. That's not even know about that shit. That type of rain too is like you think like, oh, that must be like a tropical storm or hurricane, which have given both of those and they're horrifying and like crazy. You can't believe that it's just rain. That's just an afternoon shower. That's just hard, man. That ain't shit that the hurricane is that times a million plus flying trees hurricane yet. Ooh. I was at a hurricane in Boston and I remember, I don't remember what year, but by the time it got up to us, everybody was just scared and huddled in and now we were, we lived in Newton. We were pretty far inland. The real people that had to worry where like the people that are on the shore and how wicked was the hurricane. It's wicked. Pisser came in and talked to every body sideways.

Speaker 1:          02:15:39       It's crazy. It's just like a big hurricane though. Is it like a three? If I had a choice between moving back to Boston and live in in Florida, I take Boston a fucking heartbeat. Hit winters and all. Fuck. Yeah. First of all, they have a sense of humor versus Florida. You'd pick, fuck, no doubt about it. Are you kidding me? Human beings and Boston. It does not compare. Just being around the human beings, you'd have way more fun in Boston. [inaudible] times more fun. I'll tell you way more fun way. The further steps smarter too. In Florida, it gets crazier, more aggressive. Miami, so you might as well be in a foreign country. I haven't fucking passport to go to Miami. Check you at the border. You guys are thinking of all the bad parts of the Florida so much. Tommy and Tommy and I do.

Speaker 1:          02:16:25       I mean, I've done a bunch of gigs in Florida. We did the Florida comedy festival. We did theater down in Miami. We've done a, the Improv a couple of times. We've done a bunch of gigs. Look, it's fun. I'm done with that, but I caught that place out of my diet and the early two thousands me and Joey Diaz used to go down there because Joey knew the guy who was the original owner is always like, let me get a drawer. He and Julia, that was back when Joey was in a dark days and it would just get money and they did. The club owners would be reluctant to give him money because he might disappear. Call you from Havana on a fucking rap dog. I don't know how to got here, but it looks like I'm stuck, you know. And uh, we would go to these, do these shows at the Miami Improv and the whole crowd would break out into a fucking discussion, like over nothing real chatty.

Speaker 1:          02:17:10       Yeah. I had a joke where I mentioned Oscar de la Hoya. Somehow or another, it was like a part of a joke that I used to do something about getting punched by Oscar de la Hoya and then somebody goes, fuck Oscar de la Hoya and it, and then it was like, he's a bitch. Julio, Cesar Chavez is the man. And then it became this fucking crazy argument amongst apes. They might as well. They might as well. Chimpanzees is, someone taught how to talk. They were just the dumbest human beings I've ever been around. And the rest of the crowd was the people who are forced to live around these more on kids. And so they would just like sighing, like shaking her head back and forth like, oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, but it was a, it was a savage crowd. Like they, they had not tamed that crowd. And because of that, the most unruly of the unruly, the dumbest of the dump. We're drawn to that club and they papered the fuck out of the room. Your original owner was, he was the GAC out hardcore and he really wasn't doing it.

Speaker 1:          02:18:08       And so he wasn't, he wasn't taking care of the place correctly. Apparently. I don't, I don't know. Try it. These, this is allegedly, this is all allegedly, I'm not trying Miami and profits. It's fun now. Fuck you. It's fun. I remember the day where I was on stage where there, this was breaking out and I stopped in the middle of my set. I go, you people are way too dominant. I'm never coming back here. I'm like, this is ridiculous. Did you come out, you came out to to a comedy show and you want to yell at out who's your favorite was like the, there was the impulsiveness. It was like there was no discipline. There was nothing. I mean it was like literally like you were around the brattiest kids ever bought, they were drinking and that somehow or another they were 21 yeah. You know the brattiest kids and just felt like they could just yell things down and it's like, does anybody ever tell you to shut the fuck ever? I know. Does anybody ever tell you to shut the fuck up because this is nonsense. This is your, you have to be a crazy person to come to a comedy club in. It'd be this unaware.

Speaker 3:          02:19:06       Well, yeah. Can I ask you something? Because this happened to me at the comedy store on Saturday. Like have you ever had someone just make a comment in the crowd or just say some shit to you that enrages you? Like it hits a trigger and you so fucking hard. That's what they're trying to do. Yeah. And you see red and you're like, I'm going to fucking like I this guy, big animated

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       troll face that. That's, that's what they have. They won. What did he say?

Speaker 3:          02:19:34       What do you do? It was so stupid. Like I was talking about birth control pill and how they market it and they always say it's to regularly, it was a dumb throw. It was a minute thing. Right. And I don't usually, I don't talk about my period. I know that's a fucking female comic. Cliche. And I know, and he, he made an audible, ugh. And I fucking, I went bonkers because he had a woman with him and in my head I'm thinking, asshole, you're with a woman. You fucked that woman. Put your mouth on her vagina. Babies come out of that. But yeah. Why are you so offended at the, at the just the sheer man? I don't, like I said, it wasn't a bit about it. I didn't go into it. It was a throwaway line I had said and it immediately, if for whatever reason I wanted to fucking kill that guy.

Speaker 2:          02:20:18       Well, because your instincts are correct. The guys that Douche bag and what was really going on was that the guy is probably insecure and he probably wanted to impress the girl by being more funny than you or by criticizing you or maybe came in with really close minded expectation. Like chicks aren't funny. His fucking truck up there, I, you know I did well, yeah, everything after that. Well, you know, one, maybe he had a shut the fuck up because he knew that he was going to get crushed and then he was our, oh my God, I'm getting no pussy now. I'm a lorry Merde a loser. Yeah. You know, he'd probably pan out. That'll probably got a little cocky. You fucking just flex them and he panicked and he went into a goddamn tailspin.

Speaker 3:          02:20:58       Yeah, I see. But then like how do you deal with people like [inaudible] say shit that makes you like, it just triggers your thing.

Speaker 2:          02:21:04       You gotta be saying, look, it's all snake poison. This is what it is. I need help. Can you get bit when you get there by snake, the first time you get fucked up, it's venomous. It's through tears. You Up, you sick, you could die. But after those fucking guys and handle snakes all the time, when they get bit those mother fuckers, they're immune to the shed because they give themselves injections of snake venom. They do it on purpose. They fork. It's like a comic forcing themselves to do a spot of the comedy store Tuesday at one o'clock in the morning giving yourself snake venom. The only people there were junkies are fucking a waste toy. Like it will work or you know, drunk tourists had just wandered in from off the street. It's not like it's a comedy kind of sewer audience. Right, right. But that snake venom, they get a little snake venom in you and after a while you become immune to it.

Speaker 2:          02:21:45       And then when people yell things out, then you can go, why are you yelling? What's going on with you? And then you, then you turn it on them and then they become a part of the show. My issue with it is then it's a different kind of comedy. People enjoy it because they love off the cuff shit. They love watching. Hackles get destroyed. People get a kick out of that shit, but at the end of the day it's a different show. You're not doing your set anymore much. What's much better is that you get to do your set unfucked with, yeah, I can do that, man. I do question and answers why? I'll do like an hour more and I'll just let people yell out anything and I talked to the people in the crowd do that all the time, but that's after I've already done my material. Man, don't interrupt. That's gross and only people that do that are

Speaker 9:          02:22:26       idiots. You have to be an idiot to yell at a movie theater. You have to be an idiot to yell at a comedy show, to try to get someone's intention to try to interrupt and inject your own bullshit. I always tell the man, look, you go to an open mic night, something hard. You could do it. I know you do. I know you're insecure and this is the easy way to do it, but really you want attention, you want attention that you don't fucking deserve, and instead of going through the proper channels to get this attention on, what you're doing is trying to usurp it from someone who has achieved it. Here you are on the stage, you've gone through the portal part of getting hired by the club. You've got television credits, you're, you know, you're established standup comedian, seasoned by the road. You're on the stage and this person literally wants to jump into your spot. Like automatically, like you serve your business. They're essentially trying to steal your bike. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 8:          02:23:06       It's, it's so, yeah. I don't agree with the mentality. I don't understand that. I would never, it's fucking crazy.

Speaker 9:          02:23:14       I would say only losers do that shit. You're not going to take a winner. There's no winner in the world. No person who's got their shit together in the world, who wants to yell out and cause attention to the south of the comedy show and that's a sign of immaturity or just a lack of objective analysis of their own self and the way they own, they behave. It's total that

Speaker 8:          02:23:33       I was more mad at myself and I let that guy sidetrack. But it's good for you. Ultimately it's good for you. It is really, you learn from that shit cause then you're like, why? Yeah, fucking why did that trigger that in me? I just wanted, I just wanted to kill him. The worst is when they come up with your herbs helping you out up there. Oh yeah. I'll bring you out. Would you show up? But I brought you been heckled a lot, right? You get heckled, don't, yeah. No, no, not really. I've seen you get gold. All right. Do you not remember? No, it was a lot of weird. No, I mean not nothing bad. Like, maybe somebody will yell something out, but nothing like, uh, like where they keep on going the whole time. You know, where it's like a real heckle back and forth. What

Speaker 9:          02:24:09       difference do you find in doing my shows as opposed to doing just random shows on the road. Your shows are just fine. Like cause they know me and that that completely is awesome because they, they already know my sense of humor. So yeah, they already know you. Silly person. Yeah. So it's already easy for you just to start. You're totally different, right? Yeah. Isn't that cool? That's the best when you have your own audience you guys are going to have it. Look, you know your, your podcasts, podcasts is fucking hilarious. And folks who haven't heard it, it's your mom's house and it's on death squad. So if you go to iTunes and if you want to look specifically for there is look for the desktop, that squad ones that say your mom's house and that's Tom and the lovely Mrs Segura and a favor. We have a lot of, a lot of fun to do a man we really enjoy doing it.

Speaker 9:          02:24:54       And we're going to put the Ice House one's folks for everybody who's been asking. That is also now going to be on death squad. So a, what it's called is the icehouse chronicles and we have a full studio set up in Pasadena and it is fucking dope. And uh, Brian has been doing all of his podcasts out of there now and yeah, it's awesome. We're going to do one out of there this Thursday. I'm not sure who's going to do it yet, but then we're going to have a show there a Thursday night. So that should be a lot of fun in a Thursday night show is a 10:00 PM show and uh, it's uh, get tickets

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       from the Ice House, ice house, comedy.com and get them quick cause it will sell out. It's only 85 seats. Uh, we did it last week and it's sold out and it was fucking awesome. And then crowd is cool and shit, man, this podcast fans are awesome. This is the greatest, smartest thing I've ever done. And it totally happened by accident. Can I ask your fans to come see me? Where are you this week? I'm going to be at the comedy mixed in the great city of Vancouver Saturday at the comedy mixed on Bernard Street. It's one of my favorites that I play is down. That is, yeah, that is the old Yuk Yuk Yuk Yuks in Vancouver. Oh, it's the, it's one of the best set up rooms in the country. Or I shouldn't say in the country, cause Canada and not just the country in North America. North America. It's a perfect setup.

Speaker 1:          02:26:10       It's low ceilings, tight seeding, great place. Nice crowd, great owner, nice guy. Nice people that work there. It's great. Yeah. Tommy and I did it last time. We did it. We did a theater on fraud. What did we do on Friday night where we go, uh, I forget the name of good here and we did a theater on Friday night and then Saturday night we, after the fights we went nuts it anymore. Is that right? I don't remember. And then after the fights we went and did, it might've been, and after the fights who went and did the comedy Max? It's fucking great. What a great little club and I started, it used to be Yuck Arcs we did as young Alex back in the day. Right. You, me and who else? Who helped did it with us? Yoshi. Yoshi. Did it going to be on the show Thursday and Thursday night? Yeah, I did it once. It's got to do more shows with Yoshi. Yeah, I like Yoshi. Alight. He's hilarious. He's friends with Asa, Akira. This girl that we had on that podcast yesterday, by the way, have you guys watched a porn video on your TV recently? Like an HD, like it's completely disgusting watching the hardcore open up your ass hole punch. I have a watch porn on it inside of these terrible things for aggressive shit.

Speaker 1:          02:27:18       There's lot of spitting and you're watching, you're watching the race you're watching right now. This guy was, he had like equal clause and he was proud of [inaudible] vagina. I don't like that. Hold the club. I'm also not like, I mean I like watching an aggressively done blowjob. Sure. But when, well to a certain extent, but when it gets into like, wow, I'm getting like stuff that shit. I don't like it aggressive at all. I don't like confusing sex with rape. I don't know. I don't mean violent. Very, very in touch with my chimpanzee instincts. And I think there's probably some dark reason why men are so much fucking stronger than women and their hot probably has a lot to do with nature wanting us to hold you down and fuck the shit out of you sometimes. Sometimes you, sometimes you fight back and we have to club you. Yeah. So I don't, I don't want to ever happen to that fucking primordial pool of being via the aggressiveness coming from the girl. I don't mean like a throat match you, that's fun to watch for a little bit. And then when they go like they puke. Yes. Dummy file on cock, isn't it? I'm not gonna lie. I don't like it. That aggressive

Speaker 3:          02:28:32       love Bella, Donna, because she's very pro. Like I just, I like her energy and I like her as a person. I got to meet her at Sam Tripoli's naughty show, but when she puts a baseball bat

Speaker 1:          02:28:41       up her ass and not, not the thin and the other. And at the end you hold off on, forget who sent me that. I think it might've been Dunkin, it was a long time ago. Someone sent me that video and a, the heading just said batter up. And so I open the email, you know, it's one of those things where someone just sends you of the email. I opened the email and then she said, I love people. Exclamation point, exclamation point, exclamation point. And then this link and I clicked the link in. This girl has a bad up her ass joyfully glow. I was like, well fuck man, someone finally did the last thing that there is to do. And then I thought about it. I'm like, wow, I wonder how long it took to do this. And then I said, well, how many people have done this?

Speaker 1:          02:29:20       So then I googled baseball bat up the ass and there's like fucking twenty eight thousand two hundred and eighty four million fucking mean. Who knows how many goddamn results there were. But there was, it was ridiculous. It's like there's a whole genre of porn. Girls stick baseball bats up each other's asses. Now. She didn't do it for it. They can't help but take it to the darkest level possible. Can you say that home had doubled, did doubling, doubling imaginary joking. In the interview I said something about double badge, which is Trey Parker and Matt stone, his band. That's why I always say it as a joke. I didn't think people actually signed it and she goes, oh yeah, a giant that were really like the center point of a kaleidoscope of male bodies, male bodies, and then to Cox in her vagina and to do that physically, physically stand. How does everybody find a good spot to stand for Asians?

Speaker 1:          02:30:12       That's not even good. They'd have to be like, they would have to be like Cirque de Solei dancers. There's video that she's in note like really good every time. Who are we talking about? Belladonnas I'll say Kira. Every video she went to or every person she went to, it just got bigger and bigger. She was fucking his black dude where his dick seriously was about the size and from my knee cap to my foot, like an inch thick that thick and she's just fucking any ass with that. It just slips right in and an ADP and it's fucking great. I put it on 3d and didn't help anything is that they hurry, hurry, get busy with it. Yeah. It's like are you ready gen? No. Like gentle slow. Well you know what it is because you know obviously there's some editing, some professional editing where they're giving you is only the most extreme aspect of the fantasy but does a lot of it of all men abusing the women. Yeah. This guy who was dragging her from one part of the house, the other party house by her hair so you would like choke her and I was stomach bile foam and stuff like that. Then he would have just dragged across into the other

Speaker 11:         02:31:20       room by her hair and throw in the ground and then shove his hand in her pussy so hard. It was just juicing everywhere and they would smack her and she bit him in the hand at one point and he drew blood and he's like, look what you did to me, take this. And then he just put his big cock and Hazmat is crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:31:40       The incidence of rape has gone down with this Japanese philosophy. I don't know if it's true. I don't know if it's makes sense. Look, I think sexual suppression is responsible and then also the lack of xpression is responsible for a lot of things that people do where they act out and do something fucked up. But then are how many people are going to be inspired by these videos to actually do it, to get the ultimate thrill and do it in real life. I don't know. Do you guys ever switch it up in the bedroom? Like Tom Dresses up

Speaker 11:         02:32:12       the woman and you dress up as the guy, he'll whatever, whatever. Here's the shoes with the heels I put on her Wednesday, I go, well let me ask you this time cause you're, yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:32:27       you're a big sports fan. What do you think about the whole Oscar de la Hoya getting caught wearing women's clothes where you just know it just really admitted it. He caught caught a long time. I caught a while and he said it was all Photoshop nonsense but he recently admitted it because he said it's been haunting him and apparently like this other grant on him out, another girl had just came out and did an interview and said that this was like he would do, he would corner everybody wouldn't let the girls leave, like intimidate them and he'd be like wearing girls clothes and hang out with them and talking like a girl. I think. I mean I totally buy it and I mean I think it's quirky but I think you know when you hear like a story about somebody and you're, your brain always does the assessment of like, can I see this person doing that? When I heard that initially about Oscar de la Hoya, I was like, you get over the like the what? What? What's the story? And then I was like, oh, I could see that. I can, I could see that. Like you said, like Bernard Hopkins did it. I'd be like not ever was a cross dresser and he was sure j Edgar Hoover was, my understanding of cross dressing is that it is not necessarily related to homosexuality. That doesn't make any sense to me. Seems Pretty Queer from where I'm sitting.

Speaker 11:         02:33:28       It might be a different flavor of queer. I might not be your standard genetic. I was born gay,

Speaker 1:          02:33:33       queer, but it's still, I think, I think it leads to something to it. Yeah. There's some on and I respect him. I look, I'm, by the way, I have zero problem with any kink that you have, right. If you want to wear, I'm not criticizing him going anyway. I don't want to get confused. I respect that guy. I think he's a great fighter, is great fun, interesting guy and a very brilliant businessman. And if he wants to wear dresses, I think he's wore dresses. I don't give a fuck. You know, it's just weird. I say that what it is to just fun. He is fun. Guys like him. I think he, um, uh, I think, I think if he were to, I don't know if he's from here. He's still like, he uh, if you were promote fights in address,

Speaker 11:         02:34:12       that would be, well, there's a Japanese, I would go watch, I forget

Speaker 8:          02:34:18       the guy's name. I'll look it up real quick because I don't want to end this on a bad note. There's a Japanese kickboxer that's a crossdresser all man. Oh yeah. He comes into the, well, he comes, it's part of his walk in entrance. He comes in to the, it comes into the ring with the fucking wig on and pigtails and dressed up like a school girl. The fuck out of people. I mean, he's a, he's a bad ass kickboxer and a tech scene that's different guys. We don't, we don't really, you know, it's like sort of cross dressing. If I dress like a guys that aren't at the most straight men don't have any desire to wear a dress kilt. Let your balls loose a little bit. That's about as far as it goes, right? Yeah. I mean there's more utility in me wearing pants. Yeah. Then guys wearing a girl's Thong before? No, it's really pointless. Why did you wear a song? I spent the night at the girlfriend's house recently and I didn't have any underwear and I think given her own words, she's like, I only have thongs. And I'm like, so I tried it. It's pretty much pointless. Why? Why do you even bother?

Speaker 8:          02:35:26       Because you're like, I need underwear. Right. As long as the only thing around stupid. What's your asshole bacteria on your vagina to Euston facts in that way? Yeah. You got to get some full back cotton breathers like mommy, where's you know that you are not supposed to move your Dick from the dictum? I didn't have for a while. [inaudible] you know little girls, I'm a little young. Girls are oftentimes get sick because they wiped their ass and correctly cause they wiped their ass into their vagina. You've got to teach them to wipe their ass the wrong way or they can get septic. It's fucking dangerous, man. It's like you can get really sick, like real bad and that's how sickening get from going butthole to vagina. Yeah. I never really had to deal with that. I guess until recently. You in your mouth, Huh? You get shit on your balls standing up with one leg on the front to back.

Speaker 8:          02:36:23       Yeah. He likes his balls. A shitty sort of a [inaudible] side hurts less to the other side. Last, what do you mean he abuses his ass hole? Yeah, he uses plugs a lot while we're searching. Also, David, tell him to my brother paper towels a lot to wipe you do not flush that shit. That will, that will destroy your whole entire plumbing. Nagashima that's the dude. The dude, his name was Nagashima. Nagashima is the Japanese gentleman who dresses up like a girl and even in this, look at this. Check this out. What does he take a look at? This? Yeah, he's a bad ass and knocked out Shinya Oak. He's one of the best MMA guys in the world. This is him with a wig on dress like a girl. This one's a blonde one. He wears deadlines all the time. Shima voicemail. Oh Dude, he's a, he destroyed Shinier. The end of the ring that like cause yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          02:37:16       That's how he's looking. Here's another one of him. Look at this this way. It's got a blue wig on and is dressed like a girl. I love the Japanese and he beats the fuck out of people. In your opinion, is that like he's gay? This is like I'm taking my gay rage to the ring. I mean, I don't know for sure. There's been some gay fighters, but the no one's ever come out and he's that guy. No, no. He might not be gay. Might just be just for fun. Boxers, MMA fighters. Am I gay boxers as well? And Bill Griffith is a famous, a famous by the way, champion. And He, uh, he, uh, there was a guy who taunted him and the guy wound up dying. Bernie and [inaudible], I think the guy's name was Brittany paret. I forget the guy's name, but he killed him in a fight in, I believe it was in New York, in a boxing match. And the guy had taunted him for being gay. Yeah. There's, you know, there's some, yeah, there's gay.

Speaker 9:          02:38:11       That's not smart that somebody told me about a show in New York. I forget at what club were one of the comics was making like, I don't know, gay jokes, but like doing just like you know like gay slurs and I don't know what he was saying and there was a big like jacked up dude and the audience who just came onstage and just punched him like twice knocked about Jesus Christ about comics is that we don't become serial killers or pedophiles. What about that rapist? That was the, the one guy was the cruise liner guy who would go to colleges and shit and rape girls. Asked him to pray for him who was raped them and ask them to pray for him. Yeah. Meal Griffith was widely known as being a gay man and there were the, he had a fight with this guy, Benny Perrey in 1962 for the welterweight championship and the guy had taunted him about being gay and he'd beat them to death.

Speaker 9:          02:39:01       Jesus. He'd beat that fucking guy to death other than that. But other than that, there's a few and far between people. People have been recognized as being gay. We told the story on the podcast about this one guy who got caught in an MMA promotion. Well, there isn't another guy who was a out guy who fights in MMA fights. I forget his name right now. It escapes me. Shane, Shane Smith I think. Um, but he's out. Like they've done stories about him, The New York Times and Chad Smith, that's his name. And um, this other guy, they caught him because they researched his name and they found out that another guy with the same name and done a bunch of gay porns and then he just vanished. She just disappeared. Stop fighting. But other than that, no one is there, but no one's ever come out there up.

Speaker 9:          02:39:42       Chad Smith character for a lot of people. Do they tap into, yeah, for a lot of people it'd be a big deal. Does it happen? Does that mean instead of tapping out, oh, Brian, you silly goose. And with that note, Oh, I want to say thank you to Lorenzo from the psychedelic salon podcast. I listened to a couple podcasts.
