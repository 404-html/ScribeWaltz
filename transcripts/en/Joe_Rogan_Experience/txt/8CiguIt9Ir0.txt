Speaker 1:          00:00:15       What's wrong with you or you started already? You already had started. We just, I just, we just went live. Hey everybody. Fuck what's going on? We understand folks. We hear your story. You hear your plight that a ustream has been fucking up for you. Uh, it's been, um, what it was called? Buffering. It just lost my mic. You know what I've noticed though, Joe, is that browsers, so if, if it's fucking with you on one browser, tried different one because the flash plugin alone has been just a connie bitch. Is that what it is? Yeah, like a, like on Youtube, Youtube. I have problems on certain browsers where it does certain things and I changed it around and I've been noticing is a lot of browser issues. I use chrome for the most part. What do you use? I use safari. I went back to so far.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       Why did you go back too far? Because it seems like it's usually the best when it comes to working with everything, but it's crazy. It's been fucking with everything. It didn't use to write. It didn't use to be the best one. I don't think so. No, but it's always been solid for me. Crumbs. Good. But the problem with chrome is that I just go crazy with extensions and next thing I know if he fucks things up like ad block plus or whatever, that shit fucks things up and then you forget that. That might be the reason why you know you almost so far, every type of motherfucker. This episode, speaking of the web is brought to you by squarespace. You go to squarespace.com, forward slash rope.

Speaker 1:          00:04:01       Yeah. And you don't owe anybody any money or something. Something. Yeah. I've had people who have been fucked over. Like you could do an llc at legal zoom for only 100 bucks. So if you want to start fucking people off, it's only 99 bucks and then somehow or another, I don't know

Speaker 2:          00:04:18       what happened to get a will at that time, which you could also do at legal zoom. That's another good idea.

Um, what was the other one? I had to do? Square stamps.

Speaker 1:          00:05:14       Legals. Oh, stamps.com. Stamps.com. Which is appropriate because the new desk squad shirts are on preorder as of right now. If you go to a desk, [inaudible] dot TV. My favorite of all the designs that Brian has created, I actually love this one. That's fucking bad ass. I love the cat. And the last one, he was my favorite cat, but this is a cool shirt. This is a, I love the colors too. And it's um, it's a very high quality shirt as opposed to. It's not that the other ones were low quality but they're like the standard way you get a t shirt when you have like a big design. Like that desk squad logo is, they just, they take like a vinyl, I don't know, it's fine or whatever it is, but some sort of static.

Speaker 2:          00:05:50       It's like a thick. It's the process is just a bunch of. It's like it feels to have a plastic shield on. So like when you're working out you feel like this, like, like you almost have armor on and it's very uncomfortable when you have a lot of colors when you get sweaty. Yeah, yeah. If you get sweaty it gets weird. So this, this process actually bleaches the shirt and then read the ink in it. So it's actually the, the, the, just, just the cotton, so you can't even feel the design. So it's an upgrade from the last couple of shirts I did. So I wanted to have a little bit better quality.

Speaker 1:          00:06:17       Yeah. Well, you know, he saw how my higher primates shirts be rocking it and like damn son. Why they so sweet. Oh you know, because of my man, Mike Maxwell draw me something funky. Champs. That's right. Um, so uh, yeah. So these would be coming up really soon. So jump on him now. Um, they, I mean I see a shit load of these old ones every time I performed, including this past weekend when Joey Diaz, when I wear a rock in the joint and Vegas. Goddamn son. Fuck God. Damn. We'll talk about that. We'll talk about that. We'll talk about the UFC and more legal stamp doc. Um, and legal squarespace dot zoom. No, I'm just kidding. No I didn't get the stamps. Dot Com site. Really real fuck up. Could you imagine if I was that far? High stamps.com. If you go there, if you click on it, they have that old school microphone in the upper right hand corner.

Speaker 1:          00:07:07       Well, if you click on that old school microphone and enter in the code name j e r e, which stands for the jail Rogan experience. You can save an ass load of money, including um, it's $110 thing off. You get a free scale, a digital scale which you are not to use for marijuana. Sir. This is for sending packages. Asshole. Okay. You Do, do not send. Listened to me. Do not send marijuana through the post office use ups because the post office that's like, it's against the law. They'll put you in a fucking cage. It once, they'll break your shit and Hollywood and take the weed themselves. They're fucking savages. And you can't blame. If I was a mailman, I'd be ripping up a envelope. Students get sent that. Yeah, it's the code. The codes of sweet code. You save a lot of money off of what they normally offer, but even if he didn't have my code, it's a great deal. And you get this sweet digital scale. And what you do is you print, like say if you're selling anything like Brian selling those t shirts, you just make it yourself, have it printed up yourself and you just weigh the packages on a digital scale. You print up everything off of your computer or Boehm handed to the postmaster. Done.

Speaker 2:          00:08:14       I used it today actually. I haven't used the mail in a long time and I didn't have a stamp. I'm like fuck, I got to go to the store and like, Oh yeah, I have stamps.com and I just put the envelope in the printer. Bam, boom it in the mailbox. It's so easy kid. You can't go

Speaker 1:          00:08:27       wrong. Go to stamps.com and use the code j r e and save yourself some money on an excellent service. And I'm supposed to say something official to give you shit to sale like something official, but

Speaker 2:          00:08:43       it's $110 value. Yeah, it's what it is,

Speaker 1:          00:08:46       is a really good deal. That's what I think about stamps.com. I think it just totally makes sense if you're. If you're smart, like why would you want to go to the fucking post? Joe Rogan sell them that I'm talking to. You don't have that many years left. I don't have 20 minutes to go down there and wait for the fucking. It's a nightmare. Going to be a lot more than 20 minutes if you go to the wrong post office. The wrong time. I've been there before where it took me an hour and 10 minutes just to go. Yes. Yeah. There was a gang of people and they all had shit to way that were all saying it was around Christmas. I was an asshole. I was like, wow, this is bad. I hate going up. Boy. I got a box at the Po box. I go there.

Speaker 1:          00:09:22       You gotta give it together with online and I forget to go and I get emails from people. They sent my shit back. Yeah, and I don't want to burden these fucking people either. Who wants to be the 30th person in line that day with stacks of shit for them to send out and they're tired of doing your God damn work for you? Stamps.com. Just needs to get a passport thing because that's the only reason I have to go to the post office now it's for like when you have to do things like passports are showing that just it's annoying because you're mixing passport. People in with fucking regular mail people. Pat Bluebeam. Like getting a new passport. Is that what you mean? Yeah, that's where I got my passport recently. It was a pain in the ass at the post office today. And why is that together?

Speaker 1:          00:10:01       A dozen drugs, tobacco and firearms and tobacco, Tobacco, alcohol and firearms. They're all together. Like how? What the fuck is why those three together? That's ridiculous. Passports and stamps. So you can send a package or you. Yeah, whatever you're sending through the air. I mean Joe Rogan. Why would drugs tobacco and show up to a rescue for tobacco? Like if you were selling them with stickers on me. Well you could sell stolen shit. It could be that you could be, yeah, you could be like not having a tax stamp or something, so like you're a company that's trying to sell it and not pay taxes on it. People are crazy, man. You always hear about people that are like running businesses for a couple of years. Gangster style cash, only pay no taxes and then they just vanish and it happens all the time. You know, there was a.

Speaker 1:          00:10:55       We had this lady yesterday from the Oxycontin Express who was talking about those pain clinics of Florida and one of them was cash only. They were there for two years. He made $40,000,000 and then they got arrested. When they hook you up with some oxy? Yeah, if you're a. If you're interested, go listen to it because she was a. The whole story was fucking amazing. We can talk about that on the podcast because I know. Oh all day dog. We just got off oxy and out to get a little beautiful. We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com. As always. I can't say it in a different way. I've tried. I've tried that commercials in a different way. I've tried, if you've never heard this podcast before on a dessert company and full disclosure that I have a financial stake in, uh, and essentially we sell really just shit that I use shit that Aubrey and I use shit that people use it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:49       They're trying to get in shape. It's like we sell a lot of kettlebells and we have these things called primal bells or kettlebells with this cool chimpanzee face we had sculpted into it. It's pretty bad ass medicine balls. All those types of things you need for strength and conditioning workouts. I'm the type of full body workouts that are, think are the most beneficial as far as like application in sports or in your everyday life and just picking up shit, you know, you don't pick up shit just by curling things if you're smart, use your whole body. And when you do exercises like kettlebells and steel maces and club bells, um, the, those are the type of strength and fitness, uh, pieces of equipment that sort of emphasize those style of workouts, the style workouts where you use your whole body as one unit instead of like really breaking things down to like isolation exercises, which, you know people used to do back in the day.

Speaker 1:          00:12:38       And it's okay if you want to look all sex, you have some sex, a biceps. If that's your only goal, then go, go, go, you fucking sexy Quito. You do those curls. Get your, the back of your triceps on one of those, curling those. Remember those things, show ideas, those preacher curls. Everybody would do that. Everybody wanted the big guns to preach a curl, one of the least useful positions. Do you ever find yourself in double arm barred? Hanging over a couch? Doing curls anyway, go to [inaudible] dot com. Use the code name Brogan and save yourself some shackles. Joey Coco Diaz is here and we're fixing to get busy. Okay? Check yourself before you wreck yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:13:24       Big Dixon Yas Day.

Speaker 3:          00:13:37       Bang son. We back, we live, we would, Joe Diaz, Joe, he gave me a pot candy and I got high holding in my hand. Okay. I held it in my hand. I got nervous. That's the people broke it up into hybrid sativa and Indica and that is even run as easy was saying. He likes to cheap but shoes, but he likes to full boat one. The white label really goes deep. Death redness there on long island and go in and I've had them with coffee in the morning before a flight and they fucking picked me up. I will drink energy drinks because I did blow. But these things fucking picked me right up. So not bad. This is the, I gave you the pain relief on to. Okay. These guys are going deep. If you, um, if you do an energy drink, it makes you want to do blow. No, no, no. I did blow for all those years so they don't work. Oh, fucking red balloon. Go to sleep. I drink coffee and go to sleep to be honest. Take you to that too. I could drink a cup of coffee. Used to be able to do that when I had sleep apnea. I did fucking just hit the crib right after a cup of coffee. Yeah, it's amazing. Oh my God. I need to start a drink to start boxing. Fucking passed out. Get the fuck out of Cuban coffee. Fucks up that

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       uh, not Persian coffee. Is that what it is? Greek coffee. There's some coffee that's fucking out there that the cola, the caffeine is just outrageous Greek or one of those countries. Those coffees that people think are like really strong. It's like the taste of it. It's not necessarily the caffeine like, you know, I guess out everybody assumes Espresso's like stronger than a cup of coffee. Not really. No. It's actually weaker. It as less. The lighter coffees are the ones with the more caffeine, like a dark, dark coffee. Apparently a dark coffee doesn't have as much caffeine as like a lighter coffee. Oftentimes like when you burn them more, I guess to make it dark maybe. Does that make sense? We roasted it longer. What am I talking about? Overhead, but the first time I ever had Cuban coffee, I'm like, oh, this is like everything else Cubans do.

Speaker 4:          00:15:39       It's crazy. You take coffee, you put a half a pound of sugar in it from the start. They make sweets. I couldn't believe how Sweden as we were working in Miami at the Improv and Joey's like, you got to try to Cuban coffee dog. Fuck all that stopped book shit. That's for girls. Have you been to Miami International Airport and see that starbucks is always empty. That's fun and compete because it's a quarter. It's thirty five cents for a shot. I know 35,000, 85 at the airport and if they give you the sugar mixed into it, you don't even feel guilty for putting them a cigarette and uh, you know, you're like, hey, I asked for. It's like a dessert. I didn't know it's a desert and there's a little pick me up, but people think there's more than. There is apparently a Venti starbucks. I mean, you can get more. Yeah, I think no, I don't think mountain dew that they put a bunch of caffeine in a while ago. Maybe they took it off the market by now.

Speaker 2:          00:16:39       That's the one that made me go to Cedar Sinai for having a panic attack. Yeah, it was that exact same drink. Mountain dew made you go to the hospital. That was the one where I pulled over on the side of the road and they, they, they, they like the. I sat on the curb with my phone out with. I had nine slash 11 and had one about to push enter a just because I felt like I was having a heart attack. You feel Brian? It felt like your heart's going hi to know I wasn't high or in high school. I had not eaten that day but I had one of those to wake me up. Yeah. But it was a big ass. I mean this was like a, like a humongous, like, like a size of a c too. Like what is that? Like 18 hours and then it's like 16 to 18. Yeah. Yeah, but. But they, they checked me, the ambulance checked me like, dude, your heart's going crazy. We need to get you inside. And then they put a whatever that water in your blood is, because I said I was dehydrated and stuff. They give you like an Ivy tripp and they gave me an Ivy Tripp, but it costs me like $3,000 for this fucking mountain dew.

Speaker 4:          00:17:41       That's incredible. Isn't it amazing how much it costs for an ambulance to come and just look at it

Speaker 2:          00:17:46       was $900. Don't sign the paperwork at the end, tell them, run

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       out of it. So when they tried

Speaker 4:          00:17:52       900 bucks. Okay. Is it for their time? Is it

Speaker 2:          00:17:56       the surface? It's like most expensive limo in the road, man. If I was rich I'd be just using ambulances cause you can go through lights to say you have a heart attack. I'm just kidding. Seriously. That's brilliant. Brilliant. That's like a felony. No felony calling an ambulance, an ambulance company and you go through all the right paperwork and you're like, you know, I need to be picked up

Speaker 3:          00:18:19       dude. If this wasn't a comedy podcast, just because when you say you probably go to jail under the Patriot Act, it was like a crazy, brilliant wing. That is brilliant. So brilliant guy in Long Island right now I'm going to open up an ambulance company. I'm going to run dog. That's brilliant. And they'll do it till they get fucking pulled over. What's going on here and the heart. Oh good. No, no. I told her if I had the lights I could run through.

Speaker 2:          00:18:49       Well No, and if you get pulled over, you're just in the back seat and go, all right, stay that. You're having a panic attack and we'll just take it to the hospital. Well there was a

Speaker 4:          00:18:56       guy when I lived in Newton, Massachusetts, there was a guy who were, which by the way, I went back to recently and I couldn't believe how

Speaker 3:          00:19:04       mall it was. It was really weird. It's weird when you go back home and then you realize how small everything was and you don't know what happened. Especially like Boston area, like it was all those little towns.

Speaker 4:          00:19:15       We're separated by these little two lane roads. It's really weird. It's really weird to go back to it. Um, I don't forget it.

Speaker 3:          00:19:23       Oh, you went back home and you, uh, you went to Newton? I don't fucking know either. Well, what would you, what did you say

Speaker 4:          00:19:30       before that?

Speaker 2:          00:19:32       But the ambient ambulance, that guy,

Speaker 4:          00:19:33       was that sort of A. Sorry, sorry folks. A Guy, um, was using the ambulance, like it wasn't going to an emergency. It's just using it because he wanted to get home or whatever you want to do. Whatever the fuck you wanted to do. We wanted to go through the slide and he slammed in this woman and killed her and it was, it was bad, you know, I mean they wanted him dead. I remember this like people were, were fucking really upset that someone died because someone abused a public thing like that, that, you know, people, you know, people expect that if an ambulance is coming through it's risking safety because trying to save a life. And this deck was just driving around and thought it was cute to run red lights. So I took through. So you know, slammed into center.

Speaker 3:          00:20:14       I always pull over, I see p play a cop one, but three cop cars went by me, me and maybe two other people pulled it over. That lady, they don't [inaudible] pull over. Pull over. Yeah. It's scary. It's scary. Yeah. People are dickish man. They like to wait for other people to pull over so they can pull over and follow the ambulance and like cut a path through. I've seen people do that. They don't

Speaker 2:          00:20:33       do it at all out here. I mean Ohio, everybody, everybody. I just saw and I'm like, this is fucking rude. California. Some of the worst driving manners I've ever, ever, ever. It's so rare. First of all did ever gets out of the fast

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       lane. You know, it's amazing. When you watch someone in the fast lane, then you watched someone pull up behind them and you see them just sit there and then the process to go around like they look and they know and they know they're going slow, they're going 60 get out of the lane. They don't want to get more info in the east coast. You dealing with these little two lane roads, two lanes on each side, so everybody who's going slow, it goes to the fucking right. You don't want to move to California. It's like everything else. It's like such a wealth of lanes out here. There's so many fucking lanes on the highway. The people that gang and yet the name man, u go

Speaker 2:          00:21:34       check this out. Have you seen this? Rethink your drink. That's just how much sugar is in each. A different kind of drink? I think it is. Oh my God. Look at red bull. Holy Fuck. Is that real or is that caffeine? Caffeine. That's sugar. Oh my God. Look how much sugar's in red bull. That's insane. The same as that small mountain dew though. It is, right? Oh my God. I didn't even a regular size mountain dew it looks like. And you know what? Here's the other thing. It'd be better if it was actually sugar in there and that was their sugar in water. Is that what that is? This thing. Fucking water. Bottled water. How's that possible now? True. Zero, but show zero. Red Kool aid. I think that's just a refresh. I think that's just a reflection. Yeah. Yeah. Right. It's trying to get you to drink water, obviously.

Speaker 2:          00:22:22       Yeah. You mean that little packet of Koolaid. That's ridiculous. That's the same amount as a little weight. Chocolate milk. That's crazy. Yeah. There's a lot of sugar in our lives folks. We're kind of hooked on that. Yeah. I'm trying not to drink coffee right now and I've been drinking this Trenta sized passion fruit ice tea everyday. It has no caffeine in it, but I don't get the sweetener in it and I get splenda and that's just. Yeah, but it's got to give you brain cancer, but the night much splenda that drinking that much Stevia go with the Stevia, but starbucks doesn't have Stevia for someone home. She got a gang of him here. Why don't you. Why don't you think starbucks goes on, Steve, too expensive.

Speaker 4:          00:23:02       I don't know. Maybe they have a deal with splenda to keep people from knowing about Steve. Yeah. Suppressing knowledge. Dog suppressing that herbal goodness. Stevie is delicious. I. It took me a little while to get used to it, but knowing that it's an herbal sweetener and then if there's like literally no strings attached, it's just your body takes it in. It doesn't seem to have any. My talent truth as it seemed to have any health

Speaker 2:          00:23:28       very recently. I heard some stuff in that. That's why people were telling me to go to something else. That other one, it's like with x or aZ or a Xavier.

Speaker 4:          00:23:36       Oh, xylitol salad part. I've heard that as well. Like some people like the Xylitol.

Speaker 2:          00:23:42       There was a reason that people were saying something recently about Stevia. Maybe I'm wrong. Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       well let's go. Go, go. What's wrong with Stevia? What do you do Joe Ago? Straight stab. A little Stevie at the House that rob gave me. I have the blue packages. I like it because it's super strong. I have sugar too, which I don't use every once in a while with the new coffee machine. I'll. I'll make a Cuban coffee, but you know what's crazy dog? The biggest addiction I ever had was to Coca Cola and with the weight watchers I stopped drinking soda and it was like the toughest three months of my fucking life. God is like, I thought it was worse than getting off the blow, not having like Chinese food or something with a coat. The other day. I had, I went to someplace to eat and the guy goes, we're out of diet coke. I said, you know what, give me a coat. It was fucking horrible. It's too sugary. Oh my God. Ridiculous. Oh my fucking God. That was terrible

Speaker 4:          00:24:36       sweat. This stevie is used as a weight loss aid. It's used for treating diabetes, high blood pressure and heartburn for lowering uric acid levels and for preventing pregnancy. Also for increasing the strength of the muscle contractions that pump blood from the heart. Wow. Yeah. That doesn't seem like you could eat that all day. It seems like. It seems like if you ate that all day, you'd have some fucking issues. I mean, maybe we should talk to tate. He could be our patient zero because that dude's got stevie and his system all day. He just drinks those mugs. Have bulletproof coffee. I should give a plug to tate too, because tate just started his own a mobile coffee business. He's doing a butter coffee truck and they um, they, I guess they roll around. It's called rolling butter. It's rolling underscore butter on twitter and he's got like a butter coffee truck, all sorts of different flavors and shit and he shows up at crossfit events. Those crossfit guys are junkies for that butter coffee, like bulletproof coffee with mct oil in it. So tate decided to set up a truck and just roll around and had his first event this week. So you need to go to the arnold classic. Oh yeah. But the last thing you want to do is take a fucking truck all the way to Ohio, especially in March, in March in Ohio, son, you might get fucked. That shit my go ugly on you. It could easily snow like a bitch and March, right?

Speaker 3:          00:26:06       Yeah. Oh yeah. It's risky. In March,

Speaker 4:          00:26:09       remember that time back when you were making the videos were that one dude was. He took his shirt off and you made a video about it. Like he took his shirt off in the audience, dancing around. Remember that guy who was hammered and then he gave me a big hug and then he was so ridiculously hammered and then after the show we found them in the parking lot, blood all over his face, no shirt on, somebody beat the shit out of him and it was like zero degrees out or like, wow, hey, take care buddy. Get in the car. Like that's a fucking normal Friday night for that dude would probably totally

Speaker 3:          00:26:45       as they're telling you the story, they pulled the 2000 fucking hit me with a bat. Oh fuck, fuck. He ain't, you got any ice on your extra batteries? Extra jacket. What the Fuck Guy? I'll tell you what that show Friday night that we did was uh, I was a nice place. I had never been the joint. Yeah, that was great. To join the audience was amazing. You know, the audiences we've been getting lately, it's just off the charts. They're so happy. It's like such a friendly, happy group. Like overwhelmingly. It's amazing. I don't know how we ever pulled it off, but it's amazing. And the joint was probably one of the best ones yet. It's one of the best crowds ever. It was amazing. It was just. Everybody's so fine with that bar was great. Great time. Joey and I went to that center bar and uh, we held court for like three hours, three hours just hanging around talking to people, you know.

Speaker 3:          00:27:42       We uh, Max are. He got too drunk to see Max drunk Max everly, Asians, Asian Jersey girl. She was half Asian, half Irish. He was torturing her. Well, he'll torture your mom. Foster with Jack. He's done. He's a great guy. That was zooming over. Yeah. We had an awesome time. It was, it was, uh, it was, you know what, it was like a, there was a lot of good vibes. Nice. I took the limo over to the fucking South Pole. You did another show after that 30. That was j dot Davis was there. Jason Rouse was there. And what's the light show, bro? It was mind boggling, like thinking of doing the weekend. They're like, oh my calling in August and go give me the 1230 at 1230. Wow. It was good. It was in a way is what's going on that all these comics work like bobby columns is that right?

Speaker 3:          00:28:36       Becomes 10. Some other girl did 10. It was smooth and so there's like a bunch of real common. Oh my God, there had to be 2:50, one to 50 and what was the locals and lose what they were telling me, like people coming back with drinks like people felt. Let me tell you something. I went over there and had to be 150 people from the joint show. No showed up with tickets for me to sign, but we told them you were going to go going, listen man, this is fucking amazing. I just got for cocktails made $17. It didn't. We announced it on stage that you did. Was drinking something? Something was going on. I didn't know. I didn't know for sure. People like, Hey, you going to be at the south point yet? Went over that Cj, Jay Davis. She got a bunch of comics I hadn't seen that. Just hang out and drink it. Well, we should do that when we're in town, like in between every Friday, every Friday at 1237.

Speaker 2:          00:29:26       I don't know where it was asking if you guys are going to go stop by because they, I guess they had a show at the other club at the hard rock the same night. A vinyl at the other hard rock or Illinois and diced dyson. Yeah, that's hilarious though. So they were in the same places us and they seeing if you want it to

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       before or after. I think it was before, but he was apparently his son was playing. He wanted us to come watch the son's band after my show. But you, we, you know, we got mobbed by people and it was, we had a, you know, Justin was with us so it's friends. So um, he's there like every weekend, right. I think for awhile or something like that. Both Amazing Papa bicycling many comics with them. Like a lot of guys came up and say hello to Joe. Come on guys. I recognize I didn't, I didn't know their names. Well, you know what, if Vegas was was really smoothly run, there would be a real comedy scene there. I mean it doesn't make sense. It wouldn't be. You're dealing with all these tourists that are coming in from out of town on a regular basis. It doesn't have to be on the strip.

Speaker 4:          00:30:26       If you have one good spot, like think of like that steak joint, that Brazilian place. We go to Texas de Brazil with the True House Korea. That's nowhere near the strip. It's way the fuck out there. It's somewhere in another, you know, part of it's not near the casinos but everybody goes there. Everybody goes there because it's good because they know it's there and it's good. And you know, there's people in town in Vegas that are always looking to do something. I know the casinos would like to keep the shows in the casinos and it's great to do the joint man. We had a. That was perfect for us. But like for like the local comics, like there should be a few comedy clubs in Vegas. It seems like you could have like a real local scene in vegas. I can't believe this is embarrassing. This is. I hate to say this because people didn't pick up.

Speaker 4:          00:31:09       We walked past bread. It's like we ain't going to break down. Nobody goes. We're not going because they don't know. No, I shouldn't say that because not Dunkin does. And he likes it. Yeah, that's why. But it's like they'll never quite. I don't wiggle. It was because we're too dirty. Is that what it is? I don't know. I think that he just likes a certain style and you know, I think Adam Hunter did it and he liked it. He asked me, but you know, when I see it I'm like, oh, I never even thinking. I always assumed that I'm to do. And then the La Dee la comedy club hit me up when I was in Vegas and if we wanted to go over there late at night and do a spot. You know the La Comedy Club? It's at bally's I guess. So there is a few comments. A lot of them have like would they have like Roseanne Barr there every, every Roseanne bought it.

Speaker 4:          00:31:54       Okay. Let me ask you this, how does that work? How does someone do like the same town every night, like five, six nights a week? Vegas for years. It shows up on Monday we had to have new people, new people, but how do you not go crazy because it's fucking vegas and has the hottest shit going on all day. It's like the best party, you know? Yeah. Yeah. But let me talk some best food. Sweetie Pie. If you lived there, it's very likely you might lose your mind. Vegas has God. There's A. There's a void in that town. You know, there's a lot of good people that live in Vegas and there's a lot of fun in Vegas, but this is the devil lives in Vegas, you know, he does. We all know he does it. If you live there, if you were there, you lived there. Woo. I don't know. Brian has the baddest bitches. Listen, I'm 50 years. A lot

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       of fun in Vegas. She is. I'm still alive. I might want to go to Vegas. You know, you get older. You do. You want to do Monday through Saturday? First of all, I wouldn't stay in the casino, Joel. Of course I live 45 minutes. I would not be my life at all, but like when I heard Roseanne Barr, she's doing. Yeah. She lives in Vegas now. No, I guess you commute to stays. I don't know what to day a week. She does the whole week. Virginia Masada, the whole week Monday crew. She does the 8:00 show. Then one clocks on a lineup comes in and they do it. So a lot of people like that do just change it to 10. You know. Bobby couldn't make it work. It takes a certain comment to make it work. The hotel has to get behind you. They just say what it used to be dog.

Speaker 3:          00:33:21       It's not like I read an article at the UFC brings how much money per weekend when there's a vegas and went to a million dollars. I wrote a management and it's like, wow. Yeah, I see it. I see the fucking concessions. You the cheerleading competition from Ogallala, Nebraska and that type of stuff. This is the new website. Yeah. That's one of the reasons why it's so disgusting that it's illegal in New York because they would make so much money from having a UFC there. It would generate so much revenue for the city. It would be fantastic and the fact that these dirty unions have kept it out for for that long. It's really kind of tackle UFC at Madison Square Garden. Just close your fucking eyes for five fucking minutes on my palms. First we get a steak with lobster on it or some shit. A lobster fucking bisque. How Salad we shoot over.

Speaker 3:          00:34:06       Are you kidding me? A wedge from Brooklyn. We get out of that motherfucking UFC 11:00 because the UFC ends at one and we'd be walking out of the garden. That one fucking 30. It's like walking into your oyster oyster of life. You know how everything is open. You get everything. You get Chinese cube and you get to county in the Bronx, you get fucking school, Geo Salad. You can get whatever the fuck you want at 1:30 in the morning. We don't have to go get a state. We'd go to China town. We've got a really a clam sauce. How many spots are there in la where you could pull that off? There's one in the morning. It was a few of the standard Dantanna's Dan. Dan, Dan is open till two Dantanna's up until two. They serve two to believe they do. That's a pretty sure I got a stake there and no one night after the comedy store it really late and it was God damn delicious.

Speaker 3:          00:34:50       Delicious with the side of stuff. So good googling Dantanna's just like one of those legit old school restaurants from the East Coast that exists in California somehow or another, and it's just very few places like that. I'm going to tell you where they're going to Micah Boulevard. It's sensational. Oh my God. I just was at the spot a couple of weeks ago. One of my favorite clubs in the country, the San Jose Improv, and it's a lovely place. It's down the block from the hotel. Everything's Joe. You got motherfuckers tell us for lunch and you go in there. You get the house salad with the spaghetti meat. I can't even eat the meat bones saucers no more because I get so scared. I just get the fucking regular rat Gustavo's now. No bread, no butter. And the house salad, they took a fucking hell of a steak too. They got a char grill grill. Charcoal Grill.

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       They use real wood charcoal. They don't fuck around with those fucking Tuxedos. Original Joe's is 80 motherfucking five. And the tablet really when you. Not that one. The tenderloin when never been to that one. Oh, this was good. I just broke down. They Jewish lightning that something happened with cap back open. Something happened. I don't know. I did San Francisco last week. I was in town. Tremendous. Tremendous food there. You loved that one girl. Every time we go, you take me to that Hillary Pasta. Columbia go nuts. Yeah. That cal zones. Columbus shows too. We filled it. And that's another, that's a legit place. Yeah. That's a legit place. There's another place down the street where it got that video of uh, uh, Tommy buttons. He was dancing. So was dancing to music and you came in. It was you, me mean secure. Remember that?

Speaker 2:          00:36:29       What's that Asian place? So that we go to that?

Speaker 4:          00:36:31       Yeah, with denny. Yeah, that's a, well it's Kinda like a sketchy area where we went outside. We had some Asian food after the show and uh, as we left, we went outside the door and they had a aquarium drive by, filled with strippers. Let's remember that we got a video of the truck. It's on youtube somewhere. Um, this, this truck pulled up. We were like, this is the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life. And the cops would pull up aside and me hit the lights, tell everybody, sit down, sit down. Because they're only allowed to dance when the, when the truck's not moving. So they had seat belts they would have to wear. So it's like a pole and just like some seats and like little tiny seats with seat belts. And the fucking cops would pull up and hit the lights, go a pseudo this girls dancing on a pole on the back of a fucking man.

Speaker 4:          00:37:18       And all I could think of was imagining life from their eyes. You're, you're naked and you're just driving around like bait, like you're like, like they're chumming, they're chumming the whole city to try to get them into this club and they're doing it by putting bait in a box. Like that's what people had been reduced to like a woman in the smallest amount of clothes legally possible with ridiculous shoes that, you know, she can't run good end and she's dancing around on a poll asking you to come with her. It's crazy. It's ridiculous. Fucking fish tank full of checks.

Speaker 2:          00:37:58       Oh yeah. I went to the playboy mansion and I got to see all his rare birds and they have like, he has, he's like the largest collector of rare birds ever. Really? Yeah. And, and you walk in, I don't know if it's the number one, but maybe in California or whatever, whatever, but when you walk in, there's these birds there that don't even look like real birds. Like I was saying, thinking like, I haven't even seen that before, like in a book or a magazine or on TV. So when you saw it in person, it just seemed like it was fake. It was so awesome. He has the coolest animals, like monkeys, collections that I've ever seen. Here's these monkeys that look like old men that just come up and to go out and have these beards and like these mustache and look like, like, like Samurais freak you out that they are locked in a little cage?

Speaker 2:          00:38:41       No, because they're humongous cages. Like, like it was like having a cage be like the size of like a football field. How many acres is that dude have out. It was a lot because I got like the full tour. Like most times you go to the playboy mansion, you have like, look, they're sectioned off and you're like at a small piece of it. I was there with friends with a family. The girl I was with, her mom was married to hue in the seventies and so she's just like, let me show you around. So, so I got to go. I don't even think I saw it all. I mean I walk for long periods of times on these paths where they would have like these little benches, like blowjobs stations and then go for another mile down. Imagine that place would be expensive as fuck to keep up. He had a staff about 100, 200 people there too. All the time. I don't know. One hundred, 200 people. There's a lot of people. Imagine you had to pay 100 people and it's to run your house. Yeah, that's amazing. That's craziness.

Speaker 3:          00:39:36       Joan rivers of some shit like that. I don't know. Joel Rubin, you know at the end of the day, that place to calmly store, they should just pick those places up and put them together so people could see that for centuries when the world ends. Is it because that's one of the most interesting places in the world. Flood Disneyland would fucking rides and Mickey mouse to mention how many Cox were really sucked there. How many dreams were broken there? How many women left there going, I'm done. You know what I'm saying? Like I just sucked at 11 cops. I got crabs, I got chlamydia, I'm done. And he didn't put me in the magazine. I think of what really happened in that because that's completely different than being on the east coast. That's, that's a fucking of broken dreams,

Speaker 2:          00:40:18       you know, it was the coolest thing was how many older playmates were there? They were the coolest girls in the road. Like I was sitting in the game room smoking weed on the. I mean, I don't know if I should say there was a room that the floor's made out of a, like a mattress. So like you walk in and suddenly your feet feel weird. Like what are you wearing? Shoes. Yeah, yeah. Great Staff. Right? I know it's fucking to get staff with the carpets just doesn't, it looks like carpet, but it's actually a mattress so, so you just sit down anyways. But there was like these ladies that would come out of nowhere and there were beautiful, the most beautiful cougars out, I would say 45, 48 and they would just come up with like, hey guys, how's it going? Mind if I join you and you're just like, that's the coolest shit. Hot Chick like that part of their uh, their occupation to sort of mingle and. Well it was July fourth. So I think it was more of just like all the family arguing, bobby

Speaker 3:          00:41:16       betting, all those chips were playmates, bro. What's. She really wasn't the. But I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Is she still doing comedy? No. Barbi Benton from the center of the Brunette when we were kids. How am I thinking of a Barbie with the vein of the tech from the comedy store that used to do that. We'd room. I'm fucking Vermont. That bobby doesn't have the yellow car. Is that what the yellow mercy she had taken over. But they put the vein from a bicep right in her tit instead of a tattoo. This bitch had a big Ole yogurt vein like, fuck, getting crunches, crunches butterflies all after on the machine. Whatever the fuck it is.

Speaker 3:          00:41:58       I kept on thinking I was going to see Felicia Michael's. It was like a bunch of Felicia. Felicia go there. No, I don't think she goes. I think she's been there. The part like for parties, like all of us. How's she doing? She does. She's doing whatever. Don't know. She was a funny check man. Yeah, they were all. Everybody's doing good. But that place, that place is very interesting. Like I went there with a complete different, like I did the comedy for time, like estate years ago on Fridays and I go and hang out and some of it I can't lie to you. It's not my cup of tea, you know, it's not going to suck my dick or you're not, you're not gonna walk around naked and talk to me like that, you know what I'm saying? But these, these savages where you know, and it was just peep when you're looking at them and you feel bad, but they're having a great time and they have like, people come up there with the illusion that they gotta meet playmates, right? Like they had guys on this shit. Polyester suits, three piece, the shoes. It's really, it was weird. But when you look at that place, you go, what really went on in that? Well, what's interesting to me,

Speaker 4:          00:43:01       it is a, if I think about it, the playboy mansion, is that it's sort of like the last sort of house like that have a however it's not going to exist anymore. I think it's gonna be a museum because when I was walking through I felt very like I could see this being a chippy kinda. Yeah, you cannot. Then that's not disrespectful at all. I think that no one, I mean maybe someone could do something like that in the future where they could create like a whole destination, but that's a destination. It's not just a house, it's not just the business. Like it would be like, oh, there's the strikeforce fights this weekend at the playboy mansion. Like they had fights there. We went to watch fight there. You know, they had a, they had more than one mixed martial arts event. They're having kids though and his sons and I think they're going to take over. I mean, hey look like young versions of him. Like I could see them just stepping in and being like, fucking pimps. Well they haven't makes sense. He would groom them. You know, why wouldn't you want to keep that business in the family? It's a iconic name. You know? It's like you can't go wrong with good management with a whole playboy thing.

Speaker 3:          00:44:03       The craziest thing, just licensing those tattoos. When I lived in boulder, there was a girl in boulder who was a limo in boulder at all times. That's at number one on it and it was a white stretch limo and a black driver and the chick was blonde and her claim to fame was that she was doing it real. She went to the University of Colorado. He drove every winter fucking limo. Wow. A half one limo, f one limo and in a bunch of coke. She did not. That's what I mean. How many people I know. I know. Like James Caan was associated like I watched that movie was on about a month ago. That stupid movie. Twenty one. What was that movie that the girl got killed? Eric Roberts played the creepy boyfriend. Oh No, no, no, no. I'm sorry. Let's see. Come on. Come on guys. What the fuck? She was the playmate.

Speaker 3:          00:44:52       Nineteen 81. Sharon. I know Eric Roberts. Killer. They did 19 what? Nineteen. Whether she was the playmate ladies. Jesus Christ. Your fucking stupid. It was a movie with Eric Roberts was creepy as fuck and he plays a boyfriend. He discovers her in Canada, brings it to Marisa. She's like 15 strange. When you see a guy like Eric, Eric Roberts that you see them, he starts out Poba, Greenwich Village. She's in this fucking unbelievable movie with Mickey Rourke. I could just still to this day holds up. Then one day he's on celebrity rehab in between. It's like some karate movies and shit and you know, for whatever reason, like he vanishes and then has to come back. That's his daughter that's blowing up right now. Who just got his daughter. That's the chicken is an actress. Yeah. The daughter was the daughter on a star rating right there? Yeah. Wow. I don't even believe I've seen this movie.

Speaker 3:          00:45:52       He was creepy at the end of the fucking gets these benches. He was making weightlifting equipment, but you also the real business where he was, he was making sex equipment and she takes her over there. He sits it down. He fucking ties are you rips her legs up. I mean he just destroyed it though. He was. He was a creepy mother five, and he shot himself. Fuck them. You know in the movie? Yeah. He saw two dudes. They did two movies that star ready with this broad and they did a different one with the guy from the general hospital. Now the older guy that I married on June, do you remember when they cut his thumb off public? We're going to take my thumb. Chocolate Gum, my dog. But he's shown the monologue. What he says to Mickey Rourke when he goes, what happened? Here you go. She left me.

Speaker 3:          00:46:38       Go what? And he goes, what's wrong with you? He goes, you don't have to remember. He just breaks it down and go. Sometimes they try to embarrass you and you've got a backhand them and you look into the face and tell them, you don't look at nobody. You don't say good night to nobody. That whole little monologue at that again was excellent. Excellent. He was a really, really good actor. That's why it's weird when you see him like one day and that crazy karate movie. Remember that Shit I just played in karate. Masters backfires too. As satisfying as you ready for this. I just saw them motherfucking audition about eight weeks ago. Really understand for what additionally for Costar like me. All right, so that's how. It doesn't make any sense. I just, I don't understand. How does a guy who's that talented and he was in that Sylvester stallone movie recently? Um, he was in the first one. What is the one with Randy coture the expendables? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       Yeah, yeah. He was in. That wasn't. He wasn't. Yeah, I'm pretty sure he was the bad guy. He was fucking excellent guy. Can Act as Asada and insisted on them. He says, I know that when he was, when they were doing, you know who his daughter is, the chicken blow the little girl in blow. What's the movie? Love with that little girl. And then she went out to be a Disney star. She's a Disney store. Look at Rob Redman. She's like some Disney check. But supposedly when they shoot at the studios they have security that he can't come on the set. And she's Julia Roberts. Nice. So Julia Roberts really like fucking with security on him and stuff because she, they try to keep her away from him. I don't know the whole story. I'm just telling you what I heard second hand when she shoots movies or TV shows.

Speaker 4:          00:48:16       There's something going on there. I don't know exactly what the fuck the thing is. She's really cute kid. She was a cute girl and blow that. He tells you he's going to meet her at the end. The whole thing. Well when he was on celebrity rehab it was very strange. It just didn't make any sense that he was there. Like it seemed like he just needed a break and didn't really enjoy Robert's Emma Roberts. I'm Roberts. She's real cute. Right? Young girl has got to be safe. Whenever someone going to rehab for re we'd. They're really almost need like a behavior or break the need. Like you know, you go into Rehab for life, you're off the rails for everything. And he said, you know, if you really, if you go into a rehab for weed, it's like a. He just need to go somewhere. Do you think there's certain cases that you could see going to rehab her way, like people like, you know, like went, Ralphie may used to be at his prime where he'd be like, seriously smoking, like two pounds of weed a day or something.

Speaker 4:          00:49:10       He's a perfect example, you know, and no disrespect to Ralphie but look at them. Yeah. And so that's obviously a very impulsive person and that's where I think that it's probably, you're not dealing with just the wheat itself, dealing with life in general. Like there's this look, we're all impulsive standup comedians and some most impulsive people to something about the type of person that thinks to say the, some of the shit that we say like the way your brain works this word. It's almost like an instinct for us to just be wacky. You know, it's, it's, uh, so when you get a guy that like is a standup comedian and then you find out he's a gambling addict, it's never a shock. It's never a shock when they're, you know, you find out they're blowing all their money, betting on sports, like it's normal Mcdonald's or blow all their money on for years.

Speaker 4:          00:49:59       But for me, how about I locked myself in my house and I played quake for 12 hours a day. I'm a fucking idiot, you know, it's the same thing. It's like we get impulsive, we have this like almost uncontrollable desire. I wouldn't be sitting around. I was like, I would be sitting around doing something else and all I could think of was getting back to my computer. I'm like, I just want to get online and play some quake and everything will be okay. Loaded myself up with caffeine and why? Because it's crazy. It's part of being a comedian, you know? So I, I, I kind of understand comedians being caught up in almost any like, nutty impulse like that, but you know, marijuana really going to go to rehab for that. You're going to rehab for lifestyle. That's what you do in life itself is just too slippery right now and need a break, which is understandable.

Speaker 4:          00:50:43       You know, I need to go to Rehab for Jack Daniels. I think she really. How often you've been drinking? No, I mean, I mean not for drinking in general, but like I, I try not to drink Jack Daniels now and it's like I miss it so much. It's so hard not to do. I've never drink Jack Daniels my whole entire life except for like the last, what? Seven months. Coincidentally the last year of your life, you've been balling out of control. You're going out layers, scared style son. You'll listen to this sweet home, Alabama. You of drives off the cliff. And what's the number? Seven meaning the Jack Daniels? The lucky seven or some shit like that. It says this is like old number seven. I don't know. It's probably like their seventh version of it that they made. If I had to guess, let's find out. Jack Daniels, old number seven ingredients gamble for about four months.

Speaker 4:          00:51:30       I knew it wasn't me. Yeah, I, I can't. I can't glorify months. And I was like, fuck you. I don't trust myself. I'm going to give my money to some fucking Dinah Thursday at 5:00, over five fucking dudes shooting a hoop. That is not happening the rest of my fucking life or baseball or basketball or anything that was. I love going like Santa Anita Park and Pasadena. I take $40 with me. I go and get a hotdog. I got a powdered beer once. The $40 is good. I get in my fucking car and I go home. You just say a powdered powdered beer. Really? So I. They think they saw you fucking draft beer. That's why I got a fucking headache for three days. He was a football game where you have see a vet, you drink three beers, went to the fucking headache. You get the next day. Yeah. You know it's pounded fucking bit.

Speaker 4:          00:52:20       Yeah. That was real. How cool would that be? Having powder beards. Powdered bit. I'm telling you, this is a weird thing. This Jack Daniels thing, because apparently the old number seven is the original recipe. I don't get it. Why would they call number seven? It says old number seven. Known ingredients. Also known as black label. This is the original Jack Daniels. Oh, you know what it is because there's a bunch of different jacks. One, two, three, four, five, six, six different tracks. There's silver select green label, Tennessee honey, single barrel gentleman, Jack. I like that. And old number seven. Six. Chuck Liddell's. Everybody. That's the right one. Weekly that I don't fuck with none of those cock suckers. They'll fuck you up. And you believed that Bro. I really have not drank. Jack Daniels was New Year's Eve. Nineteen 80. Well, it got a big bottle in the other room. Boy, I had some of it.

Speaker 4:          00:53:17       Um, uh, this weekend. Friday night. Delicious. Yeah, I joined. It was in a can of coke. You're fucking taking me for a rough tell you Joey Diaz. I do some of our best comedy sets when I have a little Jack Daniels and my sister. I'm not bullshitting. Even smell like Vegas. Fucking smell it though. Vegas. Friday night I had like three, three shots before I went on stage. He brought the bottle back there. I see that there was lightened. You motherfuckers drinking. Those are diet cokes. Listen, I could smell them in the year. That crowd though was so fun. It was fun. It was so much good stuff in the air at that, at that show. That was such a positive show, man. I was a great show and the people that came, I listened, man that you have the expo. If I wouldn't have fucked up my ankle, I would have gone and walked around.

Speaker 4:          00:53:58       You were limping a little bit. Yeah. I'm good now. The next. That was good. Something that morning I twisted something with these fucking adidas tops. No more than fucking hurt, but the next day I was fine, but I would have gone. What a great little thing. It's a great little show. You get to meet. You can roll with people. You pay $10,000. You could roll with fucking Frank Mir. They have seminars. They had all said the same time we're teaching things. Yeah, I've. I think it's beautiful. When did you, when you were a kid, you didn't get to play football against everybody. Yeah, and you never got to talk to you, you know, q and a's with Ronda Rousey Twain's. It's a great fun. You after your q and a, did you hang and talk to the people you went to eat as much as I could. They had a, I was doing this thing for the 20 year reunion of a or the 20 year anniversary of the UFC.

Speaker 4:          00:54:45       There's a documentary they're doing. So they had rushed me up to this, a studio that they had set up where they interviewed me for like an hour before the weigh ins. Then we had to rush back to uh, because I had an mc the way ends and they did the lands. The fucking wins were in the arena. It was insane. The winds were in the Mandalay bay convention center and it was fucking Gi Gan tick. It was, uh, the event center, Mandalay Bay events center where they usually do the USA. So the way ins where I know it was like 10,000 people at the weigh ins and when Anderson Silva and Weidman gone onstage, they went not like you could feel this crazy electricity in the air, you know. And there was all these Brazilians that were bullying when Wyman came out. And all these people were cheering for Anderson and you hear all these accolades, you know, you hear everybody call him the including me, especially me calling him the greatest fighter in the history of the sport.

Speaker 4:          00:55:39       And how long was that kits for it. And like couple of minutes, second or two, you know, just anderson like walked up to him and uh, Weidman walked up closer to Anderson and Anderson walked closer to him and then they were face to face and neither one of them budge. So they just touched faces. And then Weidman, as they backed away, Wyman goes, I'm not scared of you, man. I'm not scared of you. And they understand. Goes tomorrow night, see you tomorrow night. He goes, I'm not scared of you. He wasn't scared of a man. He really wasn't. And that was the difference on Saturday night. He really wasn't scared of him. He knocked him the fuck out. It's crazy. It was crazy to watch like Anderson fucked around like he normally does and like he eat more so than he normally does. He humiliates guys with that.

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       It's a, it's a real tactic, but you got to absolutely know what your opponent can and can't do. I mean maybe he could've gotten away with that with like a lesser guy or a guy who's like easily be fuddled, but one of the things they didn't Weidman's campus, they had people imitate that. They had people like taunt him. They had people spar with him and like pretend they were falling down and dropping their hands and poking their face out and juking them and poc shot and them and shit and doing all this stuff that Anderson always does because he gets you in, in a, like a defensive shell. He gets you frozen up because he moves really fast and one of his tactics, his, he will talk you a little bit and then blast on you. He'll blast on you can, he can, he could cover distance like deceptively fast.

Speaker 4:          00:57:09       So he's really good at closing the distance and crack and dudes and sometimes he can knock them out and sometimes like the Vito Belfort shot or sometimes he just lights you up like the first. A few exchanges with Chris liebing, you know, just lit him up, lift him up, lift him up again before you eventually stopped him. I mean ashland is a fucking tremendous talent, but that dropping of the hands, you'll leave yourself so vulnerable that even a tremendous talent like him can get knocked the fuck out, and that's one of the big lessons of Saturday night. The big lesson is everybody's vulnerable. Even the best guys are human beings and a human being as vulnerable. The whole ideas and not get hit and it doesn't matter who the human being is. If their skill levels really high, it doesn't prevent them from being damaged by a solid punch.

Speaker 4:          00:57:59       Everybody gets fucked up by a solid shot. Everybody who gets kicked in the head goes to sleep. You get, we'll kicked in the head. You go night night. It happens to everybody. It happens to the best people in the world and that was like a big lesson. Saturday night, the auditory beer really just shut the fuck up. Didn't. It was weird because the room I was in stopped. It was weird. Stopped. Yeah. I just stopped and it was a, you know what, it's good for everybody now. Now they start from scratch again. This is going to be interesting whether they're trying to set up the rematch. Um, for the, the word is online for um, the new year's show which is December 28th, which would be guess Matt Desk Job Ideas. Do you know what kind of hype and I guarantee you in a rematch. Anderson Silva is gonna dot his i's and cross his teeth first knockout though he's never been knocked out his entire career.

Speaker 4:          00:58:53       People usually get that after time they become, they become vulnerable and they become human beings. And not only that, the reality is if you get knocked out it's easier to get knocked out again. And who knows what's happened in training. I mean, who knows, he's sparring with like really high level guys and training on a regular basis. You know, he's probably with, with Machida, with Fazio, like there's a lot of those black house guys that are fucking bad ass beasts, you know, like who knows who's tagging him in the gym, especially when you're doing long, hard rounds. So everyone turns 38 at one point in their life and Anderson Silva's 38. So you have to think about that as well, but you don't want. When I was growing up it was 35, 35, but we both discussed this. Look at our board is 42. How about.

Speaker 4:          00:59:43       Yeah, how about Bernard? Hopkins is 43. That's what I was talking about I think. And this one's got three. Three more. Good, good. Good. Battles left. Oh, you know what? They are even more if he fight smart. Let me tell you something, man, before he got knocked out, he was looking lightning fast. He was slamming leg kicks in. He avoided being submitted. He got back up to his feet. He got out of a heel hook and got back up to his feet. It's not like Anderson looked bad, but what he did was he does what he does, that, that taunting thing. I mean, when he knocks the guy out because of it, it's awesome and it looks great, but when you get knocked out, man, it's like that commercial, you know, that nos commercial of the guy who does these flippy kicks and the other guy just blasted him on a change is called them and boom, that's um, there's, there's a reason why that's in a commercial.

Speaker 4:          01:00:34       That whole scene plays out in the commercial as sweet justice, like justice to the guy who taunts. And that's why the whole crowd was booing Anderson. They were booing. Anderson with Anderson got knocked out. I mean, that's, that's weird. It's, but it's a natural reaction that they had no one told them that they had to bu. But there was a lot of people booing. There was a tremendous amount of people booing the best fighter in history because he got caught. And I think that is fascinating. They, like, they felt, he let them down because he got knocked out doing something stupid and they're like, yeah, what did you do man booboo? Meanwhile, what happened to him? Man, I just lost the title. I mean, he made an ass load of money, but he just lost the title in devastating fashion and people have no empathy like big people.

Speaker 4:          01:01:29       Don't give a fuck. People don't get the cold realities of life. Yeah. That's whole mother fucking realities of life. God wants the envelope sales and the glamours gun. The part. Have you seen that? Unfortunately though. That sucks, man. That sucks. But that's a man. I saw it with my mother. I start with a thousand. So you would never do that? No. Why would, I mean you, if you were there in the audience and you saw it go down, you imagine home heartbroken. I wouldn't have. Boom. He's still the fuck I know what happened. I, yeah, as a fan, I'm fucked. You know what the fuck told you to fuck around? You know, I'm the same. I don't even like fucking around when I'm walking around. Brian, I don't even like fucking around. When you're walking around pay fucking attention. You go to an airport and you put your shit on line, the people in front of you and you're like, fucking attention.

Speaker 4:          01:02:13       Yes. Shit. But if you fucking do it and you pull it off, it's spectacular. When forrest griffin, when he fought fucking Damien Maia, if you live by the sword, you die by the fucking short. That's why it's called Karma. The fight before that I. that's the first time I watched the fight. I didn't want to end. Even if even if fucking frankie would have knocked raphael out Olivera, I would have said, listen, let them go again. Let them go six or seven rounds. That was a great fight. The fight before that was a great, great fight. It was a great night. It was a, it was one of the most exciting nights of fights ever. Every Jujitsu guy is lightened the fucking candles. Roger Gracie right now. I don't know what happened. Oh, expect that couldn't for whatever reason. Getting the uh, his MMA game is nothing like his Jujitsu game is off the chain.

Speaker 4:          01:03:05       He just go back to fighting in Jujitsu tournament span. It's like, it's a great fucking fights. How about Cub Swanson? Oh my God. Damn. Oh my God. That was insane. That was the best that kids ever looked. What was curious? He was insane. He tried to cartwheel care. No, he did it. He went to do an upper cut and he went from where he faked and he came up with an applicant. He did something very beautiful. Yeah, he was doing a lot of beautiful shit. He's really crafty, like he's very, very creative and unpredictable and he's like fake slow and kicks high. He does a lot of weird shit. You don't 65 brother? No, he's 45. He's 1:45. Yeah. That adds a complete different. Let's just, let's just put him up against the doodle wanting to fight Benson Henderson in Minneapolis. Let's do it. That's a hell of a fight, right?

Speaker 4:          01:03:52       Would it be a great. That's a fight right there. Well, I would like to see a rematch with him and Aldo because, you know, he fought Aldo and got caught with a flying knee, uh, like a double knee may, maybe like 10 seconds into the fight was very quick. All the although jumped up and nailed him on the forehead with a flying economy open and it was nasty, mean, you know, he didn't get a chance to get into the fight. He just got caught and I think that he's a way better fighter now than he was then. I think it'll be really interesting after watching him fight seaver like, God damn man, he didn't see her up. He lifts. Those combinations are insane because he was so accurate. Like the last combination that he knocked him out with, he hit him with like three or four ridiculously accurate shots.

Speaker 4:          01:04:31       While you know it's a lot of chaos going on and scrambling and scrambling after him and he's catching them on the jaw. That was a great fight. It was a lot of great fights, man. A lot of great fights. See people didn't give tim credit. Kennedy enough credit for that fight. Not even had his back. He took him down and had his back and was slamming him in the face. I was like, what the fuck is going on? It's getting punched. That's what's going on, man. Jujitsu is one thing, but Jujitsu with punches to the face by a guy who's a black belt in Jujitsu changes the whole game, like you might not be. He might be better than Tim Kennedy at straight Jujitsu if they had a regular Jujitsu match, but Kennedy's got a good enough to just say that he could hang, he can defend himself, like he's not scared to grapple with really high level guys any strong as shit, but Kennedy is also a boxer.

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       He can hit hard and when he gets it to the ground, he's got real mixed martial arts skills and it gets to the ground health thump. You with punches and so the guy like Andre is not really quite a complete mma fighter yet. He's just as brilliant Jujitsu guy who's entering into mma and there's guys like Kennedy out there. They'll, they'll, as long as they're hitting you in the face like you're not going to submit them. It's just a completely different ballgame. You're all dizzy and shit. Your face is puffy and you can't see it. You're right. I mean, that's the reality of getting punched in the face. It's, I don't like seeing it when guys like really good at Jujitsu and I see them come to mma and they're getting fucked up. It just, it kind of bothers me because I feel like, you know, they're not ready yet.

Speaker 4:          01:05:58       You should have, if you're going to really enter into mma, it has to be a long term proposition and you should look at it as like, what are your strength? Your strength is Jujitsu. Okay. What's your weakness? Your weakness is stand up. Well, you got to fix that. You've got to fix that first. You can't even think about getting in there unless you could fight in a kickboxing match because you're going to be going right away to some of the highest level guys. The world because you're hodrick racing. They take a guy like that and they don't like. They don't move them along slow, you know, he's gonna fight high level guys because of his name pretty quickly and because of his reputation in Jujitsu. Whereas the reality of his striking is he's the one that is striking a few years. You know you need many years on the books before you go and strike with a guy like the Leo Machida or something like that.

Speaker 4:          01:06:44       You just need a lot of years of the books. You have to get them because he's going to light you up. It's going to hit you with he's going to pot shot you and he's going to crack you and you're not going to stop him and he's going to hit you three or four times like that and he's gonna knock you out too. Sneaky game. The striking game striking game is a different game. Some guys can just adapt real quick. Like there's some Dan Henderson type dudes that like almost right away within a couple of years as dangerous as fuck, but some who's just never quite get the hang of it. Awesome. Got picked up instantly and you see it. You see what gets you guys are real. Jujitsu guy is striking is very slow. Sometimes it's a new saying, wow, is he in the octagon? But maybe they know something.

Speaker 4:          01:07:27       I don't remember. You went so side note something I thought. Yeah, well I think we're dealing with a new era of mixed martial arts. I don't think people are ever going to try. There's that, that um, although jump flying knee, watch this, boom. That's like the first exchange of the fight. He double flying knee them in the face. It was insane. Cut them, cut them real bad over his eyebrow. Look at that. Yeah, I mean, but that's one of those things where they're send me anybody who gets hit by that, that's a reality. And we, you know, a lot of great guys don't get hit like that, but if they did, that's what would happen. You know, it's, you can't avoid that. That was a big lesson. It's important lesson, Saturday night, important lesson for martial artist because people like to think that because the guy is really good that he can somehow or another magically take punishment better.

Speaker 4:          01:08:17       Not really. So it's a fucking lesson for everybody. Yeah. That's a lesson for everything in life. Karma is a motherfucker. You see it in April, you see it in basketball. Sometimes you'll see a team that's got a reputation, the fast break, and all of a sudden this team that nobody's talking about, the fast break through, they go into finals and the coaches say fast break breaking and the team that's been France breaking motherfuckers, they know how to execute, but they forget how to defend the fast break. They fucking lose. It happens all the time and the different types of sports in different situations. Man, the rematch is going to be absolutely fascinating to see what's going to happen. Then to rematch with Weidman. Anderson Silva will be the greatest worry match in the history of the UFC. No doubt about it, and everybody's going to want to know why men can do it again and everyone's going to want to know how Anderson going to recover. That's going to be fascinating as, fuck, man, whew. That's going to be crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:09:12       I can't write out a guy like Anderson Silva. I'm right there with you watching. Can't 17 fights and the three or two before that on Youtube, whatever. You can't write this guy off. You cannot write him off. But then, however, however we seen it with a lot of other fighters, age takes whatever the money, the children, you know, it's, it's a new wage. I can't wait to see today I saw a picture of this gift to Sin Against Jon Jones, the fucking, uh, the whatever. Look at that fight. Those are two monsters. Monsters. Yeah. Well, you know, and one of the things about a guy like Anderson, we're comparing them to a guy like Bernard Hopkins, just 10 years older than him. Watch out Bernard fights. Bernard Hopkins is a brilliant defensive fighter. Brilliant. You very rarely see Bernard Hopkins Kit clipped, you know, and when he gets clipped, his boxing is good enough that he knows how to go into a shell.

Speaker 4:          01:10:01       He knows how to move. He knows how to give you angles and he gets away with Shit. He's got a good channel and he gets away with Shit. And one of the reasons why it's got a good chin as he hasn't taken a beating ever. He's never taken a beating his entire career. You know Bernard Hopkins, like he kept a skills pass any of the fighters of his prime. I think about his fight with Roy Jones, Jr Acumen. Roy Jones Jr. They duked it out once and roy beat him, but when they do to the second time, bernard hopkins basically just like box box box them up because bernard's skills hadn't deteriorated like roy's reflexes. Like roy's skills were so reflex based. He was so speed and reflex based, in my opinion. He was The scariest boxer that you would ever have to compete against. I mean, Mike Tyson was ferocious and terrifying, so I shouldn't say he was man.

Speaker 4:          01:10:51       It was close cbc, obviously. I was actually a line in an a nas song. This is welcome to the new world. The new mike tyson's Roy Jones. That was [inaudible]. Roy jones was just knocking everyone silly. He didn't do it the same way that tyson did. He did it with just like speed and ridiculous combinations and insane accuracy. He could just move in a way that other dudes couldn't move. Like if you go back and watch his highlight Reels, god damn, he was amazing. But he fought like this weird style with your hands down and he didn't throw a lot of jabs. He threw like a leaping left hook, but he was so fast with it. He would just catch guys on a chin and he would light them up with it. He threw a lot of lead, right hands. He had like a different style and his style was based on his ability to cover ground and his accuracy.

Speaker 4:          01:11:40       And as soon as they started getting older and starting getting hit and slowed down, that style was like and now actually a detriment. And so he stopped being offensive. Like one of the most disheartening things about watching Roy Jones jr fight now. It's not that he's still fighting, is that he's not hurting anybody. Like can you watch him fight? He's, he's. He has to be much more defensive. He's been knocked out a few times now. So now it's like his boxing is almost like he's boxing, she's trying to win, but he's also trying to knock it knocked out. How old is he though? I believe he's 40 of does. He owes money. Yeah. He wants to get an mma, that's what the word is. there was an article about some tax issues and some, you know, I would imagine that he thinks that there's some good money for them and mma and even at his age, all the fights that he's Been in and the toll that that takes on your body, his boxing skills are so far and above tHe average mma fighter that it would be kind of interesting.

Speaker 4:          01:12:39       Especially if you give a guy like Roy Jones jr, little tiny gloves. Think how fast he has his regular gloves. You know, I mean imagine give manny pacquiao, little mma gloves and imagine how quick he's punching you in the face and could you even see it coming? I mean, how do you stop that? It was like four ounces on them as opposed to the, what is it, six or eight he's wearing regular basis. That's a big difference man. Those little tiny knuckle gloves as a big difference. If a guy like manny pacquiao got an mma, teach them how to teach them some butterfly guard, how sprawl, how to get back to your feet. It's work with them on that for a couple of years and set them loose. Is many though. It's a good question. He's in his thirties, right? Go do six. Manny pacquiao.

Speaker 2:          01:13:31       How old is manolo packy owl?

Speaker 4:          01:13:33       Yeah. Don't be a dick.

Speaker 2:          01:13:35       Right? Would you like me to search the web for searching the web for? How old is he?

Speaker 4:          01:13:43       Fuck, fuck.

Speaker 2:          01:13:45       He was born December 17th. He's 34,

Speaker 4:          01:13:49       man. No, he's not. No, he's not. Not in the world of boxing. The world of boxing is a different world. There's only a few. Bernard hopkins is a matter of fact. He's the only one that I can even think of. There's no one else that's managed to keep their career going that deep into their forties. No one in the world of boxing dirty for saying is he hasn't taken a lot of. Yes, he has. He's been in some wars and that last knockout, that one walmart has knocked out. That's a career changer. It's a career change because he ran into a telephone pole right hand. I mean literally ran into it, so it was him moving forward really fast and mark has catching them on the button and they had two wars before that where they dropped each other. So those guys have had, he's gone through those fights and then the fight, he lost his bradley.

Speaker 4:          01:14:37       There wasn't a war, but it was a tough fight, you know. But if you go like back to like some of his, uh, his fights before then, you know, he, he'd been in some crazy fights. I mean, even though he still winning and looking spectacular, you know, there, there's some wild exchanges ready for. Yeah. And you know, who knows, I mean there was also like rampant speculation of performance enhancing substances. I don't know if that's true or not, you know. And then there's always the question, are they, when, when fighters do those things, it's like, um, I think going to continue to do them, how are they going to like regulate it? How, how do they. Like when you hit really high peaks, like performance enhancing drug peaks, the real issue is if they are doing something illegal, how are they going to maintain that level and will they maintain that level?

Speaker 4:          01:15:29       It's an artificial level so it's like you're going to go ups and downs, you've got to take time off in between doing it and you gotta make sure you catch it right and sometimes they don't and when they don't, you know, you'll see like real ins consistencies and their performance. You see them when they looked absolutely sensational and then you see them when they're in this like little spot in between cycles. Who's not doing drugs? Can you please tell me it's a good question. Who's not doing drugs? It's a good question. I think a lot of fighters aren't doing drugs. I know bj penn, I don't say I know, but I'm pretty sure. I mean I don't think he would lie about that. That's part of his whole honor with the whole fight game. And john fitch I think is another one. I don't think john fitch has ever done anything.

Speaker 4:          01:16:06       I personally talked to them about it and he said he would never be able to live with himself if you know. He knew that he got there because he was doing something. He was using something that dude got really far with, just like fucking grittiness and toughness and will, you know, without any enhancement to his body artificial. But there's a lot of folks out there that do do it. I don't know how many you wouldn't know unless you're there with them is all speculation because some guys just have sensational genetics. Some guys are just, they're just unbelievably robust and the heel quik and they look great and you would swear that they're on something. But then on john shit, you know, which is part of the weird arguments because like not everybody is born. Like everybody says it's an even playing field, but it's not, you know, if you're fighting, you're fighting jon jones, five foot two. There's no evil even playing field. Oh, you both weighed two. Oh, five. Yeah, she'll be fine. There's not an even playing field. You're crazy. He has a super body. You can't even have a chance. It's not even, and there's nothing you can do by the way, you can take all the steroids in the world. You're never going to beat John Jones. He said the mechanical advantage of his frame and his athleticism, the average guy. It's never gonna be able to fuck with that.

Speaker 3:          01:17:19       Every actor over 50 right now in hollywood shooting fucking shit. Musicians on the, toward doing the 60 and 70.

Speaker 4:          01:17:26       Well, most of the guys I think used the cream. They use, uh, the, you see those, those cream ads, testosterone cream a little bit. This is going to be huge. There's a spray or an oral spray because it good. Yes. That's going to be the next one. Yes. Apparently the absorption rate is even better than I'm rubbing it on your skin. The transdermal method, it's better when you put it in your mouth. He spray like you give yourself a shot in the morning with cliq. You know, you're a mouthwash, do your mouthwash and then give yourself a shot of testosterone and you're off on your way to a cream. You have to rub all over your whole entire body or you rub it on your upper arms and shoulders. What if you just more your not with it. You could masturbate with it, I guess to help anything maybe, but what if you cleaned up and you accidentally cleaned up your test cream because you thought it was just you would waste some of your tests. Cream. I've been last year at dirty bastard. He's just not all of yourself and then pull your underwear over it and let it all cook liberal. All stu inside your your ball sack area. I've been masturbating with monistat once a week now because it keeps your pe or levels down your levels of what aid.

Speaker 2:          01:18:34       What is monistat first of all is that some women use for yeast infections? Yeah, absolutely. What is wrong with you? Because I found out that you can have guys have yeast infections and that's why if you have sex with a girl and she has a yeast infection, a lot of times you gave it to her because you have don't have usually any symptoms. So one of the things to get rid of that is put monistat on your dick and around your balls and around that shit at least once a month, but he's like every 20 minutes.

Speaker 3:          01:19:00       Here's the weirdest joe rogan 94. It was an open my comment that was getting divorced and I moved to New York and I would work in the city and that was on the coke and I had this in child support. I just couldn't make it all work. So part of my angle every morning I get a suit Before I went to work in the city, I go to fort lee amp right there by the George Washington bridge and they just finished stocking the shelves and I had a briefcase like a bookcase. I was a businessman in the city and I'd put monistat now in the cases and a monistat and there was something else they liked, like a. Not the little aspects but the big aspirins. I like walk over the George Washington bridge, take them to a bodega and that's all they would buy from you is yeast infection medication. That's what they tell you when you brought them. Shit. I keep bringing it. That's the most of them.

Speaker 2:          01:19:45       One thing up in spanish harlem, so I would walk over the bridge. I got like 60, 70 yeaRs. Any books

Speaker 4:          01:19:52       in those days? I was an open mic. I didn't give a fuck. I was just going over there just enough to have money to get a hot dog, a bag of weed and do whatever. That's how crazy they were. The guys would say, make sure it's the monistat. Bring the monistat seven. It says an amazing how much people identify with their. Because

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       there's a thing that women hate more than not want more than anything is left. I mean that's a massive generalization that has taught myself, but there's one thing that a lot of women really do not appreciate and that's stinky pussy jokes. You know, you could talk about your stinky feet, who can talk about a girl, stinky feet and talk about a girl's breath. You can talk about our girls, but you can't talk about a girl stinky pussy to them. You can lose a lot of people that don't like when you talk about even onstage really like, yes, yes, yes. I've seen someone do a stinky pussy joke and then I've seen women in the audience going, oh, come on. Just upset that you put that possibility out there. I've never smelled a bad fucking pussy. Like when people did a lot of coke. No, no, he knows that like I'm a fucking gets that.

Speaker 3:          01:20:58       If I pick up a chicken barn, she's great. I'm thinking I'm going to take, take a shower. It's not going to help. I just, it it help us. No, no, but I finger banged a girl in Idaho falls and indian and american indian I finger. She had those daisy dukes on triple one night is and I'm all warmed up. I got like $32. I got no blow budweiser. Fucking furious. I'm dancing on the edge. She's letting me touch her joe rogan and I stick my hand in like this way, like full finger. Oh my fucking twat. And I had that fucking yoga look at the size of his and I was bringing up this way. You know Bruce Lee, you know I was that. I stopped and I took it out to call them. I could. I was dancing with it. I could smell my hand and that was it.

Speaker 3:          01:21:49       I remember just fucking go do some sad moments and you can't get it off. Do you know that the smell of fish is actually from old come usually. So if it's a really strong a fish smelled, that means there's common inside of her. That's funny because that's what my is always smelled like. If I jerk off and don't wipe up, smells like fish. Don't realize I'm bethesda. I used to take up my own jazz. I shoot sheet and my pubes and pull my underwear. I, by the way, I've done that dozens of times in my life to just. Once I shoot of, I jerk off, I just shoot a load on my pubes. I don't even bother cleaning it up. I just pull my underwear up. I do that. Especially when I'm in the house. I'm like, as long as it's covered, what do I give a fuck?

Speaker 3:          01:22:29       If I'm in the hotel room by myself, I'll get cares who cares. Bandwidth on the bed and laid on it. I don't give a fuck all day. It's like, oh, this is my little tropical helmet juice, but that was the only time I really ever like. I dated a chick that one before I started dating. The chick was a little proof just when I was like 19, 20. I didn't know what to expect to have a pussy smell. Oh my goodness. She took care of it. What happened? No, that you took care of it. It was good. I wouLd sniff it and everything. Never sniffed nothing. It was delicious. I, I, I knew a giRl when I was young and had a problem. Did you say something to him? No, I did

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       not. I was too. I couldn't. I mean it was those back then when you know, when you're in your teenage years and you fooling around, you know what the hell you're doing. The last thing I'd do is start bringing things up. Did you keep eating it though? Oh no. There was none of that. No, there's none of that going on. She didn't want you to do that. She knew something was wrong, but it was just like, it was one of those things where I bet she was catholic girl. I better parents and talk to her about it. I bet she had no idea and I bet she thought that's just what they smelled like, you know, and it was, it was unfortunate. You know, she figured it out later though later in life, like while you up and told you no, no, no, I, I hooked up with her later when I was in like in my twenties, like once and I was like, oh, it's all cleaned up now.

Speaker 4:          01:23:47       Imagine if it still is a mess. Like longest running yeast infection ever. No one ever talked to her. It was just like always this thing that was never discussed. Some have a pre judge. If you judge a woman to go chick's pussy, stuff. Like sometimes I look at a woman, I got a guy with your pussy smell fucking horrible, you know, harassed. I can look at the chicken guy. Yeah. Pete harassed most. Seeing a girl that took a sloppy drunk with dirty feet. You got to imagine that something going on. I always go by weight usually because the bigger girls have a worst smell because they could be like trying to clean their pussy for like the last five years and was like the crack. Yeah, but I gave this italian skinny chick that had a little wine gum monkey when I was a kid.

Speaker 4:          01:24:24       I mean it didn't stop me from eating. She was skinny. She had to be like 90 pounds, but a pussy weighed 60. She was one of those checks and she was italian so it smelled like fucking. It was tremendous. Like melissa, by the way, because when you're in the citadel and salami, I'm the block from that fucking cuban joint. You turned me on tHat domingo's ain't bad. Huh? Is it after then I got the meatball sandwich. I could call him red salad. Where's that? Is it like a deli? But yeah, right up the block from fucking ventura. The mangoes. I went there the other day. Good restaurants on that street. Not a good restaurant. Oh. Somebody was telling me that I haven't been taught by my house, like studio sets were invented. Sushi. Is that true? No.

I don't think anybody does that, but yeah, the garden, all of our gardens. Food is frozen. Is it? I think so. I think. Come on. I think that what what the story is is that they get like, like things like almost like a frozen food where they just kind of follow it out on noodles like that. The whole thing is frozen. Get the fuck out of here. Do you can't say that unless you know for sure we can get tragically xapi or allegedly you gotta stop doing that. Dude. You're gonna. Get people sued. Google it.

I love that chicken. That domingo's is next to a buck law factory. Okay. I know exactly what it is and they fucking make. I mean, I've been hearing it from steve, so mom, the aiga stino they bring, you know, brought me a half a meatball sandwich and I was like, yeah, there's an episode of anthony bourdain's show where he goes to this spot in New York city that's been around since the 18 hundreds with the same family and they bring him over spaghetti with gravy and meatballs and so they call it great. Yeah. They call it gravy back then. It's like old style east coast italian and you look at the spaghetti's yellow and the sauces ready let ball and you're like, oh my god, it's red led. That's what kills you, but you've got to eat that at five and go for a walk. Read, lead, track realizes. You know, what do they put down? What do real good? He's put in that sauce.

I'm trying to do a special, so I'm trying to figure out what they're doing doing this between houston and denver, but if I do it in denver, I'm going to go close to where I did time.

I think it's, that's the place that I think I'm going to do my next special at a comedy club. Really? Yeah. I think I'm going to do my next one at the comedy works and then ran a bad idea. Yeah.

I want to calm me cup, but I heard that some comedy because you've got to give him 20 grand when you're saying you know when you're saying you would do it near where you got arrested. Like where was that? I got arrested in boulder so I could do the fox theater boulders. Great. I can do a bunch of stuff to boulder while school's in session. Are you fucking kidding me?

There are different BeCause they got to deal with an extreme climate and they all bond together. You know, like they were talking. one of the dudes that was working there was talking about jewel because jewel is from Alaska and apparently something happened once where she had to cancel a show and uh, then when she came back after she had

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       canceled, it was like really low attendance because people were disappointed or they don't forgive you for stuff like that. Like they think like you, you like you, you're a part of a community and if you cancel something, especially if you don't have like the best excuse ever, they get upset at you. I don't know. They said she's normal. That such as like a normal person. She's out there just, you know, everybody knows where houses no one. Nobody fucks with her. Just normal. Have you watched the liberace movie on hbo? I heard you were doing a bit about it on stage. I didn't hear it. I love that. I love really. It's so some people. It's to. For me, it's to see what I've seen growing up. Creepy old fags trying to pick up young fucking guys and doing it. and how he did it. Show how he did it, how he did it.

I'll tell you what he did. He, matt damon's character. He made them get plastic surgery to look like him. WaTch the fucking. That's hilarious. watch the fucking movie. You're gonna die. You're gonna die when he gets matt damon in side control with his dick in his mouth. Oh my. Who's up swallows that fucking sword. Listen to me. Watch the moon. Wasn't really that good because watched the movie though. That sounds like brokeback nights. It's not like brokeback mountain, but it's interesting to see, you know. Listen man, we've heard some fucked up shit living in hollywood. We've got a lot of stories. Yes. But you never heard of a motherfucker making another motherfucker do plastic surgery to look like look like him and then threw his ass out and gave him 75 grand.

Speaker 3:          01:33:35       Wow. So I found ouT the olive garden thing, I guess it used to be fresher back in the day. They used to make noodles out in the open so everyone could see it and stuff. But to cut cost they've kind of cut things. But. But it's, it's a lot of people were saying like, I always say the sauces are always frozen. Supposedly half the shit's frozen. Half of it's not just like every other restaurant. You don't get chicken rice. Well listen, if you want low prices, you've got to deal with that shit. So this liberace Movie, it's called behind the candelabra and when did it come out? It came out two months ago and I didn't watch it. I didn't know what it was and I got stuck watching him one nighT and I'm like, what the fuck? This is amazing. He was a veterinarian. Now this guy and how he got rid of the veterinarian, he got rid of the guy before him.

Speaker 3:          01:34:20       Like he just got rid of him and then he had a bunch of guys and all. He would just latch onto young guys and touch their leg. It was just really a. You got to just see the fuck. Well that's the thing with baltaR gay dudes, twinks. These guys were real old school fags, bro. He had a wig. you suck. That meant he was sucking without his wig on the wig off. I met damon who's this? And it goes, oh, it's the first time you saw me without a wig. And it's fucking Michael Douglas. Oh my god. You Just 20, 30 minutes. I'm watching that tonight. That's my favorite new movie and I haven't even seen it.

Speaker 3:          01:35:02       That might be my favorite movie and I haven't even seen know when I first got here, nine slash eight. The big thing was that book. You'll never work in this town again. Remember that hooker wrote a book and she had don henley and the book and charlie sheen, don henley would get five hookers. Tell him to bend over. They weren't even allowed to pop the head open. They will all in downward dog for hours. Nobody in that group of hookers had carpal tunnel syndrome. Do you understand me? He would make five hookers. Come over, put them in that way and I'm not trying to be cute. He'd do coke and walk around with a rope and put his dick in them twice. Take it up, walk over to the hookup, pump it twice and look at them and go put on hotel California. Sit down, do two more lines of code for viagara tip.

Speaker 3:          01:35:47       This is before viagra and this is, but now it was, but he asked him. He asked him liberace. He's like, how do you do it? How do you. How do you fucking do it? How do you, uh, how did you fuck me four times today. And so there's shit in there too. You can see liberace does the poppers and matt damon wants to sniff the poppers. So. Wow, this sounds like the best one we ever. Now, how does poppers make you get your dick? Hard as hell, bro. I don't know. The poppers was like a relaxed mother, papa type of guy. But in the gay community, I guess when you're fucking another guy in the muffler, you hit them with a papa and it keeps his dick hard. I don't know. I don't quote me on top. I was never into pop. What do they call it?

Speaker 3:          01:36:25       What's a little fucking thing? Nitrates. But one of the. What's the brand locker room? Whether it's the brand, the brand. The popper. Yeah. No, I've never taken it. I didn't know what a proper guy. One of his. But he's got him in his fucking house. That's his middle name of columbus. Fuck. This motherfucker was making sixth graders sniff that shit. Its proper speed. No, it's this joint. It's this drink. And what happened was, what time of the miami improv had a, had a condo across the street from it, the old miami and probably belong to one of the owners. It was where he put his mistresses issue this bit. But I think he bought the club, the club and I had the bed in the wall. I must've fucked 80 women that I used to tie him up there. I would tie them up and put coke rocks in their pussy and shit and they will all wake up tied up like jesus and you get that bed, you can still see like eight rope.

Speaker 3:          01:37:18       I always had to get new rope to tie him up. But one time I wasn't there and they called me like, where are you? I'm like, I'm in la. What's going on? They're like, well you have to condo two weeks ago. And I'm like, no. And they're like, because weber was there, left a mess and they left a thousand poppers. The type of mother I snort, coke dog. Don't confuse me with doing fucking poppers. And it was a little thing like this and you opened it and had locker in it. It's, it was a locker room or something. That's what it was called, which sniff it. And they get you high, like 60 seconds. Get the fuck that shit supposed to give you an instant brain average to give you age. I think. No, that was

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       what duesberg was claiming that that was a part of, uh, you know, I shouldn't even that, that was the most controversial podcast we ever do. The age podcast that we had. This guy peter duesberg and duesberg is a, he's a professor at the university of California berkeley. He's a biologist and he was the one that said that hiv doesn't cause aids. So we had this guy on and tried to have them explain to us. Of course we're idiots. So we didn't, we don't know if what he's saying is right or wrong. He might be completely full of shit. He might be making shit up. We, we, you know, brian and I have no idea. And so I said, well, let me get matt stags to see if he can get someone to debate them. Nobody would debate the dude. Everybody was telling me I was an asshole for having them on because, okay, I don't know, but are you sure that he's not right?

Speaker 4:          01:38:40       He's got damn biologist at the university of California, berkeley published biologist who has read all this like peer reviewed research on cancer that everybody respects. And he's saying crazy shit like hiv doesn't cause aids. The problem is I'm an idiot. Okay. So when I go online and I try to read the arguments, like whether or not it does or doesn't, it seems to me that if more people are saying it does, then I would go with them because they're scientists, right? There's a few of these row guys like him that say it's just they're taking aim on nitrate and they taking crystal meth and they're just crushing their immune system and that's why these guys were all getting sick and that it's not hiv killing them. It's partying, it's killed. But then people say, oh, you're a homophobe for saying this. And it's a terrible thing he's doing and it's an justin's and blood is on his hands and people are still dying of aids and hiv because they don't take care of themselves.

Speaker 4:          01:39:29       Exactly. Exactly. Copper bottle looks like this is so ironic. If anybody hears this and you know, I'm sorry. Well that's legal. I rent the horse. Yeah, you can just buy them in the stores for what? What's the use for? What are you supposed to use it for? Oh my god. Wholesale gay poppers. That's legal. Hold on son. And go back. Listen, I'm dropping knowledge on homes today. Don't promote these because these are probably killing people. But uh, if anybody knows anybody that's a biologist who wants a date, a date, peter duesberg, show them some aids. No debate. My apologies. Mr duisburg sir. It was just a joke. I'm a comedian. If there was any other show, I probably, you probably really be mad at me right now. But those jokes happen often. Um, I wanted someone to debate them, but nobody wanted to have any pieces to intelligent or because.

Speaker 4:          01:40:21       No, I think it's like a holocaust denier. Like if you debate a holocaust denier, you actually giving them some form of credit. You're like, by even debating them, especially if they're like a legit historian sits down with a holocaust denier, like it's such a preposterous idea that even to be connected with it is somehow another pro promoting it. And so it's so distasteful that nobody wants to talk to a holocaust denier. It's uh, you know, it's, you don't even give them the time of day holocaust denier. Yes. A deny or someone who says the holocaust didn't happen. There's a lot of people like that out there. By the way. There's

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       a lot of crazy fucks that think that the concentration camps, and then I'm going to get some tweets. Now what would you need to know? Is it the exaggerated numbers? And what I need to know is why are you concentrating on that? Why are you even trying to doubt that aspect of history? I mean, have you ever watched those videos where you see those poor fucking people being led to the concentration camps is no doubt horrific shit went on. You know, you trying to reduce the numbers. It's actually 4 million, not shit. It's horrible time in history, disgusting. And you know, what's really fucked up about the holocaust. It was so recent. You know, when I was a little kid, I remember I was, I was born in 1967 and when I was a little kid, uh, I remember that we were like talking about world war ii and uh, we were talking about world war ii and the holocaust and it seems so long ago because it was, you know, at the time, maybe like 30 years ago, I was like 1977 or something like that when I was 10 and it seems like a million years ago, but now when I think back of 30 years ago, like 1977 is like basically 30 years ago.

Speaker 1:          01:42:06       That shit is so recent. It's so goddamn recent. Like I can remember 19, 77. I don't remember a lot of things. I remember my mother had a gold barracuda, you know, um, I remember, uh, we, uh, lived in san francisco. I remember I remember some shit from, from 1977. So that freaks me out that that recently people could have done that, that, that recently people could have just decided that all jews are evil and we're going to kill them all. You know? How many people did stalin kill? You know, how many people? How many people did hitler kill? Just 47. Crazy. You ever seen hitler's artwork? No. It's amazing. He was really talented artists. Like he could have totally just been a famous artist. First of all, how dare you? You're never supposed to give credit a credit at all to hitler. Like someone in the ufc q and a said, if you could fight anyone in history, who would it be?

Speaker 1:          01:43:02       I said hitler. So fuck hitler up. I'd kick the shit out of hitler. That's a. I'll bet the house that I'm going to win. Come on, man. They don't even have vitamins back then. We'll fuck that dude. I was stupid. Mustache. I can look at that. It's pretty sweet though. I mean he was a pretty good artist. That is kind of amazing. So there was a good artist. Yeah. Well, you know, what else was kevorkian? We've shown those on a podcast for member kevorkian was creaky artists guy yet I do not know. I think he did for years. You had to buy them every other week. Now they put them in jail when he was an old man, you know, the whole thing is kind of crazy. She be able to, you know, should be able to die when you went to don man. Especially if you're in fucking serious pain. Like why? Why shouldn't you be able to die? There's a new, uh, hitler's chicken. Have you heard of hitler's chick? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       it's in Thailand. That just opened up and they're kfc is gonna assume because it was an old kfc and they actually,

Speaker 3:          01:43:58       oh my god, hitler fried chicken in Thailand. Oh my god. It's kfc and they just put hitler space on it.

Speaker 1:          01:44:11       So crazy. Why can't you do that though? It has enough time passed. I bet you could sell gingiss conference. I bet if you had gangs. Cons, fries. I think it's because we were.

Speaker 2:          01:44:21       Yeah, but I think it's because ovens are involved, you know, in, you know, the ovens. I didn't think of that.

Speaker 1:          01:44:28       How do you know they're not frying them? Oh, that's true. Yeah. They usually deep frying techniques. Who it. Who gives a fuck? It's chicken. It's not a fucking hoe human. It's just. That's not long enough ago, but you could have gangs. Conference fries. You could have a huge. How about caesar little caesar? How about that? Seizure was an evil cut there. We're all evil. Cons that are responsible for the death of millions now. They're a cute little cartoon and it's holding up a pizza a little season. Do you ever think of that? Think a little caesar. Caesar was a and there's never been a caesar. Julius caesar had never been a caesar, didn't have blood on his hands. Romans were crazy. They were fucking savages by the time the fall of the roman empire was going on. How many of those caesar's didn't have like a few deaths on their hands? Quite a few. What's up with that? Is that the hitler? Hitler chicken. It's fucking crazy. Yeah. Well, hitler didn't walk like that to nazi chicken right now. What does it say? Go back to that fucking bottle yet. What does it say it does to the gay poppers?

Speaker 3:          01:45:27       I'm still fascinated and never left. He's been pretending to care about hitler. Fuck. Fuck that fucking guy. Like I'm done with coke. But poppers and not out of the question. I talked to my doctor for my heart. That's why they sound on the black market gate. Turns out joe rogan gay dudes have a 10 percent healthier heart because of poppers. So tell boasberg you could shove it up your ass.

Speaker 2:          01:45:53       Yeah, the effects are in brief, but intense side effects are a sudden surge of blood to the heart and the brain. So like if you, if you want it to sound good, wanted to answer it really important.

Speaker 3:          01:46:04       Ashley quick, will you marry me on the ass? Or like, let's say if you're in a game show, all right? You get the worst advice ever. Imagine some poor fools in front of jude carries. Try to guess the price is right. And you're like brian, red beds attached to a pump right now. It's isn't it? Uh, it,

Speaker 2:          01:46:36       it, uh, it's time slowing down. It feels like it's time slowing down. So like, uh, it also is a heat flush, sometimes light headiness, giddiness. Someone's doing two to five, five minutes and a, someone's

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       got to do, by the way, speaking of drugs, you see the fucking michael jackson's shit was going on with this trial. No, they ain't give him this motherfucking money though. The worst thing they could have done with this trial was really opened up the world to what this guy really was. Did you see yesterday's article? No, I haven't been following it at all because of the tracks on his ass. Oh no. Like the skin was too damaged from just shooting himself in the ass. So don't like, oh god, this guy was fucking out there and somebody, a doctor that I go to, the seek said to me, he goes, these people don't know what can of worms to open up by doing this. This guy had skeletons in the closet that go back 30 fucking years since off the wall. Well, any guy who's like doing that much to his face, like other craziness that he was doing, like that famous picture of him where he had his nose, like have like a.

Speaker 1:          01:47:47       There was like a skin graft over his nose. I think it was in court. Right? You remember that picture, brian? Yeah. Pull that picture up. See if you could find that picture. There's a picture of michael jackson's nose. That's the old Michael Jackson that we used him drinking whiskey vodka with two midgets. Oh my god. Is that real? Yeah, I think so. You don't even know if that's real. That's a goddamn sketch from the mantro drunk hipster Michael Jackson. No, the guy do it. That was a halloween costume. This is the real Michael Jackson to doves and a pair of underwear. But go, go see if you can find the photo of his nose because it's one of the weirdest things ever. And I remember seeing that saying, this is a strange exercise and culture that we're seeing in Michael Jackson. Oh god. It just pulled it up in a freak because for every human being, um, you know, these are, these are strange times.

Speaker 1:          01:48:40       That's a skin graft over his nose or something. Maybe it's tape looks. It looks like the poster from silence of the lambs. Is that a tape over his nose? It's hard to tell what that is. Is it a bandage? It looks just like skin. It's hard to tell if that skin or some kind of a whole face adhesive or something like that. But he, I remember looking at that image and sanken what is this guy done like with the skeleton? Then I remember thinking, what must the pressure be like when you're that guy? What must reality be like if you start off as a child like super famous and loved by millions, you know, you remember abc is one, two, three. I mean he was huge way, way, way, way, way, way back before anybody knew how to handle it. And he was huge as a baby pro and watching justin bieber, this justin bieber's to make Michael Jackson looks like a fucking puppy. Dog thinks so he's going to be black and like seven years. He seems fine right now. It out.

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       It's trying to get some pussy. Why you hating on them? I'm just telling you what I see. You can't do 90 miles an hour in a. In a. In calabasas around white people. I see it with chrome car. Getting his dick sucked on the [inaudible] too. I see almost hayden.

Our tens, whatever is and it's got leopard print. I forget buying some beliefs. Car to laugh. I healing. You get a razzi. Oh, well someone died on the pacific coast highway because they were trying to take a picture of a pop rocks. He was running across the street and get clipped. He died while I'm looking at that. Is audi leopard print sexy? That is so silly. It's so silly. It's so silly that he would do that. I wouldn't ugly. Look to that car. That's the most bad ass car, like a. That's everlasting is one of those. It's such a wicked looking car to cover that thing with. Looks like leopard print, but that's like, that's the silliest.

Speaker 4:          01:50:52       I can do whatever the fuck I want. Move ever. You know he had a karma fisker. That was chrome. Do you ever see that thing? That's Just preposterous. How dare you.

Fifty dollars, million dollars. You go crazy. The world is your oyster. If somebody comes to you, says, put your money away. You don't listen to that person. You're going to go, fuck you mad.

Speaker 4:          01:51:45       You go to standard and fucking just by waitresses like dog, how much for you, you'd be like that prince or the king of the game of thrones, I'll tell you, be like be evil, you know, the amount of power, like that's not the amount of power that a person should ever attain and it's incredibly rare that a person ever does attain that type of wealth. like you got justin bieber type wealth and the fact that he's getting and when he's 7:00 AM I boring you philosophy you only in the fact that he gets it when he's 17 or whatever the hell he is. How old was he when he got super famous? Was like 17 sunlight younger. What is he now like? Nineteen, something like that. He's like a young man now

Speaker 2:          01:52:24       we have this game that we played at like would, could you beat up so and so, so and so. And we like say it to like, you know, and I said I can beat a bieber because not really thinking. I was like, yeah, he's a little kid. I got old man, fat strength. I could just sit on them or something like that, but then I saw him with his shirt off the other day on some website and it's like, holy shit. That duke would probably desTroy me. He's fucking ripped. He's a little boy

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       now. Fuck you up. Plus the thing is like a blue belt or something. do you think he can beat you up a ds? Absolutely. THat's funny. It's your blue button digital. Somebody told me that he know. You know who is to michael jackson's son? He just got his blue belt. Really? Gracie, torrance. I'm pretty sure. So it's legit. Blue belt. Fucking ustream, man. You streamed. Keeps lagging out. I don't know why you keep sucking it lately. We've got to figure out what's going on with this. But people are complaining not complaining the mornings to shit's going on. Too many commercial dismissed. Well that's the problem we're having. We're just having a problem with cutting out like crazy. But is it. What's that? The app is good. It's working. But is it um, when we uploaded to vimeo, did we get a clean? It's fine. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:53:36       So watch the video. Don't pay attention to us while you're watching this right now anyway, and the fact that it works on the ipad, fine. This goes to believe that it is more, again, a flash plugin problem. That's interesting. So maybe I should try it on another browser. All right, let me try it on another browser. I'm going to shut this bitch off and I'm going to try it. When you're in chrome right there, I'm going to try it on safari. Where you have this weekend. Jodie is got a couple of things this weekend. A couple of spots. Nothing to fucking serious. Next week I go to philadelphia. Yeah, I go to fucking helium.

Speaker 1:          01:54:12       We were talking about like great clubs. Yup. Any better than that? Doesn't get any better than the one in buffalo. I had to change that date and I'm doing portland in september also, so I'm pretty excited. Oh, you're doing helium in portland as well. Oh, sweet baby. Jesus. Pretty excited for philly though. Got to helium. So the bomb dude, they. What am I 12 going to open? Another one in st louis. Greg put it on safari immediately. It lags out immediately. Yeah. I don't know what's going on. You stream. How's paris? Jackson? Um, he looked like he's like 17 or so. I mean the girl. Oh, I think she's like a. She's in her teens I think. I'm sure the 18 year old. I feel bad about her. Don't feel bad about all of them, man. I mean, what a strange way to live your life.

Speaker 1:          01:54:59       If you grow up that famous, you know, what are you doing with that joey? The reading your phone back on the email. Sending it back and this is what I'm saying. What? Nothing. Nothing. I'm looking at this. Little says he left us and he started emailing people like joey diaz is. He ate a candy. I don't know if anybody noticed tHis. You heard some chewing while the show is going on as a half an hour. About an hour ago. He ate a candy and it's clearly kicked in. It hasn't kicked in. You are disassociated from this conversation. Motherfucker won't kick them for later on, you know, with just so. Well this weekend is filling. Next week. Next weekend is filled. You're working with my man, dom, a up at the icehouse. Yeah, I saw that. You guys are co headlining a weekend. That's the

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       beautiful world. That's a great idea. Yeah, that's. That's what a great fucking show. I hope I got a great show. They do the podcasts for them. It's always good to see don thomas cleaning how to be a fucking comic again. You know, you work with tom. You're like that motherfucker does it all. He's a real monologist. That's a different type of savage there. Well, you know, all the time. I've known don. He's never faltered. Like he's always loved being a comic and that's, you know, someone was talking about it. I think it was bill burr was saying he really loves the fact that like dom has been in it, you know, he was in it. He was like a veteran when we all started and yet he still has a lot of love for it. Some guys, they fade off, they get older and they just not funny anymore.

Speaker 4:          01:56:21       Don hasn't lost a step. He's hilarious. He's fucking hilarious, man. I watched him to stand up like before he did that, you know, he does the talk, por portion of it. His standup is still one of the fees on tonight. I was done that last spot down there last night. And then on the way up I had a followup at the laugh factory. How was that the laugh? There was 30 people. Wow. But it was okay. You know, I did 30 people on monday night and then fucking I want to put the ha and I seen david for a little while in front of 12 people and what damon wins. He's making a comeback. It's only going through 12 people, 12 people. He always liked doing that though. He loved it. He would show up at 1230 at night with pain and somebody always a and he'll, you know what I love about damon, I used to love watching damon work shit out because he'll like really work something out a killer, have an idea on stage.

Speaker 4:          01:57:14       It's just Like a couple of words or a couple of, not a couple of words, but a couple of concepts, you know, and he'll take them. And just run with him and because he's gotta make all these people laugh. Like the pressure of that will lead him because he's a great writer. Leads him to the best lines all the time. I used to watch him work shit out on stage. Like he would write right. But he would also work shit out on stage. Whereas mooney did a lot of writing, like moonee would come in there and something would happen. Like you remember the airplane crashed Florida and crashed in the swamp and mooney did a bit about old black ladies still clutching their purse. I remember that they pull them out of the crocodile. They still clutching their purse. Like he had that like written like within a couple of days of, of the the plane crash and it was a written bit, you know, he did it.

Speaker 4:          01:58:04       so he would like capitalizing. You always have a lot of new shit but it would be like a written bit. Whereas you could see damon was like working it out while he was up there. He would have an idea and he would just flush it out while I was up there. And so when it would hit him, like the punchline would hit him, he would start crackinG up like not like that fake cracking up shit that bad comedians do. It's gross, right? When you see people fake laughing, you know, big bitch. You laugh the exact same way every night when you tell that joke, that's a fake laugh, you know, that fake laugh. It's gross. But damon would like every now and then he really make himself laugh, you know, I've watched him do those late night sets of the store bunch of times. You know, it's

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       funny. The other morning I was watching tv, I got up and bruce lee's changed. The world was on. Eddie griffin came on. I got to tell you, a big smile came on my face before I walked in here. Brian and I were talking about the comedy store and he's telling me how the crew that hangs out there and how it's changed and blah, blah blah and blah blah blah. And you know, he's enthusiastic about it. What brian doesn't understand this. I already went to fucking college there. Do you know what I'm saying? We did our fucking time. It's not even about you or carlos' name. I don't give a fuck for me. I did my fucking time. Then I did my eight years of spots and sundays and following dice. When you got, when you, you know what it's like to have two other sets and you go to do your set and fucking dice is going up.

Speaker 3:          01:59:22       As you pull up you're like, oh, this is going to be great and awesome. They're like, dice is going up. Like when I was, I was talking to you, I could still see us sitting by the back and mooney how he would walk up to the checkup bucks. I'm here. Give them the light, you know, and just all those little things. That was my college, my college. But you don't go back to high school. You don't go back to, you feel like a fucking moron. And naturally it was the comedy store for me was law school. It was six fucking years of hard fucking work of snorting, blow fucking eating pills, eating pussy, women, you know, line. Trying to get a manager trying to go up there and fucking get a couple of drinks on a rocker coke. It was an adventure, you know, he was saying that robert and I remember the night I was up last night with the night, we're going to light them on fire, that I'm locked in the bathroom. People throwing paper towels and they're on fire, you know, I mean, this is fucked up. I mean it's just, uh, it's just. I still remember corey cuomo calling me and going, did you threaten him? And corey, I'm in miami. I've been here for three weeks. That's how fucking crazy he is. Okay. That's how fucking crazy robert epa buyers, like I avoided them after that where he accused me of doing something and I was out of town.

Speaker 2:          02:00:34       The Bestest had him in it. Don barris. That's so crazy. It's going on for decades. Chinese guy. What's the. Don't, don't, don't you do this to rob it up? No, no he does that indicate nazis. Nazis the finger. This hitler mustache finger. Don was on stage last night and he just runs in room. There was like maybe like 30, 40 people in the room and just goes on stage and so on. One map provides all the managers have to like get robert out or they're using lasers and paper towels and stuff, but robert is still a good institution. Indians and he's in an institution like he's a part of the store. Absolutely, and he still goes up every night. Every night. I'm nice to him. I never do anything. I'm always playing nice guy, but everyone, all the other guys always fucking throw menus. I've always been cool. I've always been really neat to see that.

Speaker 3:          02:01:24       Oh yeah. I never had a beef with him till he accused me of threatening them when I was out of town. don't understand that I was sitting on the stairs. I was sitting on the stairs and like throwing paper towels and enlightened them on fire and he's in there like, oh, what's the smell? Fire run out of there. You

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       walk. It was really dangerous with him because you, your member, especially in the winter, he would insulate himself with plastic bags. He had these plastic bags, the stuff inside of his clothes keep them warm because he would walk home and he'd be in downtown, so he didn't. He'd walked downtown like when he would leave the comedy store, he would walk like five miles. That was no joke. Like he that he did that all the time.

Speaker 2:          02:02:04       He, he still does that and he goes to the grocery store after every show, every night he does it, gets the exact same thing, like a banana and like a sandwich. And don paris does tHe exact same thing. He follows him into it. That's so fucked up, man.

Speaker 4:          02:02:22       What? You know, that's one of those things that the store had was those long running gags. Like, do you remember what o'brian counts? Still does it with don burris every time. Brian callahan, tom paris, he's each other. He pretends that brian brian pretends that dom buress is forcing them to suck his cock and so fights it off for awhile and they're like put on a show. And then finally Brian Campbell put his lips right on. Barris, his cock and, and, and, and barrels will be humping his face. It's so fucking, and they go for it. It's so uncomfortable to watch.

Speaker 2:          02:02:54       This is a new who is robert from two nights ago and there's a girl on stage with no clothes on. She never wears underwear. She always brags about fucking ron. Jeremy. Could you tell us on stage or on the. YeaH, it's totally fine. But she, uh, she, she's been like going on stage and like showing her vagina to him and stuff like that and he shows them to robert. It's getting real nervous

Speaker 4:          02:03:17       by the way. How durable is that? jacket and pants jacket and pants is 100 years old. this motherfucker's been wearing that same jacket pants every day for a long time. Those are some strong threads.

Speaker 2:          02:03:30       Yeah, I think he might have a few of them though. So this girl, she goes on stage all the time, like all the girls. This is from last night, you know, there's mary jane and eleanor and stuff like that. And eleanor was there. Oh yeah, she's there every night. She really. Yeah. But it's cool because all these girls are on like the ding dong show and stuff like that. But it's fun. Tylenol is very funny, man. She's a very funny stand up now. It's interesting. We always kind of knew she was a funny person when she was working at the store. Are these all standups? These girls? Yeah. That's a schizophrenia surfer. He's got schizophrenia, schizophrenia and he, I used to do open mics with him and in west hall or in a cafe while you're talking about the point when I'm asking him about the girls, girls in their underwear and it's like, yeah, that guy. So there's mary jane, her don's girlfriend. So these girls are all standup comedians. So the like a community down there of girls stand. Oh yeah. And what's cool is that me and tony hinchcliffe, sap podcasts have a, uh, two girls stand ups that started on the show and they've never done standup comedy before. And every week we get tHem, given them one minute and they're like, that's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Stand

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       up comedy. It needs more chicks. It's not enough funny checks in this world. I don't know when things are going bad like they are now. That's when more funny ones will rise. Is more funny, crazy bitches or wherever you shop somewhere. Jerry lewis did well. He says it went off a month ago. What did he do? Dirty bitches. He doesn't think women are funny, right? I can't stand them talking to me. I don't think that funny. I laugh. There's plenty of funny women. THat's a silly thing to say. This is funny. People. If someone's funny, they're funny. The idea that you would say that they're not funny because they're check. Tell me morgan murphy stuff. Funny to pitches. Hilarious. She's lyrics. Sarah silverman's not funny. Sarah silverman is fucking hilarious.

Speaker 2:          02:05:17       This girl right here, this is katie means out of the girls who's mom was married to hugh hefner. This girl right here though. Her name is jessica shores and she has a music video that she just put out like a month ago that already. It has like one point 2 million hits and her dancing around with you. If you look at it though, you'll let her. I when I left last. Nope. I don't know. I won't laugh my ass off. I can't believe we're still talking about it. You would in a a laugh about it way. Yeah. No, thanks.

Speaker 4:          02:05:50       I've been there. I've done that. Stop trying to make me sad. You never get a hankering to go back there and we drive by. Do you ever wish you could just pull it into our set? No. No shit. Still you're doing the improv. I been there lately. Just got a text from rita. I gotta text her back. The improv is a I. That bar freaks me out. Oh, the persian barring the bar. I'm like, what? What does this recessed lighting the fucking lamps built into the wall and shit. I'm like, what are you guys doing?

Speaker 2:          02:06:19       Glad you said that, because I was like, you need a corner that you can suck at the end. There's no. There's no hidden corners here. It doesn't feel like a comedy club. It all with white booths. Like where are we? Are we in miami in 1998. It feels like a hotel room or a hotel bar.

Speaker 4:          02:06:36       Yeah, it feels like a road gig. Yeah, it feels like a gig you would do if you're in western Massachusetts where they had like the bar. The club still is great once you get inside the actual setup is pretty fucking perfect, you know, and the way they have it now with the bar over there, it does have less noise because people have to leave and go down that hall and then take a right and then take a left. So it's probably like quieter for them that way. It just seems weird. I guess that that annex though, it wasn't making any money, you know? Also they got rid of the annex. Annex doesn't exist anymore. Well

Speaker 2:          02:07:06       they were the bars. We're also renting out the, the front part of it to a hamburger place. So kind of hamburgers going to be that umami. It's actually. Oh, nami burger. I don't know if I've had those before. The weirdest thing, the weirdest. The weirdest thing is, is that the murals I, if you've ever been to the hollywood improv, we used to have like these big drawings or paintings on over him. Yeah. And they're just this new mural that all the people. Yeah, and it's huge and it's just a bunch of comics and you sit there and you're trying to figure out who's who. Everyone does not look like who they are and it looks

Speaker 1:          02:07:35       really like a picture. How I, the only picture I have is there's only one microphone on this mural like and there's only one person standing in front of the microphone and this is like a simulation theory, but that one thing is a fucking dolphin for some reason, for no reason at all. A dolphin in front of the microphone and then you could kind of see a couple of comics here. Like I can't tell. I know who that is. Just the puppets. That's the only photo of it. That's the only photo I have. I can find, see if I can find like only a partial of the part of the euro dolphin. It's weird that it would have on sunglasses too. I dunno man. There's no. There's no rhyme or reason. there's no logic to why they would take down those other paintings. Those pins were old as fuck.

Speaker 1:          02:08:18       There was like a part of history I think here. I think here's the, uh, here's the, here's a new story about it. The new mural. Oh god, there's a story in the news. You always comedy club in west hollywood comics for conservation. It's happening right now. We'll see. Look at that mural. There's the dolphin fast, incredible mural over the past couple of days here. Let's look at it. You can't robin williams, you'll, you'll sit here and look at it and you won't even, you can't even figure out half a terrible piece of artwork. I don't want to say it's terrible. So his style does not look like the people at all. Like, like if you look at Jeff Ross, it looks like Jeff Ross, Jeff Ross, special needs.

Speaker 1:          02:09:11       That is where they have the unknown comic with a paper bag over said, thank god. So now the entrance, it's over here. Where the, what the fuck I'm mural. Is that? Yeah. And there's so many. Like there was somebody there that, I forget who it was that george carlin's pretty obvious. Well, some of the people like really obvious. It's pretty obvious, but let's see if I can get it. I don't want to make fun of it, but it's just shut it off. let's. Let's be nice, but it doesn't matter. That's what the comments are saying. It's kind of weird going over there now because people are like, what's up with this bar? And it was just crazy mural. Somebody fucked up. Somebody's got crazy and they forgot that things are nice when they stay the same. Yep. They forgot the end of the day. Who gives a fuck? Fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck. Jesus christ. Joe diaz. You know what I'm saying? Who gives a fuck about some fucking ugly ass? That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying, dawg. What else was like a motherfucker will movies you see lately? Anything good? I saw despicables a movie and it was a good move. They just kid movies. So good fucking movie. Almost good cartoons now. Fuck television. Fuck all that family guy. I'm watching spongebob. that's the shit. You're fucking lives in a pineapple. It's true under the seat. It's true. Is it good because of the three d or you just. Did you

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       just like. The first one was great. The first one's not bad either. They're going to the movies. I love all that shit. Then it's like it's. I mean obviously I went for my kids but it's legitimately good movie, but that's where they put that fucking screen. That's why they put the creativity and the kid shit in the adult. Shit. You sit there. my friend said you went to see the end of the world. We lAst night and this guy is a white dude, is very geeky and he went to see the Kevin Hart means at the end of the world you had to walk out of really. And Kevin Hart thing was okay, that was just too big to do stand up at the garden. He felt like it was just too big. The tape day he goes at the end and he watched the credit and he goes, it was 30 fucking camera man.

Speaker 3:          02:11:10       You know what I'm saying? 30th camera man. So it just didn't feel intimate and make them feel intimate enough, which I, when you're doing those fucking places, you don't, you feel, you don't feel intimidated, you know, there's a certain level, like $1,800 or something after that, it's all downhill after that. For a guy that rants, it's downhill for a guy who's very slowly. When we seen the guy in jersey, a slow pace, that's great. but a guy who steps on his own lines and I just don't like it. It was absolutely right. That is the issue when people laugh and you can't hear what they're saying. I don't like 1800 or above. You don't want. It's nice money. Yeah, we have a good time, but I don't feel good when I walk off the set. I don't feel like I did nothing. I'm just struggling to talk slow.

Speaker 3:          02:11:51       My patois jb. All my timing was off. You know? I liked it. That's why I'm, I don't know where I want to shoot a special. I'd like to shoot it at somewhere where it's fucking small. I don't want to do theaters. I don't want people to come see me in a fucking. They ended up punching. I honestly, atlanta punch. I was a great idea. That's a great idea. I honestly think 300 is the threshold for things getting different to 72, seven, two, seven, 9:50 gets a little kinky, put even carbs. It's tremendous. It's big though. It's too bad. Carbs is tremendous. And then when you have the Little thing on top, that's a little fucked up too. On top of it. In the back it goes way back and above this we don't sell much of a connection is a perfect place to take this perfect place.

Speaker 3:          02:12:34       American comedy co because they're not bad either, but there's a lot of pillars and that spot. I don't want to shoot in California. That's the problem. We do shit here. Do we want to go somewhere to light up a state like grand funk railroad? We're an american band. Will come through your town. We're running american fucking man. Are you kidding me? That's a jam dog. Listen to that will help you. Partied down. We'll bring cheap cheekbones refa papers. Yeah. No, that's it. So I want to go somewhere when you do a set in la, it's fun, it's great. but they could see us anytime. I could. If I was ruling ck, you jump up and down. If I was fucking, you know, Kevin Hart, I do fucking whatever. Stand up, live downtown, whatever. That's. But I'm not and I never got to. I don't want to do that kind of standup. I Rather put smaller. That's why I do good when I got on a rant and shit in a big theater. I it what's also,

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       it's a matter of how much money do you really need? Because if you start getting into the eight and 10,000 seats, it's one thing if you're doing it because the demand is really high. You don't want anybody to not be able to go because you know, the shows would be all sold out, but you can make a lot of money Just doing clubs. I mean, how much money does a comic need to exist in this life? You know, if you're, if you're living like a normal person, you can do clubs and you can make plenty of money. You know, but the show will be more like you, like I can go see you in a hundred seats. You can be screaming and yelling at the top of your lungs and ran. I'll know every word that comes out of your mouth. There'll be no questions.

Speaker 4:          02:14:11       What did he say? I couldn't hear. There'd be none of that, but when you get into those two and 3000 seat places, there are a moment and I noticed that when we watched that guy in jersey, there was a moment. There was a few moments where I didn't know what he had said because he was like ranting as they were laughing and I was like, oh, this is interesting. Very interesting. Dynamics were great for a 2,400 seat theater. The dynamIcs of chicago. Oh yeah. tremendous. I rented there and they came up perfectly, but that's a very few and far between that that place is magical. Magical. I would also consider shooting a special if it wasn't so big in the place we did in pittsburgh. That was a great place to theater. That was the carnegie library, lord god, that was. That was used to be an old library, was no library.

Speaker 4:          02:15:00       There's so many places. If I could find a good old fucking joint, 600 seats in it, you should just do it at helium, man. I want to do that. Either helium, portland, do it important. They'll go crazy. I want to do a brick wall. A brick wall, a brick wall. What does portland have giggled? We can put this up. Giggles, giggles. Helium giggles is a comedy club that I used to do in boston. Boston. Yeah. Giggles was also in seattle. A place that was run by the Vietnam vet that would take a draw from them on thursday by saturday. He forgot he was and then I call them monday asking who was then next week and he'd go over his last time you worked at club. Oh, that's hilarious. Years ago. Friday he had. He forgot that bad everything. Once I learned I would get the waitress on saturday and find that.

Speaker 4:          02:15:50       What was the feature act next week on monday nine slash 11. What's up buddy? Joe diaz. Who's featuring this week. When was the last time you were at? My club was a year ago. You had to be fucking spotless clean. Right? But he wouldn't show up until to see the headliner and there was a curtain on the stage and you can see this jaguar pull up. Oh, that's a jaguar pulled up. I did my clean stuff as soon as you want. If you only come in for one minute and I just bombed for two minutes, look at the back and going, this is hysterical. This is how much, how? This is how a box this guy was. I forget the guy's name. He's a track coach and seattle, very good guy was

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       on hbo. She's just a college track coach. He doesn't travel as much. He was headlining and he's a great comic and a great monologist. He's completely clean. This motherfucker gets off stage and the owner of the club goes up and he goes, let me tell you something. I went in there three minutes ago when you were being dirty. Don't ever do that in my cLub. He's like me

Speaker 4:          02:16:51       and finally comes up

Speaker 3:          02:16:52       because I was just about to ratchet, but I remember he's a Vietnam vet and he got hit with a missile or something.

Speaker 4:          02:16:59       He sold it. He sold the club to a mormon and yes, we talked about the mormon. Got mad at us and then he offered me a week up there. Now it's done. Yeah, it's done. Yeah. He got bad because he had sent somebody home or said someone couldn't work there or something changed salmon or san jose, one of those guys, once someone, someone had problems with them and so I was, I just wanted to put the word out so that I can't work wise guys and advil. he was, he was in wise guys in salt lake. He left and he bought giggles. Uh, so I never did that club. That was, I think I'd heard about it, but it was like, you gotta be, you have to be cleaned. And then he left bobby slayton work there. That was what he did. He called them. He goes, no, no, no, no. I don't allow cleaning. But bobby slayton work there and he was saying something like, this is not my cup of tea, you know, like he, he said it was when he was bringing up the show or something like that. This is not my type of show. I just want to say that like he like introduced the show that way and someone was offended and he was a shimano or it was bobby, bobby slayton, one of those guys

Speaker 3:          02:18:05       fucking went thursday night was the capital of town and that was a seattle gig and friday and saturday with giggles and the.

Speaker 4:          02:18:16       Do you know what's fucking fantastic. Polar live in bellevue. Have you done that place yet,

These savage savage. Oh my god. Let's go up there and get it out and then I could probably go up there with you next month. I'm there july 26 thompson girl. Uh, where am I in july? That's two weeks.

I'm doing me and sigora shadows a fucking bad ass town. We had a good time up there when I was looking for bigfoot to drop. They're squashing someplace I disrespected but not really. why did you do respect it? This, I lived up there with that fucking filthy animals. It was, ended up choking her out. she stabbed me.

Speaker 4:          02:20:24       Disrespect in seattle because of that, you know. And that'S why like I broke right now. I love to get outta here and I love you bro. There's only one place for me to go. And that's Colorado. Yeah, that's it. But I felt like I disrespected him. Like I would have to disrespect to Colorado had done, you know, when you really. Why? because I fucked up there a long time ago, man. You're a different human now. That don't mean nothing. It's a. That's a thing in Colorado. It's large country. That's like god's country, bro. When you driving in Colorado, you're breeding that at you and fucking god's living room. I don't know what the fuck did describe to me. One of the things about boulder is just that you're at the base of those mountains and you use or you leave boulder, you drive 10 minutes.

Speaker 4:          02:21:02       Welcome to the woods. Like literally you are. It's 10 minutes out of boulder. You are in the woods and the beauty of that place is so hard. It's so stunning that it affects people. It affects people. It's like living around the most insane artwork all the time. I really do believe that. I think that's one of the reasons why the people were so healthy there. I think the view, it's not just the, the air is clean, which it is, but it's also like the view of those mountains like enriches you. I really believe that. I think there's something to places like that, especially because it's a college town, so it was like intelligent people. They're intelligent, cool people at the base of a mountain, this insane view. Listen dog that's buying some land and let's do this. Let's start a farm sort of fucking colony up there on my daughter to be raised there.

Speaker 4:          02:21:47       Why not? Let's do it. You want to go? I want to go. Collin wants to go snow. Trying them before some the girl that's got nothing for you. Brian canes and fucking pain. All that shit kills you brian. And box them up and birdcages from the mansion. Ship them up southwest. I want to shoot my. You know what man?

Take two weeks in denver. I'll open for you when you do your special. You overwhelming what I do for you to bring me up on stage somewhere.

Speaker 4:          02:22:31       I'll do it. Fuck yeah, dude. You tell me. I'll do it. I'll be happy to do it. Even if I just come in just to bring you up. I'd be happy to this. What's the next religion? Ufc. You brought me up every special I ever did except the I'm going to be dead someday. That was mcguire. Every single thing that was houston. Every single thing I've done since then. You brought me up. No. Uh, what's the next big ufc fighter? Brazil. Brazil? Yeah. Yeah. That's um. Well no, there's a seattle, demetrius johnson. John moraga.

I'm going to be at the show, but I'm not going to fight.

Speaker 4:          02:23:17       I'm going to be at the show though. Yeah, with two shows sold out. Who show boom son sockets. You got to get to Alaska, joe the next day. You gotta listen to me this this summer before the time is up. Before it gets cold there. Go go to anchorage. Alaska did comedy. I did. Yeah. I did some fucking bear tooth lodge or something like that. Wasn't the name of the then bear tooth. I think it was. Bear to bear to theater. It's a theater. They show movies there and then they have a comedy show. It was flooded. We went to anchorage. Anchorage. Okay. You didn't go to chuck with charlie's? no, no. I went to this bear to theater. Wherever the fuck it is. It was amazing. They grow, they grow. They have their own beer there. They grow their own pattern, not powder. It's like they brew their own beer.

Speaker 4:          02:24:03       It's amazing. Make sure I'm saying the name right. Bear to fudge is it? YeaH. Yeah. It was amazing, man. It was a. It was. It's. It's one of those places where as you're up there like you would think before you went there, you'd be like, who the fuck would live in Alaska? Like my friend eric, eric, chris sugartree cues, he used to live in Alaska. There's a queue. Makerbot ask you mager makes pool cues like the best pool cues. And uh, he was, he at one point in time he did a, he was working, I think he lived at a base there when he was in the military or lived there when he was in the military and he always talks about going back there and I go, why the fuck would you go to Alaska? Man, are you crazy? I was thinking about how cold it is and all the stories that I've heard.

Speaker 4:          02:24:49       But then you get there and you're like, I see it, I get it. I've been the same thing happened to me once. I got it. I get it. It's weird. We go outside to third in the morning. It's blight out at 2:30 in the morning. We, we, we did our show. We took pictures after the show we hung out. I would just want to go party all night. oh yeah. I'm sure people do. And by the way, that myth of know pretty girls there. Myth, the myth of 10 to one men myth, it's more than half of the population of anchorage's girls and there. There's a lot of hot ones. I'm. THey're like rugged hot. what we can. The bruise

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       up strip club. I don't know. I don't know. We didn't go to the strip clubs. You hear about it? No, we, we, we did basically was. We fished all day. We're efficient. We got up, we went on a, we rented an outfitter and went for 10 hours at a stretch. So we did two long days and the first day we did 10 hours. The second day we actually called it quits, like a little early so that we could get ready for the show because we were exhausted. I'm not saying you went to the strip close, but we didn't do any of that. People were saYing you got to go to anywhere we go. and this strip club there was huge because women come from all over the middle and early. Two tHousands that there's a ratio of 10 to one men to women go up there and the dav, a seasoned efficiencies and they'd make a fucking thousand shaking.

Speaker 1:          02:26:09       Yeah, there's another season in late july and the silver salmon are running like, uh, towards, uh, towards the end of the month. apparently. That's another big time when people come up. And then it's also people would come up for the various hunting seasons. Like moose season starts in september. People come up for that. But god damn that places majestic. You see eagles, you just see eagles everywhere. We saw five moose were there for two days. We saw five loose. And there's just something about the place. It just makes you humble, you know, it makes you, it humbles you because it's just, it's when you're flying over, you look down, your jaw just drops because it goes on for ever. And Then forever you see nothing. You just see mountains and trees and mountains and trees and mountains and trees and mountains and trees. And then, okay, we're starting our descendant to aspen or to anchorage.

Speaker 1:          02:26:57       And he slowly start scooting into anchorage. And by you get there, when you get there, you're like, these people are gangster as fuck. Like you think about how far their living from the real world. Like they're up there on some weird little patch of land that they've assigned to clear out some trees and start some fires and a fucking half a million of them up there. It was like 300,000 people live in there and it's only like, I think the whole state only has like double that or something like that. I think it's only like 600,000 people in the whole state, but anchors got like 300,000 people you could live there, man. I'm telling that four hours away before we even start the party. Yeah. We'll get to seattle, to Alaska and get to seattle from Alaska and to. That's great. What am I gonna eat salmon the rest of my life.

Speaker 1:          02:27:41       You know what I'm saying? How to get the other places. If you could live anywhere outside of la. Now I know now that you have your little daughter, you. I'm sure you're probably thinking, I don't want her growing up in California. That's one of the things that I thought of immediately when my first daughter was born on diego. So beautiful to goes to Mexico sun. If you could go to another state, whIch one would it be? Colorado. It would be Colorado. Why not? Yeah. I can't figure out. What about seattle would you do that? If you get home, I'll come fucking living in seattle from september to december to credit to doctor. I love these people are like cool. Yeah. So yeah. Cool. go up there in september and with

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       uc two fucking weeks of nonstop bucket of rain and the gutters and you can't go nowhere and all you want to do is wake up, look around. You know when you wake up here, you got to pee in the sun, creeping through your windows. What do you do when you wake up for two weeks and it fucking gray and then there's grant in november and it gets a little sunny for three days. Then it's rainy again for three weeks ago. Relaxed, right? Everybody wants to know danger. Everybody wants to be a fuck up. It's already in there for two days and all of sudden we got the place packed down, lived there for six fucking months. Seattle is great and the people are great. It's great to do comedy there. It wasn't for fucking me that long stretch from september to december. It rain or build up and fuck you.

Speaker 3:          02:28:59       There's more to life than fucking waking up the fucking rain, my friend. It's like living in buffalo, New York. What the fuck? What are you. What is that called? The protractor where you put the protractor, the buffalo and put the protractor. The fucking seattle. It's in the same missile, the same missile. Take our buffalo and then shooting. Taken out fucking seattle. They got the saMe suicide fucking rates. You know you go to fucking buffalo dog. It's a tough lift. I love it. I love it, but there's a tough lift. I think it's hard to fuck around with California in july and go, yeah, it's nice shadows who are just in the suMmer. The only problem with counseling wAs too many people. That's the only problem that I think that if you got to add, that might be the move to santa barbara, might be the move someone needs to do a helium and santa barbara.

Speaker 3:          02:29:44       Do you know how bad asset would be? That theater that we did was perfect. We don't need to know. Helium is in santa barbara. That data we did for 600 seat again. Which fucking gorgeous. When I do it again, say the word december, december the week before christmas. I love it. That's because we still got to do with doing vegas. Vegas. December 27th. We can't we, but we still got to do an end of the world somewhere. Real english. They offered us the wilbur theater again. Do it boston. No, here. But we have to and rather than doing the wilbur, we have to do the wheelchair and the day before christmas. That's the end of the world with the 23rd. Yeah. Yeah. Because once a nobody wants to go out and christmas eve. No, two days before christmas shopping and shit. December 20th. But last time we did it December 21st December 21st.

Speaker 3:          02:31:27       so much fun with that was they weren't stoners. We just hung out at the bar. We didn't go out to smoke one time. I didn't go out to smoke at all. I was fucking stolen. That edible. I was just talking with the players on the planet fucked up at 9:30 by four. I was fucked up in that whole total three gummies before I went on stage. Can we bear? I've been celebrate and then I would love to go to seattle on a regular basis. I wish I can get you in and all that shit, but I can't risk going to jail for something that happened eight fucking years ago that nobody. Nothing bad happened. Nothing. Yeah.

Um, I don't have a gig booked until the end gig booked out of town at least until seattle, but I got some other shit cooking. I'm trying to finish up this tv show till when it's, it's, it's more difficult than I thought it was going to be. It's more difficult time wise and the thought I was going to be and it's more difficult as far as like getting it right. It's a lot of work, you know, we're putting together kind of a crazy show, but ari's in it and duncan's in it too and there's a lot of interviews that they're doing when I'm not there, like I said, dunkin to interview some scientists and are, he goes and interviews from other scientists and all these other crazy people involved in all these different disciplines.

Speaker 1:          02:33:01       So it's kind of interesting and it's a way. We're only hoping it coMes out. Right. It's a big experiMent, right. BecAuse he ran with a scientist. So, you know, he's very intelligent man. He's very good at, uh, at, at interviewing people and talking to the people. We had them talk to some, uh, some crazy religious guy and we went to the global future 2045 conference in New York. What a bunch of fucking intelligent super freaks. That place was filled with. It was so fascinating. All these people with robots that look just like them and there were people with bionic hands and like the, the, the cutting edge of life extension science. And we had already interviewing some religious guy. It was really weird. There was these religious guys and they were all like telling people that, you know, not to, not to concentrate on, on technology and not to be persuaded by technology, but the beauty of a rose cannot be defined by science who should know why a seed becomes a flower and that flower becomes a beautiful part of it was like this weird resistance sort of, you know, and like this weird trying to incorporate their religion into the idea of the future.

Speaker 1:          02:34:10       And you're like, listen bitch, she can't left behind getting left by. You're dressed like a wizard and you're getting left behind. No mattEr what you do.
