Speaker 1:          00:00:02       How strong are these? Shouldn't have to write. I definitely wouldn't have two of those. Okay. I'm talking trust. So it's a 240 milligrams of caffeine. Now I can feel it rising inside of me. That baby. See why you want to ruin star wars? What? Ali's kidding. I'm not going to do that man. I heard a lot of people are saying that they, uh, they, they heard it was crap and that it wasn't good. But everybody I know that saw it said it was awesome. I loved it. You loved it. I didn't like it. It's like, what are you thinking, man? What did you think we are going to go see? It's called Star Wars. Like it's the most obvious kind of thing. I don't know why people have expectations for star wars. It was the expectations I guess they're looking for or a plot. I guess they're looking for. No, you know what I mean? I guess they're looking for some kind of like deep like meaning or something like Quintin Tarantino or some. Some kubrick ask thing. It's star wars. It's a space opera. It's like I go in there with no expectations, be happy for the colors, that's it, the beautiful colors, and then after that, if there's something out, it's things flying through space and lasers.

Speaker 2:          00:01:18       It's a very confined genre. It's very confined and you know it's not going to step outside of the box. It's not going to be weird sexually not going to have some strange murder tension because I'm going to be any like any unrequited love. There's going to be just some normal space themes with Joseph Campbell's hero's journey. That's it. It's mixing with a lot of mystical stuff that you can connect to you, which is beautiful. It's great. I had lucas talk about his friend Joseph Campbell, like literally wrote star wars based on Joseph Campbell's steps of a hero's journey. Fascinating. They were. There were good friends. Yeah. The hero with a thousand faces. This is classic book and then he did have you seen his interviews with Bill Moyers? Power of myth. That was fantastic. He's awesome. So Joseph Campbell used to go up and give a lecture at Lucas ranch every year on mythology.

Speaker 2:          00:02:10       Lucas ranch where George Lucas ranch up in Morin or sonoma and so he would go up and when they were working on the original star wars and give a lecture to the crew, everybody about mythology every year and then when Campbell died, your friend in mind, Stanley kripner filled in for him. Oh Wow. That's interesting. Wow. Stanley's amazing. Till I just saw him a week ago. Dunkin happened to text me while I was talking with doing the podcast with Stanley or just finished and I said, oh, you gotta meet my friend Duncan. He's really interesting. He's, yeah, he's a comedian, but he's really into the spiritual stuff and he just got back from seeing a hanging out with Ram das in Hawaii and Stanley says, well, does he know that Ron doss was a standup comedian for a time? I feel like he got him mixed up with Timothy leary because I know timothy leary

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       went on tour doing like some some kind of thing called stand up, but I don't think rahm does did it, but I know Timothy leary tried stand up. Well, he said he saw him in the village and the club does. Why not? Man? He's probably on acid. Richard Alpert. He was probably thinking, fuck it. Why not? Let me give it a shot. I mean, he's a good. He's a great speaker and he is pretty funny. Yeah. You said he's like a very humorous guy to talk to him. He's super funny. Yeah. Which is I, I've noticed that seems to be a quality and people who have a real spiritual practice like funny. They're always funny. They always have this real specific non bullshit style of humor. It's really hard to offend them. That's quite often. That's how I can tell if somebody's got a real practice is usually impossible to offend.

Speaker 1:          00:03:51       Like there isn't anything that you can say that's gonna make them upset, but you know the alarm bells start going off in my mind when you get around people who you say something and you see, oh shit, I triggered the alarm system. I have offended this person, which is really curious to me like, how are you? How are you in tune with the universe? And yet still something that a monkey descendant says out of the end of his feeding tube, it causes you to feel results in durable. If you're so tough. How you, why are you such a pussy? It was a truly, well, well not, not like, it's like the opposite of tough, but you know, I mean I agree like sophisticated. Well until you know what's going on. It's the way, the way they've described it or I've heard it described, which is super cool when they, when they, whenever they were I'm das talks about is his guru, neem Karoli Baba, is that there was nothing there. Like there's no obstruction. Like anything. Everything was just sort of going through this person, you know, as opposed to like me, I get on the phone with Bank of America, they've frozen my card because I went to Australia and like I'm saving with rage.

Speaker 3:          00:05:03       Fuck. I haven't another fucking country.

Speaker 1:          00:05:06       My fucking bank, you know, and you know, or whatever it is that triggers you to freeze up. Some people they get to the point theoretically or that like convulsive seizure, like freezing up. It

Speaker 3:          00:05:19       doesn't happen. I'll tell you, I can get that in spurts. I can get done in spurts from Yoga and here's what I can prove it. A guy fucking nailed me on the highway while he wasn't paying attention, hit the brakes, skid. I watched him plow into my fucking car and my, my white Porsche, the expensive one. And it's a rare car too. I'm like, fuck, I hope he didn't total the car. I got out and the first thing I said was, are you okay? And I go, I'm okay. We're cool. And I literally wasn't upset at all yet. I wasn't upset but I've been doing yoga like four days a week and I was a little high, you know, probably still from the afternoon. I think I was probably like, at least under the influence of cannabis to the point where I was like a little bit more. But

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       I just, I, I can only get there for like bursts when when you're busy with work and life and it can overwhelm and you get mad at someone doing a shitty job, parking, like come on, fuck, head punk, your car stupid. You know, like you backing up again, oh my God, look at this retard, let's get back up again. And um, and then I'll be like, I'll catch myself. Like, why not even talking to this guy, this guy's in a car 100 feet from me and I'm, I'm, I'm openly mocking him out loud. Yeah. And

Speaker 2:          00:06:25       eroding your insides as you do it. And I heard Wim Hoff talking about this. Maybe it was on your podcast and he was talking about being under the ice in his retinas froze and he couldn't find the hole to get out. And whoever was he was talking with asked him like, so, you know, what was the panic? Like what, what? And he said, well, you know, when I'm in those situations or like when I got lost in a whiteout on Mount Everest in my shorts, uh, there's no stress because then it's all just like, it takes you back to yourself to who you really are. And I know in my, in my core, I am like a competent and confident. And uh, so he was saying it's been demonstrated that you can generate more stress hormones laying in your bed and just thinking about something stressful than what actually happens when you're in a moment of actual danger. You sort of shift into another gear when that car hit you, that changed your whole world. Right? He's like, now now you're framing it as am I going to survive this? But I knew I was going to survive because he wasn't going that fast, but I was just taking. My car's going to be told you're watching him in the rear view mirror.

Speaker 4:          00:07:36       Yeah, I was stopped. And you know, people, Dude, some guy almost hit me today on his phone with his phone literally on the steering wheel as he's texting and driving and just went right into my lane. I think it's constant. People are constantly doing it. They're just not paying attention. And if something happens, when the guy rear ended me, the lane was closed for some reason like construction. So everybody had gotten to that, that onramp on Hollywood and or the one on one and highland exit and it was shut down for whatever reason. So we were all stopped at a big line and this dude just barely paid attention and then all of a sudden shit and I could see his face like gritting his teeth pulling fan. I'm watching my rear view tensing up, my car stalls out, goes flying into another lane

Speaker 2:          00:08:20       where you don't want to be on a motorcycle. Oh my God. Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah. That's so dangerous. If you get hit like that on a motorcycle who you might be paralyzed, you might be dead it easily and you can't get off and it's not your fault. That's the thing. And I rode a bike for seven and a half years and I always felt like I'm, I've got everything under control, but there's that, there's those tiles off if you have the time to jump off and get the fuck out of the way. Well I never, I wasn't like a competitive, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:08:49       dad and you see a guy coming from behind you. Do you jump off? You let it hit you? What the fuck do do? I don't

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       know, but you're hyper aware of all the space around you on a bike. So I'm always. If I'm stopped and I know like on a highway situation, I'm always watching behind me because you feel you developed that vulnerable sense. Scary man. Bikes back. Remember Bill Byrd

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       telling us what he has I guess at the Ice House. He's like riding a motorcycle is like, imagine sitting on the.

Speaker 2:          00:09:19       If your car driving that way. He looked down at the road buzzing by at 70 miles an hour and it's like I could reach out my toe and just grind it off, you know? Yeah. Yeah. But you know, but it's like, it's like a metaphor for so many other things in life, right? Do you really want to be set? You want to have the illusion of separation or do you. Are you actually safer being intimate with the danger of what's going on? So you're hypervigilant because in a car you're looking at your phone, you're fucking with the radio because you've got the sense that I'm in a room and everything's cool until he hit the tree, you know, there's definitely that you can definitely get to detach and as things get more and more automated, it's going to be weirder and weirder as a. Now you can tell your car things like, uh, like you've used that.

Speaker 2:          00:10:09       Hey, Siri function. Yes. You. So you asked your car to text people, text people, tell us to send less time. I was on your podcast. You did this whole thing and I saw a bunch of people tweeted, like, fucked up my phone off. They're listed in the fuck in the car because I'm like, how hard is it for you to press the button? All I have to do is press the button and then I say it, you know? Yeah. I don't have to uh, to say that do the Hey Siri thing. But my point being is they have the Tesla's now that they're coming with, they have a new download that allows you to have your car automate itself. Like you set the directions and it navigates drives. Yeah, it fucking drives itself. So like then it's gonna get real weird when we switched back and forth between that and then actual driving like the space out factor of people. Like when they have to drive again, they might not be used to it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       Yeah. It's the space between automation and like semi automation and full automation that is going to be really dangerous. But man, that dream as you leave your house, your car looks like a little living room, a little pod with a couch in it. Coffeemaker, a TV and you just sit on the couch, tell the car where it take me to vegas and it just takes you there and you just relax on the sleep. You can look out the window. The interstates are just going to look like houses. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:31       She miss you with your aviator. Sunglasses on the gloves hair. You driving gloves about driving shoes. Let's get crazy. Oh yeah. It was a little nervous driving shoes. That's shifting the gears. Let's say you have like a, an old Fiat or something. Cool. Will you look like you're a poet or something? Sure. I'm sure there are people back scarf over your shoulder. I'm sure there were a carriage drivers. Imagine, think of missing that last last. The horses back smell or the farts like everyone always. There's a nostalgia attached to antiquated technologies, but it's like, sure, great, but I'm going to be sitting in my pleasure pod with vr goggles on is I get taken to Florida. We're off the sacred river flows, which are missing the pleasure of the wooden wheel. Losing traction on the muddy road. Exactly the box, not aerodynamic box. Being dragged by horses starts to go sideways near the edge of the cliff.

Speaker 2:          00:12:37       What an adventure. What a great time to be alive, but I don't even have to ride the horse. I can ride in a box behind the horse. Not our technology is awesome. Progress being that box with fine silk like seeding. Everything would be made with pushup Bra. The core sets, the core sets lots of ruffled skirts. Fucking trying to bang a chick, one of those skirts. Which disaster. Okay. Then you've got to make a choice. Either you don't see her vagina or you don't see your face. It's one or the other. He can't have it both ways.

Speaker 2:          00:13:15       If you push that thing up, she's gone. Hold on. You know his citic Jews have sex through a sheet with a gun in it. My friend John Joke about it that the women used to look. Look at the clothes line. So you had the biggest hole, Jon Tobin. The thing. Think about that stuff man. Like who's the for like someone had to be the first person to be like, you know what? Let's put a big sheet over you and cut a hole right over your pussy so I don't see you anymore. Like that. Didn't evolve, didn't even touch it. It's not just a not see you that your bodies don't touch to. So someone invented that though, right? There was a person who's like, I've got an idea. Let's start putting the women in blankets and fucking a whole right. It doesn't evolve, right Chris? It's like there's a per.

Speaker 2:          00:14:09       There's one person who's incredibly crazy, I guess evolved, you know, it may have just been like a hankie over someone's face initially, you know, and then it grew. You can never know. It may have started as a blindfold, but you, it implies the communication about it. Like you have to tell your friends like, well, you know, I put a handkerchief over her face last night. Maybe you guys should start doing that with even crazier that it took off. It's not like one guy doing it like Hasidic Jews. It's a huge population of people in America. In New York City. There's a very big community of acidic Jews and they're all doing that with the blanket. I don't know if they do. I don't know the. And I think the women all shaved their heads and were widows to shave. I see it as an x, no makeup and no talking.

Speaker 2:          00:15:03       What the fuck? Damn team. They had to wear a wig. I think about it and the Arabs make them cover their hair right here. I think it's an expression of anti eroticism, anti pleasure, right? You're only going to have kids. There's no pleasure involved. So we're going to do as much as possible to remove everything that is in purely functional. You know, the thing that you're talking about, the Tesla thing. The thing is bizarre about that is in the fine print, it says it's in Beta. You went to your car, self driving car that's in Beta. It says that they're not responsible for any accident. So you should always watch the road and be prepared to step in if something goes wrong. Like, well thanks for nothing. Back in my computer making days. I used to have friends that would get the latest builds of software of um, um, operating systems rather.

Speaker 2:          00:15:53       And so they would run like Beta versions of like new windows operating systems and the shit was always crashing, but it was kind of half of the fun half. The Fun for those guys was like saying, hey man, I'm using windows nt, you know, Blah Blah Blah and this is the new shit and it's really only for server. So I have to have a workaround with certain drivers for video cards. You know, there's all this crazy shit they used to do. Remember though is like when you got windows, you had to get this giant pack of desks.

Speaker 2:          00:16:26       Sometimes you'd get two of these tubes filled with those things. Remember, you would start off with a floppy. You'd have to start out with a floppy that was like your install your foods that worked. The floppy was like, you'd stick that in and then you'd have to stick cd roms and like, what the fuck? All right. My first exposure to computers was when I worked in real estate in New York, in the diamond district full of Hasidic Jews. That's there you go. Uh, and uh, the guy had a computers the size of a refrigerator and one of my jobs was to backup the discs every week. And you'd pull out these drawers and put this thing down and turn it and pull it out. And the disc was about that big. You're showing your hands like an album a lot bigger than an album. Yeah. Like I'm large pizza, a large pizza that Herman Biggs was on that, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:17:13       I think it was megabytes. Oh my God. That's hilarious. This was 86 or so. That's so funny. It's so funny. Like the amount of storage space that we have now, it's kind of nuts and then also like that. So much of it is in the cloud. But if you'd noticed like on the new iphone software, you're doesn't download all your songs. It shows you all your songs, but when you go to play them it streams them. Yeah. I don't get that because I want the shit on my phone. So if I'm not connected or I don't have to pay for the data, it's my fucking state. I got 128 gigs on my phone, fill it with

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       music. I can't sit here and how to do it. Well you set it so that it's available offline and then you download all of them. You have to download all of them. It's super annoying. I didn't know hotel the other day. It's like now downloading 847 songs and I was like, what? The fuck, but you know when you're in a place that doesn't have cell phone service and you'd go to your music list. I was trying to use it in the gym. There was no service. It was like, Oh, you fuckers, it's not on my phone, and I had to figure it out. It's complaints back in the day. Yeah. It wasn't your complaint in the carriage and your fucking slippery right over the top of the mountain where you might wind up eating all your friends because you gets stuck up there. Crazy man that we are constantly surrounded by some cloud of invisible data that consists of all information that has ever been recorded.

Speaker 3:          00:18:40       That's crazy. Did you hear about that guy? That was. He went to see. He got shipwrecked at sea for like over a year with another guy and he made it by like drinking rain water, needing turtles and all kinds of crazy shit, but it's the nuttiest stories. They're kind of raft for a fucking year, but his companions family is now suing him because they say that he hates them. Yeah. He ate the other guy, the Mexican guy. The Mexican fisherman, they Mexican, I dunno, I dunno if they're Mexican, but just the thought behind it. Jim Probably stores just the thought behind it and banks sued. That's what's funny. It's cannibalism. It's on a criminal complaint. It's a civil suit. I don't know what it is because I don't know if it's American. I don't know if they have a different legal system. I don't even know what it is, but I don't even know if they're suing or if they're trying to accuse him out and murdering him or something.

Speaker 3:          00:19:34       Eating them. It's the eating that bothered, but if he's dead, eat him. Well, he said that's what I say. Eat me if I die, but what they say is that this guy shirt by the way, was claiming that he kept the dude on the boat with them for company for six days. Then throw them overboard. They sued for $1,000,000 for you, but here's the thing, like how they prove that he ain't. How do you even accuse a guy? I think he. He talked about it. He talked to me yet because he's Salvadorian, but they got. They were in Mexico and they got swept out that I've read about this one. So he talked about eating the guy. Yeah. So I think that's how the story says that he just threw the guy overboard. It seems like you would want your family member to have like given his life for somebody. It kind of makes your family member or a hero or lots of cultures. Ether did you know when someone dies they eat them. Yeah. And it's an honor that is incredible. More than a year and see, um, see if, uh, he admitted dreamy find it safe anywhere he admitted he paid this guy to accompany him on a short fishing trip off the coast of Mexico. Wow. Yeah. And he wrote a book. So they want the money from the book. Yeah. He might be right

Speaker 5:          00:20:49       or you might have ate that dude.

Speaker 6:          00:20:52       It looks like it looks like you need to do, you know, I used to think it. I think most people think some cultures were just cannibals for the hell of it, you know, like they were just especially evil, right. The aztecs or whatever. And then others just weren't, but you know, if you think about it, it doesn't make sense. So Europeans killed just as many people as the aztecs did. They were just as ruthless. They're burning them at the stake, you know, they even cook them, but they didn't need him. Right? Right. So then I read this guy, Marvin Harris, this anthropologist who wrote a book called Cannibals and kings. He went back and looked at societies that were cannibalistic and those that weren't, especially in the South Pacific because some islands worse. I'm islands weren't whatever. And in Latin America. And what he determined was that the societies that were cannibalistic had, um, a lack of protein, there were no animals that could be domesticated. And so when they killed people in battle, they ate them because they were protein hungry or starved. And. But Europeans had plenty of domesticated animals. So they didn't need the protein because they had the goats and the pigs and whatever. But if you think about Mexico, there's nothing that they could domesticate except turkeys or dogs or animals that eat the same food as humans. So you need to domesticate an animal that doesn't eat what humans eat, so it's not competing. Right. And there were not in in North America. So that's why they were cannibals.

Speaker 5:          00:22:14       Wow, that's crazy. That's fascinating. It. It's also important to note that I. One of the key tenants of Catholicism involves the kind of metaphysical cannibalism, which is, you know, at the, at the communion, the body of current body of Christ, and they call that conversion of the wafer into the flesh of Christ. They have a name. They think that when you're, when the priest is doing the ritual, it's turning it into the flesh of Jesus. The trends. Transubstantiation is the name for it, and that's where you're shifting the wafer into the flesh of a god that you're eating. But that's totally real. Oh, that's totally, totally real. You can taste it, but they get the right stuff. It's kosher. Many of them do think that that it is real. It's, it's Godflesh, which is actually a really old, that's a very old tradition, which is you eat, you eat a god, you eat the sacrifice God to get its energy or something. What high deval originated with entheogens? There's no, no doubt that at all.

Speaker 6:          00:23:13       Immediately what I thought of is the Amanita muscarinic where the psychoactive component stays active after it's metabolized. So the pis of the Shaman who's eating almond eaters, Scalia will get you high as shit. Yeah. I just saw they fed them piss

Speaker 5:          00:23:28       at that. Apparently Amany to Ms Dot Mascara is very hard to get. Right. I've never, I've never gotten hired off of it. I had, we tried it once, it didn't work, but then we tried siliciden mushrooms with it and we had a fucking insane journey so they might've worked together and sort of sort of synergistic way. But um, apparently by itself it's really hard and they think that it might be like a geographical variant like and then also like seasonally and then genetically like you have to get the right stuff and the right stuff might not even exist in most places anymore. Right. That's pretty interesting, isn't it? All that follow the last pharmacology they staff they will never even know about. Like a Soma Soma. Yeah. What is it like? What is this stuff you hear about this all the time? All of these old technologies that are just gone in the illusion mysteries.

Speaker 5:          00:24:20       I didn't realize this until recently. The Shamsi Lazy Lazy days or however you pronounce it in Paris. That's the illusion. Mushrooms, so it translates is illusion and mushrooms shops, right? Jumping Melanie's. There's unquestionably without a doubt. There were people that lived a long time ago, the discovered psychedelic plants they had to have and all. You have to just consider. I mean this is the most rational way to look at it. If you lived at that time and you had no science, you had some, some myths and fables and some rules to live by and you found those things, you would think that you had found God. You would definitely think if you, if you just ate, you don't have a scale. You're just eating these mushrooms that you find and you eat 10 grams of them could lord, you're going to meet God. You literally will be transported to God.

Speaker 5:          00:25:11       I never let you know. People will listen to this kind of shit and they'll go, oh man, that's so stupid. No, you're just tripping. He's just hallucinating. You got to take this into consideration. I know I've said it before, but it is important to repeat when you haven't experienced. It doesn't matter if that experience is like you could put a scale or hit it with a stick. It's a real experience. So you, even though you're no one's saying that you're meeting God when you do mushrooms, but what I am saying is it's the same thing as meeting God. Like the experience is so profound that you. It would be like doing that. It would be like having. When you do DMT, perfect example, it is like meeting the highest power around you. It's like meeting a god. It's like eating a sea of gods. It feels like there's a place where things can be both true and untrue.

Speaker 5:          00:26:04       I think you know, and and what you're talking about is that overlap for me. It's where, you know, like placebo effect. You say, well, it's just a sugar pill. Yeah, it's just a sugar pill, but it has demonstrable, measurable, repeatable effects on people. Hypnosis is another one, like wow, the fuck does that work? Nobody's explained this and, and I think when, when you're talking about seeing God, that is ultimately a subjective experience that happened or didn't and if it did, then it did. And there's no, there's no one from outside who can say, ah, it's just bullshit or that you know, some sort of Richard Dawkins denial of the sacred because you experienced

Speaker 6:          00:26:44       it. And so I'm sort of sympathetic. I mean, I trash religion as much as the next guy, but I'm sympathetic for the experience of someone who says, look, I go there, I have these rituals, I smell that stuff. I was raised in this tradition and I am transported to another world that makes my life better. I can't say that's not real despite the bullshit of the Bible or whatever.

Speaker 4:          00:27:07       Yeah. No, I agree with you. I, you know, I think is problematic. Is the label, like even how I said it, like you'll meet God like that. Just that word is so loaded. Right. That's, that's a big part of the problem, a big part of the problem with just the idea of religious religious ideas like forget about the words that you're using, whether you're using the word prayer or scripture or whatever the name you have for your deity. Those are just noise is you're making and they correspond to like whatever the cultural context is of the Hindu God or the Christian God, but if you just think of the feeling of wanting to be a good Christian, right? The feeling of wanting to please God. Not by billowing up abortion clinics or any. There's none of that. None of the wacky aspects of it that we sort of connect to it.

Speaker 4:          00:28:03       We think about like radical fundamental religion on any side of the fence, right? But with the feeling that you're getting, like you're feeling. If you're all together in church and you really are praising his name, you really are praising the idea of this loving God that wants fellowship and wants camaraderie and brotherhood. Like whatever that feeling is and whatever that thought is. Take out all the words, Jesus Christ and you know, praise Jesus and Buddha and Muhammad and Allah, and take out all those words and what is the feeling like that feeling is search for this positive, this positive source, like this thing that ultimately we can all eventually reach if we put aside all of our ridiculous monkey behavior and greed and jealousy and anger and lust and just get to us at our very best, you know, and it's almost like it's like a guide to get you there, but we get tripped up on the words that are attached to the guide, like the word God or the word Muhammad or the morgue. Allah or Krishna Krishna go down the line

Speaker 6:          00:29:10       and the fucking parasites that latch on to this and start selling shit. And you know, making a structure around the rules. Controlling people with Duncan started off talking about how you can recognize someone not just as a spiritually enlightened person, but as a just a person you want to hang out with. If they are really hard to offend, if they have a good sense of humor, if they don't have a sense of humor, there's something wrong, you know, and but you think about the Old Testament God, he's the most easily offended motherfucker imaginable. You know, like the book of job. If you ever read the book of job, it's fucking amazing. Like job is this great guy does everything he's supposed to do. Everything's cool and the devil and God are hanging out one day. And the devil's like that. God, the devil says like, people don't really like you so much, man. You know, you think everybody loves you. And God's like. Of course people love me. Look at job. He's perfect. He does everything I tell him. And the devil is like, yeah, but he only does what you tell him cause you've been good to him. Fuck with them a little bit and you'll see what happened. So God being the fucked up asshole that he is apparently killed job's wife and kids.

Speaker 1:          00:30:21       You know, that's not a, it's not meant to be taken literally though. I mean, that's not a literal, that's a. that's a story of the fact that, no,

Speaker 6:          00:30:28       God, Duncan, of course it's to be taken literally. You question what kind of truck driver, motherfucker. This is how cocky Duncan is dark and it's like, well, I think what Jesus really taught wasn't so good with his words back and since I've gone to college in North Carolina, he's got a phd. I had been talking to God, God gave me a phd, but no, I think that you run into trouble if you start looking at mythology and like is though. That's really what it means. I get to actually do it, but look at the god that's being depicted. There were, there was whatever the story is, he's easily, he's jealous, he's capricious, he's cruel, he's a fucking alcoholic father. But that's. So if you look at it,

Speaker 1:          00:31:15       the universe, like right now at this moment, mothers are dying of cancer, kids are getting exploded by bombs. All of it. Dogs are attacking fucking old people in the farm. Like, you know what I mean? So this is the story of job has always struck me more as a kind of like a story of how look man, you can't understand the infinite. Like when I step on an ant, you know what I mean? To me it's like, well I stepped on an ant today to it, but for whatever that aunt tiny little subjective universe happens to be, I've completely obliterated it. I wiped it out that and could never possibly understand the internet action that just happened there. But it was a real interaction. So it seems like the story of job is more like, what the fuck are you universe? This incredible thing that I'm surrounded by that seems to vary capriciously at random times just destroy people and lives and like, shit man.

Speaker 1:          00:32:11       I just heard about this family driving under an underpass and that like a bird, like a concrete block fell out of a truck, landed on the Goddamn Range Rover. Damn. Entire family zapped out of this universe. And to me job was. That's the stats, what the story is like how, how can someone be a servant of love? Like what you were talking about, how can someone connect to this desire to like give love and happiness and joy into the universe when it any second guaranteed for any human being there could be in there will be a tragedy, more devastating than anything you could ever imagine because that's just the way the world works. You're going to die. Your, your, your, your, your, your wife, your family, your friends. This is the reality we're in. And how in that kind of swirling vortex of chaos and violence, do you find a place where regardless of all of that, you will still be committed as much as you can, uh, to, to, to do that thing you did on the road when the fucking car hit here instead of getting out and fucking pummeling the guy because you're agenda, adrenaline's flowing.

Speaker 1:          00:33:18       You ask, Hey, are you all right? That's wild. I mean, to you it might seem like not that big a deal, but if everyone on planet earth started doing that, Whoa, Holy Shit. It'd be a whole new. Uh,

Speaker 6:          00:33:29       I think, I think, uh, I mean I agree with what you're saying, but I think there's an underlying is s assertion of the cruelty of the universe that I think is distorted. Okay. I think that, you know, I was watching this nature program a couple of weeks ago and there was a seal, I may have even talked with you about this last time when it was on, but there was like a seal playing in the waves and then you hear the like do, do, do, do, do and you see the shadow coming up and it's a great white and it hits the seal. And then they, the guy, the narrator actually says we slow this down to a one 40th of normal speed, right? And you see the teeth of the and the, and the seals flopping around and there's blood everywhere. And, and in the meanwhile the narrator saying the struggle for survival isn't ever over.

Speaker 6:          00:34:17       And so I'm watching that and I'm thinking, well, but seal seemed Kinda happy to me. Right? Like how come they're not more stressed out? Because all the seals I've seen relying on rocks and chilling, chilling, and bargain and having fun. So I looked up. This seal is a harbor seal. I think they lived to be about 30. So let's say this one's in its prime. It's 25. Okay. It's whole fucking life. It's been lying on warm rocks and eaten fresh fish. And then in half a second it's dead. Okay. And we're looking at that as evidence of the cruelty of nature. That what's the ratio there? You know, what's the ratio of good days to bad days? It seems like it's pretty fucking good. True. And I read this amazing account of being pounced on by Elian by, I think it was who searched for Livingston in, in Africa. I remember livings, Dr Livingston, I presume. Anyway, that guy, he got pants on by a lion and he talks about how he didn't describe it this way, but the endorphins that are released when you're dying, right? Especially in prey animals. And he was completely detached, completely relaxed. Watching this lion tossing him around. Well, they think there's an evolutionary advantage to both species, both the Predator and the prey in them having this endorphin release when they get got, because when, when lions

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       attack like antelopes or with big cats catch deer, the deer kind of given man, they get Jack, they nexia, but they don't. They kind of like fight a little and then they kind of give in, but like bears, like those kind of animals, they don't really give in like that, so they don't like if a, if a cat and a mountain lion or or or a mountain line rather than a bear go at it like the bear isn't just going to give in to the mountain lion. As the mountain lion bites the bear and it's neck, the bear is going to try to turn and bite them back and they're going to tooth and claw it out. They're not going to give wonder if he would give into a dinosaur. Whew. That's a good point. Something where the power is overwhelming and you feel it.

Speaker 1:          00:36:19       Like there's. I ain't getting out of this. If that. What triggers the release? That's a very good point. That thing that you're talking about right there is the secret of happiness, which is that fucking release because if you really look at it, man, we are in the mouth of a super predator. It's the entire universe and it's slowly killing us right now that it's true. It's like, I mean, it does sound like dire, but on one level it sounds dire, but then the idea is like you have to accept the situation that you're in and it is true. We are like being like we're in the mouth of the most incredible, most powerful, most omnipresent thing ever. We earlier when you were talking about, uh, you know, you smoked Dmt, you have this experience of God. You see God, whatever it is you have, you see this incredible matrix of consciousness or when you're on a per theoretically on Ios guy.

Speaker 1:          00:37:13       I haven't done it in mushrooms, but the funny thing about it is right now minus the Psychedelic, you are surrounded by an entire universe of which pieces of the universe are alive and aware of you and are talking to you, to psychedelics sorta just force feeds you that reality exactly, or it paints it to. It puts a different coat of paint on top of it, so now it seems unique novel again, but you, you. It's just another level of the same experiences happening, which is that you are surrounded by a living, partially living, a universe that has a tendency from time to time to produce life. This universe that we're in produces life and you're part of it and you're surrounded by an infinite ocean of that tendency, so that's very overwhelming I think for people, which is why they begin to accept that this was just completely normal. This thing, this, and then that's when you take the psychedelic and you're like, Holy Shit, I saw God. It's like, no. You saw the exact same thing that you've been seeing. It's only that you saw it in a different form. For whatever reason, people don't want to accept this stuff that's happening around us right now as God. They don't want to accept it. They don't accept that. What this thing is around us is super natural. It's crazy to see. This is what Joe was talking earlier, a

Speaker 6:          00:38:36       foragers finding these substances. I was thinking exactly what you're talking about because we take those substances and it's like a revelation and the veil is pulled back. What is the veil? The veil is culture. We live in a culture that is constantly trying to put out the fire of mystery in us. It's constantly saying, no life is about having this car, this kind of house. Get a new air conditioner, go to work. Don't, don't be looking for mystery. Just go to work and punch the fucking clock. All right, go work in your mind or your cubicle or whatever. It's trying, constantly trying to get us to accept this bum fucking deal, right? Whereas foragers, they're surrounded by mystery everyday, everyday everything's alive. Everything is full of spirit. There's the spirit of the river. The spirit of the clouds, the spirit of the air, they're surrounded by spirits, so I wonder what their experience with psychedelics is like because I don't think it has. I mean I'm sure it heightens everything and is amazing and obviously has as sacred value, but I don't think it has that same revelatory aspect

Speaker 4:          00:39:45       for regulatory thing because they're not confined to the bullshit of like buildings and streets and traffic lights and taxes and all these things that we hold in the forefront of our mind, our consciousness that are really just retarded. We've created these things. The most of the things that people come up with to occupy their mind during the day are things that we've come up with that we've discovered or be or created and be decided that there are significant tax laws or jobs or social status for breeding. I think.

Speaker 6:          00:40:16       I think it gets back to this point. I think the whole thing is an edifice built to distract ourselves from our mortality. I think that's what civilization is.

Speaker 4:          00:40:25       It certainly could be or it could be a mechanism for us to continue to create technology and innovate because the best way to do that is to not have a good perspective, not have not realized that if, if, if we, if our perspective is really good and we realized that we're these temporary beings who just love each other and spend as much time together in comradery and friendship as possible. We're not going to get shit done. We're all going to look at all the phones we have now and then go. We're good. We just keep using these phones and everyone's fine. We look at our tvs and that is a very big TV. We're good. My computer is super fast. We're good. My Internet seems fine. Let's just leave all this stuff alone and hang out. Right? That's right.

Speaker 6:          00:41:06       You need the discontent to create the technology. So the question is whose but, but whose interest is all of in that because it's not in ours. Yeah, exactly. It's the super organism.

Speaker 4:          00:41:18       Marshall Mcluhan, quote, Marshall Mcluhan's sex organs, and the machine was my favorite quote ever. And I think that one of the things we've done by lighting everything up also is we've gotten rid of the psychedelic vision that is space. You no longer

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       see space, uh, you have to, if you go on a trip to the desert and you go out to the desert in the high desert and you look up at night, you're like, wow, you get that majestic vision of the cosmos. We don't get it in la anymore. It's gone. It's gone. We smoked it out. We smoked it out with streetlights. When you got tomatoes, that'll look good for a long time but haven't been fucking flavor. Yeah. And roses that don't smell like roses, they don't what they smelled like nothing because because they've got to breathe that they will last much longer looking good. But it doesn't have the smell, but just spray perfume on them, Bro. That's what they do. Seriously. Seriously. That's what they spray rose perfume on roses. I went to dinner once. This French chick made me dinner. This beautiful, wonderful French woman.

Speaker 2:          00:42:21       And uh, but I didn't like anything she liked so it was a difficult relationship, you know, like she liked sailing, she had this little sailboat and for me sailing is like skin cancer, guaranteed skin cancer. Like I'm going to be a pale because I'm super pale. I'm out on the water, no shade, you know, we're waiting for wind, I'm dead, I'm dead. Anyway. So she made this dinner for me one night and I went to her place and everything was beautiful and it was all set up with candles and, you know, nice silver. And uh, it was escar go fucking eat escargot go man. I'm American. I don't eat snails, but I was going to go through it just because she went to all this trouble. Twenty eight, 29 something. And uh, so she has this big pot of escargo shells in the sauce tomato sauce and she puts it on her.

Speaker 2:          00:43:10       And so I pick up the first one and suck up the sauce and there's no snap and I'm like, lucked out. And uh, then it picked up the next one. Same thing again, no snail. And I'm looking at her across the table and she's getting this weird look on her face. There were no snails. She'd bought the shells. They sell the snail separately. You have to put the snails back in the shells. What? I don't know. Something about you spraying perfume on roses with no smell reminded me of that is so ridiculous. So she made a big pot of snail shell, snail shell suit tomatoes. Snail's shell suit. That's hard to say. Snail shell suit. Snail shells. Yeah. My mouth doesn't want to say that. Snare snail shell suit. Snail Shell. Snail snail. You're right. It is bizarre that they would separate them. Why would you take the snails out and make people put them back in maybe to clean them? Shipping. Yeah. Maybe a cleanliness issue. But then you would know that they weren't fresh. Like the whole idea is that you want to catch them and they do something to them. No, that's something that, uh, I was. There's a guy online who is a wild game cook, a famous wild game cook. And he's been on Steve Rinella, his television show. And one of the things he does is

Speaker 3:          00:44:33       he takes wild foods like mushrooms and stuff, and it incorporates than likely if he, if he eats like a deer, he cooks at deer meal, he'll use like a lot of the local ingredients like local plants and local mushrooms and things like that. And uh, he did that with some snails and he had to purge them. So I guess you do something where you take them and you like leave them in water for a long period of time or something. Like let them dedicate and let them pass. I think that that might be. That makes sense. Yeah. You don't want each snail pissed now. That's what you eat lobster, right? That. Hold down the last line we talked about fecal transplant. We have definitely. I haven't stopped talking about it. It's pretty bizarre. The idea that microbes from another person's poop can actually help your body. Yeah. That's pretty wild. High being born vaginally. You get your mother's microbiome all over your skin and in your mouth and stuff from her genital secretions. So when kids are born csection, they don't get that. They're much more likely to have asthma and all this stuff because they. So what you got to do, even if you have a c section, is smear pussy juice all over the kid's face. Literally. I don't think you should say that. We should probably edit that out. That's just what the doctor ordered. There are new rules, this society and your pussy juice anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:46:08       That'll get you fired. I think it was Yale, but over that. Sorry. We were talking about before the podcast started about the Social Justice Warrior placemats that Harvard had given to children to take home with them. And I say children because if your parents are paying for your education, your fucking child, you're still a child. I don't care what. I don't care what. I don't care if you're 18, I don't care if you could vote. I don't care if he can go to war. They, uh, they sent these placemats home with these kids explaining how to talk to your parents if controversial issues come up. Like if your parents exhibit xenophobia or sexism transphobia. And so they literally are there. They're giving them these placemats. Yeah. Yeah. We'll pull it up. The Harvard just apologize for it today for the place mat. Well, some intelligent people probably got ahold of him.

Speaker 3:          00:46:58       What the fuck are you doing? You're teaching people how to be only liberal progressive thinkers like think only the way you guys want them to think. Can they? Are they allowed to have a nuanced opinion on subjects that are controversial? Like there's some things you're not allowed to have a nuanced opinion about. You're not even allowed to debate it, and that was what happened at. Yeah, when they were talking about offensive Halloween costumes. Here it is the Yale student active tips for talking to family members. Oh my God. This is hilarious. Listen mindfully before a formula and

Speaker 5:          00:47:31       thoughtful response. When people express strong opinions, affirm, clarify the difference between the good intentions and the impact. Speak. Speak from a place of mutual interest, sharing personal experiences and emotions. Oh my God. And they talk about black murders in the streets. Why don't they just listened to the officer if they, if they just had obeyed the law, this wouldn't have happened. Response. Let me come on. Look at this, this hilarious. Do you think, do you think the response would be the same if it was a white person being pulled over, like look at what they're doing here. This is teaching people how to talk to their parents about controversial social issues like Islamophobia. Oh my God. What is this that we shouldn't let anyone in the US from Syria. We can't guarantee that terrorists won't infiltrate their. This is the worst fucking Christmas dinner ever.

Speaker 5:          00:48:26       Horrible. This is not the Christmas dinner. There's a fucking o'reilly factor. US has been accepting refugees from the war torn areas around the world for decades. Remember the wars in Central America? They were extremely violent in the US accepted refugees. All right. Whatever. It's just boring Yale student activism one. Why are the black students complaining? Shouldn't they be happy to be in college response? When I hear students expressing their experiences of racism on campus, I don't hear complaining. Instead, I hear young people uplifting is situation that I may not. You know what my dad's doing it at this point when I'm reading this, my dad will start making ozark start going.

Speaker 5:          00:49:14       By the way of lifting is not a fucking verb. Yeah. Know. Could somebody tell her fancy boys sign? You need to, but there's a harvard placemat. It's about the ell student, but look, listen, if non black students got the privilege, get the privilege of a safe environment, I believe that same privilege should be given to all students. Like you just said nothing. That is a nonsense statement. You don't hear them complaining when they're complaining. Well, that's bizarre. If people are complaining, they're definitely complaining. Very good. Exactly. There's nothing negative about complaining. They might have a very good point. If you don't hear complaining, then you're not paying attention. Black murder section. Now that is. That seems pretty logical. The response read it. Do you think their response would be the same if there was a white person being pulled over in many incidents that result in the death of a black body in the street? These victims are not breaking the law and are unarmed with Tamir seems right on. He was a 12 year old boy playing in the park. When the officers pulled up, they gave no verbal commands and shot within two seconds of arriving at the scene. He was not breaking any laws. You know this. It's just because I just watched someone made a youtube montage of cops shooting people. It's insane it

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       you've seen that. Yeah. It's crazy. And, and I was thinking my Christ man, if I was black and got pulled over by a cop, I'd be shitting myself. Oh yeah. Because they just shoot. Not only that, you're dealing with someone who is encountering bad people all day. Most of the people that cops and counter all day or breaking the law, most of the people that are either pulling them, pulling them over for going too fast or they're doing something stupid or they're trying to steal something and they're trying to rob somebody or they're showing up at a scene after someone's done something fucked up. Yeah. So just think about the stress that a normal person's under and multiply that times 100. You get paid like 40 grand a year. People want to shoot out. Yeah. You weren't a goddamn bulletproof vest and you're going to someone, someone's car and it's a young black guy and he doesn't use his rap. Music is loud. He's not even turning it down. You're like, God damn it is today. The day I get shot and killed, or I say the day I die

Speaker 2:          00:51:18       and let's not forget that a lot of these dudes are coming back from wars. So a lot of them have ptsd and they were trained where they were an occupying force. So they, they take that training and they apply it to joining the police force. And the population is the enemy. Everyone is a potential, uh, you know, it's a suicide vest.

Speaker 4:          00:51:36       I got into a conversation with my uber driver, this black dude, and he was like a talking about getting pulled over recently. And I told him, man, I haven't been pulled over and like, I don't know, nine years. And he's like,

Speaker 2:          00:51:49       what? I'm white lol.

Speaker 4:          00:51:55       He gets pulled over all the time, you know? And so like, that's fucked up man. Like that's like that, that to live in that kind of world where you realize that you're just, you just have to accept getting pulled over and you have to accept the fact that there is some chance if you make the wrong move or if the cops snaps because of for whatever reason you're dead. That happens all the time. There was that one where the cops pulled a guy over and there's a video of him, the completely different interaction. The cop described, the guy pulls his gun out. You could just shoots the guy in this fucking car. No one's in trouble knowing scared. No one's in danger. Terrible people

Speaker 2:          00:52:33       just shouldn't be cops. There's definitely people that shouldn't be cops. I think most people. How about that and what about these cases where they like swat the right into someone's house in the middle of the night and shoot them in bed and then it's like, oh, wrong house. Or they shoot a dog. They love shooting the dogs. Yeah, and taking the property. That's the other thing. This country, they're motivated. Motivated, motivated, motivated, motivated. Yeah. There's a word they're incentivized as far as two to get into shit, you know, to get, get into trouble, find trouble because they get the house, they get the car and there's, you know, in 2015 cops took more property than burglars did. Yeah, I saw that. Wait a minute and that goes right into the local police department's budget and he doesn't even go to Washington and they bought Margarita machines and the North Carolina to

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       see that. I didn't see that. They will pull them over and they just take it and say, well, you have to figure out a way to prove to us that this money was made illegal. The asset forfeiture surpass burglaries for the first time ever. That's crazy important point. You don't even have to be charged with the crime. They can just say, what are you doing walking around with 10 grand in cash and you have to. You've got to prove. And also think about how much of this is related to drugs and then so when you realize the asset forfeiture is actually happening for something that shouldn't be illegal anyway. Like do you watch, have you watched, it's called drunk tank. Have you seen this show where it's like, I dunno, it shows it's a show where after someone gets pulled over for a Dui, they get thrown in the drunk tank and man, there's to me, nothing more viral than seeing a cop smugly like searching a person and pulling marijuana out of his pocket and being like, well, well, well what do we have here?

Speaker 1:          00:54:23       Marrow wanna. Look at this. That's going to be something that history is going to judge in the most intense way. Every single cop that's been on a reality show, smugly taking someone's weed for them, putting handcuffs on them because they had weed for eternity, they're going to be looked back on in a really fucking awful way. They're going to want to scrub the Internet from some of that footage because they're enforcing a law that. I mean, we all preaching the choir here, but there's something so foul about it that smugness, you know, it's so disgusting for nothing, for nothing, for literally nothing. Literally nothing. No. Well, not less than nothing. Something they enjoy. It's not just for nothing, it's, it's more we're

Speaker 2:          00:55:09       discussing that because it's positive, it's beneficial, it enhances their life, it makes food taste better. Right. Well, that gets us back to the seeing God in a mushroom, right? Yeah. Every culture that's ever had access to hallucinogens have seen them as the greatest gift of the gods. Right? The most sacred, the most beautiful gifts they've been given in our country, in the United States. You go to prison for longer, under minimum. Mandatory for having a LSD. LSD. Yeah. Right. LSD. Then for second degree murder. Think about that. So it's not only wasteful and weird and awkward. Now it's the and and to me that, you know, ties into my argument that we live in a culture that it sets out to deny mystery. This is where I differ from you. I don't know the culture sets out to deny it or if all these things are kind of in place and they all benefit each other and the overall result is that the culture denies it's reality. I don't necessarily think there's any design involved. I know, well, see this is it designed versus evolution. I agree with you, I think it's a system that replicates itself and supports itself and spins out sub that support

Speaker 5:          00:56:23       the central mechanism. Yeah. I don't. I don't think Henry Kissinger's behind it know I. I know you don't, but I mean, I don't think there's anyone that doesn't want us. Anyone that doesn't want us to be aware of art. I just don't think anybody's attention entire advertising industry doesn't want us to know the reality of what they're selling. They're not even. Oh, that's different. Yeah. Okay. That's. They're trying. I mean there's a whole, you know, Edward Bernays, right? The Great. Yeah. The Guy who founded advertising essentially and also worked for the CIA also came up with the word defending freedom abroad, justification for American military adventures. I mean he was central and he very clearly said like, we need to create reality for people because if they are allowed to create their own reality, they won't buy stuff. They won't do what we need them to do.

Speaker 5:          00:57:12       They won't vote for who we need them to vote for. So there's an elite that has to create reality for the masses and it's logical. If you like, if we will, if we got assigned to and we are assholes and we got assigned to some massive group of people that we needed to control and we needed to, like we needed them to think that we were in charge. That was the first thing. You would have certain rules that you had that they had to abide by and the first rule would be don't let them take psychedelics man, because if they start fucking tripping, they're going to realize we're just three dudes just like listen to us anymore. Which is why I think there is a five year mandatory minimum when it comes to lsd because when you take Lsd, the entire thing seems absolutely absurd.

Speaker 5:          00:57:56       From money to the government to jobs at all seems like a ridiculous thing that everyone else seems to have accepted as like, yeah, this is just how you do shit. Right? But question, the people that are enforcing the laws are not the people that created those laws and the people that are enforcing the laws most certainly have not experienced these things. That's why we need to get comps tripping. Yeah, but you're right, I agree. I think that there's, there's a certain momentum that these laws and that this propaganda has sort of set in motion that's going to be really hard to slow down and stop and we're starting to do that with pot. The availability and the relaxation. The way people view pot in 2015 is way different than 2005 or two. I mean there's, there's a approved research going on, there's a fantastic clinical application, you know, and the old guard has to die. Well yeah, it works. You know, people that started those laws, the fucking Joe Friday's dragnet guys like those guys are dead. So like the people that like started this whole sweeping psychedelic legislation act of 1970, I believe it was when they made everything scheduled. Yeah. Were just trying to batten down the hatches. We have to stop these fucking hippies. Like everything was crazy. The response to Vietnam War, but he wanted to get out. It was, it was the culture

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       explosion that was going on and they were trying to throw a wet blankets on it. We're trying to figure out how to do it, but those people that did that, they're all dead. So these new sort of dea people in drug enforcement officers, they're there. They're operating under this assumption that what they're doing is in some way good because it's been in place for a long time and this is just how it is. And look, there's a reason why heroin is illegal, son. There's a reason why cocaine's illegal son, what? Marijuana is going to rot your brain. So you do marijuana. Like why are, why are mushrooms illegal? If you've done mushrooms, if you've done mushrooms and you think they're illegals, something went wrong, something went wrong. Either you tried to fight it and the trip took you sideways or you know, you didn't get enough of it or you did it with assholes.

Speaker 1:          01:00:07       If you were to have the, um, there's a thing you probably net, there's a name for it. When somebody gets invested into a religion or a cult, you get no called and after you've invested yourself for a certain amount of time, when you get really like sucked into the cult, uh, the, just the fact that you've been in it for four, five, 10, 15 years is enough to keep you in even though you know it's complete bullshit and see you stay in it only because like you've, you've invested too much energy. Like when they predict the apocalypse and then it doesn't happen, and those people just like, well, that doesn't shake their ego is completely committed to it. Imagine if like your entire life you had been enforcing legislation that was completely absurd, that wasn't based on anything, that in reality, that in fact for your entire life, you are a enforcing legislation that was in some way dampening or pushing your society back, pushing back the evolution of your culture and you have to come to terms with the fact that you did that.

Speaker 1:          01:01:09       You are an agent of the state and you enforced laws that shouldn't have been there at all. Man, that's a fucking tough pill to swallow. The fact that you may have killed some people use, there's people out there who have put bullets in, in people just for growing marijuana, something out of the ground or for being an Afghany adolescent, you know, I mean, think about all the soldier. That's what the PTSD is all about, right? They're coming back and they're like, what the f? I interviewed three vets on my show. I did sort of a series of interviews, tangentially speaking, available on itunes. Thank you. Uh, and you know, that's some of the stuff that comes up, you know, it's like fucking shoot people because you're there and that's what you do. And they moved and they had, you know, whatever. It's got to come to terms with it, you know, they just have to come to terms with it, but you have to come to terms with it because it's cowardly to continue to fucking enforce a goddamn thing. Even though you know that it's no longer a relevant. There's no need to do it. There never was a need to do it. You just have to take the bitter pill and go through a few fucking days of feeling guilty, you know, and understand that, that what you did was wrong. It's a real easy thing

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       to say, but the problem is until the laws get changed, it's not going to seem real to people that are still caught up in the haze of culture because culture has kind of a haze like you get. You get sucked into it and you're in it, and that's why people do different things in different places and it seems normal to them. And then we see it though what they eat with sticks, right? What are they? Fucking crazy, right? Well, they know about spoons. It's like culture becomes the norm. It becomes what you accept and right now our culture accepts the fact that you get locked up for drugs and you don't want your kids to be a druggie. You don't want your kid to be a loser if you, because they become potheads and become lazy. We have these thoughts that were really all the seeds were started in the 19 thirties with all those crazy reefer madness.

Speaker 4:          01:03:04       It just means it's the same stuff. It just has gotten less and less ridiculous, but no one, like even to this day, if you talk about getting high, talking about smoking pot, the vast majority of people look at it the same way as if you say, I got fucked up. I, we went and drank and I got hammered. I was so blasted. But there's a very big difference in what it's doing to your body. Like one of them is closing off awareness. One of them is opening up awareness and we're putting them in the same category and this is not a knock on alcoholic. I'm a fan of alcohol. Enjoy it, but it's a completely different experience. But when you explain it to people, they'll look at you the same way. Ah, you guys got stoned, Huh? You fucking crazy kids, you know. Meanwhile you got stoned and might have realized exactly what was wrong in your relationship and you know, and, and tried to fix your life and like wrote something down. It's going to be like the new chart, the new path of your destiny. Like more, you got drunk and shit. And your neighbors along because you try to be cute, you know, and this cat and it is cute. Put It on youtube

Speaker 1:          01:04:03       that we're talking. Is that cat fucking line a dig at me, man. No Man, no man promised who weren't going to talk about that. That, that thing you're talking about, man. That thing where you're like, well, well, well guess you're high right now. That's deep North Korean level conditioning. That's what it's no different than people in North Korea praying the dear leader. It's when you. You have been. If you, depending on how old you are, you have been a in a war. The war on drugs. It's a real war. It's a war where people have been killed and imprisoned and as part of all wars propaganda, you have to have private money and money, but you have been conditioned by some very intense brainwashing that was created by the CIA to try to control your mind. And so you have been infected with propaganda. If you think that drugs should be illegal, you are a victim of the drug war and another know another fucking casualty of the drug war.

Speaker 1:          01:04:58       Truth man, I was thinking like how much I lied to my mom. I was in high school taking Lsd, having these powerful life, changing experiences, beautiful experiences where I was realizing so much about society and myself and a lot of Shit I didn't understand and I would have loved to have talked to my mom about it, but I couldn't talk to my mom about it because if my mom found out I was doing fucking Lsd, she would freak out and parents, they go through their kid's drawers. They become agents of the state. They're digging through their kid's drawers to try to find a substance that has been on the planet for a very long time. Marijuana or a substance like lsd that is profoundly beneficial to a person who takes it and the right way and they've become agents of the state and they're. They're forcing this in their house, in the home, which should be a place of absolute truth and trust and acceptance and growth.

Speaker 1:          01:05:57       It's been transformed into this kind of Weird Gulag. It's been turned into this bizarre prison place where the parents somehow have got to enforce these absolutely arbitrary laws and that I can't, I don't think that anyone is ever going to be able to calculate how much damage that is done to society that we have placed our teens into a position where they have to fucking lie to their parents about having the most profound experience accessible via chemicals. But there's a lot of people that think that you shouldn't fuck with any entheogens, any psychedelics while you're a, you have a young developing mind. Well, I'm not one of them when I can't, I can't be. I didn't do all that all through high school and I absolutely am so grateful to that. I'm so grateful for the information stream because I didn't have the Internet man and like, uh, you know, my encounter with a, what lsd was, was through pure government propaganda.

Speaker 1:          01:06:56       Like it was like finding books where it talks about Timothy leary is an insane lunatic who lost his mind, uh, that paints a picture of people who were advocates of the psychedelic experience as being some kind of evil drug addled lunatics as opposed to being what they really are, which is rebels and heroes and a completely insane a war that has destroyed countless lives. So I didn't, I wasn't able to like go on the Internet and look this shit up and find out that indeed this experience that I'm having, which appears to be beneficial is truly beneficial to a great many people. All I had was bullshit. Like you're gonna, you know, if you take five hits of acid, you're legally insane. Or the old classic image show to take five. So I'm covered if I do something good clover, same lost my mind. So I'm going to do, I'm going to talk like from the 1940 [inaudible] from now on the fly. I'm in saying, what do you mean by this beneficial experience? Well, it's sad, you know, it really is. And it's what's really sad about is like other wars, the casualties, you know, we build walls with names on them and other wars, but in this particular war, so many people who were just farmers

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       and alchemists are laying in their graves and nobody realizes that these were heroes. These were people who were in the face of insanity, making the decision that regardless of what the state was telling them to do, that we're going to follow their hearts. And a lot of them went to jail for a lot of them are in jail for political prisoners. That's the word. That's it. This is very strange how hard it is for us to break momentum of habit. And that's part of what's going on is there's a momentum of habit that looks at all these things as being negative. Well, and there's a governmental system that's supremely unresponsive to new ideas, right? Because of the way Congress has set up. But one of the things is changing that I think is what's happening in Colorado with the tax revenue in Oregon in Oregon.

Speaker 2:          01:08:59       But Colorado has a longer history of it right now. They've made more money for the first time ever from marijuana and taxes than they do alcohol and crime goes down. Crime went down, drunk driving, went down, crime went down to record levels. Drunk driving when real estate went up, 13 percent. Prescription overdoses down because people are using marijuana for pain control and tourism up hot girl moving in part and time. There's negatives to hippies freaks a lot of lazy bitches moving into lot of hippies. Attracted like metal filings. I slept and Terence Mckenna's bed the other night. Well, just jerk off. I felt it. No, no. Shut up. No beautiful. Whereas Terence Mckenna is. It's a bed he slept in often in mill valley. Oh yeah. That's awesome. I always wanted to buy his house in the Big Island, but it burnt down. Burned down with like thousands of books. Yeah. Yeah. How the fuck does a house burn and Hawaiian rain forest. He lived in a rain forest. Volcanic eruption? Yeah. It's called girlfriend with kerosene.

Speaker 2:          01:10:12       You guys know I'm a nominated for porn award, so I tell you that a porn awards nav. An award. Wow. Okay. So good. Yeah. Best non sex scene in a movie. What movie was this? It's called marriage. Two point. Oh, and A. I'm up. I'm up against Ron. Jeremy. Dick tribbles. Yeah. That's broken. Has nothing to say. Congratulations for given some amazing. I hope you win. Well. I was going to ask you if you guys would go to Vegas and accepted on my behalf. Send Red Band. He'll be there anyway. Get it for us. Yeah. I, um, those things just seem like too much sadness for a guy with daughters of the avn awards and just definitely. Maybe, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's a party. Brian says it's all like a cam girls now. That's like the majority of what it is. I think there is.

Speaker 2:          01:11:10       I just read about this documentary about the shift in pornography that like the way that pornography's, that that industry is kind of disintegrating because of the Internet toll free. One of the many fucking disrupt the Internet is disrupting everything. Man Isn't from Warren to taxi cabs to everything is getting reconfigured by it. It's so fascinating. It's unbelievable. It's a very weird time. Not just taxi cabs. I told you, rental cars, the skirt rental car company to just drop your rental car off and then they pick it up later like they bring it to you, sort of like uber for rental cars so they could just get a sofa in there. We'd be in Duncan's future, some sort of a pod. I always thought they should make cars with cameras. Right, and so you actually sit backwards in the car and look at a screen that's projected of what's in front of you and you drive backwards because you think about if you're in a collision, you're, you're good. If you're driving backwards, not really. You're fucked if you're going to get crushed, crushed, and it's not good to not know when you're impacting. Well, you would know as far as your. It's like a virtual. It's as if you're looking out the windshield, but you're actually shifted backwards and it's cameras projecting on the screen. My brain hurts and probably throw up constantly. That would be weird.

Speaker 2:          01:12:35       I just feel like you wouldn't want to see the car coming at you rear ending. You don't know. Yeah, you wouldn't because you'd be closed, man. Did you see that at the video of Ilan mosque finally landing a rocket fucking cool man. Oh yeah, it's bad ass. It's just like straight out of like old 50 Saifai. It's like exactly the same thing. He did it. He landed a rocket and that guy I heard that he is part of a, uh, him and some other people have said that they're going to give a billion dollars to create a new artificial intelligence research research center or something because they're terrified. Elon Musk and the gunny in England, the Stephen Hawking you through the gun, like weird that it's fun. Oh yes. They're terrified. And they're, they're, yeah, they're really. How do you feel about artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence? It's very rare. You have a right to the phone. I'll check my texts. Give me your thoughts on this idea. A hundred percent. What I did just busted both of us like my impression of a, but you can't help them fucking things or heroin. They pull you. Just want to check. Maybe the next tweet is going to be amazing. Do someone's going to send me the coolest part of in my life to

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       read it and I'm just going to learn. But do you read articles? I, I find I store them. I'm like a fucking squirrel and October man, I got so many tabs open and so many things in evernote to read later. I'll never read all this style, but I've got this acquisitive thing like, oh, that'll be interesting. I'll save that. That old. I don't know. They'll go there and that and it's just a mess. It's a massive. I'm like a hoarder. I'm an intellectual hoarder.

Speaker 1:          01:14:36       I try to practice mindfulness when I'm going through my phone so I kind of watch myself as I'm doing it because I know I'm addicted and I can see what I'm in is at really awful pattern and it's like when, when you, when you go through it and you analyze what's happening, you, you, you see that it is a form of drug, you see that you are getting like little hits off of it. You are getting like weird little like moments of like strange information intoxication. Like you get these little white uptake. So like when you find a particularly like, oh shit, a fucking vice documentary on the liberation of the city in Iraq. Whoa, there's a cat eating a fucking man's leg. Holy Shit. Uptake, uptake, uptake. You're getting these like weird little hits and it's kind of cool and it keeps you stuck in a cycle.

Speaker 1:          01:15:24       But that pull you're talking about, man, I had this like a awesome goth friend who was into like, God, I can't remember if it's the, there's a differentiation between death metal and black metal and I always get in trouble for mixing them up. But like he was like explaining to me about a vlog vagueness burzum. I always get in trouble. I get the whole story mixed up. But basically it was explaining how these guys are actually burning down churches and they were really hard core man. So he plays this a burson, this death metal for me. He's like, listen, I was super stoned. He's like, listen, listen. I'm listening to what he's like. Do you feel the pull? It's like, shit man, I do a little bit. I know what you're talking about. It's got a weird dark little gravity to it that if I'm allowed it to, I could see how I would start getting more and more and more into it. It's the same with these fucking phones,

Speaker 5:          01:16:15       man. They have a true, a weird, magnetic, subjective magnetism where you always feel it's almost a physical feeling, man. I'm like, you almost feel it. Pulling your attention towards it. They're like black holes for attention. It's interactive. That's the big factor. The big factor. It's interactive. You Click on things, you can make things happen. You can open things. Look at pictures. It's one of the things that people like about instagram. You're. You're clicking on it and go, oh, look at that picture. Look at this picture. Oh, I'm going to comment and you're interacting, not interacting. It's like some bizarre introduction to a new type of society. It's this is. This is. These are the first steps, these social media steps. These are the first steps. This new type of integrated communication that we're experiencing. Yeah, but like we were talking about what the city. The city separates us from the realization that we are just temporary beings collecting things needlessly because we're only gonna be for a short amount of time,

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       but yet we spend all of our focus trying to accumulate the largest pile of shit before we die. That's sort of the same thing is going on with phones. It's the same thing that's going on with everything. It's like it's solely that pulling us into it's trance and the more we feed into it, the more we work hard, the more they'll make more of these, the more they'll make better ones of these. The more these things will deeper and deeper integrate themselves into your life until the point where they're symbiotic until the point where the new google contact lens. Have you seen that shit? Google's coming out with a contact lens. New goddamn contact lens is going to be Google glass. The contact lens. It's going to be able to tell your blood sugar if you're diabetic. Oh, project two and everything. Oh, you can see shit on it.

Speaker 4:          01:17:53       It's going to do everything we can to have like porn going in your left eye. Twenty four slash seven and you're right, I porn your left. I threw my people see it, people see and I think it's just a matter of time and it's a matter of time before they create eyes that are better than these eyes. These eyes that we have that I need reading glasses now to read things that are fine print. I can't like, I can't read a book anymore. I have to have a pair of glasses. I'm reading a book about how to strengthen your eyes when I wear reading glasses. When I read the book. It's hilarious. And you know that the Myopia is out of control and they say it's because kids are indoors all the time. I think it probably has a lot of screens. A woman named Katie Bowman, Katy Katy Bowman was on the show and one of the way she described it as a cast, she said, if you're, if you're always looking at something that's the same.

Speaker 4:          01:18:50       It was Katy Bowman, right? They product this up, pretty sure. Um, she was saying if you're always looking at a certain distance in a certain space, then that becomes like a cast, so if you put your arm in a cast and the muscle atrophies, but when you are outside like a normal person, as you're looking at things that are close, you're looking at things that are far away and it doesn't distort your lens when you're staring at a screen all the time, which I am all the time either doing a podcast or going online or whatever that fucks with your eyes. That's why you know, people who would read all the time, we'd get glasses and people would correlate it like, oh, I fucked up his eyes from reading. He would always say that. And then they said, oh, that's bullshit, but don't say I'm white or some bullshit.

Speaker 4:          01:19:29       If you read enough, you're looking at that space, has it right in front of you. Only something really close up, but it fucks with your eyes yet. And also masturbation makes you go blind. No, no, no, that's true, right? No, none. If you use your left hand that you just need balance. It's all about balance. You need, um, he bounced, but this is this thing you're talking about, aren't they? Finding out that there's actually something about that, like the energy being radiated from the things at night. Like it fucks with your sleep cycle to like, oh yeah, the blue, the blue wavelengths. So get, get f Dot Lux, Lux. It's great. In fact, I

Speaker 2:          01:20:07       just interviewed a sleep scientist, uh, two days ago in San Francisco. Really interesting guy does research at Stanford, Dan Pardi and we were talking about that. It's the, it's the, the blue end of the wavelength, which is what you get from sunlight, affects the centers of your brain that Sorta tell you what time it is in your circadian rhythm and all that. So as you get toward a evening, you want the light to glow more and more gold, yellow and eliminate the blue. So this app just automatically filters your screen based upon where you are and what time it is. And it's, it's good. It helps with the sleep because if you're looking at blue light right before you go to bed, your brain thinks you're in the midday, you know? That makes sense. So plain plane that they're doing, they're creating this new plane, they're going to make it out of carbon fiber and they're going to adjust the light in the plane to match the light in the area you're going so that your circadian rhythms don't get interrupted. No windows and apparently in doing this, somehow or another, they're going to eliminate the type of jet lag that a lot of people suffer from. Yeah, because by the time you arrive, you're already calibrated. Yeah. I don't know how the fuck they're doing that. It doesn't make any sense to me. I've 16 hour flights. You know, I've seen this. I heard about this new kind of a light that they have that you can put in basements that somehow perfectly replicates sunlight so that it's, ah, I don't know. It's amazing because you can grow weed.

Speaker 3:          01:21:38       No, it's not heard of those two. Have you heard of it? I get some places growing tomatoes. Fucking go down Ventura Boulevard and there's like 15 different stores selling you indoor tomato growing supplies. Fuck, I just think that's what it was like. Shit. Yeah. There's a lot of indoor farmer's. Another heirloom specialists. Well, did you hear about the a former FBI agents whose house got broken down? They broke down the door. Cea, a dea agents. I think they shot their dog. I don't know that they loved sheepdogs. You. It's in the constitution, arrested them and then found out that they were just really grown tomatoes. They literally were growing tomatoes, so these people were for agents. These guys were retired agents to try to grow some vegetables, make a nice salad. They got a fucking gun to their bad Karma. Karma. Karma in that at least if not Karma. There's a recognition of the system that you participated in for most of your adult life. There's your career. Here's what you did. You Fed this machine and machine that's looking for too much electricity and using your basement, which could be indicative of plant growth. Plant growth in your house while you fucker. You're probably a criminal time to kick your door in with guns, but dammit, we talk about this all the time, but if you really let yourself accept the fact that right now at this moment, flying over neighborhoods or high

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       tech helicopters scanning the third, the radiation from the houses to find out if inside their growing plants that aren't accepted by the state. That's really weird man. And that's why I'm leaving. I'm going back to Spain where they don't do that shit. They don't do that. Don't do Portland neither though, Dude. You say Portland. Don't have the resources. Go to Eugene. I could definitely not do it. It's nice. But you've seen the new um, radar that they have now would, they can hook deepened or x Ray? They look deep into your house. They can look in your house and see or silhouettes as you. So you can watch people fuck. Like they could look through this screen and literally see you inside your house blinds drawn, banging your wife on the bed. But who wants to see two skeletons? Fucking. I really, really love it.

Speaker 5:          01:23:55       Why not? I don't think it's just. I think it's like a, I think you could see images like you could see the outside of the body as well. It's not just as simple as like you see the scallops actually, you'll see. I'm sure they'll figure out a way that to interpolate whatever data they're gathering and turn it into something that isn't shadows, it's just a matter of time and it's a matter of time. Any technology that is being controlled by the state, uh, because it's too expensive for normal people to obtain eventually more than likely will become less and less expensive and everyone will have it. So if right now there is some, some insane technology that people are using to look through walls and see shadows, fuck. Then it's at what, 10, 15 years before it's going to be something that you could just order or something that you can download on your super sophisticated drones for Christmas is using mobile x Ray Vance to spy on unknown targets.

Speaker 5:          01:24:47       Patrol was a friend of mine used to work for the company who makes those. And what they were doing was they were scanning container ships coming in and out of the country are coming into the country so they could look for drugs without opening up the containers. Look what this says. Stop right there for a second. New York City won't reveal how often cops bombard places, vehicles, or people with radiation, or if there are health risks for residents, they won't reveal it. If you don't talk about the technology was used in Afghanistan before and b being loosed on us streets. Each x Ray van cost an estimated $729,000 to $825,000. It's a big fucking difference. I will not talk about anything at all about this New York police commissioner. Bill Bratton until you paid for it. Wow. How's that going to the range of security and counterterrorism activity that we engage in added. They're not used to scan people for weapon, but you know what's hilarious? They've used the terrorists acts like various terrorist acts all across the world to catch people selling drugs. Because you could sell drugs as an act of terror that falls under financing. They pay, they just pass some new Patriot Act, you know that right now the new Patriot Act that was quietly, secretly past. Is that the CIA,

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       NSA, whatever the fuck it is,

Speaker 1:          01:26:08       where, where Obama said I'm going to watch star wars. And he apparently just sign this demonic thing and that. Yeah, it's scary.

Speaker 2:          01:26:15       Well, this, I mean they, there's a lot of leeway now for what they can and can't spy on you for what they decide to look into your life for. So let me, if we follow up what you were saying about how something controlled by the state, you know, it gets miniaturized and cheaper and eventually becomes available to everyone if we apply that. Same thing to weaponry. I've been thinking about this for a long time. Nukes are getting smaller and smaller. They've got suitcase nukes now, John. Yeah. Much more convenient. It's so annoying. Yeah. But pack nuke. I'm tired of suitcases. Right? So are we going to come to the point where any terrorist group, so called terrorist group, and I use that word in air quotes, can have access to these things. What's that going to mean to world politics? Are we going to come to a point?

Speaker 2:          01:27:04       Kind of like everyone in Switzerland has guns. You know that this philosophy, if everyone had guns, everyone would show out and be nice to each other. Are we going to come to that point internationally where if people are aggrieved enough, they can really fuck up the game and so then the attention will shift to not having people so aggrieved because right now we don't give a fuck, right? We'll go blow them up. If they're. If they're that pissed off, they're going to come for us, then we'll send drones and kill them all, but if they could come for us with a speedboat and nukes, is that a game changer or do you think the whole thing just shifts to another level and us have to address the root of the problem? If it was that accessible. Now it's like the ultimate statement of an armed society is a polite society. Yeah. It's almost like the ultimate expression of that, like in a well armed nuclear society has fucking super polite. Imagine, knock on your neighbor's door and tell him his dogs barking too loud when he's wearing a fucking nuke vest. Flow up the way you saying my dog is making too much noise. Okay. Fuck it man. I want to take care of them. Do you want the dog? I'm going to hit this button. Let's just do this. I'm going to wipe out the whole block. No Man. What? What you're talking about. I,

Speaker 1:          01:28:13       I did an interview up a very good point. I didn't interview at Singularity University in, in any, in. He brought up this exact thing any, any and and which is that, you know, he was explaining it in terms of bio weapons that people are creating these like apparently are like fucking around with genes in their, in their, in their garages. And then you were saying like things like the ability to launch satellites and just about anything you can imagine. He's what he said, and I, I think he may have, I mean, I don't know. He didn't say he was exaggerating when you said we're looking at if technology continues to accelerate as it is, we're looking at a point in human history where anybody, if they wanted to, could destroy the entire, are caused massive damage. And so, uh, you think to yourself, all right, well, let's imagine that that was the case.

Speaker 1:          01:29:09       And somehow by some miracle, every government of the world suddenly figured out a way to address everybody's personal issues. There was still going to be one or two more likely a thousand people who are like, no, that's cool man. But I think I'm going to detonate this nuclear bomb that I created in my three d printer, getting from fucking, who knows how. I mean, it's a big question mark or something even worse than that. So this thing, what you're talking about, I think is the, uh, that awful race, Terence Mckenna talks about that we're in, which is that here we have this race between absolute destruction and some kind of via tech technology that doesn't even exist yet. And some kind of Utopian awakening. I know this kind of stuff probably makes you want to punch me, but I want hug you. It's ridiculous. But, but, but, but these are these two, you know, these are these two races that are happening right now.

Speaker 1:          01:30:07       One of them is without question, technology is going to get to the point where every single human has access to some kind of device, more powerful than any other human in the past ever had access to. And the question is, is that gonna happen before some other form of technology emerges that makes us all unifying to one organism or some beautiful thing happens. I mean, it's a pretty terrifying. It's a terrifying relay race man. It really is. It's a tear. It's not really, it's a terrifying race. And um, but isn't that kind of always, always

Speaker 4:          01:30:45       the case? Like we need some sort of a problem to overcome it. We need competition. We need the Yin and the Yang. We need a dark and a light. We need the, you know, we need to tide. We need like a cycle. It's almost like we need this resistance of like us building towards this, this technological singularity almost. It's going to be in your fucking iphone and everyone's going to have the ability and well, we have to fix humanity in order to have this happen. The only way that we're going to survive, we fixed humanity and so, you know what I've been thinking, it's just something I'd never talked to him economists about this, but in my own stupid head, um, I think we're going to run into a bottleneck with technology and I think one of the big bottlenecks is technology is all about access to information, right?

Speaker 4:          01:31:31       Technology like as far as what's going on, it's like your, your ability to do things, whether it's to project images on screens or to download things faster or to number crunch cruncher, the various different things that technology can do. But what we're using, the way we're using it today was a big factor is the ability to exchange information and the access to information and the access to each other. And it seems like it's getting closer and closer and closer. Right? Access is getting quicker. It's more information, it's easier to get to the boundaries between people are getting smaller and smaller. What's the bottleneck? Bottleneck is going to be money and money is ones and Zeros. That's what money is. Money, right? If of all, ultimately all information becomes available to all people at all times. That's ultimate enlightenment, right? Instantaneous information constantly available to everyone.

Speaker 4:          01:32:19       Well, isn't money information now because money's not sacks or old. You're not talking about, you know, I've got. I've got 15 bushels or gold. How many of you got when you know? No, we're talking about some weird ones and Zeros and plastic that makes these ones and Zeros transfer your magnetic strip. You slide on the machine. You Punch in your numbers is not real anymore. It's information and in transferring our money to inflammation, the bottleneck is going to be money. We're going to come to this ultimate point where we realized, look, we can't protect money anymore. We can't. You can't say this has duncan's money. This is Christmas money because it's going to be just mine. It's going to be just money and I mean maybe there'll be some sort of a merit based system where you can have access to money or use money and we'll have to figure out some sort of a way around it, but it'll have to be some sort of like ethical thing that we all agree on.

Speaker 4:          01:33:11       If I'm looking at it correctly and I'm looking at all of this, these trends that lead to quicker and quicker access to information, more and more availability of that information, access to information becoming universal. Well, what's the money? Money. Money is information. It's ones and Zeros. It's all it is. Well, how are you going to stop it if that's the trend of the trend ultimately becomes instantaneous. Constant access to all information for everybody knows secrets. None exist anymore. They don't exist. I could read your email. You can read mine. We're all communicating with each other. That's it. There's no more secrets. How does money fit in there? Unless we go back to fucking collecting clam shells and putting them on strings and this is a. This is my company, not so I have a mushroom. That's what I'm used to it. We're going to have silver coins and shit.

Speaker 5:          01:33:54       What are we going to do? But. But I would question the premise that money ever was real.

Speaker 5:          01:34:00       You seem to be saying that we're reaching a point where it will no longer be real like bushels of gold. That's just symbolic too. I don't think money ever was anything more than agreement between people that we're all going to pretend this is real. It's true, right? Because it it locally. Your money is different than someone in Greece. You, you mean you go with your money there. There's some sort of exchange. You have to make an agreement. Do you accept my money will accept your money, but it's not really worth a dollar. How much is it worth over here? Seventy five cents, God dammit, but last month it was a dollar 25. Well Times have changed. We don't like your money as much anymore and they make deals. Our central bank who's staffed by people we don't know. I mean, there's a lot of mystery at the heart of it is to be able to go to Canada and it was Canada and it was awesome. We do Montreal and you'd get like a dollar 50 for a dollar, something like that, and it was amazing. Like food would be cheaper, everything will be cheaper. Like, ah, your money goes a long way in Canada. And then it shifted and then the Canadians would come to America because the money would go a long way here. Money was worth more than ours.

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       Have you ever heard of Grant Morrison? Yeah. Do you know Graham? You should have them on the show, man. He's just refresh my memory. Grant Morrison is that he writes a bunch of incredible comic books. One of them I'm super into right now, graphic novels called the, uh, the invisibles, but he's really smart. There's a, there's a grant morrison lecture, a descent. He was like at a disinfecting gathering and he gives this really cool lecture or a talk. And one of the things he said is that the super elite, they have gone back to a barter economy because money doesn't mean anything to you if you have billions and billions and billions of dollars. So the normal way to get someone to do something is to say, okay, I'll give you x dollars for you to do this thing. But if you've got infinite money and someone asks you to do something to give you more money to add to your infinite pool of money, it's not an incentive anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:35:47       You're not incentivized by money. So it's more like, what can you do? For me what it's like a, it's a. It goes back to some kind of weird, maybe you're going to barter power, maybe you're going to barter some access or something like that, but money is irrelevant to the super elite. Money only means something to people who are in the lower and middle class. Once you have an infinite amount of this shit, it's completely an absolutely irrelevant, which is what you're saying. Everything then theoretically would have to go back to some weird barter economy where

Speaker 5:          01:36:17       would never going to reach a point of ultimate resources where everyone has the same access to things at the super elite does because there's just not enough.

Speaker 1:          01:36:24       Well, this is where you get into like this is where you get into the idea of experienced generation. You know like if we get to like Google this thing, you're talking about Google contact lenses, it's not going to stop at the right. Technology is doing the thing to us that the fucking face suckers on aliens do. It started off far away. It was our phones. It was our computers than it like a. It was on our desks. It was a nice safe distance. Then it got into our pockets. It tried to climb onto our face with the google glasses, but nobody liked that. But now it's getting into our eyes and it's not gonna stop at our eyes. Technology's gonna, merge with our consciousness and when it merges with our consciousness, the theory would be that it could somehow create experiences that were indistinguishable from reality, which means that really what's the difference? There is no more. You can't like. You know what? We're already using bionic parts on people, right? Sure. Hips,

Speaker 5:          01:37:24       yeah. Yeah. All sorts of stuff. My wife has ocular implants. She has lenses surgically implanted in her eyes. Yeah. This is. I mean, this is not new stuff. They're doing artificial knees. They're doing artificial hips and how long is it gonna be before someone comes along and says, listen, dumped. You have two choices. You can either wear glasses, you have 2,400 vision and you know we have classes for you. Didn't. That's fine if you enjoy it or is a really simple procedure. Takes five minutes. We were placed your eyeball with an artificial. You don't feel any

Speaker 6:          01:37:56       pain, but you'll have to put up with ads every 60 seconds. Well, you can click that ad. You can click the ad. You just reach up. You've touched. This is what. What's the name of that that thought experiment about the ship? Somebody ship, you know, the one where it's like, it's like the idea is like at a sailor is sailing across the ocean and the mast, he needs to replace the mast until we replaced the mast and then he replaces, I can't remember his name. The different shifts, different by the time it gets there, it's all new parts, but it's still his ship. So it's like with the, with technology, it's the same thing. Like what if we keep replacing our spirit is the ship of theseus. That's it. Yeah. So yeah, the idea is like when is, when do we, when, when, what is humanity or when do we stop being human?

Speaker 6:          01:38:44       The whole idea about downloading consciousness, right? Way To put consciousness into a computer. And how do you know when you've done it? Like how do you know what consciousness is? I mean his consciousness inexorably attached to your physical being or is consciousness something that's out there that you're just, you're, you're, you're consciousness is riding around this meat wagon. Is that what's going on? We don't. There's no agreement on that. Also, we need to define what we mean by human because I would argue that we've already left human experience and we're already well into something else. What would you call it that we're into? Um, I equate it to do. You might know this, that every locust starts off as a grasshopper. And what happens is there's this, uh, particular, uh, the best example is in North Africa. It's this species of grasshopper that when the density of the population density gets tight, sufficiently tight, there's a trigger point and different genes are triggered and activated in the, in the body, the preexisting gene.

Speaker 6:          01:39:47       So it's the same DNA, but it changes the shape of the head, changes the legs, changes the coloration, and changes the behavior. And that's when they become locusts swarm. And so I think that humans are like the grasshopper locusts. And I think that with agriculture we became locus and started swarming and we're willing to swarm behavior at this point. And so for the sake of argument, I would say human, the way I would define it is hunter gatherer, which is 95 plus percent of our time on the planet. That's human behavior and what we are now is shifted into this other, you could say artificial. You could just say emergent behavior pattern that conflicts with our grasshopper illness. Right? And that we're suffering from. That's what this latest book is about. And so, you know, I would say we're no longer human. It's like we're a bunch of poodles talking about when we stopped being wolves, you know, I'll tell you this, if I was a fucking locust and there was a grasshopper that's like, I'd be like, awesome, because I can fly. I'm flying,

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       I've evolved. This is our major disagreement. Years. You want to be a grasshopper. I'm cool with being a locus, but. But it's, it's an interesting thing, right? Well, what I think you're saying is there's more inherent biological happiness into remaining of grasshopper or remaining of human right? That's why the things that make that resonate most deeply with us are the things that reflect the culture alive. You hunting for example, you're not having trouble focusing your mind when you're hunting. You don't think there's your tapping and if you ever caught a nice fish, you've got fishing. I know that feeling when you catch a nice fish, there's a like a feeling. There's a primal reaction. I'm saying a nice fish because it's easier for people to accept because it's a cold blooded animal. Like something about like saying there's something about when you get a nice deer in your sites and you're ready to end its life.

Speaker 5:          01:41:46       People like, no, right when I'm about to eat a bear, but you say a fish. They go, oh, he caught a fish. They eat other fish, whatever. It's just for whatever reason, people don't care if you catch a fish, they don't give a fuck. We, we, we differentiate. We have more value in warm blooded animals than we put in in fish for whatever. Fucking you can't scream. I mean, I think if, what is Mitch Hedberg, it's got that great joke like thank God the fish can't scream because the ocean would be the scariest Jackie each other. That's true. That's right. But there is something about their expression. Listening is that many people, I think they don't take care of their young. That's a big one. Like this woman said that to me, one of the reasons why she eats fish, she doesn't eat chicken or any other animals.

Speaker 5:          01:42:35       I go, why? She goes, well, the fish don't take care of their young. I was like, damn, that's gangster. She drew the line in the sand and they eat each other. Well, they're cannibals like almost exclusively. I mean, I mean almost a universally like trout. One of the best ways to catch trout as a little baby trout floors that looked like a trail. Large mouth bass, large mouth bass lowers occasionally catch them with those, you know, they don't give a fuck. They're just here to eat whatever they can eat done. But it's innately inherently meaningful is what I'm saying. Right? And the reason it's inherently meaningful is because that's the animal that we evolved to be. And now we live in this society that's distracting us from that. Trying to sell it back and little pieces. Maybe you can afford a hunting weekend in Utah at this ranch. Uh, and what, what the hell was the point of losing the humanity? When do we stop being human? Yeah, I think we already have and I think that's the major fucking ailment of our time as far is a part of it and I certainly think there's a series of reward systems in our bodies that are not getting checked off like they used to like rewards, like fear, overcoming fear, difficulty, physical exertion, all these different things that people did and then the, the, the thing of seeing the fish, catching the fish oil.

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       There's this visceral genetic response to getting a fish like you got it. Now you're going to eat and that and your friends are going to. Yes, and when you pull a big fish like ah, there's this weird feeling where everybody, you get a little charge like we were. We were. We had a successful gathering. You got something, now we can eat and that's any built in. It's built into your system and it doesn't exist. When you go to the supermarket and you pick up that salmon steak that's already in Saran wrap and it's already got the little styrofoam bottom that you don't feel a damn thing. You don't feel anything but eat the same amount of nutrients. It's very strange what we've done. We've done, we've completely removed all the natural elements while needing those natural elements at the same time. So we removed any connection that we have to like we're eating this. Chris has brought this amazing ham. What does this stuff called? Again? I'm on Google. It's delicious. And explain it because it's a really cool way they, they make it

Speaker 6:          01:44:46       right. It's this, it's made from pigs that are the same race of pigs that the Romans brought to Spain originally 2000 years ago. There. It's called Pata Negra, which means black foot. And this is so in Spanish Ham. It's a, there are different gradations and this is the highest gradation. And uh, all they do is eat acorns. They live out in these big open fields. Beautiful. I've driven through there and the extra my daughter on my motorcycle and then they're cured. It's not cooked at all. It's not smoked. It's cured with salt. Lots of salt and then hung up and certain temperature. And how long is it good for? How long does it sit for? Forever. Forever. And you can buy these. I mean, I would love to bring you one, but I don't think they let them in the country, but you buy the whole leg. Whoa. Like a whole ham. It's cured. Yeah. And in most Spanish houses they'll have a ham and it'll be there. And so they've got this holder and you have a long knife and you slice it really thin. So it just doesn't go

Speaker 4:          01:45:41       bad at all. No, because it's cured. That's incredible that you could have a whole ham leg sitting out

Speaker 6:          01:45:45       all the way inside. Yeah, that's crazy. So you put a, you put a towel over it or something so that flies, don't get on it. And that's it, you know, and it can be there and it's a traditional thing around Christmas to, you know, give a gift of a ham and a in it'll last, you know, five, six months, whatever till they're done eating it. That's crazy. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:46:04       So my point being that this, this meat is in front of us. It's delicious. It was from an animal that wasn't even the live on this continent. Someone killed it in Spain. Did all this stuff to you. Brought it over here, we're eating it. We have zero connection to any of those activities. We don't want to have. We just eating it and it's delicious. We're loving it, but it's all on. Not as much as if we'd raise the pig and been involved in the process. You know, I cooked a ham. I smoked a ham. I haven't done one for about six months, but the last one I did was an animal that I shot and I smoked it in my brined it for six days and then I smoked. It was like this big project that I did and yeah, it was a way different sort of a feeling when you're eating and it's like, like I have a leg, I have a peg leg of a full ham on the bone. That's about that

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       big that's sitting in my freezer that I'm eventually going to Brian sometime soon and I'll stick that sucker in this w like water with garlic and salt and brown sugar and it sits in there for about six days and then I smoke it at like 250 degrees for hours and hours until. It's just as juicy, delicious, and a 140 degrees in the center. So you know all the parasites, potential parasites are dead. God. So good.

Speaker 1:          01:47:16       I got a big green egg and I got to say, man, there's nothing. There's some weird peace that comes over you. What's agreement? It's like it's a, it's a really cool grill man. And it's a fire grill so you've got to, you know. So there's no, it's not a gas grill so you have to adjust the. There's all these wonderful dials you have to adjust to get the heat. Right. But yeah man, like when you're sitting over an open fire cooking if feels good. I mean I know what you mean and I. and it's like you, it, it's like this thing like, Oh shit, I missed this feeling like this feels this feels as good as when I jump into a swimming pool or something. It's like elemental and so on.

Speaker 5:          01:47:55       Or like a nutrient your body needs that you're not getting and then you eat it and your body's gone. Please, thank you. Give me more. It's also this link. There's moments that people throughout history have had success hunting and then eating that meal over a campfire and when you do that, that is the most rewarding of all fires, like I've eaten meat that we shot like hours before from a deer on a campfire in the middle of Montana and it was one of the greatest nights of my life. It was amazing. Me and Bryan County, Steve Right now and my friend Ryan Callahan, a bunch of other friends were on this show and when we were sitting around this fire eating, I was like, I can't remember it. More enjoyable meal because there's fire and there's an animal that was just killed and we're cooking it and preparing it together.

Speaker 5:          01:48:38       There's all this camaraderie. There's the successful hunt aspect of it and then there's this, this primal satisfaction that you get from watching meat cook over fire and the warmth of the. I don't know how cold it was. Very cold. There's a sense of accomplishment, like we're comfortable because we're smart and other something. I love sleeping in a tent when it's raining and you're like, wow, like arm's length from me is miserable, cold drizzle and I'm warm. I got my candle and turn. I got my doobies. I'm like completely happy here. I love the sense of, okay,

Speaker 1:          01:49:10       accomplishment that that's another great feeling. The feeling of rain when you're safe

Speaker 5:          01:49:14       side, you're sleeping in a van even though you know, just to the sound. So I think, I think this is the key to human happiness that, that we're ignoring, that our society takes all these things that were free and daily reality for our ancestors. Takes them away and sells back cheap copies along with antidepressants and antianxiety meds. Right. I think that that summation of where we are, do you think that it's possible that we, like you said, are no longer human, were becoming a sort of, that this is a drawn

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       out process and we're just caught up in the wake of it domestic. We're in the process of being domesticated. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's why I think when you look at like the extreme progressive left movement that are just like so, so focused on like using the correct gender, pronouns do not offend, don't use this, what we're talking about with this Harvard placemat that they're handing back. This is like an uber domestic domestication thing. I mean it's almost like domestication. You look at the veteran, the American male, I mean talk about getting your balls snipped man in the last 15 years. It's become offensive to even be a man. It's become offensive to express a happiness with masculinity, right? Like to be able to be a straight. You can't be a term for it. I think that if you look at what the real problem as it seems to be, the people have mistaken language with intention.

Speaker 1:          01:50:50       So that's where the problem is. It's that words, you know, certain words. I mean, I've been, I've had it happen on twitter where you get, I think I did a podcast with a opry and he said the female perspective and so someone on twitter gets into an argument with me over how that you shouldn't say female perspective because that's, and I, I always saying, well look, you know, I know about the female perspective because I see from it a lot because inside of me I've got like a lot of. I was, I have a feminine side of me that, so I know what that is. It's the, you know, uh, Carl young was telling you about the anima and the animus that, that there's a masculine and a feminine inside of everybody that they're just in you, not me, bro. I know you're growing, you're free of it.

Speaker 1:          01:51:34       But, but, but just pay for yourself bro. But it's that. It's that, uh, when, when, when people get caught up in the symbol versus what the symbol is representing and, and completely ignore the fact like, think of how many different forms of fuck there are, like the term fuck or how many different forms of the word Shit there are. And all of them are intention based, you know, like that. You could say, if I say there's so many ways I could say fuck you to you. Like I'd be like, fuck you man. I could be like, Hey, fuck you man, and it's two different fuck use or you could do something awesome and I go, dude, fuck you. Yeah, exactly. That works too. Or exactly. Or like, man, I'm, I'm gonna. Fuck you joe. But the point is there's like every single one of these has behind it and an energy that has been encapsulated into the sound and that energy is all that matters to me and the fact that everyone has been caught up in the sound itself and forgotten the fact that the energy behind it is all that matters. That's where things are getting fucked up. Exactly what we were talking about earlier when we were talking about religion. Exactly on drugs, right? We're talking about why people are addicted to drugs. We're not talking about the emptiness

Speaker 3:          01:52:45       of their lives that leads them into those heroin and prescription drugs and all that. Also terrorism. We're talking about bombs going off and people getting killed. We're not talking about how, why someone's life is so empty that you put on a suicide vest in the first place. We're not. We're looking at the surface of things and we're not interested in what's going on behind. I was watching Fox News the other day and there was some woman who was on on and she was doing like one of those open letter to the president things and she was doing it all. Fox News, you know, and she was saying that this country was founded on Judeo Christian values and she was going to this thing about responding and Obama's response to the terror attacks in Paris. Not sufficiently burrowing. Exactly. Not, not, not sufficiently aggressive or didn't make her feel comfortable on top of it. Your job is to keep me safe, but it's just really an opportunity for her to step up and you know, and proclaim, claim her ideology to be the greatest ideology and this other ideology that's killing people. Right. Is representatives of this ideology that there's the enemy of this United States of America, which was founded by my call. That's

Speaker 1:          01:53:57       right. That's it, man. That's interesting. Yeah, because you. You realized that like that. What's that? There is a kind of war that's raging around this planet, but it's like a war against people who are, for whatever reason, intent on expressing anger into the world and 10 on expressing power over other people into the world and people who are thinking, I think there might be another way. Maybe there was a way that we can readapt or maybe there are evolved to fit into this society or maybe there's a whole new way where we don't have to try to constantly punch back at a person who has punched us. That's the war. It's just a war between when you get fucking hit on the interstate when your nice car gets hit because some asshole isn't paying attention. Do you get out and scream at him or do you ask him if he's okay and there's a whole group of people who think, no, you fuck that motherfucker up.

Speaker 1:          01:54:51       You teach them a lesson. Let them understand if he's not paying attention, he's gonna get fucked up. You become the hand of God and the world read, you know, bringing vengeance as much as you can. Or the other version of it is you try to overcome that desire and you become a servant of some concept, which is that the most important thing. Even if we've lost everything, man, even if we become locust and that's all gone and you know, the more you talk about it, man, the more I do know what you mean. Earlier I was like, ah, my low kids, but I do hear what you're saying. I think it's very sweet and actually kind of tragic and sad, but if this is the case, then we still have to figure out a way to like even now as much as possible put out into the world love and it doesn't matter what language we're using, if love is behind it, I think that's the highest thing. By the way, I think that's all that matters is like that meal was good because

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       you were with people you love. If you are sitting after that hunt with a bunch of people that you disliked or assholes, I bet it wouldn't have been as delicious as of a meal. Yeah, but here's the problem with that thought, it wouldn't have been as good. We had several meals behind the campfire where we didn't kill anything there wasn't as good,

Speaker 6:          01:56:00       but. And also you're in a love. You're a love supporting environment that you're working together, you're in nature, you're around a fire and you're successful at something that's difficult. All those things. Even if they were assholes, you'd probably find more common ground with them there. Then you would sit around a conference table. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:56:18       Well, it's definitely a, there's also a separation from society. Complete total separation. When you're up there, there's no cell phone signal. You don't hear anything. It's complete silence. It's a very strange feeling of almost a lonely detachment because you realize you are not, you're not just off the grid. The grid is nowhere to be seen and we need each other. Yeah. You need each other. Yeah. You got it. I think that's right

Speaker 6:          01:56:42       where we come from. We come from this place where we need each other. And where were the first thing you think, you know, like hunter gatherers, they, uh, they share arrows and so like, yeah, they typically share Arrow. So I make arrows a certain way. You make them another way, whatever, but then we all give them to each other. They're constantly flowing. So you might be on a hunt where you shot the elk, that Arrow that you shot is in the elk, but I made it and it's a way of obscuring who gets credit for the kill. And that's cool. And you find this universally among foragers, whether it's in the internet or in Papa New Guinea. They do these, they have these mechanisms to make sure that the sharing happens not only of the meat but of the reputational aspect. That's interesting. Everybody's cool. There are all these mechanisms built in to keep anybody from getting too big for their Britches, you know, till the cannibals move in and then they start killing

Speaker 3:          01:57:37       people and eating them because there's no protein because they couldn't get any elk. It's a problem that cannabis will move in

Speaker 6:          01:57:46       fuckers. You got to be ready. But here's the good news about the locus. They do switch bank, take grass offers. You can be aggressive. Stops. Yeah. Eventually. And then you can't fly anymore. You fuck. And Lucas are cannibalistic and grasshoppers aren't to tie it into the whole cannibalism. Yeah. That's why they swarm because if you slow down, the one behind you will eat you.

Speaker 3:          01:58:07       Oh my God. That's where we are working at Amazon. That's what it's like working in New York City working on Amazon. Supposed to be crazy. Right? There's warehouses they'll run around this time when you have a timer. Have you ever. There was a, I think it was a radiolab podcast, was one of the podcasts I listened to that talked to an ex employee at Amazon about what kind of stress it is to work. Like say if you order something, like say if you order a led flashlight and it, it shows up on their. They have like a little pad, like a, a tablet device and it has a timer and it's like you have to

Speaker 6:          01:58:42       go find this and you have to grab it and you have like 30 seconds so you like literally running, looking for this flashlight and you have to get it to the sorting and put it in the box and get the label. They had this terrible game show. There was a show like that when I was a kid when we had to run the money maze or something like that. I remember that you had to fill your car up with the most expensive things or something and know this is a different one. This is where you got like couples and you got the the like the wives up on a platform and the two husbands down and there's a maze like where the walls seven feet high and the women can see where the money is and they're yelling to their husbands like rats and like, no, go left.

Speaker 6:          01:59:24       I said left that and the husbands are scurrying around in the maze and whoever gets to the money pot first wins. It's a good divorce generating game show like so many of them. What do you think, man? Do you think it's hopeless? This you like when you talk about it and you talk about it and then I think about it, it's like, so it fills you this as a kind of like weirdness Dahlia. Like you think my God, this there's a type of life that is clearly still accessible to people but maybe not accessible to everyone as a whole. Do you have any idea of like how you would reorganize or restructure? What I say in the book is, is where there's no way we're going back. That's over, right? Because there's 7 billion. They're going to be 10 billion in 100 years. There's no way. There's not enough land or animals or whatever, so we're going to live in an artificial environment, but you know you're going to live in a zoo.

Speaker 6:          02:00:20       Do you want to live in the Calcutta zoo or the San Diego zoo? Right? I mean, come on. The San Diego Zoo. It's built with an understanding of the natural environment of the animals that are enclosed there. So I want to live in a natural environment that's got my interest in mind and in order to do that, you have to understand what kind of animal homo sapiens is, which means you have to cut through a lot of the bullshit propaganda that you've been here in your whole life. This hobbs and bullshit about how prehistoric people all died in their thirties. And it was a struggle for survival and predators lurked in every shadow. And it was this terrible, you know, dangerous world. You actually look at the anthropological data. Hunter gatherers are chilled out, happy, relaxed people who are not dealing with the sorts of chronic stress we are. And you hear all these bullshit arguments that wouldn't last a second if they weren't propping up the civilizational edifice like that. Everyone died in their thirties and hunter gathers. That's absolutely untrue. But I just heard the dean of the Medical School of Columbia University say it in an NPR interview. It's, it's everywhere. Not The worst thing to happen to die young. Well, there's certainly some benefits to modern medicine. One hundred percent, but there's, there's also some negative consequences of our overly complicated society. There's no doubt about it. I mean the, the levels of depression that people experienced

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       in the levels of discontent with their existence. You know, we were talking yesterday about people wanting to take a chance to go do something. They want to do something outside of what they're doing for a job. Like maybe they have, maybe they like making pottery or whatever it is, but they just don't have the time. Maybe they want to be a tattooist. They just don't have the time to dedicate to jump into it. And then along the way get saddled with debt and maybe a family that you have an obligation to feed. And then you're stuck in your trap. That trap that, that feeling of discontent with one's own daily existence. You Day by day life is more commonplace than not. It's way more common. It's essential because we were saying to keep you running on the wheel, you got to believe x is going to make you happy.

Speaker 5:          02:02:22       The cars going to, the next thing is going to do it. That's. And that's a pernicious lie that, that we've heard so many times we come to believe it's an, it's an aspect of reality itself. And it isn't. And that's, that's, you know, if you look at the hunter gather data, what you see is, is these people who, I mean you were talking about it earlier, how we need something to like a challenge to take us to the next level. For them, the challenge is like we're going to go hunting, you know, and it'll feel great and, and we'll eat and if we don't eat they will eat tomorrow. Well that's why those subsistence shows. Have you ever watched those shows and discovery channel shows? Those shows are extremely popular today because people are sort of recognizing that like, wow, these people seem happy and all they have is like five dogs.

Speaker 5:          02:03:08       They live in Alaska and they just take their sled out and they chopped down a fucking tree to build a house with like these people are living on the stamina. That's the thing is immediacy. Just to play devil's advocate here, isn't this a different version of what you're talking about? The modern human thinks, if I have this thing, a car or whatever the thing is, the nicer job, better or whatever, I'll be happy. What you're saying is if I have an immediacy, if I'm more connected to nature, if I moved to Alaska, if I become a hunter, I'll be happy, but both of these things have within them the idea that I need some other thing to be happy. Whereas the what I keep hearing and what I subscribed to you is that to be happy, you have to be in the present moment. Wherever you are, whatever situation you're in, whatever's going on, whether you're in an office and a job you don't like in a marriage you don't like with a bunch of kids that you don't like.

Speaker 5:          02:04:05       Instead of fleeing from that by planning some fantasy of becoming a tattoo artist or a potter, they're real way out is to allow yourself to be fully in the experience of what's happening right now and not that thing itself. Just doing that and maybe that is what happens when you're in nature as you are more in the present moment, but that makes way more sense when you're in nature because if you're working in an insurance company and you just go on over client's claims day in and day out, it's super hard to be in a joyful moment. It's super hard to be when you really want

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       to get out of there and make music like you have songs and ideas in your head. Do you want to put them to wax, but your fucking kids need formula? Well, it's not. It's not. Jus. The thing is it's like that. The idea is, sure, for sure, but this is where you're at right now. That's it, right? That's where you are. You're not at a situation where you're going to start a band and you're not in a situation where you're going to become a potter right now could be in the future, but the trick is that even though you're not in the fucking Anna rondex hunting and you're not fishing, even though you're wherever you're at right now, get into that place. Let Yourself, and it's not about happiness, it's certainly not about joy or bliss or anything like that. You're not feeling joy and bliss.

Speaker 1:          02:05:19       You're feeling a kind of claustrophobic horror at the concept that what the situation you're in right now is going to continue forever and so your mind is fabricated and escape route, which is this thing or that thing, whatever it may be, but the true, the true situation is that until you train yourself to be in the present moment, it doesn't matter where you are, you're dead. You're not alive, you're not. It doesn't matter. You have to train yourself to get in the moment. Then once you're in the moment, then start making the move. Okay. Now you say in the moment like how do you address that? Like what? When you're thinking about you being in the moment, like your own personal experience, what do, what do you do to try to achieve that sort of centered feeling? Well, it's, well, it's the practice of mindfulness.

Speaker 1:          02:06:08       So it's the idea of, you know, what it's, I will notice from time to time when I'm lucky that I've been carried away by my thoughts like that fucking thing you were saying about laying in bed. You can generate more stress chemicals. I'll recognize like, Holy Shit, I've been in a vortex of thinking for the last two days. I've been caught in this like endless recurring series of worries or scenarios or whatever it may be or things I need to do or things I uh, I just did. And, and suddenly I realized I haven't been here at all at all. I've just been caught up in what's called in your head. You're caught up in the thought pattern. So the, uh, the practice is, uh, and this is something like, you know, uh, uh, Jack Kornfield talks about how the Guy who taught in meditation, Adrienne Shaw, uh, uh, was saying to him that I'm, one of his students was saying, I'm too busy to meditate.

Speaker 1:          02:07:08       I'm too busy to Metadata, have time to do that. And his response was our youtube busy to breathe. Are you too busy to breathe? You can breathe, right? That's all you need to do. All you need is your breath. And no matter where you are, what you're doing, where you're at, you can begin to put your attention away from the incredible array of worries that you have incredible array of fantasies that you have incredible arrays of. If this had happened, I'd be happier if I could do this, I'll be a better person and just bring it to your breath in and out and through the nose, out through the nose. And then it's not going to stop these fucking thoughts, but instead of you being controlled by them and caught up in them, I mean, you talk about looking at your fucking cell phone. Get rid of cell phones.

Speaker 1:          02:07:52       People are still looking at cell phones. It's just their various worries and things that they're constantly ruminating over. It's another form of the cell phone. You're fixating on these endless recurring worries, so you bring it to the breath, the worries emerge, the happiness, whatever it is is there, but it's not you. You're not identifying with it anymore. You're not identifying with the specific emotional state, this specific intellectual state the specific thing anymore. You're just observing and watching and that thing, that consciousness, the more you become that, the more you will find yourself experiencing what you were talking about. These rare moments of peace, these moments of like, Whoa, Holy Shit, regardless of what's happening around me, I'm still centered, untouched, unfreaking, unanxious. I'm just watching. So that's the, that's the, uh, the concept. And it's a very hopeful concept because some people do not have access to the kind of zoo you're talking about prisoners, for example, people who are incarcerated right now, they don't get to get out of that system.

Speaker 1:          02:09:02       So they have to find a way in the midst of all of that negative phenomena to allow themselves to experience the same kind of peace or tranquility that you were experiencing with your friends in front of that Campfire, and that is why the concept of cultivation is so important in Buddhism, which is the idea that these experiences which in various many different world religions say it, their route, what is so wonderful about them is love that feeling of love, which is also compared to the feeling of coming home, being at home, finding your home, coming back home. It's all the same because the feeling of what is the feeling of being at home. It's a feeling of being at what did you call it, a situation of acceptance and love. It's that feeling of being sick, truly safe or not safe because of the government, but safe because you're surrounded by people who love you and you're loving them and you know that you can be taken care of.

Speaker 1:          02:09:54       The concept is that feeling can be cultivated in that cultivation starts with some form of the practice of mindfulness or whatever you want to call it. I think what you're saying actually isn't in conflict at all with the the other point, you know, the because the mindfulness being here in the moment. I think if you're like, if you've got a shitty job in a cubicle and you're trying to distract yourself from it, you're listening to podcasts all day while you shuffle paperwork or whatever, right? Um, and you're not really being in the moment. It is advantageous to be in the moment if it allows you to see

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       that the moment is fucking killing you and then you make a realistic. You're not going to be a hunter gatherer, but you make a realistic plan to change your life. It can be abused, right? I mean, if you're in prison, that's a different deal. You're going to be there for 10 years. You're not gonna like don't try to escape is my advice, but if, but if it's just a dead end job, I mean I got this great email a couple days ago from someone who I had these guys on who, uh, live in camper vans. Several, one guy, one guy, funny guy, he, uh, worked in a tiger sanctuary in Thailand teaching baby tigers not to eat people. Essentially. He was like the Guinea pig. It would go in and play with the baby tigers to teach them like, don't eat people. People are cool. Anyway, he flew to Chile, bought a VW Camper van and drove from Chile to Alaska in this camper van and just picked up people along the way and you know, had all these adventures for years.

Speaker 5:          02:11:29       I think he said, wow. Anyway, years of driving. Yeah. Yeah. I mean off and on, you know, it would break down. I think he, he swapped out the engine five times or something cause vw vans and known for reliability. Anyway, so somebody who listened to this series of podcast I did with people who live in their vans, some guy's like, yeah, I quit my job. My wife and I bought a van. We'd been in it six months and it's fucking awesome. You know, it's like he completely changed his life. He's and he's thrilled. I love to hear, if you live in a shitty situation like that long enough for the job you hate and bills that don't make any sense and for stuff that you don't even want or enjoy anymore than that idea of getting in that camper and just driving across the country seems amazing.

Speaker 5:          02:12:10       It seems like freedom and it's doable. It's doable if you're. If you're willing to give up a lot of the bullshit, you know? That's right. Yeah. That's the thing, man. My friend Steve Maxwell, he doesn't even have a camper. He just lives in hotels. He has a bag for all of his belongings. He's a pro. He's a personal trainer and he's like world renowned. He puts on these camps and seminars and stuff like that and him and his girlfriend, they travel all over the world. Constant travel, that's all they do. They stay from hotel to hotel and he trains people everywhere and he used to have a big gym and he used to have a house and then he went from the big German house, get divorced. He got like a camper van, like with a like a, like you're sleeping. It got sick of that, sold that fucking things that, you know what?

Speaker 5:          02:12:51       I'm just going to get everything down to a 10 gallon bag. He's got a 10 gallon bag with all his worldly possessions and that's it. Yeah. Digital nomads, you know about them. There's a growing, thriving world of young people who have jobs where they do stuff on the Internet, right? They either coding or editing or whatever. Something you can do through the computer. So if you're making money through the computer, why he living in la where you're paying two grand, three grand for, you know. So they moved to places like Bangkok, Ecuador, there, there's like hotspots around the world where there are thousands of these people living out of backpacks, they live in guest houses and they work in cafes or wherever they get Wifi and that's what they're doing. And it's a

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       funny thing because they're ahead of the laws, right? So tax laws don't know what to do with these people because you don't, you're not stable anywhere. And the laws are all set up where you pay tax, where you are. Well I'm three months in Bangkok, then I'm off to Chile. Then I'm off here like, well who do I pay tax too?

Speaker 4:          02:13:49       I'll take it to the next level. What if you switched everything to digital currency and finding more and more people are accepting bitcoin and other forms of digital currency. So they start using that to pay for the rent, pay for their food, pay for their drinks, pay for their travel, no record of animal, what the fuck. And then they live in Thailand sometimes. Yeah, sometimes they don't. Wild Man. And so it should be the idea of you being constrained to a patch of dirt and you have to have a piece of paper to show other people and the other patch of dirt so I can cross over. Can I enter into your kingdom? Depends. Did you at one point in time drive your carriage under the influence of wine, but I was in the call was denied entry into my kingdom of doubt of you're in a car with someone and they're drunk and you're sober and you get pulled over.

Speaker 4:          02:14:40       You're going to get a Dui. If you get that. Yes. If that person's drunk and you're an adult and you're sober and that person's drunk driving, you can get a dui to try. You can get in trouble for allowing someone to drive a car. I don't know what exact for polk. Find out what exactly the law is. How the fuck would you mainly similar. It's extremely similar, if you will. I believe in. It might be a state to state basis or am I just made it up, but I'm pretty sure it's true. If you are drunk,

Speaker 2:          02:15:06       I made it up. I really, if you, if you are drunk and you have a passenger in your car, that passenger I think in can get arrested as well. Wow. Even if they don't have a driver's license, if they're an adult, I think they can get arrested as well if they don't have a driver's license at all. That's a good point. That's interesting because then it's like, well officer, you know it took the wheel but you're driving without a license. Like, well yeah, but my point being they won't let you. In Canada, if you have a Dui they'll go fuck off. Get out of here. They turn you around. They want no douchebags in Canada. If you have a violent assault and you're on your arrest record. I almost got kicked out it. I almost got not let into Canada had a will for having stolen a snickers bar in Alaska in 1982.

Speaker 2:          02:15:48       Oh my God. Yeah. I went to prison. I think I told that story. Yeah, you did this area. So. But I was told when I did four days, you know, and then I went before the magistrate and he said if you don't get arrested again in a year, this will go off your record and all that. So ever since when I've been asked if I've ever been convicted of a crime, I always said no because I figured it's not on my record. I don't want to confuse everybody and you know, whatever. And, but the first time we went into Canada at BC, you know, he asked all these questions and we went and sat down and he called me up, you know, just, you know, my wife and you. And he's like, is there anything you want to tell me about 1980 to 1982, I don't know. I was college and

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       I don't know what he said, the arrest and conviction, fairbanks, Alaska. I'm like, how are you kidding me? And I told him I eat a snickers bar and the fucking grocery store and it turned into this thing and. But they told me it wasn't on my record and he said, well, Canada gets your FBI records.

Speaker 4:          02:16:48       So. So if you're ever so like there's a federal level where that shit doesn't go away, you know, it's even more deep because Eddie Bravo got arrested and never even went to jail and it shows up every time he goes into Canada. He got arrested because he worked for a check cashing company and so he used to drive around with large sums of cash on him. When he got pulled over by the cops, cops pulled them over and he said, officer, I want to let you know that I have a loaded handgun in the car. Here's my license to have it. They go, please step out of the car. They handcuff him, they check everything, make sure it's all kosher, everything checks out. They let them go. But that incident is on his record. So when he goes into Canada, they pull them aside. Every time I got stuff with him once, now I fucking, if we go to Canada together, I left that to get ahead of me. Like, y'all fucking meet you outside because he gets dragged into that room. Then they start asking you questions too. And I'm like, dude,

Speaker 1:          02:17:38       at least they're Canadian. Yeah. Hearing hearing were coming the other way. It is

Speaker 4:          02:17:43       you. If you can't offer a convincing defense as to why you weren't driving, you may also be arrested and charged with reckless endangerment. You're arresting. Officer will argue that you put yourself, the driver and members of the public in danger by allowing your friend to drive drunk. Their case may be bolstered by the presence of other passengers in the vehicle. Wow. Yup. You'll need to prove that. The paragraph before that said, you need to prove that you're not currently licensed to drive. Don't know how to drive or have a medical restriction that prevents you from driving crazy. Yeah. See. So I'm kinda right.

Speaker 1:          02:18:21       Better off being shit faced. So if your shit faced and your friend's driving, then you're okay. Yeah. You're shaking. Your friend's driving like, I wouldn't fucking drive home drunk. I'm so drunk. I didn't even know he was drunk. So if you get pulled over and you're not drunk, hit that bottle for the splash whiskey all of your face. You're hammered here. Okay. He should play as play. Sleeping or just say I took acid more than five times. I hadn't legally insane. I couldn't drive to the real scary thing about what you're talking about as far as like getting in other countries because it shit on your record. This is something that when I interviewed Aaron Frank at Singularity University, they, they, they try to like think about like what are the implications of these technologies? So you know, the um, the recent terrorist attack or they shot up that people that couples shout out the people and apparently even though I think this got disproven, Bernardino San Bernardino, there were talking about how one of them was a professed jihadist on their facebook page and they're saying, well we don't check social there.

Speaker 1:          02:19:23       So whatever they've posted on facebook, we don't do that. And you know, a lot of news stations are saying, a lot of people are saying, what the fuck? That's crazy. You should check that. You should definitely check that. So at singularity university there saying what happens if the society changes so much, that shit that you've posted online and admitted to doing becomes illegal. What happens then when all of that stuff is infinitely accessible by all future governments? What happens when if like who knows? You know, this is the scary thing that may happen right? With mccarthy and the the ride communist shaken shift. Just that and that's the terrifying thing and I don't want to put negative energy out there. I think we're all beings of love and ultimately everything's going to be okay, but the but the one scary thing about when you look at like for profit or for profit conflict and you and you look at the fact that there is a benefit to some awful thing happening in the United States on a big scale.

Speaker 1:          02:20:29       There's a monetary benefit to a great many people living in the United States, weapons manufacturers, legislators, people who are just get off on controlling other people and you realize that it not only benefits them, but they're also as a huge incentive for people in other parts of the world to create that event. Knowing that all it takes is one catastrophic event. One catastrophic event were away. We were like, what? One dirty bomb away. One new September, 11th away from experiencing one of the greatest dimunition of personal liberty that has ever happened in this country and the people who. There's a lot of people who would like that to happen and they're not just terrorists. There's people who would like that to happen, who run prisons. There are people like that to happen who like says who want world war three to happen because they sell web. There's so in.

Speaker 1:          02:21:26       That to me is fucking scary to think. And if something like that did happen and when we enter into some new or wellbeing awfulness, it didn't. In all your shit that you've posted every single one of your podcasts. So you're going first man, what a moving to Canada. It doesn't matter. You can't get into Canada. You can't get into fucking candidate with the stuff you posted on your facebook page and you will know. I mean we're talking about what said, I think you got to get out now. That's what I'm going to be. Australia saved nowhere, so it seems like a good move. Australia is awesome over. Melbourne's amazing. Although they're Sudanese perinos know Melbourne's got, they've got some seriously strict drug laws. Man. I was at the, I was, I was, I was in Australia at the uh, uh, yeah, no, actually that was, I was in New Zealand, not Australia. Sorry. I think Australia is strict drug laws in New South Wales does help bring sniffer dogs around, you know, like we're out in public. Just try to find. We're

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       locked. Then you can't even wash the weed out of your hair. How do you going to smell it to bang a cat? Cat up a tree. Well, again, I think we're there. I mean, you keep phrasing things in terms of like what if we're on the verge of. And I keep thinking, dude, we've been there for a long time. I mean, Eisenhower's, you know, his parting speech, the military industrial complex is, you know, he was warning at. We're in a situation after World War Two where the army doesn't stand down all these industries. That sprang up Los Angeles as a result of World War Two, right? A Raytheon and Boeing, they're all on the west coast because they were pumping out those airplanes and ships to go beat the japs and then they, they're looking for something to do while they got to keep us on a war footing forever consulted my Harvard placemat and you shouldn't say zap jabs. Oh, I thought I said Nips. My cries even worse. Your cultural appropriation culturally appropriating their work. She, the, that always gets me that we'd make up names for countries we don't like the name they use. What do you guys call yourself? Nip Paul. We don't like it. We're going to Japan. Japan please. We just decide like, this is a bunch of them. Like that. That was quite a few countries is in Greece. Grease the. They didn't call themselves grease right where they call himself. That's great to me.

Speaker 7:          02:23:58       Uh, use

Speaker 2:          02:23:58       a Turkey to Turkey. They call themselves Turkey. It was a few countries and I don't remember what does the word they use mean Turkey? I don't know. You know, I don't think. Yeah, it's weird that it's the same as that bird. If it wasn't for Thanksgiving, would anybody give a fuck about Turkey country whole hunt or. No? Nobody likes to eat Turkey. I mean, it's good, but it's not. The best grain is better than Turkey. Can we agree? Yeah. There's no Kentucky Fried Turkey. Yeah. There's no Turkey stores now. Chicken stores is Popeye's chicken. There's. There's A. There's Kentucky Fried Chicken, Turkey King Edward Bernays. Turkey Bacon for breakfast is is completely an invention of this advertising guy. He was hired by the company. I forget the name of the company, but they're still around in some form that hired him to sell more pork and so he came up with this idea like bacon and eggs.

Speaker 2:          02:24:59       That's what's for breakfast. You got to like integrate it into the cultural traditions and ever since then it's been considered breakfast meat and boom. Meanwhile it's awesome. So congratulations. So he was also behind the fluoridation of the water supply hired by Alcoa because they had all this, all this. I'm a byproduct of making aluminum, which is fluoride. And they wanted to like, what are we going to do with all this stuff? You know, we've got to find a way to sell it. Who can we sell it to? And he figured out like, Oh, we can, you know, it's good for dental. It'll save everyone and get the government to buy it. It's so funny. We accept that man because like if someone comes over to your house and you're like, do you want some water? And they're like, yeah. And you're like, do you want me to add some fluoride to it?

Speaker 2:          02:25:42       I'd be like, fuck yeah, it is a chemical that kills you. So yeah. Could you put a little fluoride in your head can kill you. It doesn't take a whole lot. Like how much kills you? A couple of teaspoons. Full. I don't know. I have no tie with white teeth. But is that real? What's going on with dental hygiene versus. I mean, is it Florida in the water that makes a difference or being conscious of dental hygiene, dental hygiene. It's made the difference in tooth decay and people. Well, I mean talking to you, talking to me, I'm always going to take it back to foragers. Foragers have amazing teeth meet and roots and shit. Well, some sand in a Weston Smith. What is this? We put in this. Oh, this is bernays. Said that. Get the Bacon for breakfast and he is also responsible for fluoride in the water and Dixie Dixie Cup.

Speaker 2:          02:26:34       Jamie is just like Dixie Cup show and then I'm not full of Shit. I love it. Jamie. Thinking that they were drinking out of unsafe. What? What? Look at this. His campaign for Dixie Cups. Scared people into thinking that glasses they were drinking out of. We're unsanitary and can be replaced by disposable cups. Wow. Did you read this for you? Put it up. That's insane. And it was the beach nut packing company that's hired. This guy was amazing, but the bacon he got right. Oh, he got. He got everything right. Dead on with the Bacon. Bacon. He also was behind the Virginia slims thing like, oh, how can we use feminism to get women to buy cigarettes? It's a feminist cigarette and it's come a long way, baby. I bet that guy got laid like crazy. I bet he was just a fucking maestro and he was Freud's nephew.

Speaker 2:          02:27:22       Oh my goodness. So he had the benefit of psychological examination under his uncle and he's proud of himself, like he doesn't slightly ashamed dead. He just died like 10 years ago. Interviews with them where he's like, yeah, I did all this. Shit was happy. His success ratio is amazing, right? Oh, he hit every one out of the park over and over. If that's what you're trying to do and nobody tells you it's evil mean no one really. You know what's really fucked up is those God damn drug commercials, those drug commercials where people are happy and they're walking hand in hand and meadows and then they start talking about explosive bloody diarrhea, but they always do it in that voice that I think we're being trained to ignore. There's that voice at the end of the thing. Side effects may include whenever they me to just ignore what I'm saying and watch the pretty picture. Watch a pretty picture as your dog. Exactly about this bullshit. They should have to show you those side effects while they're doing this. Is this is hilarious, I don't know if you've seen this. I tweeted this the other day. The Australia came up with this thing called a stoner slaw and it's so stupid

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       that people. It's backfiring and causing people to smoke pot. Also stoner slot. If you go to stoner slot.com, it's an actual weed website, so what's funny about it is that it actually brought all this business too because if you go to stoners, sloths.com dot a U. I don't know the exact. Yeah, there it is. Yeah. If you go to stoners, sloths, whatever their website is dot a you. Yeah. There you go. In the only sell Endeca and that's right. Yeah, there it is. Your worse on wheat, so that's a. You now take the. Hey you off. I haven't tried it. I might embarrass myself here, but an article I read, they said it goes to a weed website. I guess not. Maybe somebody bought it. Who know the government social network. They have a stoner, sloths social network. What do they think it's going to turn into?

Speaker 3:          02:29:19       The next thing is going to turn to the next facebook, but yeah, this is like a big embarrassment. Let's play it because it's fucking so stupid. It's so stupid. It's awesome. I haven't seen it. It's so dumb, but it's like that fucking thing. Here's the thing about, um, the talking dog commercial that we all enjoyed back in the day. Yeah. Those were made by our partnership for drug free America and the fucked up part about a partnership for drug free America is they are funded by alcohol and tobacco companies and pharmaceutical companies. And my joke was that's like hookers doing commercials against strippers and it really is like them doing commercials pot. It's insane. Like they're not against drugs, just drugs that they don't sell here.

Speaker 3:          02:30:07       Slaw in class. You're worse on weed. Stoner. Sloth, but little did the creators know. Oh, I see that stoner. Sloths.com. Somebody put it down. Is also the name of an online cannabis product. Retail. It's not on. It's not up anymore though. That's what's weird. I wonder if their website got crushed. Yeah. Maybe stoner. Sloth. Yeah. Well this is. This is something that Australia is doing because they're kind of behind the times when it comes to marijuana propaganda, they. They're still buying into some shit that we thought of 15, 20 years ago. New South Wales government ads. This is just so stupid. Yeah, so Australia will be perfect if it had weed, but that's the thing about the world. There is no perfect place. You go to the most amazing jungle island habitat and you know, well you got to hang out with these fucking people. Right? You know Australia though. Other than that, other than their stance, I lead a Melbourne's. Most of my favorite places I've ever been. Remind me. A lot of San Francisco Sorta cafe

Speaker 5:          02:31:19       vibe and progressive and very smart, very smart people. You guys should do the. I went down there to do this thing called the festival of dangerous ideas. You guys, you guys would both fit right into the vibe. It's really cool. You get. It's like Ted, I think we might've talked about it. It's like Ted, but without the sort of brand protection, paranoia and that's a great way to put it down and then protection. They're just like, you know, just say something crazy and provocative and we just want people to walk out of here talking about whatever you say and that's great. Bringing shame shape because we're not getting on a fucking plane and fly across the ocean to sound provocative and your country where they do what they do at the Sydney Opera House. That's pretty cool. Yeah, I played there. That's, that's an awesome spot. Sydney is awesome too.

Speaker 5:          02:32:08       I like Sydney as well. I like both. I like Sydney, like Melbourne was interesting because uh, the food was fucking sensational. Yeah. Of that Asian market. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Have you, did you go up to the barrier reef and do all the announcements? I didn't either. It's only up there for a few days for the fight, for a, had a couple shows. Oh, you were there just recently for the lousy thing. It's amazing how wrecked your brain gets when you come back. Like wrecked for days I would work out and I'd just be like, where I'd normally be able to do like 10 reps of something. I'd get to like six and I'd be like, fuck, I got three more, seven, fuck two more. I just couldn't do it. I almost couldn't do the same physical things that I used to do. I mean I could get to it, but like if I was going to do 10 reps, I'd probably get like nine or eight, but the, but getting to it would be way harder.

Speaker 5:          02:33:02       But just like I couldn't believe it man. And everyone's like, you're going to be fucked up for about a week from that. And it's true. It really does. Requeue does something weird to you, like you just, you feel like your battery is broken. Well this Guy Dan who does all the sleep research, uh, this is his area, like he's looking into why, why that fucks you up so bad. Can you change Melatonin and you know, using different medications and different techniques. He works with seals and stuff. He's like hardcore guy and apparently there are all these techniques that you can do a changing your sleep cycle before you go and you know, time. So you wake up at a different time and all that. It just seems like too much trouble to me. You know what they say too? This is very bizarre. It's way harder to go from Australia to the United States and it is to go from the United States to Australia like apparently that doesn't fuck up your circadian rhythms as much. You're going east is harder. We're just so weird because we want to think of ourselves as being very simple, very simple, very autonomous little beings that I just need my food, my vitamins, and I'm normal. Now. You're like tied into the cycles of the earth itself. The light and dark, the literal rising and setting of the sun has a direct effect on the rhythm of your body, your biological operating

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       system, falters. When you throw that and it has to readjust and set things back and think about women who are menstruating with the phases of the moon every month. I mean that's really intense. Here's my favorite one is when a bunch of chicks live together and they start smelling pussies and their, their, their bodies don't even realize it, but they get these coinciding menstrual cycles. How strangers. Then if that's happening, what other stuff is happening that we don't know about, like how much are humans harmonizing with each other and other ways that we aren't even aware of it, but my favorite example of that is this guy bruce vet weekend in Switzerland who did research that become known as the sweaty shirts study. I don't know if I've talked about this on the podcast before, but so he. He wanted to understand why women's sense of smell is so much stronger than men's.

Speaker 2:          02:35:06       Women can smell about seven times more than men. Really? Yeah. Which is time. If you come home with smelling funny, you're not going to get away with it. That sucks for them, man. You need to come home smelling funny. Like smelling like pussy. Exactly. Yeah. I don't think you're going to get away with it. So anyway, so he wanted to understand why is this and his hypothesis was that women are picking up information about men's immune system from their pheromones, from the way they smell, because you'll hear women often will say like, he's a cool guy. He's got a good job, he's funny, whatever, but the smell smells not right. It's a deal breaker. The smell, they'll say the smell smell, and it's not that he smells bad, it's just the smells not right. That'll be a deal breaker for a lot of women. You never hear him say that, right?

Speaker 2:          02:35:49       Yeah, but you do. People do smell better. Like some people just smell good, smell them. They just want to squeeze them. They smell good. You know, and I'm not talking about like perfumes or just body. I kind of a little bit offensive. I've always felt like perfumes, a little offensive. Like I want to know what's going on here. Why? Because it's a masking. Your fucking smoke bomb thrown down. I can't. Trying to find out where. Where's the real you? And they're like, well no one's ever smelled a woman like a healthy woman and go, man, I wish he'd fucking spray some roses on this big. You know, France in the old days. Well that's a different thing, right? You're dealing with personal hygiene issues, but today when you're dealing with people that take regular showers, bathe so you don't stink, sorry, just to finish the story. So check this out because this is important knowledge for people to have.

Speaker 2:          02:36:40       So he, he, uh, got a bunch of guys who were deficient in one part of their immune response and then a bunch of women who were also deficient in one part, the immune response, it's called his immune histocompatibility index and let's say it has five elements. So they would find a bunch of guys who are low in one or two or number three or number four, whatever. And women who had the same different deficiencies. That hypothesis was that a woman who's low in factor three won't be attracted to men who are low in factor three, there'll be attracted to men who are high in factor three because then the babies be healthy,

Speaker 6:          02:37:16       right? So he gets these guys to wear tee shirts for three days and nights with no deodorant, no showers, no soap, nothing. Then puts the tee shirts in plastic bags. Then he has the women's smell, the bags and mark on a piece of paper how attractive they thought the men were based only on the smell of the tee shirts. Right. And he found that with 80 percent of the women they chose as he predicted that they chose the men high and the thing that they were low in and they avoided the men who were low in the thing that they were alone, but in about 20 percent they seem to be choosing randomly. So he went back and looked at the women again and found that those 20 percent were on birth control pills, birth control pill, short circuits that response. Well, so think of how many couples who have gotten together when she's on the pill and they both, like Louis Ck, Joe's looking into just looking into the distance.

Speaker 6:          02:38:09       Was she on the pill? And I met her. Uh, I talked about this at an interview in San Francisco on the pbs station down there. And as I'm talking, the guys going, making the gesture like that happened to me, but be quiet, don't say. And after the interview, he's like, dude, that's exactly. My wife went off the pill and she was done with me. She didn't want them sleeping in the same bed. She didn't want me in the same house. Suki, a lot of marriages are falling apart because they got together when the woman couldn't smell, he is compatibility and it's not his fault. Shit. Yeah, isn't that? That's a mind blower. And it's one of these things, like Dumbo was saying, where we ignore these natural reflex is to our detriment. We pretend we're not animals. Fuck that. Of course

Speaker 5:          02:38:54       we're animals. We're just the coinciding menstrual cycles alone. Obviously there's some crazy shit going on, but that is like another level crazy shit that I didn't even think about. All the factors that would lead to you being out of whack if your body's constantly thinking gets pregnant. And that's what. That's what the pill does. It tricks your body into thinking, don't get pregnant, you already pregnant.

Speaker 6:          02:39:15       And that's why a lot of women have much less libido when they're on the pill.

Speaker 5:          02:39:19       Oh yeah. Already pregnant. So I'm just really bad. And I dated a girl and she off the pill, she was so fucking Horny, but then she got on the pill and it was like it just stopped. And then she got off the pill again. She was like, we gotta figure out something else because I don't even like sex when I'm on the pill. She was like, I'm totally disinterested, but off the pill she was crazy horny. It was. It was like a switch went off. It took like two days. She started taking the pills and then it just wouldn't just shut down. She would be dry. It was like his crate and then off the pills. She's a freak nuts. That concept that there's this data field, like a chemical data field surrounding everybody makes sense that you can tune into and understand aspects of like deep aspects to know a person's like some specific deficiency in their immune system just from your nose.

Speaker 5:          02:40:09       That's crazy. And that kind of stuff lends credence to idea of telepathy or clairvoyance or people who can read other people really well. Like maybe they're just somehow better at detecting whatever chemical field is around the person. And can decode it in a certain way. What are we doing with like people were have a whole culture of women that are taking pills that trick their body and did not being able to recognize the clues of compatibility. You think about how many kids are born with health deficiencies because of this, because people low in, you know, number three and get together and these kids have. Wow. Yeah. There's all sorts of, you know, we were talking earlier about smearing vaginal fluid on a newborn baby who's born through csection. Again, we're pretending we're not animals. We're pretending there's not a huge benefit in, in being contaminated with life, you know, that were these sterile creatures that exists separate from our shit and Piss in her.

Speaker 5:          02:41:08       It's one of the things you realize from grappling in Jujitsu when you start getting really into it. Do you have to keep a healthy biome? You have to keep healthy skin floor. It's critical. Like one of the first things they tell you when you start training is you should start taking supplements like acidophilus something, probiotic, because you want to keep your skin flora healthy and you want to not use antibiotic soap like a lot of times when people get infections, one of the problems is they've created a barren wasteland on the surface of their skin, so infections to take hold and then you treat those infections with more antibiotics and you kill off all the natural healthy like acidophilus in particular is supposed to be aggressive towards certain types of infections so that like if you keep a healthy skin flora, you're less likely to get things like ringworm or things along those lines.

Speaker 5:          02:41:58       Well, this is also what they're talking about. Either this, there's a new kind of antibiotic resistant. What does that. Can you explain that? Because I keep reading about it sounds terrifying. Well, it's, you know, the, the pathogens are constantly mutating, right? In response to whatever antibiotics has been developed and we've come to the end of this particular line of antibiotics. So there's no more. There's no more variations on this molecule right? They keep tweaking it, tweaking it, and they've tweaked it every way, every which way possible. And this pathogen has mutated once again as we knew it would. And there's nothing, there's nothing. There's no response. So if you get this infection, your dad back to the 14, I put this way back, it puts us back to wherever to the play or whatever your arm amputated. And we had um, you know, Rhonda Patrick, have you ever listened to her? Dr Rhonda Patrick. She had a pretty significant Murcia infection of staph infection that just wouldn't go away. And you know, she fixed it with topical use of ground garlic and grape seed extract. The ground garlic apparently has this radical effect on, uh, on mercer. And another thing that supposedly helps to his cannabis oil. Cannabis oil is supposed to be really good

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       at fighting off staffed staph infections. So what else is good? I mean, I don't know about staff, but seawater, seawater, seawater is good as my wife. Irrigated wounds with seawater a lot in Mozambique and pissing on your feet keeps the athlete's foot away. Isn't that weird? Yeah. We were taught that in wrestling, if you've got athlete's foot, you're pressing, your feet are just pissed on your feet every, every morning, especially that first pice is really because it's full of uric acid accumulated overnight, just piss on your feet every morning in the shower and you just don't get athletes, so that's why people drink their pis. They would drink their first pice of the morning because it supposedly has all our vitamins and nutrients and it's very bizarre practice. I don't know about that.

Speaker 2:          02:43:57       I've done it. I've drank my piss a few times to experiment. I don't know. I'm probably not. I'd probably better off with like a multivitamin. It seems to me if you were meant to drink your pis then you wouldn't piss. Yeah. Well your body would just send it right back in. Right. But this. Why were you why your balls and the outside to keep them? People can kick them. No, it's to keep them cool. Okay. You know what I'm saying? Like there's some flaws. That's the wrong metaphor for me, man. I don't think Pistons a flaw. It is. If you know, otherwise you would go, you would dehydrate. I mean if like, if you never dehydrated, your body would never express water in that way. Like you take water and you keep a healthy level and it's like oil in your car, like you know, your levels there, you're good.

Speaker 2:          02:44:41       But no, we're like constantly getting rid of it, but I guess it actually cycles through your body and it takes impurities out and actually there's a lot of other things going on when you drink a lot of water. That's why one of the things that happens to people in, they're dehydrated, they get kidney stones and get crystallized things in your body and you know, you have to piss those out of your Dick Hole. I had, I had a kidney stone. We dehydrated. I don't think so. This beer count. Um, what else? Diarrhetic. Yeah, I know. I don't know the hall's diarrhetic right? Yeah. Yeah. But they say it dehydrates you. Alcohol ultimately, you know. But here's an interesting fact. Did you know that all animals pissed the same amount of time. All of them. It's this bizarre fractal thing. Yeah. Jimmy can confirm whether as Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jimmy, call them young Jamie young, Jamie A. Yeah, apparently it's like the size of the bladder and the volume of the urethra is.

Speaker 2:          02:45:38       It's like a fractal thing where it could be a mouse or an elephant, so a full piss takes the same amount of time for an elephant as it does for a mouse and elephant piss. It's like Jesus. So waterfalls and drinking that. It's insane. Most mammals take 20 seconds. Same with humans. Not if you're drinking beer. Well your bladder, right? So it doesn't matter what's in it yet, but if you fully hold your pis in for like a long time and you finally get to a bathroom, you're like, uh, I've definitely piss along on the 22nd. That's really nice of them. Do include an image of a Beagle in case you wondered what the least offensive penis that they could find. One that doesn't represent the patriarchy illegal. Couldn't get like a pit bull. They got racehorse in there. Did you see that? It Will Piss pee for about as long as a rhino.

Speaker 2:          02:46:35       A racehorse because people say high pitched like a rain or I got to Piss like a race horse, but I think there's talking volume. You ever seen a race horse piss. Good Lord. Yeah. The volume is just stunning. Comes fast. Sti Pressure. Yeah. It's like Wah. So I'll tell you what. This kidney stone made me think there is a god and he loves me or she because it was a horrible thing. You guys haven't had a kidney stone. It's just like. So I wake up, I think I told this story on a live podcast I did with you in San Francisco. I don't remember. Long time ago. Yeah. I remember thinking why am I telling the story? But uh, so I, I woke up excruciating abdominal pain. Cosillo my wife who's a doctor, thought I had a gas bubble in my intestines. So she had me upside down on the sofa with a funnel stuck in my ass.

Speaker 2:          02:47:25       And she was born in Hollow Party at Chris Ryan. She's foreign extra virgin olive oil. Oh my ass. I remember laying there upside down. That's what I remember thinking like honeymoon was over. We're into marriage now, this is marriage, but uh, cuz she's like, she's a doctor, she's completely like the bodies of the body. She doesn't give a shit clinical. Um, but anyway, it turns out it was a kidney stone, long story. It had already gone into the two between my kidney and my bladder. And so that's what the pain is, that it's sort of scrape and it's way down the tube, but it didn't block the flow so it wasn't having the kidney infection, which people sometimes get that's really dangerous. What they do then they operate on you. Well, what they wanted to do is they send sound waves in from your back, from the back and the front, and they calibrate it so that the waves meet right where the stone is.

Speaker 2:          02:48:15       And you say the back in the front, you mean your decoding your bottom in your abdomen. It's going from your kidney in this little tube down to your bladder. Well, how do they get that sound in there? So they, they do, uh, an x ray and find exactly where it is. Right? And then they have like sonogram machines, right? That are sending vibrations and and they meet at the point where the stone is in the break it into sand and then you can piss it out. So yeah, it's great. But unfortunately mine had already passed through the tube into my bladder by the time they got around to it. So they're like, well if it's in the bladder, we can't do it. We're going to have to go in through your dick with needle nose pliers. They go up and grab this thing and then pull it out, take your awake. What is happening? And I asked and I had the meeting with the anesthesiologist and I'm like, can you just put me under for this? I do not want

Speaker 6:          02:49:08       to be awake when someone

Speaker 2:          02:49:09       can your eyes. She says, see the screen behind you'll redman up boy.

Speaker 6:          02:49:17       So I was like, not into this. Right? And I'm on the waiting list and it's like any day they're going to call me and I'm going to go in and they're going to like put this thing out my dick. And meanwhile it was new year's Eve [inaudible] and I wake up in the morning, New Year's Day morning, we have sex, I go downstairs to the bathroom and I'm pissing in the bathroom sink because we have this Asian toilet squat, toilet. So if you paste it, if I piss in that standing up, it splashes all over. So the deal is I piss in the sink and rinse it and it's fine. You never noticed. Never noticed. So I'm pissing down the side of the sink and put outcomes. The stone paintings, how many was it? It's like half. I don't know. Is that a centimeter? Something like, you know that about the size of your fingertip?

Speaker 6:          02:50:06       It's a real rock. It was like a, it was like a snowflake. It was a wafer. A thick thicker than a snowflake. But like a wafer, it just pumped out and somehow it had gotten into the tube and the orgasm. The ejaculation pushed it right up to the end of my Dick. And then when I pissed it just popped out. It was no pain at all. It was masked by the orgasm. So it looped it up. It looped it up and it and it, you know, filled my head with endorphins or whatever when I was having the orgasm. So I didn't feel the pain. I felt like a slight burn. But like, yeah, whatever day it was. Fantastic. So that's my kidney stones story. So I do, I think I've looked over a cassie took it to the hospital and had it analyzed or would they say uh, well they, I guess they can by looking at the chemical composition, they can tell what causes it. If it's a chronic thing or if it's dehydration or whatever. What if it was from another planet, Bro? You're pissing out million. Rob. Getting a tiny little writing on it.

Speaker 2:          02:51:06       When Doug and I, we're doing that. So help me. I'm stuck in here when Duncan and I

Speaker 3:          02:51:10       doing that silly show that Joe Rogan questions everything show. We ran into these people that do think that they have implants in their body that aliens have it and they'll find like some bizarre imperfection, their skin and they'll swear that wasn't there before and that there's something in there and one of them was insanely hot and we got Duncan to talk to her and was like, yeah, I mean

Speaker 2:          02:51:30       probably. I mean, totally makes sense. Good journalists. He was. If it was a ball fat, like, wait a minute, why do you think that that's an alien implant? It's a scratch. I missed that episode. No, you're questioning my journalistic integrity.

Speaker 3:          02:51:54       You were amazing when you talked to the underground bunker guy who was going to start a call now. That was intense, man. I'll never forget driving around in that, underneath that mountain with that guy was a pretty man. God

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       has an underground mountain base like ready for the apocalypse in the space in New Mexico or something where it was. I can't remember man. I just know it's out of nowhere renting. You can rent a space like a park in a parking space and make your camper van, but they had this like underneath this mountain, there's, you know, he'd set up example homes that you could live in, in this paradise. And he kept saying how like there's going to be a wine bar. That's one thing he kept saying, but everyone you know is dead. But there was a woman, but it was weird is that you got out of him that he was kinda be going to kind of be the king. That's right. Yeah. He was, he was going to be in charge man. And he had set up an rv with a little bit of astroturf in front of it and like some playground equipment.

Speaker 1:          02:52:55       So like that's what the future looked like under there. It's like your kids will be able to play in the darkness of this massive cavern, uh, after, after. And he kept saying how they were about to have like an air tight door put in and really, really spooky. There's a lot of different places like that. There's a lot of caverns that people are planning on living in the progress. This guy dig it out or did, was it always those? Uh, the military had used it, the military dug it out there. We're using it as some kind of storage facility. And so he bought it from them and then converted it to this like this. Well, theoretically dystopian future place that you go through to save yourself on the bombs go off. Sounds like an alien movie. Like they just didn't tell them that they're stored alien artifacts in the same location and while they're there that's cool.

Speaker 1:          02:53:48       It comes alive and like we have movement in the corridor. What? It's nothing in the corridor but us, we've double checked and triple checked. Well we just found this manuscript and we're not sure what to make of that. But if that's, it sounds like the movie room to me, you gonna see which rules a room roots. It's about this woman who's like kidnapped by this dude who locks her in a room and rapes her and it's a terrible thing, but she has a kid and the kid doesn't know there's a world outside and so she and she wants a kid to be happy, so she tells them all these stories and all the stuff and the kid grows up in this garage basically thinking like that's the whole world. And you think about it. That's applicable to mean talking about a metaphor, you know, we're told what reality is, we're told what to believe.

Speaker 1:          02:54:37       And so matrix, it's all these things. The Matrix gnosticism. It's the idea that what we are in right now is actually a, an interdimensional prison and we've been trapped by these super advanced beings that have kept us here called the dark are cons and that they like, they like power and authority. And so, um, anybody. So basically this idea, I think it's called Discordian Asm, but the idea is that because we are in an interdimensional prison where we've been had reality like where we like had this consensus reality given to us by people like Bernays, chef Bernays, who whipped up this reality tunnel that we're all existing in a because we are in this situation, uh, anyone in forcing the reality tunnel is a servant of the dark art con. So anybody who's like trying to uphold this bullshit reality that we've all gotten trapped in there actually a form of Satanists.

Speaker 1:          02:55:37       And so as a religion or any time that you do anything to break a ridiculous rule, anytime you do anything to break a mundane law, anytime you do anything to subvert the authority of someone getting off on their power, you are actually taking part in a kind of holy war. And subverting this very ancient and terrible prison that all humanity is trapped in where people parade around as though they have some kind of right to authority. Kings being the classic case, people used it. They somehow convince people that they were gods on earth. Clearly just human beings, the ultimate liars. You're not a god. You're a human who's convinced as that you have some kind of power and so anytime you do anything to subvert those people, whether it's some fucking asshole, he's wearing a crown and is convinced you that ease the divine being sent here or whether it's some son of a bitch and one of those reality shows. He's like going through your pockets for weed. Anytime you do anything to even disrupt that system a little bit, you're doing a holy act in the great war against the interdimensional prison keepers who are keeping us trapped here. Look up this accordion ism. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:56:47       that's awesome. That's it. Three hours in there. I was going to say, I can hear that rant already on youtube that people have already with, with animation and fucking dark lords. Ladies and gentlemen. That's, uh, that's it though. What are we calling this shrimp raid over folks? Thank you everybody much. Love. See you soon. Bye. Bye.

Speaker 8:          02:57:13       That was great. I got up, I got to Pittsburgh.
