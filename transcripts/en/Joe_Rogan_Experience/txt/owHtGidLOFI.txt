Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Sweet jesus. Fuck yeah. The Joe Rogan experience podcast. This is getting boring saying this way. Every time they listen to what I like most about this podcast is it has no professionalism to it whatsoever. So when I have to say the same shit over and over again, I feel like I'm being a professional and I feel like, uh, I'm not doing myself a service. It's nonsense. You know what the fuck it is? We're sponsored. How do we pay the bills? Okay, how do I employ Brian? We have to get money. This is where we get it. We get it from brain pills, Alpha brain. What does Alpha brain, what does Alpha brain, it's cognitive enhancing supplement. It is a, uh, a supplement that has a bunch of the very best nutrients to support neurochemistry. And the idea is that, you know, your body essentially runs on nutrients. It's what you need to have everything functioning optimally, but you can adjust those levels and add things and you can get benefits from it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       And Alpha brain to me is, uh, I, I am fucking, I'm lost without it. If I don't have it, I've, I really do kind of freak out and people think that I've had people say that it's a placebo effect and I say you're fucking crazy. Cause it gives me these most incredibly vivid dreams that I never used to have before. And you know, I think everybody's different. I don't know. I don't know how sensitive you are to your body, but I'm very sensitive. I'm very sensitive to what's working, what's not working, how I feel when I take fish oil, how I feel when I don't take fish oil, my body to Joe. I am sensitive. I'm trying to be sensitive to your soul. Brian tried to be sensitive to as an essence realize that were sponsored by a pharmaceutical company. Well it's not a pharmaceutical comp kind of their vitamins for your mind.

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       Vitamins for your dumb. Well it is kind of crazy because we also sell kettle bells and battle ropes and uh, you're blending it sounds like that, right? Yeah. You're building on fucking army for some reasons and I'm just trying to strengthen up men. All right. Strengthen your mind and your fucking body. And that's what on it's all about what is, I take Alpha brain every fucking day. I definitely take it before every podcast. In fact, they usually do it in the middle of the podcast, which is why I'm at my best. About an hour or so. Anne, what do you got over there? I got only new mood. I don't want to take new meter. And now you've got any of that Alpha brain retarded.

Speaker 1:          00:02:26       I was like the worst commercial for Alpha brain over. I've been hanging out in Ohio. That's why, oh, the drain due again. Those vampires, they got ahold of the courts. We have um, this new shit that's in, it's called hemp force and uh, all the information on any of these things that I don't want to go too in depth because people can play in it. These, these commercials take too long. What we're trying to do it on it is sell you the very best shit possible. As cheap as we can, and to make it as easy as possible. So we have a 100% money back guarantee on your first order of 30 vitamins, 30 pills. It's Alpha brain or new

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       mood, which is a five HTP and l tryptofan supplement that actually boosts your mood. It actually boosts your serotonin levels. And these are all this is, there's a lot of science behind this stuff, but it's very controversial. So if you're interested at all in nootropics, I suggest that you Google the word new tropics and just read on the pros and cons. But to me vitamins are a very important part of my life. I think supplementing has made me a healthier person with a body that functions better period. Um, we also have these kettle bells and battle ropes that are in and I've talked about them Ad Nauseum, but the new news is I will definitely be doing a kettle bell DVD with the Great Steve Maxwell's mate. Yeah, we uh, we went, we did some emails back and forth and uh, Steve is totally down. So we're going to, we're going to do, he's going to, what are we going to do is I'm going to have Steve put me through like one of his brutal workouts and people at home will be able to do it along with them and I, I'm, I'm trying to, I'm trying to do it for too because people, first of all, people keep asking me to do one of these and second of all, because I think people could really benefit from kettle bells.

Speaker 2:          00:04:05       I think it's a more interesting way to work out. It feels more satisfying to me. It's fucking harder. Like when I see someone like just doing bicep curls now I'm like, you silly bitch. Like that's nonsense. Like it's, it's too easy to, to really get like real benefits that you, you see when you roll, when you do Jujitsu, I feel like you have to do something really difficult. You have to do either power lifting, you have to do cleans and presses, you have to do squats, you have to do dead lifts. If you want to like really get a benefit, you have to do that. Or you got to do something like kettle bells. And what I like about kettle bells is you, you got it. You develop amazing core strength because you're essentially balancing this fucking cannon ball and moving it around and it makes your body work intelligently as one unit. And I think you using your body to lift weights as one unit instead of isolating areas to me, shows the best benefits athletically. So all that shit we sell and on at.com,

Speaker 3:          00:05:02       um, the vitamins, what video you're making, Jim kills me and wants to know if you be aware, GSP, I shorts and shorts at GSB. Where's doesn't really tight ones that he wants to know. If you would go do it for him. Okay, I will do that for him. I still love him. Um, anyway, uh, go to [inaudible] dot com use the code. Any Rogan,

Speaker 2:          00:05:17       save 10% off any of the supplements. Um, and, uh, that's including the hemp force. So you go check it out on a.com o. N n I t. And we also want to thank Alienware for providing us with these super dope

Speaker 3:          00:05:29       computers. And I'm now using alien, whereas the computer that I used to watch youtube videos and stuff, so there it's going to be a lot of new shenanigans flow. Excellent. We'll get to see pop up screens. The computers are awesome, but windows can suck it. How about that? How about that? We need to figure out a way to port these bitches over to Mac. Ooh, wait a minute. Fanboys all across the world just went, what the fuck man. I've been playing, I've been playing a future sponsor, uh, on the, uh, like, yeah. I don't know if I can talk about it, but it's

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       pretty cool. You don't know if you can talk about it. I remember the, the gay, the IPAD a game. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll, we'll, we'll soon. Yeah, you've been previewing it and we are, we will soon be sponsored by a new game company. Um, uh, that's making a really bad ass iPad games. Yeah. And I've been using my iPad a lot because of this game, which is, it's kind of weird. It's turned into a game boy almost. Yeah. Almost Twitter. Well this, that should be finalized real shown. All right. So let's roll the podcast Rep. We got a lot of shit to talk about. A lot of shit.

Speaker 5:          00:06:29       Oh, pitch out Rogan experience Joe Rogan podcast all day.

Speaker 4:          00:06:44       Ladies and gentlemen, we are joined by congressional candidate David Seaman. That sounds so, that sounds so official, dude. I know. It feels kind of ridiculous. I was at lunch that day with a friend of mine if we check this and uh, we were talking about it, it just sounds so ridiculous to talk about like your supporters and campaigning and all this. But uh, it's cool in a way, cause I used to be the guy who had just watched TV and be so angry that all of these dumb asses had been in for 20 years and her legislative terrible stuff. So I've just read articles about it and do youtube videos about it. And then a number of things happened and I actually had an opportunity to run. So why not? Why not jump in instead of just being on the sidelines? Yep. Wow. That's, did you feel compelled?

Speaker 4:          00:07:27       Do you feel like a calling me? How old are you? I, I'm a, I'm in my mid twenties. You, you don't want to say I'm 26. Why didn't you want to say uh, cause mid twenties more people can connect with that than 26 we just ruined your entire campaign over buddy. I'm just kidding. I don't know. There's normally, here's why I answered that way. Normally it's a girl who asked me how old I am. And so you can go for like 10 minutes on the guessing game. Oh and you liked that? I liked that. So you treat me like a chick. Well I dare you sir. How dare you run your shenanigans my way dude, I respect you. If you're still running around with a last name like semen and being a young man that had to be brutal. What the fuck was high school? Like? High school was cool.

Speaker 4:          00:08:11       It was middle school is bad. Cause in high school people were like, okay there were over it. Yeah. Like in middle school though, you take the science class where you first learned about like that that happens and people just go wild. They love it. That's it. It was kind of tempered by there's this guy in my same class with the last name either Butkus or but Lik I think it was but lik so like semen was almost a little too. It was a little too obscure for people to grasp but like, but like you could just jump on that and you could, you could really believe that kid. It's funny how weird noises with your mouth like have a different effect on people. Totally. You know, or curse curse words. Like why is something a curse word? It's just something coming out of your mouth. It's, it's almost, to me it's like that's the beginnings of all

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       the beginning of the vault ignorance is this idea that we have bad words. It's like, it's almost like if you can convince people, like if everybody agrees that there's bad words, we all agree there's words you should never say in certain company. If you do that, that's a step step one on the way to be full of shit. And that, you know, it's weird that we still accept that. It's so silly. It's the, those words are important. If people don't use them, they're not as fun to talk to. You know? I don't know. A single person that never swears that's as legitimately fun to talk to is my friends who swear all the time.

Speaker 6:          00:09:30       If you don't swear it all, there's something a little bit wrong with you. Yeah. Uh, cause it's just, it's not the way people speak.

Speaker 1:          00:09:36       It's stupid. It's, it's, it's you by not using it. It's stupid because sometimes it's the fucking word to use. Stop right there. It was extra fucking, you know, you're my mom. There's something wrong with her. Cause she, I, I'll say shit. And she was like, Bryan was like, what sucks by your mom's religious though, Dude. That's where things could get odd. Right. Um, in running for Congress, is that important? Do you have to bring up religion? Is it, do you feel like, uh, you need people on your team?

Speaker 6:          00:10:03       Uh, well, I mean, I have a lot of republican and a lot of democratic supporters and obviously a lot of independence and libertarian minded, but they're not supporting me because of what I believe metaphysically, whatever that may be. There were supporting me just because I want to protect the constitution and defend the bill of rights. And for most people, that's enough right there. And if you believe in those things, you know that my personal beliefs are kind of irrelevant as long as I'm not a member of the League of shadows or something, you know, and like, yeah, as long as your religion isn't harmful to anybody, it doesn't matter if you're an atheist or if you're a skeptic or secular or, you know, extremely. Uh, what's the word? Extremely devout. That shouldn't really matter when you're representing your, your, uh, district.

Speaker 1:          00:10:45       Yeah, I couldn't agree more and I, you know, I really, I've been callous about people's ideas in the past and made fun of silly religions. But the reality is some of the nicest people I know are religious people. I, I have a friend who's a Mormon, is like one of the nicest guys on earth. This, I now have a frozen Scientologists. Oh, I've never seen

Speaker 6:          00:11:06       met Amine Mormon. They're like nice to the point where you're like a little bit upset

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       and they're really charitable. They're like, it's a beautiful religion. If you, if you know people that are Mormons and you see like how much they help each other when there's like a, if there's any sort of a crisis or one family has, how much they chip in, it's a beautiful community. Even if it's based on nonsense. It's a, it's a beautiful community, but you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're nice. You know, if that, I like that guy's my friend. I mean he believes all kinds of wacky shit. They wa they used to wear a special underwear, the whole fucking deal. But he's my friend. He's a nice guy. I don't need him to believe everything. I believe. I just need to be able to interact with him and know that he's got my interest and his interests and everybody's interests at heart. He's not just trying to fuck the whole thing up for himself.

Speaker 6:          00:11:54       Yeah, well I mean personal beliefs. Uh, once you start telling somebody that they can believe in what they can't believe in terms of religion, you're jumping a huge jumping. It's, yeah, it's a very slippery slope.

Speaker 1:          00:12:06       It's so when we, you know, I think the idea is we should be as honest as possible about everything about it. You know, all your own personal beliefs and religion. We should all be as honest as possible. And I think we would come to like a remarkable middle ground if we took away all the ideology. I think we would come to, if we all, if we all got together for the whole world, could speak one language and we sat down and talked about religion, I think we could, we would form a remarkably similar opinions if we're really honest about what the fuck happens when you die and about who has created this earth. It's a massive mystery.

Speaker 6:          00:12:42       Well that, that's the, uh, I'm definitely not religious, but people have asked me, uh, somebody's online on Google plus actually asked me, he was like, do you believe in God this the deal breaker for me it was this atheist. So, and first of all he was, he was, he was posting a comment on a thread that had nothing to do with that. I was writing something about censorship or like Internet censorship. And this is question totally like hijacking what we're talking about, but I wanted to answer him and I said, you know, I believe in a higher power because I really don't want to believe that we're the most advanced thing in the universe. Like this iPhone over there is the, the most high tech incredible thing invented in the whole universe. I just don't believe that. And I don't believe that we're necessarily the highest level of intelligence out there. I don't, you know, and if you look at where we are now, a atheist want you to believe that we came from kind of like toxic sludge billions of years ago, washing up on the shore and it kind of pre oxygenated earth or whatever the details are. And I'd like to think that there's more to life than that. I really would.

Speaker 1:          00:13:42       Well, uh, I would like to too. I don't want to, you don't want, you don't want to, you want to think this is it. This is the fucking floor it and see where it crashes. Absolutely. You know, I think a lot of us would like to think there's something out there that's a, that's smarter than us. I think the real issue is ego is that the human ego is aware of itself. And I think when a person is aware of themselves, when you start thinking of yourself and you want to keep yourself alive, you start looking at yourself like very selfishly and an objectively. You start looking at yourself like you're super, super fucking important. You know? I think if we, if we could get past that and you looked at life and intelligence, you would say, well, why does it have to be coming out of the mouth of some thing that can move around?

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       Why am I assuming that that's the only intelligence? How do I not know that there's not intelligence and stars? How do I not know that there's intent there? There could be hyper intelligence all around us. We're just, we're not capable of hearing it's frequency. We're not capable of communicating with it. Why does this bag of blood and cells and nerve endings and electrical impulses, why does this make noise with its mouth and change the world? Why does it, why the fuck does that happen? Well, who knows? It doesn't make any sense. How do you, how do you not know that there is not an intelligence to everything around us all the time. It's just imperceptible to us and they're starting to figure this out with plants. They're starting to figure out that plants have some sort of rudimentary or a unknown rather, I'm going shouldn't say rudimentary. You might be like really complicated method of communicating with each other. It's fucking, I'm actually, I've actually ready

Speaker 6:          00:15:23       when one of the, one of the trees gets cut down. Hey, send a, like a chemical signal through the roots. The other trees. Yeah. And like warn them or something. Nothing really matters cause you're a tree and you can't go anywhere. But they still, they send out the warning signal, you know? And uh, there's, I don't know if this has been debunked or not, but somebody put out a book a while ago that my aunt was really into and it was like if you're in a room with the plant and you have positive emotions of like, I love this plant, it fares better than a plant where you're like, I need it for this damn thing out.

Speaker 1:          00:15:52       Yeah. They, yeah, I think that's real. I don't even think we might have to Snopes that one. Nope. It cause Snopes tends to be pretty honest about that shit. Although there do seem a little pessimistic. You're saying Snopes once in a while. I was on the rag. I Dunno. Do you think so? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:16:10       Question Snoop Bees, butthole. Do Plants do plants? Do you plants care? Do you plan

Speaker 3:          00:16:18       a positive emotion plant?

Speaker 1:          00:16:21       Yeah. Positive. Yeah. Positive singing to plants, benefits of Po Positive Planet sex people. I wonder if he had sex with lance if they would grow bigger maybe if you just came on your plant. Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:16:35       Sprinkled a little every day on one communication. I put so many, some Gatorade once and it looked like a grease, like twice its size overnight. What? I put some come in and I wipe my come off in with Gatorade and it seemed like it just expanded really big in the Gatorade. So I don't know if there's a chemical reaction between the two, but yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:16:58       this is a, I think I was too vague in my search. People talk to plants. What, what would you say? It's not people talk positive, positive energy or energy around plants. Helping

Speaker 7:          00:17:12       butthole.

Speaker 3:          00:17:13       Is that hurricane hitting Florida right now?

Speaker 6:          00:17:15       Got It. I got out of there. Uh, they offered to change my flight for no fee. Oh, relied. Flew out a day early. Just because you want to be stuck in that. Even if there is nothing big airlines will cancel your flights. Just out of caution.

Speaker 3:          00:17:28       You know, I, I flew on southwest the other day and I just wanted to sleep and the whole time they played games on the intercom and like, like Trivia Games with everyone, they're like, now press your button, that Ding button, you know, like the help me button. It seemed totally illegal because like, what if somebody really needed help, like a heart attack and there's all these people dinging and they're like, no, I'm having a heart attack. You know, a southwest. I don't,

Speaker 6:          00:17:50       I don't like those games. Like, uh, I remember one time, I don't want to like single out and say it was definitely southwest cause I don't, I don't wanna be sued. Right. But I'm like 99% sure it was southwest. Yeah, me too. I'm 99.9 the flight attendant was making some kind of lame joke about like I hope like hopefully we'll land. Right. And I was like, that's like for me, it doesn't matter cause you fly enough times, you know that the odds are in your favor. Right. But every once in a while to get that person who's flying for the first time. Right. And that probably freaks the hell out of that person.

Speaker 3:          00:18:15       Yeah. You almost swore and, and you know, backed off it perfectly though. This is what one of the stewardess said, I'm trying to sleep and they're screaming on Entercom the whole flight. I want to kill people. Like, like, like she says, all right, now take your seatbelt and cross your lips. Oh, I'm in hips and I'm thinking like, did she just meet Pussy lips cause she made like the motion like cross your belt over your, she probably used to be a stripper name. She was a flood trying to sleep

Speaker 6:          00:18:40       America. I was pretty impressed with, uh, I don't know how they're able to do this legally, but everybody was young and had a good attitude. Yeah. And that's like my euphemism for hot women. Uh, and there are other airlines like because of unions and stuff, they're just, they have serious attitude. They hate their job and they're old. They've been there for like 30 years. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:19:00       And or theirs, their standup comics that never made it. And the other, they're trying to material out because they have a captive audience. Who are you gonna do? Like jump out?

Speaker 1:          00:19:09       Joey and I had a guy recently in flying into Denver that has like a whole routine. They're like, how to let go. He was doing stand up. I was like, as a standup, I know when someone's doing standup, like he was doing stand up, he had like a whole routine that it would do like a bunch of one liners about, uh, about travel. It was so silly.

Speaker 3:          00:19:25       There's this one pilot that sings every time he takes off and lands. It's a song that should definitely be legal cause you use using the like using up the airwaves. I know what I'm saying. It's ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:19:37       Do you have it? It's just so gross. Like who are you? This is my plane. I'm not a pilot. Slaps the waitress on it. Her ass was it flight attendant on her ass as he moves into the cockpit, gives his buddy knuckles. I'm going sing to these people. They need to hear my voice and loop brain.

Speaker 3:          00:19:54       It was also so cold and I was like can I please have a blanket? And they're like, we don't have blankets. And I'm like all right. So I had to make one of those like things where you take your arms and put it inside your shirt and then just like make a cocoon and like bundle up in a corner because it was so freezing on the plane. Why they're doing this.

Speaker 1:          00:20:09       How healthy could it be being a pilot you just flying up and lasted by radiation. Plastic by radiation in front of like a window.

Speaker 6:          00:20:20       Yeah. It makes me want to play trivia games or the inner comments. He knows how much radiation is involved in, in plane flight. Do you know? Uh, I heard something like a cross country is like the equivalent of a chest x ray or something. It's not, it's not, it's nothing. It's just the fact if you're flying every single day as they do it, my dad up and uh, radiation is not as bad for you as people make it out to be like the Fukushima style stuff is definitely really bad for you. But in terms of like, just low ambient doses, you're getting radiation

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       just walking outside. I make sure everything I read somewhere like in a kitchen with a marble top that's giving off radiation. Yeah. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. Yeah. I was watching some documentary on TV where they were talking about dinosaur bones. Some of them being radioactive. They need a coat them with lead paint to try to reduce the amount of radioactive energy that came off. I don't know. Right. It's horse shit or not. It sounds, it sounds silly, but it actually makes sense if the dinosaurs died, you know, from some sort of a, um, uh, a meteor impact or something like that, that there was some mean 6,000 and 6,000 years ago, right? Yeah. How long has a half life for that stuff? They said, no, I'm saying the dinosaurs 6,000 years ago, it was at least 6,060 6,000 or more. How do you deal with that question?

Speaker 4:          00:21:30       Is Anybody ever, for folks who don't know what the fuck we're talking about, serious fundamentalists believed that the earth is 6,000 years old? I think the way I'd answer is I'd be like, I definitely believe there were dinosaurs on the planet 6,000 or more years ago. I don't believe they're tricked by the devil. I don't believe like dinosaur fossils are there to confuse us and like question our faith. I think they're there because their dinosaur fossils, Bill Hicks had a great joke about that. It doesn't make you, it doesn't it bother you. The God might be fucking with you. God might be fucking with your head. That's such a great bit about God burying dinosaur bones and Giggling, like, figure this out. Now he's questioning your faith. That's what's all that's hilarious. That is one of the most beautiful ways to shut down new ideas. It's Satan questioning your faith.

Speaker 4:          00:22:16       Yeah. Yeah. You can't let that 6,000 year thank go. Okay. We know more now period. You can't trust what was in a book that was written by people who, you know, we're deciphering it from several other different languages. Also, by the way, it didn't immediately go to English. It had to be translated from Hebrew to Latin to grid and a lot of shit missing from that man. Maybe that's 6,000 years is a figure of speech, you know? Yeah. I wondered about that. Like you look at a Wikipedia entry and here we have, we have digital content where you transfer something and it's 100%, uh, intact back then. You're just doing it by hand and like you have other issues going on. Maybe you get hit with plague and shit. Fuck the editors get wiped out. But like whenever you copy something from book to book, they're going to be big changes.

Speaker 4:          00:23:00       Just that of like it's what happens, accidents, you know? Yeah, yeah. So true. There's no way you can spread information on the back of animal hides for a thousand years and have that shit come out perfect. It's kind of let that 6,000 year thing go. Well, it's wild. It just like for 400 years ago, people really thought that a or the, I don't know if they've thought this, they were told that the earth was the center of the universe. Yeah. And you know, these people were not any dumber than we are today. Like biologically the same brain and people were doing smart stuff back then, but they had to like buy in at this collective bullshit. Like, Oh yeah. Uh, it is, we're definitely the center of the university even though we know that that's not the case. And back then if you said something, if you came out with new information

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       that showed that the current model was completely false, they will put you in jail or kill. You just accept it. You weren't allowed to just come out and say, hey man, I think that we're spinning around it and it's one of a bunch of them. Yeah. We weren't allowed to say that. They were like when gout, there wasn't Galileo was put under house arrest and

Speaker 6:          00:24:07       yeah, he was under house arrest. I mean it was considered heresy, right?

Speaker 1:          00:24:09       Yeah. You new information. Is he considered like say tannic? They wanted to, what's really exciting if you, I mean ridiculous. Rather if you stop and think about that, like they just won the block down information so bad that if you had some new stuff they wouldn't even consider it. It was the work of the devil. They had it locked down. They know exactly what was up. That kind of confidence is so ridiculous.

Speaker 6:          00:24:32       Well, it might've been lack of confidence actually, because if you acknowledge that, okay, you guys are right, the earth is just this insignificant thing in a much bigger picture, then maybe people go, what about the pope? Do we still have to pay homage to them? Or could that be a typo? Also, you know, uh, that's awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:24:48       One of the most ridiculous things ever that like foreign dignitaries and presidents and prime ministers, they have to sit down and meet with the fucking pope. They have to sit down and meet with this cult leader who's dressed like a wizard in a star wars episode. I mean, it's the most ridiculous idea ever that this guy should still be dressing like this and 2012 and we should still pretend that he's holy. We should still pretend that he's got the Willy Wonka golden ticket to Jesus's fucking factory fuck house. It's unbelievable, man. It's unbelievable that that still works. That kind of stuff is preposterous. That kind of stuff is, that's mind boggling. It's not whether or not there's a god, it's not whether or not, you know, the idea of higher power exists. Of course it does. He would be crazy to think that some higher intelligent might be at the end of all this, why not?

Speaker 1:          00:25:43       Who we are. Look how much change we enact on our environment and we do it thoughtfully. We do it whether it's reasonable or not, we're thinking about it while we're doing it. And when, when even when you throw garbage in the ocean, you're thinking about when you do that, why wouldn't we assume that there's some sort of an intelligence to galaxies? Why wouldn't we assume that? You know, just cause it can't talk English. That's so arrogant to me. I, it's crazy to think that we're the only intelligence just because we can clearly communicate with each other but can't communicate with other things.

Speaker 6:          00:26:14       Yeah. That's like, uh, how they test for intelligence in schools at the sat test. So you get somebody who's good at memorizing facts and filling out bubbles and it doesn't count it off of that person who's like truly a genius at painting or designing websites or doing things that are ultimately like much more lucrative than filling out a bubble test me.

Speaker 1:          00:26:33       Well Rosie. Yeah. Brian is a good example. I mean you, you did say that as a Chug, but you are a good example. Like you're great at what you do. I fucking hate math. Imagine if you had to do something else. What if you had to be a lawnmower guy? And what if you got to be a guy who mows lawns? How good would you be at that? He would fucking suck at that. What does some people, you know, certain things have no appeal to them. They have no desire to do it for other people. Other people love mowing lawns. Okay? Some, I know dudes who are landscape artists, they're fucking artists, man. They put together like the put the plants in the right place and they range the flowers perfectly, cut everything. And it creates this really nice aesthetic. Like when a guy does it, your, your front lawn and you know, if there's a guy across the street from my house who has like little gnomes and shit, puts all these little things in front of me, he's creating light little work of art out there that guys compelled to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:27:26       And Man, everybody's compelled to do different shit. The real problem is that we don't recognize that. We're always trying to push people into areas where they're not compelled. You know, we're trying to tell people, you can't be a professional skateboarder. There's no money in that. Then you go, what the fuck is Tony Hawk? Who's that guy? Why is that guy's, that guy's fucking huge. Okay, how come he don't tell me there's no money in it? There's money in it. Just stop telling me what to do. I'm going to do this. I'm going to try to do that.

Speaker 6:          00:27:51       Well, people have such a weird attitude. Like, uh, I told people I was coming out here, do your show and to do a couple of meetings. And uh, they're like, so if somebody's paying you to go out there and I'm like, are you serious? Like I'm going to be in front of millions of people. And I'm like, that's the first question in your mind is going to be, am I being paid to come out? You know? And people really think like that. Like you asked them to do something and it's like, well, is this on the, is this on the payroll? You know, and you're like, just fucking do it. You know, like if it's something important, you should do it. Like there are a lot of people who they want to be in a cubicle and get paid on a time schedule. That's all they want. And if they encounter somebody who's not on that same, that same, uh, thought process of, I wonder what my annual salary this year is going to be, then they're confused. Like, wait a second, why aren't you maximizing year available work hours? You know?

Speaker 1:          00:28:41       Yeah. That's, we want to know that we have a certain amount of money

Speaker 6:          00:28:45       coming in every month. Yeah. I mean that, that's normal. That's just like not wanting to starve. Yeah. But then there are people who, uh, took anything that's coming out of a place of passion or a place of civic duty. It's like, what does that all about? You know, like, uh, the TSA for example, whenever I rant about them on Twitter or on one of my articles on business insider, I get a couple of people who always say they're just doing their jobs, leave them alone. I'm like, that's, that's the justification given for some of the most evil stuff that's been done on this planet. We're just doing our jobs. Find a job that doesn't violate people's constitutional rights. You know, find a job where you can go home at night and not be like embarrassed about you're doing all day and for the money they're making, whatever they're making, it's not enough to just totally infringe on other people's basic rights. And I feel that way. Like it's not all about the money. It has to be the money and doing something that you're okay with.

Speaker 1:          00:29:36       I don't think, I don't, first of all, um, I don't think it's the fault of the Tsa. I think first of all, that's an incredibly difficult job. Whenever you're trying to search people shit, when they're on their way somewhere, that's a difficult job because what if someone does get through with a bomb when, if someone does get through some shit that can it like the inside of the plane on fire we got, he gets a real problem and we live in a fucked up time. We really do. We do live in a fucked up time, but these people that are working there, man, they're just people with jobs. The people that are running the whole thing must be responsible. Yeah. Yeah. Whenever, whenever you have a problem with somebody, it's the people at the top. You, you give people a job like that. Like you gotta make sure nobody has a bomb.

Speaker 1:          00:30:19       Like all right, you know, like sir, listen to me sir. Like people don't want to listen to you. It's a, people naturally get a little bit douchey. Everybody you meet is NOI to meet you all day long. There are no aid to be in front of you that annoyed you just getting this fucking cancer ray from them all day long. So I think we need to figure out a way, first of all, to make it like way less intrusive on people. Definitely. Well it's more realistic to like old people and babies and shit really. Is this baby a terrorist? Yeah. Quiet. You know, it's one of the only,

Speaker 6:          00:30:50       for a lot of people it's one of the only times where you meet the federal government face to face, you know, representative of the federal government. And it's normally not a pleasant encounter. Like you said, they're annoyed. Yeah. You're either annoyed or scared. Uh, it could be an awesome experience. It could be like, wow, the government is looking out for me. This is efficient. This is a decent use of tax dollars. But instead I get the opposite feeling. I'm discussed that every time I go through with that. Well, it's the same with tourists. Like people come to the U S and they don't want to come back because if you're a visitor, you get treated even worse. If you're like automatically you get the Kiefer Sutherland treatment and like they think you're a threat until you prove otherwise. Yeah. We're, we're a nation of cons.

Speaker 1:          00:31:31       I don't think I'm watching it. I'm not going to campaign on that. Don't do it. It wouldn't help. But it's, it's, it's so frustrating. It's really frustrating. We will stop and think about it. Could you imagine the baby's war terrorist? Oh Gosh. It's terrible. First, the first terrible thing is that we have to worry about someone pulling, uh, you know, a stunt like that, that dude did, uh, when to tried to light his underwear on fire. What is he trying to do? Lighter shoes on fire from that guy on. Everybody had to take their shoes off.

Speaker 6:          00:31:59       The thing with al Qaeda is they really don't seem to try the same thing multiple times. Like nine 11 happened. If we're going to just stick with the official story and not delve into crazy alternative possibilities, which are definitely possibilities based on the research. I've done. But uh, if you're going with the official story, uh, this took them years to plan out and it works. Not because they were geniuses. It works because it's like running up to the biggest kid on the playground and just unexpectedly kicking him in the nuts. Like, that's going to work because he's not expecting it. You know, it's not going to work a second time or third time. But they did something that was totally unexpected and that's why it worked. Not because they were brilliant masterminds and then they try completely different, you know, the underwear bomb or the a shoe bomb and that's it. Next time we shouldn't even be looking at airports. Honestly, the next threat is going to be something, whatever it is, I would put my money up being something completely different from that.

Speaker 1:          00:32:52       Yeah. And then the idea is that the more rights they take away from us, the less likely that is to happen.

Speaker 6:          00:32:58       But it's still real bad guys. Real bad. Whether or not something's going to happen is that illegal legal, the pet on the next year. Crazy. A crepe. Creepy pastor. You can't do that. Man, I can't bet on shit. Although there are like in London, there's that bedding house where you can bet on anything and he'd be like, what are the odds that Madonna, we'll get like an STD in the next 18 months and there's an, or whatever it is, there's a wager on it in England and help do that kind of stuff like that. Those crazy bets.

Speaker 1:          00:33:27       Good idea. I'm sure he would. Yeah. Stan herb and I, by the way, are doing a, uh, end of the year, um, December 21st end of the world, Mayan calendar, apocalypse show in Hollywood. We're going to do it at the Wiltern theater in Hollywood. It's going to be me, Joey Diaz, Stan hope and honey honey. Wow. That's going to be so fucking great. Yeah, we're working it all out now, but it'll be at the Wiltern December 21st. I don't think tickets are not on sale yet, but it's going to be fucking crazy. Oh. And we're at the ice house this weekend. We had to cancel, um, this show at Mandalay Bay because of the UFC got cancelled the first time ever. And, uh, so we moved the show to the ice house. Friday is 10 o'clock and Saturday is 10 30, I believe. Or is it the other way around?

Speaker 1:          00:34:13       Tenish ice has comedy.com to get tickets to their greatest club in the world. This place, it's, it's run by the nicest people ever. It's in Pasadena. And the, uh, the way this place is set up, it's, it's basically the same club that was here in the 1960s. It's amazing. It's like a slice of history and a, and we love it. So we hear all the time. So this weekend it'd be me, Joey, and Ari and, uh, it will be just like a regular real show, you know what I'm saying? Or it's just come on down. So, uh, David Seaman, I'm sorry. We, we, uh, we went off track there. No, you've been a, you've been off bear for a while, right? So you're trying to catch up. Yeah. Yeah. We were in a vacation mode last week. So you're, um, you're, you're running for Congress out of Florida. Yes sir. And when you're, when you're doing that, what do you have to do? Like how do you get your word out? Do you or do you go door to door? Like how do you let people know? Do you just put out an internet videos? Like what's your method of a,

Speaker 6:          00:35:11       I never leave the apartment now I believe, you know, like right now we're actually trying to build national awareness. So it does involve a lot of internet stuff and doing TV shows and local radio shows and uh, that's the best way to hit people. Like it makes you sound like, uh, like you're lazy and you're like, I just do that. But I mean we also go out and talk to actual people and shake hands and all that stuff. But you do that, you're exhausted by the end of the day. You've talked to some crazy, you've only made a difference. You've made a difference of like, now 20 people know who you are. Versus like somebody who's like, you want to do a radio show and like, you know, they call your cell phone and you, you lie and say it's a land line. Because, you know, they call your cell phone, you talk to some dude for 10 minutes and you're like, okay, now 10,000 people in this area know about my campaign.

Speaker 6:          00:35:57       That's a hell of a lot better than shaking hands with the crazy people. Yeah. But you need to do both because you can't be this disconnected like media personality. You have to actually know what you're talking about. Especially when somebody hits you with a local issue, you gotta be right on top of that. And the best way to know about that is by talking to people. Yeah, that's a really good point man. So it's not either or. It's both. You know that you gotta be hands on and you also have to be the online method of distribution is the new way. I mean for everything for standup comedy for, and you still gotta you still gotta suck up to mainstream media. Even though I hate them. I was like, I mean CNN and Msnbc won't have me. I don't think they'll have me on, cause I've trashed them so many times on Twitter.

Speaker 6:          00:36:35       But there are a couple of cable networks that liked me and having me on and they're like my lifeblood for getting the word out about this stuff. You know? What is your main beef with mainstream news? What is a, what is the main problem you have with it? A total lack of a sense of scale. Like there'll be like we have controversial, controversial, new tweets from Justin Bieber after the break and you're like, you're like, you're like, this is really Fox News or this is really MSNBC, you know? Or like Paul Ryan's budget plan might affect us in 10 years and you're like, okay, let's, that's fine for a segment. But what about covering the massive protests that are happening around the country that I have to tune in to on like some live streams site that somebody sends me an email and I see people not much older, not much younger than me getting the shit kicked out of them, especially girls for some reason.

Speaker 6:          00:37:22       I see a lot of that and this is all happening. I'm like, this is incredible. And you look at the bottom and it's like 6,000 people watching 7,000 people watching 8,000 people watching and you're like, any second, this is going to be on CNN and I've done this a million times. You turn on the TV and you're like, okay, say something about the protests, not a single word. And it starts to creep you out and you're like, maybe they know about this and they're just not saying anything because a lot of people send in tips. A lot of people tweet CNN and email CNN and a email producers, they're like, I know how to work with TV producers. If for some reason those handful of networks just don't want to cover what's happening in this country. They don't want to cover a civil unrest. They don't wanna cover police beating people and they don't want to cover anything that Congress has been working on over the past eight months.

Speaker 6:          00:38:02       Uh, I've not heard much coverage of this stuff. Yeah, it's disturbing. When you find out how many different places are experiencing this massive amount of civil unrest, it's happening all over the world. I think they can just control it. Like if it's not until it's on the evening news, it's not really a thing. Like somebody might, you know, post about it on Twitter or Facebook, but you're able to, it's not legit. Yeah. You're able to cognitively be like, well that's just Chris or that's just Amy there. They've always been Weirdos, you know. And then once it's on TV, it's real because it's this collective thing. And a, just a quick shout out, a current TV

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       and our current TV and rt America have kicked ass. They're actually covering this stuff. They're covering the protests. They had been covering Nda and uh, uh, Sopa and Cisco and all of these crazy bills that Congress is working on. They're actually doing what all the TV networks, uh, used to do. Well, you know, we can do is all of us can start paying attention to them and not paying attention to exactly. Exactly. We have to figure out who the fuck has a Nielsen box get inside that guy's head and go, listen man. CNNS ratings are down tremendously. The down like 50% over the past year. Really. And it gives her science, cause people just don't buy it anymore. They're always going to have that person out there who wants to watch, uh, like a political shout fest, you know? Right. But there are a lot of people who would just rather look for news on Twitter or look for news on Google News.

Speaker 4:          00:39:22       I mean at least Google News. Like you type in protest and you see real articles about what's happening. Uh, so it's a better way to get your information. Do you think what's happening is that because of the spread of information through the Internet and we've realized how they've done business as usual the whole time, they have denied attention to a lot of really important things, but we didn't have any other way to get the information out. Like if there's something happening in the Congo, like I didn't know anything about Liberia until I watched the vice guide to Liberia and I was like, Holy Shit. Like what a crazy part of the world. This is. Why didn't I get that from any other sources as well, you know? No, their sources had it on and it was not on CNN. It wasn't, I mean they wouldn't air a show like that.

Speaker 4:          00:40:05       It's almost like in in them having the power, they ultimately became corrupt. Even if you have the, your idea is that you want to, you know, do some sort of a news thing if you're not monitored, if no one, no. Like in the day back now, everything is so transparent. But back then you weren't monitored. You put on whatever you wanted to put on. Whenever the government told you to put on whatever deals he had made the put on. I think you're partially right. I think a part of the reason why we feel like there's so much bad stuff going on today is that we have access to it. And back then you had three, three TV networks, not even cable. You just said that the three networks and they told you what you were supposed to be worried about and that was it. Alice, you're going gonna get information, the newspapers and same thing there.

Speaker 4:          00:40:50       But I think also there's a big aspect of it that things really are accelerating. And getting worse. Some of those things they're drafting and congress are things that a previous generation would have just said, hell no. Like this is like the people in Congress wouldn't have thought of drafting it and people hearing about it one way or another would have not tolerated it well. We have a much higher tolerance right now for corruption and for bad legislation than we used to. Is that because we're too distracted? What do you think? That's, that's my guess is we're distracted and things were still good right now for a lot of people, like if you can pay your rent and uh, you know, you can watch a hundred channels on online or on cable, you're constantly entertained and as long as you're not starving and as long as you're not bored, you're not going to go out in the streets

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       and protests, losing your right to a trial or losing any of these things that we've lost over the past eight months. And that's with a lot of people don't realize is national defense authorization act that got passed, which is what really is, is an act of treason. I mean it's, it's, you could think of no other way to describe it

Speaker 6:          00:41:50       to be high treason. Like that's what I'm saying. Like if this, if in the sixties or the seventies, uh, if the people found out that, oh, by the way, a Kennedy drafted something that would take away your right to a trial,

Speaker 1:          00:42:02       allow him, knew, imprison you on suspicion alone for the rest of your life. People would be like, what? No way that we're supposed to trust them. That they're only going to use it on people who deserve it. They're only going to do it on bad guys. It doesn't happen. Don't, don't worry about it, Mike. It doesn't, it's not about you. We're just worried about terrorists. We're not going to use to say, oh yeah, and also that's, that's not the role of the government the first place. It's like, it's not, it's like I'm going to have a, I'm going to have your girlfriend and my bed, but don't worry about it. Nothing's going to happen. It's like, well, that's not an option in the first place. Yeah. You know, you doing these things is not something that's constitutional begin with. So your intentions don't really matter.

Speaker 1:          00:42:36       It's frightening that that could ever get past. It's really frightening and it just shows you how when people are in power, when they're in positions of power, they do everything they possibly can to hold it and we'll you sense a trend of this, what the trend is. Information is coming in and people are having much more access to all sorts of things and ultimately the Internet is going to represent how people communicate and how people express anything, whether it's voting, whether it's decided. I mean that's how it should be. It should pretty sure if she'll be, we should be able to figure out how to make each human being have a bio identifiable characteristic. Whether it's looking in their eyes are registering their finger. You everybody should have that shit on their fucking laptop and we should all be able to vote online because then things would be a whole lot different. That is the future and they don't have that yet and it's real close. So these fucking assholes that are running things are just holding on tooth and claw. And the way they're doing that is by pulling rights away and they're doing it under the guise of, of helping us, which is fucking disgusting.

Speaker 6:          00:43:40       It is. And I have a theory that I've never said anywhere else before, but you were talking about how, uh, you know, they're taking away rights. People are kind of wising up and they're no longer tolerating it because information is getting out. Uh, I wouldn't stay click my reputation on this, but my theory is that, uh, it got to the point with Bush eight years of Bush, it's where the, they knew that the people just were not having it anymore. They're sick of funding wars. They're sick of this Patriot Act stuff, the whole thing. Right. Uh, and then Obama came along draped and hope and change and very positive message. And uh, people put their support behind them and thought they were getting something brand new. And when really he's backed by the same people who backed Bush, essentially the same kinds of interests and a, so you had a couple of years there where people let their guard down and meanwhile the same stuff has been happening, taking away more rights.

Speaker 6:          00:44:30       The Patriot Act not stopped being used. A 300,000 people have been around 300,000 people have been served nsls uh, and they might be spying on hundreds of millions of Americans. I had so much more confidence in us when I was really young during the Clinton administration. I had so much more confidence in what the government would and wouldn't do to civilians to its civilization. I remember, uh, I remember this girl in my class, her dad worked on the Hubble Space Telescope and he came to our school to talk about it and like there was a camera crew there from the TV stations and stuff. I remember thinking how cool this is. Like government is funding this crazy thing that is going to make a difference in like move us forward. You know, it's like, this is amazing. And now I don't feel that way about a lot of programs. Like now I'm constantly being sent articles where you just kind of a disbelief like the, you've probably read about this, the DRP, the national defense resources preparedness, uh, executive order.

Speaker 6:          00:45:30       What is that? So a reader sent this to me and you always follow tips regardless of what they are. I read through this thing, it's an executive order from Obama and uh, I was like, this is, this is bullshit. This must be made up somehow. But then I went on the White House website on whitehouse.gov where they have to publish the executive order is word for word. I read through it and I was like, Whoa, this makes no sense. He's claiming powers that no president should claim. The ability to, uh, nationalize whole companies are nationalized industries and take personal property and land and really take in, do whatever his administration wants. All they have to do is claim they're preparing for a national emergency. There doesn't have to be proof that there's a national emergency on the way that doesn't actually have to be a national emergency.

Speaker 6:          00:46:17       Uh, the national emergency can just be him declaring that there might be one of the national emergency could be the threat of terrorist. Yeah, exactly. It could be just this looming threat of terrorism and then it's white. So I'm sorry. But that's, that's the scariest thing about having that sort of an enemy. You can kind of claim it's everywhere, right? Well and the NDA part of the languages until hostilities end. So what does that mean? It's like when, when there's not a single violent person on the earth, whoever commits a crime or turns to violence against innocent people, then we'll, we'll stop detaining people without a trial. What is the exact language until has still yes. Go on. Go on. Belligerent act.org. I'm not affiliated with them, but uh, it's just this one page site does a great job of breaking down the exact language until hostilities.

Speaker 6:          00:47:00       That so creepy. Can you bring that up and uh, sure. Read it. Cause they do a good job of highlighting this. It again, it's belligerent, act.org because there are a lot of people, when I was covering this stuff with like, I want to see the exact language, you don't know what you're talking about, and I was like, well, this is based on the [inaudible] analysis and Amnesty International's analysis and you know, et Cetera. They're like, I don't care. I still want to see the exact language. Belligerent and that website does a good job of showing people like, here are the exact words that were signed into that affect

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       you. I don't want to read this man. I'm going to get depressed. I can't get a lot of the rich, you can't spell belligerent. He sleep bitch. It's two L's.

Speaker 7:          00:47:39       Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:47:45       be contained indefinitely without trial. Wow. It's just so weird.

Speaker 1:          00:47:51       It makes it legal to incarcerate United States citizens without recourse to any form of judicial process. Just that alone. Yeah. That's crazy. What do you mean? Why do we have a, why don't we have a judicial branch if you're not going to use it? The idea that you would allow someone to sign a law that says they can incarcerate United States citizens without recourse of any form. There's nothing you can do. They can lock you up for the rest of your life and that's written down somewhere and we're just, because it's written down somewhere, that doesn't mean it's not crazy, but the fact that they even thought that they could be able to pass that, that that would be something that you could put into law. What, what life in prisons. Not Enough. We already have that. You know, it was there that Martin Luther king quote talks about how he talks about how there's a difference between, uh, breaking the law and like abiding, I'm missing it.

Speaker 1:          00:48:42       Messing up his quote entirely. It basically like, just because it's a law doesn't make it just, and just because it's just, it might not necessarily be the law, you know, you might be doing something that's against the law, but it's the just thing to do. And at the same time a law might be profoundly unjust just because somebody signed a piece of paper, as you said, that doesn't mean that we should ruin thousands of people's lives over it. It's completely ridiculous and it's the only reason why it's here is because this is the old way. This is the way things were done, the way things were done, it was very difficult to change laws and things were written in fucking stone and that was what it was. And people are evolving, culture's evolving. Our understanding of our world is changing and ever moving forward and our laws should reflect that.

Speaker 1:          00:49:27       And it shouldn't be the opposite of that if, if there's a tightening down. Well, that to me is a great example of how there's someone who doesn't get it and there's someone who doesn't get it, is the people that are actually running shit, they have the wrong intentions. They're not looking at this correctly. You shouldn't be trying to tighten up. You should be trying to help all the things that are fucked up about the world. That's what we should be using our resources for, and there's money in that as well. By the way, there's jobs in that as well, by the way. There's jobs in any direction you take. I mean the t the TSA is creating jobs. I'd rather see people employ more, employ more people over at NASA. I would like to see that too. I would like to see that much more than I would like to see us go into foreign countries and invade their soil. But I think what's really scary to me is that people are allowed to make these decisions without the will of the American people behind them. This is literally drafted behind closed doors and people had no input. It's terrifying. And how did find out about this?

Speaker 6:          00:50:28       A reader sent me a thing about it and it was, it was a link to a, an article that wired had done back in I think early December. It might've even been November. And so I did a youtube video about it. I did some articles and I felt like there's no way this thing will actually become law, but it's still disturbing. I have to keep an eye on it and tell people about it. And then, uh, Obama Obama came out and said his administration came out and so that they were going to veto it. And then I was like, all right, good. This is what should happen. You know, something ridiculous as proposed and they say, we're not signing this. And then on New Year's Eve a while, everybody's out drinking and not paying attention to these things, he signed it into law. And then after that I took some heat for that and he said, well, I'm not going to use what I just signed into law. I'm not going to use that section. And he issued a signing statement saying that he wasn't gonna use it. But, uh, the problem with that is it's not legally valid. It's like doing something and then putting a post it note on somebodies door saying, sorry about that. Like the signing statement is not a [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:51:24       Legally they said he wouldn't sign it and he signed it. Why am I going to believe that he's not going to use it after he said he's not

Speaker 6:          00:51:31       right. And then it gets even worse because then it goes to federal court. Uh, plaintiffs including a former war correspondent, uh, Chris Hedges used to work at the New York Times and, uh, Daniel Ellsberg who leaked the Pentagon papers. Uh, these are pretty credible people. These aren't like quacks, you know, uh, they filed a court case thinking, uh, with the intention of blocking this because they said that MDA could basically endanger their safety and the safety of any journalist. You know, if the government doesn't want you talking about something, let's just detain them without a trial problem solved. Uh, and the federal court judge Catherine forest ruled it unconstitutional. So again, it should have stopped there. But Obama's administration, his lawyers are now appealing that, uh, appealing that temporary injunction. And so every single step of the way, you're like, wait, if he doesn't want it, why does it keep pushing for it? You know,

Speaker 1:          00:52:23       so disturbing. So it's just reeks of corruption and it reeks of the worst intentions. It reeks of looking at us like we're sheep to be control of the intentions are to crush dissent to cross.

Speaker 6:          00:52:38       There's the assumption that these protests will continue to grow in, in relevance and in size, and there's the assumption that the economy, if there's not some kind of economic collapse, who knows? It could just be years of slow employment and years of people being unsatisfied and that's, even if that's not a total calamity, that's still a breeding ground for like mass civil unrest and they've think if we have this ability to imprison people without a trial, just on our say, so that's going to crush dissent pretty fast. The first thousand people will be arrested

Speaker 1:          00:53:08       and put in prison. That's the end of it. No more protesters because nobody else is going to go out of their house. Well, what's crazy though is that the people who are arresting the people are on the same side as those people. They're just people that are working, they're working folks, the cops and the soldiers. Those aren't the people pulling the fuck strings.

Speaker 2:          00:53:25       The people that are going to have to do the arresting, whether it's military police or whether it's regular police, those are just fucking citizens with jobs. They're not the power problem. They're not the people making the actual calls. That's a small group of people that we could easily overpower. Yeah. Well that's why I was not, I'm not calling for a revolution

Speaker 6:          00:53:45       when I have, when I have trouble with the TSA. Well now that I'm running for Congress, like it's a little bit better because if they, if they harass me too much, they're actually interfering with the democratic process. Like they're making it so that I can so that I can't catch my flight and can't go to a fundraiser. I can't go to a media interview. That's a big deal, you know. Has anyone ever done that? No. It's been pretty good. Uh, do you worry about that? I don't worry about it. I'm just, uh, what I, what I worry about is what I actually experienced every time, which is I politely opt out of the new screeners because those give off radiation and they'd been banned in Europe. The European Union has banned this kind of scanner cause they don't know the long term health effects of shooting radiation into your body.

Speaker 6:          00:54:24       A backscatter radiation. Uh, it, it's a different form of radiation. Then a chest x rays, I believe, I'm not an expert on this, but it's different because it's doing a different thing. It's taking a photo of basically the outside of you instead of just blasting right through your body to show your bones on an x ray. So as a result, it's a different kind of radiation. And uh, so anyway, these machines freak me out to the point where I don't, my testicles going through that, uh, every single time I get on a flight. So I politely opt out and there's a sign right there that says, if you'd like to opt out, let us know. Uh, I opt out and then you're treated, uh, in a way that's not very good. They say, we have an opt out, sir. Stand over there like you've done something wrong, right?

Speaker 6:          00:55:03       It's not like, okay, cool. Just give us a second. We'll get to it. It's all about the attitude. They said we have an opt out. Stand over there. And then travelers behind you see that going on and they're like, shit, I'm not going to opt out. I'm just going to go through this thing. And I'm gonna let my kids go through it too. I think that's what they're trying to get. Yeah. No. And then you get the invasive pat down where you have to put your arms up by your sides and you put your arms down after a couple of minutes because you're tired and you've just been on a long or you're about to get on a long flight. And uh, they say sir, hands back up, put them back up and they guy sticks his fingers down your belt and a ahead. It was belt. Yes, he does.

Speaker 6:          00:55:39       He do like a scissors on the tip of your director. He actually does touch the tip, like you feel you feel pressure against the tip of your penis. Wow. And that's too much for the government to be doing. That's not their role. You know, uh, like it's great that you're trying to keep us safe and trying to keep airports curity at a high level. That's not your role. Nobody asks you to do that. You shouldn't be doing that. It's unconstitutional. And so every time I'm like, should I just go through the fucking scanner and get it over with? But every time I go, no, I have to hold to this. Cause if you, if you give them a pass on this, then at what point do you just lose all of your, uh, your compass there, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:56:18       Yeah, I could see people like pilots and, and people that didn't actually have to go through it, right?

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       They have a different line. They have a different line. And also if you pay something like 100 bucks, you can now get an expedited screening. Got To do a background check beforehand. I find that profoundly unconstitutional to cause you're classing citizens, what does this, the titanic, you know, if you have extra disposable income, we're not going to screen you as closely as the masses. It's ridiculous. I can't agree more. I think it's so weird. I was a in London the other day and I was really tempted to do it because there's two who's just, there's a big ass line. This dude just walked in with that pre and snuck right through. Didn't even have to take his shoes off. It was like, but I'm just like, what kind of access to they have when you, what do they look for when you go in and submit something like that and know want to listen to your cell phone 24, seven. Is that what you're agreeing to? Just so you can, well then make sure doing that just about, anyway, that's not really happening. So

Speaker 6:          00:57:12       Nsa thing, uh, there was a video about this and the New York Times website recently, it was an amazing video, is like eight and a half minutes long professionally produced, uh, where they interviewed the NSA whistleblower who everybody's kind of heard something about, but you don't know his actual, you know, what he's saying happened. And this video lays it all out there. It's amazing journalism. Like, I don't know why the New York Times didn't put it on their homepage where it belonged, but it still got out there. You know, it was on reddit and like all these social media sites and they did a good job of showing people that, uh, I'll just boil it down. Um, this NSA whistleblower, his name is William Binney, and he was at that agency for 32 years. Uh, and he was actually the technical director there, so he was pretty high up.

Speaker 6:          00:57:55       He wasn't like just the analyst or a janitor or something, you know, he knew what was going on and he's about as high up as you can get. And, uh, so he says that after nine 11, the NSA went from using their incredible power to monitor stuff overseas, which is their mandate to do that, uh, you know, tap into satellite phones and tap in overseas internet traffic and all of that stuff. They went from doing that to turning this incredible, uh, surveillance weapon against our own people. And it became a full blown effort to record pretty much everything that we're doing here in the u s uh, and that includes, uh, every citizen who has access to the internet or a cell phone and the way they get around this because it appears to be blatantly unconstitutional. The fourth amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures.

Speaker 6:          00:58:44       Um, they have an interpretation from what the whistleblower was saying in this video or from the article. They have an interpretation that we're not actually violating your fourth amendment rights because we're only taking this information in and storing it in our databases. We're not actually, there's nobody with, you know, a pair of headphones and a computer screen in front of them who's watching you type every email and actually looking through all of your stuff. We're just saving this. But the problem with that is it's saved, uh, and it's tied to your name and all they have to do. It's not a big logical leap to think, uh, if you're running for Congress and you might be running on a platform, you want to doubt, you want to defund some of these programs, they go, let's look. Let's look into this guy. You know, they type in your name and they suddenly see all of your emails, all of your phone calls, all of your associations, because that's part of what it does.

Speaker 6:          00:59:33       It does threading and shows your community who you talk to online, uh, who you call on your cell phone. Supposedly that's what this thing is capable of. Uh, so it shows them all this information and they can cherry pick. Maybe they go through an email from three years ago where jokingly I said, you know, with a friend, uh, you know, yeah dude, fuck the u s you know, and they just quote that I think should this guy be running for Congress, you know, and like bring bogus charges against you. There's so many ways they can screw you over when they have access to all of your information. And so people out there go, they're not gonna, they're not watching me. And that's true. Nobody with a pair of headphones is listening to your every word on the cell phone. That's not how this is working. Instead, it's being archived and giving them tremendous access to screw you over should you become a problem to them. I think again, that's the power of the government. Shouldn't have,

Speaker 1:          01:00:20       I couldn't agree more. It's a, and the government shouldn't want it right now. I think the real issue is that we've developed an US versus them divide between the government of the people. And he shouldn't be that at all. You know, it shouldn't be them defending their power position. It should be. They are us and we, they are representatives are us and they're looking out for us legitimately right. And clearly that's been corrupted and that's not good for them. It's not good for the people that are perpetrating. This is not good for you either, man. You, you might be profiting off of it, but it's horrible for your life.

Speaker 6:          01:00:52       That's the only, that's the only ray of uh, really the only ray of light here is that this program is so vast and Orwellian to be honest, if what this whistleblower says, it's true, it's so vast that it's also our calving information on senators and representatives and FBI agents, people at the very top of government. And those people don't really want that, you know, they don't want, uh, for some agency that's basically unaccountable to be able to screw them over at any point in the future. So I think that's kind of the thing there that might save us in the end is that some powerful people in DC might say, wait a second, this is totally ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          01:01:28       Well, I know we said that at the end of this technology connection that we have, it's gonna, it's gonna rush upon us so quickly that you're not, you're not even gonna know what hit you. And then at a certain point in time, there will be no more privacy. It will won't exist.

Speaker 6:          01:01:43       That would be, that would be something that you can get used to. If it was two ways. Yes, I no longer have any privacy. This is the 21st century. The government knows and I'm walking around on the sidewalk and I better not be committing a crime against anybody else. Uh, but in exchange I want to see where our money's going. I want to see why we need to still be in Afghanistan. I want to see why you're funding a multibillion dollar storage facility in Utah, uh, which the NSA is going to be using to store all this data. Like I want to see the numbers. So then what's going on right now? Absolutely happening right now. It's not a plan. No. If you can you actually bring up the New York Times video. Sure. Uh, can you bring it up Brian? And so we

Speaker 4:          01:02:19       can see it on the scale. I'll try. It's called, uh, it's called the program. Um, so you're freaking me out by the way. Thanks. This is like the, the first, I was hoping, I was hoping this would a be a good opportunity to talk about this stuff. What's it called? Yeah, say it again. What's it called again? The article is called like the program. Just search for the program. William Binney New York Times. You just, you've described it better than any I've heard anybody describe it in the most honest and ominous way. Right. Well, like that, that's the thing about this is it's not, it's not that right now, by the way, the NSA supposedly employees, uh, they employ more people then the CIA and the FBI combined. So when people say they don't have the capacity to spy on you, actually they do. They have the funding and they have the employees to do it and no, like they really aren't listening in on your every word, like a Jason Bourne movie, what they're doing. There's the video

Speaker 8:          01:03:14       and this is in Bluff Dale, Utah. For folks that are looking at home, we're just looking at some frozen landscape and it says following nine 11 the national security agency, Mccann, a top secret surveillance program to spine US citizens without warrants, Codenames, stellar wind or the program to insiders. The full scope of the surveillance.

Speaker 9:          01:03:32       This has not been made public. It is raining Severen Maryland. There's a man who's doing heroin now. He needs glasses, king, different codes and uh, and data systems. And he's an NSA whistleblower doing data beneath those lips. The Soviet Union,

Speaker 8:          01:03:51       he worked at the NSA for 32 years. He is regarded as one of the best mathematicians and code breakers in the NSA's history. Yep.

Speaker 9:          01:03:58       They're nine 11 they took one of the programs I would have done or the backend part of it and started to use it to spy on everybody in this country. So and that that was a program they created called stellar wind. That was the separate and compartmented from the regular activity that was ongoing because it was doing domestic spying. All the equipment was coming out. I knew something was happening, but then when my, the contractors I had hired came and told me what without what they were doing, it was clear where all the hardware was going and what they were using it to do. It was simply a different input. Instead of being foreign, it was domestic employees.

Speaker 10:         01:04:42       Somebody told me to pick him, listen to what we're saying by my having us, even if it's turned off. Yes, here's the, here's the real grand design. Every domain, think of a domain as an activity, a specific type of activity, phone call or banking is another domain. So if you think of graphing each domain and then each graph, then turning it in. The third dimension. The trick now is to map through all the domains and that third dimension, pulling together all the attributes that any individual has in every so that now I can pull your entire life together from all those domains and map it out and show your entire life over time.

Speaker 8:          01:05:28       Jesus Christ, this is crazy. Should we address this whole thing? Oh, let's watch a little bit more, more frozen landscape. The NSA is currently building the country's biggest data storage facility in bluffed. Dalian.

Speaker 11:         01:05:41       Tom,

Speaker 9:          01:05:42       yeah. You got to watch the next two minutes cause he talks about when the FBI raided him.

Speaker 11:         01:05:46       So

Speaker 8:          01:05:47       Betty calculates the facility as a capacity to store 100 years worth of the world's electronic communication.

Speaker 10:         01:05:56       I don't understand why not. What should I do? Because what you're saying, if it was possible, it would be revolutionary and people would have invested interest in preventing that from happening. I'm too old. I'm too old.

Speaker 11:         01:06:10       Whoa.

Speaker 10:         01:06:12       I'm too old. That's a scary thing to say.

Speaker 10:         01:06:15       I'm not sure how many of you got a chance to hear Keith Alexander yesterday, the head of the NSA. I talk about the NSA's activities bill, how do you reconcile, is there some way to reconcile general Alexander statement to that the NSA is and keeping track of every American with the existence of a facility like the one in Utah, NSA charter and it was illegitimate. My one was to do foreign intelligence and I was with that all the way and I did the best I could in their job. Unfortunately they took those programs as I build and turned them on you. I'm sorry for that. I didn't intend that, but they did that to what you're describing really is a hard to reconcile with the laws as the laws are generally understood by the lawyers who work with them. Most people are familiar with the Webster's definition of intercept.

Speaker 10:         01:07:01       You said 18 has a different definition and that's uh, an intercept doesn't take place until it's actually listened to it until somebody puts on, on some earphones or actually read some text on a screen. So you can pull in all the communications you want. The acquisition isn't a search in the querying later on is a search and they can then keep it in their database and target after the fact by going back and conducting data mining searches afterwards. In other words, to get the information that they couldn't target from the outset and there is another real problem. Unfortunately the software will want to take some data. It will build profiles on everybody in that data.

Speaker 9:          01:07:42       Okay. Jesus Christ, you're like olive garden. The purposes to be able to monitor how they're going to know about me. Yeah. Sorry to bring the vibe down by recommending this video. By the way, this has been haunting my dreams like this is real. Yeah, but do you think most p look have to worry about this? Like carrying that? They do this about you hold on, hold on, turn style you the outline at the life of everybody in the community and if you carry it over time from 2001 up, you have that 10 years worth of their life that you could lay out in a timeline. Then involves anybody in the country, even senators and House of Representatives. All of them. The dangers here are that we fall into something like a totalitarian state like East Germany in July, 2007 the FBI raided the homes of many and two other NSA whistleblowers.

Speaker 9:          01:08:31       Well, they came in guns drawn, you know, in my house. They didn't do that to the others, but they did to me, I guess. I Dunno. They thought I was probably the most dangerous at all. So I don't know. I didn't know what was in their minds. Okay. So, but they did that and, and they came in and pointed the gun at me when I was getting out of the shower at the time. So they pointed a gun right in my old head, you know what I'm saying? Hey, so Jesus Christ, I wasn't too upset. I just said, uh, yeah, I suppose I can get it. I could get dressed here, tried to, they weren't intimidating me anyway. So Tommy, something that will, a intimidating, implicate somebody in a crime. That's what they asked me. So I told them what the crime was that I knew about and that was that, uh, George Bush and Dick Cheney tenant.

Speaker 9:          01:09:13       And Aiden conspired to subvert the constitution and constitutional process and any number of laws. And here's how they did it. And I explained stellar wind on my back porch to all the FBI agents who weren't cleared. So he had a problem. I created a problem for them because they had a bunch of people now who aren't cleared for a very highly classified only because it was domestic spying. By the way. What's the reason? It was highly classified. You know, they wanted to highly classify the extreme impeachable crimes, right? They were committed. Top Justice Department officials threatened to resign in 2004 because stellar wind violated the law. They're legal objections to the program or not. We should take turns. Democracy need to say, do you read, do we want our government to have this data or not? And if, if so, if we want them to have it, then what kind of controls and they have to be a little bit when we're invisible, it can't all be done in secret. It can't have secret interpretations of laws and run them at secret and not tell anybody or can't make up kill list. And not telling anybody what the criteria is for being in the kill is. Okay. It's raining again.

Speaker 6:          01:10:19       That's a very, very disturbing. That just really fucked my head sideways. Well, when I saw that my initial reaction was why isn't this on the homepage at the New York Times? Like they're putting their name behind this. This is real journalism. It just came out like last week. Uh, this should be everywhere. That's, that's the problem I have, by the way, with some of the mainstream media, you know, people have tweeted this video out to everybody, you know, it's gotten out in the media and for some reason like, oh, this isn't news, we're just going to run with Kim Kardashian was stumbling out of some nightclub. And by the way, they might be spying on every single person, but it's not important. Holy Shit. Uh, so, well this is not, they might be, it's, it seems like they are the only, the only credibility issue is it comes down to, do you believe William Binney and the other whistle blower, Thomas Drake. If, if this guy's full of Shit, then the whole story is called an the question, but the problem is he was a very high ranking. He was there for 32 years and they don't want psychos work at the NSA like they do some pretty serious psychological

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       background stuff. From what I understand. The other thing on top of that is this guy was a respected, brilliant mathematician. He's like a John Nash, you know, this isn't some like dumb dude had got caught up and some paranoia. It's more like, although I guess John Nash did exactly do that, but the point is he's a very smart guy who is working at a high level and despite how intelligent he is, he realized, wait a second, this is just profoundly wrong and it's not our mandate. It's not what we should be doing. And I'd love the fact that he explained it all to the cops as they arrested him. That's the other thing. The FBI agents are already pretty high up in terms of clearance level and the fact that that blew their minds and they're like, wait, what is this stellar wind program? That's scary stuff is scary stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:11:55       And the, the, the beautiful thing is when he does explain them, I mean if you listen to that guy talk, when he did explain it to them, I'm sure it made a lot of them questioned why they were arresting him. Right. And question whether or not he was in fact a patriot and not a bad guy. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:12:10       Like what we're buying. That's a red flag word. Why is it, why is this old man in the shower a threat to our security?

Speaker 2:          01:12:15       Yeah, it sounds ridiculous. I mean cause he's a super mathematician. What is he a fucking Batman comic book character. He's gonna fucking develops a mathematical formula to overthrow the world by hacking into your email account.

Speaker 4:          01:12:26       Come on. Yeah, that video. The video has been haunting my dreams though. That's the sand. It's been like, it's kind of a, it tells you about your friends. Like I've been emailing it to people and when I get an email back saying, holy shit, that's terrifying. Like good thing you're running for Congress. Ha Ha. And I'm like, I'm like, you're screwed. There are real stakes involved. Like, people don't get it. Like if you want to keep the same representatives you have now who were supportive of this stuff, good luck. Well the but uh, sorry to cut you off. Please do. Uh, sometimes, uh, you get an email back or somebody who's like, whatever dude. Like they just don't care. And I'm like, how far gone or you that you don't care about this. Yeah. Those people are silly.

Speaker 2:          01:13:04       I care about it, but I don't think I've, I do anything really insanely wrong where I'm fearing it. Know what I mean? Like I've, I mean, I don't think it's that big of a deal. It sucks. If it's true, I wish I would say no, don't do it. Right. But let me paint a scenario. Cared. Let me paint a scenario for you. Okay. Since you always date all these lovely ladies. All right. What if a one of your lovely ladies would come like you gotta to take a leak? Yeah. What if one of you lovely ladies had come in contact with a certain politician now at a very high ranking position and this guy just decided that he wanted a bang your wife, so he gets you locked up and put in jail and you have no recourse. And he pulls up some email where you said, you know, something crazy, you know, 10 years ago, joking and completely trolling it.

Speaker 2:          01:13:43       But because of the fact that he asked me, what has this written down into your name, that's it going to arrest you. I know. That's insane. It is. But it's something that they'd be able to do. Yeah, but that's the phrase, you know, I was watching CNN the other night, it's not that crazy. And this is why I was watching the CNN the other night and they had a guy who, um, is a cop who is a under questioning for two people's deaths and they think he might've been, uh, like a, a some time serial killer. And that this cop, uh, he, uh, there's two people disappeared. Any of the same story for both of them, that he dropped him off at the circle k and a, one of them was a, a Mexican guy who couldn't speak English and the other one was this, uh, this black guy and they think that, uh, this cop might've killed these people.

Speaker 2:          01:14:26       And why did he do it? Because he could because he could because he had the power is in that position. He had a gun pulled over the lights go on, he calls into thing, calls in the car and said that, uh, he, he had two totally different stories and one story he found the car abandoned. And in the other story he actually did a background check on the guy. So he actually called in a background check that like the, the whole thing is the guy turns out missing and he has like this cockamamie story about taking the guide to the circleK and calling the circle k and that, that record's not on his phone, you know, is an official phone. What I'm saying is that this guy was a cop. They just decided to kill people. Why? Because he had the power of you get some guys some high position of power, one of those little sweet pieces of ass that you carry around. Dude, you never know. You never know. Motherfucker might just turn on your boxes. You can't let someone, you cannot let someone have that kind of power. They, that there's no reason for it. There's plenty of recourse right now. Someone does something wrong. We don't need to like up the amount of power that the government has over it.

Speaker 3:          01:15:26       I guess I have way too big of a, I had a positive, not negative skew being delusional. I like being delusional with this shit like it. But you know what? I was in Ohio, which, uh, I forgot how bad the police state and Ohio was like everywhere you go, you saw cops on the, on an hour drive from Columbus to date. And I had seven p like cop car pulled on the side of the road with the guns pointing at your cars, you know, that still trappings seven. And then, uh, one night I was hanging out with Bert Kreischer, his shows. I did a spot and uh, uh, I had a couple of drinks, you know, at the show there's going to go to Mcdonald's and go to my hotel. So I go to Mcdonald's, go through the drive through, I'm going to park my car, you know, to eat it.

Speaker 3:          01:16:06       And that parking lot was too crowded for Mcdonald's, so there was like another parking lot attached to it. It was like a big boy that was a, it was close. So I just pull right through, you know, right out of there, the drive through right into it, you know, with my lights on, eating my mic riddle and suddenly two cop cars, both sides lights on like, and they're like off a third, what are you doing in your car? And I'm like, they're like shining lights on my face. And I'm like, ah, I'm eating a McGriddle, you know, like show it to 'em out the window. And uh, they came up to my car and there goes, uh, let me see your license. I showed him my license and it, and it was just like, holy shit man. Like now what? They're going to make me do like a drunk test and because I had three beers in the last two hours, like now I'm going to get a Dui because I'm sitting here eating and Mick griddle.

Speaker 3:          01:16:48       And then he's asking me all these questions like, what are you doing? I'm like, I did a comedy to it and I, uh, you know, the funny bone. And he goes, uh, uh, he's like, oh, how was it? And I'm like, it was fine. He goes, you've been drinking tonight. And I go, no, that was the first time I ever said no. Like I had three drinks, but I'm like, I'm just going to say no this time. Cause I had a griddle all over my face and I was still eating when he's actually asking me these, I played it off

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       like, what the fuck are you doing dude? Like I always like, you know, and so I'm rubbing Madrid all over my face and uh, uh, he goes, okay, you're free to go. And I'm like, free to go for doing what? I'm parking my car, eating a McGriddle came up. They always make you feel like you're in the wrong, but they let you get get away this time. You know, Ross, they're us. They're not the Illuminati. That's what's the most fucked up thing about you give people arbitrary power over other people. Exactly. That's why he can't have laws like that folks, state and police have the, we give you a nice things and you break them. You can't have that and it's not good for them either. It's not good for you to be in a position like that over. It's not good for your Karma.

Speaker 4:          01:17:48       At the end of the day, you're unhappy because I've found this like if you're, if you treat other people in a shitty way, and maybe for a short amount of time, you get that little ego high, but over time it's like you to pay for it comes back. Exactly. Waterfall of suck and it crushes you with the rebound and always does. It just is no way to live these people. And by the way, that's not the only way to get rich to look at Ted Turner. I bet that guy's got plenty of money. Right? They actually on CNN. Yeah. But he's like, no, no, no. He's out. I think he's out. I think he's disgusted with maybe that's why it's so fucked up. Yeah. Like he, he sold it to, I guess like a w like AOL Time Warner became this big thing. But anyway, I shouldn't use him as an example anyway because quite honestly, I don't really know that much about his past.

Speaker 4:          01:18:31       He always, but he always seemed like it wasn't a bad guy, just like a smart businessman. It didn't seem like a Richard Branson. He seems like an awesome guy. That's much better example. Thank you. Richard Branson seems like, like, like some kind of crazy billionaire and a movie. Like, I'm going to get an a balloon and travel the globe. I'm going to get a space ship going to Mars. I mean, he really does seem like that guy. So fucking super, super, super. Read his article about, uh, drug policy. No, I did incredible on the Virgin did if we're on the virgin corporate websites, so he puts his corporate name behind it, virgin.com. He, uh, put this letter saying, you know, we should all look at the Portugal decriminalization project the past 10 years. They're doing decriminalization. It works. Is this, about a year ago he did this, uh, maybe a little less than that around then.

Speaker 4:          01:19:18       Uh, when he did that, people were like, okay, we have to actually look at this study because he's a serious guy. A lot of people don't realize that Portugal decriminalized all drugs. Uh, it was it a decade ago, a decade ago, essentially made it so that everything is legal. And what, what's crazy is that they're violent. Crime has dropped, their rates of addiction have dropped. Um, clinics have less people in them that needed help, that are, that are addicted. So it's kind of amazing. It's when you let people, you know, you don't try to nanny state the fucking world. People have this weird thing where if you tell them they can't do something, they want to do it. They, it's weird. When something's illegal, it makes it an intoxicating and makes it exciting for people. You know, it's whereas as well, and there were also some things that are so good that even if they're illegal, you're going to try it anyway. Sure. You know, booze, they, they tried that.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       They tried, uh, you know, that was, that's another example of legislation where you have good intentions but nobody did the math on it. Yeah. And, and really not even good intentions because you can't tell people what to ingest and the privacy of their own home. I understand their point. I understand the point of the, the really clean, straight edge people. I have friends that are straight edge. Totally fine. I shouldn't have to impose it on the whole country. You're right, you're right. But what they think is that it worked for them and there's no way it could, uh, it could be different for you. You, in your case, if you're drinking, if you like to go out and do shots and hang out with Bert Kreischer, you are having a problem, you've got a problem. And you know, obviously I don't agree with that, but I see where their intention is coming from.

Speaker 1:          01:20:46       I see why they wanted to try to do it in the first place. They wanted to try to clean up America, America, even back then in the 1920s it's filled with sin. It was the roaring twenties everybody was fucking nuts. They were having these speakeasies they get together and bang. It was craziness. There were animals. It's pretty awesome actually. Fucking fantastic. No texting, you know. All you can have to say is, I don't know what she's talking about. And you were done. You were out of it. There was no good age though. Were they my kid? You agreed to meet somebody and you just met them. There is no like last minute changes and like, and how'd you meet him again? You have to find where they live and that's why cities are so beneficial. There was no communication. There's no phones. We had to find where they live or how do people get around before the maps on phones?

Speaker 1:          01:21:27       Well, I remember living in Boston and you know, meeting people and walking everywhere. I mean I remember when I was a kid from high school on like we fucking walked everywhere. We would walk like miles to the t to the, to the train to get into Boston. We just walk miles. Kids today don't do that kind of shit. There's no kids walking my, they're texting each other. They don't have to go and meet each other in person. They don't have to go and hope they run into each other. We didn't even have answering machines. You call people if they weren't home. Tough Shit. It's been a weird thing for me as a human being to have come of age should be a teenager and with the, with the invention of the answering machine and seeing that and going, wow, you mean so we can fucking leave a message and you're not even here.

Speaker 1:          01:22:12       Like what a mind blower that was for me to sing this video. Yeah. Of what kind of information is being and how much they can know about every credit card transaction. I think that's the, the other, uh, the other thing about, you're saying earlier about like where things really, uh, maybe things were just as bad back then, but we didn't know about it because we didn't have the Internet. I think part of it is they would have, maybe they wanted this kind of thing, but they just didn't have the technology to do it to pull it off. It would just be it be possible to do this thing would require like hiring millions of operators and you just, you can't do that. But it's an example of the ethic that's always been there. It's the US versus them mentality that is accelerating because of the fact there's so much civil uprising around the world.

Speaker 1:          01:22:55       I mean we really are getting to this really ridiculous point where, you know, the Mayan apocalypse date of 2012 December 21st date, it's completely ridiculous that these guys had figured out when the world was going to fall apart. Yet. How weird is it that the world is fucking falling apart? It's closing in on that day. How many earthquakes? We had a yesterday, it's hundreds of earthquakes. There was one area that at hundreds of earthquakes I think we actually have, like, I think the US has a really bright future, but I think, uh, it's kind of all a house of cards. Like you have to be very careful. You start pulling out certain cards and undermining faith in certain things and before you know it, you don't have a society anymore. You have, you know, with the Mayans experienced to their society vantage or broke down or whatever the hell happened to them.

Speaker 1:          01:23:40       Yeah. It's not just that these people shouldn't be corrupt. It's that when you are corrupt and when you are in a position where you are not looking out for the greater good of mankind, you're ruining the entire process of acceleration. You're ruining it and subverting it and making it a selfish thing and making all the, all the things that don't get corrected as we move forward. It's like say if you were a little kid and you just decided you were going to shit in the middle of your bedroom because you didn't feel like going to the bathroom, you have your own choice. Nobody can tell you what to do. So you just say you're five, you're like, I'm just going to shit right here. You pull your pants down and shit and then you make a little pile and your bathroom and then you always think you're going to clean up, but you never get around to it.

Speaker 1:          01:24:20       I mean, that's essentially what the human races to the world, which is leaving shit places and just assuming we're eventually gonna get to some point, we're going to clean it up instead of dealing with it first and foremost, before we start fucking around with the governments and other parts of the world, and before we start fucking around with tap at People's phones, let's figure out a way how to get oil out of the fucking ocean without killing everything. Let's figure out a way to let the dolphins live and not have shrimp be fucking poison. Let's figure out a way to not putting a tire economy out of work because you fucking assholes wanting to finish your drill early so you've used cheaper parts are less stringent. Set up. Amen. Get on that first and then let's fade Iran. That's the other thing that outrages me so much.

Speaker 1:          01:25:08       You see a video like that and he's, and it's not only like, okay, they're violating our rights. And there are creepy implications for how this can be used at some point, but it's, this is a colossal waste of money. This is billions and billions of dollars and this is only one program that we know about it. We don't know what other creepy programs are out there right now. And uh, how that same amount of money could be used on things where you see a real tangible impact on people's communities. Like teachers don't get paid. Well, cops don't get paid well. No. Uh, and maybe if we paid people better and have better incentives, we would get better people. That's how it is in every other industry and it should be an honorable position. I've always said that being a teacher should be a position of respect and honoring this country. And it should be something that's very difficult to achieve. We should know that you are of of great character, that you're a good person, that you're looking at life in the right direction, you know, a creepy pervert. We should know all these things about you and when we should respect the fact that you're going to be spending time with our kids. And some of that spending time with your kids has profound influence. They're teaching them things.

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       Yeah, it's really dangerous. You can't even put a money. Uh, you can't even put a price on the impact. You can have either good or bad. I had a civics teacher in seventh grade. He's part of the reason why I'm interested in politics today because, uh, he did this crazy experiment that I feel like every teacher should do. We were in a private school at the time, so you're allowed to get away with more stuff. And a public school prior would have been sued. Uh, but what he did, we walked into class one day. It just seemed like a normal class, right? And, uh, we walk into class and he says, okay, uh, if you have brown eyes, you have brown eyes sit in the front two rows. If you have a, you have blue eyes, I want you in the back of the room.

Speaker 4:          01:26:41       And he just segregated us by Eichler. And, uh, at first people were like, okay, this is some kind of joke, you know, he's just messing around and you'd say you and call on someone with Brown eyes and give them preferential treatment over the blue eyes. I think I'm actually messing this up. I think it was the other way around. Like it people who have blue eyes doses. Yeah, exactly. If you looked area and uh, you were in the, you are in the front and if you didn't you were in the back. And uh, so he starts asking questions and whenever somebody in the back was asked a question answered, he said, no, that's wrong. You obviously didn't do the homework last night. You have to read up. This is, even if it was a great answer and it was starting to fuck with people mentally where these people were getting better treatment and the people in the back based entirely on Eichler.

Speaker 4:          01:27:23       By the end of that class there were girls crying and, and guys too, like people were crying and like, what's up? And they were like, is this real? Like what's wrong with this guy? Why is it doing this? It's my answer was good and then at the end then at the end he told us he was just running an exercise to show us what it's like when you have inequality and for somebody using a suburban white kid, you're like, that must suck. To feel that all the time. You know, it's a deep experiment. I think every teacher should do that, and that wasn't the only thing he did, but the point is he had a profound impact and he probably made a very small amount of money for doing it. That's a beautiful idea, man. That's a beautiful way of pointing it out. Show it, show it to people and let them know that it was just an act, but show, show them what is possible.

Speaker 4:          01:28:04       You know, there's, look, there's a lot of racism in this country that's undeniable and it's one of the grossest things about human beings, but classism, all that shit is just as bad. Any, any, any distinction where you automatically put someone in a desert where you'll put your prejudging marginalized. I've met some rich people who suck and I met some really rich people who are just amazing. Absolutely you don't. You don't judge somebody by their income. I've always been offended that people think you're an idiot because you exercise and perhaps someone who fucking stupid conversations with people that are like, Oh, good work in your body. Meet Hood. I'm like, go stay in shape and why is that marginalize me because I'm in shape half everybody that lifts weights has to be a more on really is that convenient for you? You don't have to compete. Certainly not good for evolution. It's so ridiculous. People are just slowly trying to stop what is inevitable. They're clawing at what is inevitable and what's inevitable. It's ultimate accountability for everything, all of your actions, and then it's eventually going to move from that to being your very

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       thoughts. There's going to be the next phase of technology unquestionably is going to be some sort of fucking interface where people are going to be able to read each other's minds or communicate without any sort of noise coming out of your mouth. I think that is 100% common. I think we're going to be able to communicate things in visual form as well. I think you're gonna be able to communicate memories eventually. You're going to be able to lock heads with someone and show them your day and I don't think that's out. And I think your memory is going to be more phenomenal than the current fucking weird slide show that you have now. Blurry images that you barely can remember. It just what I did today. If you asked me how I what? What exactly happened from the moment you woke up? Can you remember every no, no I don't. I remember playing with my kids. I remember getting in my car, this is blocks, little little flashes, a little slideshow. You'll be able to pull all of that shit. You'll be able to pull every second

Speaker 3:          01:29:57       software. It's going to make it probably Google goggles, bitch. No, no, that software. We just watched that video on the New York Times. It's probably going to be like, you want to see my day? Here's an exact DVR of my day, but I edited out like two hours of poop of me. Boop beating off on the toilet with two Q tips. That's the ultimate sin beating off on the toilet while you're have a qtip in your air and shit. So bad for you man. Taking a shit rubbish. Q-Tips. Yeah, they're terrible for you man. You need to just get it done. Once I had loved my, no, no, no, I do. I just, I need to wait. Qtip it's bad. Some times you shouldn't be digging in your ears. What are you supposed to do that and cause your wax builds up. He's supposed to get it cleaned, cleaned out or they have like, like ear juice that you can buy it.

Speaker 3:          01:30:39       It's like cvs, he put it in there has like this little plunger thing, but you're the worst thing you're not supposed to do. That's where nowhere on the box for a box of Q tips is it say put this shit in your ear. Right? It's crazy. So good though. It does. Especially when you're taking a shit and beating off. I told you, I told you this Joe with my, I don't know if I told her on podcasts of my, this is my ex, she was cleaning her ear out and then uh, she, the phone rang so she picked it up and she shoved the qtip inner ears start gushing blood and pocket your drunk. Yeah. You did talk about this on the podcast. So watch this power, find ways to die. The one where the uh, she's getting a massage or no, she's getting acupuncture and like rolls off the bed and like one goes right through her heart is how real.

Speaker 3:          01:31:21       I mean it has to be real. It's a thousand ways to die. What are they doing? Shish Kebab needles on this bitch. That doesn't even make sense. How the fucking you get killed by an acupuncturist scene of a pussy. Are you that an acupuncture needle is killing you? Just went right through a heart. I guess. I almost think that shows like creep show though. Like I almost think that it's like written. Um, but I think, I think they have to be factual Brazil thing. It's based on I think. I think it's supposed to be here. I like, I like, I almost think that's one of those shows that they write stories like that. Yeah, you could die. Why wouldn't they have that as an option? I mean they'd be crazy if the producers didn't have that as an option. Yeah, maybe you're right. Yeah. The act

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       of bumps or one doesn't make any sense to me. That sounds crazy. If it's on true TV, it has to be fake. It's fucking completely ridiculous. I don't think the acupuncture needles could kill you like that cause it went right through our heart so it could have just, how's it going? Right through your heart. It's going to penetrate all that meat. It's going to go through your bone. What's it going to do is you got to find the perfect, yeah. Really. Maybe she had to bat Boone hard. Maybe it's being, maybe. Maybe if it fucking you landed on it perfectly and it didn't bend maybe, but really I wouldn't think that thing would kill you. I wouldn't be too little. Can I take an Alpha brand and see if the next like ours. I'm just curious like if I become really smart all of a sudden go for dose. Well, you're already super smart dude. And you already saw articulate. You're barely going to notice here to smarter. Ready. What this is for is mid level retards like myself that can barely form sentences without it. Oh actually take, did you just chew it?

Speaker 12:         01:32:49       Oh, I was like, you're a fucking savage. Imagine he just started snorting it. Is this your Alpha brain? Yeah. David Seaman running for Congress. I caught starting drugs and the Joe Rogan experience podcast. They know it's a new tropic. It doesn't count. Are you trying to, is this a pee Dee for politics? Should it be allowed next on Nightline?

Speaker 1:          01:33:13       Shit. Nootropics be allowed. Should we allow people to be smarter than others when they could use it against you? They'll have some like youtube video of this 16 year old like artist took a nootropic and like

Speaker 12:         01:33:24       I'm going to folks a butcher

Speaker 1:          01:33:27       then it was Salvia. They totally villainize Salvia, right? Cause they're like, we found a couple of dudes on youtube, millions of people have tried it and it's legal in a lot of states. We found some dudes on Youtube who acted like assholes when after they took it. Brian's one of them. So clearly that's scientific. Clearly based on what a couple of people post on youtube, we have to make this illegal and we have to do a witch hunt against it. It's fascinating that it was legal for so long and such a potent psychedelic, and it's, it's, I think it's very indicative of the times we live in. It's, people slowly figured that out and started to sell it, you know, because what you mean, that wasn't around, what is it exactly? It's, it's sage is what it is. The word, the plants. Sage is this sub Salvia divinorum target.

Speaker 1:          01:34:08       So it's just like, it's like I want to target the plant form of it. Um, well they also sell San Pedro cactuses. You could buy those anywhere. They're not illegal. And that's the source of masculine. That's the really the Carlos Castaneda stuff. Well, Terrence, we can, uh, famously, uh, on the big island of Hawaii had a tropical rain forest garden. He lived on, uh, the rain forest side where it was beautiful up there. Man, there's pictures of his home was incredible. He had this really cool pad he put up there on the island and he had every psychedelic plant known demand because most of them grow breasts in these, uh, these sort of a rain forest environment. So breast, yes. So you had it set up there. We had Salvia, he had San Pedro cactus. They're all legal. The, the, the, the plant, what it, whatever it is, the uh, Chicago Tree Veritas that they get Iowasca from all these different plants.

Speaker 1:          01:34:59       He had them all growing. They're all totally legal and beautiful and fascinating to know that all of these different plants, I mean, even if you just had them as your little plant buddies, you never even smoked him, just kept them in your yard. There's something kind of dope knowing that you could literally change your consciousness or some shit that's growing next to your house, knowing that has that kind of power. Incredible power. And Salvia is way more potent than a lot of shit that is illegal. It's, it's way more posed. Salvia is really fucking strong. If you, you get a real good dose of Salvia. It is, it removes you from Earth for a short period of time. It puts you in this really intense hallucinogenic state. Can I, can I admit that I've done Salvia? I don't think that hurts me. I don't think it hurts.

Speaker 1:          01:35:38       Ya know, I did an estate where it was legal and yeah, so short acting, it's like five minutes and I collapsed and I felt I was actually a sheet of paper, like a cosmic sheet of paper. Yeah. It's weird stuff. It's like a whippet of mushrooms. It's like doing like a, it's so fast. I couldn't find five minutes later I was back to myself. And it's not like you're stuck there for hours, you know? I only did it once and it didn't, I don't think I did it right, but I did it enough that it was really creepy. Like on a podcast show. Yeah. I don't think that's a good, that's not something you would ever get addicted to cause I was like, all right, cool. Did that, like it took me over my own head and I was looking down at myself and like these pulsating waves, uh, to get like a new burst and new image of me looking from like over here, like up and to my right looking down at me and I'm like, Ooh, we like the Indian gods with all the different hands.

Speaker 1:          01:36:31       No, it was just me. It was just me. I don't think I had enough, like I said, and it didn't last that long. It was just a few minutes of an out of body experience. But I was, I remember thinking like, how am I even seeing this perspective? How am I seeing myself from here? Like this is weird. How am I seeing it? Or Am I getting a hallucination of the idea that I'm saying? And he didn't know. How crazy is it that you can just walk into a store and buy it legally? But my experience, I was still me. I was still there. I didn't, you know, I didn't leave the couch. I've had people that have taken a lot of it describe like really bizarre Ari Shaffir talks about how he lived a whole like several month period of his life during a a 10 minute Salvia trip while took it and then had all these relationships and friendships and had all this, this whole different life like inception, like the different layers where the time gets messed up.

Speaker 1:          01:37:22       Exactly. And he said when he came back from this 10 minute, you know, trip, the Salvia trip, he had remembered everything but it was just like, he was just like coming out of a month of a, you know, visiting your friends. It's a month of like all of a sudden you're here. How'd I get here? That's so weird. I really want to hear him talk that, talk about that because that does not sound like a Salvia trip at all. I know it doesn't, but I don't think they're all uniform. I, I've heard so many, like I said, mine was so simple. I didn't, I definitely didn't have enough cause it was just me. It was me above me. It was weird images of me looking down on me. It was nothing.

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       I didn't learn shit from it other than like, this is weird, but everybody that I know that's had like big ones I've taken like big, big experiences. I know I didn't get a big enough hit, but I could imagine if it could do that with like the little baby hit that I had where I wasn't even doing it. Right. Apparently you need like one of those blow torch library collider. Yeah. You need a blow torch lighter. I had like a big, and it just wasn't hot enough so it just kind of tripped me out a little bit. But apparently the blow torch light or puts you into another fucking dimension. Yeah, it has to cook it to a certain temperature in order to work stronger than weed. That's way stronger than we can just bond that you can just walk into a gift shop and buy it.

Speaker 4:          01:38:30       It's so stupid. We need to, and it's like that's actually dangerous. Like, yeah. And the sense that you could be an idiot who walks in the gift shop buys or $15. You pop it right there. You're, you smoke it right there. Although you can actually, I think get it as a tea or something. You can, I think so. Oh my God. Uh, so I, I didn't do it as a tea though. I, I smoked it, but uh, that the shit out of me is that the idea that you can not like the idea that you can get that legally and I just walk out in the street, you'll be just run over by a car. Cars are going to be so out of it versus, I mean, especially the t because who knows how your body is going to process it. What else was going to process it differently because it's going through the liver and the digestive system as opposed to just going right into the bloodstream with a smoke.

Speaker 3:          01:39:13       Now this isn't, yeah, this isn't, if somebody sent, this is a video of you doing it,

Speaker 13:         01:39:19       it's actually a campaign videos. This is David Seaman Rolling. Salvia real conservative with his hippie girlfriend. Well, I bet her feet steak. Why do you want to guess?

Speaker 7:          01:39:33       I would not doubt that you ever see this tour? Yeah. Oh yeah. I seen the shit. That's crazy. When I broke the window,

Speaker 13:         01:39:51       it's crazy. It's almost no real dude. He was almost like a Zombie,

Speaker 4:          01:39:54       like it's not real. I know. Almost like a Zombie. It's fake. It's fake. That's fake. Going to say that it's an anti Salvia as it, yeah. Okay. That seems a little over the top because I remember the ones that people just laughing and like screaming and stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:40:06       That's why I actually made a Salvia video. Not because, I mean I was like this is right before everyone started doing it, but like there was a few people doing this cool before. It was cool now, but there was few people that did salvia videos and it was the funniest videos to watch. Like I was laughing, like I was addicted. It was like dubstep from five years ago and then I just wanted to try it and then I wanted to make a video of it because it was fun watching yourself do it. But now I feel like an asshole for doing it because now every week kids doing it. And why do you feel like an asshole? Because I don't think that should be legal. Why not? Because I think like like that, that fun video that we just watched that could happen or somebody could do it while driving or or something like that. I can't protect the world from idiots Brian, because then it keeps stuff from you and I. Right. But at least think it should have some kind of 21 year old rating least or something. Some

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       maybe. You know what I mean? But I don't think it's rental supervision after 18 years of age, something like that. Yeah. To me that just seems too dangerous. Just because I, I didn't, I didn't know where I was for seven minutes at the very least. Like there should be an info packet on the back. Like the same way as you, you take a stupid drug for like allergies, there's a packet. It's like five pages long and telling you all the possible reactions and what to do. Right. Why don't to have the same thing for that

Speaker 2:          01:41:19       and listen, this is nothing. It's not, this is not like saying that it's a good idea for everybody to do these things because it's not, I know a lot of people that can barely handle regular reality and they should not be fucking with Salvia or anything. So to say that everything should be illegal, people should also have people looking out for them. People should also have people that they can turn to to be educated on your own choices. But I know people that take mushrooms for a goof, they just take it for fun. And guess what? There's nothing wrong with that. But I think we should have, if we're going to, if we're going to be an honest society about, about substances and their effect on people, we've gotta be honest about the positive stuff too. You've got to be honest, not just in people jumping out a window, which is possible, but you've got to also be honest about people who go on mushroom chips and become much better people.

Speaker 2:          01:42:08       Right? And that's like a real legitimate phenomenon that's been documented in the John Hopkins study that people have changed their personality for the better because at one intense mushroom trip that they had where they experienced profound love and connectivity and all things that people like me and my friends that have had psychedelic experiences is all relayed. Everybody realized the same thing. It changes who you are, changes the fundamental direction in which your life is going. And if we as a culture don't recognize it, that is a potential tool to help all of us, including the people that are in extreme positions of power. They would have a better life if they embrace this shit as well. And it's, it's, well, you can rule on,

Speaker 4:          01:42:45       on a deeper level if, yeah, if you had an experience like that, you can be more like a Marcus. It really is like enlightened despot instead of just the desperate, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:42:53       Absolutely. Uh, and really be looking out for the totally looking after the interests of the people. And there's reward in that. You only need a certain amount of money. You corrupt countries, you don't get it. You're caught up in a wave of addiction and that addiction is to numbers because after a certain while money doesn't mean anything. You forget it. It is nice to have a nice car. It is really nice to live in a place where you can come home and you have a nice couch to sit in and a nice TV to watch and a nice kitchen to cook your food and a nice bed to sleep in. But after that, everything else is horseshit. Everything else you forget every be it's, it's everything else is like, what do you want a bigger watch. One

Speaker 4:          01:43:30       look at more expensive. Should the houses, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, I wouldn't even want a house that big people. It just seems creepy. You need all that space to yourself. They have these giant estates that are 30,000 square feet. I'd be, I'd be embarrassed. I'd be embarrassed to bring somebody back to that. Yeah, this is my house because they'd be like,

Speaker 6:          01:43:51       that's mentally ill. Like why do you need this much space? You're like a hoarder, but for houses,

Speaker 2:          01:43:57       30,000 square feet behind wanting to how such a big house to represent you. It's like Evander Holyfield when he was the heavyweight champion, built this enormous mansion in Atlanta and he couldn't keep it up. He wound up, I don't know if you want to be losing it or what, but I remember he was, he was in severe financial straits because it was over $1 million a year just to run this place just to run it. $1 million a year.

Speaker 6:          01:44:24       Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:44:25       Keep your fucking lights on. Did she? The the the electricity working and it's craziness. People that are in that sort of a job, if you're in the job of being like Goldman Sachs sort of a guy and you have a house like that, it should be evidence of a sickness. Someone should come along and go, wait, why do you have Picasso's in your house? Right? Why do you have on this shit? What are you doing with all this shit? You just, you're obsessed with acquiring more and bigger shit. You want a bigger private jet, you want it. And that would be fine if it wasn't for you being in the position that you're in. You being in a position where you get to manipulate the fuck and market and literally changed the economy with your corruption and then get rewarded with a taxpayer bailout. Like we've never lived in more transparent times of, of the people at the top of the heap being sick. The people at the top of the heap all need to get into a fucking sweat lodge with some native Indians high. Yeah. And they pass around the Mescalin.

Speaker 6:          01:45:22       Well, it's also like, uh, the role of that person has changed now he's isolated in his huge 30,000 square foot mansion. I'm away from normal people. I think just the generation ago. I mean, I'm only basing this on some stuff I've read and mad men, which is not accurate at all. But I mean, just basing it on what I've heard from my parents and what I've read about. If you're the CEO of a company, uh, you also felt like you had some kind of role within the community. You didn't want to be known as a scumbag or like, Hey, uh, whoever the Enron guy was, that wasn't the end goal was to con thousands of people out of their retirements. You're supposed to be this kind of innovator that people respected and yeah, you made more money, Iacocca sorta exactly like you were making more money then because you're actually doing more and making it happen.

Speaker 6:          01:46:02       But at the end of the day, you didn't want to just conned everybody then live hundreds of miles away from them. You know, you wanted to be a part of the society. Cons. Yeah. Yeah. There's, there's no reason for them to be making that kind of money doing what they're doing anyway. It doesn't make any sense. You're not providing anything real. You're moving numbers around you crazy assholes. Why? Why are so many of them going to you? Can I play devil's advocate on that one too? Cause I have some friends who work in finance. And although I agree with you, that's, it seems like it's not the best use of our resources, especially when you have the absolute smartest people out of college getting recruited these firms instead of going to NASA or going into medicine or any of these other fields. Money. Yeah. Yeah. But to play devil's advocate a few hundred years ago, uh, we explored the whole world and did a lot of, a lot of crazy stuff over spices and spices to take it for granted.

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       You know, you walk over to target and buy some spices, but back then they would conquer people. They would build ships, they would chart out the whole globe with these sophisticated maps stuff that had never been done before. All about bringing spices back. And maybe today like, yeah, it's bullshit that these guys on computers are fighting each other for imaginary money. But maybe at the end of the day, it's also improving our technology in ways that we haven't anticipated. Uh, like I read an article about that, that, uh, trading now is so, so high frequency. If they have companies that build private radio networks just to get the trade out there like a 10th of a second faster. Wow. The whole companies, like there's a, there's a stock exchange in Chicago, the Mercantile Exchange and it has to communicate with the New York Stock Exchange and a, there are private companies that will feed that data back and forth over a private microwave network. It's a series of relays, the direct line of microwave or whatever. And the benefit it provides them as literally it's in the milliseconds. But that difference when you're dealing with, you know, thousands of trades and billions of dollars, it ends up being profitable to do that stuff. That's amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:47:55       Yeah. And I, I definitely could see that point, but my point is that we should never have a society that's based on the confidence in different options and stocks and companies. It's based on confidence and it flows and wait, all that shit is scary. All the derivatives fine, all that shit is terrifying. I W I read a Matt Taibbi article on the, the uh, the actual derivative economy being something like 10 times larger than the, the, you know, the speculative economy is 10 times larger than the actual account.

Speaker 6:          01:48:24       When we get enough bad bets, everything goes down.

Speaker 2:          01:48:27       It's nuts. It's crazy and it's not necessary. It is a symptom of a corrupt time and we need to abandon it. It's nonsense. This whole Federal Reserve thing is nuts. All that shit is nuts. We need to figure out some in some way where we can trade resources in a fair way. We need to figure that out and we're not going to figure that out while these monsters have a death grip on the economy because that's what we're running into. These big banks are a hundred times more oppressive than the big government. And then we see what the big governments doing. Well, the big banks, they just, it just clawing and suck in and biting your neck. They just trying to suck all the blood out of you. They can, you know, and they're terrified if any sort of rebellion. That's why Bank of America retracted their $5 ATM fee.

Speaker 6:          01:49:12       Oh, that was, I wrote some articles about that stuff and that was interesting because that got people mobilize pissed and then it's like, what about the, you know, $700 if you're working couple, it's something like $700 a month of the money you pay in taxes is going to like war effort and all that stuff. It's like, why aren't you protesting about these things? Is it, is it something where like if it doesn't immediately affect your purchase at Starbucks, you're not willing to talk about it. But like if you can see it so tangibly that you're like, fuck, there's $5 less than my account, then you go out and you're like, no, we're switching to a credit union. But the other stuff doesn't you, you know it's pretty Primerica.

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       Just go picks it takes her. I was only kidding. Totally joking. Don't meet it. That was, that was creepy though. Like they were, they were, they held firm for a little while. Then this is our policy. If you want to leave, that's fine. This is their policy. And they realize like this is a serious issue. And around the same time this is under reported, their website was inaccessible for almost a whole week. Whoa. And a, is that a d d o s a? No, they never said it was a denial of service and nobody ever took her up responsibility for it. You would think of somebody took down bank of America, they'd say, Yo, we did this right. But what actually happened is it just was not working. And Bank of America said we're having service issues and it was never properly, uh, no journalists properly looked into this.

Speaker 4:          01:50:30       I don't know what the cause was, but I know it did not appear to be a, a, an attack of any kind. It appeared to be a technical problem. And there are some people who wondered, is Bank of America trying to slow what is basically run on the bag? Cause there are a lot of people who saw the articles about the $5 debit card thing and like, fuck this, I'm just gonna move my money out and go to another bank. And they were trying to do it on the right. Nowadays a bank run doesn't look like what you see in the movies. It's not people running to a bank branch and demanding their money. It's people log on to their bank account, click, you know, out of Bank of America into my chase account. Boom. Enough people did that. The bank is no longer a solvent.

Speaker 4:          01:51:03       So some people wondered if they were trying to slow that outflow until they could figure out a policy like do we need to say we're not going to charge the $5 fee or you know, and then to go conspiracy on you. One dude even said that they're preparing, they're testing it out to see how, how would we stop and actual bank run and modern times and the best way to do it, we just shut down your mobile banking access, shut down your website access or slow it to the point where it's difficult to do stuff and you, you don't have as many people taking out money. Oh my God, that should be illegal. It should be. It was never properly looked into that. Like I said, is there any policy in regards to that? I don't know. Like if they claim they're having service issues, I don't know how much of a role of government has, he can't check on that. That seems like it was definitely about that. It's a weird coincidence of the timing. That's what bothered me. Like it's one thing if a bank has an outage because that does happen, but the timing was so perfect. It's like if I were a big bank and a lot of people are just, uh, if I were just being hemorrhaged right now, all these people withdrawing, maybe I would turn off my website

Speaker 1:          01:52:01       and shouldn't that be all over CNN? Shouldn't that be all over Fox News? Customers demand answers and rightly so. Right. And rightly so. I think a western union is looking better every day or whatever that she had a hole in my back yard just throwing money, check cashing places. The whole idea money is fucking terrifying ones and Zeros and fucking decimal points. What is, you're like,

Speaker 4:          01:52:26       uh, I liked the thing about gold. How, like when somebody hands you a gold coin, not that I've never actually made that much money where if somebody hands me a gold coin, but uh, when you look at one in a store and they hand it to you, it has weight, right? And you know that like it's possible this thing has thousands of years old and has no rust on it. And regardless of like what that thing is in terms of dollars,

Speaker 6:          01:52:46       you know that what you have is valuable. And it same thing like jewelry is made out of gold and silver and it's just something like in our, in our, uh, like little primitive brains, we know like shiny metal that's heavy and doesn't rust, has value. We can turn it into a million different things. This is money, you know? Uh, and then dollars seem like more and more ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          01:53:05       Do you know the ultimate ridiculous theory on why gold is valuable? What the Zacharias Hitchin theory? I'm not knowing that Ho, here we go down a crazy road. The ancient Sumerian text is like this cuneiform text that was written on clay tablets and it's just really odd. Ancient language from about 6,000 years ago were, it looks like you ever seen like an old school nail, like a nail on a really old building. You don't have a purpose. It's like triangular almost. Yeah, exactly. It's not like a tabletop of the spike. It's not like that. They're, they're more of like, like a, like a steak look and sort of a thing. Cause they were mined out of, uh, you know, they were, they were iron, they were made out of iron, these fucking things. Uh, she just, what was my point is Zachariah Zachariah sit to the cuneiform so that, anyway, this is this weird series of lines and it's all subject to interpretations.

Speaker 2:          01:53:57       It's really difficult stuff to, to decipher. But this one guy, Zacharias hitching, who's a legitimate biblical scholar and ancient linguist, he said that the entire thing was about the undue knocky and that the [inaudible] were an alien race that created us like the engineer in the the movie Prometheans like this was the, this idea of the Annunaki. There were these giants that created us by mixing their DNA with primate DNA. Okay. And that all of this was so that they could make us work for them and mine gold because they needed gold particles to suspend in their atmosphere to protect them from the radiation of sounds totally retarded that that's the answer I'm going to give. When somebody asks me what my religious beliefs, I'm going to say, here's what's crazy. This guy wrote this shit in like the 1970s and he's a legit scholar so it's really difficult to argue with them.

Speaker 2:          01:54:51       Although many other legit scholars do argue with them and completely disagree with his, with his translations of it. But what his translation that what got really weird was he wrote this in like 1970 and the two thousands, 2005 or six or something like that, they were, they had some sort of a scientific symposium when they're trying to figure out what are there other alternative methods of protecting people from radiation if we lose, uh, the, uh, the, uh, are part of our atmosphere, like ozone layers and stuff like that. And they came up with suspending reflective particles in the atmosphere. So these people back then had no idea that 1970, they had no idea that, well, this Zacharias hitching guys certainly was no scientists in regards to, you know, how to deflect radiation. That wasn't his area of expertise. So him coming up with this as a translation from a 6,000 year old text that was written on clay tablets, right?

Speaker 2:          01:55:38       It's quite remarkable that they mean he sang something that scientists figured 30, 40 years later. And what he's saying is that reflective particles suspended in the atmosphere can protect you from radiation, right? Well, the thing about gold is gold is unlike any other metal. And this is not something that you would need back in the day when you were fucking hurting. And you know, you had a need, a good metal that you can make a sword out and we can kill people. Gold wasn't useful in that way, but what it is useful and you could take gold dust and the small piece of gold can make an incredible amount of this ultra fine dust. And if gold has a bizarre, almost magical properties where you can take one piece of golden coat and incredibly wide surface with the most, uh, towards ductile, it's the most ductile metal there is.

Speaker 2:          01:56:23       You can bang it out into this thin little flake. Yeah, it's an amazing metal. It's a really bizarre and amazing mental and that it would be the perfect mental for suspending in our atmosphere to protect us from radiation. And that Earth has, uh, you know, a, a whole area where there's a lot of gold. So these aliens came down here realize that this is a good place for them to get some gold out of how do you do it? I don't want to let's make some people well, okay, that's, it makes me, she grabbed some monkeys, the through some DNA in him. It's completely ridiculous.

Speaker 4:          01:56:54       Cowboy to add. But it's not to add credibility to your theory. Okay. A cowboys and aliens. Yes. You seen that? Sure. There are there to harvest gold. Yeah. You know? Yeah. I don't think that helps us. I'm being sarcastic about being sarcastic about was looking forward to it

Speaker 2:          01:57:11       movie so bad. But the idea was that that's why we still have this thing for gold that we were literally put on earth to mine for gold. So we still think it's nice connection with value. Wow. And then we've lost completely lost all of our memories of the Annunaki cause this is thousands upon thousands.

Speaker 4:          01:57:28       What if it's less sinister than that? And it's like they came to earth and they're like, look guys, we need gold for our project and the atmosphere thing. So you give us gold and we'll give you stuff that you need and then you have people suddenly realizing, okay, Gold's money, you know? Oh yeah. It could be that. What's, what's interesting about, I don't like the idea of being an engineered by like biologically engineered slave.

Speaker 2:          01:57:51       What would the, the reason why I lean towards that and not, not 100% I mean, I don't agree with it or disagree with it, but I don't reject it as an idea simply because of the fact that the only thing that's like us, his dogs, the only thing that's like us that can vary so widely by the way it looks is humans. We're the only thing that [inaudible] like a dog dogs. Very incredibly man. You can have Max. Wow, us. Yeah, because they were like, we there were designed, right. We made them, they vary because of human intervention and I mean maybe it's a, what came first? The chicken or the egg, maybe human innovation came and then people varied drastically or when they were fucking created, they made a bunch of different versions of them. They tried a little bit of this. They went with like Asians probably have little more alien in

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       them just to touch just a smidge. I'm Italian. I probably have a little more monkey, you know, they probably, and by the way, this is not racist to alien to agents because it's better, I think probably to be more evolved, it's better to have little less monkey. So it's actually racist against myself. So I don't want any fucking Twitter beef over this, but it's ridiculous. Look, it's written. It's totally, completely ridiculous. It's, I don't know, and I don't believe in it, but I propose it. Who the fuck knows? Man? We're, we're starting to learn all sorts of crazy shit about our past. We're starting to learn about ancient civilizations in it at a time where we did not think that people were capable of building anything. And if they have these giant stone structures in South America back. No sense. Timeline wise, that's another thing.

Speaker 1:          01:59:22       Like, I remember going through school and you read the textbooks about Columbus and all this basic shit. Not once those textbooks are, they mentioned, oh, by the way, there's some random cities in South America. Yeah. Bill, uh, in a way that's like really doesn't make sense at that time period. And they're so far, I don't have the numbers in my mind right now, but they were so distant to everything else that it's like we don't have any idea of what that is. Yeah. And well not only that, there's thousands of them, they're finding new ones and the jungle all the time. I mean it was an incredible civilization that existed just a couple thousand years ago. The, the Mayan civilization wasn't even that long ago. And we know so little about what really happened. It's, it's an an amazing, amazing time. I watched a great documentary on National Geographic called decoding the Maya.

Speaker 1:          02:00:05       It's available. I bought a DVD of it and it's all about them working on the translations of a, the different Mayan hieroglyphs and how difficult it is and like, like trying to decipher things and the way they go about it and the scientific method they use to try to figure out what the fuck each little thing means. And fascinating stuff. I mean, they had a completely different way of writing the world. They wrote the world in pictures and pictures that represented sounds that you would make and they would vary. It would vary whether or not that sound was like, you know, like if you had like they would like the way it's explained it transport can explain it. Like if you were going to look right, I saw aunt rose, you would do an eyeball a saw like saw and then you do at the insect and, and then you would do a rose and that would be, I saw him, he also had human sacrifice.

Speaker 1:          02:00:57       A lot of it. Yeah. I read Daniel Pinch, Pinch Beck's book. Uh, he seems really interesting. I read actually a, he wouldn't get high with us. You had on the show and we would not get high with the I kid high with, uh, why did you, you don't want to be like, oh, maybe you didn't want to get weirded out. You don't want to be a, what's the word? Like do it for show maybe. I think some people also get uncomfortable when they're high, when they're on and they're talking about things seriously. They didn't want to come up with too much dude, bro Talk. Right. You know they're worried about people seeing them stoned, but I thought he's like the psychedelic pioneer dude. I thought he would hop right in. Yeah. Yeah. I met him when I was in boulder. Anthony Bordain two fisted, like a soldier. We took that due to the depths of unfortunately because

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       it made the conversation kind of weird because he was a little hung over from the grammys. That motherfucker went deep with us, respects our respect. I got respect for you. I could tell how he was too, cause I know it. Unless you're getting this shit on a regular basis that the the there's the kind of marijuana that's available in southern California. It's so potent and so awesome and should be respected for that instead of suppressed by this ridiculous fucking d e a and government. We are in so silly. We're in a new era of prohibition. That's one of the things that are, it's one of things I'm going to legislate and might not actually get it through, but you can start putting the bills out there. What are you going to try to do? It has to be decriminalized. It's not even like the main focus of my campaign, like my thing is bill of rights and spying on us, like ending those things.

Speaker 4:          02:02:25       But do you think it's possible to turn things back and absolutely is possible because uh, the latest polls, like 50% of the American people support decriminalization and legalization, but elected officials only one to 2% support that. So you have a huge disparity where these old assholes have have to go or they have to change their, their a stance because it's not going to stay like that forever. You don't have an elected body that believes a one thing and then 50% of your own people believe something entirely different that doesn't work. And it's not much different than when Galileo was in position. It's really sort of along the same lines we'd cause it grows absolutely everywhere. You find it by railroad tracks and you just pulled out of the ground and it's super nutritious. Yeah. And you can make clothes out of it and you can build buildings out of it as a bottle of whiskey.

Speaker 4:          02:03:10       Do all that. I mean, you could fucking fuel a car with that shit. Really. Realistically, you could take one acre of hemp. It's as good as four acres of trees. If you're trying to make paper, it's the most ridiculous plan ever. I'm not trying to, uh, to pander to your show because I know, I know you talked about this a lot, but like we can't move forward as a country if we're spending so much of our resources on criminalize the something that it's not a crime. Not only that, something that's incredibly, incredibly beneficial. We're suppressing farmer's ability to make money of farmer's ability to make money. By the way, not off selling drugs. We're talking about the actual plant hemp, which is not psychoactive in any way, shape or form. It is not what you won't show. You can eat it. I eat, we sell hemp protein, hemp force protein.

Speaker 4:          02:03:53       One of the biggest questions we get is, am I going to Piss hot for this? I work, you know, at a company that drug test me, should I be like, yeah, you can tell. It's not that. It's nothing to do with that marijuana. It's disgusting to terrifying. I'm of the age where I have a lot of friends who are like trying to get into better positions and they're all worried about drug testing. It's weird because there are all these companies are like preventing themselves from hiring the next batch of innovators. Yeah, of course. Like you're hiring people who are complete boring accountants who have never tried anything. And I'm so offended at this idea that no one can handle drugs. And I, I find that so ridiculous that just because one person can handle it or a few people can handle it doesn't mean I can't handle it because drinking is one of the worst fucking drugs there is period.

Speaker 4:          02:04:37       Right. I can handle it. I enjoy drinking. There's no doubt. You compare how your body feels the next day between the two things. Uh, there's no doubt. There's no comparison. And the idea that I would somehow or another lose control because I've tried something or because I enjoy something in my off time. It's silly if you don't give a person enough respect as your employee that they will go home and sit down in front of the TV and smoke a joint when they, when they relax at home. Right? You don't give them enough respect to have that time to themselves, to maybe smoke a little weed and chill out when they're not riding on the company dime then not doing. They're not responsible for anything. You're going to test them for that. That's ridiculous. You, you're an asshole. You're trying to be a slave owner. You're not trying to be an employee.

Speaker 4:          02:05:20       You can't tell people what to do when they're not at work. It's one thing if you're on an oil, one of those, uh, offshore oil rigs and then you're basically on the job 24 hours a day because anything can go wrong at any time. Completely understand having a zero tolerance policy bear, but for some office job where you have a large portion of your day where you're not working, you should be allowed to do what you want, especially when you're using something that is not killed a single person ever. It's very, very, very good point about dangerous jobs. Very good point. It's not that we're being completely unreasonable and you're like, governments do that in my life. Everywhere. No government government, we should, we should definitely check people out before we let them on planes. We should definitely test people for drugs if they're in charge of oil rigs and you know, even even spine, like people think I'm uh, I'm totally against intelligence agencies have not, like, there's a big role for us to have spy agencies.

Speaker 4:          02:06:10       Like you want to see what these fucking people in Afghanistan and caves are talking about. You want to be tapping their sat talking about how do I make a fire? How do we hold it in this case? How do we get these drones to stop dropping stuff on us? Yeah. What's your position on drones? So drones are really pretty awful for a lot of the same reasons is warrantless spine. There's not enough accountability. Like right now, maybe it's being used properly. We really don't know. But at what point does it just become convenient for a president to say, look, this guy has a major asshole. He's causing us a lot of trouble with all of his, uh, uh, let's say like down the road somebody like Julian Assange was like, let's just get rid of this guy, one drone strike, he's done. And then people will talk about it for a couple of days and that's it.

Speaker 4:          02:06:48       Cause that's how the media cycle works. You know, people would be outraged for a couple days and that's it. So they take their one time, credibility hit and they just move on. And I don't, I don't think that's acceptable. Again, it's too much power for the government to have the, a number of civilian drones is in or civilian casualties because of drones is in the thousands now. I mean it's, it's not just a, a couple of people accidentally die. Also, there's an evil aspect to it. Like it used to be if you wanted to kill somebody, you stabbed them with something and it was pretty intimate, you know, and then it's, it's been depersonalized. That were time. It went from that to start a ride to sniper rifles to you drop something out of a plane. Yeah. But even then, you're still on top of their city. You're looking down, you're pushing the button, you're making a moral choice. Like

Speaker 6:          02:07:36       the evil I'm doing here is outweighed by the benefit it will have of winning this battle or winning this war. The drone. Some guy just goes to work at an army base, plugs in, like he's playing a video game, goes home at night, mission accomplished. You know, it's a, it's a level of separation that is, uh, just scary.

Speaker 2:          02:07:55       Yeah. These civilian drones trikes depending on who you listen to, there's, there's a, there's a couple different figures that they throw around, but all of them are over a thousand from the conservative numbers. The conservative numbers around 1,802 and the less conservative numbers are above 2000. But either that, I mean, all of that, that's scary stuff. That's like nine, 11 numbers. I mean this is the amount of innocent civilians that are killed because we're going after these bad guys and these people just have to be near him. Yeah. It happened to me near him. Allegedly the, there is, I agree completely. There's something crazy about the ability to take some random, you know, object, some, some created object rather and fly it through the fucking air to another country and it launches hell fire missiles at people while you're controlling it with a remote control, like you're watching a video game.

Speaker 6:          02:08:44       And what's, what's so weird about that also is like, so as a society, we're making a choice to devote a lot of our technological energy and definitely taxpayer money to building better drones because these big defense contracts get them. And uh, so we're learning ways to like vaporize 16 year olds in a more efficient manner. Basically these people who are like, you're in some town in Afghanistan, you have no other choices cause there's no economy and some more lord recruits you and you're caught up in something that's definitely evil but you don't have much control over necessarily. And without being given a trial, you're just killed one day by a robot. Basically. That's what it is, is a robot in the sky. I think Bill Maher calls them sky robots. Uh, so you're killed by this thing. And maybe if we need to give huge contracts to defense companies because they lobbied the shit out of Washington, if that's just the way it is, no matter what, we always have to give them massive contracts. Why not go back to what we were doing in the 60s which was part of those massive contracts. We're going to the space program. You know, these companies put us on the moon instead of building drones.

Speaker 2:          02:09:42       Well, let's just cleaning up the inner cities, just strengthening our education system. There's all sorts of jobs that can be had that are very positive. Instead of these jobs that all go to the DEA and busting pot farms and these jobs that all go to Tsa workers grabbing people and sticking them in radiation boxes, they're seen. It seems to me like we should be able to figure out a way to distribute all those people in a positive way back into our economy, back into our work.

Speaker 6:          02:10:10       Yes. And lead police aren't bad everywhere you go. Like I've traveled to a lot of places where the police actually seemed like members of the community in small towns where there's less pressure in small towns and, and other countries where the cops don't have uniforms. So they look like judge Dredd. Like here I've noticed the uniforms could keep getting scarier and scarier. Uh, it depends on the city obviously. But you know, they seen the Cammo. Yeah. Irvine in south Florida,

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       the guys have like body vests on. It wasn't, it wasn't Irvine. What was the, um, the city in Orange County, Anaheim, Anaheim, there was a protest that was a total joke as a total media blackout. That Anaheim thing started to escalate. So nothing about in the news. I had to just Google news it, you know, he just gives routes where Disneyland is bitch, they know how to keep shitting on the raft. Disneyland. But I mean, they had people in camouflage and you're like, what do you, what is the message of you being in camouflage? Is that the only clothes you have? Right? Or are you letting me know that you've killed people? Are you letting me know that you're a trained killer from overseas? You're not looking around number of the community keeping the piece. Are you ready for some serious shit? Yeah. Why are you wearing body armor and why do you have a fucking machine gun and why you standing around when people were protesting the death of, of uh, you know, a young man was shot in the back, the whole thing.

Speaker 1:          02:11:19       How about the fucking guy that shot himself in the head in the backseat? That was fucked up. I don't think we ruled it a suicide. I don't believe that for a second. But the, the brazen act of ruling that the suicide, that, that shit is completely ridiculous. How the fuck did they get away with that? Right. It's part of when you could get a society that's corrupt, you have corrupt rulings, but the fact that people would be willing to just listen to that and go, yeah, wow, okay. I shouldn't have shot himself in the head. You pull the guy over, you arrest him and he's like, this is it. My life's over. I'm going to shoot myself in the head while I'm handcuffed behind my back and I'm a shoot myself in the temple. Yeah. The next few hours is going to be inconvenient being processed, so I'm just going to kill myself.

Speaker 1:          02:11:58       Yeah. I mean, no sense. I'm going to put it up to my temple too. Yeah. How can you even fucking do that? Can you even do that? Well, what you have to be like a yoga chick. What scares me is when these videos come out of police just beating the shit out of somebody for no reason and you wonder like how many times is this happening, where the right conditions weren't there, where there happened to be somebody who had the balls and the camera and the camera to actually film it. You know, when I was in high school, my friend Jimmy was, uh, in, um, there's a place called Kenmore Square in Boston and this is back when they had, um, they had dudes who would, uh, put cardboard down on the street and they would break dance. Yeah, I used to do that. Remember that ship?

Speaker 1:          02:12:39       It was really popular. Well, there was break dancers and these punkers, there was like a, a bar there. There's so, there's like these punk people and these breakdowns. People got into a fucking crazy bra and the cops come and showed up and patty wagons and he said he had never seen anything like it. Dudes were just swinging those bats and cow racking people in the head because there's no video, there's no, no one's monitoring them. He said they would crack people in the head. He goes, the sound was so sickening. And then they would take their head and slam it into the patty wagon before they go in. Everyone just slam their fucking head into the metal and then toss them in. He said it was so disturbing that like watching it and they're like, he never looked at cops the same way again. Just watching them just get cracked in the head by bats and then slam their head into the metal and then push them in because they were involved in a big brawl. Right. And that was back when people had brawls where they didn't shoot each other. They just beat each other up. Like those don't exist anymore.

Speaker 6:          02:13:37       Allegedly. Some of those occupy protesters, they like what handcuffed them in a way that's painful using the plastic cuffs and they show them all into vans and, uh, they were in there for so long, they're forced to urinate on each other. Even like they were denied access to a bathroom when they asked for one. And uh, you, you hear about this all the time, like where they're doing the handcuffs so hard that people are screaming from going to be like fixed, you know, and they just don't care. It's so sick. That's not, that's not, uh, that's not what America is about. You know, we have the freedom of protest. So when I see people protesting, I'm actually kind of excited because it means that people are engaging again. You know, they're like, okay, I care about this issue. I'm going to tell you what I think of it. That's a good thing. Uh, having debate and discussion, that's, that's a sign of life, you know, and they're treating it like it's this threat to our existence in a threat to national security. It's super creepy.

Speaker 1:          02:14:24       One of the creepy things was a, we had Jamie Kilstein on who's been a very involved in the occupy process from the beginning, and he was talking to me about cops that have products, no cops, police officer, police officers that have infiltrated and they pretend yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:14:39       To be, uh, yeah, the agent provocateurs. Yeah. That, that strikes me is one of the most fucked up things also that you get paid for that public protest. It's peaceful and isn't harming the community. Then you have exactly you of taxpayer money going into turning this into a violent death

Speaker 1:          02:14:55       orderly thing. It should be. So you can bust people who would not have been an issue in the first place. It'd be treason. Yeah. It should be complete treason. If you find out that someone has ever done that and they have done that, it should be absolutely treasonous. You should go to jail. You have, you fucked up the, the, the civil discourse of this situation that is against the Sim, the community, your, your, you are, your actions are undermining the piece of the community. Yeah. You should go to jail. They should all in the fact that it just, we're just allowed that and we just sort of accept that that level of, of not, not just incompetence on the part but, but real corruption. It's not in competence. It's institutional. Like you said, it's not the people at the bottom level who are the problem.

Speaker 1:          02:15:34       Somebody up top is saying, look, you better rough these protesters up cause we don't want them coming back next weekend and they're so stupid. This is the, this, the incompetence is that this is the only way they feel like they can handle it and let's even stupid or is this what's going to lead to bigger protest? Of course, because the denial of, of, of equality, the fact that they won't consider these, that these people are a part of the community. When the community is having this much problem with your action, you're doing something wrong. There's something wrong, there's an, then there's an injustice. It's not an unreasonable, ridiculous thing. Like, you know, some crazy person's saying, you stole all my money from the golden giant. No, you're, you're talking like real sense and deciding and you're being ignored. And when that happens, it's, it's right to protest. It's American to protest. It's patriotic to protest. It shows that you're, you're stepping outside of the box to say, hey, I am one. I want to be counted amongst the people that think there's something wrong with this. That's what America is supposed to be all about. So the problem with Americans, it's run by an American's.

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       It's run by people who are not. I have a lot of people who believe that nine 11 was like the opportunity of a lifetime. Yeah. You know, get a better, get a better position within the government, make a shitload of money on these crazy contracts, doing spying programs and putting body scanners and airports and all this stuff. A lot of people made money off of this and I consider that quite unamerican to profit off of a tragedy like that and in such a blatant way. You know what was quite unamerican have Dick Cheney as a vice president. Yeah. How crazy is that? To have this guy who was a vice president who used to be the CEO of a company that fixes shit after you book? Well, the whole thing there, if we weren't corrupt, we should have just said, okay great. You're a CEO of Halliburton, no big deal, but no government contracts while you're in office.

Speaker 4:          02:17:13       We're not sending a penny to Halliburton cause it's a total conflict of interest. You know, I don't understand why government gets away with things that in the financial sector would just be considered ludicrous. Insider trading. Exactly thing much less horrible than that. Yeah. It just knew that a company was going to fold and you sold your stock. Yep. That seems like a smart business move, but that's completely and totally illegal. If this motherfucker had the, the access to this entire giant business that rebuild things after you bought and he was the guy running it. Yeah. And then he gives them contracts. No bid contracts for billions and billions of dollars. Dan is so blatant and in your face, it's so crazy. It's kind of like, it's like what are you going to do about it? You know, the media is not going to cover it all that much and we know you're not going to protest because he might get the shit kicked out of you. So what are you gonna do about it? We're just gonna do it anyway. Shit. That's totally an American. Yeah, that's totally UNAMERICAN. Does anybody, does Alpha brain make you curse more? Just being

Speaker 3:          02:18:07       here with us the other day I saw the creepiest thing ever in Burbank and I immediately raised a really the creepiest thing ever. You want to clarify that? It was pretty creepy and then I found a video of it. Yeah. I've been like searching to see if anyone else saw it. What was that? Check this out, but just tell me what it was. It's a tons of tanks is going through on the train track.

Speaker 4:          02:18:28       Oh my readers, my readers have sent me that stuff. Different videos from different parts of the country. Yeah. It's creepy. It could totally be like just the normal, uh, it's coming off of a factory line has to be shipped somewhere else. You were going to send me something like cats, butthole or something. But isn't it weird that we're now at the point where our government really is doing so many terrible things that we see tanks and our first thought is, are they going to use these against us? Can you imagine that? Can you imagine a World War II? Like you see a line of tanks? You'd be like, hell yeah. You won't be like, I hope they don't use this against us. The real problem is when they don't need drivers. Yeah. And when you get us the real problem [inaudible] man drowns. When you have a few people running these fucking things by remote control, they can, they can take over cities and do a lot of shit.

Speaker 4:          02:19:12       That's impossible to do when you don't have an evil cunt behind the switch. But if they just have a few dudes work in somewhere pushing all the buttons for these fucking things, you watched the new total recall, hell no sun. They have the synthetic where they just turn that thing on and they all go out and I think we're going to fuck things up way before that ever happens. Hopefully. But this, this is disturbing man. Knowing this is drones and knowing all the thousands of people that have died that were totally innocent because the drones, no, the fact that no one seems to have a problem with that because we don't know those little brown people. We don't know them. Yeah, I'm not, I'm not afraid of the technology. Like it's the technology is the technology. You can never turn it back. Like drones are now a part of warfare.

Speaker 4:          02:19:53       That's the way it goes. Yeah. The problem I have is a total lack of accountability. Who are these people? Why are they being targeted? Did they deserve to be killed or could they have been detained and questioned? Not only that, given a trial, these people that are deciding who to go after and who not to go after and what is your motivation and what ties do you have to have the burden, what times do you have to, how much money, how much money do you make? One of those missiles goes off somebody, you know, what does a contract for a hundred new missiles worth? Is it worth a lot because it seems like a good motivation to invade someplace where there's nobody paying attention to anyways, fuck him up. Just fucking get rid of some missiles. It's crazy. It's crazy that people could try to make money doing that, but there's so much money in doing that.

Speaker 4:          02:20:35       You have to consider it. Look at Afghanistan, it's like, uh, I was talking to somebody about this. Our whole policy is like, okay, we can send them some school supplies and occupied their country with our military forces for a few years and then they're going to have democracy. It's just going to spring up because those people are like literally a thousand years behind where we are literally like, it's like the, it's like tattoo in and star wars. Like they're not there yet. There are certain bridges that need to be built. You don't just go from like localized warlords and this creepy desert that has like insane looking spiders. Actually that's an Iraq. They have camel spiders. They're fed people. Those on fear factor. Yeah, that's, I don't like the idea that they eat him alive. Camel spiders should be eating people, not the other way around. They're creepy looking alien bugs.

Speaker 4:          02:21:21       They were gigantic. They would fit right in starship troopers. Yeah. Yeah. But anyway, like that part of the world is not ready for like three years. Going from localized warlords to functioning democracy. We can pull out, we're done. It's just an to happen. How far behind it really, truly is. I remember McCain referring it to it. Mccain was debating Obama and he was saying like, he doesn't understand what he's talking about when you're talking about invading Afghanistan. Afghanistan has run the same way it was when, you know the people who were on horseback, it was like Alexander the Great, yeah, yeah. I just saw a headline today. Uh, the Taliban beheaded a bunch of people and their crime was going to a party that was mixed sex. So there are men and women listening to music together and drinking together. Boom. I mean, oh my God, that's how far behind they are. They are so willing to take it to the next level like that. That is how you really control people. I mean that you chop their fucking heads off in the middle of the streets and nobody does shit. And what does that do? It creates a, yeah, it chills that, that's not gonna happen again. But we know that that's, and that's what's

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       really disturbing about human nature. And then in 2012 we have direct evidence that people who are in positions of power are capable of doing something that fucked up. And if you really believe that people are all the same, the only differences we have different cultures and different environments and different biological, you know, makeups and different ways we look. But essentially people are equal. Well, in 2012 people are cutting people's heads off for nonsense. That's what people in power are capable of doing. And we've got a look honestly and realistically about the people that are in power right here. Because just because you could drive a Saab and go to Starbucks and get Wifi at work, just because all that's going on doesn't mean you're not living in a den of monster. And not only that, just because you have those good things, you have a safe town and you have Starbucks and like a level of prosperity that's really pretty good.

Speaker 2:          02:23:20       You don't wanna let that go. It's awesome. Yeah. And addressing all the bad stuff that's happening isn't going to take that away from you. It'll actually give you more of it because it's less money will be going to this bullshit. More money will be going into programs that will keep your town safe and clean. When we think about America, we think about all the good things about America and not only will none of that change, it will all be enhanced because that more people will be providing more positive things into the city instead of our cities and our countries and our states being governed by this giant fucking monster that goes overseas and blow shit up. Instead of that, all of the tax money, all of the resources go to building shit, go to building shit within here, this country making this place better, cleaning up all the bullshit that all these fucking corporations have left behind in terms of toxic waste poisoning and figure out how to manage nuclear waste to fix all of it here though all of it to this nonsense where the our, our whole economy is based on fucking people out of their shit and another place.

Speaker 2:          02:24:22       That's craziness. It's maybe you should run also fuck fan. I would love to hear like a Mitt Romney or somebody say basically that we need to then I need to end outsourcing. We bring these jobs home. I will never be a part of this system because this system is bullshit to me. This system is like, you might as well go to the rocky horror picture show and pretend because you're singing along that you're actually in the movie because you're not really changing what's going to happen. You're, you're not really a part of it. You're not. It's this system is completely fucked sideways with corruption and to for you to jump in and try to right the ship from the inside. But man, good luck to you. I'm, I'm in your corner, Dude. You're going to try to do it and you're going to run for Congress and I, I'm, I'm wanting to support you and I want you to win and I want you to get into the positions where you can actually make some change, but to, in order to do that, man, that has to be literally your whole life.

Speaker 2:          02:25:11       That has to be your whole life just to correct the work of some clients. Instead of telling the cons to stop being cuts, just just get your own shit together. The people that are in the upper positions of power, that must be fucking creepy, paranoid and depressed and weirded out and on Colona Pan and all kinds of other cooking weird drugs to get you through your day and Xanax and Ambien to go to sleep at night. Do you know how many successful wealthy people in business I know that are addicted to Ambien? They're popping that shit every night to try to get some sleep because they can't because they're crazy because they're dealing with all kinds of nonsense all day and fuckery a foot every step of the way, and they, they literally can't even fucking sleep. They can't relax. And everybody goes through this existential crisis where you're like, what the fuck is this all about? But there's no answer. So you'd go buy new Jaguar, there's no answer. So you get a new membership to the country club and now you're, now you're living behind the coming. Oh. I was like, no, it's great in your mood or Bob and you just keep pushing.

Speaker 6:          02:26:13       I think a lot of it's a proxy for not getting sex too. Yeah. Fuck yeah. A lot of these dudes in the senator just old and like pro despite hurt me, but probably can't get it up anymore. Actually. They could probably get it up, but now if I add, but point is they're not what they used to be and instead of pulling all these girls they used to pull, they have to feel so of veer, veer aisle by passing this shit. That is ridiculous. Like just totalitarian stuff. I think a small part of it is like if you're getting sex regularly and you have a balanced life that also involves like friends and family and doing stuff that has nothing to do with politics or with building drones or any of that stuff, why would you even be in favor of these things? You're not going to be, you're not going to be in that direction of let's start a war to make some money or let's take away rights just to be on the safe side. You know? You're not going to think that way.

Speaker 2:          02:27:01       Yeah, that's a very good point as well. If you're operating from a position of comfort and power and empowerment, you're, you're, you feel yourself that you're doing what you should be doing and you're very confident about everything. You're not going to try to suppress or other people. And that's the problem with the old people. A lot of old people want to suppress young people. It's very common. They see people coming up and they shit on them. You know, I remember that from the, the comedy days, you know, the, the older comedians, there was two types of older comedians. There was a really cool encouraging guys who would uh, you know, tell you, hey, you got to write more. You know, you should like go to his much on stage as you can get the better and give you good advice and good luck man. If you ever have questions, I'm here.

Speaker 2:          02:27:37       And those guys are great. You know those guys like they, they, you meet a guy like that, that like a life raft. But then there's other guys that just see coming up and they just want to push it down and shit on you. We want to hold you in place and they act like they can. This guy, I don't want them working with me. He says, fuck too much. She breaks the fuck meter. Like why you creepy Dick then? But that's a, that's the same. It's just crabs in a bucket. They're just trying to hold people down. Yeah. And when you get to a position where you're a guy like that where your guy like Newt Gingrich and they go, hey man, boxers or briefs you go by, what kind of idiotic question is that you think I'm not going to answer. What are you stupid? You know? And then he'd just berate some poor kid who just asked you a cute question about your underwear. I think that says something about your character too. So literally it does. It says something about you being a bully. Like Watch your bench. I'm talking about like boxers or briefs.

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       Yeah. But yeah, totally like that response to reporter a Mitt Romney did something similar. He was in Colorado and a TV report or not even like a random person. A TV reporter asked him about something about marijuana policy, which in a state like Colorado where it's a big part of their economy is not a crazy question and he was like pissed that it was asked and you know, didn't want to address it. No, not only that, there's a terrible defining video where there's a patient who has some sort of debilitating disease and he's in a wheelchair and he asked Mitt Romney what his stances on medical marijuana. It's just because it helps him. It helps him eat. It helps. It alleviates his pain and symptoms. A lot of them he's telling Mitt Romney that he benefits from this. Well, I'm against it. I'm against medical marijuana. I don't know what to tell Ya.

Speaker 1:          02:29:06       I'm against it. Just like no compassion, no real connection with this person. And to me it's such a telling video of who Mitt Romney really is. He is a guy who is willing to play the role of the puppet to 80 people. Never varied from the v vary from the script. He's stuck on the policy line. It's so scary. It's terrifying. It's not a real person. He said, he doesn't even know what the fuck he's a Mormon. Stop. Just don alone. That that's a can of worms. It's crazy. I can't believe at a 314 million people, that's our current population at the best we can come up with is Obama who has a record now of promoting things that the Bush administration would not have even done. Like there is a former Bush administration official said that NDA was something that their administration would not have tried and would not have even found acceptable.

Speaker 1:          02:29:55       And so you have Obama doing these things so we know where he stands. Let me have Mitt Romney and those are our two best choices out of all the talent and energy in this country. That's what we were. And the, the answer is, of course, those aren't our best choices. Those are the people who were put forward. You know, Mitt Romney, I had no part in him becoming, uh, you know, our pick, most people didn't have a say in that and it just happened. And I mean, there were better choices out there and they weren't given enough attention. Well, the Ron Paul issue was the, the greatest issue when you want to talk about someone who has rallied behind by so many different people. And Ron Paul himself is a, a radical Christian and in fact it doesn't even support the theory of evolution. It doesn't bother me cause he leaves it up church, he leaves the church, he leaves it there.

Speaker 1:          02:30:37       When it's influencing policy, then I have to look at all the other and when you want to infringe upon other people's rights and yet you believe in some wackiness that has to be brought into the equation now as long as you keep it to yourself, we're cool. As long as you don't fuck with people. And you really go, by the way, this country was initially founded a separation, a true separation of church and state because people were coming here because they face religious persecution in other lands and they said, listen, let's just work it out. So we keep that shit out of this. Agree. Yep. Yeah. Founded our founding documents. We're still beautiful like the bill and the bill of rights. Like now you see contracts like the terms of use on iTunes or whatever and it's like difficult to get through cause it's so long.

Speaker 1:          02:31:16       The bill of rights threatened so you could be like a 15 year and understand it perfectly with no legal background. So simple like you have a right to the freedom of speech and peaceful assembly. Now these are rights. You have them, we're not going to bury it and some kind of legal lees. The the the only problem that I ever have with someone who is in a, we call it a cult or a religion or anything like that, like, like being a Mormon is that you're so committed to it. It's not that I don't think Mormonism can help you and make you a better person because like I said, I know they're really nice people that are Mormons. It's just if you're willing to believe that, what else do you believe? Right? What else? What do, how much is that going to affect your choices?

Speaker 1:          02:31:52       What kind of weird apocalyptic shit should somebody put into your head? If you really truly do believe that a 14 year old boy from 1820 found golden tablets that contain the loss work of Jesus and that the American Indians were actually a tribe that came here from Israel. Right. And the other original Israelites, like not a lot of, not a lot of evidence for that. Well, not a lot of 14 year old kids in are completely full of shit. And once I start talking about angels dropping off packages of gold and then taking them away before the people could come and read them and they had a magic stones to look at them with like this isn't even well-written. Yeah. It's like this is crazy if that, if someone had tried to say that today, there's no way he would listen to them. If a guy came to me today and said, listen, maybe the definition of craziness exactly you would, but because it's old people go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:32:38       But back then it was real. If it happened today, what would you do? You would say, well, there's 14 year old kid is obviously full of shit on the miracles in the Bible. It's like, where did all this stuff go? Like it happened all the time back then and now it's like, yeah, the real problem with board, the miracles have happened. By the way, that dude, a captain Sally, that was a miracle. Like that'll probably be in our, whatever we have is a bible like 2000 years from now, they'll mention that the skillful, skillful landing, skillful but also a brilliant job kind of water kind of a miracle. You think so? Well and the sense that uh, you have a plane crash and like, uh, like the media covers it in such a negative way for so long. And this one was like, just not what you see.

Speaker 1:          02:33:19       So I think it was a miracle, like in the sense that, uh, maybe it was just a skillful landing. I don't know what the odds are, is a man who became a fucking saved people. He manned up, he did what? He's an expert pilot and he did what he was trained to do in that situation. He did it perfectly and he handled himself under pressure in heroic fashion. I don't think you should say that's a miracle. I think that's a man with character that should be admired. I don't think there's anything miraculous about it. I think it was training and long, long hours in the job and, and, and, and the expert ability to handle an airplane. And he just did it in a perfect way where some people would have fucking panicked and fell apart and killed everybody on that plane. That's a lot of people.

Speaker 1:          02:33:54       I Dunno, I'm sticking with miracle. I think when it gets, when it gets a pass down the line enough times, it's going to be that like Jesus's hands slowly glided that thing down. It's the water. It's probably already there. Maybe there's someone who was on the plane who was praying that's taking full credit for maybe it was one of the horrible things about the Colorado thing was the guy who was claiming that the reason why he was spared and all these other people including young children were killed, is that, uh, he was, uh, spare to, to let people know how great God is. Crazy people suck. They suck man. As, and especially when you realize that it's probably some really cool people that got shot and this asshole know, thinks that the reason why they got shot and he didn't is because he was thinking the right things. And he was, uh, hoping to God that he could, he could spread God's word like, come on man. How about you got lucky and it's a shame that this cunt killed all these people. How about that? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:34:49       Or like I won the football game because I prayed to Jesus. What about the like millions of people killed and all these different countries. It's just sort of were none of them praying, you know, like, and yet the did the outcome of your football match is being divinely decided, you know, it's so creepy that that doesn't drive everyone nuts. It's so Korean kind of how I kind of hope for uh, sorry to cut you off. I kind of hope for like some kind of alien invasion, not even an alien invasion. Just I hope that one day NASA comes out and says, by the way, they're aliens. Like they might come here, they might not, but we found out their alien somewhere and they had been monitoring us. Everything we do, just the fact they're aliens, then it's like we all have to come together as a people because we're now one planet and we have to defend against these other things so we can't get caught up in bullshit. Like what is your old book say versus Mild Book, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:35:38       Yeah. We will have to deal with reality as it actually exists right now. What are our resources? How can we defend ourselves if we can? Exactly. You know, the most compelling idea about alien life. To me it was an alien that that alien consciousness is creativity. And that it's creating our society by planting the seed of creativity in the modern animal, the modern monkey animal, and forcing it to eventually pursue it's doom and that they, it has to, it is absolutely compelled to fuck with manner, to the point where it seals its own doom. Wow. And then it's like a, a builtin program in us. And that it's a design. That's how you blow up planets. That's how you fuck with planets along method. It just inject creativity and, and, and, and uh, the need for constant innovation, bigger, better things. And eventually they just blow the whole thing sky high.

Speaker 1:          02:36:26       It's an inevitable, it's an unavoidable, awful and beautiful at the same time. Well, I mean it's, it all comes from our desire to understand our surroundings better and our desire to improve. But why is that? If we ultimately are temporary being shit and we stop at a certain point and say, all we need is food and all we need is a comfort and let's enjoy our comradery. While we're here and get through this thing in a very, very healthy and spiritual way, but we're like, nope, not interested in that. Interested in a bigger fucking TV and I want some pills and make me sleep at night and is there a way I can get the Internet on my glasses? I want to look through my fucking glasses and read my email. I don't want to ever know where any direction is. I want my car to drive me Google glasses, I want my phone to have a million photos of it

Speaker 4:          02:37:07       on it. We were in some weird weird cycle where it's like you've seen runner, right? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:37:16       So there are program. Tony lived for four years, then they die. So they know. I mean, they're upset about that, but also it forces you to be in the present and that's what we are. You don't know. You're not going to be dead within four years or what's the difference? What's the difference between four years or 40 years, you know? Right. You're going to be dead soon and you have these memories in your past that have been implanted in a sense. Like, I mean you've had, you have real memories of what you've done, but at the end of the day it's all your perception was that like the memory is kind of like this false, it's take this false security like okay, I've done a lot of cool shit in the past so I can just ride for a little while and not do anything. But really you can't do that cause you don't know how much time you have left.

Speaker 2:          02:37:55       Well not only that, then you become a fat fuck and a loser. Yeah. Cause that's what happens to people when they give up on trying. They get fat and they get stupid and they quit and they just lay around and do nothing until they die. That's someone who's not enjoying their life. They've lit, rested on their laurels. It's um, it's weird to be temporary. So weird feeling. We don't like it. That's why religion exists exists in the first place. It's almost like a scaffolding to sort of get us through it while we're constructing some new level of consciousness. It's like, let me just give you some shit to think about this. What's going to happen. The the really promising feeling that you get from psychedelic drugs is that what you experience is so stupendously alien to what you experience on an everyday day to day basis that it gives you hope for some really complex structure to the universe that's unavailable to you when you're in a straight and normal a form and state of consciousness.

Speaker 2:          02:38:48       And that there might be chemical doorways to different dimensions and chemical doorways to different experiences. And that's essentially what your whole neuro chemistry and your whole life is based on your series of chemicals, adrenaline when Shit goes wrong and you need to fight or flight. You know Sarah Tonin when you have babies and delve, I mean when you see people that you love and you'd go outside and it's sunny and I mean there's a, there's all sorts of chemical releases that are constantly going on that bring you to altered states of consciousness. And we know that the brain produces some very extreme psychedelic chemicals. So it just stands to reason to me that this, this idea that the only thing that's real is some shit that you can touch with your hands. And that this dimension and this experience is the only thing that's real because it's what we're conscious of and what we're involved in right now. I say, I say no fucking way. I say it's much more likely that this thing is way more complicated than we can even imagine. And that we are silly little ants walking around on a dog's ass trying to describe the universe.

Speaker 6:          02:39:45       Of course it would be much better if I didn't fuck up that last word. I think it's weird that like old societies, uh, the people that they look to for advice and for counsel or like Shamans who knew the most about taking these kinds of journeys. And also they had an ancient Greece. They supposedly had the oracle and they were, from what I understand, under the influence of some kind of psychedelic drug, which helped them come up with their prophecies or whatever. Uh, so this is where people look to and today our leaders, the people who know the least about these

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       things, like a guy like Paul Ryan and claims that he's never smoked, never smoked pot. He says that's what somebody, somebody sent me a link to it. It didn't read the whole article, but I think you said it was in Gq. He claims he's never smoked pot. He's a silly bitch. If that's true. It's one of two things, right? We were talking about us before the show. Either he's a Dork and you don't want him to be president either he's a liar, he's a tool or he's a liar. Yeah. Most people have either thought about, well I know actually I should say that I know a lot of people that haven't because they grew up with families where the father had a problem or the mother had a problem or both. I have seen that and uh, I've seen people who have become very successful and are adamant against any form of drug.

Speaker 1:          02:40:56       They have never had a drop of alcohol, they have never had marijuana. And I respect them greatly for that choice because what that choice is for them is that they don't want to go down the path that they have seen their own loved ones go down. So those things are the enemy, those substances, although maybe they can handle it and maybe they couldn't get to them, those substances are weak and those are the right. Well those are the respect that those are like some of the guys who run these rehab centers, they were once alcoholics, so they were once drug addicts and they had the worst experience possible. So then they're like, I don't want anybody else to go through this. Maybe some people can handle it better than you did. You know, just cause you fucked up your life. So important doesn't mean that nobody else can enjoy like a couple of beers and they're out on a date or like out of fundraiser or something, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:41:35       I mean there's people that can't handle anything. They can't handle any social situation. They stammer, they fucking panic. Their character shows, you know, people's character can show in psychedelic experiences, just like you can show in a social experience. You know, there's, um, one of the things that happens when someone is first learning. Jujitsu is a, the first time you get tapped. It's a very humiliating feeling when you have to give up. It's very, it made you feel angry. It feels very personal and it takes a very strong person to get through that. And it's just the very beginning of Jujitsu, which is the hardest part. When you get tapped, what does that mean? Like the guy you have doubt give up. No, no, no. The, Oh, you and apoe coal or an arm bar. Physically tap the path to let them know you quit. You quit because they're going to kill you.

Speaker 1:          02:42:20       You, if the guy has your back and he's choking you and you're tapping, you're essentially admitting that he's about to put you unconscious with that choke and you're giving up. So you're doing the olive garden basically. That's not quitting or you doing, you're doing the olive garden. The a seven times it did the olive garden, the safe word. Oh, the say for it. That's why I forgot we had admitted that or we came up with that earlier. No, it's the tapping out as the second point. I understand what you were saying. I'm like, is he involved in this off guard and prank as well? Yeah, that's our safe word. It means that's what you do, but it's very emotional for a lot of, a lot of guys, especially when they first start doing it, it really freaks them out. They don't like it at all. I've had guys that like the first time they've ever done Jujitsu and you see them hyperventilate, like a guy gets on top of them and then they panic because they think that they're about to get God and they've never had that happen to them before. Right. Once it happens to a few times, once you do it a bunch of times and then you get used to doing it to other people, then it becomes accepted

Speaker 2:          02:43:11       normal part of your everyday life and you're not terrified of the struggle. The struggle becomes a straw. It's just becomes reality. It becomes a part of reality instead of something you're absolutely, completely terrified of. So in getting through that, you develop some character. He developed some of the ability to overcome adversity and you develop the ability to overcome very uncomfortable moments, but you don't have to do it just through Jujitsu. You can do that shit through yoga. You know, Yoga, yoga sounds ridiculous, but yoga positions are really fucking hard to hold, man. And if you give up in the middle of the position, you feel like a bitch, you know, you feel like it. All right, I'm going to go back to it. And then you'll try it. Hold it again. But you, you gave up, you could have hung in there and you could have waited until the, the lady says next she can do it.

Speaker 2:          02:43:55       How come you can't do it? Right? You can't do it because you haven't pushed yourself to the position where you can do it. And once you do push yourself, when then you can do it. Then you have this wave of accomplishment and it's feeling and this understanding like, oh, it's difficult to do shit. Like everything doesn't come easy and the thing that companies, they come easy, they aren't, they aren't shit. The things that you really enjoy, the things that are really fucking hard to do and unfortunately we have a lot of people that are running shit that don't have control of their character. They have not done difficult things. They have not tested their ego. They have not broken there will, they have not been broken and training. They have not developed a real character. What they've developed is a sort of a fake personality that they have devised that society wants and will accept.

Speaker 2:          02:44:39       So they're saying all the right things because those right things make people think I like you Mike. You're a good Christian and you hold that milk like a 1950s commercial. You know what I mean? They become something that think people would like to hear. We need an economy where a man gets credit for starting his own business. You did build it yourself. I mean built your minimum wage job all by herself. Is that guy, what is, what is he doing? Is he being dizzy or aware of who he is? Because I don't really think you can be aware of who you are unless you have some form of a transcendent experience. That transcendent experience could be a fucking vision quest where you hike to the top of Mount Everest or death experiences. A lot of people change after that. They're like, oh this shit, this shit really doesn't matter.

Speaker 2:          02:45:24       They certainly do. They certainly do perspective wise. And they also do because the, the release of endogenous psychedelic chemicals that happen in the near death experience, people in near death experiences have some really fucking vivid hallucinations that um, by the way, a mirror, the ones where they've injected people with dimethyltryptamine, which is a chemical that your brain produces when you're dreaming. So they've injected people with dimethyltryptamine and they have also have these intense psychedelic experiences that were very similar to the experiences of people that people had during near death experiences. What people saw the bright light and they went through the tunnel and they cut to another side and all of that shit mirrors and mimics the experiences that our rep, you could replicate them with psychedelic chemicals that the brain makes. So all of it to that. There's a lot of different things that can happen to a person where they get a fresh perspective and in near death experiences.

Speaker 2:          02:46:15       One of them for a variety of reasons, just so you know, perspective, the fact that it was almost over, man, maybe I need to rethink my life. Not even just for the, the high that you get from those chemicals, flooding your brain, but both, both, both of them together. But I think you need to do something in life, man. People need a quest. They need a vision. They need, they need something that tests their character and in a way that doesn't hurt other people. And if it, you know, even if you heard, well, you know, you mean you heard of the people through competition. That's, that's sort of a voluntary thing. And I'll give you engage in martial arts competition. You're going to hurt people, but they're going to hurt you too. But you will also grow. And then you will also grow from it because it's so fucking difficult and the body can heal and it's worth it as in terms of what it can do for your character.

Speaker 2:          02:46:58       Can you develop your character in ways that are really unavailable for people who are not tested? And it doesn't mean tested necessarily tested physically. They can be tested mentally. It can be a meditation thing. It could be getting over, you know, uh, various aspects of, of, of uh, understanding of your yourself, exploring the mind. It can be a bunch of different things, but you gotta be tested in this fucking life, like real legitimately tested. You can't just jump into a fucking party of Douche bags that are currently running shit and act like they want you to act. Then all of a sudden you're some position of power and you're some weird Mitt Romney care probably doesn't even know who the fuck he is.

Speaker 4:          02:47:34       Well, it sounds how to make money. It's like those people who are like Xda and they're like, they come out against drugs and all this shit and you're like, yeah. Too Bad. You weren't able to speak up when you were actually in that position. He come out for drugs and come out illegal. We against what's happening. And then you're like, too bad you couldn't say a single word about that while you were actually in that position deciding policy. You know

Speaker 2:          02:47:54       Michael Rupert is a, a friend of the show and he's been on and a couple of times and Michael Rupert was a cop in the 1980s during the whole Iran Contra affair, went on television, exposed the CIA selling drugs in south central Los Angeles and he exposed the whole thing. And you know, this is a guy who was a fucking former narcotics officer and he saw them selling it and it was like, you know what? Fuck this. This is crazy. I'm out of here. And he, he did do what he should do. William Binney, right? Like William Benny. Exactly. But much like William Benny. So his life is in chaos since then, you know, I mean, it's uh, to, to run around like this guy, this port mathematician and get guns. Putting your face for what exactly? For what? For exposing something that is like mean this guy is a pain.

Speaker 4:          02:48:41       Yeah. For exposing something that is really destructive to the constitution. And trap wire. Let's talk about that. Uh, I know this is rude, but can I do another Pittsburgh? Oh yeah. You're an elemental. We got five minutes, Joe. We've got a little baby bladder. I need to get to trap wire. Can you hold, can you hold it, hold it. Hold trap wire for people. Because this is apparently the longest podcast we've ever done. We only have five minutes. Yep. Shit. Trap wire, uh, came out

Speaker 6:          02:49:08       of, so wiki leaks and one of their latest batches of emails has a bunch of correspondence within this company called Strat for, which is a private intelligence firm. It's kind of like the privatized version of the CIA. And I think the CIA would be offended by that comparison because Strikeforce seems a lot less competent, uh, than the CIA. But straight forwards just this private intelligence company, they gather information, uh, for a variety of clients like private corporations. I think coca cola has used them before. Just gather information on whatever they need. Uh, don't hold me to Coca Cola, but I'm pretty certain they've used them. They have big clients, big fortune 500 companies, and they get data and do all this stuff anyway. And the emails that the strap for executives are sending back and forth. A lot of confidential stuff was revealed about all kinds of things that the public is not supposed to know about.

Speaker 6:          02:49:54       And one of those was a company called trap wire, which, uh, developed a computer algorithm that basically tracks people using public surveillance cameras. That's the best way to describe it. Uh, using things like gait recognition, the way you walk, uh, it can potentially recognize you from one spot to the next and it can flag you for suspicious behavior, but you don't know what the suspicious behaviors are. They think it can be something like just taking photographs of a landmark that flags you into the system or a signaling for your family to come over so that they can take a photo with you, things like that. Or just loitering in an area for too long. So this computer program, it's not a person with judgment. This computer algorithm decides you're suspicious individual and a threat, and then puts you into their system and profiles you. And then when you go somewhere else, like let's say you're initially flagged somewhere in the state of Texas, that a couple months later you're on vacation in New York, one of the subway cameras in New York.

Speaker 6:          02:50:48       Can we identify you and build a file of where you've been, where you know and predict your behavior, possibly even predict where you might go next based on where you've been. Just another way that government, uh, and private corporations might be tracking people without their approval. I mean, this is a clear violation of the fourth amendment. We can't stop this podcast, Brian, we have to talk about those. Let's stop it and start it again until you get eight minutes. So I think you, can I give you a fake buffer just because I notice you and don't pay attention. Yeah. So trap artist is just a such a, such a, so it's a crazy situation. It's a company where their clients are mixed. Some of their clients are a powerful government agencies. And I think even the u s military uses this software at army bases and this is all legal.

Speaker 6:          02:51:34       Well, I personally don't think it's legal. I think it just hasn't. It's something that nobody would have known about had it not been for wikileaks and the hacker who allegedly brought these emails out is now riding in a jail right now. Now, this whole wikileaks situation about him being in the Ecuador embassy, how crazy is that? That is completely crazy that this is our big right now, this is the US government's one of our biggest priorities is this dude and this dude, by the way, they're trying to get him out under this most ridiculous charge of surprise sex. Right? That's what it is. What it, what it

Speaker 2:          02:52:06       is is he had sex with a woman and I guess the alleged story is that he did it with a condom on and then they were lying in bed together with no condom and he stuck it in again and it's, it's craziness. Well craziness. If they're willing to like, that's the going after this guy, a woman that he actually had said, yeah, it was a douchebag move. I mean, if she wanted to wear a condom and you didn't, I mean that's a douchebag move for sure, but you're going to have this gigantic manhunt for him where he has to hold himself up in a fucking embassy and to, to avoid extradition to this country for, and it just so happens that he's the guy that releases all this information that shows helicopters gunning people down the street, mistaken them for, for terrorists.

Speaker 6:          02:52:45       Yeah. Well the thing with wikileaks, uh, when they reveal stuff that potentially compromises, uh, informants and gets innocent people killed, I haven't seen a single instance of that actually happening, but that argument has been made. And when that is done, I'm not okay with it. That is wrong to put innocent people in harm's way. You're releasing information that should not be in the public eye, but it's advocate to note that you've done that. Right. But that's the thing. He has not done that as far as I know. Uh, in terms of releasing that video of innocent people being gunned down and children being shot full of lead, uh, that video. And then this thing about trap wire, I think these are things that are in the public interest very much so. I like to know that all of these new surveillance cameras going up in towns and cities because there are a lot of them now that we're not there a couple of years ago that many of these could be plugged into trap wire that's useful public information.

Speaker 6:          02:53:31       That's what the media used to do. And a previous generation, it would be like Walter Cronkite or Edward Murrow telling you about this. It would not be Julian Assange on his little, on his wikileaks form, you know. So, uh, I think in some regards what he's doing is at the forefront of journalism. And it's funny you brought up the specific charge that Sweden is trying to get them on a, because I've said stuff on Twitter before. I've said like what I just said no about how, I think that's journalism. You put something out there that's tremendously important to the public and that is being covered up and not known. That's journalism. And somebody said, why are you defending a rapist like Julian Assange? And I said, first of all, that's not even the charge. He's not being charged with rape. So get your facts straight. And second of all, since when does a alleging that somebody did something, that means they're automatically guilty. It doesn't matter that there's, you know, tremendous pressure being placed on them to nail this guy on something. It's so transparent. It's so big. It was so obvious that it's something else. And then going after him from that wall in Sweden is weird. Like, I don't think there's an analog of that in the u s it'd be like, uh, it just, it doesn't make sense.

Speaker 2:          02:54:36       It's not right. It's not what did it, it's craziness that there, if the race did so much resources to try to drag him out of the country like this, it's terrifying. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:54:46       Well they're doing it. To make an example and then talking about storming the Ecuadorian embassy, you make an example out of him. Nobody else is going to have the balls to create a wiki leaks too. It's done. Isn't that an act of war? If they enjoy it and it ends the whole diplomatic system, the whole system of embassies, which is pretty important stuff. Otherwise,

Speaker 1:          02:55:04       if we don't have that, then we're just a bunch of animals, just different countries battling for resources at all times. And you have no ground rules. I mean an embassy is a pretty sacred thing. So disturbing. And so part of our reality, man, I can only hope that with guys like you running for Congress and with this young generation that's coming up, and this is one of the things that I've said is that I don't think you're going to change these creepy old vampire dudes that are running banks. I think they are fucking set in their ways and they're a bunch of old douchebags and our only hope is the upcoming generation. Guys like you, it's time for, it's time for everybody to step up who wants to these mid twenties motherfuckers with uh, uh, uh, a dedication to change. And uh, so thanks for doing what you're doing, man.

Speaker 1:          02:55:49       And anytime you wanna come on the podcast, we'd be more than happy to. Thanks. Having me on is an awesome show. I'm not just saying that. It's like the only place where you can talk about stuff like this for hours. I go about to explode from the, from the urine and my bladder. But uh, that's great. Like nothing else does that. Like you get right into something important, then they cut you off and that's it because everybody's so add that that's all you get. Well, I think that we've been tricked into thinking that that's the only way people will pay attention. That you have to give them this little quick sound bites and then quit. We is Kim Kardashians getting up and asked. It's too big. You'll be the judge. We'll be right back. Yeah, we, we were so like we were so like distracted. But there's a lot of people that are realizing that podcasts and things like this, these conversations, it's, it's an opportunity to get a really be involved really in your own ear buds, you know, to, to be considering both sides and, and maybe your own opinion.

Speaker 1:          02:56:42       It doesn't even get expressed that you want to express to me on Twitter later or whatever. But to be a part of a conversation between two people talking about something that you think is really important or you think is really interesting and that didn't exist before because we had too many fucking people that were telling people what isn't. It is an interesting, instead of just doing it naturally, right? So anytime you want to come back on it, man, we'd be more than happy. All right. It sounds out. Sounds awesome. Florida. Respect David Seaman and the fucking house. How can they vote for you? When, when, where are you out of? I am in Florida. His 20th district.
