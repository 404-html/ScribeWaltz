Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Like midnight express. God Damn, it's been so long. It's a in through the nose, out through the mouth and it's a lot of belly breathing. It's all about the diaphragm. You got to go Hixon Gracie

Speaker 2:          00:00:19       second. I can't

Speaker 1:          00:00:20       really do that. His son would you like to get a cron can do it too. Yeah, it's bad ass. I saw a video of him do it online. Does it just like his father. It's pretty freaky. Yeah, it's pretty awesome. I'd watch just anybody. Meanwhile I've lacked the discipline to get that far down the road and the breathing probably on a yoga. Yeah, that's what it is or Marillo talking about it. It's deep shit man. And um, you know, we had a, my friend Aubrey was on the other day and he was talking about shamonic breathing, which they do intense bursts of in through the nose, out through the mouth, into the nose, out the mouth. And if you do it for like 10 15 minutes, apparently you reached this like crazy, lucid, euphoric state. Sorry. Oxygenated your blood or whatever. Very strange psychedelic experience apparently. Yeah, that's right.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       You dirty fucks. This podcast is brought to you by [inaudible] dot com go to o, n n I t use a code name, Rogan and save yourself 10% off any and all supplements. We just added a new item. It's called a t plus. It's a testosterone supplement. Yeah, there's a lot of fuckery in the world of testosterone supplements. So we looked into it for a long time to try to find out is there an effective blend of nutrients that can increase your testosterone? Because there's a lot of different things that are out there on the market that may or may not work. And the only thing that we could find for sure that worked is all the stuff that we put into this t plus formula. I'm, one of them is magnesium disparic acid, which has been shown in at least one study to increase free testosterone by 42%.

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       Um, there's the, there's magnesium and the zinc Zma. Yeah. You know, I read into that Zma and one of the things that it seems to increase testosterone, it just being completely honest about it. I, and I, I take the product, um, they say that the way can help you is that it can give you deep sleep and if you are lacking in zinc, then it can make up for that. And boost testosterone is in people who are lacking in zinc. But apparently zinc is just like really essential. So a that just shows me that, um, zinc is, it's a very important aspect of normal health to keep you functioning, but it don't, I don't know if it necessarily raises your testosterone. It's, it seems to only raise it and people who are lacking in sync. Um, uh, I was saying you suna [inaudible] um, uh, elevates your natural, I know I fucked that up.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       Elevates your natural dopamine levels, which is a key neurotransmitter involved in hormone hormone synthesis. And we got this stuff called Long Jack. It's like Euro Como long if Phila and helps your body enhanced the synthesis of various androgens produced by the testes, which is your sac, Aka your nuts son. Um, so what we did is we just, we formulated all of this shit that we could put together that work in a synergistic fashion to, uh, to help elevate your body's testosterone. The good thing about this is that this is not something that your body would become dependent upon and also that it doesn't impede your natural production of testosterone. One of the issues with, um, if you take a testosterone replacement, like I take a testosterone cream and I rub it on. And when you do, the problem with doing that is if you do too much, if you have too much of it, like if you get crazy, like there's an issue with MMA fighters where, um, they're on testosterone replacement therapy.

Speaker 1:          00:03:34       Okay. And the, the real issue is, okay, well why are they lacking in testosterone or they're lacking testosterone cause they did steroids and then they're nuts. Shutdown because that's what happens when you do steroids and not shut down. Then you can go to the doctor and the doctor says, oh, well you're low on testosterone and you look at them and you go, wait a minute, what the fuck is going on here? This guy's a gorilla and he's low on testosterone. What is happening here? So there's that. And then there's also people that start to get older. Like myself, I'm 45 years old. At a certain point in time, your body is just not going to produce the same level of hormones is before. And there's two ways about it. You know, you can either add testosterone to your system or do something like this stuff. I have not started this, but I'm going to start trying this.

Speaker 1:          00:04:14       Um, this isn't Zma. This is something completely different. Well, it does have some magnesium in it, but it has magnesium aspartic acid, which has been shown in actual clinical studies. It's the key ingredient and Zma. But it's been shown in clinical studies that it actually can this one particular aspect of it. So will this still do the frothy loads? I believe your loads will stay frothy long. Jack also builds up frothy loads, long jack or something that people have been using. It's a, some of the root or some shit it's people have been using for a long time to, to boost testosterone. So, um, we're the pee wee, we Beta test this on people. They've had great results and we're super excited about it. So we think that a, there's something to it. We think that this is a, um, uh, a supplement that the most important thing is that it doesn't fuck with your body's natural ability to produce testosterone, which the shit that I'm on does, my balls would shut down.

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       Basically. I said done. I don't know. He's not really because I don't take that much of it. I take a gram, it's like a what you would put on a tube of toothpaste and I rub it on, sort of know my shoulders, shoulders, and your upper chest, excuse me, a little bit of test. Not too much, but, but a lot of guys like I don't want to be like this guy. I got my wife pregnant twice while on it, but, so that means my boss still work. But I know a lot of dudes, they're balls don't work anymore. They're done. You know, and there's some shit you can take like Hcg, I believe. Yeah. You can build your level of juvenile. Yeah. But it takes time. Well, what this is, yeah, this, this, this video which you're looking at right now is ridiculous and was more ridiculous until I stepped in because at the end of the video, there's, and thank you to the rogue and board and all my freaks in the rogue and board.

Speaker 1:          00:05:45       Uh, and I forgot which individual pointed it out. I forgive me, but it's actually in the current farm. This was, which is the current farmers, my area fruit problem. Yeah. Well the video is like, he's getting a stretch on and then he lifts and then afterwards he was at the bar with these chicks and they were pointing about how cheesy it was. And I was like, oh my God. No, because I always shit on this Stephen Dorff commercial where he's smoking cigarettes, by the way. This is in black and white, which again, makes it extra douchey. That does make it extra duty. She, oh, go ahead and start your, here's your, here's your car, your queer. Um, the, uh, the video at the end was him at the bar with two chicks and the music's horrible. And I'm like, oh my God, stop. It was way worse than Stephen Dorff commercial. And it was like, I can't be involved in this.

Speaker 1:          00:06:35       We also had to remove the word swagger. Someone also pointed out your, yeah, the word swagger was involved. Exactly. I was like, Jesus Christ, you're selling whenever you're involved in anything enhancing like anything, a male enhancing, you have to really try hard to avoid the stigma of Douchey lists. Cause it's so easy to catch, so easy to catch. It's like, well, it's like being in a daycare and not getting sick. You're in a situation where you know, you gotta you gotta you gotta be real careful on that. Exactly. Anyway, plenty of shit to buy it on a.com. It's essentially a performance enhancing website and that's really what it is. All legal stuff. But it's all about Alpha brain, which, uh, I take for every podcast. I take four of these for every podcast. I take four of them before every UFC. I take four of them before comedy shows.

Speaker 1:          00:07:24       Um, it's, it's, these are essential building blocks for human neurotransmitters and it can enhance the way your mind functions. For me, it's an essential, you know, I've heard people say, oh, I don't feel anything on, I mean, you might not, I don't know how your body works. Everybody's body's completely different. People have different responses to alcohol. People have different responses to foods and allergies. And for me, it's a must have. Um, I'm, I'm a huge believer in nootropics. I've been a fan of him long before I ever got involved in Alpha brain. I took a bill Romanowski stuff, which is called neuro one. And Bill Romanowski created it because he was having real issues with massive headaches and head problems after all the concussions that he took playing football. So he got involved in, uh, nutrients, um, to, uh, to make his mind healthier. And, uh, I took some of his stuff, found out about no name, remember no name from Alison, known name, Sarah known him in San Francisco.

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       And from there I really got interested and started just experimenting with various different combinations of them. And this is the best one so far from me. Go to [inaudible] dot com use the code name Brogan, save 10% and go fuck yourself. Holla. We're also a sponsored by Squarespace. Now this is, this is the newest sponsor that we've got.

It's, it allows you to make your own websites without being like a red band, like a computer genius.

Speaker 3:          00:09:04       I've actually thought about using coder guys just because it seems the way to go nowadays. Yeah. Like I don't feel like doing all the old stuff anymore.

I can't wait to get into the Rogan version. The Rogan questions hit it.

Speaker 4:          00:13:13       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:13:22       yes, either. I'll never do that. Yeah, you can't. It's very important part of the critical, we're back from a week vacation. Sorry for everybody that got the Jones. I appreciate it. I appreciate all the tweets and the messages and everything we had, but we had to take some time off. Shit was getting, getting a little stale, get a little crazy, fresh it up. During my time off, I was reading the disaster diaries. It was um, it's really speaks to like how I view the world and uh, excellent. Very, I mean it was like you were like inside my head with so many different aspects of the idea of, of disasters, the idea of taking care of your kids and that, that extra feeling of vulnerability that you have now being a father as opposed to the way you were when you were a young man.

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       Just you're a whatever. Fuck yeah, I'll be all right. Um, the book's called the disaster diaries, how I learned to stop worrying and love the apocalypse and uh, it's really fucking interesting stuff man. And you went, you went really deep with this. You covered so many aspects of the whole idea of survival and the whole idea of like really chaos situations and controlling your adrenaline and relaxing and how most people really have no idea that like when the shit hits the fan, most people are just literally going to like shut off, they're going to shit their pants and shut off. And that is a much more common reaction than not. Totally. Yeah. So interesting to see that. Like, you know, a lot of people know what they don't know.

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       You know what I mean? And that's, that was kind of, so one of the major, you know, sort of things I took from this book was what stress does, you know, you and I, you know, you've been in the fight game for a long time and I'd written about the fighter's mind and stuff and I was shocked at how, you know, the Cooper's color code wasn't talked about in the fight game. You know what I mean? Which, you know, it's a shooting thing. Explain to Cooper. So, so it's in the book, the Cooper's color code, which anybody who does any shooting, we'll know about it. But, but it's basically, Jeff Cooper was a very well known farms instructor in the 60s and he came up with this color code about your sort of alertness level and you know, white, you're at home kind of off or listening to music or watching TV and then yellow, you're on the street and not orange.

Speaker 5:          00:15:36       You're, you know, you sort of seeing maybe possible danger and then read you're fighting. And that was how he sort of quantified it. And then the Marine Corps later come up with black, which was the catastrophic failure of your mind, basically like the total breakdown. And it was just so interesting. They sort of, you know, I've been sort of hearing about this anecdotally and I'd seen it with fighters. Um, you know, guys freezing or just doing dumb shit over and over again. You know, it's not working, but they can't stop and they're getting punched in the face. So that's definitely not helping them there. But you know, the fact that, I mean, I'm sure some of these trainers knew about it, but nobody had mentioned, you know, there's this huge raft of data and research that's been done on, on, on stress and what it does to your body and, and, uh, it wasn't, you know, really being utilized in the fight game.

Speaker 5:          00:16:26       I think the psychological aspect of finding is one of the most overlooked aspects and it's also one of the most important. It's um, you wrote about it in the fighter's mind and there's two great books for folks, by the way, if you're a MMA fans, the fighters hard and the fighter's mind, uh, both of them are written by our friend Sam and a you actually, so people know you actually fuck yourself. And I watched that. Um, it just flipping through the channels one day I watched that video of you and the Thai camp, really a amazing video. It was really cool. It's followed you long before you were an author, right? Yeah. That was a long time ago. Yeah, it was just a kid. But yeah, it was cool. You lived in a Thai camp for like five months and uh, had, uh, how many fights did you have fought?

Speaker 5:          00:17:04       One time. And that one dude that you fought was like this fucking karate champion. He was obviously bad ass, but you out conditioned him. Yeah. Yeah. He wasn't a, he wasn't a, it wasn't shameful. The coat. Yeah, the pace and all that. He was really good though. Well he knocked me. He was good. Yeah, he was better then I was sharp. Like I remember his technique, my defense, that was my first flight of any kind. Right. You know what I mean? So like it wasn't like I had any amateur fights and you know, I had friends who fought and they couldn't even a punch. They were so nervous or they couldn't kick, they could only punch. They were like robots. You know what they got. And so, you know, yeah, I felt like shit. But you know my mind at all. You fuck great man. I did all right. But I'll listen. I chased them around with my hands down and then I went out like a, like a plank. He caught you and you watch the way

Speaker 1:          00:17:49       he caught you. That was a season fighter.

Speaker 5:          00:17:52       Yeah, he did. He definitely, he had a lot of experience. It's funny, you know Duke Roufus just tweeted me and he was like, you know, I really like that. And it's like I got a little light.

Speaker 1:          00:18:00       Well it's a great, Duke is a huge [inaudible] fan and it's a great video because it focuses on you. This guy who wants this real true Moitai immersion experience and that's one of the things that I find unique about you. One of the things I really always love to talk to you about it, it's like you're one of the rare people that I know that just you, we'll just fucking go and do something and you immerse yourself in these worlds that are like really precarious and fucking dangerous and you're, you're really into doing that. You're really into taking these chances and getting the full experience. So that's what you did in this, this Thai camp. You lived there for five months,

Speaker 5:          00:18:34       was that one? Yeah, that's six months, five, six months, something in that. And I fought at the end and then a, and then I bailed. But yeah, I mean I think I do, I do love to immerse myself and you know, I sort of kind of do like almost social anthropology. You know, I'd go get into these other subcultures. But one of the things I don't do is like, I don't really have adventures cause I feel like adventures is, you know, it's when you run out of the list, it's when you run out of gas in the desert, you know what I mean? It's like you fucked up, you fucked up and now you have an adventure now, now you're in trouble. Whereas if you plan and you, and you got your eyes and you know, you cover your basis, you don't really have adventures, you do cool shit, but it's not dangerous and you're not, you know, I think that's a semantics thing because I call those adventures. Yeah, know. Sure. It's, it is. But I think there's a, there's an important like kind of context and there's a lot of, you know, of course I think about having Tanner and I also think about, you know guys who, who, who, you know have too much faith in their strength into the wild, into the wild McCandless in that whole scene. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:31       Yeah. You got to that into the wild. Drove me crazy because I'm, this kid was supposed to be smart. Well if you're supposed to be smart, how the fuck do you not prepare for Alaska? Like you're, this is quilting

Speaker 5:          00:19:44       here. You know, the thing is he was, listen, I read the book and I've thought a lot about it and I, and I, you know, I've talked to guys about it and cause, cause I was doing all the survival stuff for disaster diary. So is that what this guy in Kansas who does survival school training for the Sayre instructors. So the guys who teach survive, evade, resist, escape school to the seals and stuff. He takes three of those guys. There are instructors and teachers in these skills. He's like, fire, fire, making Flint knapping making little trap stuff like that. Um, and we know we talked about McCandless and, and, and that guy in into the wild. And um, I think what motivated sort of the story was yeah, he was foolish, but also he made a mistake that locals make that, so he ate something that that makes you sick.

Speaker 5:          00:20:32       It looks like something you can eat. I don't think that's true. It wasn't the reality that he starved to death. Yeah, no he did. But this, this is what happened. So he got sick, but he was too close to the edge, so he was so he was, so he then he starved to death because he was so weakened at that point. So he w he didn't have the supplies and this is what Krakauer writes about and this is what, so he couldn't, he didn't have the energy to go get food basically. Yeah. Once you get, like if you're on the edge of survival and you're at the caloric kind of, you know, right at the cutoff of make, of eating enough and you're, you're in a, you're dying all the time and then you get sick, you're fucked. You know what I mean? You're in the wild and you have no one to help you.

Speaker 5:          00:21:06       So he made a mistake that should have given them diarrhea, but because he was so weak, he killed them. Oh Wow. And he starved to death because in the movie they made it out that it was something poisonous that killed him. It was, yeah, no it was, but it just makes you say, it gives you like a little intestinal diarrhea or whatever. Change that in the movie. Why, why don't they do shit like that? Sean Penn, right. I don't know, mother Fucker, Sean. Um, but the, in the, somebody, somebody told me that in the real life he had actually starved to death, but I didn't know that part. I never read the book again. I could be wrong and this is my or sort of recollection of the incident. Um, but, and, and how it went down. And I talked to this guy, um, uh, John Macpherson who does these survival stuff in Kansas and there's a lot of plants that are poisonous that looked like edible cause that's, yeah, that's kind of the nature of edible plants.

Speaker 5:          00:21:51       And sometimes they, you know, the other plants disguise themselves, whatever. You know what I mean? There's this, so you can make that mistake pretty easily, I guess. Yeah. There's a group of old people that live in an old folks home and one of the ladies went out and pick mushrooms and this bitch can't see anymore. So she got all these poisoned mushrooms, cooked them up for everybody and they all died. Wow. Punch of in China, I think it was American man. I don't think it was a Florida or some shit. Yeah, no. And what his point was is like, you know, if he's trying to survive, you're trapping animals and eating the whole animal. Yeah. Which was kind of interesting. Getting your nutrients from like eating the brain and eating right, eating, you know, all the work. He didn't know how to prepare the food. And he didn't also know. He didn't know how to keep it. Like he fucked up the Mousse. That's what I asked him about. Actually it's in the book I asked Macpherson about, you know, what you do with, you know, cause he in, in into the wild, he kills a moose and he doesn't know what to do with it. He tries to dry it but flies.

Speaker 5:          00:22:47       But if you cut it just thin enough, so all it is is you cut strips of in, you need a sharp knife, you cut strips. As long as it's under a half inch or a quarter inch, it's in the book, but it's like a thick, so it's thin sheets and you're hanging out to dry and you get some sun. The flies won't lay eggs in it and it turns into Jerky Dude. Yeah, they do that in Mexico. Yeah. Buffalo. They take these strips. It's this weird technique that I saw on Steve Rinella. Shell [inaudible] he takes these, they take these strips of meat and they hang them over a line in the hot sun. Right. Then they take them and they smashed them up. Right. And then they re they put water in it and they cook it and it's called the Chaka. Right. Well this is just the preserve to make jerky.

Speaker 5:          00:23:33       All you do is dry it and it's really not very edible, but it's me. It'll keep you alive. And it's, yeah, it's uh, it's, I didn't know Turkey was that simple. Like, you know, you sort of think there's something complicated and they put a lot of spices and you buy it. But um, yeah, you just dry it. And uh, it's interesting that it's cooked meat is more dangerous. Raw meats not that dangerous for some reason. You know, he gets cooked meat, like the Salmonella gets in it and you die from that shit or whatever. But Raleigh, yeah. This, these guys would go out and they would have a big hunk of raw meat and they would hang it under a tree with a wet towel wrapped around it and leave it for the week. And that was their fridge. And they would just carve off pieces.

Speaker 5:          00:24:11       They cooked the pieces, you know, so once you, once you heat it up, but it wouldn't, how rotten was it? I don't think it was that bad. And where was this? What part of they weren't Kansas. Jesus Christ. Fucking crazy. I know. It's weird shit. But you know, it's like, it keeps it a little cool. And then I, I didn't do that. I didn't do that. But that's what he, that's what I saw them week in Kansas. And what is the temperature is in November. He knows summertime, summertime. So they were hunting out of season these mother fuckers, is that what they're doing? He might've been, or the mother had like, you know, they might've had this roadkill or something. It might not have been somewhere. It might've been fall. I don't know. I don't know. It was something he had done with some guys then they live primitive. So they didn't have any, uh, steel tool.

Speaker 6:          00:24:49       I would imagine you could do that. I mean, when I went to your hunting, we hung the deer's outside for like a couple of days, but it was only 12 degrees outside. Right. It's like you didn't have to worry about it, but the, the idea of like a Kansas summer.

Speaker 5:          00:25:02       Yeah. Fucking deer leg with a towel wrapped around it. It's like the jungle

Speaker 6:          00:25:09       that can be good for you. Right. They see that I'm the most important things to cook or things that eat meat like bears and pigs like bear. The kidney can kill you apparently like the kid. He's like soup. I think so. Really? There's something in a bear. You, you cannot eat. It's poison. Hmm. It'll actually kill you dead. Ooh. And it's edible and like herbivores. Well yeah, you can eat kidneys and other things and you should eat them in other things and a or live or maybe it's liver. I Dunno. There's something that a bear you can't eat. Hunger would make sense. Yeah. It's the liver. Well, if they, I'm livers like bears like some bears there, they eat a lot of garbage too. Like you gotta be real careful. Apparently in New Jersey they just started allowing people to hunt black bears because they have so many black bears that are like rating garbages and getting in the streets and stuff like that.

Speaker 6:          00:25:52       But the issue is if you get a bear that's been eating garbage, it's going to taste like shit. Yeah. So you're shooting this thing and it's, you know, you're not even going to eat it. You know what, I'm going to enjoy it. Well, like the deer in Kansas there, they're basically grain fed cattle because they're eating the grains and the cattle are eating and stuff. So they have all the cattle issues and it's not like, oh, that's true. Yeah, and big and fat. But they're, you know, it's not like great deer meat. Oh, that's right. I didn't even think of that. Apparently a Alfalfa, it's like one of the best foods for the year. And then eat Alfalfa though, like super healthy. It's like people will grow a whole field of Alfalfa because just to make sure the deer come in Alfalfa, like there's these gray areas, these places called high fence operations. They set it up. So they kind of like, Ted Nugent has one, only trap all these deer and like whatever. He's gotten, Michigan, he's got one in Michigan and one Texas. She's got like in Texas, I know he has 300 acres. I don't know what he has. It's like shooting fish in a barrel kind of. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       But you know you have like a certain amount of space and they're in there. Yeah. You know, and they're eating Alfalfa. So it's like on one hand it's a smart move here on a prime for the apocalypse. Yeah. I mean if you have a setup like that and you're planning for the apocalypse, that's pretty dope. Cause apparently mean, think about a deer. You could eat a deer for a long ass time. You shoot one day or you're good for like a month, right of every day. So if you have like a whole property filled with them, that would be good.

Speaker 5:          00:27:11       No, I mean there's a lot of like ideal situations and that was kind of the, one of the scary things about this book was like not having the bunker. Right. And and or do I build a bunker or where do I build the bunker but do it in Montana. Wait all the minute man, sites from Montana. And I think what I got into really was that Black Swan issue, which is you just don't know what the disaster is going to be. You don't know if it's going to be x, y, or Z. And until you do the bunker could be a danger. It can be a crutch because you depend on the bunker. It's like you're mentally hooked to this bunker because you put so much time and money into it. You're not ready to leave when it's time to

Speaker 1:          00:27:46       go. I think one of the most important things that you emphasize in this book is just preparing your physical body and not just by getting in shape, but by understanding stress and by putting yourself in stressful situations and making yourself sort of recover and, and, and, and, and handle that. The inoculation to stress idea. That was a really interesting point that you brought up.

Speaker 5:          00:28:07       Yeah. I mean, that's what, you know, again, the military, you know, and even sports psychology is about, you know, sports psychology. It's just much lower levels of stress cause you're not scared you're going to die. Um, but in an MMA fight, fighting Anderson Silva, you might read it as though you're still, you know, I have some of this condition black, if you're in Rio and you're fighting habits, right? The black right,

Speaker 1:          00:28:29       they have that. They have that chance. I don't know what they're saying, but apparently saying you're going to die calling for blood and they're all yelling out, you're going to die in Portuguese. It's like, Ooh, Ooh. They do all fucking these 18,000 of them, the screen. And then you're looking across the octagon and Anderson Silva's there. You might think you're going, I might have her passion black reaction. Yeah. And we went into that a little bit, but explaining to people that condition black is when your heart rate and everything gets to a point where you're, your adrenaline is too high and you can't think rationally.

Speaker 5:          00:29:01       So your, your Amygdala, which recognizes a these things subconsciously or consciously. But you see a threat and your body of course does fight or flight right and boom fills your, you know, your body with adrenaline and other chemicals and you're, you know, everything changed. Everything changes. So your, your, your eyeball actually changes shape and your fine motor skills really sell for because you know, your muscles will fill up and you can have, you know, trouble tying things. There was a, you know, Navy Seals, they were at the end of a really rugged course. They were trying to um, uh, they had to handcuff these, you know, what the plastic zip ties these, these, these other trainees and the guys who had pre threaded, it had no problem. The who hadn't spent minutes trying to, cause even though they're navy seals and they're bad ass, like they, it was just there were so filled with adrenaline. It made it so hard for them to even get that, the thread, that little,

Speaker 1:          00:29:52       well, the proper, you know, also gross movements when you tax out those muscles. Yes. It very hard to operate everything. More skill.

Speaker 5:          00:29:59       Totally. And then your, your cognitive ability gets sit down and you know, I always think of what Brian's story about. He got mugged and he dialed a four one one right over and over. Yeah, because I was trying to call nine one one you know, it's so like shaky that couldn't, like my fingers wouldn't work. I'm sitting there staring at my phone like, why is this not chick? Why is it, what am I doing right? It's actually really common, which is the paramedics. They'll say that if it's a loved one that's a hurt and you're losing your mind. A lot of people will die cap to get the neighbor to call nine one one because they can't actually operate the phone. So you think, oh, I'll be all right. You know? But truth is like people get so fucked up, they can't operate phone, they can't dial nine one which is you think would be impossible, but it does happen.

Speaker 1:          00:30:43       We are weird animal in the fact that we're, we're conscious. Yeah. So you're kind of aware of all these things that are happening and you're not just operating on instinct. Like basically every other animal on this whole planet is just operating purely on instincts. We are aware of scenarios that have taken place before and the possible repercussions for those scenarios or those all roll around in our mind, a sea of possibilities and then it can shut you down. And then the whole not having experience with stress, we're not, and that's what animals

Speaker 5:          00:31:13       diffuses, you know that. So the two ways you can do it, our training, which is like military, you repeated a million times or sports, you'd do it a million times. So even when you're stressed out of your mind, you still can do it.

Speaker 1:          00:31:23       Yeah. Where are your, your movement is a natural move on instead of the contract,

Speaker 5:          00:31:27       securely ingrained and you've very efficient, you know, nurse, some nap tickly or whatever and all that stuff. Or you can, you know, have experience and that's the inoculation against stress, which if you've been through similar things, you know, this isn't going to kill you. You know, I always think about how important it is for fighters and fatigue. Uh, when they get so exhausted and you, you know, the lactic acid is filling their body and you know this, cause you, you roll and you and you fight and all that, but it's like you feel like you're gonna

Speaker 1:          00:31:56       die. Yeah. You really looking for a way out.

Speaker 5:          00:31:58       And if you, as long as you know your, if you've been through it a few times, you know, hey, I'm not going to die. That feeling that I want to die does not mean that I am going to die. And so I can keep going and rest. That's why wrestlers are so good at them and may because they, they're, they're mentally so ready for that fatigue. And that's all wrestling really is, you know, is, is managing that fatigue and managing that push. So, um,

Speaker 1:          00:32:21       and then also the exhaustion that they get from dehydration, that fatigue is the mental toughness comes from that. Do you know about this thing where they're going to remove wrestling for the weapon? Is that the nuttiest fucking,

Speaker 5:          00:32:33       yeah, it seems like it's all real political. And just, you know, feel a fucked up. But it's also like the, I dunno, sees a mess by the way. I mean, oh yeah. Well because you know racist, they were like, there's like a real neo Nazi background. The Olympic, the Olympic Games. Really? Yeah. If you look at who ran it, that's, so you don't have that, that famous picture in the 60s of those guys. The black power salute. You know they're wearing gloves. Yes. Cause they didn't want their skin to touch the hand of once they metaled of the guy who was handing out the medals because he was an affirmed neo Nazi. Wow. So he told them to put gloves he wore, they wore gloves because they didn't want to touch his skin. That's why they're wearing gloves. Yeah. The guys in the sixth, it's like one of them was Austrian and if I forget the exact thing, but it was like one of them, the forties and then his successor in the 60s were like, had these real like Neo Nazi sympathies is shit. So the Olympics has like some shading, this dirty business.

Speaker 1:          00:33:26       It's up there. I'm, I'm real vague about this, but wasn't there like almost everything else, but wasn't there a thing about a couple of years ago where there was a big scandal briberies and a bunch of things in the IOC? I'm sure there was some sort of scandal.

Speaker 5:          00:33:41       Know what I mean? It's all, it's, it's a pretty, it's, it always ends up ruining the city, costing them kajillion dollars and who knows where the money goes to developing and

Speaker 1:          00:33:50       it bothers me also that the athletes don't get money. That just seems crazy. The idea of that, not giving them some sort of a financial prize. W where's all that money going? It's what they're getting an opportunity. They are your number one thing that you're selling. Number one, you're saying thing you're selling is the performance of the athletes. That's number one and you're making billions and they don't get any. That's fucking crazy. I don't care what you call it, amateur, but it's amateur. It's amateur. That sounds like slavery. It sounds like an onsite, I feel the same way about the NCAA and football [inaudible] they're making so much money and the athletes are getting compensated college athletes crazy. I mean this is crazy, but it's like that doesn't, you know, the idea is that it's up through and around. Yeah, it's a proving ground and it launches them into the net and the ideal also, I think I get a little bit more with the Ncaa because they should be concentrating on their education and this is a side aspect of it and that education is building towards, but I think that the idea that the school just profits completely off of it.

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       It goes to maybe the money should go to programs, maybe all the profits that should go to the athletes and instead go to pro. I mean imagine how rich those schools would be and their ability to go after school dungeons and dragons, baroque music programs and kind of make it to pick it. Right? They should get to pick which, helping their community out. Think about the amount of money that the NCAA, you know, creates and think about how much benefit that could be for any community. If they took like a sizeable chunk, like 50% like what are the, what are like hockey players just bargain for 50% and so it was, they had more somewhere else.

Speaker 5:          00:35:31       The NBA, all the, you know, the unions.

Speaker 1:          00:35:33       Imagine if the NCAA football guys got 50% like people don't realize how much

Speaker 6:          00:35:38       money is in college sports. I didn't realize it until Joey Lane. Shocking. Like the Penn state thing. This sex scandal made no sense to me. I was like, how did this not get outed? That's crazy. Who would, and then I found out how much money you can state makes every year from their football program and from getting donations. It's in the billions. Yeah. What the alumni, the spa. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's insane. And when you get that high, you're going to get people that are doing whatever they can to keep that thing. That way, if that, if that amount of money, half of it like was just like, okay, these guys, essentially they're professionals. But instead of giving them the money, we're going to give it to the community thought yeah, that'd be me. And it would grow. Keep those fat cons from getting fatter. Those motherfuckers, but rich pitches out there just stealing from these young urban kids with good legs.

Speaker 6:          00:36:28       That's right. Handsome kids fuckers. They're given him a shot. I mean I, I get that, but somebody, I don't know. Yeah. I still feel like, you know the injury rate and all that stuff, you know. Oh that's true too. What was that one young guy who was like a real promising football player. Just blue. It's just at any moment man. And then one with the hand of God can come and just no more for you. The circles your whole life actually the hand a probability, right? Yeah. Cause it's such a dangerous occupationally running into people, full black running super athletes at each other, like a gladiator moving. Right. It's like, it's also what you're paying for is that sort of what people want to see. And, um, this, one of the other things about your book, about the Color Code that freaked me out was the stories of cops with their gun on safety with their tendons exploded in their fingers, shot dead because they're gun was on safety and they kept squeezing the trigger, but nothing was happening.

Speaker 5:          00:37:21       Video of a, of a cop who is just saying drop the weapon, drop the weapon. And he's what they call a stuck on the behavioral loop. So that's condition black. So when you get so stressed out that your heart rate is, you know, very, very high, 175 beats per minute or whatever it is, it's, it's, you have what they called dissociation. So you start having perceptual issues like time moves slowly. You don't hear things, you don't see things. A tunnel vision, like the gun, all you can see is the barrel of the gun, right or whatever. And you get behavioral looping. Like people do the same thing over and over again. So like, you know, they're stuck in the, in the nightclub and they're trying to open the door. Right. Door is locked, but they stayed there for 10 minutes because that's it. That's their only thing.

Speaker 5:          00:38:00       Or the cops are pulling their, you know, pull and trying to find, work their weapon. Or is there's a video of this cop yelling, drop the weapon, drop the weapon, drop the weapon, and then the guys reloading, oh and drop the weapon. And then he shoots the cop and he couldn't get out of that loop. And again, what's interesting about it is it makes sense if you're, if we're cavemen, like if there's a wolf, you know, chewing on my arm and I'm losing my mind, I'm like, just keep hitting them with a rock like this. You've got to just keep doing that. Like that's, that's your survival. That's, that's it. That's my best plant, you know? Right. But in the modern world where you have a need for critical thinking, you know, you need like, you know, even this guy's in the, in the nightclub fire and in Brazil recently, uh, some of those guys were, were Facebook and me and talking about what, what worked and what didn't work and how they got out.

Speaker 5:          00:38:47       And you know, the guys and a lot of them didn't, you know, it was, it was, there wasn't a way out, but hundreds of people, right? Yeah. And it's terrible. But you know, I'm not like an next, I didn't really study it in depth, but again, the critical thinking. So finding ways out, finding, you know, thinking, being able to step back and go, oh, there's another exit in the kitchen. There's always an exit in the kitchen, you know, and, and uh, and get getting to it is, is the trick. And you know, when you're in condition black, you can't get there. You know, you can't, that's the whole problem is like, you can't think of it. You know, you can't see yourself clearly enough. And this is the thing that, you know, that people do call it combat breathing, where they take, you know, four deep breaths on a four count, which is great if you can think to do it, you know what I mean? But again, the problem is you don't know you're in condition black when you're in conditioned black, right. And it's this, it's Nick's up on you

Speaker 1:          00:39:36       in the inevitability of our demise is in the back of our head and when all of a sudden you're confronted by it, like gets here. Yeah. It becomes exponentially more stressful than it is for an animal because even though an animal instinctively knows it's got to get the fuck away from you, I don't think they can really calculating, quantify all the possibilities. And when we do, it's like it's paralysis by analysis. It's the adrenaline dump and the heart rate. What does the heart rate when you're in condition black?

Speaker 5:          00:40:05       It depends. You know, it's, it's very, it's all specific to the person, but you know, 175 so it's like one whole sprinting. Yeah. And it's not from exercise at all. So it's just from adrenaline. There's actually a, which makes it really hard to breathe. There's this thing called the V, so Vega vagal response, and you know, the Vegas is a nerve, but the way it was put to me, which I thought was great was it's a, it's a, it's in the book, Dude. I, I, it's like, it's myelinated nerve colonnade and response. So it's a polyvagal theory illegal basically like this a Reptilian reptilian part of your brain. Right? You know, we all know that and there's two kinds of Vegas that, that operate possibly and, and uh, one is Reptilian, one has mammalians rights, but if the reptilian one gets into it, that can slow you down and make you freeze and the Mammalian one wants you to run, run, run, run, run. Right? So it's like stepping on the gas pedal and the brake at the same time as hard as you can. And that's what condition black is. You think about doing that in your car, getting your car and just jumping on the gas and the brake as hard as you can.

Speaker 1:          00:41:06       That happens that people panic in automobile accidents as well. Yeah. People think they're hitting the brake and the hitting the gas,

Speaker 5:          00:41:13       I've hit the brake by accident when you're hitting, you know what I mean? Like, Oh shit. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:41:19       Yeah. They were right next door. I really fucking close the, the, the modern life we live is so soft. It's so easy, the ability to go to Jack in the box and feed your fat face while you're still in your, which

Speaker 6:          00:41:34       you, you know, you didn't build that car, you didn't design it. And how it works. Easy job at an easy place where you're not stressing at all during the day. You're just doing whatever the fuck you gotta do, Sell Insurance, whatever it is. I mean, whatever normal stress you have from sending in a normal office, but your body literally is never taxed. If you're the average person that doesn't exercise, you've reached a level of the human animal has reached a level that doesn't exist in nature and animal that can't survive on its own, attached symbiotically cultural since two hour two. Well you can't make it.

Speaker 6:          00:42:15       Even a dog can fucking go out there and kill rat a rat. You know, what are you going to do? Yeah, well most of them. And I think the, what I realized because I did that, so I was getting ready for the end of the world in various scenarios. And I did work outs and uh, you know, I, I, you know, did a bunch of different stuff. But one of the important things about fitness is, is it keeps your mind ready for the disaster you can handle and adrenaline better if you're in good shape. You know, and if you've gotten your sleep, you know, it, a lot of those breakdowns happen when people are sleep deprived. So, you know, you read about people that have had panic attacks and a lot of it comes after they have insomnia for a long time, you know, sleep, you know, not getting your sleep is huge.

Speaker 6:          00:42:58       All that shit. Yeah. What a strange animal. You know, the fact that we need to shut off every night. Well they were kind of, most of them do. Right. But what a weird property of our existence that we have to shut off the world is so stressful. You have to spend a third of it not paying attention and that, and we don't even exactly know why you need to do it. I mean we're, we're so confused on what exactly is going on during rem sleep and we know you the aspects, we know hormones Murray. And the real issue is the psychedelic drugs that your brain releases while you're sleeping. That's when things get really fucked up and you're like, what is going on when you're dreaming? And what happens to people who don't get the dream ended up having psychotic breakdown? They get crazy. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:43:38       When they've done studies where they've kept people awake for days at a time, like people literally lose their shifts. They kind of breakdown. Yeah. That'd become psychos. 48 hours, 72 matches being tired like your mind just delusion. Yeah. Fuck out. It just doesn't function right. It's very, very odd. Yeah. It's interesting cause a lot of this stuff like they are doing a lot more science of fear now, right. So they're like, they're putting electrode caps on people and chucking them out of airplanes and sort of so they can really sort of see what's happening. So there's some interesting new books, like extreme fear. Jeff Wise's book is pretty cool. Like it's about what, even a jumping out of an airplane. It's sort of a controlled situation. Like yeah, you're shitting your pants, cause your pair of shooting, but you're not fighting Anderson Silva. You're not, you know, you're not in a car accident and it's not, you know, it's not like the building's on fire. It's your, what I love about what I was like about MMA and stuff does he, you get to train for it and

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       you know, nobody's going to hit you behind the head with a two by four. You know what I mean? It's like you get ready. Yeah. And we're, I always worried about myself was like, what if I'm not ready? Yeah. And I'm just driving home and the shit hits the fan and I'm like, uh, you know, how long would it take me to adjust my reality to this new reality? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:49       Being prepared is such a relief. It's a relief thing too. It relieves stress. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:44:56       well that's where I want it to go. You know what I realized was like, I don't want to be paranoid and be a doomsday prepper because I think sometimes that then ends up being a counter productive. Like you, you know the anxiety is making you less relaxed. Right? You're more worried, you're more fearful of your neighbors and you're more convinced of like, I got to shoot everybody. Know what I mean? People. Yeah. That way they're going to, they're ready to go. You know, they got their guns and they were ready to go. There's a lot of those folks, they're just ready to rock and roll. When Kev large grocery store, well you know, one strapped to the rank one their belt one to their body, you know, anyone fighting, they always say be first, right? Like maxing be first. And that's why I ended the book with don't be first like don't be the fucking guy who starts shooting right away.

Speaker 5:          00:45:43       You know what I mean? Because you don't want to, don't want to be that guy. Like, that's not the smart move and a, that's not the best one for survival because people need each other like primates in the wilderness band together. Right? Like the best thing, the best survival team you can have, the best is it is a team of experts, right? It is the best thing to have in your go bag is a doctor, a mechanic, and a soldier. Right. You know, it's like you're not going to do all those things yourself. Right. So anyway, that was kind of where I took it, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:46:12       that is though it was so important. And that was a, also part of, into the wilds, he said, he was saying that all this beautiful wilderness that he came to love really, he couldn't enjoy it without people. Right. You know, it's one of the, I forgot that part. Yeah. And that was very profound to me because I, I, um, make a lot, I have like a little, a bit of a dance between too many people and not enough people. You know, I go, one of the things I loved about living in Colorado was that it was like super quiet rural and I could be around like virtually no one and just chill and relax. But I don't know if I'd like that all the time. I think I liked that because I'm always dealing with

Speaker 5:          00:46:49       yes crowds. No, I love to spend half the day of myself, but I think yeah, if I, I've never gone a long time. Like I've never gone more than four or five days without seeing people and I think I would lose my shit. I think I'd get pretty bummed.

Speaker 1:          00:47:03       I think you can easily, are you familiar with the vice.com? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No vice guide to travel. You're a senior. They have to do's and don'ts. The fashion do's and don'ts device does, but they have a lot of different cool things airline. But one of them they had was a hind Moe's, uh, Arctic, I think it's called Heimos Arctic adventure. And it's a guy named Hein Mo and he lives up in the northeast of Alaska.

Speaker 6:          00:47:30       He's like one of the last people that's allowed to like keep a cabin up there. And it was sort of like a homesteader group situation grandfathered in and yeah, and this guy's been up there for, since like the 1970s. It's a really fascinating, and they had these dudes from vice magazine went up there and lived with this guy for a week and got to see him shoot a bear that was intruding in their, cause he's hanging these Caribou out in front of his camp, but occasionally a bear will coming to campus, a bear ate his dog alive. I was attached to a chain, like really dark dark shit. And so he's out there. Yeah. While he's there, while they're there, the guy goes out and has to shoot this bear. And like in the middle of the night it's really fucked up. Like you hear him running, you hear guns going off, you hear the bear moaning.

Speaker 6:          00:48:12       It's like really kind of fucked up. Cause his grizzly had founded staff once a Grizzly, fine, they're going to come for you. Um, but he was up there at one point in time. He said, I think for eight months by himself and he was like, I will never do that again. It's like that's, that was too much. That was too crazy. You have those solo sailors get into that. They spend six months at sea by themselves and must fuck you. Get on it down. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You must be just so happy to communicate with anybody. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't, I wouldn't want to try it. Um, and you know, now that I have a wife and kid too, it's like, you know, I can't, I'm like so codependent. It's retarded. Well that's one of the interesting things about your book is that you and I are sort of very similar in that way that you're, I don't want to say I felt invulnerable cause I was always aware of my mortality, but I didn't worry about it nearly as much as I started to, once you started having children and in your case you waited until your kid was like fate, basically acceptable age.

Speaker 6:          00:49:08       Like okay, I'm going to the Amazon for a little while. I'm like, wow. Like, that must've been quite a mind fuck to be in that state of mind where you know, you now have this baby, that incredible love for your wife. It's incredible lover, her and this manly need to take care of everything and then all of a sudden you're in the fucking jungle starving to death. How long were you at it was a good idea. I want to like six, you know who I went to see was Tony the Souza. Ah, but he would, didn't, wasn't there. He actually bit, of course he bet. Like he ended up being somewhere else. And Tony to Susan's an MMA fighter or Jujitsu guys. Uh, a real free spirit who is, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll leave it at that. We were going to Brazil, we were in Brazil wants a, me and Eddie were talking about Iowasca and a ton of the suitors just listen to us and he goes, I'll fucking take that shit.

Speaker 6:          00:49:55       Do it. Just do it right now. It's like his attitude was like, it was like, let's do it. So gangster now he went down, the Amazon would like $40 or less. You know, just bummed is what you can do that. And it's like sleeping outside on the deck of the ships for months to get to Rio. So he came down from Peru. Wow. And I was like, that sounds like that. That would be a great trip. But it's dangerous and crazy. Just crazy. You might not make it. Yeah. And he's, I mean, he looks like an India, so he's not, and he's not like, oh gringo or whatever. But so you went down a long way there. Just six weeks. So it wasn't there for that long. That's a long

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       fucking time in the Amazon. It was, it was, it was a little longer than I, you know, it was kind of like my old way of life. I was like, Oh yeah, this will be fine. You know what I mean? It wasn't like I really thought it through. Um, what it actually would mean. And of course, you know, when you start taking care of a kid and all that, you know, it becomes, you know, you look into the abyss, the abyss, listen to you write it. Like it definitely changes you. So I couldn't stop thinking about, you know, the kid and, and you know, my wife and not being there if the big one hit. And that really was the catalyst. And then seeing how these guys were so competent, you know, it's one thing to hear like, oh yeah, they don't want in the forest and make whatever they need.

Speaker 5:          00:51:05       But then to see these guys go and make a backpack, like a pretty good backpack had to like, you know, mark and shit and just rip and it's wrong, you know, and, and, and just catch fish and just do, you know, really be able to provide easily for themselves. I love that you, they didn't give you a machete. Yeah. You realize they had sort of infantile that you, you're like, you can't do anything. You're the Gringo. Like, oh, just walk with your backpack. Don't touch shit. You know? And you can't get any everything. Yeah. Everything is with the machete. You don't touch anything in your hand, obviously, because it's the jungle and it's poisonous since thinking. And so, you know what a fucking crazy place to live for six years. And so literally everything around you is dense and it can't touch it with your hand because one out of how many things is a lot of the things that boys, but you know, it's not like you're going to die, it's just going to staying and swell and what you're going to have bites.

Speaker 5:          00:51:54       And there's all kinds of bugs. I don't even know what they are. You know what's cool too is that all the trees had a watermark on them. And what you realize is during the rainy season, basically the Amazon turns into like a c, there's dolphins swimming in the trees, there's river dolphins swimming. So the water comes up like 40 50 feet. So of all of these trees is, is a watermark for a couple, a couple of when the rainy season, because there's fish swimming and dolphins in the trees. Oh my God. So you're walking around. I was, how high is the watermark and moves around because, you know, but I was there in the dry season and, and some places it was at the top of trees and some places it was a, you know, it was, it was all over the place, but you could, it was very clear.

Speaker 5:          00:52:36       So it could have been 20, 30 feet above and uh, and they would talk about what happens during the rainy season and how different the landscape is because all your paths are gone and you're in a canoe doing everything, walking and all the life has to move up the tree. So all like the poison is answering the trees. So it's actually more dangerous because you bumped into a tree on oh yeah, it was, it was exceeded. It was a crazy scene. What was the goal when you went there? The goal? Uh, it was just, uh, you know, I was going to do this at the time there was a biologist who was going to come with me and, uh, you know, some local guys and there was like an area that was unexplored. It wasn't really unexplored, but a bio just meant a biologist hadn't been through there.

Speaker 5:          00:53:20       This is, you know, uh, it was up in the Peruvian part of the Amazon offer to Wyo, uh, which is a tributary and that he was going to look around and do stuff. So it was like kind of a partially science thing, but then he couldn't, couldn't leave his job. So it was me and just four dudes, three dudes. And it was like, you know, it's basically like going with like three Hicks, you know, into the woods in Montana. Like, you know, they were like, all right, what do you want to do? And I'm like, what do you guys want to do this? We just dicked around and we bought the raft was kind of cool. So he just tried to survive out there. We just hiked and survived and you know, saw a lot of monkeys and stuff, trail that you were falling off the trail and, and it was amazing. These guys could find their way. They map everything with the shadows. So at mid day you don't walk anywhere because you can't see where you're going. So with mid day they stopped and they put a stick in the ground and then we have a snack and you watched a stick and when the shadows, okay, now we can go again. Ah, yeah. That's cool. That's fucking, why not bring a compass? They're not hard to get. I don't know.

Speaker 7:          00:54:24       Well yeah, was a lot of stuff I would have done differently. In hindsight, it's easy to get

Speaker 5:          00:54:31       green. Hell for sure. And what if it rains for a couple of days? You know you're no shadows. Yeah. Yeah. You sit under your blue tarp and all that shit. Wait, yeah, the fence. Good for you, Jay. You should go. Yeah, I'm ready. Sign me up. How much weight did you lose? A lot. Yeah. I mean after I'd been eating to come back, I don't get ribbed. I get skinnier and fatter. That's what happens to me. That's funny. What did you guys eat? We ate, we brought, they brought again like it was, it wasn't a perfectly planned trip. They told me everything was fine, but I could have brought, you know, waterfall over pumps and instead I had to boil my water the whole time cause they were like, oh we got it and they don't got it. You know. So I had to miss stop and make a little fire to boil and then carry water and I was carrying water and coke, you know, coke bottles.

Speaker 5:          00:55:17       Oh it was, I didn't bring any, you know, any now jeans or anything like that. Oh Jesus. Cause they told me they had it off it, you know, it was all taken care of. Yeah. That was the idea of all taken care. Yeah. They don't care. Just the water is there. Like what's it like? It was so funny. Right. So these guys, they're, they're in there basically Indio guys. And they were like, one of them was like, so you've been to the ocean, right? I'm like, yeah, he's like, it's salt water. Right? And I'm like, Yup. And he's like, you don't drink it. I'm like, no, you can't drink the salt water cause you'll kill you. And he kind of looked at me like I was a pussy. Like he was like, hmm.

Speaker 7:          00:55:51       Yeah, I mean look at you and you're like, I can't drink the water here. You can't ignore it there. Like they can just drink the river water, just drink it. They grew up there. What do they live to be? 20. How old? How old are they get? It's crazy because some of them

Speaker 5:          00:56:05       there was, uh, the one really dangerous thing is the snakes. The fertile lance is like the most poisonous snake in the world. It's like, you know, turn your heart off. What's it called? The for the lance fern, f. E. R. N. D. Lance. It looks like a snake, you know, like, uh, I dunno if it was sneaky. Um, did you see one? Yeah, he killed one right by the camera and I'm walking on my flip flops at night. Right. And they killed one within five feet of camp. You have to kill him cause they're so dangerous. And these guys all had the, Oh yeah, my friend got been died. This guy didn't die, but you know, and we were three or four days from a hospital. Whoa. So you're just, it's luck of the draw, you know, with the snake will bite you. And then sometimes it'll put a ton of poisoning and sometimes those two a little, and it's sort of, that's why some people can, oh, he's tough.

Speaker 5:          00:56:50       He survived getting bit by a rattlesnake. I didn't, it just didn't give them the full dose basically. And it could be an older rattlesnake or it could be around, just make that already stuck. Something like recently, and the babies don't have that power. So babies are more, they don't, they always give a full dose. That's why they're more dangerous. Young rattlesnakes are the most dangerous because they don't regulate it. They just hit you with everything. There's a crazy photo sort of, um, blog online of a guy who got bit by a rattlesnake and then had all these operations to, to, to heal the area. [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:57:21       every time. Yeah, your body just rots away. Like a lot of people don't realize, like when that venom goes inside of you, it doesn't just like, oh my God, are you going to be sick for a while? But your arms going to run, I'm going to damage and all this. Yeah. To get like all these operations and skin grafts and shit and really scared of, well, the fertile and is like a hard stop or whatever, you know, whatever. I forget, I forget what it's called, but yeah, it just shuts down your cardio machine. And this is the Amazon in Peru. Is this where you were at? So it was in the d, the headwaters of the Amazon in Peru. And then there's a lot of a bunch of the Amazons and Peru, and that was the Amazon is so fucking massive, but it's incredible, isn't it?

Speaker 5:          00:57:57       Like being deforested and a scary, scary rate. No, it's totally, and what was interesting too is these guys, so there was a, we went to get some fruit and they were like, they just chop down the tree to get the fruit right. You know, like they don't climb up it, you know? Right. And, uh, you know, I was like, well, isn't, isn't that seem kind of counterpart in their defense that the trees grow fast, you know, eight years it's a full tree because it's, and they it down with the machetes. Yeah. But in their mind that, you know, it's like the jungle is endless, you know, like that's how they see the jungle. And then you look at the pictures of the fish market in Cusco and the fish used to be six feet long and now they're all this long. You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          00:58:35       And, and, and, and these guys wouldn't like, they go, oh yeah, we have to walk farther and farther to get the tree. Yeah. You cut them down and I'd like it doesn't, you know what I mean? Like in their heads it's limitless and I can never be finished or whatever. I guess the psychology of living in an, in someplace, I see Amazon, it's like, dude, listen, that's the last thing. You have to worry about this stuff going away. The resources are endless and just got to figure out how to stay alive. Yeah. Wow. You've ever read that book collapse by Jared diamond? Yeah, cause he's the guy who wrote guns, germs and steel. And he wrote a book about why society fail like the, you know, which, which I got into a little bit in disaster diaries, which was, you know, it's about why the Vikings had a colony in Greenland that died out.

Speaker 5:          00:59:19       Or Easter Island for instance. What happened there? Aliens, right? I'm not saying it's aliens, but why did their heads look like that man? Clearly. Clearly aliens. Is it possible you ever watch ancient aliens? Whenever Giorgio sucralose, who's a good buddy? He's been on the show a couple times, but whenever he goes, is it possible? It's got to go all I know it's coming. Oh No. What are you going to say? Deep flood isn't alien. Yes. That is possible. It is possible. Everything's possible. If were possible. If humans are possible, virtually everything's possible. Did they know who the fuck was on Easter Island? Uh, yeah, they, it was these know Polynesian. I mean that's what so let me look at like pack rat bins, which, which are like these, uh, pack rats. They collect stuff and they can sort of see what's going on with the foliage cause it kind of fossilized or whatever.

Speaker 5:          01:00:10       And uh, and I, I've eaten background by the way. It's real. It's delicious. Is Delicious. Delicious. Really Savory is gave me like a venison almost. No kidding. Where'd you get it? I was trapping them in Kansas and they're like little beavers. They're not like rats. They're like little hairy little guys. So a pack rat is not like a week, but does it look like around like a big rat? Yeah, big hairy ran. What's their diet? They eat grass and whatever they find around, you know, and they make these little mittens, which, which, you know what I heard mid and I'm like, Oh, what is it? Like a whole number, but it's like a little beaver lodge. It's like a small one, like a two foot high collection of sticks, like in a pile. And I learned how to make these little dead fall traps and you put a little peanut butter, you know, on the, on the end.

Speaker 5:          01:00:53       And he comes in and gets under the rock and it smashes and it kills them. Yeah. I've seen those dead fault traps on like survivor man and shit like that. It's one of those things has come totally counterintuitive. Like I could give you the pieces and you would never in a million years be like, cause it's, it makes sense once you do it once. That's why it's not even worth explaining. Cause it's like I could show you and you'd be like, Oh yeah, yeah, I can easily do that. But to talk about it as like a, so the stick goes wrong. You know, it's simple, but it's, it's um, it's tricky enough. I'm a survivor man fan, so I've seen that show like a hundred times. Yeah. But I, I've seen him make those. I have no idea how to make one. If I had to make one, make it yourself.

Speaker 5:          01:01:28       All this stuff you have to kind of do once at least, you know, and then you sort of, it's like the nuclear button. Once you know what's possible, you can do it right. But four minute mile, you know, let, let Straub but started with John Macpherson who is the guy I was with in Kansas. Oh that's how he learned. Well one, you know, not only place but one of the, he came there early on in his career and so this guy has like an old school guy. He's been around forever. What we did was you trapping pack rats a part of this book. Yeah, it's in there. Yup. Yeah. I caught a couple rats and yeah, just learning to do it, you know, and I went out every day and set up, you know, set up and you're in the hot sun and you know, it's like, it's almost like it took me back to my childhood and that weird way of like, you know, he used to like build forts for your like Gi joes and shit in the backyard because you don't get down and fiddle with shit in the grass anymore.

Speaker 5:          01:02:13       Like that doesn't, that's not something you do. It's true. And a lot of this survival stuff was this kind of move back like a primitive, like you have all day, you know, you're not doing anything else a day. You're not fucking check in your phone. Like you're not doing it an email. Like you're going to make fire today and it may take you three days, but like you go out and, and it's, it's interesting to kind of get into this other kind of time, you know, a sense of time and stuff like that. It's really fun.

Speaker 1:          01:02:39       One of the things that high moe said, the guy who lived a up in the Arctic or is that he believes that the problems of society come from the fact that we're, we're basically at nature hunters and gatherers. And when we remove ourselves from that and put ourself in the Sea of possibilities of modern society than 100% Nigeria crazy for said it fucks us 100% okay.

Speaker 5:          01:03:01       So yeah, we, we were hunter gatherers living in small groups. So if the human history is a book, right? We were hunters and we were living in tiny little family groups and hunting, gathering for 200 pages of that book. And then four paragraphs is the modern world, you know what I mean? Is it's knowing for progress is just civilization. And then like the last sentence is the last two centuries. So that's how on like unequipped, we are on an evolutionary scale to handle cars. You're, you know, running a nuclear power plant. Twitter. Yeah. Twitter is the stock market, all that shit. Like you're just intuitively like your gut reaction to all that shit is not valid. You know what I mean? Like you, your reaction to a person, it's pretty good. Like you're good at reading people and getting like a feeling, oh he makes me nervous. Avoid that guy. But uh, the big system, so like all those like stock mark guys are like, oh, I had a feeling like you got lucky. That's all it happened, dude. You know? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:03:59       yeah. It's a very strange situation where obviously the world is changing forever and our biology is taking a long time, can't catch up, catch up. And how does that work? Does it ever catch up? I don't think it does. I Dunno. Do you think that's what autism is? Do you think that's what a lot of diseases are? Is that low? The body's like scrambling to try to figure out a way to survive this strange time

Speaker 5:          01:04:22       or just random mutation and you know, with evolution is meditation and

Speaker 1:          01:04:27       yeah, an adaptation adaptation. Due to that. One of the things that I read about, um, autism was that the be the need for emotions. Like when we become symbiotic with machines, right? That it's not going to the need for emotions. It's going to be essentially removed, right? Like we've already are like a lot of our reward systems, like the, the reason why hunting and gathering is so exciting and so fulfilling. It's because that's what's necessary to survive. If you, you've, you've fished before, I'm sure you know that feeling when you catch a fish, God and you reel it in. Yeah, it's very live. You're going to live, it's like really primal. So it's a weird thing when you know you've made, you've got an animal that you just caught and it's going to get, provide you with sustenance is a very strange sort of a psych. It's goes back to your genes electric. Yeah. It's

Speaker 6:          01:05:18       very electric and it's hard to describe. Yeah. Um, those jolts and those, those positive feelings that you get from that hunter and gatherer thing, eventually we're not going to need that anymore. When you, everything is like, have you seen that Japanese guy that figured out a way how to make steak out of human feces? Delicious, delicious steak? I'm not joking. All right. I just tweeted it. Uh, somebody tweeted it to me and I retweet. It wasn't even fucking believe it is true.

Speaker 3:          01:05:46       Why would you even go with the steak versus I would try like it like a risotto first before I went right for us because

Speaker 6:          01:05:51       steak is meat. Um, yeah. I don't know. I'm going to touch that one. I don't know why. Yeah, I don't know either. But it's, yeah. Crazy though. This, this guy figured out a way to, to actually make meat out of the proteins, nutritional value left in your fees. Well, it's definitely like your feces is pretty because our diets are so rich. You're not taking all the nutritional value out of your waste that you should be. Yeah, I guess so. If you were starving your, your feces would be a lot less nutritional. But even then, I mean, how efficient is the human digestive digestive tract? I don't, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, but I don't, I don't think it's necessary to, my shit doesn't meet out of Shit. My Shit doesn't stink and stick. Delicious.

Speaker 3:          01:06:38       I the worst thing that happened, Joe, one of my toilet paper rolls fell into my toilet and then I took like the biggest shit ever on top of it and then I stood up and I'm like, Oh, what now? I had it like you'll get it in their old 12 members in there. You didn't know a hole in your ass. I just opened up the lid and it's whoever used it before my have shut the lid after it fell in the toilet already. I just open up the lid and sat down with trainspotting. You had like dive in there, get after that. And then I put in an empty net, wrap those plastic containers, you know, like where you put the boat wipes. Then we had an empty one, but it was too small and I squished it. And all this water. Listen,

Speaker 6:          01:07:15       just Google worse Google Japanese. This is from daily tech. Dot comes where? Ah, the, the article, Google Japanese make delicious new nourishing steaks from human feces. And you'll get this article. It is really crazy. The Tokyo sewage service in Japan serves over 13 million people, approximately 2000, 200 square kilometer area. And this guy, um, they approached this Guy Mitch. So Yuki Ikea, who's a researcher from that guy. Okay. Yama laboratory and their ideas, they, the problem is they had too much sewer mud, also known as a shouldn't human excrement. Okay. And so the excrement is a breeding ground for scores of bacteria. So this guy came up with this crazy idea to make food out of that. No Way. Yeah. I mean, I mean, you know, in a way it's good, right? Because we're going to have food problem, you know? And if we could recycle everything, if we could recycle, you know, hey, let's do it.

Speaker 6:          01:08:21       You know, I don't get it. The first idea is what the guy does. The first step is they cook the bacteria and it kills the bacteria. And then they extract their proteins via separation technique. Right. And Soy protein is added to enhance the flavor. That's how you know that it tastes terrible. Let's make your food tastes better. It's better because you're eating shit and Tofa. Oh, that's a tough one. Yeah. It's even finished with a red food color to give it a comforting, whew. Well, you know, they die. Mcdonald's dies their meat to make it a blessing to be translucent, translucent. Well, it's so fatty. Really? Is that what it is? They have put up these hamburger meat diets. I mean, I don't know. It's, that's, it could be an urban myth. I could be wrong. Could be, you've gotta be careful. I know. It'd be so many Snopes that, um, there's a, a website, I forgot what the website is, where they take a cheeseburger from Mcdonald's and they just let it or a handle on what happened. Let it sit out and it fucking never rots. So shelf life is like a twinkie. Yeah. Maybe if she'd go to the radio, carbon dating and isotopes and like if you know that twinkie shirts and big back, it's actually the Twinkies don't last forever. And it's just a myth, I believe. Don't know. How long do they last?

Speaker 3:          01:09:30       Like I think it's a couple of months after or a month or something like that. After the, there's a,

Speaker 6:          01:09:35       the sugar goes off. Why didn't you try? Because you had some of the last 25 to take one. Put It on your desk if you're under 100 donors. Yeah. Take one and put it on a plate and see if, uh,

Speaker 3:          01:09:48       and then find that whole thing. By the way, I would have you started buying it if you guys got into nine and yet what does that mean? Vine is a program that Twitter just buy it. You remember about a year ago, somebody on one of these podcasts ask, what do you think's next? What's the next Twitter? And I said video, Twitter. It's pretty much what it is. And so what it is is Twitter just bought this company called vine and it's like seven seconds of video and you just pretty much, you can just do seven seconds or you could do like stop motion.

Speaker 6:          01:10:14       All right, so hold on. Seven seconds. Is this ready? Go Dude Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, that's not enough. That's enough time to do something stupid.

Speaker 3:          01:10:26       Yeah. And but what's cool is that it loops it but like an animated Gif. So everyone's making pretty much animated gifts, but it does it with the sound.

Speaker 6:          01:10:35       So how many of them are just girls asked is about growing up in the horn, of course is leading the way in and six seconds is all you need for more. Are you allowed to have porn on Twitter? Cause some girls do. Like sometimes you go to their profile and all of sudden it's a cock in her mouth.

Speaker 3:          01:10:47       It's just because they haven't been found. Wow. There's a lot of them out there. There's pretty lacks. Some of the best people though is Brody. Brody is fucking hilarious at the divine for. It's just like pretty much got big in the last couple of weeks and now it's blowing the fuck up. Or I'll show you some. That's fascinating man. And what it does is it just loops the brave new world. Well, it's, that's know. I have not seen any,

Speaker 6:          01:11:14       I've heard the backed of our strange, strange fucking wacky culture where we're, we're getting more and more ink interconnected, giving people a little seven seconds glimpse to your life, you know, over and over and over again.

Speaker 8:          01:11:26       Right.

Speaker 6:          01:11:28       It's weird stuff to prepare for. It's like they're there. The real question is, what's next? And are these instincts and all the, these hunting and gas, are they holding us back or is it inevitable that things change? Is it good that they change?

Speaker 5:          01:11:42       Well, I mean, the question really comes, I think, you know, they're not going to change unless there's a, an, you know, an evolutionary advantage. Unless they're selected out. Like, yeah, people are always like, oh, your pinky toe is gonna disappear. No, it's not. Not unless it's like, unless guys without the pinky toe are really like really good looking and have a lot of kids. You know what I mean? There's got to be right and evolutionary pressure for that change. So I kind of feel like we've removed all the evolutionary pressures because we've created the perfect environment for ourselves. You know, and there's a lot of guys that are smarter than me. They talk about, there still are subtle pressures of work. It's just, I don't know what they are.

Speaker 6:          01:12:17       It's just not the same sort of pressures that exist in the natural world. We spent at all created these contained environments. These cities were perfectly suited for this environment. It's very strange and it's, uh, it's so confusing because as science advances and he gets to the point where they have nanotechnology to keep your body alive and eat all the cancers in you and you're going to be able to genetically engineer you. So you look like a super athlete and they're going to be able to change your mind and make you symbiotically connected to electronics. Put Google in your brain. I mean Google glasses is just right now. It's, you wear it well how long before it's an insert, plug it in. I mean when is it going to be a contact lens? Cause they're also considering that they're considering contact lenses that show you information on the Lens, right?

Speaker 6:          01:13:00       Like some sort of a Bluetooth or something. Contact Lens. Will they be able to communicate wirelessly and you'll see fucking images on your eyes when you know how long, but when, when does that, when is that going to be a reality? When I was assistant to a story on NPR about robotics, like taking over, you know, Blah Blah, blah, that old story about, you know, and you, and you wonder if there are certain point where it's just cheaper to get people to do it because people were cheaper. You know what I mean? Like isn't it at some point but exponential. Yeah. Well that's true, right? Especially in the real issue with certain countries don't value human life. There's this countries where and then it's always the countries that have the most people. Right? So it's like what you hear about human rights violations. Like China's like a real tricky one when it comes to like factory workers and she's just so God damn anything.

Speaker 5:          01:13:47       What are you going to sort of, what are you showing me? The vine. That's what it is. It's just like a quick animation thing and it just has like sometimes it has sound, sometimes it doesn't, but it's caught on to the point. Everybody is fucking doing it right now. WHO's everybody? I'm not like you're not doing it. Look at Twitter. Have you done it? Yeah, I'm, I'm all over. When did you start doing it? About four days ago. How can people find you

Speaker 6:          01:14:12       on it? You just started doing it and you're just making little videos like just for fun or like ever since it came out I'm already not even using Instagram anymore. It's good. You jump on it right now and people are getting really good at it. Like a will. Sasso is really funny. Add it and you could become the next Twitter champ. A chess master. He started right now. I wonder where it ends. I just started tweeting, finally fucking got ahold of it somehow. How come you can't Kid Sam Sheridan? What's the, I dunno, I just don't have that fighters. I probably could. I don't know who Sam Sherman. Because you've got a new book out man. Call. Call it a fighter's mind. Your new book is disaster diary. Just as confusing as fuck man. At one point. But I am doing it. I am. I am. I, it's funny that I was talking to a guy who works there and he's like, yeah, it just clicks for people at some point.

Speaker 6:          01:14:59       Twitter. And then it finally clicked for me a little bit. Oh, Twitter is amazing. You know what's the most amazing thing for me is retweeting things again, cool shit that people send me and then retweeted them. Yeah. It's um, between um, Matt stags, my publicist, he sends me three times a day, the nuttiest shit that he finds on the Internet as part of like his gig. And, um, between that and the shit that I get from dudes on Twitter, it's amazing the access to new ideas and stories you have, the Av, that change is one of the biggest changes in human culture over the last hundred years. What are you doing Bryan? I'm finding it, finding that do a dance, do a dance change is one of the biggest changes in a, in human culture. I think it's, well, she had the ubiquity of information, you know, you can get stuff, you know, you can know everything.

Speaker 6:          01:15:52       You can be in India, in India, and get all the information that we can get right here and all that. Yeah. As long as there's some sort of a connection to your phone or some sort of, even a fucking two g, you know, if you're in some shitty country, just take a little slower, but you're still gonna be able to connect to the database. And now, especially with Google answers for questions, just at your service. Yeah. Right there. It's fucking drag out tracking. You watch it everything. But who's tracking who are, what are they going to do and how can, yeah. That's what I feel like tracking them too. There's so much information. Like you feel free to track my, well I think it's really interesting that people are really concerned with privacy as they should be and they're really concerned with the government interfering with their privacy as they should be. But the fucking head of the CIA got Boston. Right. That's what's fascinating to me. It's like, by the way, you're not in all your emails are all online. Yeah. [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:16:49       who is the head of the spooks. Okay. The FBI goes and investigates him and it's all there if you can't get away. And not only that, but like what a bunch of fucking condoms. They weren't willing to like look away. Like they wanted to bring that out in the open. The eye doesn't like the CIA. Like isn't that crazy? You would think that everyone is in the same team. You know the FBI, the CIA during the same team. I feel like they're not. There's some probably so much gets fucked up I pissing contest and you never even know about like major diplomacy like this, you know like the head of this and that and like, oh I got the wrong chair funk this meeting. You know what I mean? And like they walk in and like we don't know why we're at war. That's cause that guy got the wrong chair.

Speaker 6:          01:17:35       Hey you, why am I on the corner of the table? Don't respect me. Yeah. I shouldn't be at the head of the table and my chat should be gold dot. Yeah, there's a, you don't even know the pissing contest is that fact that the FBI doesn't get along with the CIA. I'm like, you motherfucker. How do you expect me to be patriotic when you contour running the whole military industrial complex are going after each other and over pussy. Okay. It's not worth Patraeus Pussy. Well it's not though. That was a thing though. It was also about Libya. It was about Bengazi. It was also about them attacking like the way it was handled. The, the tacking of the U s embassy apparently. And that was part of the whole scandal that went down was they felt like they did a poor job of handling that whole attack on the US embassy and somehow or another it's connected.

Speaker 6:          01:18:24       I don't know how we, civilians will probably never know exactly what, probably more professor who, you know, it's just pedestrian and boring people just, I don't know why it's all about puts it, but it's all about the fact that there's no privacy anymore, you know? Yeah. And everything is recorded and I'm going, of course you've seen all the videos of the media right across, say wild, right. You know what I found out the Russians have a lot of dash cams because of insurance fraud because the Russian people just fucking slam on the brakes or in front of it. You hit to me named sue you. Um, apparently it's super dominant. Russian Russians drive. So bananas. And you ever seen some of the Russian dragon videos? I think I tweeted about it or talking about it or something. W rushing driving videos are fucking horrible. They're amazing.

Speaker 6:          01:19:11       They are animals. There's two types of really loony driving videos out there. I don't want to generalize, but I'm Gunna two types. The Chinese, which we've had on the show before, and Russians, Chinese for being fucking completely clueless. Like someone told me, and I don't know if it's just showing it retro, but it's not racial, it's, it's, it's more racial than racist, but what it is is that the culture, the Chinese culture, because there are so many people interacting with each other that they're comfortable bumping into each other. It's a part of the normal culture population's so big and you just get used to it. And if you're in Asia, like you have to accept that like this is the way they are. They're not being rude. It's just pumping into, it was kind of like that. You've been there, you know what I mean? Yeah. I didn't find that in Tokyo. I found them to be very polite, but apparently China, you're, you're right, it's thick, high density population. People are touching you. But the idea is that they're used to looking straight ahead and not looking to the left and looking to the right and their culture also

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       rewards or sort of encourages mining your own fucking business and keeping your eyes on yourself, not paying attention and not wandering around and undisciplined gates. Well that sort of applies. They're driving, they have blinders on and they just sort of go where they were trying to go and mention this. This sort of way of looking at the world does not work when you're dealing with cars. When you're sober you have to avoid traffic and

Speaker 5:          01:20:31       brings it right back to my book, which is really Nice because situational awareness was one of the things I really got into. And situational awareness is exactly that. Like paying attention to your surroundings and it's a huge survival trait. You know, it's like the military train it, they talk about essay all the time, training your essay and they do things. But you know, it's that natural thing like you do in a parking lot, right? Cause you're, you know, you're not in the freeway, you're kind of space out, listen to music. But in a parking lot, you're, you know what's going on and you're creeping around and your situation and where, you know, that's kind of the difference.

Speaker 1:          01:21:01       And your book also covered how important one little mistake can be in a critical situation. Like especially in a fire, you were talking about, you spent a lot of time fighting forest fires and how you go left when you should've gone. Right and you're fucked. You're trapped. And, and, and the only way to find out is to make that mistake.

Speaker 5:          01:21:22       Yeah. What did he say? Like, you know, fire like a lot of things, but fire supplies the test first and then less than second. Right. You know, which is so you, you, you get tested and then afterwards they go back and they break down all the things you did wrong or did right. And you, everybody else can learn the lesson, but at the time you just get tested and it's pass fail. Like you live or die. And it's just, and that's kind of the way fire wildland fire has been. And, and, uh, we go back and we studied tragedy fires where people died like a 30 mile or a storm King. And there's a lot of those names, but you sort of break it down scientifically what they did wrong when it's barely, you know, hindsight's 20, 20, it totally easy. But at the time, you know, I don't feel like these, I really want to hear about how those, the cops looking for Dorney a, uh, shot up the hood of the cars.

Speaker 5:          01:22:10       You know what I mean? I really want to kind of, you know, that's the kind of thing I'm interested in explaining that story, but people don't know. So there was this been this huge manhunt in La and um, it's Dorner is it Charles Dorner? Ll Cool J. Yeah, he looks a lot like ll cool j a fat ll cool. J and J is huge by the [inaudible] 70 and not fat, like pretty bulky, strong after looking dude. And uh, it was, you know, he was like, you know, ex ex military and very dangerous. And he wrote this rant on Facebook and killed some cops and they finally tracked him down. But yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:22:43       kill the cops. Family too. Is Dot her daughter and her husband, he really, yeah, he killed a cop's daughter and her husband, um, you know that the guy who was representing him at the trial the same, right? Yeah, he was, he was very, uh, bitter about it. Know about this by the way. Oh, a lot of people don't know the story, man. A lot of people don't know who, what the name was. Trusted him. Everyone's like, oh, Jay, not necessarily. It may mean there's a

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       lot of people are sort of vaguely aware of it, but, but the La people don't know about the cop shooting up the car. They shot up this, they show up two cars, they shut up two different colored, you know, again, it was dawn. So color, you know, everything's monochromatic. It don't, it's hard to see color. So I don't blame him for that. But they shot up a car with two Mexican old ladies in it. So they will do it, deliver newspapers, newspapers at 4:00 AM. And they shot them, they shot them, and then they shut up at surfer. I've got white guy in his truck and nobody died. They don't think they hit the other guy. They shot on his truck up. But so you wonder how trigger happy they are. And of course LAPD has terrible reputation. Yeah. Um, but also you sort of see, you know, it's like very, it's there.

Speaker 5:          01:23:51       People are still people, they're still human and you see what stress does to people, you know, and you see shit that's not there and you, you know, it's, it's this sort of amazing, I'd love to kind of see the after action reports they come up with, you know, ask the people to get out of the car, put their hands up or so I think they started moving. Yeah. I think one of the cars, they even just rammed it. So they just started shooting. That's the mother fucker. Yup. That's him. Boom. And like, you know, it's, it's like confirmation bias and all that shit. You know what I mean? Like you so scary having people in payroll, people being in control is so dangerous. And cops, you know, the truth is, you know, people talk to me about firearms a little bit. You know, cause I spent about three weeks straight training farms.

Speaker 5:          01:24:34       It's one of the best firearms instructors in the country. This guy, tiger monkey and Alabama. And you know, you have to train your ass off to use a gun successfully in an altercation. Like because of what we've talked about, this stress, what stress does to you, you know, and cops, the most police, you know, they, they have the budget to train, you know, a couple of days a year and they never get a train, you know, hand to hand. So they, they, they, they really don't get paid enough to shoot. Swat team guys are different and they get paid to shoot enough, you know, and ammunitions expensive and blah blah. But even cops, like they just don't shoot enough, you know. So like the idea of arming teachers is fine as long as you're going to pay for them to train and train a lot. They going to train every month.

Speaker 5:          01:25:19       Yeah, they're going to be part of their life or they're not going to be able to do it and it's not going to work. You know? It's pointless. It's more dangerous because then you have guns around. Someone else can tell me there was, I don't know, whatever, but it's like it's just you. This is a fact, like you have to train your ass off with a weapon with a firearm because again, it's, it's complex motor skills. It's not intuitive and even that doesn't guarantee that you're going to be able to perform under stressful situations. How do you condition yourself to perform under stressful situations? Like what is, if you were going, it's like say, okay look, it's what the number 10 let's put, let's pretend the end of the world is coming. Some Sheridan has his own branch and the Sam Sheraton ranch, you're going to figure out a way to train, train people how to do.

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       You're going to come. And that's what the military does. So you do as much as you can in terms of, you know, loud noises, a smoke, uh, you know, fear, unexpected things happening and you know, and, and realistically recreate these scenes. You know, they find when people are shooting at human targets, the targets, even silhouettes that looked like a person, they're much better at killing people in battle then if they're shooting it at just the crosshairs or just to Bullseye. Hmm. So you'd have to condition, you know, that's what they have. All those houses that they walk through and you train and train. That's what Swat teams do. And Swat teams do great. You know, because they train and train and train and train and train, and then they can, they can execute it, you know? And also swat members, they're probably been on a few of those.

Speaker 5:          01:26:48       By the time he gets to a certain point in their career, you know, it's not his first, you know, he's on these a lot of times and, and, and even those guys, they can get so hyped up that they make mistakes, you know? And it happens. And the tiger was telling me that like, there was a police, uh, house to walk through it, you know, for a shooting. And there was a, uh, you know, a four foot by four foot bullet trap that was behind the target. So there's a target, you know, like a person and they walked to the door and they have to draw and shoot this thing and guys are missing the trap from like six feet away. Whoa. So they're just going, Eh, and they're shooting into the air or the shooting, you know, and these are cops, you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          01:27:26       It's not you and me who was never like, oh, ah, you know what I mean? It's like they, they, and, and this whole thing about the knife being better than the gun. You ever hear that one? No. So the, so, uh, there's a thing called the, the taller rule, the Tula rule, which is a, a cop in Vegas in the 80s, um, started timing, uh, how long it would take for a guy to cut you with a knife before you could hold on holster and get your gun out and present and shoot him. And he found that from 21 feet or less, he was going to get you before you could get a shot off. Oh, so they call it the 21 foot rule. So if a guy has a knife and he's closer in 21 feet, you got to shoot him. Or you know, you think you think all the guns better, I want a gun.

Speaker 5:          01:28:10       But actually because it's, it doesn't jam, it doesn't screw up. It's not fine motor skill. This is not a fine motor skill, right? This is, this is, this is simple. You know how to do this. You're born, you're going to die. No one had a hit somebody with a knife and it never goes away. Even how stressed you are. So that's one of the reasons why they actually say a knife is better than the gun in a lot of situations is corrected. A huge, I did a long training session of knife fighting, which is, I'm want to get nightmare nightmares, dude. Nightmares. It's terrible. What happens once you start getting intellect? The awfulness of getting cut open. Yeah. It's an awful [inaudible] Jujitsu, you know? It's like I have a knife. Good luck. It doesn't matte black belt. I'm just, it's like, it just starts going and you never, you can't turn it off.

Speaker 5:          01:28:58       It's like, it just keeps going. As long as it's sharp, you know? It's easy. Yeah. It's terrible. Yeah. Collin and I talked about that when we came to butchering a deer. Like though the reality of questions, it opens up. Yeah. With this razor knife protein. Yeah. Flesh just sorta separates. Yeah. It's not difficult to separate the essential parts of your body. It's like an uncooked egg. Yeah. It's not like a hard boiled egg. It's like, that's what your skin and flesh like and that's what these knife, the knife stuff is about you. Like you don't like, I don't like, you know, so you've, you've punched me. I don't just cut your arm and I like that. I go and I shave, you know, a huge slap a skin off your arm and now think now what are you doing? Like now your mind is your, yeah, you're not thinking about me anymore.

Speaker 5:          01:29:41       Yeah, you're not, you know. Well they also say that some of the knife, it's very easy for them to punch you in the face because you're so concentrated on that knife that kick you in the balls and punch in the face. Like you, you really focused on it. You won't even stop it. We used to do like spark, like last part with like these little um, uh, like stun blades, blades. It's got like a little shock to it. Like it's, you know, it's like a bee sting, um, shocking electric shock knife. Yeah. Cause he ain't company makes him, yeah, yeah, yeah. And the crackle and they, they crack the crackling is almost scarier because you're like, cause it's, it's like the sound, it sounds like a light saber or something, you know, it's like a beast thing. You're like, oh, that's not that big a deal.

Speaker 5:          01:30:19       But it's the idea that you just got chopped. And uh, I was doing it in fighting, you know, and whatever. And the worst is when you don't have a knife and he does, this is just the lambs to slaughter dude. You're like, you're hyperventilating. Like trying to time the jump, like got something like God, I'm down. I took his back and I had the knife in one hand and I was trying to get the choke in and it was like I had to let it go because I couldn't hold that knife with one. Actually I think I had the knife and he was going to take it away from me and I started choking him cause I'm like, oh, they'll give them something to think. And like I had, I couldn't, I had to stay with that knife because it was so devastating that the choke was like, he's like, he doesn't give a shit.

Speaker 5:          01:30:56       He can because he knows it's not, I can't get them in, you know, 15 seconds. He's going to have the knife and he's going to start, you know, what are the, uh, did you like, do like a, when you have a knife fight in class, do you use a rubber ninth? Yeah. You do rubber knives, real knives too, just to kind of have techniques that you love. Yeah, yeah. One of disagreement, you know, so it's a lot of it's from Filipino stick fighting and the Philippines is famously the place where, you know, this was like an art form and they were invaded by, uh, all kinds of sorted people so that the Spaniards came and the Portuguese invaded. And then the Japanese came with, so they, they've been exposed to all these styles and, uh, the, the name and it's like, I think Palau is that people have a knife. So, you know, it's very, you know, a part of their culture. And also they were enslaved for 300 years. You know what I mean? They were longer than America's been a country. They were a colony of Spain and then the u s and all that stuff. So they've got that in their system. And then so they've really turned knife fighting into a high art. And I love it. And you scream was really fun. I actually got really into it. Does it scream

Speaker 6:          01:32:00       out or Filipino arts? Do they have any, uh, striking arms? Yeah, well they do a boxing thing and, and, and um, you know, people talk about Manny Pacquiao doing, you know, what is it that it was a call, I don't know, but it's, it's part of a screen. But basically it's all part of this. And the screen was even a Spanish word, you know, and people, I think there's, um, a Filipino movements that kind of reclaimed the art. But the arts, the whole nature of, it's very democratic. Like it comes from everywhere and it's got all kinds of different terms and it's very, it's very, it's very inclusive. I'm not, correct me if I'm wrong, but were the Philippines created by Chinese and Spaniards getting together? Isn't that like, yeah, it was a Spanish colony for a long time and they were invaded by everybody.

Speaker 6:          01:32:41       Like they, you know, they were islanders. It was, you know, Micronesia, whatever stuff. And that's the real fucking problem, man. That's what we've sort of limited more than ever before is people invading people just taking over their land. We've sort of, that's slowed down quite a bit still going on when we're doing it. But like if you look at like what you used to have to deal with, like most of the world, but it's like sitting down, man, I hope nobody shows up. Yeah. Somebody showed up dead. Yeah. It wasn't like if you were an American you could just, well there was no Americans obviously, but if you were an Irishman, you could just say all the way to Fiji, they would eat you. Yeah. You know, you couldn't just show up and Bornea they would fucking kill. You know, they talk about how dangerous, uh, in Papa New Guinea, they, there are people that hadn't been contacted and they talk about how dangerous strangers are.

Speaker 6:          01:33:26       Like, it's so dangerous to meet new people. It's like everybody is on red alert. What did you hear about that, those fishermen that were killed recently? No. Yeah, the one of the last uncontacted tribe did day and these people, they, they fucked up and they wound up a short, they were drunk and they were in a fishing boat. I think it's, I, I want to say New Guinea, some left. Apparently there's something Central America and South America. I mean, there's killed New Guinea. Uh, the, uh, the story was that they, uh, they had gotten drunk and they washed up on the shore in the wrong place. Yeah. They, they, they fucked up and these people were there and uh, they just fucking, they killed him, man. Yeah. And that, this, this one uncontacted tribe. Yeah. They don't, and they have to wait until they want to retrieve the bodies, but they have to wait until these people move to the other side of the island.

Speaker 6:          01:34:18       These natives because if they go over there, they're going to have to kill them. And they're the, like the last of these tribes and these, uh, these poor drunk fishermen just fucked up and drifted a shore and they just jacked him. Yeah. And again, that goes back to like, what's most of human history, Ben? That, yeah. I mean not this modern thing where you get in the subway and there's people you don't know right behind you. Right, right. Yeah. Or that you don't even speak their language and you're staying at the four season and it's file and then, you know, and they're cleaning your room. Well, you are, it's a weird, or whatever, any hotel, but it'd be even crazier. How about, you know, you go to one of those things that, uh, students do. What do they stay at those, uh, the hostels, dorm room fill you of other people that speak a language you don't understand you're sleeping together. Yeah. I mean, that's a modern society. Yeah. It's fascinating. And so in that sense, it's much safer now than ever before, but that could all erode immediately with one astro.

Speaker 5:          01:35:18       Yeah. Yeah. No, there was a great, uh, hold on, let me just, talking about the asteroids,

Speaker 6:          01:35:23       did you, do you follow at all? Um, like, uh, the, the history of asteroidal impacts or a little bit,

Speaker 5:          01:35:30       a little bit. I mean, I'm kind of this actually have a, yeah, not Clovis, but I actually, you know, a little bit, you know, I'm into it, you know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          01:35:37       That's cool. Yeah. Did you see the new thing that the Russian scientists are Russian astronomers have found? They believe there's one that's going to hit 93 years from now? No, it's, yeah, they think they found one that's a real motherfucker. Right. That's going to hit that Russian shit was scary. Yes, it was awesome. I loved it. I explained to people that might not have, you know, make getting up later. Um, the rush we're talking about Russian media or impacts the, the video footage, uh, that we were talking about earlier with the cams, the video cams, these people than their dash cams, the one where it hit and it's like, boom. Right. It was brighter than the sun for a second half. Fuck, flash hit. Let me, let me read you this. So this is what,

Speaker 5:          01:36:15       so there's, I think there's about a thousand a year of these little ones and then then the, the rock of one third of a meter across explodes with the a hundred tons of dynamite. And that happens 40 times a year, three meters across the rock hits with a force of 2000 tons of dynamite. Oh my God. And 30 meters, it's now an asteroid. And then if it, if it hits its 2 million tons of dynamite were flat and everything was in six miles at a hundred meters and asteroid is the equivalent of 80 million tons of diamond light. And that was what hit in 1908 and flattened, you know, 1200 miles of the forest in Siberia.

Speaker 6:          01:36:56       Is that, that proven that a, that's Tom Guskey right? You go school. Yes. And you know that for a fact?

Speaker 5:          01:37:00       Well I think so. And then, and a half mile across the crater is nine miles wide. A fireball that is 25 times larger than the sun and it's a 7.8 earthquake when it hits and would cause nuclear winter and in civilization, Oh my God. But the species would survive. Then the next biggest one up a six miles across plus, uh, is the end of everything. And that's like what happened to the dinosaurs.

Speaker 6:          01:37:29       Right. It gets in that like how it just starts like flickering like it. Like it's like a flicker almost. Yeah. And that's a little baby. This little baby I've had that I've seen one really, really close up once. I seen one that here in Calabasas died out. Yeah. Like a shit what you call a shooting star. And there was apparently one that was filmed in San Francisco as well. Yeah. Yeah. And these have nothing to do with that. Other Astra has two really close

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       by to 41 or inside the outer ring of Sal. It's awesome. That's how close this fucking thing is. And that one is a motherfucker. If that one hits us, look at all this damage. This thing. Yeah. That was a big one. The one that came. This was crazy. Just how it looks. It looks like almost like a filter, right? Instagram. Yeah, look at that. It just brightens the whole thing. It's amazing that everybody likes swerved off the road. Everybody's like, dude to do. Yeah. There's a good compilation at live leak right now. It has all of them in one long video. Yeah. This is strange times where we get to document this. I know. Whereas before if this happened, it would just be mean. We wouldn't even hear it. Oh, a thing about it. Yeah. We would have no idea that this even happened in Russia just 10 years ago.

Speaker 5:          01:38:40       Yeah. And I think that actually really does contribute to the paranoia. Sure. Cause like you've seen the footage now of the tsunami and Fukushima, like you can't, you can't get away from it. You know, and the, and the nine 11 you've seen that come down a million times and this, it's just, it's, it makes you, it's like you'd like to think you're sophisticated and, and that you don't believe in advertising and that that shit doesn't affect you. But the truth is like you're very simple. You're an animal and that shit works on you. You know, and you believe that

Speaker 1:          01:39:09       life is a Sandra Bullock movie. Meanwhile, Sandra Bullock, he'd be like, she's great rocks come from the fucking sky and drop on things. Ooh, there was, um, there's a, uh, an area, um, in time about 13,000 years ago that I'm fascinated by because I've been reading all this stuff about this, what it looks like, nuclear class, this green glass they found all over the, uh, the earth and about 13,000 years and they think it was a series of meteor impacts about 13,000 years ago, all over the globe. Oh Wow. They found this stuff. It's really cool. They've found like big people were around for that stuff. And there's oral history. Oh yeah. Well that's, that's what they think is, you know, the, the, the ancient history theorists that follow sort of an alternative timeline. Right. I believe that there's been some rises and falls and that accounts for Atlanta and a lot of different, well the men

Speaker 5:          01:40:08       dry and then you know, that broken the Atlantic went in and flooded it.

Speaker 1:          01:40:13       Well, there's a bunch of, I mean I'm sure there's been a series of cataclysmic disasters, but they're just coming to terms now with this proliferation of this green glass all over the earth at about 13,000 years ago. So it was enough to kill a lot of fucking people wipe out a lot of shit, but not enough to kill everybody and, and burn it into the collective unconscious of this can happen. But this, these impacts that we saw a hertz, 400 people, they didn't leave behind any of this green shit as far as I know. Yeah. It depends on, I mean, there's probably much bigger, what you're talking about, this stuff was the same stuff that is, um, created when you have nuclear tests. Oh, right. It's sort of green. Super Glad, right? Yeah. We're rock is just bull

Speaker 6:          01:40:54       asked to buy this impossible force, but apparently it's all over the world at 13,000 or something. Fucked us sideways just and it, it also coincides with the end of the ice age. Right. Which it might've been. That might've changed the climate. Sure, sure. It's really some crazy shit. Well, yeah, we wouldn't be surprised at all. Yeah. They also think that it might have something to do with some of the mass extinctions that went on during that time. There's a lot of confusion as to like what happens to the wooly mammoths and you have to think anymore men hunted them out or you know. Yeah. But I've heard that, that there's a lot of people that say, well that's crazy what you're talking about guys with spears and they're, they're hunting out there. They're going to, you're going to wipe out these motherfuckers. Really? Yeah, I know. I don't know. I'm not, yeah, I dunno.

Speaker 6:          01:41:38       I'm pointing to, right. I've heard asteroids of her other things, but it's weird to think that this society we have now, which seems so permanently here we are place talking through wires that are connected to the Internet, whatever the fuck that is and sends this audio file out to a million people. But the think that this could all go away and you trap, it's an hack rats with rocks. Yeah, no, it's, it's, it's sort of funny because you never, you don't think it's going to happen and you don't think it's possible. It's like a, it's a little bit like being on the freeway where you don't think an accident. It's impossible. Like it sort of feels like it can never happen and you know, and then shit happens. And, and uh, it's, it's like a, you know, in California, earthquake insurance gets, you know, it's expensive right after the earthquake and then it gets cheaper and cheaper and cheaper because it, but actually the danger is going up, right.

Speaker 6:          01:42:29       The risk is, you know, but, but if people are buying it, you forget, you know? Yeah. People aren't buying it and it's, it's, uh, this is human nature. We're were simpler. There's like, you know, it's a myth that man is a rational actor. You're an emotional actor and you rationalize it. You know, like we're trying, we're trying to figure out how to rationally quantify bounded rationality in humans too. Yeah, no, totally. The idea that we have access to the events that take place in the lives of billions of people. It's just too nutty. It's like, how are we supposed to pay attention to all these different events, animal attacks and meteors and sharks and fucking all this shit is happening because you're dealing with an insane number of human beings and insane number of lives. Totally. So if you look at life, I mean I think we're probably way safer than ever before, but we're also way more fucking paranoid.

Speaker 6:          01:43:20       Yes. We're taking into account shit that's happening to people that are impossibly far away. Yeah, exactly. They actually agree 100% and you know, it's, it's all one of the safest times to be. It's certainly be American live here in the first world. And yet, you know, reporting, being human nature, we're drawn to scary stories and we're drawn to the shark attack. Even though you know, you're much more look to get fat and die of diabetes that you know, that's what's going to get you a car accident. But you're worried about sharks. Well, I think our biggest fear today, the most likely fear is human sabotage. And what by by human sabotage, I mean like man created issues like car accidents or drugs or, or, or, you know, things along those lines. Like, do you know how many fucking people that I've talked to who have kids that are hooked on pills?

Speaker 6:          01:44:12       Right? I mean apparently in high schools today it is a big shuttle in is like drug dealing. Ritalin is like a whole and Adderall is a big one. Oxycontin's are big. I heard about a lot of writers use it. Yeah. Adderall to write their stuff like screenplays and stuff. I hear the screenwriters to it and here's the danger to that, which I think my ex lane what's happening. But there's um, Jonah Lehrer wrote that book called imagine about how innovation works and he's been, you know, he's the guy who got discredited cause he made up Bob Dylan quotes. He did. Oh yeah, I heard about that totally. Yet he got, but the book is actually not bad and that it was too bad that he do that. It's not even interesting. Like, it's not even the good part of the book. I don't know what, what happened?

Speaker 6:          01:44:54       I think he's pretty arrogant dude. But the um, the, the, the, the thing about innovation is it like caffeine hurts her innovation. Adderall hurts your innovation. Like it helps you focus, but you innovation needs to be broad with your mind. That's why it happens in the shower. That's what happens in your own walks or you're kind of spacing out. You got, and you made me tired sometimes. Yeah. Your brain makes a connection. It wouldn't have made otherwise. It's reaching through your all your experience and it's going, oh look at this would have worked if you just thought of it. But you can't when you're on Adderall and cat, even caffeine, you can't do that because you're focusing focusing. Right. That's why coke people are so hard to talk to. Yeah. Certainly. Specific Coke people and some people they don't, they're not like abstract or fascinating at all.

Speaker 6:          01:45:41       They're just real linear and obvious and repetitive and boring and you're like, Oh man, get me out of this. Well, some people I do find with coke, like they feel like they're the king of the world and that's the people that you have to watch out. And Caffeine can also have that same sort of euphoric chatterbox. It's why I love it. Yeah. I love coffee, caffeine. But I think that as far as like stimulants go, that's probably as far as I'm going to push it. I've dabbled with the idea of trying Adderall but never jumped in. And it just seems to me be a little fucking iffy. Well, I heard about these guys, I'm like, well that sounds great. And then I read this and I'm like, Oh yeah, you can't do that. You know, like it's, it's like the monkeys, Paul, right? Like there's a, there's a price you pay for the thing.

Speaker 6:          01:46:21       Tim Ferriss calls it the biological free lunch. She says there's no biological on free lunch. Whenever you have something that has like a very powerful action, there's going to be an equal reaction. Yeah. And what he was talking about was, um, um, a think called provigil. Have you heard a provisional? Yes, but tell me what it is. I've heard of it, but tell me it's a smart drug that a lot of the sort of a silicon valley dudes apparently are on because it's doesn't seem to have a discernible side effect for some folks. Some people get rashes and some people biologically it doesn't jive for them. But for other folks it's like, it's like martyr, it's fucking super pill. Right. Super Cool. It makes you like, like super energize. Your mind works really clear but it's not speed, but it's real sketchy. Like Whoa, why did we price?

Speaker 6:          01:47:09       Yeah, I've done it a couple of times and every time I do and I'm like, man, what is going on with this stuff? It's fucking super strong man. Really? Yeah, it's really powerful. Like I took a half a pill and it lasts for like six hours. And your aunt did a weird way to, cause you're not amped like a a guy like you talked too jacked up on coffee. Yeah. It's great if you have to drive, if you have to drive like I, I won't hesitate to take it. If I'm in a four hour drive and you know, I'm worried about sleeping at the wheel because you will not sleep at the wheel if you take this stuff right, if it jives with your biology. But it's a tricky one. Like a lot of people that doesn't jive with their biology.

Speaker 6:          01:47:47       I wanted to get out, I want to get a prescription for it so bad. It's just because I have to do so many times where I'm just really tired. You know, I'm working these studs the Lord too. Even from coke like you're like, ah, this part, it would be fun if I was awake. Have you ever tried Kat? Do you know what that stuff that's stimulant that those Somali pirates trying Somali pirates are doing it. I'm doing me, they seem like rational fellows. Good idea. Good grip on reality. It's going to work out and I like their shoes. Yeah, the Somali pirates a, that's one of the things that they, uh, the issue is that they're jacked up on this and fit amine plant. Right. This is African amphetamines, Africa, where it was like, this red is going around then you know, like he, I like sheep.

Speaker 6:          01:48:32       It's real cheap and South Africa, the life course. So it was life. Right. You hear about that guy with no legs are shot. His girlfriend, his story is South African Guy, the sprinter, the Olympic sprinter. I love his name, his story. It's because it's like the most Afrikaans, like Dutch name Pastorius and he's from notorious, oh, that's funny. It many a apparently constantly he thought it was she, they thought he mistook her for a burglar at first, but then they realize no, no, he just fucking wigged out and shut us out. South Africa. No, never. I was in, so I sailed across the Indian Ocean and then I quit this job and I got off in South Africa, Australia. What was after I'd been living in Thailand, right. And fighting and I went back to Australia. I got on a boat. What to uh, across the Indian Ocean, doing what is working, what kind of job.

Speaker 6:          01:49:19       But it was it a mate, a friend of mine was taking his little 38 foot Hans Christian with his girlfriend who was a friend of mine. Uh, so it was the three of us for five months across God. But one of the things you never really seen when you're saying them like that, you don't really see anybody because you're sleeping. He's up and then he's sleeping Europe. You know what I mean? It's not like you're put the three of you were on a boat for five months. Yeah, yeah. Oh my God. Five months. Just you were the only people you saw? No, no. We got off a couple. We had stopped like three or four times. Right. So

Speaker 5:          01:49:47       I stopped it like Maricia said reunion. So you may go a month with all 20 days, something like that. What did you eat with food? We brought food, tons of canned food and gets fish. But yeah, tons of canned food and stuff and rice and whatever water. Uh, yeah, it was fun. And you couldn't handle it though. When you went to got to South Carolina, I was ready to get the fuck out of there. So we hit Durban and I quit and I bummed around South Africa for, I don't know, maybe six months, tease us dude. And here Trey, Indiana. Yeah. You're always going to places that you could die real easy from bugs. Right. Where was I? What was that story and the story from people being separated? Oh no it how dangerous South Africa. It's crazy because like this girl who became my friend who sort of like adopted me for some reason a Durban, um, she had all these scars because, uh, she has guard dogs, you know, cause it's, you know, it's dangerous place.

Speaker 5:          01:50:46       They had guard dogs and the maid came in the wrong door on the wrong day and the dogs killed the Guy Dave made and she was in there fighting the dogs trying to pull in the black made these dogs are trained to attack black people and she got shredded and the dogs killed the maid. And that was like, oh yeah, that's what happened. And it, it'll night you drive around, you run red lights, you don't stop. Oh my God. So he was just worried about getting caught. Yeah. You just don't do it. Yeah. How much more dangerous or South Africa then? Like Detroit, um, you towards getting there. Right. I don't know. I've met in Detroit and just like decide the color scale you have for stress was like the South Africa scale. Yeah. I went to a close here to South Africa. I went to Panama and Panama City and then apparently that's like co Cologne.

Speaker 5:          01:51:30       It's apparently really dangerous and it was bad, but as long as you kept moving, it was all right. It was the kind of thing where if you stayed, you would have gotten jumped. We uh, we had, uh, one of the guys from a vice on that said that the Karachi a bad, apparently Shane Smith, who's the head of Vice Awesome Guy, we've had them on a few times. I love, love that guy. He's amazing. He's been all over the world. But he said Karachi, he said, your life's worth about 20 bucks, right. You can hire a hit man. To kill you for 20 bucks. I can't be on the street. Millions of people. And they pull up and just shoot people and just hop on their mind. It's in Pakistan, Karachi and Pakistan. Yeah. Let me see. All rightey Pakistan. Yeah. I never really did. I mean, anyway, yeah, a lot of, but you know, most, a lot of towns in Pakistan, in Africa, you know, after dark, dangerous after dark.

Speaker 5:          01:52:21       When we look at our life that we have today in society, I mean, look at us living here in Los Angeles, the greater Los Angeles area. It's so Goddamn cushy compared to some spots in the world and what it used to be too. Like, you know, like we're talking about, you know, what you're come from, what you would have been normally dealing with and it's just, you're never hungry. You never cold food is five minutes away. Like if the apocalypse comes or the people in the Congo gonna even know. Yeah. Right, right. You're going to operate as you. Has Anything changed? No. One I did. So at part of the book I went up to the Inuit up in, uh, in um, northern Canada. Oh, did the Igloo and the sea ice and stuff like that. And again, if the apocalypse comes like, yeah, they'll notice because they'll be gas, you know, after a year or two that were on the gas and they'll be back to their sled dogs, you know.

Speaker 5:          01:53:11       But other than that, they're fine. What did you do with the it up then? I did, um, I just bummed around for a couple of weeks and did old thing, go somewhere and fuck off for a couple of months. Well, I would've gone on for longer, but now I have a kid. I don't do it anymore, but uh, but uh, you know, I did this, see I smell. So I did like built an Igloo. I did a little sled dogging and did some of this stuff, which is, which was totally fun. Now when you build an Igloo, how comfortable, I mean, how hold was about outside and how comfortable is it actually inside the Igloo? It's still pretty cold. I mean, you know, in your, you would have to raise up your bed a little bit cause otherwise you melt into the ice, you put branches down or something. One of the things about surviving really cold is like conduction.

Speaker 5:          01:53:52       So touching things will suck heat out of you. So if you could, you've got to get off the ground and puts something between you and the ground or you know, really worn boots have, haven't really fixed soul to keep your feet off the nose. Okay. No right snow Kim. It has kinda insulate but you still don't want to be touching it cause you'll melt into it. Your body a warmer, nothing, nothing too. And then they get you wet and wet will kill you, you know. So inside the Igloo, I think it would be like a round zero degrees. Wow. Or a little bit below, but, but um, you know, outside of this 20, 30 below and there's no vegans in the annual communities, it's almost all hunter know, gather. I mean, they eat, they just hunt the hunter [inaudible] I said you have to, right? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:54:33       And they don't, they get supplied by the Canadian government now and they, they, they're kind of been forced into towns. It's actually really depressing because there's, you know, there's no roads. They had the Internet, um, but there's no road. So they plan tickets like four grand to fly to Montreal so that these kids grow up there and they, you know, this town's 1200 people and they have MTV and they have the Internet and then they get movies and stuff, but they really can't leave, you know, it's very, very hard to make enough money to leave. And so there's a lot of, you know, it's in it's native American community. So there's what traditionally those problems are alcoholism and all those, you know, you know, not being a part of the culture and all that stuff. And what is the main foe occupation there? They do, you know, there's, there's some mining s support stuff and exploration support stuff. There's some tourism stuff, you know, people go up there and do trips. Um, and then there's hunting and gathering. You know, there's, so do they sell this is they do some crafts and stuff like that and they do carve, carve and, and uh, sell furs probably, you know, they're allowed to hunt anything. I think whales are the, they have a limit on the whale quarter they can take, but they hunt polar bear and they hunt

Speaker 6:          01:55:44       seals. Polar bear. Yeah. I didn't get to, but yeah, they do polar bears. And then we, we got a Caribou while I was there, you know, but I didn't get to do it. But they, uh, they have, they like to play. They're like, you know, they, they stock the land like death. I mean, they just kill everything because it's not my stair. Well, and this guy, he's 60, he was born in the Igloo. Wow. He has this born in England, right. Has the stories about his mom having to kill a dog to survive because they were, they were starving. So, you know, he comes directly from absolute survival, starvation, the edge of it, you know. And so of course they kill, you know, more than they need. And they put it in a storage for the village. I guess things don't get bad because it's zero degrees outside, so he'd just have a hole in the ground.

Speaker 6:          01:56:28       That's the huge advantage is that you live in a freezer and they, you know what Eskimo means? It means people who eat raw meat in the, in the Indian language. Is it a, a s instead of a slur, the word as kind of a little bit, it's, they call themselves the, into it. And it would just means that it's not like Spec. It's not that bad, but it's, it's, you're uneducated if you call them that, like Jap. Yes. I don't even know. I can't just that the record. And he's like, there's a spectrum, you know, like with obviously nigger being the worst ones, except for black people when they throw it around and each other, that's fine, you know, then it's fine or rappers or whatever. Or Quintin Tarantino. But if you, uh, you go from that to like Guinea, like Italians, we'll call each other guineas and it's not that big a deal.

Speaker 6:          01:57:11       It's like it does it. Cracker, cracker six kind of add but not that like actually it can have a sense of an endearment to it, but cracker doesn't really, I guess so maybe crackers worse than getting on, but they're not that effective. Well and always ask him, oh, in that line. I Dunno. I Dunno. I don't think it's maybe even it's milder than that cause there is like a logistic logical historical. So the Indians when they were introducing, um, the French to these people, they're like, oh, they're the people who eat raw meat. Eskimo is the, in the, uh, cro language or something like that. So they, why is that bad that this is, this doesn't seem like they call themselves. Right. Okay. So it's not that bad, but they just don't, they, they, I always thought that if you used the word and you wait, you were an asshole.

Speaker 6:          01:57:53       I was just trying too hard. Oh really? At the end you'd people shut up. They do a lot of throwback Eskimos. You fuck, but I didn't know. Then someone told me that Eskimos a slur and I was like, oh, okay. But we're getting to the point where pretty much everything's a slur getting, you know, did you see the guy who was the head of um, uh, Bravo had to apologize for using the word twink? No. Yes. And he's gay. Let's twink mean twinks a weird gay guy. Like a skinny gay guy. Looks like a, like a little boy. The calm twinks. Really? Yeah. He had to apologize for using the twic cause apparently damage the twinks got offended. So sensitive. And again, I think a lot of that, this sensitivity, this ridiculous over. Yeah. It's because of the fact that we're not dealing with real survival issues. So we look for things to bicker about. Yeah. Know you think about sports, like entirely sports. It's like

Speaker 5:          01:58:41       because you don't have survival concerns. Yes. So you watch, I mean, I always think about it like you watch other men to sort of, you know, because of the caveman thing and see, do I want that guy hunting with me? Don't want them with me. But that's the whole thing. It's like we're addicted to watch it. It touches everybody. We all have a genetic predilection to watch men do shit because it's got a survival, you know, impetus. And yet, you know, that's all it is. It's like, and it's like a, it's sort of absurd, you know? And yet it's, it's, it's, you know, it's the biggest thing in the world.

Speaker 6:          01:59:17       It's sort of observed, but yet it's also sort of natural that it's this kind of bridge between our civilization and our ancient history. Yeah. It's really strange prowess. Yeah. It keeps us active. It keeps us in the mix, which is observing, gauging, you know? Yeah. Common Russian. Yeah. Gauging domination and caging. There's a chart and what we value, it's very strange. It is. What's really strange is that if you look at it as a pattern, as you said, you know about the, our modern civilization. If you looked at the book of the history of the world, our modern civilization is like a one sentence. A couple of paragraphs. Yeah. And if you look at where we're going and you see this, this sort of, these trains trends, and look at us as hunter gatherers 10,000 years ago, look at us as, or you know, wherever it was in history, and look at us today and look at what is 10,000 years from now.

Speaker 6:          02:00:12       It's uh, it's impossible to gauge. It's too confusing. It's too alien. And there's a lot of people that hate sports. There's a lot of people that hate jocks and meatheads and the whole idea of the male dominator culture. That's sort of this leftover thing. But what is the alternative? Because I wonder what are I going to do? Are we going to be, the alternative is very, it's, it's very confusing when you're talking about synthetic skin and the ability to recreate brain cells in, in, in, in, in a laboratory up. Yeah. I mean, what do they, what are they trying to meet? They're going to make another tronic brain. They're going to make electronic bulletproof brain when computers, when artificial intelligence is start building art, other artificial intelligence, all that stuff you'll all off on you don't get crazy. They see that that's the big worry is not the invention of the artificial intelligence.

Speaker 6:          02:01:05       It's what the artificial intelligence does. It becomes sentience, is that it will improve upon the design that are fucking measly brains have created and improve upon it. 10,000 years worth of evolution and then a couple of weeks they'll just have the apocalypse robo apocalypse. Did you and I will still give me a blurb. He liked the book. Ah, he's awesome. Oh, unfortunately Steven Spielberg decided to not do that. Is that what happened? And do some other fucking stupid piece of shit movie that no one's going to like about a dog. No, no, no. What did he just do? What's his last name? I guess robot apocalypse also. You worry about like it's cool to sort of a very I robotic in theory. Yeah. Was it was, it was interesting. I mean I think Daniel Watson is a really interesting robotic wise. You mean storywise? Yeah, that's good. I hadn't read it.

Speaker 6:          02:01:53       We've had him on the podcast, so it was really cool. So I was rooting for him. And then when I found out that they, Steven Spielberg cancel production in the Bronx, I assumed it was because it was too good. I assumed that that was a point where, yeah, Spielberg is a weird cat now. Yeah. Everything is four acts. You're like, all right. Yeah. Yeah. Well I think a lot of those older dudes that George Lucas type guys, they get so much money and so much they hit the spot where they made a million awesome movies and then it just is a little patty. Is it theory? As my wife has a isn't it makes movies and one of her theories is, uh, it kill you. You kill yourself to make something really, really good. It, you just kill yourself, right? You sacrifice your family and your, your health and everything and then you sorta don't want to do it again.

Speaker 6:          02:02:39       And then, so you kind kinda do a little bit less and everyone's still like, oh, that was amazing. And you're like, nobody fucking noticed that I didn't kill myself, so I'm going to keep doing it. You know? And then you start phoning it in because you're like, I want to have a regular life. I want to work eight hours a day or 10 you know, I don't want to work 15 hours a day for 300 days and not have a life. Again. I think there's that motivation to push you. Especially I think in the world of movies, I think that's probably one of the most difficult endeavors to make a giant blockbuster film. Like to make an Avatar. Like here's a guy that was telling me about James Cameron and he was like, like Oh James Cameron such a Douche bag. Like I had to work with them on this movie.

Speaker 6:          02:03:18       He's such a con. And I was like thinking about like how lazy this guy is, how annoying it probably be having this guy worked for you when you're a guy like James counter percent. I'm going to make after talk everybody. Yeah I'm making this, we're doing it my way. We're going to do this because I know you don't know why cause you don't know what's going on. And everyone's like, oh he's so hard to work with. Yeah. Cause he's trying to do something amazing. Like, you know what I mean? And that's what it takes and it's, it's I 100% agree. Like people, I mean that guy has a stud, dude, Cameron is a stud. He's a bad motherfucker, made so many awesome movies. So he, yeah, he basically, you know, and you have to have that and you have, people are like, could you, cause people want to do the easiest thing.

Speaker 6:          02:04:00       So like, you know, they're like, oh, it makes you feel good enough. It's good. It's really good. See, his intensity only exists when it's your idea. You don't have that intensity when you're working for somebody. You just don't, you know, the, that's when it's your baby. That's when it's your life, when it's everything. Otherwise you just maybe hit eight and he's at 10 you might get a seven, you're not going to get 10 and he not going to want to pay that price. And that fucking guy wakes up or running at 10 you know, and you're like, oh Jesus now has an asshole to work for. Yeah, of course. Like he's trying to do something good and I'm just guessing, maybe he is an asshole. The fuck. Do I know somebody listening to this man? No, no, no, no, no. Two shads an asshole. He told me to repaint the entire side of the boat.

Speaker 6:          02:04:42       It was the wrong color. Gray. Who cares about taught me, this is a ridiculous, but like Tom Cruise gets the wrong sandwich and he threw it at the guy, the assistant and everyone's like, Tom Cruise is such a dick. It's like dude, I'm carrying this $150 million movie. You're job is to get me the right fucking sandwich and you're not doing it. Like you know what I mean? Like go get the wrong sandwich too. Like it's all you have to do today is bring Tom Cruise that right. Sam, I don't need any fucking confusion here. I'm Tom Cruise. I'm trying to do, should have a lot of shit going on here, man. Scientology and my sexuality. Sandwich confusion. Do your job. So I know, I feel like that's a lot of times you hear that about people and it's like, cause it's also, again, it goes back to what we were talking about earlier, it's like this is artificial stress and we've sort of created the end of the day, it's just a piece of entertainment.

Speaker 6:          02:05:30       It's a fucking movie. Okay. It's not running from a tiger. It's a movie. Goddammit. No one should die making a movie. Exactly. Yeah. Do you follow the walking dead? You follow? Like I don't follow it. I know, I know a little bit about comic books. Oh yeah. World War. He was like one of my favorite books. So, and that it so funny it was pitching this book. I was like, yeah, I'm gonna do this. And they all like, and all these New Yorker, this is, you know, before walking dead comes out and they're all like, zombies, nobody's gonna read this. You're crazy now. Zombies are everywhere. No, there's Zombie porn now. Oh, I'm not surprised. There's CGI porn that people are creating and that is so close to like, it's like, it's pretty obvious that it's not really people, but it looks enough like real people that you could beat off to it.

Speaker 6:          02:06:18       I mean, you're not going to get confused, but there's some porn where it leads the way and a lot of things. Technology, fucking monsters banging chicks with their big monster dicks. And you're like, who is this? The Japanese Japanese with Japanese. It's an American Pankaj there's a, there's this weird sort of a Zombie thing that's going on. Well they have a, there's a movie now like a twilight. What does chicken falls in love with the Zombie yet? Well, you've got to the point that with the Zombie genre you're getting into, like you have to fizzling out. Awesome. Yeah. You have to do the next thing, right? Which is like when does the unforgiven of theirs? Like I always feel like unforgiven kind of like ended the western in a way. You know, like it's, it's like the Uber most perfect western ever made. It's one of my favorite movies of all time me to be the best movie ever made.

Speaker 6:          02:07:04       But it's like, what's the western? You can't do it western anymore. It's really hard. Like you'd make fun of Westerns or you do it satirically or, and I feel like there's Zombie genres. It's headed that way. And you know, I have a friend who's making World War z with Brad Pitt and I'm real curious to see how that comes in. What happens. I am legend. Uh, no, I, I, you know, I think the CG zombies heard it. Yeah. Guys in Zombie costumes are much scarier than CG zombies. That's interesting. Yeah. I see what you mean. Yeah. They love the, with their mouths open and it was pretty obviously a little fast and yeah, something about it that doesn't quite read where Eva, did you see the gray? Yes. Like I think if it had been real wolves, I would have been more scared. Really? Yeah. I Dunno.

Speaker 6:          02:07:50       They looked pretty real. Did you liked it? Thought they looked real hard. I thought the behavior that they exhibited is not really, the bowls are much more concerned with survival and that, you know, if they'd lost a few wolves to these people, they probably steer clear. They wouldn't hunt them and dramatic pace of the movie. Yeah, this and that. But the way they were separating them from other people, you know, but I thought I was like, man, that's a little clever. But I guess I guess what they're doing is they're making something fiction and I'm willing to, yeah, yeah. Go on the ride. Yeah. I'm willing to go on that ride. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:08:21       Mommy wrote the gay off on opion Anthony this week. Joe, what it gay off on the Anthony Opie and Anthony this week? Yeah. No. What are you talking to? You got to download. You can download off audible. It was like last Wednesday I think it was. They had a gay off the first annual gay off Andrew Dice Clay is in studio and what they do is they take four married guys. They bring their wives and these guys are like, haven't done gay stuff before ever and they have to do gay stuff in front of their wise to try to win $1,200 and it got to the point where they ended up bringing like this guy from Craig's list and that was a gay escort or something like that. I can't remember that. A dancer and at 1.1 guy's like jacking him off with oil while making out with him. The other guy's putting his nose on his ass hole and it was, it was some of the most funniest shit I've ever heard.

Speaker 3:          02:09:12       Andrew dice clay lasted like 10 minutes in it. Like he got to the point where they were tickling each other. He goes, oh this is pretty good. And then like the next one was like something like LDF at mouth kiss. He's like, I'm Outta here. He just left. I love your dice. Oppression. Terrible. It's like a combination of bum delouis and dice. And that's another thing I is Opi does. If you listened to any episode that Andrew Dice Clay is in studio opiate has this, I'm moving here now. Kind of like, like kind of like a commentary Tina with black people. It's a little east coast on them. It comes out really bad. Well it's fun to talk like dice. Yeah. Oh,

Speaker 6:          02:09:49       you know when you have Dyson and whenever we have minutes, it's almost contagious. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Um, I don't know if I want to be in the room, I dudes at Jack and dudes off a mouth kissing. I'd want to just give them the tickets or whatever the fuck they're getting. What do they, what would they be?

Speaker 3:          02:10:03       It was only like $1,200 and they got to the point though where it got so horrible that their wives were, yeah. The two guys tapped out and the other two were like, I'm in it to deal with that. Most of them were like, this is hilarious. This is funny. A couple of 'em got creeped out like I've never even seen porn before. And then I see my husband do it and all right, the clear the palate. Have you seen this though? The happy elephant? What this is, I've seen, it's like one of the best videos ever. I go, if you go onto youtube and look at it, it's just an elephant that's having fun in the ocean and it's like charging

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       waves and it's like, it's like he's just having the time of his life. It is it just a super positive

Speaker 1:          02:10:41       animal because they're really intelligent and they have an amazing memory. You know, always people, they make that sort of a connection to elephants and memories. But you know, because one of the ways to train an elephant as you tie them to a something to their leg and you put a stake in the ground when they're young and they don't have any strength and they always remember that they can't move that steak. So even though they get big and they're much stronger, they can easily pull free. They don't because they sort of remember that. But they've done these, a reintroductions of elephants that haven't seen each other for over 20 years and they go crazy. They run rug and grab each other. They recognize each other right away. Even though the US fucking elephants all basically look the same.

Speaker 5:          02:11:24       Totally speciesist end because they ended up shooting it cause it was on a resort. You Imagine Ted Nugent comes out riding a buffalo and puts one in the silence.

Speaker 1:          02:11:37       Yeah. I watched his, one of his, uh, hunting shows where you shot an elephant. And I'm like, wow, really? Dude. And they were talking about how it's important to shoot elephants because there's too many of them now. Yeah. Cause, uh,

Speaker 5:          02:11:49       they're destructive to the environment and they're crowded out. Yeah. They have to call the herd. They do. Nobody wants to hear that though. You know? I know it's tough,

Speaker 1:          02:11:56       dear thing too. Like I've had conversation with people, but deer and, uh, they're like, well, I don't think I could ever shoot a deer. And I don't think I support hunting because you could always just like, listen, we're raising cattle for food. You should just see cattle. Okay. But they gonna fuck those deer going to fuck.

Speaker 5:          02:12:12       And then what happens? Well, you know, we're raising every lane. Basically, we're raising everything. You know, we're raising deer to, you know, just a little more indirectly. Yeah. And certainly like the, you know, the elk population out did some elk hunting in Colorado for the book and that, you know, you have to kill, you know, killing females is, there's more females in math, like a lot more. So they need, they're trying to keep the herd and balance and it's important what you really should do if you're going hunting is killed babies. Whoa. Because they might not survive the winter anyway and that meets just going to waste. They're rotting in that. So use your tag. It's really, that's really hard to do. But kill Bambi. Right. That's the, that's the real tough one. That's what you should do. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:12:52       Again, on the Ted Nugent saw or some he, cause he would bow and Arrow hunts and I don't know like what limits, there are tagged limits, but he shot three deer in a day. I Dunno. Thought maybe it's on his own property. It is on his own property. I don't know. But I guess he's, maybe he's doing, you know,

Speaker 5:          02:13:07       like a population management. So one of them was like this little baby, they jack with a polling out. I'm like, whoa. Yeah. Actually bowhunting somebody I'd like to get into because it's so hard and not deer, not like sitting in a stand, which is a lot of deer hunting, but like elk hunting, which is you have to pursue, you have to like track, you'd have to like close. I'll shoot it with 15 2030 yards, you know, as opposed to, you know, a hundred, 200 yards

Speaker 6:          02:13:33       and you got to do it most of the time by herself. Right. And the guide who can close now it's more sense you're making a mess, you know, so your, your survival, your chances are more better than more people you like. That's why it's really hard to watch elk bow hunting on TV. Cause you've got to have a camera man. They're fucking everything up. Cameron stomping on twigs and shit about the new guy. That was my dog. Snap and the phone goes off, ears pop up and it's like, fuck this, I'm out of here man. Yeah. Elk is a gigantic animals. I don't think a lot of people realize how big they are, but there was, um, a lodge that we stayed in and, uh, they had an elk head on the wall and the horns, they're longer than my arm. I mean, literally it's, this thing was massive, like a 12, 1300 pound animal. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:14:22       I, you know, I got a female elk for this book and she was 600 pounds and it was, yeah, it was, was Christ 600 pounds. How much we meet was that, you know, it was, I dunno, I think I had brought home, I don't know, I didn't let you know, but a lot. Yeah. Three, 400, you know, I don't know. At that point I want you to be 300, 250 pounds of meat. Did you stalk it? Like how did you, yeah, yeah, he hit the, you have to like basically elk hunting and where I wasn't southern Colorado, you have to look essentially run. Like it's because, uh, there are only coming out at a very specific time and, uh, your scent is so destructive to the they'll, they'll take there, they smell you at all. They're going to be, they're going to take off and never come back.

Speaker 5:          02:15:02       So you don't go out and told their out. You don't like go wait for him, which is what, you know, like deer hunting is more, you get in a blind and wait for him that you actually look where they are and go up and sneak around and you know, I can run through the bushes taking into account where the wind's blowing and he tried to hunt, hunt the wind. So you have the wind blown with you. And uh, and uh, yeah, I uh, I was with Don Yeager who is chuck Yeager son Chuck Yeager's, like the fighter fighter pilot, the rope, the speed of sound iconic. Wow. Um, whose was it? Bigger? So Don Yeager who was a Vietnam vet, it was a appointment in Vietnam. Um, and uh, we've become friends, long story, that whole thing. But he and his son, his son is like a big hunter.

Speaker 5:          02:15:51       And also, uh, uh, uh, Iraq and Afghanistan vet. Wow. And, you know, they were in the, in the trenches, vets not all told. How many different experiences did you go through to write this book? I don't know. 10 something like that. You know. So I did, I tried what I tried to do with sort of, you know, have fun with it and keep it light and in interesting and not dire and sincere and sort of answer all your survival scenario needs. Like what if it's Mad Max? Well, I did a stunt driving school, you know, and I'm like, what are some of the things about stunt driving you didn't know? Like, you know, you fixed the brakes so you can pump the brake. So getting the rear to lock is how you do all those tricks. So how you bust a one 80 and all that stuff is by pumping the brake and they fix it so you can pump it like a break or you know, even the one that you step on.

Speaker 5:          02:16:39       And, um, and then, you know, I did stuff like I stole a kind of learned how to steal old cars with la La Gangbangers, loose cars, you know, and you know, you can't steal anything recent, recent, you know, but older cohort years, like a good year to start stealing, you know, and like, you know, a 93 civics. Great. You know what I mean? Yeah. You just go in MPs. Yeah. Pop off all the, all of us basically you pop off the stuff from the steering column and you reach in there with like a leatherman and we're, or needle nose and just, it turns out key really is that easy. Yeah. And then you sign it for GM cars. He's size, which I missed something in the column, but you know, anything after, you know, they have like electronic fail safes and shut offs and chips in the keys and stuff like that.

Speaker 5:          02:17:22       Did this book writing this book changed the way you live your life? Yeah, little, I learned a lot. I mean, it was just so much stuff I didn't, I was just stunned, you know? And it really became like mythbusters for a lot of things. You know, things I thought were true weren't true, like about what I thought it'd be able to do or what the realities of certain situations were. What was the most shocking? Probably the stress when really was the most mind blowing and really changed the way I think about myself, you know, and what I can do, why can't do and, but you know, there was, I don't even know, you know this, it's just, it all goes into the mix of like, you know, trying to understand the world, you know, which is what basically what I'm trying to do.

Speaker 6:          02:18:01       One of the things that I've thought was really fascinating was that this book, a lot of it seemed to emanate from where you grew up and you grow up in a town in Massachusetts. It explained the story that they were attacked by the Indians. Hatchet marks on the fucking houses still

Speaker 5:          02:18:20       there. Right. So I grew up in a town called old Deerfield mass, which is like a little bit like Sturbridge, like it's partial, half the town is his museum. And because it was very famously at 17, oh four, the Indians and French, uh, came down from Canada and massacred the whole town and marched off 150 captives in the winter all the way up to Canada. And, you know, a lot of them made it and it was crazy, but, um, people were tough. You know, it's again, like you can't even compare the toughness from 1702 to now, you know, but, but, uh, but yeah, and so I grew up in this town where, you know, there were a lot of, the Indians had to act a whole and the store and shot the guy through the door. And, you know, these stories are kind of what I grew up with and they'd even do recreation's as a kid.

Speaker 5:          02:19:05       I remember like, you know, guys as Indians are screaming in the night running around and killing other people that were dressed as colonials, you know, and like when you're in a recreation in a recreation, but when you're like, you know, five years old, that shit sticks. You know what I mean? That goes deep. So like, I think I definitely, I kind of realized in this book that I was like, kind of preparing for the Indians to come over the wall and certain with my whole life, you know what I mean? With like, you know, with the fighting stuff and with, uh, with everything, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:19:36       Yeah. I loved that. That realization that you had in the book, I thought, I found it really fascinating and I just couldn't imagine what it must be like growing up in a town where there's real clear evidence of the hatchet marks on doors and shit. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:19:50       Yeah. I mean, you knew it was, it was a long time. It was right, but still is a little kid. You're like, I would wake up and there was cornfields and I'd be like, are they come through the corn? Dude, I do like, you know, and that they came in the winter, you know, it was ridiculous, but you still, it gets into your, you know, these things. And again, you were simple animals. You know, you're afraid of things. You're not sophisticated on how you deal with your fear. You think you are and you see a movie about something, you believe it man. And like you can say, oh, it's just move. But you know what a big party you does not know. That's just a movie, a big party. You thinks huge sharks are in the water and they will always think that because the jaw, you know what I mean? There's a, there's a, there's a, there's a deceit that goes on when people all, it's just a movie. I'm not fooled, but you are fooled. Yeah. Sorta at some level. On some level you believe it's possible.

Speaker 1:          02:20:42       Yeah. On some level, yeah. It's um, the, the idea of living in a place where you knew massacres took place. Was Your town supposedly haunted?

Speaker 5:          02:20:52       Oh yeah. There we go. Surfing and stuff like that. I never dealt with any of them, but I had the people, I had friends who had that conversation. You believe in that? Yes. I've never seen it. Right. But I leave even like psychic energy and stuff like that. I mean, listen, I've been in places where I was in an island in the Pacific. Um, there was actually Malcolm Forbes, his private island, um, did, the guy was sailing with new, somehow we stayed there and it had been, um, it was a small island near not too far from Fiji and the Fijians had come in the night over a hundred years and eaten. Everybody on the island did declare war on this island and eaten everybody off the island. And you could tell like some shit had gone down there. I like, there was a quiet Erie bad juice there, you know, for sure.

Speaker 5:          02:21:43       And also like, you know, those towns because you knew or because there's no, maybe, maybe, I mean I could have been fooling myself, but it was also like, you know, the Anasazi ruins and anyone in New Mexico and stuff, like I felt the same quietness there that I kind of feel like there is, there's so much we don't know. I mean just know what you don't know. I mean that's kind of like my whole theory in life, but there's a lot of that's out there and I think there is psychic residue and things like, I mean people that go to Auschwitz talk about it, you know what I mean? And I've never been and I'm sure it would be something.

Speaker 1:          02:22:17       Yeah. I wonder because the issue was always a, you know, you're going to Auschwitz. Yeah. But it's, I, I mean I'm not, I'm not necessarily a skeptic as much. I am just always asking questions. But the, um, the psychic connection between people, I've heard like arguments about answering the phone. Like, do you know the no person's going to call you thinking about them and then they call you today. I was hanging around with a friend of mine and I was, I stepped, we opened this door and I had an a very obscure lyric playing in my head to a 1970 song. And this motherfucker behind me starts singing it and I go, why didn't you just sing that song? And he goes, it's a good song. I go, it's a good song. I go, why don't you just sing that song? It goes that songs in my head, I go, I was singing the fucking words to that song in my head before we walked through the door.

Speaker 1:          02:23:03       You said the exact lyric. I was thinking that could be easily coincidence, but God, I mean, it's a popular song and it's a famous song. There's things going on that you know, like it's, you know, there's brainwaves and energy. Yeah. But we get like a Sam Harris Dude in here who are like, oh, statistically it's like, are the possibilities, the probabilities and just luck and you're connecting all the significance to luck. And it might be bright too. I don't know. But man, it was freaking me out because I thought the exact words that this guy was singing behind me and they're from a fucking song written for decades ago. You know, it's like there's been a lot of songs between now and then. That's kind of crazy. So it give you,

Speaker 5:          02:23:41       yeah, no, I think there is a lot of forms of communication that, that, you know, emotionally, pheromones sense. You know what dogs are seeing with dogs are hitting off of, you know, the cat that comes in lies down on people two days before they die. You know, a creepy fucking cat. He's sucking your soul out result. Stupid knows there's smells you give off when you're going to whatever. But I think there's, there's just, you know, this more than to the Earth and heaven and hell are you?

Speaker 1:          02:24:07       Rupert Sheldrake believes that everything has some sort of a memory or he's got a theory about everything. Having some sort of a memory and that our ideas of memory are, you know, we think that memory is ours. We have a memory, animals have memory and that's it. But what, what he believes is that actual objects may also contain some sort of information about what's already taking place in that area. And that's one of the reasons why when you go to historic places, it gives you a strange feeling.

Speaker 5:          02:24:33       Well, that's what I'm talking about. Like, yeah, I'm not sure. I'm not sure it's impossible. Like if something really bad happened somewhere that you might pick it up later. I don't really know. I think it's, we're, I think we're more sensitive. You know, there's a great book, uh, Gavin de Becker wrote the gift of fear, which is all by intuition, you know, and you should trust your intuition in certain situations. You know, like, don't, if somebody's freaking you out, don't try to be nice to them. You know what I mean? Like there's, there's a reason maybe you don't see it and that right away, but don't force yourself to be polite. And anyway, it's a cool book.

Speaker 1:          02:25:04       I am a big believer in that. I don't know why, but maybe because of my own personal success with following that, that I've trusted my intuition like implicitly my entire life. Like that's the one thing that I've trusted my entire life that I don't think it's ever fucked me. Well, the danger is when you trust it for systems, it can't that

Speaker 5:          02:25:24       that are too big. Right? But you're never going to run into a 600 foot tall man on the, you know, that's never going to happen. But you could in the stock market, you know what you mean? You couldn't, you couldn't, in other situations where it's impossible to have a 600 that you're just not ready for. You know what I mean? Your intuition is not good. It's not designed for them. Something as complex as that system is just too big, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:25:45       Yeah. I think that's interesting because that's sort of along the lines of what we've been talking about is that our own bodies are not designed for this world. That we're living in the possibilities that are created by the suburb we live in. And your instincts, right? Sort of like plugged into something like the stock market. I've got a hunch, ah, you don't have shit.

Speaker 5:          02:26:00       You might be right, but you might be dealing with something that's impossible. And also, you know, guys who picks the machines that pick stock markets, stocks at random do fine. You know what I mean? They do just as good as most stock brokers, you know, so it's, you know, but, but, but your intuition is really good for personal relationships. You know, four things you would encounter on the plains of Africa. Right? Danger, you trust height, you know, why you're scared of heights, you know, certain situations. And you know, a lot of times they talk about, you're picking up a lot of silent cues or cues that are, your conscious mind is not picking up. Like, you know, the cop who, he knows something's going on and he, when he walks into the store and he's not remembering that he saw a guy sitting outside with the car running and cigarettes or something cute him to the fact that there's something hinky going on and you, maybe he missed it consciously, but subconsciously he's there.

Speaker 1:          02:26:53       You or the energy, he can feel the energy of someone who is trying not to get busted. I mean, who knows what vibe they're giving off. Yeah. It's the whole broad spectrum of senses is very strange because there's been certain studies that show that there are some intangible qualities then we can pick up on statistically like they've shown that people can tell when people are looking at the back of their head. Right. Yeah. More than 50%. It's like, it's statistically significant. Yeah. Get significant. Yeah. We talk about the hunters, gays, you know, we don't look at the animal, you know, until you're ready. Cause it can feel you. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:27:28       And, and dawn sometimes, and the snipers we'll talk about, like you, you have to look down and not only do, you have to not look at your target, you have to not think about it. You got to go blank. They have to go. I'm a log in the log in my log.

Speaker 1:          02:27:47       This is a fucking awesome book. I'm only three or four chapters in. Where am I at?

Speaker 5:          02:27:51       Tell you where I'm at. Um, uh, uh, uh,
