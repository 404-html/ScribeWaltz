Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience, I decided I try to work on this calmness and all that. And for me, driving and road rage was the worst. I used to have the worst road rage ever. Oh Dude, I was terrible man. You would not, you would not recognize me. I once got taken to the police station because someone accused me is this, this is a while back. But they accused me of a, exposing myself, we'll driving. Uh, and what the truth of the matters that someone cut me off and I got pissed off and I said, you don't want to, you, you know, Hong Kong Bobo here and uh, so uncommon Bobo here, you made a, you made a like a blow job, sort of a case against you. And I'm like, yeah, here you go. Write as a new hash. Exactly. Hong Kong. And he said to people while they were driving, no, no.

Speaker 1:          00:44          I just, I mean I made the, I made the, the, the graphical motion to have them blow you. Exactly. Yeah. Like basically, you know, blow me a few. And uh, so what did the same exactly. Anyway, I was kind of like, I'd forgot about it and this police officer leaves her business card on my front porch and apparently whoever cut me off was just a complete idiot of a driver and like really apparently thought I did this. So this, this little police officer, woman is like, Hey, uh, I know you at the beginning of a porno. I swear to God in the police station. She's like, I know, I know you did it. And I started laughing. I look for cameras. So I thought it was a joke. Like I thought some friends of mine had really seriously hooked me up on this because there's no way it was so far from my reality.

Speaker 1:          01:29          And she goes, no, I know you did. I have witnesses and I'm like, you can't have witnesses because it didn't happen like you're lying. And we went back and forth for two hours about this. This is how bad my road dredge was. Two hours she was full on, I'm going to go to the DA. I'm like, you can't go to the aid. There was no evidence. And furthermore, anatomically, okay, this is my lap, this is the side of the car and this is where the steering wheel is. So unless I'm like hung like a horse, it is not possible to drive and expose yourself at the same time to some in the car next to you. I'm like, you can't do that. So finally I did this lie detector test and I passed out. I volunteered to go. I'm like, I got, there's nothing going on here.

Speaker 1:          02:03          It was so good. Stopple I can't even tell you, but that's how bad my road rage was. Like no wait. He had to go to the station to get it light or did they have a lie detector? You're testing the car. She's got one. Oh No, this is bad. This is a month after it happened. Like I, Oh shit. It was scary actually. I was, I realized I was absolutely guilty. So many girls that have turned down the $25,000 offer from some king that just like just goes. It hits all the ladies like 25,000 week in there. But I know so many people that have turned it down, but I also know a couple girls that have done it and that's his fucking crazy. I think there's quite a few of those guys out there. Well, I've been to Dubai a number of times and there's $50 ones.

Speaker 1:          02:42          They're $50 for a prostitute. Yeah, but what I'm saying is that these guys that get girls from America and have them shipped, oh yeah. That to me, that's crazy shit. That kind of money. That's a way, this is a weird reality. You know when you have like trillions of dollars, like there's people who are like, I think as far as private wealth is concerned, like what we know and you see like the richest man in the world, man, not really. Okay. Because what you're getting is the richest man in the world who has assets that are measurable, like in the stock market. When you're dealing with canes, you don't have any fucking idea how much those guys have. You don't know. Why should you know? I got a buddy who, they have a bank. I got a buddy who's a billionaire, real live billionaire and uh, never knew he had money for years.

Speaker 1:          03:24          He was just, um, my friend's friend and uh, never knew. We hung out in New York and everything. And then one day I was reading about his family in the newspaper and I went, Holy Fuck. And I called him on the phone, I'm like, you have money? And he's like, yeah. I'm like, no, no, no. You have like fucking money. Family does. Yeah. And I said, this is bullshit. We have never gotten to take advantage of this. I said, you have like crazy fuck you money. So years later he came into the money like where it was his, oh, that's so creepy. Just sitting around lazy waiting for it to happen. We worked hard, but, but someone did die. I don't want to give away who we possibly is, but okay. But in one year he went from fucking Zenith, the Nadir, like he, he straight to rehab, like in the year end, a year from when he like took over the money to, he was, he would call me and be like, I'm in Vegas.

Speaker 1:          04:21          I got the top floor of the, when rented, I get slip and slides down the hallway. There's, there's strippers and hookers everywhere. And we got midgets in a storm trooper outfit serving the strengths and he'd be like, I'll have a private jet picking you up. Get here. Now how much money did he inherit? A bout $5 billion. Ooh. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. And he's not fun anymore. That's the best clip right there. He's not fun anymore. That's a complete ball changer. God Damn. He's not fun. $5 billion. It's the one guy that I, not fun because the rehab kind of killed it. Killed? No. You only needed a year before he went into Rehab. Yup. Wow. That's hilarious. And what was it for coke? He was smoking crack. Oh, the merits. Rancho freaks and Geeks. Lovers and children. What's going on?
