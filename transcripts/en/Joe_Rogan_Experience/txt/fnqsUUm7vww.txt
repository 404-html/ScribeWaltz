Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Ah,

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight. Got a fun new way to say that, Brian. I can't keep saying it that way. Back. This last slide is our sponsored. Okay. This is the deal folks. It's been very controversial, but they've been with us since the beginning and we are, uh, we are anything if loyal or loyal, if anything, loyal. If anything, we're loyal people. They've always been our sponsor. And even though it's a controversial subject, we, Brian and I both feel the controversy is very silly. What's the controversy? Controversy is being sponsored. That's Ari Shaffir lays gem and are the great.com being sponsored by a sex toy that it's, it's stupid. It's ridiculous. But I have to show is nonsense. This show we're talking about, we're talking about sex toys. We're talking about nonsense. It's not like there's this noble content that's continuously being brought up on the show and it doesn't deserve to be associated with something like a masturbation, do you mean?

Speaker 2:          00:01:00       Right. Does everybody must have to the fucking girls. It's so silly to me. I will never give it up. I won't give up the flush like, fuck you. You're ridiculous. They're paying us. They've always paid us. There's nothing wrong with what they're doing. If you think there's something wrong with what they're doing, you're crazy. If you don't want to be associated with them, good. That means you're a silly person. You're a silly person. What do you care? It's nonsense. We are known to have arguments like that. I'm always like, oh, let's not even talk. [inaudible] is ridiculous. Really pretending that we don't masturbate. Really? Why would you not you silly person. Have you ever pretended to masturbate? No. When you pretended yeah, like Ron Masturbate. Yeah. Who were you trying to fool? Will Brian, do you remember the time you were going to do that fucking movie and I talked to you out of doing it, man, I'm just going to do a film where they tied him up and a trunk of a car with his girlfriend and I was like, Yo, you don't want to have those videos out there, first of all, for people to get excited about what?

Speaker 2:          00:01:58       It's a very specific type of porn. It's like a, um, they want to see people that are kidnapped and they want to see people that are completely have fantasies of kidnapping people they don't like maybe. Yeah. And they don't, they don't really go through with it, but they want it like kidnap this guy front of them, you fucking piece of shit. I just allow guys to feel like that. So they make it was going to be a fuck film with you. Well don't you think of, that's true. Michael C. Hall was somewhere like, like shivering, crying, hiding, you know, the guy that played Dexter or somebody like that. You know, all these people that are serial killers all, yeah. Do you think that your have to think about that? That's, that is a real legit concern. I mean when you look, I'm not in any form or any way trying to say that we should have any, any kind of censorship in this world, but the reality is there's people that watch a show like Dexter and say, I would like to do that too.

Speaker 2:          00:02:47       Oh, have you seen my Twitter Avatar, Doug? I in Kennedy got arrested for doing the exact same fucking three's company to [inaudible] the guy even filming the people in the doing completely Dexter style and then, oh, they tried to copy it. Oh, he did do it. He did. He was inspired by Dexter, so he went out and killed a bunch of people. Oh really? Yeah. I tried to kill some bad people. If you see my Avatar, what's your Twitter? You would probably get really mad at me if you saw my Twitter avatar. Right Brian, where they were going to keep fucking this thing. What we're thinking of bucket fucking this thing or is it just a film? No, no. They were just going to kidnap us and like tie us up and, and then like going to do it for money. Yeah. It's acting. Yeah. Was actually seen that picture before.

Speaker 2:          00:03:28       Yeah. My heart's torn out and that, that's like gory. You know, there's blood dripping down my face picture forever. Yeah, it's gross. You should, uh, you should be careful of those things. It's, I mean, look, it is what it is. I mean, you're expressing yourself. You feel the need to express yourself getting murdered? Go ahead. Oh, that's what I think. There's a little something creepy about putting out videos of you getting tied up in your fucking truck. Cause it might 99.9% of the people. You're absolutely right. That's nothing that's not going to trigger anything weird. But there's that one 10th of 1% that just sees that and just thinks, I would like to fucking do that to him. Yeah. Well I'm glad you talked me out of it so I could torture my fleshlight like the one that killed the president cause of taxi driver.

Speaker 2:          00:04:12       Exactly. You can't really worry too much about crazy flux flashlights. A hell of a product. Torture you to fleshlight fucking strangle that. It was just before fuck stress. That was the best fleshlight commercial ever. If you're going to Joe rogan.net, click on the fleshlight link, entering the code name Brogan, you will get 15% off. How's that flashlights? Don't have hearts. They'd tell him, but don't be mean to fuck it all. It's just, it's a spiritual thing because people that are mean to them and that's what I get off on punching it. We're also brought to you by [inaudible] Dot com o n n I t, makers of Alpha brain, the cognitive enhancing supplement, new mood, the five serotonin enhancing supplement. We also have shroom tech, sport and immune. One of them is great for endurance. The other one is a little pumped me up for your immune system.

Speaker 2:          00:04:57       It's all explained on on a.com it's all stuff that I use and we use and it's all right. Now, today is Monday is the last day, March 19th until midnight. It's 35% off. If you just have a single 30 count bottles, if you just use the code on it or excuse me, try it, try it. So if you use the code t r y, I t just today, if you're listening on Ustream, iTunes, people probably mess this, but there's always 10% off every, every order. You can always use the code named Rogan and get 10% off and we stand by all this stuff. And it's also 100% money back guarantee on the first count of pills. So if you buy like a 30 count bottle, it's a 100% money back guarantee. You don't have to return the product. If you don't like it, you just say you get your money back.

Speaker 2:          00:05:45       We are, the most important thing is we are much more concerned with not having a bunch of people that feel like they got ripped off. Much more concerned with that then with making money. And it's all products that I use and I believe in, I've been a fan of nootropics and vitamins and minerals for a long time. And if you're interested in nootropics, it's an o, o, t, r, O, p, I, C S. And they're essentially nutrients that a stimulate brain function. They stimulate neurotransmitter's. It's, it's all fascinating stuff and it's very controversial. Uh, but I, uh, I've been a big supporter of it for awhile. So Google that go checkout nootropics, checkout on it. Oh and and it, and if you want to buy anything, use a code name. Rogan, get yourself 10% off our right freaks are either great. Is here

Speaker 3:          00:06:28       my pal Ari Shaffir ready to break shit. Damn. That was one of the greatest [inaudible] wait for that. I realize that's just music started. I'm like, Oh, I want to wait for that. Dan was the coolest shit ever when he did that in the middle of the fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:06:47       when he said that, I was like, wow, we just got the best commercial of all time. Nick Diaz throws his arms up in the air, says Joe Rogan got mad at me on Twitter recently for, for um, for uh, going against the suspension. We're talking ill of it. Really the B, well if folks don't know Nicky has get suspended or he's in the process of a hearing right now about as a use of marijuana, he only tested positive for the metabolites in his system. And I guess what his lawyer is arguing is that metabolites aren't illegal and that the marijuana is illegal and you're not, you're not allowed to have marijuana in your system. But you don't even have a law firm metabolite. Oh, I thought it was like metabolites only remnants. And the last time he was smoking when he got those remnants was when he was legally smoking.

Speaker 2:          00:07:30       But the state of California, the metabolite that actually was in his system is an inert metabolite. The metabolite that he tested positive for is not psychoactive. Oh. So the only thing that he tested positive for was a non psychoactive cannabinoid. There's, you know, I don't know how many cannabinoids, I shouldn't, I shouldn't talk about this until I talked to Todd McCarthy. Just let him smoke pot though. It's not a performance enhancing drug and it doesn't hurt the person. I get in this argument with people. I get in this argument with people. Um, and um, a lot of people have been angry at me about this because I've said that I think marijuana is a performance enhancing drug and it is, if you're good, if you're good with pot, and it is, if you're good with the martial arts, it is enhancing it and it's, it's, it's not necessarily enhancing.

Speaker 2:          00:08:16       Like you could give it to one guy and his emotions and his nerves and everything just because the fact that he's about to enter into a cage fight. It might overwhelm him and he might just lose his shit. But you could give it to like, I guarantee you you could give some weed to Bj Penn and he'd go out and fuck people up. Yeah, Bj Penn. I don't think he would have any problem with it. He's an old gene. You know what I mean? He's a veteran. You think he'd be better? I think the Jujitsu, those guys, those guys. Yeah, those guys never roll sober. You got to understand there's a lot of these guys like high level guys name any names because some people don't like people talking about it. So I'm going to tell. But high level Jujitsu guys that you've heard of [inaudible] videos and everybody like mimics them with their, their own game.

Speaker 2:          00:09:01       A lot of those guys smoke weed a lot. Like, it's a big picture and they smoke weed and train. You know, and look, I always go back to Eddie Bravo, you know, cause he's my best friend, but he's also one of the best Jujitsu instructors in the world. And I've never seen Eddie do Jujitsu when he wasn't high. It sometimes it gets so high, it's really teaching. It's like any, but he'll tell you, he'll tell me that it enhances him. He'll tell you that it enhances the sensitivity. It puts you in the flow better. It lets you, okay, but so does, so does, let's just say vitamin B or whatever else. They're very different though. Vitamin B is very good as far as your body's ability to perform. Yes. But not as far as being able to change your state. The idea that, well, the thing about marijuana is it's so, it's so euphoric and it's so mind expanding and it's, it's what it does when you have the fam.

Speaker 2:          00:09:51       This is by the way, is not for everybody. Obviously everybody's brain works in different ways, but with my personal experience, I get this wave of understanding when I get high and that prepares me for things. Man, that's one of the reasons why I like to get high. Before I do big giant shows. It slows everything down for me. I played poker tournaments, Huh? Yeah. Pool is fantastic. Hi. I play a ball better when I'm high. I really, yeah. That's another thing you'll say at a tournament, you'll see all the poker pros. You know you're wanting to do their cars at bricks isn't an enhancer. It is an enhancer. It just is. Do you think it affects your judgment though, to do stuff like, like in Jujitsu, like, I mean you watch a movie stoned and it, you might think it's awesome the next day. You think it sucks.

Speaker 2:          00:10:33       If you're doing Jujitsu with somebody or MMA, maybe you would do something you normally wouldn't do because you're thinking something different, you know? Well you could, but that could lead to Pepsi. What you're saying is like, hold on a second, but we, you're saying is that you would like make a big mistake. I think that what makes me stick, you'd just do something that you normally wouldn't do. Well that would be a positive though. A lot of times. As long as you're good again, as long as you're good. Because if you're a good Jujitsu player, if you're a good grappler and you have a fundamental understanding of where you're supposed to put yourself, where you're in danger, where you're not in danger, what can be done. You know there's all these moves tie into each other. You know when you learn how to do butterfly hooks, butterfly hooks, you know, you, you, you learn how to manipulate people's bodies, that that all of a sudden becomes a way to move people around just like with your hands.

Speaker 2:          00:11:23       And that adds to all these other techniques that you do. So there's like, there's, there's like literally in a limitless number of moves and positions. I mean there's so many different variations, so many different counters to those variations that you, if you long as you have a deep understanding of positions and as long as you have a deep understanding of what's dangerous and what's not, you're not going to usually put yourself in a bad spot. He'll occasionally, if you're training with friends, you'll like say, can I do, let me just try to do this because you won't worry. Like if you get mounted or something like that,

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       you know, you, you know like in a competition where it's for your life. Whereas if you were in a fight, you wouldn't try this position. But I think that's where a lot of like new cells, it helps you like with standard word helps you riff a little more like let me try this. But that can also lead to a bad place where like my nowhere lock up man all the time. We all, we both do it all the time. I mean, I did it this past week and a couple of times a, um, it's like 203 fuckups. It's like plenty of, but when you do a new shit, when you're doing new shit, especially like at the Ice House, I did a lot of new shit this weekend and you know I'm preparing for this special in Atlanta, which by the way, if you go out of my Twitter feed or go to Joe rogan.net there's a link for it.

Speaker 4:          00:12:30       It's war at the Tabernacle on four 20 and I'm going to be filming my special, she already to sell it one show. The first show is gone and then the second one selling fast. So if you, if you want to get it and I would love to have you guys come down. It's going to be a lot of fun. It's going to be crazy. I'm psyched. I'm psyched to do it in Atlanta too cause I haven't been in Atlanta in a long time. What is a tavern? Nippon Napal I called Brian. That's in the video. It is the terra now. What is it like? What is that like a nut? Because everyone acts like bags. Everyone knows what one of those is. I have never had gotten rid of one. It's just the name, the tabernacle choir. Yeah. It's a nice, a nice name for something for, well, it's like, I don't know. I mean I should [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          00:13:18       I feel stupid for not knowing what it told me. It was the tabernacle buffet, I would say. Wow. It must be an excellent buffet. I'm sure it's like it's fuck. It's like Rolls Royce or something. You know? It's like some name a pedia residents are dwelling place. Wow. The Tabernacle Hebrew Bro. That's why I don't, it's English. Your people man. Yeah. Well that's what he, the Tabernacle is a, a, a residence or a dwelling place according to the Hebrew Torah. Old Testament. See, it just sounds annoying. Well, I don't know how that got to Atlanta. Is there a lot of Jews in Atlanta? No. Christian started using it. Is that what it is? Yeah, I guess so. Maybe that was the English translation for them. For a hut. Huh? That's interesting. So it's just a house. It just, it's like a super fancy way to say house tabernacle. Never.

Speaker 4:          00:14:08       I've never known what that word meant. So that's where we're at Tabernacle and it's on four 20 which is just so silly. We had, it's perfect. It's so silly. We had to do it. When you told me you were thinking about it, I was like, no, dude, that's probably just do that. No, I'm it. It costs us extra money to do it this way because they want, everybody else wanted to do it the next month, but I was like, you know what, it's for 20 it's just so silly. Yeah, let's just get in there, get it did film and unformed 20 it's just so perfectly goofy. You know I, it is. You know, I mean fucking, I love how Doug Benson does is for 20 shows four 20 in the afternoon because look, yes, it's pro posture. It's, it's silly, but, and we all agree on, he's cut out everybody, but it's hardcore

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       fans. He's getting, you know, he's getting on up at four 20 in the afternoon on a Sunday. Hey darn casual Doug Denson fans showing, do you guys ever have a screen name that had been there for 20 in it? No. Dare you. You did. You did. She ever have one that had 69 in it. I probably, I definitely had red band for 2012 brill. Yeah. No, I never, I never did AOL or something. Wait, let me ask you a question though. Oh, fuck it. No. Ask Wash it. If it just enhances your, why should certain those things being an enhancer. Well, it's all in. What does it look? Doesn't it is a reality is everything you take is a performance enhancer from vitamins too. Minerals to a good diet. Isn't it just what's harmful for your body? That's what they started out low trying to outlaw is what they're trying to do is to try and stop low level physical engineering.

Speaker 2:          00:15:48       And that's what steroids are low. This low level. It's inevitable that they're going to come out with nanobots. It's inevitable. They're going to have the ability to literally change your genome. It's, it's inevitable. It's Kinda how it's coming. It's going to have dr and this deep six nine, here we go. He was all genome that he a bull's eyes. Everything might not be in our lifetime. And I mean, it might be in another lifetime after, uh, after us, but some time if you look, as long as we don't blow ourselves up or get here will make everything better, we're going to make things better. There's no way then there's no, there's no technological wall they're going to hit. These fucking guys are coming up with incredible discoveries and these incredible discoveries actually make those other incredible discoveries easier. So many, all the technology essentially works together as far as like computer processing power and as far as knowledge gained and learned and you build on that instead of having to Redo those experiments to get to a certain point, you're already far, far along the process.

Speaker 2:          00:16:44       And then these new minds just add to that. They're going to figure out a way to do something that's way crazier than steroids. They're going to figure out a way to make doctor Manhattan's, they're gonna figure out a way to make giant blue dunes with giant blue dicks. And I mean it's going to be real. It's going to be unstoppable. There's no, once it comes, once it becomes an actual technology, once they get over the morals, then it's only a matter of time. It's like a hundred years, is it 200 years? We will be unrecognizable 200 years from now. If as long as we stay alive and keep getting more and more, we're trying really hard to fuck it up. We're trying really hard to eat every fish in the fucking ocean and then throw all of our shit in there and plastic will live longer. They accomplish more things. Yeah. But we're, we're trying to still trying to fuck up the ocean and overcrowd this place. That's an issue. You know the, you know, they say you can produce enough food and like one state of the country you're going to take like North Carolina, if you filled North Carolina with farms, you could produce enough food to feed the whole world. But I say fuck you. You know, I say you're crazy. I think your calculations

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       suck off. Yeah. He could barely have people scratch by in North Carolina is not that big stupid. And by the way, those people are just going to make more people. And then when are you gonna do you're gonna move into South Carolina because they go to and make with, I'm going to assume, assuming there was like a line up to the door North Carolina right now, I think we're okay and we'll probably be okay for another generation, but we're eventually going to reach a point in time where there's too many people. I mean we're okay here in America where there are certainly not okay in other parts of the world. Population bomb, population explosion, right. Rachel Carson and her husband wrote books about it. Know, but that's the number one pop a problem for our population explodes. And the Kansas state itself. Yeah. I mean it has to cause it, it rebuilds the uh, exponentially and instead of geometric, so it's not like too this year, two more.

Speaker 4:          00:18:37       Next year or two more. It's like two then, then five, then ninth and 20, you know, 20 which just keeps going. Fuck. So it'll be the last minute. I'll just go route and we'll just fill this place up and we'll all just humongous plague. Yeah. That's a real issue, right? Yeah. How do you stop that rain is going to come, you know, you gotta wonder. You got to wonder if you know, human population, uh, has like a, like a number, like a cap to keep it at. I think that's what aids is really a, it's the plague. It's all just nature's way of, um, of balancing it out, trying to fight it. Well, how come they play today then? That doesn't make any sense. There's way more people, way more people will weigh less plague. I think things come up because of it. Well, I think Sorta, but we combat that with science doing nature's way of combating it.

Speaker 4:          00:19:23       Well, we're, we're greedy bitches. You want to stay alive off certain diseases when it's presented with too many calls. It's like I'm out. Right? It's all my white blood cells are gone. Right? Yeah. Wonder what I mean? Somebody actually brought that argument up recently. I forget where it was, but the idea was that a virus was actually engineered that viruses and by nutrition nearby nature to attack humans keep us us off. Yeah. Not fucked up. We just have a thousand words. That's all we got left. Thousand words. What does Eddie Murphy movie making bad moments doesn't have enough money. It doesn't have enough money and another 0% on rotten tomatoes to ah, just, you can just not make any movies if you want. What do you have enough? It's can't be about the money. It can't be go back to comedy as well. But that guy was hilarious, so I know he can do that.

Speaker 4:          00:20:12       We get some moments. We got to get them on. We'd got to find him. He doesn't smoke pot kind of. Really? His brother does. Charlie's smokes weed. I never smoked with him once he tried it, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure. How do we think he didn't try and Charlie. Charlie Murphy gets high as full. Really? Yeah. He gets high. He smokes blunts amongst those. Um, those ones with the tobacco on the outside, we got high. That was a totally different high. That's weird. That's a weird high man. We were in the back of my tobacco's. It make sense to leave by the way. He had his bad. Here's the deal. You're not supposed to smoke cigar leaves. You just inhale the puff those, but they're smoking. They're inhaling them. So they're taking these cigar leaves that you're not supposed to be inhaling in the first place and they're inhaling them with their weed. It's craziness. Like not the way to do it, man. You know, they like to do those real Philly blunts. Phillies fucked up like, give me the worst shit. Just fucked me up here. These are disgusting. The idea that you have, take one of those shoe cigars or suites, Shitty grandpa cigars and actually inhale it all my time. Once in a while you don't do it every day.

Speaker 4:          00:21:25       I had a couple cigars before. They were like sweetened cigars. Have you ever had those reforms? Swisher sweets. Grape ones are good. Get a nice buzz. Offers a guard. That's what people don't know. You know, a lot of people don't know you can get just as high off a good cigars. You can off shit for cigarette every like once every few weeks. You know? Like when I'm just in college or when I just start. It was like when you have one it's like, Whoa, that's a major bus. Yeah. Yeah. The real deep tobacco buzz, like especially real tobacco, like cigar tobacco. It's nice. It's a nice feeling. I mean those dudes aren't doing that just because it looks cool. Like they're getting high, they're getting high from that tobacco, it's a weird high. You're getting nasty. Sklar brothers. I used to smoke before I play basketball outside in the courts and I got picked up on, so like, all right, come on, we're starting.

Speaker 4:          00:22:12       So I had to like take my last few puffs of a cigarette and this, I forget it was Randy or Jason, but one of them was like, all right, you have to cut, strip, quit smoking. I was like, I know, I know it's bad for your health. I'm like, I know. And they'll like, it makes you stank. I'm like, I know, I know. And like it's not cool. Like, well that's where you're wrong. Clearly it's cool. That's the only reason anyone that's ever started smoking. It's cool. It's cool. How's it cool, cool people. That's just always been a cool thing. It's been an, I don't give a fuck thing. Yeah. You know, that's the reason why people smoke cigarettes cause they don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck. You know, you see a private investigator and a movie and he's taken a drag off a cigarette.

Speaker 4:          00:22:45       That guy doesn't give a fuck, was not even not, you know, he's feeding his own monster, feeding his own monster, but it's cigarette. It's funny, but actors, it is weird because he never seen him in movies do it, but it's only when they're off. I see a lot of them onset, you seem to stamp out and I'm trying to quit and they're always trying to quit puffing the loss. They just go until you're ready to quit. And I quit one of the best attorneys on a set and everybody's high. When you get on one of those sets, everybody's high. All the writers are high and the actors getting high directors high. Those are the real movies we did me and run. It's easy to those tiger woods commercials and so then he left and we had to keep talking trash, shoretel ourselves. We play the video game right.

Speaker 4:          00:23:25       And they were like one, some beers look okay and they just started giving us beers. The production company, you're talking trash, whatever and like wanna smoke some pot and we're like, you better not, we're not going to get any work done, but it's very cool. That's awesome. Yeah. If you're with a good group of people, man, they want to have fun. That's the way to have fun. You know what I mean? Thinking about how we do the podcast, you know we get high before every single one of them. W W rose doing the ice houses drunk. Yeah. I brought a bottle of wine last night, brought a bottle of wine. We're drinking wine on a paper or plastic cups. I not, it's fucking great man. It was decent wine.

Speaker 4:          00:24:04       Kava Aretas Cabaretta has deli in Canoga Park that place today, that Italian place. Holy Shit. Is that place good? Really? Yeah. I picked up a bottle of wine and some sandwiches. Boom. It's the only place here on the west coast where you can get like real east coast Italian food Cabaretta is. Yeah, it's in, it's in Canoga Park. It's fuck. Sandwiches are amazing. They have, they have a sausage and pepper sub that I can not not get get it every time. I always say, well, I'm an experiment this time. Nope. I got to get the sausage and pepper because it's so ridiculous to eat a whole one. You have to be some kind of massive, it's ridiculous. It's preposterous. You have to be some just crazy glutton to eat a whole one. I have eaten a whole one, but that's what I thought. Yeah. I'm sure you have your own animal and we took Joe.

Speaker 4:          00:24:49       Really? Yeah. I've seen you a greasy Tony's, whatever those places where, where you've got the garbage pail. Yeah, whatever it was and I was like, got the small is way too much for me. Then you're just killing years. I'm like, fries please. What's that? That sub is, Dan was dangerous. That was like grease utility at Gracie. That was like liquid death. Tony died of heart failure at 52 I only had like seven and I think he was in his sixties I think it was in his 60. You might actually even been seven. He actually looked good for his age. He looked a lot. He looked a lot younger than he was. But yeah, he did die of a heart failure. It's like 24 when a guy named Greasy Tony Dies of heart failure. But I'll tell you what, man, I always love being around that guy. We got pictures for years.

Speaker 4:          00:25:31       Tony's, this was in Tempe, Tempe, Arizona, right across the street from the Improv. There was this 24 hour, uh, Italian joint run by this guy from Jersey and he was a great old character. We would just hang out there after the shows. It was just, he was sold like cool to be around like just to, to to get to hang out with a real character like that guy, you know, like you look in the walls was all the kids pictures when he was young. Like his sons are all flexible picture of the Godfather, a picture of the sign by Sylvester Stallone and it's like so classic old East Coast Italian. It's like just any was so friendly. It was like such a nice guy that like you would go there. I was like, you know like going over your friend's living room or something. It just happened to be behind the counter. He was hugging you and shit. Crazy. Tony was awesome. What a great guy. And the food was fucking perfect. When you're hammered and you coming off of a two shows at the Tempe Improv. Yeah, let's go eat. And you have one of those subs, those fucking steak subs that he had the thing called the garbage pail that you were talking about. What does it weigh? Four pounds, five pounds? I don't know. It was ridiculous. Gross and it was direct. No bullshit. It was close

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       to two feet long. Let me soak this an oil before you eat it too. It was in the oil on not bullshit and it was at least 18 inches long. They were fucking huge. They would cut him in half and each one of them each half. Would it look like a big sub? Yeah. I like this is too much. That's half is too much and I would eat the fucker. That shit. It was like the leg of Esther. That's pretty much what I was like. Whenever we order food at a restaurant and you go first and then the waitress was like, all right, thank you. And she'll, she starts to leave you like, and then no, no, no. That's just for me to hear. My friends want have to show us. She was like, what? Famished. I get famished after shows. You know, you think about the energy that you put out when you're on stage, you know, just focusing and managing everything.

Speaker 2:          00:27:21       It's a lot of mental energy, physical energy around. It's a lot of energy. You know, it's a big burns, Alana. Alana, lock on it. You have to be in shape to do set up to do it right. I mean everyone, I mean, you could do it if you're out of shape, but guarantee you it'd be better if you were in shape. You know what I mean? A guy like Ralphy look how much better would Ralphie may be if he weighed 180 pounds? Yeah. Jesus Christ. I mean, his timing, the way his brain would work, the way his body would move. You know, it's amazing when I see a guy like you could definitely a lot more physical. I think about how many shows he does, how much energy that is. That's incredible. What [inaudible] pants sizes. That's great. Well, yeah. You had some serious health issues, right? Yeah. He stopped smoking weed. He said his doctor told him to stop smoking. I don't know if he stopped eating it. No. His stuff getting it to really, yeah. He said that's the stuff in there. Say Goodbye to all that funny shit.

Speaker 2:          00:28:15       He doesn't mind if it's longer route, but he, uh, yeah, his immune system's, I'll shut the hell. Wow. That's crazy. Yeah, man. He was, um, obviously you, you cannot get that bag. He's a Ralphie's. Uh, even if you don't know Ralphie May, he's probably about 500 pounds at least. Right. It is the sweetest guy in the world. He's so sweet. That's so worried about him. Does he sound all we all worry about them? Well, it's a loses weight. They'll definitely, it was voice will change for sure. So having like a British accent [inaudible] royal. So you still smoking the weed? Yeah, he uh, yeah. I don't know what makes someone get that big. I would be out of my out of school to talk about it. I don't know if it's biological. It's, it seems to me that it's a very recent phenomenon in human history.

Speaker 2:          00:29:01       I don't think people got that big a couple hundred years ago, is losing weight now. He, he, he got put true stout, who's big chain pictorial. Kristen is really fun in New York comic. Massive. Those, wait, I have to produce died. It's the same thing. It's like wake up calls everybody. Yeah. You know, it's very important. It's very important to take care of your fucking body. We're all gonna go man. But you don't need to go early. You don't need to go because that's going to be a terrible feeling to go because you treated your vehicle like shit. That's not, that's not what you should do. It this benefit in DC for this comic who didn't have, who had a stroke but didn't have insurance, every third common cause like, Oh this will be for me in six months. But it's like, it will be, you guys are all getting fatter.

Speaker 2:          00:29:47       Stop. You know, and this really brings up a really interesting point, um, because, um, the ability when someone is fucked, when they're, they're done. When you're paralyzed from the neck down, he can't move the ability to terminate their own life and trying to decide like, you know, some of them can, like they can blank and move a cursor and stuff and they can like write things like, I want to die. Please kill me. Yeah. There was a woman who wrote this article and this woman's name is Allison Pearson and she wrote this article about, uh, do any of us, however ill have the right to die. And this was her argument. Her argument was that you just don't have, it is one of the dumbest fucking, most simple tin mouth diarrhea takes on the subject I've ever read. It's not thoughtful. It's silly. Of course you have the right to die.

Speaker 2:          00:30:38       It's your own rights are given to us by others in order for us to live together. But it's like you can do whatever she wants yourself. Yeah, I mean it's, it's quite, what do you mean? It's completely preposterous? I mean it's, it's one of the dumbest arguments than anyone can ever make. And it's just a really, so what she said, well, she saying, well, she said that I didn't want to read because it's, it's, it's horrible. But the point is she contradicted herself because she had actually written another one. Um, uh, another article a couple of years back where she was praising a woman for killing her daughter because her daughter had a fatal disease and she was just slowly suffering. So the right to kill others, but not ourselves. It was, it's preposterous. She also wrote a really dumb article. We hired her. She, she writes for some English newspaper and she's just ragging Bob, maybe 24, seven.

Speaker 2:          00:31:27       She writes for the any chance he meant that as a double play on the word rag. She writes for the Telegraph. So here's my point. So, um, the other day I look on my website and there's a thread says women versus Doug. Stan hope saga. Oh, what are the fucking dog to this will be great by the way. Doug's latest C D is fucking fantastic. You know, they haven't heard it. It's great. It has made me like, I, you know, you know what's great when you, you know, you hear a guy and I gotta be honest, his last one that he did in Norway, the Oslo one, it wasn't my favorite. It wasn't my favorite out of his stuff. And I love Doug. He's fucking awesome. But this one man, it's almost like he rebounded from that one just like with new renewed vigor and hate and, and just fucking and attacked.

Speaker 2:          00:32:12       It's great. It's so good. Like there's some really fucking hard laughs in it. Yeah, it's great. It's one of my favorite standup comedy, uh, cds in years. It's my favorite. I think it's my favorite of Doug's. I think he just, whatever the fuck he did, whether I, you know, he even talks about it. Oh, he turned a corner as a person. He doesn't give a fuck anymore. It's just trying to have fun. He's not trying to change the world. He's, you know, he thought he was going to try to change world at one time. I realized, dude, yeah, he's just here to tell Dick Jokes and, and, and it's fucking great. It's great. And so I had, um, uh, tweeted about it and, uh, I, it's hard to follow everything the fuck that's going on on Twitter. So I didn't see this women versus Doug Stanhope thing.

Speaker 2:          00:32:58       So I go to Stan, Stan hope, read what this woman had wrote and uh, let me find the exact quote because it was pretty inflammatory. Something about, uh, he, um, I think he, he said that he hopes she gets a cyst three, right? This, yeah. I mean, he's just really angry at this article and you know this, that's a Stan hope. Does. He gets fired up and he, you know, he wants to, uh, figure out some way to, you know, to turn this rage into comedy. Um, so, uh, what is his exact quote? I know shit. I can't find it. I think he at, he said that he wished a, uh, a cyst on her ovaries or something like that. Yeah. I can't even find it. He might've actually tails, well, he might have actually taken the first quote down. Really? Yeah. I got a lot of flack for it.

Speaker 2:          00:33:54       I don't know. That doesn't seem like camps. What was the, what was the thing? Women against Doug. Stan hope. Yeah. I can't find it. That's not backlash. Well, this is what's crazy. So Doug Stan hope calls her a cunt and uh, you know, he was, uh, he said that she was fucking ridiculous and there's a shit article and it's about something that is very near and dear to Doug because that's what his mom had to do. His mom had to take her own life. So yeah. So for [inaudible] from the Mancho, yes. So for some, some smug asshole to, to come. And you know, and just pass judgment like this and then do it with such poor thinking. It just, it's really poorly written and it reeks of a mediocre mind. It reeks of an, uh, someone who is just, they're not capable of grasping how a lot of other people are going to see this and that they don't have enough perspective to tackle this complex issue.

Speaker 2:          00:34:48       And that's, it's insulting. It's insultingly dumb. And so Stan hope you know Cheryl Otis Lady. So her response was to create this women against Doug stand hope page on fear of on Facebook and yeah, women is so it's also on Twitter. I'm women versus Stan hope on Twitter and women versus standard. Why women Facebook exactly the right to die. Exactly. No, because cause he asked for assist. Oh cause he said called her con and she said he hopes she gets assist. Can we anyone join? I think the Fed it ovarian cyst. Yes. Well that's the problem. This is what I was gonna say. The problem is the only people that join women versus Stan Hall, both on Twitter, me and on Facebook. Me To join. No, it's me and all the fucking Stan hope fans from the rogue and board and all

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       the people who heard about this. So they all join. Nobody's gonna fucking women versus stint bitch. Get the fuck out of here. There's a few crazy hookers that are looking to get mad at any guy who says anything bad to any of them. Just hear a quote. Women against so much. She's always, sure I'll sign up for a course. I read one where this one ladies take on it, you know, massage Dennis, like standing up like, what are you fucking talking saying dummy. This is a, you know, yeah, he made a personal attack on her, but that's not the important part. The important part is, this is nonsensical argument by a fucking Dullard saying that really terminally ill people who are in horrible straits shouldn't be able to stop their time on this life. It's somehow or another what is, there's some grand plan that has to pay out.

Speaker 4:          00:36:23       Is there some pill that you know about that we know? Is there some new leaf that we're going to find? The Amazon that restores his 80 year old guy who's paralyzed from the neck down. Jesus fucking Christ. Bitch, you don't know what you're talking about. You're talking nonsense and you shouldn't be allowed to be in a position where you have an opinion that can be expressed and then can influence people. Fucking stupid for them. She worked for, yeah, she works for this fucking newspaper, man. This is why I tried to save her telegraph, arguing with the bullet and because I'm like, I don't want this to be about a female or male at all. Like I just want you to know that you're stupid. So I try not to use gender specific words. Yeah, this is, uh, it's just, you don't, you don't have to gender specific with this lady.

Speaker 4:          00:37:02       I haven't, I don't think I have, but unless I called her a bitch. But the way I say that, I call them and say that's what happens with Doug. He was my boss. It's not his fault, but that's what they latch onto. I use with my best friends. I was like, bitch, you crazy. I mean, I'm not saying she's a bitch as a woman, but that's what I, that's what they latch onto. Why you hate for you to talking about? Well, because they want to be able to say, you hate women course I do worst. The women, I don't hate them, but as a whole, like they look down on them. He definitely looked down on them is I looked down on men too. There's a lot of men out there that are pictures. I run into a lot of very unfortunate men out there in this world that if I was a woman, I would be sad if I was a woman and I wanted to have a real man.

Speaker 4:          00:37:47       Good luck. Good luck finding one of those fucking things. There's like a specific type of female drunk that I hate, but there's also a specific type of mail junk that I hear you, dude. I would way rather be a guy. Then B. I think there's way more women that are cool. Then there are men that are cool. It's tuning me. Douche bags out there that have some weird chip on their shoulder. You know, there's some weird need to prove themselves and this is just too many aggressively cunty men, you know, I think there's a lot of country women, but I think it's way more country men. He's just fucking people. There's a lot of guys that are just going like this, just their chest and trying to like and like why, why, why are you fighting? What are you doing? See never who wants this to never train.

Speaker 4:          00:38:25       If you just trained, they would never do that. You know, you go to a bunch of guys who are like Jujitsu guys go out there like the nicest, most polite people ever. You know, it can be easier. It's way easier. Stupid. You know? I realized, you know that sometimes I used to do this thing, I don't do it anymore where it's like you're at a yellow light and trying to like pause far enough so the car behind you misses the light and you get to go through it. But I'm like, the amount of energy that takes to do that would be equal to the amount of energy to speed up and get the guy in behind you. The game works either way, you're trying to accomplish something total can't move. It's like you can be nice to still have the fun of the, of the game.

Speaker 4:          00:38:58       Yeah. Yeah. I think it's, I think people just get locked into a wave. It's absolutely, people get locked into a way of thing and we get also get locked into frustration. Some of the most aggressive people I've met word the most unsuccessful, the most frustrated. The reason why they were just like constantly involved in conflict. It's because they were dealing with a lot of internal conflict and no confirmation of, of, of anything good. No confirmation of goodness. It's from their life. You know, there's no confirmation of them being worth something. They were always getting dumped in relationships or you know, in the middle of fighting with their boss and just shit on either side. Yeah, there was always conflict. And when you're in that situation that that constant state of that's your norm of unease comes, you're like your, your base plan. It's fucking, it's the worst.

Speaker 4:          00:39:45       It's worst to you around. Yeah. It's the worst to be around, but the reality is you and I have it far easier than the average person. There was a threat on the underground give. I think the average person isn't like that. I think that's a lot of people, but the average person. Cool. You're absolutely right. But I'm saying the average person is under a lot more stress. It doesn't, it seems like standup comics will be under a lot of stress and we sort of are, but we're also a different stress. Yeah. There was, there was a threat on the underground talking about Sunday night, and the guy's like, man, fucking Sunday night, he just, some dude just reached out. He goes, Sunday nights are depressing, you know? Do you guys find Sunday depressing and focking? Everybody's like, yes, I hate Sunday nights. I hate going back to work.

Speaker 4:          00:40:24       It makes me sick and I'm sitting here, I'm just relaxing. I'm dreading. I'm dreading that. I got to go to work in the morning and I'm like, wow, that's when you really realize how stupid, lucky we are. Just stupid. Lucky to be stand up to me. I've been stupid lucky across the board and even fear factor. I never woke up and was like really mad that I had to go and make retarded amounts of money to I. I do that. It wasn't my favorite thing to do but I was never mad at it but the dude's like stand up or anything like that will work for the UFC. It doesn't even feel like a job. It's something that actually when I'm like tired and I don't want to go to some awesome Gig or get on the plane to go some great place, I'm like, I have a worse than Ethiopia. Just like put it out how it is like a relaxed though. You're going to complain but keep up, keep it. Say it out loud and she put that on your wall. I have it worse than Ethiopia. It'll force you to just not be a bitch. This ice cream is melting. I have it worse than Ethiopia.

Speaker 4:          00:41:17       Yeah, there's, I'm like, let me complain, but obviously I'm going fine. It's super easy to get into a shit mindset. But the bottom line is that life is a struggle. It's a constant struggle and doing anything. It's a struggle like we were talking about and you know, writing new material. We're both doing that right now. We're both, you know, you'd go up but sometimes it just eats Dick. It's not working. It's sometimes you don't know where you're going with something cause it's a new bed and you're trying, you try to say it one way and now he tried another way but then it sort of diffuses the second part of it and then you've got to listen to it and go over it and maybe rewrite it. It's a weird process. Sometimes you're like, okay this section just needs work and then the next time you're like, it's telling me it's work and the next time like dammit.

Speaker 4:          00:41:56       And it's something that is coming. Bits just show up done. Oh yeah. You know, sometimes like you get an idea and I have gotten an idea on the way to a show and then got to the show and then boom, the bit was done and it was killer. It kills like an old bit, you know, one of my bits from my Facebook thing the first time you said it. Yeah. Which Facebook thing? Wait a minute, I don't, I'm not trying, I don't want to run. One of your drugs are special. If, if, uh, the premise, if they had Facebook and like 1800 hundreds. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, that one came out like immediately, like, yeah, that was that night. It was theater. I forget what. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes that's really fun. That's a tag though. That was sort of easy because it was, the big premise had already been set.

Speaker 4:          00:42:40       Oh, right. You were saying the whole thing. Yeah. But um, it's, it's weird, man. The, the process is so weird the way the process of creating new stuff, but it's so exciting too. It just gets you like real stimulated. Like, that's my favorite time because it's the most unsteady time you're going out there with all these like fucking weak ass weapons. It's like you're playing, it's like become a bad motherfucker. Starcraft or world of Warcraft. I'm going to Mike Tyson and punch out and you're like, what the fuck? It just knocks you out in two shots and then you quit and then you start all over again. Yeah. With the new account. That's a better example. And you're like, what? Yeah, you're a noob with shit. We played, we played the thing. We have [inaudible] we got to play tiger woods golf with tiger woods. Right, right.

Speaker 4:          00:43:24       And he drove it off the tee wants and he like went into this creek. He was like, I couldn't clear the creek. It was like 140 yards. Like yeah, welcome to regular PR, PR, PR people. Golf Tiger. Yeah. I'm just mumbling cause he was like, that's a regular people do it. I tried that, I got stuck in like a right, right there. That's in a skiff. Worst feeling. And you're on a stage in the middle of a fucking perfect Joe. And be like, come on body, stop it. You're Bonnie. Just hiccups. I don't word. Oh God damn. I'm running this whole moment. I almost did that this week and I paused myself and it actually made the joke better. Oh really? I almost fucked up. I had an almost fuck up where uh, where was I felt it come out, twist it. Like why does my tongue this shape?

Speaker 4:          00:44:06       I paused and extra second that I paused and extra section after the word after I got it correct. And it was like a better pause. It was chance buy stuff on accident. Right? Oh. Like I realized, I was like, Oh yeah, that gives you more time. This I am saying something kind of crazy right there. Maybe it's better to contemplate it for a moment. Political for you here. The second step is sometimes you know, stand up is it's just technical. Yeah. And you do it in front of different people. You know, you got an, that's the only

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       art form that I know of where you literally need them to practice it in front of. I need, I don't know. I know some of this stuff is, that's funny. You know, when I write it, I know some of the stuff that's going to kill, but some of the stuff, every now and then it's some shit that you didn't even think it was funny. He thought it was like laughing and washes. It could be like the biggest throwaway to you and it just, and that's like the biggest laugh of the job. Find a lot of times that I'll do certain jokes that I really enjoy that may or may not get us bigger laugh, but I'll do the jokes that get a humongous laughed and I'm like, yeah, I like it, but it's not my favorite. But you guys seem to like it, so I'll keep that in there.

Speaker 2:          00:45:06       So you're listening to these ones that I want to say? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like a tool. There's no substitute for fucking doing it on stage in front of people. There's no way around it. So I used to hear about bill Cosby. Bill Cosby would just write his whole routine and then just like go on the tonight show and just do it. Yeah, he just did it. He would say, he just knows what funny is it certain people like us go differently. I would like to see that dude, if he's in town, you want to see him with me? Yeah, I totally, I bet. I bet he comes to town like once a year. First Time I tried to leave the day before he was there and I was really upset. Yeah. I like to see him because it's hard when you hear a lot of the veteran comics talk about him because he's reached his deity status and if you can't take it out on us, because I remember the one time, you know obviously George Carlin's one of the all time greats is no doubt about it.

Speaker 2:          00:45:48       It's like one of the greatest comedians at several lives. But there was a time where he was coming to the comedy store and he was working on some new stuff and it was not good his last or second or maybe third the last special. But yeah, it was like, no, it wasn't good. There was one good bit in there, their hour and we all kind of sat around and non and no one wants to say anything and you know, and maybe you and I got together and we were like, yes. It wasn't going private, it wasn't good. But meanwhile he's fucking one of the greatest of all time. But yeah, you have to say like, I'm not taking anything away from his overall achievements. There's that moment and it really, the reason was there's a reason for it. It wasn't that he wasn't a good comic anymore, it's that he had an incredible workload and he's, he did the Louis C k thing where he's in, but he was the originator of it.

Speaker 2:          00:46:32       He would come up with a completely new act every do it like a dozen or two dozen special, so credible in his sixties right. And he was, or was, it was an older, yeah, and he's writing a whole new special and performing every year. It gave me 20 bucks. I went to, I went to the deli form [inaudible] form and I get, you're getting a ton of books. I was like, oh, it's on a house. He goes, yeah, I know. And I was like, thank you so much. You can get 20 bucks from George Carlin's should a frame that shit. And I think I needed it. That's, I mean that's so courageous to that he would do that. That he would go out there at 20 bucks. No, whatever. You try out all the new shit bomb when he could just pull out, you know, hours of classes. He said that his workout, he would be like, I'm not doing the old stuff. Don't, don't ask for it. I'm not going to do it. Yeah, here we go. Yeah. That's how he had to do it. Amazing. It's amazing. Really. It's hard to put yourself in that position, but if you do it enough, practice enough, probably just the same thing as working out. You get to a place with like happier that you just rely on the old

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       material and you actually just went through the new stuff. Yeah. But there's also Gaffigan and I talked about this and one of the things that he said was that you gotta have both. He goes, I, he goes, I'm, it's really important to me to be really good to have a good show. These people are paying a lot of money. I'm, I can't just work out in front of them. And I was like, you're right. I feel the same way. Like I want to, I sandwich new jokes in between. Well that's already known and killers. That's why I love workout sets at the store in New York or anywhere. It's just like, this is just, you know, it's a fucking Tuesday night. I want to hear to see anybody. Don't you think that, you know, you got to like get there. The audience is sort of a respect before you like start doing new shit.

Speaker 4:          00:48:10       I feel like here's what I'll do. I know what you mean. It's like you want to open her, it's going to get up right away. Opener. That works for sure. And find a new one. I'll find a new one for this year by not having one. That'll make me find a new one. That's a good way to look at it. But not having a closer that'll force me to get a closer. But if I do my eh, whatever and ending and then like, let me hit you with some great bid, I know works, then I don't leave with that feeling of like, I need something better there. Did you, uh, get bummed out if people, uh, send you like shitty messages about your show on Twitter? No. Thought you sucked. Because rarely is it super bad. I'm trying my best with whatever that new materialists and then it gets better and better.

Speaker 4:          00:48:46       So the more and more of it goes, well maybe then eventually all you need is just that closer. But the first 10 is great, you know, and then it becomes like, so, so yeah, we've got to do some things, man. Let's go to Alaska or something like that. We've got some shit. Your manager, and I told him, I'd say, he's going to forget again. So just Lo, I'm telling you, just look into it. The longest day of the year she'll press is Jay as a July 21st to the 23rd. Oh, can you get shrooms in Alaska? Fuck. Of course you can write this the way he says that. Of course you can. There's no way that can't be true. This is the guy who got almost were arrested at the mall of America. You, what do you mean to say? Is this the guy who got led off by the cops have mall of America?

Speaker 4:          00:49:27       That's one way of playing it. But you did get, I don't, I can't remember the last time the cops came at mall of America to talk to me. Yeah, I'm walking the line better. Ooh. Did you ride the roller coaster at the mall of America? I didn't. It looks Janky and old. It's like it's like done. Everything's from like 22 on the side. The inside rollercoaster. They have a water ride to the mall of America. The biggest mall Edmonton Mall in America. Edmonton Maltsberger in Canada. Wow. Yeah. That's the biggest wall in the world. I think so. Have the by the top people though. How does like Dubai, how they tolerate the fact that we have the biggest mall? They must be going crazy. It's a really, people driving their cars and in Dubai like have you seen, have you seen those photos of just like Mercedes driving by with a big like lion arm hanging out?

Speaker 4:          00:50:18       I haven't seen it. There's a new show called the Shahs of sunset. All Iranian sell the Persia here? Yeah. Okay. Can I just say this and you could disagree with me if you want. You can put this on the record. I've got the worst of the whites. Wow. Persons and our mediums. You are the Julius Jew of all types. The way you said it. The worst. The worst of the whites of all the ways by Paul said that though you, you, you so like made a Jewy face. God, I'm becoming an old man. Oh Man. Set in his ways. I worry about that man. I say something like, like someone will say something. I'm like, why? What are you saying? I'm like, what am I god, I'm an old Guinea. Yeah. Listen to me. I'm some fucking some old Guinea me. What? I was supposed to become the worst of the worst of the light. I'll tell you, dad. Dot. Wurster the whites.

Speaker 4:          00:51:10       They were fine. They were having a good time. I mean, they seem like they were enthusiastic people. Oh, this you got think about. Yeah, there's the show. They're starting, their dad's daddy lacks in the fucking functional working so store that was handed down to them. I am listening. I am all for anybody coming from somewhere that sucks. Like I ran and coming to America and guess what? They're going to have some, some fucking growing pains. They're going to have to, I mean, it's not okay. It's a completely suppress culture. It's the ones that act overly that both people are falling for the first time ever. And like, you know, six generations. You know what I mean? Think about that. They come to America over the last, I mean, look, the, the whole hostage crisis shit happened in the Carter administration and then they stopped calling themselves Iranians, cause I ain't a Iranian girlfriend when I was, she was Iranian then she was Iranian and then they changed the person and they change it to Persian.

Speaker 4:          00:51:55       Why? Because it got a bad rep fucking nobody wanted anything to do with Iran. Man. You don't, you don't know what it was like at that point. Like when I was, when she was my girlfriend, this is what, like my first girlfriend ever. I was like 11 years old and she was this girl across the street and I'm fucking mother. The mother was Iranian, she was half Iranian and half American. And the mother tried to stab the father with a knife while I was there. The cops got there. It was like, it's really crazy. It was a crazy little situation. She was a really nice girl. But like they were in like deep turmoil. Like her, her family was in detail and trying to get out. No, no. I mean like the mother tried to kill the fucking father with a knife. What? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:52:33       They got arrested while we were there. It was really crazy. But, um, the, um, my point was like, I got to see like, you know what it's like in their eyes to have escaped. I ran and I ran was, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's a fucking Dick dictatorship. I don't give a shit what anybody says. The, all those voting's and it's nonsense over there. There's a reason why everybody erupted and went fucking crazy after the last election. There's no real democracy going on. And I ran. That's great. Hunting anytime soon, but oh no, there's not. It's a scary place. Excuse your behavior when you come into a comedy club late at night. I don't know why this place. Yeah, you know what it is, man. They're just like the guineas of the fucking 1930s it's the same thing. It's so those are the stuck. Most of the word. Listen, that's my people. I'm a Jersey Guinea. I was born in Newark, New Jersey. Man. You know, that's, that's the, that's the environment. They're escaping

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       something that's sucks bad, you know, and so it takes him awhile to assimilate to the greatest culture the world's ever known. Hello. Welcome to cafe. It was one time before you, there's like 5% guys came into the store late at night. I would sit in the back row there and run as AC is working the cover booth. He was smoking a cigarette in the back row. It was like one 30 in the morning, but the Jim Painter, the door guy was on stage and these guys come in and smoking a cigarette and we're like, hey guys, you can't, uh, Steve said, guys, it's $20 cover. And they're like, oh, okay. And they sat there for him and he goes, guys, it's $20 cover and you can't smoke in here. You're going to go out. And they kind of get this look of like, alright. And they walked towards the steps, waited there for like two minutes and I just go get the fuck out you filthy Persians.

Speaker 5:          00:54:08       Oh. And they just started rushing at me. Steve is holding back their kicks. They were trying to spit at me a kick. I'm trying to be cool and just sit there and their kicks. We're just missing me. Oh my God, I'm so mad at them. I was like, get the fuck you're so rich. You've done nothing. You're all 19. Get the fuck out of here. So where are they getting their money from? Others. What does, what does Dan do? That worked hard because he overcame that shit you were talking about. Ah, all they did was inherit them. This is a problem with a really rich kids. You know like parents like you little bro. A lot of parents are rich kids are not taking care of those kids. Yeah. Well don't children were black. I'm working a lot too. They'll let them wear black on black. It's like you're a Douche. Stop looking at your sweater. Oh yeah. No, this is cool. You have the gay flag sweater. Yeah. He sitting on some picture pages. How could you possibly ask me to tell them what they're the worst? They'll worst. What colors to wear though? What? It's were black on black now with three buttons on done. They're really nice people and they were black on black. They would never act like that. I won't have you waited for your wife to yell at you in the back of it.

Speaker 6:          00:55:18       You're shy in. My Dad would never tolerate though. You're going off.

Speaker 5:          00:55:28       Oh my God, you're so hilarious. It comes out of him. He said, I just visited my parents. Maybe that's all. Maybe if you were a Persian, you could get away with saying that. No. Why? That's going to have some person's mad at you. They're going to come to the show and be less Persian. He,

Speaker 5:          00:55:43       it's only the ones, you know what I'm talking about. I do because, because again, in your defense, I am McGinney. I'm a Tom, mostly Italian and I don't like most Italians. There's a lot on say like, oh, you're Italian. Oh, you're a person. You're fine. Yeah. It was a lot of my life, but there's just this giant club. I wouldn't even say it's most, I don't like, I would say it's 30% Renault, like the Milton Palestinians, 30% Douche bags. So they ruin it for everyone. That's all you think of. Exactly. And all these goddamn mob movies, which just pumped those fuck heads up. It was really dumbed. Fuck titles them. Do you know who I am? I'll come back there. I know people kill yourself. I know people. Oh, that's horrible. We stop

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       it. Get rid of the loan. Let's do this. Yeah. I wonder how much, um, you know, they say that the big mob in this country is the Soviet mob and that they know how to keep their mouth shut. Cause the Terry, yeah, they don't walk around with fucking giant diamond rings on and they were like very sophisticated and there are forms of organized crime. They're the most dangerous because they're like the computer dude's Oh yeah. And the ruthless like, you know, that's how that's a cold world man. You know? Then those people went through a lot of shit that we can't even begin to fathom. These guys are like, yeah, I pinky off. I won't even blink. When we were in Japan, I didn't see any pinkies cut off to gym now. And everyone wore a black, a lot of wearing black. Would you yell at the Japanese?

Speaker 4:          00:57:08       No. Black on black. On black on black pants and a black guy. Black pants and a black shirt. NFC. See what is wrong with that? First of all, if you're worn out. Yeah. It's a little douchey. Black on black, you know my friend Bud, that's all he wears. Black on black. His whole fucking wardrobe is black, black button down. He has black jeans, probably a black tee shirt and black jeans, black sneakers. This motherfucker has black. Everything is black car. He's his. His whole thing is that he only wears black. I want you to tell about something. If he does that, because I know what he's going forward. This is all right. If he splashes a little bit of color in there, it would really pop. Maybe some colorful shoes or some socks. A, you would never get your car. Get my car murdered. What do you mean they got all blacked out?

Speaker 4:          00:57:55       That's murdered is the matte black matte. Oh yeah, call it that. Cool. Matt. He has Matt Gray. Really bad ass. I was like, damn, maybe we should do my car on my gt three. Get it man. That paint your house that way. Like Madam Merrill's house. Damn. You rolling dirty over there? What are you talking about it? What does that mean? Oh, that's what they'd would say about your house. You'd be like, yeah, we're rolling. Go. Do you think you think we're not rolling dirty? It's weird though, like not shiny is like in now. People got tired of training. He's crows. That's why I don't wash my car. Really? I like shiny. I like shiny. You know there's certain cars that look like space ships to me when they're shiny. I mean like I saw a Ferrari yesterday. It was one of these new four, five, eight Italians.

Speaker 4:          00:58:46       They look like, like it's like something from Battlestar Galactica. He's got these crazy, I lights down the sides like $300,000 that's about the time. It's a house. It's transportation, but it's not do it. It's not. It is not. It's a Goddamn ride. Everywhere you go. It's a wild screaming ride that men makes the most marvelous noise. It was Italian since they have this fucking giant engine. It's been amazing. It's the good part of Italians and it's like, yeah, but I'm sure it breaks down like crazy. My people are not to be trusted like meticulous. Some things,

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       they're not good at that. They're good to the passion. Did they go to the crazy thing and impulsive stuff, but it has this noise. It's kind of drove by and was like, Whoa, it's like this wild animal noise, man. It's just such a beautiful, like passionate noise, but $300,000 and it looks like a spaceship. You know, like the cars they're coming out with today, they, they're, they're, they're slowly starting to look like what we thought cars would look like in the future, you know, for a while they'd be like, you know, at Ford Festiva what the fuck is this? This is not space. This is not, this is not interesting. And this is just some shit shitty looking box that you've created. You know, the older, older cars and older, uh, Toyota's and share bad as mustangs for awhile. A lot of terrible shapes, man.

Speaker 2:          01:00:03       But now they're finally figuring out a way to like, make cars look everything except like, you should look into hybrids. Yeah. There's still look like shit. Except those Fiskars. Have you seen the fiscal Fiskars a die believe it's a Dutch company and they've created the first a, I think they're electrically, I think one of them may be a hybrid and one of them is all fully electric, but they're really cool shapes. They're really wild looking one, they have like a sports car version of it and have like a big like bad ass a Dan version. It looks like a almost like a Maserati or just wait until they get it to about 300 or 400 miles per hour rate. Miles branch once I get that. Yeah, they're not quite there yet, but the real issue with DME is with these electric cars, it's conflict minerals.

Speaker 2:          01:00:46       The real issue is there's only a limited amount. Well, lithium ion is what you need to make those batteries. There's not a lot of that shit around and you've got to get it in from places where people work for slavery. Really? Yeah. Most of it's coming from the Congo and isn't that what's in batteries and like regular batteries? Lithium Ion, yeah, laptops, everything. The conflict minerals or one of the biggest crisis conflict chargeable. No, the, the, the idea is they come from Afghanistan, they come from Congo places. Yeah, exactly. Like blood diamonds. Yeah. Well what, what, what people don't realize, you know, when you think about, like you think about a laptop, there's a gene of things that has to happen and be put in place in order to create this laptop and had the very end of the chain is going to be crazy. It's going to be harder for you to wrap your head around.

Speaker 2:          01:01:31       But the very end of the chain, the very end is a kid in Africa sticking a metal rod into the ground and chipping away rocks. Like literally they're mining. Really? That's what they're doing. Yeah. They're the little kids. [inaudible] that's some of it's cold tran for cell phones. Oh, that's so sad to think about. Are we all just say we'll put up with that? Well, no, on our stuff, people are trying to uh, do things about that. But first of all to go into the Congo is very fucking dangerous. Nobody wants to do that. And you know, you want to go into Afghanistan, Jesus Christ. That's fucking dangerous too. So it's like you only have so many different ways of dealing with the situation and obviously someone's in control over these minerals. I don't know. I don't know what companies they are specifically, but I know those companies must be making ungodly amount of money.

Speaker 2:          01:02:17       I mean, there's something, there's, they estimated that there's more than $1 trillion in unfound minerals in Afghanistan. They have discovered over a trillion in the mountains. So they've known about this chip away at the mountains. I don't know. It's, we'll do, you know, once they start extracting it, then it becomes a big issue of like who's getting this money? Who's in control of the situation? Who's in control of this, this piece of land? It's, it's a, it's a huge, well, not really. No. I mean it's a huge factor and the reason why we're over there and are in, uh, Afghanistan, the first place economically, that place is worth, if the future is in technology and we're, we're pretty sure it is. It's not like technology is going to stop. It's not like we're going to stop evolving it and we're going to need minerals. We're going to need these conflict minerals that are that.

Speaker 2:          01:03:04       Yeah, it's a big issue. What do you think of that guy? Shot up? Pick one reason is doing well, that guy, I read a whole story about him. If you don't know who he is, he killed, uh, I think it was 14 people and be 16, nine, nine, nine. Nine of them were children. Their homes. Yeah. Went into their homes, just gun. He was a soldier and he was a soldier that quit his job in 2001 and signed up for the army after September 11th. Really? And they felt, Catherine, what, you don't want to go on this last exactly. Did it for all the right reasons, you know, did it because he wanted to protect his country and defend his country and thought, you know, this is my time to step up and a and contribute to America. And by all accounts, for the longest time, it was like the greatest guy.

Speaker 2:          01:03:49       He was the life of the party. But he started after his first couple of tours, we went to Iraq, had been shot in Iraq. Um, and then, uh, he did not want to go to Afghanistan, thought he was going to get a promotion and he started thought it was going to get a better job back home and be able to come back home. And he was denied that and he knew that his family is back home. He has two kids and his, um, his house, apparently they had to put it up for sale and the people that went to look at his house, it was in complete disarray. He was becoming an alcoholic. He was, yeah. But look to man that the fucking pressure of what these guys go through to ask anyone to do it ever is crazy. To ask anyone to repeatedly do it over and over again when they don't want to do it anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:04:31       It was nuts. I mean this guy was up until a certain point in time, a hero and then he became a monster. Yeah. The weird thing is people are sort of like sick sickness. Like what are we doing with these guys? And it almost seems as if we're like apologizing for his behavior and it's like, no, what he did was completely wrong and horrible. But let's also examine what puts a guy in this position. Yeah, it's like a little bit, you're, you're totally right. It's so complex. I don't remember. The kid's like, you fucking piece of shit. You should die. And he became a piece of shit and he should die. But how did he become, we trained at a Taco. It's horrible that that guy became a piece of shit and it's horrible that he was forced into this terrible, terrible, unspeakable, unthinkable situation where I've seen people die. He watched a good friend, got his leg blown off that day.

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       Yeah. He, he had watched the guy get his leg blown off that day and then went trunk and went on a rampage. That's when he lost his shit. He, you know, the guy was, he was in trouble, you know. And what they're saying is how they not recognize this, I think because everybody said trouble over there. They're all in war. Suicides are up there though. Like 80%. It's crazy. More. Some more soldiers have died. It at one point in time, I don't know if it's still the case, but more soldiers had died from suicide than had died from combat over there. Yeah, no, it was in one point in time. It was suicides and Co. Let me, let me, it was at least in Afghanistan at was, so that can't be true. I, it sounds like it wouldn't be right. Yeah. I better not have made that up.

Speaker 4:          01:06:01       So how do I put phrases, suicides, suicides, conflict, go for meadow, garden casualties. I will like that. That would shock me. Yeah. It's a way to find out. Suicide claims more US military lives than Afghan war. Yup. Like claims or they've killed more, more soldiers. American military personnel are continuing to take their own lives in unprecedented numbers as the war in Afghanistan and that rack drag on by his late November, at least 334 members of the armed forces had committed suicide in 2009 and more than 319 who were also killed in Afghanistan or more, more than the 319 who were killed in Afghanistan or the 150 who died in Iraq. Wow. Yeah, but it doesn't matter. That was at what point? This is 2000 warheads more had died. Morehead died by suicide or had no one had done more soldiers killed themselves then were killed in combat.

Speaker 4:          01:07:01       Yes. Wow. Two years in a row. But that includes like American soldiers and stuff like still still over here. It's all American soldiers. Not I'm saying still people over here or is that Oh, people over there that were committing suicide. You know what I mean? Yeah. Cause it soldiers all Hawaii's period. It just says American military personnel that might be a little longer, but there's still a the over there, man. I think a lot of them have the, they have the same styles when they come back here and go somewhere or if done post. Yeah, the traumatic stress on many. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I was, I was hoping, I didn't know. That's crazy. Wow. We listened to this before. 2001 the army rarely suffered. 10 suicides per 100,000 soldiers. Now the army suicide rate is 20 per 100,000. It's higher than the registered among males. Eight 19 and 29 gender, age bracket. The highest rate amongst the general population. Wow. So look man, it's obviously, it's fucking terrible over there. And why? Why is it terrible over there? Oh, there you go, man. Talking about, shoot, you don't know. We'll lose full gum trees. The birds country and the world. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       know. I'm asking you. I know what I read. So what's the problem? What I read is someone's doing something really bad. Why did you see the video of the first person shooter? A helmet cam firefight. Pull that up. It's crazy. Hell yeah. Helmet Cam firefight. They have a video of a dude in Afghanistan. Oh. And by the way, I got a message from a guy on Twitter saying that, uh, that him and his boys who are over there in the military in Afghanistan listen to show all the time. So I want to say if you're over there, man, stay safe and get them out of there. Don't kill yourself. Get the fuck out of there as quickly as you can and, uh, you know, Godspeed. And if you do get home and you got some shit fucking with you, apparently they've been doing a lot of studies on post traumatic stress disorder, an MDM ey.

Speaker 2:          01:09:06       So look into that. Look into if you have post traumatic stress disorder, there's a lot of studies now they're suggesting that you can, you can get over it much more effectively with Mtma, which is ecstasy, ecstasy, or the street name for it. Yeah. There's a lot of people that are, um, taking ecstasy and they were administering it to, uh, soldiers coming back from it. They're upbeat. Yeah. Wow. Well, you know, it gives you such a loving feeling that you can abandon all these terrible, definitely like if you're having those feelings, go seek a therapist because your mind is sort of messed up a little three and I pick up those thoughts you got up. Like let me just do this. Yeah. And you gotta be real careful about uh, traumatic brain injuries. You know what, what a lot of this was another thing that happened to this guy.

Speaker 2:          01:09:48       He had a traumatic brain injury, a truck, a truck accident. The truck flipped and uh, he had a um, uh, a significant enough injury that they called it a traumatic brain injury. I don't know the extent of it, but I do know from dealing with fighters, suicide, no, this is the guy that killed everybody. Oh, okay. It fucks with your judgment, unquestionably. It fucks with your judgment and your ability can be in as little as a couple like hard concussions you just in your life. A couple can really deteriorate the suicide that think that concussions can, can lead you to like unquestionably brain failures if you don't put the relax after the well, especially these guys who have concussions and then jump right back in the game and get multiple concussions and the same day that happens after you shouldn't even listen to loud music or anything that you shouldn't watch crazy TV.

Speaker 2:          01:10:38       You just sit there and read a book, do nothing. Yeah, you have to heal up your fucking brain man. And there's not, there's not a whole lot of different things that they can do to help you other than time. And nootropics too. It's one of the things they do. They give, they give them a lot of different nutrients. Like, um, Bill Roman [inaudible] has a whole outline based on that. It's called neuro one. And this was one of the first new tropics I ever got into. Um, no name told us about it. Remember when we were up in San Francisco? And Alison, Sarah, no name on the, uh, Alice morning show, great radio show that it doesn't exist anymore. They were awesome together. Or John, they split. But last time we did

Speaker 4:          01:11:13       no names when we, when I make him drink his purse. Yeah. Um, but my, my point was that he was working out with this Roman Ascii guy. Roman house gets suffered a ton of concussions. He's had many multiple, multiple concussions and he started, uh, looking into a different nutrients that can within he'd his, uh, his, his brethren, his recovery, and he created his own line called neuro one. Oh, that's cool. I used to take it all the time before I played video games. I should take, yeah, I take it all the time. That's one of the things that may have said about Alpha brain. That's what may hand Miller said. Well, that's why I knew Alpha brain is legit. Dude. He goes, I took it and he goes, I was on fire when I was playing video games. I was fucking people up, you know.

And why did you have to do that? He knows people who are in black ops. So what I told your life over it. I Dunno. It's just a thing man. I Dunno. Yeah, it's odd. He's an odd dude. He just decided at one point in time to wear all black and they never switched because some people don't like looking silly man. They don't like looking silly. Too easy. Yeah. What is it that does a specific type of black and white? It's come to you easy. I can't do it all black all the time. That would be, it shows come too easy.

Speaker 4:          01:13:29       What are you just coming all over yourself? You know you come a little [inaudible] it will definitely get on your pants or, that's a good point man. I see what you're saying. Where a lot of white trying to like hide come essentially. Have you ever, yeah, you've done it. You think you're a bit about it. What?

If anybody would say what's on your shirt? I don't even fuck do you think it is bitch? It's white and it's crusty and it's right near my shop. It happens more. You like

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       more than like, I think most people are. I mean did you feel like it happens more with you? Like I, I feel like I have. How often do you jerk it off? I'm out and I see it more than that. I was like, you had sex in like a shirt and everybody. Do you have sex with your clothes on? No. No, but I definitely once you take you to, you should definitely like it's at night. I'm just like, oh I gotta wipe this off and I grabbed a shirt and then forget and then like two weeks later I pick what you pick up teachers off the floor. Where though? No, they float in the air.

Speaker 3:          01:14:41       Why would you put shoes on the floor where? I don't know. See, I think she's one of them. I think shirts have an hour life kind of. I think somebody else talked about this to me once and I totally agree with him for an hour throw right Jarvis right jars. Oh, so like if I have a shirt, like I wear the shirt right now. If I take it off like in an hour or so and put it on the floor or whatever, I think I could still wear it again. They've only one or two hours. I wore the same shirt Friday and Saturday night. T shirt? Yes, but not really. It was a tee shirt over a flannel or over a thermal morale though. Yeah. The reason I did it was because Saturday night was Fitzsimmons Irish show and I'm like, I got to wear green. The green shirt, you're changed none of the tee shirt I, I kept on looking at more the thermal underneath. So the t shirt. Oh no, that's okay. I just did it. [inaudible] though. I only had one in a plus. It's a dope shirt. Which one?

Speaker 2:          01:15:31       It's a Brazilian Jujitsu with Gracie academy and kind of be a degree. You have, you seen it like in Portuguese and with that green sign on if the Brazil yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like real faded. It's this roots of fight line. They have a whole line of like you seen Eddie with that, um, the Bruce Lee Kung Fu tshirt? I think so. Yeah. I always loved it because it was like the name of Bruce Lee's first Kung Fu school that he had when he came to America. Oh really? Yeah, it's really bad ass. And, and so, uh, I uh, I went to their website and they had a bunch of fucking cool shit. And so I bought this, uh, this old school Gracie academy one and then I got this one on right now. All the one I'm wearing right now. So this was a Hixon versus uh, Kimora or excuse me, not Hixon Helio Hickson Hickson at the main guy that the originator, excuse me, helio a versus a Kimora from 1951. That's cool. Gear Gracie, close zero, zero. Yeah. You had some tap out shit you used to.

Speaker 3:          01:16:26       Every now and then. And then I, when I, when I saw a homeless guy wearing a tap out shirt might be too mainstream now. I saw a homeless guy in the Ed hardy shirt. Yeah. Yeah. Some old guy today cheer me on. I went through a red light. They just did this great space coaster. No, I thought it was going to look like I'm taking them out to another dimension I was going to go through. It's like yellow. I'm like, Nah, I'll just run this. When you wearing that sweater that was wearing this way and he like, he starts doing this pump and as I go through he goes, gets hit the fingers and I was like, yeah man, here's your text.

Speaker 2:          01:17:00       It makes you think that they saw a homeless guys probably could have been kind of cool in any other era. Maybe they might not have been homeless, you know, maybe if they grew up in the 60s they would have

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       skated through and actually doing that are okay. It'd be a hundred percent homeless. There's a lot of people becoming homeless now though. Man, this is a tricky time. Is it? There's more homeless people now. I bet. Yeah. Well there's actually people that I know that our homeless like comics and it kind of creeps me out. I don't want to say like couch surfing. Yeah. That's not really homeless. Not having a house is a little and it sucks when you have one of those guys that lives in your house, you'd never going to get them out. It makes me sad, especially since a couple of them are girls and was like, Oh you poor girls. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:17:45       oh Brian getting dark on it. You put that up there on purpose to hopefully go track cause that's, that's scary. That's scary because this couch surfers, they must have stinky ass pussy. It's don't you think because they probably don't want to use the shower as much cause they don't want to like get him people's hair and there's, you know what I mean? They wake up early and probably go out for the day. You girls, you're talking. Yeah. Yeah. People that couch. I've never had a couch surfer. I would just imagine that they would want to leave and get out of your hair and not really buggy. Okay. So someone was only crashing couch. They don't have a bedroom in your house. You know, like I've only had people stay at my house. Well I kind of had my friend John, he stayed on my couch for a little bit back in New York.

Speaker 4:          01:18:19       But the most of the people that have stayed with me, they had, they stayed in that extra room. I was there for a week. Yeah. Dunkin and Tate lived here. Tate lived here for months. But it's great. It's great to, you know, if you have a friend who stayed with you and it's only for a short period of time, it's cool. You know? Like I loved having both those guys here. It was fun. It was cool. You know, just have a buddy, you come home, your buddies watching TV at your house. Well you have a good house for it. It's nice. It's segmented those with me when it comes to town. Yeah. He's a great guy. Smart. Like excited about it. Yeah, it's fun. Yeah, it'd be quite a little bit. Bert and Tom Segura except they have frame release. You're fucked. I know. Like they'd be the Mommy and the mom and dad and you'd stay out.

Speaker 4:          01:19:02       So mean, just live with them. Live with them roommate, if you could bring to a marriage, it's up to make it happen. Get to go on. I have to do is break them up. They're happily married and shit, but whatever. They don't even know what's best for them. I did a podcast with Christina because it's going to, I thought I lost, I thought deleted it by accident before he marked up. Oh, she's funny as fuck man. That's Thompson girl, his wife for the, uh, did you guys kiss? We got an apartment. We did not kiss. Did you ask her? Smell it. I did ask her to smell it. So don't want to talk real quick. No, no. My finger. Good. If you do, do you still do that bit about the doctor, but uh, getting you checked out. Never made it. It never made it, you know, that's why I need to record an album.

Speaker 4:          01:19:44       I forgot about that. I forgot about that. Are you, can I tell you, yeah, go for our, we had this bit where he would, uh, did you have, was she an attractive woman? Doctor was an Asian doctor. Attractive woman. Doctor was looking at his dick because he had like some sort of lesion on it. Something, yeah, something going on. And he just thought for a second about grabbing the back of her head while she was down on our knees looking at us and he, and then he goes like, oh, you like, she would be like, oh, finally a real man.

Speaker 4:          01:20:14       I like, but I was like, I don't want to cause you're going to be mad. But like what if she'd be into it? We got the opportunity. The problem. That's what kept Clinton alive during those fucking leg. The lower house. Yeah. Just whipping it out. Yeah. How many of the presidents you think would like that? You know, there's a, Oh, there's a book coming out that says Nixon's gay. Not only is it gay, really did, they'd name the guy he was gay with. He had a longterm relationship with this one man. And he, he took it with this guy with him everywhere. There's a really cute Latino guy. He took the guy with them everywhere. That's possible. I totally see that. She playing him. I barely remember when Liberace sort of like it was like he's got aids or no, no, no, not Liberace. That other guy rock Hudson.

Speaker 4:          01:20:58       Yeah, and people are like, what? That's how I remember it. Was he super good beforehand? If he's just real handsome. It was a real handsome movie star, like the, you know, the early days and I think people just never believe no. So there must be God's like that, like an office to of course. Just so you just don't want to think about it because of the times. It's like, yeah, they're pretty short nursing. This guy's pretty sure he's going on a limb on this Nixon thing, but George Washington got a lot of photos of George Washington's leave that spread it, spread it can shared a bed with a man was common back then. The rusty trombone common, now it's called homosexuality. They were cold as fuck in the Lincoln was living in a fucking house made out of sticks. No, that's right. Built his own fucking house. Does that much with weather proofing.

Speaker 4:          01:21:41       Yeah. Well, if you had a lot to sleep at one president, who would it be? Clinton. I bet he knows how to slide deck. That's good. He might be willing to bring some girls in the equation, you know? Listen man, you could fuck me, but can we get some girls too? Shit. I was always attracted growing up to Andrew Jackson just because of his hair and yeah, on the $20 bill, it was kind of cool. Well, Washington, Tony White teeth, like these crazy fake teeth. What do they call it? Black and we'll have them cops. No, he had dentures. Oh really? Yeah, they were, you know, like one of the first early dentures he had, you know, they, they didn't take care of their mouths back then and the people's mouths, their teeth would run out of their fucking head. They didn't know anything then. No, ain't no shit.

Speaker 4:          01:22:20       If you had appendicitis, you would just die in bed dead. No one else in the list. It comes on within a week. You're dead. You're not. They, you know, was witchcraft. Oh, all these people are allergic to peanuts and all that, but with, you know, they just die off. Oh, to our, our art, our technologies overcome nature's way of getting rid of those people. I mean, look, do the meek shall inherit the earth. I mean that as a quote is, it sounds silly. It sounds biblical, it sounds like, oh yeah, sure they will, but what do you mean physically meek, but mentally strong, physically weak, but able to manifest all sorts of incredible things out of technology. That's really what's going on and in manifesting all these incredible things out of technology, they've, the body has less, less requirements

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       physically. So they become meek, they become meek and their computers and technology becomes strong and they inherit the there. It's that simple. But that's really what's happening and it's what's going to happen. And along the way, they're going to figure it out. Cures to every fucking disease as people are alive or, or the strong people would just start bashing the fuck out of the smart people. That's possible too. That's possible too. But then eventually they would breed smart people. We're going to have a middle state right now because I wouldn't say it's the smartest people controlling the world right now. It's just the comments as far as people that ever been the smartest cunts. Oh yeah. But they're cuts the really smart people like Bill Gates and you know, they're not really controlling the world. I mean, they have a massive business and everything like that, but they're not directing, you know, overseas campaigns to get these minerals and fuck off curing malaria.

Speaker 2:          01:23:54       Yeah. Fucking great things. Great things. Just donating billions of dollars. It's an amazing how it, like Steve Jobs always got the reputation as being like the cool guy. He was like green and great for the world. Meanwhile, Bill Gates was, he got out there donating money for schools and don't feel like he was crazy humanitarian shit. Malaria research institute or whatever it's called. Go like we're done without him. As soon as he stopped giving, we're out. It's amazing. Have you seen his house? Oh No. The battle. What's it like? Ooh. Oh my God. What's it like? There's a desire for it online. It's fucking incredible. It's built. First of all, he has a submarine. That's what I said. He's got a door underneath his fucking house where he can like open up and bring the fucking submarine.

Speaker 3:          01:24:41       Sure. It's just not crazy like it opens, he can bring it in a bucket and those old Nazi lab shows or whatever. When they came in, hope I didn't make the site. It's crazy. Yeah. I got a door. It's incredible. State of the garage

Speaker 2:          01:24:55       for submarine. Yeah. It's on like a sad, it's not a sound, it's all like the ocean or something like that and it's this amazing fucking house, like the top of the lung technology in every room you walk in, you wear a pendant and the Pender gives your, your particular id out to all these different sensors. So as you enter a room, your particular lighting comes on, 10 was to your temperature, your mood, your music starts playing. So wow, that's pretty cool. That's what I'm saying. So you leave one romantic tailgates, his house. Oh

Speaker 3:          01:25:33       yeah, you are such a case. I was thinking about which President Bill Gates is like that we were talking about. I know, but I was talking, I was thinking, I was still thinking about which president did that happen. The Pot. Sometimes if I'm talking to somebody and they'll be yapping in my mind we'll just go elsewhere and I'll be like, hey, can you back up a second? I didn't hear any of it. I see. I was thinking like JFK because, but I don't know if it was just like the Instagram colored look of all the film that you see JFK and it's kind of cool. But I think I would see Lincoln just for that cause that's

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       of course meet with Lincoln. JFK would probably the most likely to fuck you. Who was living in Korea you time. We're allowed to fuck any of them. They want to care. Apparently it was like the biggest freak of all time. I already had a couple thoughts down. Physically fuck them. Fuck them. Fuck you. I thought, Oh, you got to fuck them. Fuck them. Oh. Then Grover Cleveland, one of those fat guys. I'm going to fuck my Nigga Nixon, Nixon, Nixon. Well I tried to get the secrets. Fuck them. Now. Which one would you want to make love with a Lincoln freed the slaves and he probably had already had experience with men. Right? Ra, what about you? I mean like we're trying to last as long as we can. Right. What you made when you want to fuck you and everyone will enjoy this moment. Going condom or no condom.

Speaker 4:          01:26:52       We find spread out. This is love, Bro. Love plus there were barely any ears back then. There were letters, diseases, but get a scrape yourself free if you have something, what did you do? I don't know. You'd to reach up there with the guides isn't it? Didn't uh, Al Capone, didn't he die? Syphilis? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Syphilis would kill people. If you ever seen like pictures of people who have like really like a longterm, like advanced syphilis. Horrible. Disgusting. Yeah. It's an evil disease. It's crazy. We give each other diseases by fucking, it really is. It's like it just attacks that area. Like a lot of them. That's the only way to get it. You don't get herpes by shaking hands, you know? But you can get it flew by shaking hands, shook a hand. You've product code. You should [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          01:27:37       You actually touched a herpes dick or her pedic peanuts. You be fine if you had a cut on your finger. No, you don't hand herpes. Yeah, you're right. There's no hand herb. You sure you can? No, you wouldn't get it in your hand. Lipson Dick Lipson deck. It's weird. It has to be like an open, why would that cause those areas, the genital herpes, that's all over the place sometimes, right? No, just in your genitals. Really. Just general like in your legs too and there's actually in your eyeball. Yeah, there's, there's a type of it and got a forehead to shingles too, which is like another, like an advance of herpes. Yeah. It's different kinds of her thinking is shingles cordon off. Yeah. They cook those. But then you have that juice inside you forever. You had fucking bomb bomb that Obama, I think I just see Ra being wanting it.

Speaker 4:          01:28:23       Oh, [inaudible] off my back so much. Did you see the video of the guy who claimed that he was Obama's lover and that they had shared oral sex and no real, is he in Chicago? Yeah. You ever heard this guy? Pull it up, pull it up. I could see Obama's gay lover just pull up, uh, confessions. Obama's gay or Gay Obama lover. Yeah. The guy was so ridiculous and he's got a nice house. Does he? Confession of the Obamas k lover? He was, uh, they were interviewing him about it and he, uh, it's just so ridiculous. He's, yeah, that's the guy is Larry Sinclair.

Speaker 7:          01:29:02       You can have, first of all, you got to see Obama instead. This is a giant Apatow movie. Springs Colorado to Chicago on November 2nd, 1999 arriving in our hair early in the morning of November 3rd, I went to the Chicago area to attend the graduation. Of My Godson, my best friends, and from basic training from the Great Lakes naval training facility. I made reservations at the Comfort Inn and suites in Gurnee, Illinois based solely on the location to the training center. On November 5th, 1999 I hired the services of Fivestar limousine, Wiener, and guides me a lot of details and this guy still hired, hired them both for November 5th or November 6th and November 6th, 1999 I asked the limo driver whose name I now really have for the first time, Jack Pepper, me who? Connie. Anyone who would like to socialize and show me Chicago. Most of them are totally understood that I was looking for someone who knew Chicago and would enjoy socializing. Tiny said he knew someone who was a friend of his on November six 1999 after picking me up at the hotel and Gurney, and this is significant, Mr he used his cell phone to make a call. That call was me to then Illinois state Senator Barack Obama. Go set up an introduction between myself and Senator Obama. So on a sailing at the bar and setting the limits in it or is he claiming and I was just,

Speaker 5:          01:30:31       can you just hit the space bar? It doesn't work. Yeah. Um, well hold on. Yeah, which has happened. The guy saying that he fucked up Obama and so we gave all those details in order to do like an idiot be corroborative or like say like, well you can give all those details cause he's a moron. But yeah, it was such a long, it's part of the storage. Hell Buddy. Well I'm also doing a press conference. You have 20 minutes to kill you think so. This guy called this, he got his limo driver to call. Hey, show me some good. Okay, good. Dick and Obama was like, man, you, you let me know when someone's looking for Dick. Oh you tried to limo. And I'm a senator and I'm thinking about being a president, but if you see some of this, I don't abandon all that shit.

Speaker 5:          01:31:08       It just takes the guy's nuts. [inaudible] the guy he reeks of being foolish and he's not just like we had a relationship in college. It's like, these are crazy. He's a random like, call me up and I'll just fuck somebody that's maybe, yeah. I mean, the story is so preposterous. What if it was around, do you think he took a Abe Lincoln? Was the vampire sounding lessons from the Republican convention like us act like us? That's what everyone, Obama, I don't believe that it's real, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was real. Yeah, because look at what happened with Clinton, who would have ever believed that there was a president and he was, you know, in his 50s and he was, you know, in the White House and he was having a 20 year old girl, blonde. They shooting loads on her dress and want to believe that nobody poppers starts talking a cigar in and out of her. I'm going to believe that he would have thought she would've kept her mouth shut. I mean, come on,

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       dude. It was the other one dragged her in, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow. Yeah. There'll be front. Think about that position that he was at. The president of the United States is literally at the top of the food chain of human beings on the planet as far as the most prestigious position in the world, in the world, period. I mean it just is how much you love being from Ireland or England or wherever you're from. Top 10 that guy, the president of, even if you don't respect president, put pub capture orders and the president of bombs, president, president, and in control the military. This is no, no comparison. Pope's a joke compared to some religious nuts though. It gets those chicks, they could them with bombs. Oh yeah. If there was a war between though, it's more between the president of public president wins every time.

Speaker 2:          01:32:42       He just sends all those pictures saved up for years of all those guys getting their dick sucked by little boys. They just release those all over the Internet and there's a massive campaign against the Vatican would immediately, if there was ever a position where the United States went to war with the Vatican, we wouldn't use bombs who'd use pictures of them blowing his horn and more of those. Over the five year period. They didn't have to be real man. You mean how many fucking Photoshop artists are there that worked for the military? Luckily there's plenty that they can find that are real, that was her constantly doing. I'm sure all you have to do a sit and hidden cameras up or fall, these fox, wherever they go, and you've got to find a certain percentage of a, really, all you have to do is give them all flip phones and I'm sure someone will just record themselves.

Speaker 2:          01:33:21       Well, you know, I've heard it argued on the online especially, and it's really a fucking potent argument, that worry argument that the entire Catholic religion at its highest levels exists for all these gay guys. I believe that coming up at the highest level, not just covered it up and sent the guy in the way covered up and sent him to, to write more kids and it's, yeah, it's a culture that's from the vedic. A lot of them accepted a lot of the boys except the position. So a lot of the boys like it and so they think that it's good. They think that they're doing a good thing they did. There's literally things that Ratzinger saw Ratzinger. Who is the guy who was the pope right now? Pope Benedict is real. You might hit the Hitler youth. No big deal, but there's, there's letters by this fucking guy that this guy had under his review where um, these cardinals or bishops or what are the fuck they were, we're actually specifically targeting boys that had come from broken families.

Speaker 2:          01:34:18       He was, they were asking for boys from broken cars and wanting people to, couldn't fight back as much, anywhere to go. They didn't have a family that they can call him from beat your ass. Those are the people choosing how you act in your religion. Lent, how long that lasts and what you have to do this year, whether or not condoms are legal, those are the people chosen. You can't be Catholic anymore. Dirty, silly bitches. You just can't, you're not a Christian. It's so dumb. It's all dumb. But Catholicism is one of the worst. That's, it's a cult of people who are dressed up like fucking Jeanie's. They're dressed up like these crazy wizard outfits with giant fish head hats and, and they're waving golden warns. It's 2012 and these assholes are dressed up like they're like a fucking Harry Potter character. I mean, it's preposterous. The idea that that still exists, then we still take that seriously.

Speaker 2:          01:35:13       My God, that's incredible. I mean it's, it's really incredible. And you know, people go, oh, you're so ignorant. You know, you hate religion, you hate I, I hate everything that stinks like shit. And that shit up. It goes against them. If he's a guy, you want to have to give people fucking birth control. If we're Christian, it's like, Oh, if I'm Jewish, I don't have to let people get Bacon with the money I give them. What are you arguing about? What all the fucking Christians don't let anyone do anything. They think they run. Everything can get birth control to art, to, to, to girls. Because there's a lot of Catholics don't want to have to offer that to people. Well, Catholics think did birth control is actually bad. So then don't take it. The pope tells you that you're not supposed to be using condoms, you're not supposed to be using birth control.

Speaker 2:          01:35:57       You're supposed to be having sex for procreation only. Yeah, so that's why they should do. And he said nothing to do with what your employees need. That's why boys have a boy pussy. If you're a Christian scientist, you can't deny all healthcare to your, to your workers because you don't believe in healthcare. Yeah, well there's just don't do it himself. There's certainly that. That's certainly a problem if you're an employer, but I think overall the real problem is that it's an ideology and it's an ideology that's based on just some shit that's written down. And the idea that there's a god is not a preposterous idea. If you look at the underlying code of the universe, it's really the whole Fibonacci sequence. That's it. Reoccurs in nature over and over again. This, this constant drive towards going to flexing. It may be very well be complete coincidence or it may be that there's some sort of an impossible to decipher grand plan to it all and it might not be a deity and it's in it as far as how we look at it, like, uh, being a person, we, you know, we, we anthropomorphize size.

Speaker 2:          01:36:53       That's what it was to be doing. We didn't have an animal and you put it in a human context. I mean, whatever, however you would describe that. Putting a God a deity into a human context, I think that's ridiculous. I think the idea of it even being remotely like our consciousness is ridiculous, but it's not ridiculous that there's some sort of a higher order. It doesn't, it doesn't seem to me, but what's ridiculous is all these stupid old stories that everybody's based in their life on circumcise and kids and not, and pork. And you know, what are you talking about? No water during the day crews for this. You can do it if you want, but don't fucking tell anyone else to oh, cares what anyone else does. They don't have to do your shit. Yeah, it's stupid. That's what it is. It's dumped. But the problem is the EU. There's a lot of people out there that really have a hard time thinking for themselves and they are happier when someone comes along and they offer them a predetermined pattern they can follow. That's why religion works for a lot of people. All right, so do it yourself. Don't force on it. Anybody else. It's stupid. But do it yourself if you want to do it. And then I think the problem with data is that when someone's doing something,

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       they want other people to do it too. It's like when dudes go vegan and they get douchey with you, how many times a year for that APP, but they're happy that you're not vegan. Sometimes they're happy that they can look down on you. And some where I've had guys like, come on, man, you really need to try this. You really need to come on, man. I'm like, so you didn't need to get the fuck away from me. Well, if I don't eat these animals, so they're going to live forever, so I'm going to happen. They're going to cure cancer. You stupid. Fuck. What are you saying? You're not going to kill animals. What if, what if plants would scream when you cut them down, would you still eat them? What if they made like a, as you cut the lettuce off the out of the ground, what if it every freaking, yeah, would you be upset? What if they loved it?

Speaker 4:          01:38:38       But there's a something when someone becomes something, when they become a Republican, when they become a windows user, when they switched over to sprint, they want you to do it to everybody is a lot of people that are weak like that man, they feel better when everybody else is doing the same shit they're doing. If they're dressing like Johnny Cash, they want everybody else address like Johnny Cash to it. You could tell them like, like literally this is the only car that fits into my car port, but you need to buy American Bro. Why you or they're like, it's a cohort over Chevy Ford guy, Bro. That was for a lot of side to side when you were saying earlier, I'm a Ford Guy. Brow always bail for guide till I die. You know it's funny, as Ford escorts, remember how gross that car he used to be and it was a whole, it's like the grossest car ever scored.

Speaker 4:          01:39:23       That was before escorts were escorts back then. They were prostitutes. They called after it. They were still escorts. They look done. Have you ever attempted to natural know things like that? Temple, the Tabernacle, a tempo it and ask what, did you ever have an escort? I don't know. I never got, I never got an escort Taurus's and sell a car. You for Ford is the only company that didn't take money from the government and his bail outs and then they're still doing great. Who paid them back or when something already just pay them fully back. No, it's not true. No, we did try to say that they paid them back fully, but there's apparently, there's a lot of funky malarkey that I don't understand it. I'm not a financial guy, but the way it's been explained to me, it's like, no, they're clearly taken away the idea that we have any say in it.

Speaker 4:          01:40:09       So it's like, all right, let's, let's actually find out so that we don't misinform people auto bail out, bail out payback, right? What your mouth is agape, it's done and you're about to murmur. I liked it. [inaudible] you know what the hell is Tom is a house like that and I can't hear it. Here's why. Here's the issue. But while we're still on the subject, because I did know that there was something wrong about this. In the Washington examiner, they have an argue. They have an article rather the truth behind Chrysler's fake auto bailout payback. And apparently there's a lot of fucking funny accounting of how they, yeah. American taxpayers have already spent more than 13 billion bailing out Chrysler. The Obama administration already forgave more than 4 billion of that debt. When the company

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       filed for bankruptcy. Tax payers are never going to get that money back, but how is Christ are going to pay off the rest of the 7.6 billion? They own the Treasury Department. The answer is the Obama administration's bailout agreement with Fiat gave the Italian car company in tremendous incremental call option that allows it to buy up to 16% of Chrysler stock at a reduced rate. But in order to exercise that option first it had a payback at least 3.5 billion of the loan to the Treasury Department. So fee it's, it's, it's all like that is renting them. Exactly. It's not, it's not like Chrysler became ballers and paid all the money back and I'm like, thanks. It worked. There's a, there's a lot of other shit going on behind the scenes. People are buying things and selling things. You should be, are we should fear. I would, I would love it if America made all the best shit.

Speaker 2:          01:41:45       You know? I mean, I would think it would be amazing if we could pull out of this and all of a sudden make fucking bad ass cars and shit. I would like to support that. I, you know, when we buy, if you buy a German car, you know that those people, they're not slave labors, you know. But if you, if you buy a car, like if they started selling cars that are made in China like Foxconn and starts making cars, that's a tricky situation of being. I would re rather pay more if I could afford it. Of course. Obviously we rather pay more if I knew that the people who made my car got a good wage, wouldn't you?

Speaker 3:          01:42:16       I, I've always bought Fords. I like for zoning. Got Ford Mustang next. I think that or a charger. I, I've, I've always bought Fords except Ford boy. Yeah, I know. It's a Chrysler. I known it's Chrysler is full of Shit. Did you hear what I just, it looks nice. They look dope. The charges

Speaker 2:          01:42:31       best shapes out there. They nailed it. They, they, they made a modern version of the 1970s in 1960s muscle car. They did it. They fucking nailed it. They nailed it with the Camaro to the new Camaro. Nailed it. I saw crazy looking red one with black stripes.

Speaker 3:          01:42:45       It's a yellow one the other day. It with driving one. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. They're great shit. I wouldn't buy yellow car though. I wouldn't buy that car. Yeah, there's something about a yellow car and it just, man, it's hard to prove you're not a douche bag orange man. I've got Nacho orange, at least all the Mexicans love me, but it's like creepy orange all the best at what you call it. The orange is what Ari cause it. Fiesta all is. It feels like a fiesta. It's like going getting a Doritos. It's like, I'm trying to think. Did they just had like an extra gallon of that paint? I think so. That's why it got it so cheap because it was that color, but now I want to, I want to murder that car.

Speaker 3:          01:43:22       That car was great. Brian, you have a great car. American car also. That's amazing. It's nice. It's about as nice as it gets except for the new Cadillacs. The new Cadillacs are just about the best American cars that have ever been built. Yeah, there's some new Cadillac CTSV and CTSV coop it you're you're in blade runner. The Romeos. None of those is nine of them, I'm sure. Okay. So this boyfriend through catalogs from, you're trying to relate to the euro's auto workers. Oh really? Did he really say that? It goes, in fact, I own an cars at my wife

Speaker 4:          01:43:51       drives a Cadillac. In fact, she drives two Cadillac's and you see all his, if I was going, God damn it, you stupid fast. What can you say one you'd dumb cunt. He also said this at the same thing. He goes, he goes, I love auto racing. I've always loved, obviously we've been a big fan. A lot of my friends are owners of why you're killing us. Hey, do you want to go racing? If you ever, uh, kind of two race cars, go around a track. Remember that? What's it called? Place? Did you go in that? What a called place? Oh, Atlanta and Atlanta to uh, yeah, argues with me when we did a, yeah, I went around the track. We, um, I uh, did some sort of a hosting thing for a mini Cooper versus Porsche challenge as a race that they had in a really close circuit.

Speaker 4:          01:44:35       So like the big engine of the Porsche didn't allow it to overtake the mini Cooper, which was speed. It was all just about agility and real usable speed. It's pretty fucking impressive that a mini Cooper was only like a couple of seconds behind a Porsche in this, this race around these cones. I love those guys too. They're like, yeah, they're like, are you guys going to win? And they're like, we'll see. And then they didn't, they didn't think they were going to win. They're like probably not. They didn't even, they just made a little party for their owners. Well they didn't even get the sport version mini Cooper, but not, they had a wagon wagon one that's actually really have a regular version apparently. Like they had like all the people from like the mini Cooper clubs and all that shit come down. And there's people that get fanatic about those cars, just like clubs and Shit there apparently the most fun to drive and had a barbecue.

Speaker 4:          01:45:18       They invited any mini Cooper owner to come out and you just get free barbecue. I got a chance to drive it a little bit, but it was only around this, you know the small course, but it's there. They're like real agile, a little cars. They're like, it's like a go cart. It's like you're so, it's so small and so light, you know? It's like there's something fun in that man. So what's this? I just got, I remember got just got so high, I was like, you were like, I got to work. So you do whatever you want it to. It just get obliterated in Atlanta. We got obliterated as fuck that day. Remember how hot it was? Sweltering Royce. The Atlanta gets that crazy funky. Huh? Wait, so when are you going to racing? I don't know. I have a friend who uh, I mean they're not, I don't want to like have a competition or anything like that.

Speaker 4:          01:45:57       Just go around quick check that box. You put chicken line too in Burbank. They have adult go kart, indoor adult go kart track. And I was thinking like that'd be pretty cool. Great. They can, you're doing that. I guess it got really fast. The owner of the, how fast do they go? I don't know. Whenever the ice house does it. Okay, let's do that. Yeah. You know there's a laser tag place up here too. They still have laser tag 12 year old kids. Look at what point we should do. All those things don't card. You should do all those bags. Shoot guns. I ain't fault. I have, I love shooting in Israel, which to do that. Let's go shoot guns. I shoot fish in a barrel, put fish up and then try to shoot fish like dead fish. Why don't you do that? So I used to be taught things at target.

Speaker 4:          01:46:36       You did pick a gross, the American oh Derek Carr. Guns into the air. Guns in the air. Just shoot him like pull and just throw a official like put them like on like a target. And then she tried to blow up with fish. Oh, throw him in the air and then try to shoot him out of the sky. No shooting with Sean Miller in Indianapolis. Yeah, it was so much fun. Yeah, it was great fun pull. And you just bought it. And when you see it explodes. Ah, yeah. It's like, I mean even when you play pool and you make it, you know, he makes fine ball and everyone hangs out that they have it. Like they like a pro like area, you know, everyone hangs out just like, just like in pool people would hang out or any place where he'll just chill a golf room.

Speaker 4:          01:47:18       I have a buddy Justin, these uh, they, they have like competitions where you'd go through a maze. Like things come up, like when you blast them and you get like a score and then you go like after you sold the area. Well this is bullets. Yeah, that was, that was the cop. What was the cop cop movies. Oh yeah. You killed, you killed a civilian again. Yeah. Gibson, there's a lethal weapon. The funny ones. But Berg attorney hitch with City, Gothenburg, Gutenberg. There were five police police academies. Yeah. They had to go through those courses. Yeah. Steve couldn't burn Tackleberry who died. There was this thing about Halloween that ate what you would pay money and they had like a hundred people dressed up as zombies anywhere on top of the building and now they all just start coming towards you and it's paint ball and you just shoot them charged.

Speaker 4:          01:48:04       Oh yeah. So they just like, it's like you're not just false warmed by trends. It was in Santa Monica. They wanted us to come down and cause we were gonna have him on the pot. It's like what do they do when they get ahold of you? You just shoot them. They're slowly climbing up, you know, and you just, and then they have to fall when they get shot. I don't know. I didn't do it. So they're slowly coming in on you like yeah, they're hoarding you. It was like call of duty zombies. They're eventually going to have a game like the world's most deadly game. Remember that movie? The deadliest game? Whenever it was, I think there was what they redid it with Gary Busey also. It was hunting them ice tea was the one being hunted. Oh yeah. That's when I see him like crazy dreadlocks.

Speaker 4:          01:48:49       Yeah. But there was an old version of it. It's like the deadliest games really old. It was like a Russian military guy who was like crazy and Dupre talked to every thought. These people, there's island then when hunt them down. And the reason why I, um, well I remember this because I've been watching this show called naked city. Have you seen the show and not that one? Oh, hidden city, sorry. Not Negativity. Hidden city, hidden cities. All this Marcus Shacki guy, he's a um, uh, crime novelist and he goes to all these different towns and finds out like the really fucked up stories in this town. Like all the crazy murderers and shit that hasn't, that haven't been solved. And one of them was a dude who would pick up hookers and he would take them in a plane and Alaska picked him up, put him in us, handcuffed him, put him in his plane and then fly them to an island and let them loose.

Speaker 4:          01:49:36       And then he would go and hunt them. Really? He brought it would bring a rifle and he would let them loose and just go, you better run. You better run around. I'm coming after you bitch. And then he would go after, I mean hunting, we track them down. They'd be like in the snow. So it'd be like tracking them. Yeah. But it was like the thrill of actually tracking them. Fucking blow him away. And then he would keep their, um, their licenses and shit. And that's how they caught him. What do we want it to his attic attic. He had driver's licenses of all these different women that he killed because they had searched his place once. They couldn't find anything and they had a search place again. And uh, when they searched this place again, they found it in the attic. I shouldn't keep mentos they can't help themselves.

Speaker 4:          01:50:14       They tell us people want to be competent. I think that's what it is. I think they just like keeping them or mentos well, they look back at those momentos and they, they have, they get excited trophies. Yeah. I don't think it's like, I'm looking to get caught though. You think you're looking not to and keep these things, you get more complacent than what you do it. I blamed my mom. She always had like that book when you're a kid and I had like little lock of your hair and stuff like that and I always was attracted like law locks of hairs, you know, with the girls that I date. What would you ever, would you ever, if it was on the menu, would you try human meat? No. No, you would never do it. It's supposed to taste just like pork. Really? Yeah. And you can always eat pork.

Speaker 4:          01:50:47       So why would I try human meat? I don't want to know what that tastes like. Apparently though, obviously would, it must be distinguishable because uh, well you can go to Liberia and you can get some crazy anymore. The worst. I know the war's done, so they're not serving any more human meet. Charlie Charles Taylor was in the Hague. Charles Taylor's, the guy was the, the, the horrible war criminal crazy fucking name. Charles Taylor. Yeah. Sounds like the guy who had created peanuts, they destroy their own infrastructure there. Would they need to like stuff to tie people up with slate? Just he was like telephone wire. They would cut it down and just use that. She sort of like, oh now we have no telephone lines. Jesus Christ, if that's their rockets out. So they're like, let me just show you how much I can blow this thing up and then you show me how much that rock can blow his damn. They blow up. Blow up down. They're so stupid. The whole, the the Liberia. So frightening. And the fact that it used to be a u s slave colony. Really? Yeah. That's how it started. It's all better now. Slaves came from Liberia.

Speaker 4:          01:51:44       Yeah. Wow. It's better now. In what way? Charles tells gone or trying to like redo everything. Mass Man. They had the vice guide to Liberia. It was pretty recent. They were over there. It's still crazy. Yeah. This is parts of the world where, how the fuck do you fix Africa? Look at all the different like look at you gone to look at it. I mean that's a long, long, long project. They wanted to give juice. You're going to get them Jewish. They wanted to give the Jews Uganda instead of Israel. So listen, figure this place as a lot of talk about that. When was this? 60 no, no, no, no. Wait before that, I guess the forties and thirties the war Israel, after the war they were like, we need to give him some place to go. Clearly we've shown enough times, we just explain to me how the whole Israel thing worked because at one point in time Palestinians live there, but no Jews live there already. Like a bunch of different migrations. Well Jews live there and Arabs live there a long time ago and then one of the Roman kings came and like dispersed. The Jews killed him. Yeah, well no, just like say extinguished

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       something like go to Europe, go to Africa. Just go pick them all out here. What you've, what year was this? This we're talking about like um, this is way after Jesus I think. I think because Jews were around when Jesus was there way after Jesus and after one temple was destroyed, then the Jews wouldn't go back until they rebuilt the second temple. Then I did. Then they came back when that was a story and they kicked out, like they slowly started coming back here or there. So like in 1910 it was a big migration. 1912 big migration of, of European Jews to Israel. What temple was it where the Romans got all the way up to the top and the Jews Massada what? There wasn't a temple. It was, it was it last enclave of defense. They were resisting. So when did they do, what was the store?

Speaker 5:          01:53:32       They uh, went up there. It was one of those things that one of the Roman kings built for like the getaway, a sweet, sweet getaway. Um, it's really awesome actually. They have these, these um, hot baths and they would like empty out like the part of mountain underneath. It's like a heat it, up until then we come up with the ceilings were curved down because they knew that if they were flat, the water drops put like hit and just like form. And that hit you. That was really unpleasantly minimal curved. So the water would run down the curved ceilings not drip onto you? Um, yeah, just really great design things. But anyway, as the Jews are being pushed out, send, convert or leave or die, I guess some of them, the last defenses like push back to there and they realized they could just like, there's only one way up.

Speaker 5:          01:54:16       So they just, they can just shoot down arrows at people at the Romans. They couldn't get up there, um, until they started using Jewish slaves as human shields, uh, and then started marching up. But also they are, they had enough food and water to last them for like so long. So they will wait you out. We'll just wait you out for years. And they just had him surrounded like that, that much, that much supplies. And then eventually when I think the human slaves, right then they were like, all right, but we're not going to kill our own. So what are we going to do? And I think they are just, they all kill each other. Well, we're not going to kill her own, so we'll kill our own will just help commit suicide. We're dead anyway. So did they commit suicide when they use these swords?

Speaker 5:          01:54:51       Right? So words. Is that what it was? A lot of it wasn't it? Where were they? Get poisoned. It wouldn't be poison. Poison. Yeah. I don't know that it was when it was done in a very primal way. It could be sourced. It could have been swords. And I know like the last guy, I had to do it to himself and then chose who was going to be that last guy. Wow. Go. That's what it is. They didn't want to commit suicide cause you're not going to heaven. So you would kill another person. So you didn't have to kill yourself. Sit alone. I had to commit suicide or he just didn't look at all these juicy Ron at the Romans by cops or go, oh you guys come up this way. I came up back over there. This Jews are all day and that's probably why I choose my clothes. And then, and then, uh, and then times Roman outfits.

Speaker 5:          01:55:38       Wow. What a fucking crazy time to be alive. That must, you had to give them to religion or die. Oh, should be easy. It just shows you that people have always had that weird desire to have everyone else think exactly the way they thought. It makes them feel more secure. Christians more crystallized. It's more Christians did Jews actually never proselytized. That's amazing, isn't it? Yeah. Why is that? Because of your religion? It's just, it's silly as anybody else's based on the same things. Yeah, it was the question. So how come they figured out to like keep to themselves and it said like, you don't have to do this. There's no reason you should if you want to, you can, but we're not going to try to push her. I was like, do whatever you want. The time of David, they outlawed it. Outlawed conversion. Wow.

Speaker 5:          01:56:20       It was too popular. Too popular. But he wanted to be a judge. You just, because it was like they were the ruling party. Really? Yeah. Damn. So they outlawed it. So they said no conversion during this time, John, for how long? Oh No, please. I'm fine. Yeah, I don't know. Now you have to do that. You have to ask a bunch of times. I'm just hanging out. I don't like these people do that. Now. You have to do that. Most of the whites, I don't want to be that ever. You pretty much have to do that. The rabbit, I'll tell you like, don't, don't do this. You don't want to do it really any big macs or can't just trust me. You don't want to do this. He Cuny big MACs. Yeah. If you're a Jew, you can't eat big MACs, religious Jew, you know you're supposed to eat hamburger.

Speaker 5:          01:56:53       Is that what it is? It's not kosher meat and it's cheese on there too. Oh, so just that in general. But you could have kosher beef burgers. You can have a kosher beef burger with, with soy cheese. Oh, the cheese. What is it you can't combine and milk and meat. Is that what it is? What's that all about? Uh, it's, it's pretty much a stupidity, just like all the religions. But uh, it's based on a passage that says you shall not mix the meat of the mother or the milk of the milk of the mother with the meat of the calf. Huh? Yeah. Yeah. Wasn't about sex horn. Instead or anything else? Some sex. Take that just to be that it's, it's that actual mother and calf. Yeah, but that's the case. Why can't you get the milk from the mother and then kill the mother and he heard some milk of the mother and the meat of the mother.

Speaker 5:          01:57:34       That's all right. I don't run it. I'm really good at, it's just they just no meat and milk. You have to wait. If you eat pizza, you have to wait 30 minutes for you meet. What are the odds though, if I have a fucking piece of meat that the milk is gonna come from the same? No, it's not. They said that means they said that passage means don't mix it two at all. Fuck you. Linen and cotton. You can't mix, but yeah, but you can't. If you're, if you have a, if you have like a, a woolen the linen, that's what it is. If you have a wool jacket, you can't have linen things tying in the buttons cause that's evil and you'll go to hell when backing up and go to hell for now. My favorite one, chocolate. My favorite one that you told me to this day was that you were told that when you masturbate for that, people don't really know.

Speaker 5:          01:58:13       Ari grew up extremely religious to the point where he lived. You lived on lives in Israel and your show for two years. Yeah, I mean that's the Torah all day long. 9:00 PM 10 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM I mean, dad is, that's some pretty intense shit and they told you when you masturbated that you were impregnating a demon and the, let's just say you're on your back lying down. They didn't really do positions back then in our shower anyway, but when you're doing it, some demon comes and like, she's like round you, fucking you as you're fucking your hand and then you make like demon babies and they have some writer uses the phage. There was some like maybe it's in coons, everything coons, she use it in a movie or some deep know in a book. There's some, some demon was like riding them and had anyway, but then you get her pregnant and she has babies.

Speaker 5:          01:59:00       Every time you do that, every time you're 100% as babies. Never going to be one on earth, only live in this demon world. Milt have formed and gross. Why? I forgot about this. And then when you get to go to heaven, when you die, you have to meet those demons. Oh my God. And they got, Why dad? Why couldn't we barn on the regular planet? Wow. Why aren't you like this? That so did you mastered with this anyway, even knowing all this, and what did you think was, was this going on? Why you were living in this like really religious environment? You were asking me and you never saw him masturbating. You never stop. I mean, I slowed down. I thought it was evil for doing it. Well, like, so you're doing this, you're there 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM did you think, well that part's bullshit.

Speaker 5:          01:59:43       You, you're studying like this intense religious, well, there's, I think there's two types of sense. Literally this is how it is. There's 2000 since there's, since you plan out and say fuck it. I don't, I don't agree with that. And this types like gossip where it just happens. You're not thinking about it like, fuck, I shouldn't have done that. Right. Talking about about somebody's masturbation is one that just overcomes you, but it's one, I guess it's one that you do plan out because you could just not do it this time. Oh, you accidentally touched it. Women I don't think have the same. It's not theirs. They don't have that backup. Women want to have sex. They get itchy. They want do they want it to be touched? They want affection to get horny. But we have like a backup of sperm where like your Dick is like, come on, let's go.

Speaker 5:          02:00:21       It's like you got to get rid of this shit. Jesus Christ. We can't even think you'd sour milk everywhere here. Come on. What did you, when you beat off, did you like go fuck. What about those babies? Did you believe that part? That part was more like fables is wasn't like the written Torah. So it was like this is what's, this is what like the extra curricular stuff, the ghosts and shit like that. So when would they bring that up? How'd you they barely brought that up. Did they bring it up in class ever? Yeah, we'll come up. We're in discussions with rabbis who studied all that stuff that the uh, the um, the Zahar Zahar which just like the mystical book, but you're not supposed to say that until you're married in 35. What is it? Second Mystical Book said you can't set handle it until you're married and 35 at least set up.

Speaker 5:          02:01:06       It's got all this stuff about ghosts and weird shit. Ghosts. The Olin's is go Siemens and crossing dude Judaism sounds like fun. Sounds like fun. Literate. You don't get to read it very much. I never read the translation to was and so hard. Maybe I should read it. Can you get it online? Can you bobbing by now he's talking about comicon. It's probably all written down somewhere actually, but a lot of it would be the exact language. You wouldn't get that from transition, but you look at clothes. Yeah. There was this piece, there was this one piece and a in the Talmud, which is like a respect of like you're supposed to study apart. And they said this rock, this rabbi went to his students who were living in like a dormitory altogether because there was a s a snake or a dragon that was attacking them every night and killing his students.

Speaker 5:          02:01:47       So he had to sleep and only the rabbi was the one who gets to feed it. So he had to sleep under one of their beds, um, so that he could kill this dragon. It was a dragon. And I asked my rabid about that. I'm like, what the fuck is this all about? Uh, it's my way. What's going on? There's no seconds. Dragons, this is all under this bed to suck your cock. And that's how I killed the Dragon. Yeah, he said there was a rash. It was a rash of jerk offs going on and the only way that he did so they can't really write that out in the Talmud. So they had a metaphor. It was a rash of jerk offs. And the only way I could stop it. It's a rabbi hiding under their bed saying, I call you. You're masturbating. Wow.

Speaker 5:          02:02:23       So the dragon that was killing us it the children was just damn masturbating, desire to masturbate. Oh my God. Their spiritual selves. Holy Shit. That's hilarious. Yet. But it's not written. That metaphor is not explained. It's just, it's just assumed. And you have to ask someone who understands the tax or Rashi would. It looked quite stuff about, if you can understand that, that's so crazy, man. Well, how would that in the future, people would just think it's just craziness. This was an oral tradition too, so it wasn't written down. Someone just had to tell you that story. Wow. That's so they wrote down when they thought they were going to lose it all. That's amazing. Wow. That is a great fucking story. You think I'd be making that up, but I'm really not. It's hilarious. Yeah, there's were so crazy. And people, you know, whenever we have these conversations about religion and so really interesting because I get so many angry tweets [inaudible] get, they get so mad and an idiot.

Speaker 5:          02:03:16       There's literally zero proof for it. There's zero proof ever and there's nothing else in your life that you will entertain a conversation over when there's zero proof, nothing. That's the only thing. If someone tried to invent any of those religions today, you would laugh at them? Yes. You'd say this is a call, but somehow we can't because everyone's involved in it and I just like, it's ridiculous what you're doing. Completely ridiculous. And I say that it's the, it's the enemy of progress because you're not, you don't does that's not on the table anymore. Everything is on the table as far as I mean not is as far as like what is the possibility for the culture? Clothing. I'll real loud. What is subatomic particles? What is, what is, you know what, what are in black holes? Everything is really on the table and and up to discovery until it comes to religion.

Speaker 5:          02:03:59       And what religion that's not on a table, if you, if anything is off the table like that, like stem, stem cell research or things along those lines of religion. Yeah, because of religion, especially when you can get stem cells from skin. I mean, they're at a point now where you don't, you don't need to have embryos. You don't need to encourage people to have abortions like they thought the worst case scenario, whatever it be, that people would be a courage to kill their babies because stem cells from the aborted fetus can be very valuable. That's not even necessary anymore. They've, they've passed that, but we're still human. It's still there because of our belief in a god. Yeah. Yeah. Some of those methods so long ago, it doesn't apply to you anymore. Even if it was invented for a reason, it doesn't apply to you anymore.

Speaker 5:          02:04:36       It's just the ridiculous thing is that if this God did exist, that he wouldn't tell you while you're fucking up left and right and surely setting yourself to house, we're just assigned asshole. Wait there and go. Listen when you get up here, I know this is life has been confusing and everybody's full of Shit and they been telling you these crazy stories, but if you don't listen to them once you get up here, the infinite wisdom is gonna fucking cookie. I got mad at God. I started thinking about this stuff. It was like, what the fuck? So you're telling me that everyone goes to heaven or doesn't or it gets rewarded on the next plane or doesn't based on, you've never been explicit. Just said, I want you to do this and you're supposed to guess it. My Protestant friends where like if you don't accept Jesus, you're going to hell.

Speaker 5:          02:05:13       And I'm like, what's your parents were, were Christian, so you're better chance of accepting Jesus and mine. So just because randomly and my parents were Jewish, I'm going to burn in hell for eternity. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. Like God wouldn't just intervene and say, listen parents, you're teaching your children wrong. This is what I like. I like, I liked him too. If you're a native American a hundred years after Jesus came, you've never heard of him. But if you don't accept that you're going to hell, you had no chance. Yeah. You go to hell, just go to hell. Burn forever for your sin. You know where they say, well, some people will believe that Jesus is actually went to America. And so we'd like told them like one time and the left. And so that was enough of generations. They were Protestant friends tells you, this is the only song so stupid about Jesus and America was the Mormon, the Mormons. They believed that he fucking, he, he was the, uh, that's where the, uh, the American Indians came from. They were lost juice.

Speaker 3:          02:06:08       This, this is it. It's an India. That's how ridiculous. I used to have a joke about it, but I said, but never really formed it. But this is what it was. There's other parts of that same book that say what the Mormons do. I've told you this, right? Yeah. When they said he went to the moon, but with, yeah, with more, with more Hebrew people and start a little race of people called the lunar Syrians. No. Where they still live to this day. No. Yes. Or at least they were saying that until we went to the moon and then we're like, what's up? Like it's the linear. He said, and here's my thing. This is what they, and they didn't answer. They just stopped teaching it, but this is what they said was like, oh, well when we made that up, we didn't think anybody would actually go to the fucking moon. Call us on it. It was like 200 years ago. We're like, oh yeah, we'll take a golden light of the moon and call me on my lie.

Speaker 5:          02:06:55       It's so funny. It's so probably the people, what are they doing up there? What do you think? There's no atmosphere. You know? We didn't know any of that. We didn't know shit. Yeah, more templates. Yeah. Joseph Smith was 14 he founded, understood it. When he said he found that the lost tablets and they say it only he could read because he had a seer stone. He had a magic stone and he was looking at, that's who's going to be the next republican president for county. I believe in all that. Mitt Romney did. You seen the trailer for promethium speaking of ridiculous science fiction movie to move new Ridley Scott movie, the Prequel to alien. Oh no, really don't watch the trailer. They give away just too much going on in the, there's a few spoilers,

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       but God damn does it look good. Ooh, it looks good right now. So she's an innocent man. Charlise the Ron [inaudible]. It's a prequel. Couldn't Charlise that all is the new bad ass chick do it is it looks fucking Trump. I won't watch it then drill it. It looks so good. It's coming out June. My Dick is hard until June. We were talking about with Doug Benson that one time, but trailers, it ruins the, for you. It's the scene. It says you thought it was dead, didn't you? He's not dead. Yeah, they try. They try so hard to get you into the movie. It really pisses off a lot of get solid. Yeah. You fuck heads. You give away huge plot points. There's some movies that it's almost useless to go see them. Like you know what's going to end the first 20 minutes when it's setting up.

Speaker 4:          02:08:22       You're like, I know you're going to become poor. I know how to move. He goes get to it already. I love going to a movie that's supposed to be really good and you don't see any previous four. It's rare that that happens, but man, when it hit, when it does happen, it's great. It happens a lot from you now cause I just download everything so it's like there's no commercials so I can miss commercials for things. Does fucking from atheists like certainly I'd love a good science fiction movie written by, you know when you, when you have Ridley Scott's good at home, it's like come on, this is going to be tremendous. You know, he's really good at, there's not enough of those. They need like avatars every couple of months. You know, something along those lines. Like something that had bad ass, like Taylor, one's terrible ones. Can we for adventures.

Speaker 4:          02:09:01       I thought, I thought, I thought that maybe I was getting cynical because I was like movies aren't good anymore, but I'm like maybe just me getting older. I mean my parents had the same thing. They looked at rotten tomatoes, which is just an amalgamation of all the, you know what it is just, and it was like the last nine box office was like got shitty review. It's kind of under 60% and I'm like, that means nobody likes anything that's out. It's not just me. Terrible movies, man. I know it's hard, especially hard when you've got a bunch of different people involved. Think about how much money it costs to make a movie. Like the Avengers. There's fucking millions and millions dollars on the line as far as like they have to spend and then the potential profit is millions and millions more. So there's so many people with so much saying, trying to say like, don't some male naval gets done.

Speaker 4:          02:09:43       You imagine just this podcast or the way these conversations go. What if we had so many in our ear and every time we started bringing up a certain conversation you'd like cheese it with the, they're the best of the white stuff. I'm stopping started with that. Ari guided the way back up on that. That's what it happens. You know, like, look, I've been doing the UFC for you know how long fucking who knows. Weird to have them. Nine and seven is very rare. Does anybody say anything? But once we started going on Fox, yeah, the, the, the producer who actually had to tell me in my ear, the Fox executives like tell me to take it down a notch. Come take it out. Like when I get excited about something, the way I get excited about it and then, then it's, it's natural and I'm pumping it up and I'm, but I'm people like I'm actually fight. Of course they like it, but these fucking dummy executives, they, the elevator. While you're not saying the Fox ones, I'm saying pretty much a huge group of the huge percentage of the group of people that is in the producer

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       position. A lot of them think that their creative self did it. Guess what everyone's going to be exactly. The most people are going to be fewer turnover. How to deliver the way I deliver. I'm delivery. I've been doing it forever. The like it or they don't. Most people like it. If you don't, tough shit, if it doesn't sound like you're fucking baseball guys, your basketball guys, it's not supposed to. You know, it's not. It's not supposed to. It's a different fucking sport and this is just the way I do it. If I was doing football, I'd probably look you up. Disperse. Yeah. You're lucky on on Chris. Well, I'm lucky I got the job. Really. I'm lucky too, but the whole idea behind going in and like saying, oh, we're going to fix all this and fix all that. Like that's what happens in movies.

Speaker 5:          02:11:12       That's what happens on TV shows. That's what happened. It would happen to this podcast are good at hiring a lighting guy. If we brought in production people and we said, we're going to move the podcasts or studio and butter, he likes you to produce this, just sort of take, take some of the strain away from me. You know, if you're having the same, just talking my ear man. He says, hey man, I'm thinking better. Take digits. Change that subject. This is a bad subject. Could you imagine? You imagine how fucking crazy we would go if you know, if, if, if someone like that there was no Brian moment and someone go, hey man, you guys gotta stop that. You get your papers. I commercial breaks my podcasts. I do commercial breaks. That's so stupid. It's like I'd rather just have a conversation, you know, and now we'll be right back.

Speaker 5:          02:11:52       Well no one's doing it well these commercials. Okay. Cause you're just talking it out. And we do get them out of the way. Bill Birtles that he went on a rant for when he did flowers.com or something. He just wanted to rant of how it, cause it was Valentine's, they come and I was like, Oh, you gotta buy it girlfriend flowers to go to [inaudible] dot com I'll get whatever presented goes. Well that's why the fuck is that still a thing? Oh look, they don't get any enjoyment out of it either. The sex, we have to buy them. That's still, he just goes on this tangent back like, anyway, so I go to flowers.com oh that's perfect. Yeah. That's Sorta sorta how we would do it. Yeah. We never really a way better way to do it. I'm glad he's doing it because it gives he as a comic, he's the same.

Speaker 5:          02:12:27       The way I feel. It's like you don't want to have to say the same thing over and over again. Well, you doing commercials now too. How are you doing your commercials at the beginning of the beginning I'll say what the episode's about. I'll say this stuff into it, my stand up and then the sponsors. But do you do elaborate on the sponsors at all? Like how are you dealing with it until it's like Amazon dealer came Florida and you and you're doing it like a, do you do it like the way we're doing it? Like you just start talking, whatever you feel about that. I'm just like, this is the deal. He bothering people. So I use to express that like I have to hate bothering people, but like anyway, this'll get me money. You know, people have complained about it, but that's just a certain percentage of the people are going to complain about anything.

Speaker 5:          02:13:02       I feel like they used to radio though. And when radio there's tons of commercial all the time. Right? I know we're not the same thing as we know it looks similar, but it is the same thing. It's a conversation. I mean most of these people are listening this thing, they could easily be listening to the radio. It's very simple. Iphones or iPods in their cars is a huge percentage of the people that are listening to this show because everybody has their little hookup. Now. It's so easy to have a USB port every, you know, most new cars like some like forwards. I know your car picks it up Bluetooth so you can out of course you can stream it from your phone. So you, by the way, if you don't have

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       that in your car, there's something that I recently purchased and it's like this thing that you put in your car and it's got three speakers and you'd just goes right on your visor and it automatically connects Bluetooth Connect to Bluetooth that once and uh, it can either stream music to it and also you can take calls on it. So if you don't have it in your car, I got this for I think $129. I'll put it on my website. But it's, it's good. We'll have that like a lot from like from like a phone to the car if they have, if it's a music phone. Right. And in California it's the law. Like I know in Ohio you're still fucking driving around and making phone calls, but like a lot of places you can't do that anymore. Yeah. You get tickets. So people looking for people,

Speaker 5:          02:14:12       well on phones, every day, text when you shouldn't got damaged. Drives me crazy when I see someone looking down their phone while they're giant metal machines hurling 60 miles an hour. I'm like, you know, 60 miles an hour, you can cover a lot of God damn distance and a couple of seconds. And if you know anything about accidents, that's how shit happens. It happens like on a side. Boom. I was, I was, uh, I was, yeah, last accident I heard I was drunk. I was texting trying to get to the commerce where before last call without my glasses launch without your glass at some some, some cab stopped and you don't expect stop no reason. But they're hard. You hit him. I saw it last second stuffed into off, it's still smashed him and then so when a cop pulled over and was like, and I was trying to get him to wave off like no, we're good, we got this covered right.

Speaker 5:          02:14:56       But it was like completely because I looked away from the road to cop waved off, I waved off the cop like he was flown down to like, do you guys need any help? But like you know, I give him a sign up. Like we're handling this like adults, we're just exchanging insurance, hammered, panicking, sweating, heart, beating your chest. Also wondering, am I get back to the store, am I going to call it a breathalyzer sound and be able to get my set. That's what happens when you drink a drug, but texting and driving, super similar. You just look away from the road. I real. I done it a few times here and there, but I do it all the time. You learned your lesson and you've never done it since this accident, right? Drink and drive. Yes. I love to stay in hope show. I don't know if it was before or after and that was that one.

Speaker 5:          02:15:34       I think that might've been the last one because nothing happened to that one. I was beyond lit up. I couldn't stay to the end real needed to get Eric's rove home. I drove home and I kept telling myself that if I get to the store, I only live a few blocks away from the store. If I get there, I'll just pull over there and I'm like, what are you talking about? Does it make any sense? Yeah, you're blocked. It's 95% that's 99% of the way there. Dude. Why did you drive that? I was drunk and I could not make the right decision. I made the wrong decision and luckily nothing happened. Ooh. Well, how hard was it to stay in the lanes? I think a concentrated hard, I managed to do it but I shouldn't. I, it wasn't like I'm jumping, jumping forward. Like I think I can handle this, but like almost everybody has, but this was not one of those times. That's scary dude. I hate hearing that. Everybody out there learn from Ari. Don't do that shit. That's a terrible thing. Yeah. Scary. It was control your body man. You'll have less control and you want to feel like you have control but you don't and you drive in a giant death machine. Giant. That's what it is. Everyone does it. Everyone drives a little drunk. But it's like, you know, you put that everyone

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       does it, man. I saw a lot of it, but it's um, it's, it's certainly a fucking problem. I remember in high school though, I used to have like a note, like one drink and I'm done rule. I don't know if you guys had that with that one right way. No, I have had those, especially if I'm driving, if I'm doing a show that really can have a beer, maybe, maybe two beers on stage, but if I know I got to drive afterwards, it's the worst feeling in the world and you've got to sober up. But Sam Kinison said it the best. Well, you can't leave your car there. How are you gonna get your car home like that? Something like that. Toad. Yeah. That's not realistic for most people know. Most people. It's not Vancouver [inaudible] of all Canada. Vancouver, at least they have super strict laws so people just don't do it.

Speaker 4:          02:17:07       Yeah. I think that's one of the great things about living in New York city that everybody's just hiring cabs, captain, subway, cab, subway. You don't have to be responsible for being hammered. Yeah. But then you have to live in New York City, which I don't think I'm willing to do. We've got to be there. We're going to be a in New York in May. Right. When is it Brian? [inaudible] fourth. May 4th. Yeah. Um, but the big the most, oh, this weekend where the comedy magic club too. Are you going to do it? Maybe it just do Friday. Okay. What night you want to do Friday night? Yeah. Which show bull shows look, that's how quick we roll. There's a gentleman, that's what we make decisions. And Saturday a little Esther doesn't know yet, but I'm gonna ask her to do it with a me and a docket. So you're going to do just Friday?

Speaker 4:          02:17:52       Yeah. A little Lester in Dunkin fry. So Ari and and, and Dunkin on Friday and little Esther if she wants to do it. And Dunkin on Saturday this weekend. Comedy Magic Club. But the big one had saw for 20 in Atlanta. That's my fucking special. I'm taping it. This is the best shit I've ever had. This is, I could have taped a special a year ago. You were ready a long time ago. I'm fucked. I've never been this black. I've got like, I did an hour and 40 minutes the other night and it was just all material really just all look. Yeah, I got a lot of shit. I went, I went through all of it and I don't think I still, I still don't think I did everything. I still have some other stuff that I have to, that I've written down that I liked sort of abandoned along the way.

Speaker 4:          02:18:30       And I have to figure out where to put certain things I want to try to get to. It's like if he didn't get back to it, it's like, okay, I didn't, I'll, maybe I'll just start from here. From, you know, for the next tier. Yeah. Yeah. Like this never got good. Yeah. There's some bits. Well, there's some bits I can't keep doing. It was just done with, I'm sick of it, right? Yeah. I got to get rid of him. Even if I don't, they don't make it to the special. I'm getting rid of them, but just holding you back creatively after a certain amount of time there. So April 20th at the Tabernacle. Say It, Brian Tabernac bowl habitat. I have to tell [inaudible] how about, how about angle in Atlanta? So, uh, she moved up three dates, Vancouver 29th through the 31st the comedy mix. Ooh, one of the best clubs in the world. Yeah.

Yeah, we did once a long, long time. Yeah. It's a great spot. It's a perfect size to like the area of downtown, wherever it goes out. It's like two blocks away to a perfect sized club. A place is amazing.

Speaker 5:          02:20:11       Yeah. And then I think I'm doing an album. I think I got to try this again to take that thing. So the first one didn't work out? No, they just didn't get there in time. They just fucked up the recording too much. I didn't want to do it wrong. What'd they do? They missed the first three days. Why? They just didn't come. Why not? They weren't, they weren't organized. So they were supposed to be there. They never got there. Yeah. Well who is this? I don't know if I should say or not say, but it was just delicious. No, they were like, you wanna do it again. I'm like, I think I'm going to go and do it on my own. I don't want to try this again. What? That was really frustrating. They weren't there Wednesday weren't the Thursday. Oh, and you're killing. Yeah. And Thursday was a super like conservative crowd and Edmonton. But they, they laughed super hard. It all the cleaner jokes. Right. And I was like, that's the best reaction. That was clean jokes I've ever gotten. Right. Like I would have liked to have had that down. And then Friday they sent somebody down, but he's the system. And then Saturday there was all this feedback from the soda machine.

Speaker 2:          02:21:01       Oh No, they just couldn't use two full bits. And I was like, I want the hum. Yeah. That shit's annoying. It's hard to fucking get, get a, a special down. There's a lot of pressure to just have that moment be just like a real show. Yeah. So that's why I'm doing a lot of shows between now and then. If you see me like adding shows, that's exactly what's going on. That's trying to get ready. Yeah. That's why I'm doing, that's why I'm dealing, uh, Hollywood of doing the Improv. April 13th, 14th and 15th, the Hollywood Calif, not California rather, um, Hollywood, Lauren, Laura, Florida. The uh, the one at the hard rock. So that's a April 13th, 14th, and then the 20th Atlantic. Oh, in Louisiana we're doing, um, the Improv in, uh, in Louisiana and Louisiana Improv in Louisville, Kentucky. Say Louisiana. Jesus Christ who don't have the living talk tab or an ten one ml 33 30, uh, March 30th through April 1st we're at the Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky Improv, Ken and get like right and groove. I'm just trying to get, I'm just, I'm getting up like crazy. I'm just going to get up every weekend, all week, everywhere. There's kind of just banging out and listening to sets, doing a lot of writing too. And I'm, I'm also preparing for the next stuff, so I'm sandwiching in new bits and I find that when I do that I make my older bits better anyway. I'm just, it makes my whole set better when I'm new shit and had

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       a friend ask him about this. It goes sometimes like store. He was like, sometimes I feel like if I do this whole bits I make them longer and like add stuff to them. Yeah. But my, my theory with that is you would that new stuff, that new creative stuff that you put into that you would put into the other new bit. Yeah. Can you just make your other bits better? It is both. I think did a bit, can cook for a certain amount of time. Then after a while it's done. It's done. Sometimes it's not done and you'll like a year into this bit, you know, like you, but then in the next year you'll come up with all this great new shit to go along with it and now it becomes like a real piece that you're proud of it. Then you can let it go. It's all, I'm like knowing when to let it go.

Speaker 4:          02:22:59       You know? It's hard. Yeah. Friday I'll be at the ice house, but Joey Diaz and Doug Benson for the ice house chronicles. Yeah. Bridges in the icehouse chronicles by the way, are available only on iTunes under the desk squad label. Um, it's all free and everything. And it's desk squad. Dot. tv.tv.
