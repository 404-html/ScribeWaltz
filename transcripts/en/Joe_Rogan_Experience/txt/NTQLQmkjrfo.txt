Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches left a fucking hole. Just ate through his leg. Fair to Lance. What? When it was snakes bite you, that happens to you. You have to sky got bit in the foot by fair to Lance, which means, which by the way I believe means sort of fire fell. Denounce his French fell announced that don't show sounds fell donelle so sat both fell. By the way, Brian Cowen did several characters over the time. One of the reasons why I love going on these trips at Brian is because it becomes a giant five day comedy comes the bride couch. I'll do this my, it's a captive audience. You're not going anywhere. You're going to go. But it's also your style of humor. It's like that's what you do. Like when there's a group of guys around all of a sudden, I mean you would think that you would get tired of gay jokes after five days.

Speaker 1:          00:47          No, because he's got a bunch of different gay characters in the Russian who makes you eat salad for many days for reflux. You in the ass. Cause he wants your asshole clean. I have clean asshole. You have to, we have to keep it clean, clean. Either just sell it. I smack you this video of him explaining to Steve Rinella what he wants Reno's diet to be like. Dodi's thinking about putting it online like somehow or another. Figuring out do it online, do it an unnamed way. It's mostly because I have you as an audience and you're one of the best laughers. I just realized that after known you for 20 years. I was like, you know what? I think he might be one of the greatest laughers cause you, you cackle you literally, when you're laughing you literally go, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

Speaker 1:          01:34          How funny. I, it's seductive to me. I'm literally, and then those guys or those guys are such good audiences too. Quintessential rock star with a different spectrum than, you know, maybe not. Not too, I don't know. You're being drug induced delirium and going through the, you know, I think those dudes at that time had, had probably been through enough to say, I've seen, I've been to the limit. You know, I've seen the edge of the cliff debt. But that's the old adage like if you suck enough, uh, Dick's, one day you're going to want to have sex with a woman. Like if a gay guy gets to some breaking point, hundred million Dickson his ass and mouth, he's like enough blizzard of Dick Knopf, please take it wasn't a woman. Well it doesn't happen, but does it happen the other way where a man, a straight man has so many different female partners at one day he knew, okay, they fucked.

Speaker 1:          02:32          I want to be the guy that says, I want to be the guy that says it a little spoon. If you're lying on someone's shoulder and they put their arm around like that, what you do is you reach up at the left arm, you protect the neck. Very important is that something like this? You want to do it like this? You want to cop it and don't let go of that wrist, pin it down to your chest. Dead. You gotta you got shrimp out. I know you guys know about Hashtag Hashtag trump out. Oh man, everybody, it's so great. So great at the show. Sometimes people will just be like bad shit. It's like, yeah. So funny.

Speaker 1:          03:11          What a beautiful part of our history here. Joe Lou Reed. Wasn't that Lou Reed? David Bowie's God net worths Steve Gutenberg. David Bowie's Goddamn free lunch. You know there was some study recently about uh rehydrating and they were talking about like how much more people rehydrate if they're around things that taste good. Like if you have like sugary drinks, like gatorade type drink, like how much more you'll drink than if it's just water, right? Yeah, we're just gross. We're gross. Slovenly and sugars, like those simple sugars, like those are really not good for you mean you didn't get away with eating them after you work out because your body is sorta glucose craving, but the reality of those kinds of sports drinks and stuff like that, it's like this, then I'll fucking healthy for you at all. This are corn syrup when liquid. Yeah, motherfuckers. Well I think most of the sports drinks or are owned by companies that produce soft drinks.

Speaker 1:          04:11          Yeah, I'm sure a lot of them are for sure. A lot of them are for sure. But they say the chocolate milk is the best thing to drink right after your workout. Is that true? I guess it depends who you talk to. You and I, I think this is based on some studies that they've done, but if you talk to anyone that's in the Chinese medicine or like my wife's really into Ayurvedic Medicine, milk is the demon. It's like, what do they say? They see it's drinking plus and then oak is drinking pus. How's it drinking? Pus, they hate milk. Who are these people? Well, anybody. Have they ever eaten cookies because milk without cookies. It's just bullshit. Cookies without milk. Crowded. Yeah. There's a, there's a lot of people into this method of eating and you know, eating for your body type and everything. And anyone that's a, there's three things in Chinese medicine that caused a lot of phlegm.

Speaker 1:          05:02          And in Chinese medicine, phlegm is not only what you hack up when you're exercising, but also, uh, energy blockages in the system. So the top of the list is dairy. Uh, second is peanuts. In third or bananas, you can't eat peanuts. And you can't eat bananas. No. What kind of communist bullshit is this? What are they trying to say? Huh? Bananas. I know what the Fuck is wrong with bananas, man. I don't know if I buy this Chinese medicine shelf and I live the people that brought you rhino horns for hard ons. Isn't that the same folk it is? Uh, yeah. They do all sorts of crazy stuff. How about tiger bone make you strong? No, it won't just kills fucking tiger. Tom Ass. Yeah. So I take all this stuff with a grain of salt. You think back at some of the misconceptions you had in your youth about sex, and it really is hilarious.

Speaker 1:          05:51          I was under the impression that you needed what was called at the time a scumbag, which was a condom. A rubber. These are called that. It was a condom. That's where a scumbag comes from. It was called a, yeah. A condom was a scumbag back in the old days. Wow. And this was when I was a kid. So I had never used that term. But I heard my parents say that my dad's friends, you know? Yeah. I didn't have a scumbag last night, so shit like that. I know. It's hilarious. So I thought you needed one to get a girl pregnant. I thought the shit that was on it got the girl pregnant. Yeah. Yeah. And uh, and I thought you had a fucker in the ass. Like I didn't know that there was a vagina. I just thought, you know, is an ass you've so you fucker in the ass.

Speaker 1:          06:35          Why with a condom and she has a kid, why you off? But the fucked up thing is now I fucked girls don't want to have a kid so I don't wear a condom and I fucked him on the policy. So it did have some kind of an influence on my future when I was in high school, and I don't remember where I learned this or if it was taught in class, but I specifically remember something where it was, it was like a real source where they were saying that in order for a woman to get pregnant that she has to have an orgasm. Because when a woman has an orgasm, it opens up the canal and the eggs get through. I remember like there's been some just ridiculously ignorant shit that I was taught. Yeah, that is, I, I would, I would think may because of the moisture, you know, it gives a little more fluid for the sperm cells to swim up, but it was like a door was only good at anyway, like tall planing it, like a door was opening. There's like 1980s healthcare shit. I Dunno if they didn't know back then or they just, it was an older even textbook where they were just ridiculous. That sounds like something you'd tell a girl, like, so you could come in there, look, I won't give you an Oregon. You'll be fine. As long as they don't make you calm when I'm making any payments. And then after I come, I'll make you come.

Speaker 1:          07:54          Nothing better than that.
