Speaker 1:          00:00:00       [inaudible] were fucking live. I was just about to take a sip of coffee, but this shit is way more important. We're here with Jim Florentine, hilarious, standup comedian and Trans Racial Pioneer. You were doing that. You were pushing the Trans Racial movement like about two or three decades ago, right? I was, you know, and um, you know, it was living with Jim Norton is, I've seen a lot. That video, there's a video of you guys. Was it you two living together where you had the fucking black mold? Oh my God. When you move the picture and you see the mold of the wall, people fucking die from that shit. Like the amount of mold you guys had. I know. I had it in my bedroom and I would just, I put tinfoil on the walls to cover it around by the bed. It was all the way up coming up, crawling up the walls.

Speaker 1:          00:00:41       I just put tinfoil on mine. It should be fine. It's so fucking crazy. Who made that video? It was somebody from Oni show came over and did the cribs. God. He like, people get really sick from that shit. Right. I know. I don't know. Understand how we didn't get sick cause we had it for like a year. We're paying $800 for three for three bedroom right outside of New York City and the Jersey side and splitting it three ways. I had a girl if I'm living me at the time too, so we were paying like two 66 a month. Wow. That's pretty sweet. And we weren't making any money so we figured we'll move right next to New York City and here's the video it's going on behind you. Did you test it and see if he had anything from living there? Well fuck now Tom, like he's had a evacuated, his whole house Tom like is they had a terrace walls down.

Speaker 1:          00:01:27       They, they have to like, I guess they treat the mold to kill it. They got a tear all your walls down and they get to do these like tests of the air to make sure there's not spores that are flying around in the air. I mean it's a real infestation. It's fucked. I know we didn't, we didn't even do like a mold. We didn't even look it up to find out if it was toxic. It's a, I'm pretty sure it's not good. Like this is sick. It's like it's dripping down the side of this painting now. They moved this painting. It was, we went to a garage sale around the corner to buy more paintings just to cover up the mold that's got can now. Oh, it's super bad for you. That's absolutely soup. You know what? My Damn Marino Jersey and hang it up, but you got to think that just the sheer air that's in that room, that'd be filled with spores and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       Right. I think that's very, very poisoned. It's like you probably have some kind of fucked up shit from that. No, I bet he's fine now. You don't, but I bet back then you're probably suffering from just a lot of stress on your lungs. What am I a doctor? Was Your Voice Really High Pitch? Was it like, know he's been like this? Yeah, it's always had the voice that didn't work, but when you're fucking young and poor and you're a comic, that is the way to go to 66 a month. Huh? The lower your bills are like for comics it's like the whole thing in the beginning is you got to get through the spot where you don't make any money, figure out how to do it and then it start making money. Start getting road gigs and start. But area where you just like, it's so important to fucking save as much money as possible.

Speaker 1:          00:03:04       Yeah, we were, we were living like an hour south of the city in Jersey. Me and no art and then we figured we needed to get close because we've gone in there like four or five nights a week trying to get into clubs. I moved in with it. I didn't even like this girl. I just wanted to pay a third at a rent. I really didn't even like her that much. I'm like, look, we can cut this in threes. That's hilarious. Look at Jim off fresh faced like cause I will add like a little boy. Oh your bathroom g suite. Merciful Christ. I had a shit hole of an apartment in new Rochelle. Ooh. It's actually could have been a lot worse. This is like just mostly families and shit in the neighborhood, but that was the same thing as the cheapest place that I could get that had a place to park cause I had to do a lot of road gigs.

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       I, I did city gigs like in in New York City, but at a certain point in time I was like, fuck man, he sits are only like 10 15 minutes long. You've got to travel all over to do them and they don't pay any money. I could just go to Connecticut and make 150 bucks tonight. You know, I could go to long island and make 150 bucks. I think that's real money. I think that's when I first met you is Bob Levy and his wife had all these like eggs, these one nighters that pay like 150 bucks, 200 his wife was hot. God Good Lord was insane. She was one of those like what happened there? Relationships. First of all, Bob is hilarious. Chicks love like, he's so funny. Like if you ever hung around with Bob Levy, do you know Bob Leave? You know, haven't hung out with this fucking hilarious.

Speaker 1:          00:04:25       That dude's hilarious. He was at a, I watched um, uh, Artie Lange headline in Vegas ones at the Luxor is me and Joey and Eddie Bravo went cause we were there for the UFC and um, he went up and he was doing some shit where he was having girls eat his asshole. They put blue cheese on his ass and he was describing why he couldn't do that anymore because of lawsuits or whatever. But he would put blue cheese and girls asses and eat it on stage right on stage right out of her ass. Wouldn't do it. But I don't know. He was a famous comedian. I mean Bob believe he's like a nationally known comedian and he's doing these girls from the audience, from the audit guys. White guy would go with his wife, go up there, come on and let him eat blue cheese out of your ass.

Speaker 1:          00:05:12       What's the big deal? I'm like, it's so crazy. It's so crazy, but he's just a funny fuck. Like people were heckling him and he was just torturing them. Bob's been around forever. He's, he's an old pace. One of the best night club comics out there. Oh, pro old pills. Every time knows how to do it. He's just a funny guys just been around and he's a good dude too. But God damn did he have a hot wife? I'll believe them. She still hot. I should came to my Cheryl. I'm sure she hears still hot. Crushing. It was insane how hot she was. Like Bob, there's no, you don't deserve that. Has that happened in California? Would kind of make sense if Bob was on a sitcom. If I was on a Sitcom and she lived in California, like girls like her I think are more common in California, but in Jersey she fucking Christ like they didn't even have the name of a number for that. She wasn't even a 10 he had to like,

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       you gotta go like, it's like a 10 plus executive class 10 and she hung in there for like three years and then she just couldn't take it out. They were booking gigs. I did a bunch of their gigs. Yeah. That's when I originally met Yo. Cause he'd do a bunch of one night or such a good dude. Yeah. Always been a good dude. Funny, crazy fuck would. Yeah, he would. But, and you don't want, he's had, he had to stop being blue cheese at a girl's acids can because he was going through a divorce and his ex wife, the second wife, the lawyers will use in the footage on youtube against him in court to tell the audience, look, I gotta stop eating blue jeans. And they would bow. He goes, look, their shits on Youtube. I'm trying to get custody of my son. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          00:06:39       It's just like specific dressing. What about thousand dollars? No blue cheese and nothing like book. This girl is there. He puts blue cheese on her ass and he eats it onstage. What a lucky guy. Oh, he's a savage and he holds on to, he doesn't let go. Let go. Hold on. I know they're trying to run away and he's, he's a fucking savage. He's a savage. He's the get that girl's ass hoe. Jesus Christ. Wow. Blue Cheese in Wildwood. I mean it's kind of like a cultural legend thing. You know? Like when, when I, by the way, when I first heard that he was doing, it wasn't even remotely remotely surprised. I was like, oh, Bob believes he's doing that all right. Yeah, it's fucking crazy. They'd tell it like if somebody told me that Greg Fitzsimmons started eating blue cheese at a girl's acids, I'd be like, Whoa, what the fuck happened at Greg Greg One south.

Speaker 2:          00:07:28       He went crazy. Briggs gone crazy. But when, when I heard it was Bob Levy, it was like totally acceptable. Like if you know him, like something like that's click completely acceptable. Like, Oh yeah, that's probably what he does. I'm the first time he did it, we would just get got cancels who were just hanging out like holiday inn in the, in the room where the comedy is supposed to be in some, some girl was there and we were drinking with her and we somehow we got her to go, hey, we'll get, we'll get mushed it up like $37 if he can eat blue cheese out of your ass, cause wheat and wings. And Bob said, I want to just blue cheese out of your ass. And I go, how much would you do it? She goes, I don't know what, I've got 37 she goes, okay fine. And he blokes are just in front of like four people and maybe he's like, I got to close with that. I got it right. I go, got worked at, please join US friends. I don't know if that's going to work on stage. Oh my God. I kind of, well kind of a fucking animal.

Speaker 2:          00:08:20       What kind of fucking animal offers? He drilled $37 to eat blue cheese that her ass. And then after he's, as it says, I got to close with that. Oh my God, I'm fucking crying. Those are the beautiful people that you meet in standup comedy. You know, this is the only meet those people in stand up comedy. You just don't, they don't exist in other professions or like extreme Elvis. I've met that guy. If he this crazy, his show was amazing. I don't think he does that anymore. Yeah, I don't think he does. It was a fucking amazing show. Extreme Elvis is, this guy's an Elvis impersonator

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       and he takes his clothes off and he pisses in this girl's mouth. It's like, it's fucking crazy. He gets totally naked. Yeah. And they're really good musicians. Like Penn Jillette to pendula tell them about me, but I don't know who told who about doubt. But he and I talked and he wound up hiring the guy to do like a party at his house and pens like strict and like no drugs, no this, no that. So you had to do it sober cause extreme Elvis would do all shows completely fucked up. Like drink a gallon of fucking whiskey on states. That's him right there. Holy Shit. Yeah Dude. I mean you ain't seen nothing yet. There was, I wrote a whole blog about it. I wrote a whole blog about it a long time ago. Like way back in 2003 because he was amazing. This show was amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:09:41       He Ha, he goes, who owns showing through change purse? This girl, the girl next to him goes, hi, do I do, he just pisses in her mouth. She's lying there. She's topless. She's hot by the way. And she's talented and she can play, you know, I forget what, what she did, whether she sang or she played guitar, I forget when instrument, but I remember overall was a very good shot. They're very talented on top of the fact it was insane. You'd be pissing in this girl's mouth and some guy like in from the audience, like someone or was a girl. Some girl tried to stick like a beer bottle up his ass cause he gets cut totally naked. So some girl comes up behind him and it started sticking this beer bottle up his ass and he grabs her hand and starts putting it the right in the right hole and then she panics and she runs away.

Speaker 3:          00:10:29       Like he was helping her shoved this beer bottle up his ass. Holy. You don't want to do that. It's just like fuck this and the girl just leaves. But it is, it was a fucking crazy show. Just see what Jamie just put up. It was a pool cue. Uh, I'm not surprised, but I'm also not surprised that he doesn't do it anymore. If he was doing these kinds of things on a regular basis because that's fucking dangerous or your asshole. You can't just have random strangers stick stuff up your ass. They won't be so kind. Yeah. That sounds like GG Allen. What did you just, she would just take a shit on stage is just throwing up the audience before it. If the first song, I'm telling you though, this dude is really good. Like as a musician, he was really fucking good. That's it. That was the craziest thing about the show.

Speaker 3:          00:11:12       It was not just that it was this freak show. He's doing the freak show thing, but he's a fucking talented musician. Like he does a wicked Elvis, like he's doing suspicious minds and the whole audience was singing along. We're caught in a trap to that, to the two. I can't walk out well like the whole crowd was going because I love you too. And these guys get, he's got his dick out. He's fucking naked on stage is pissed and a girl's mouth and they're singing suspicious minds. I mean it's a fucking show, not a girl that he pissed at her mouth as she ended a band and she's good. I forget what she did. Fuck, I wish I could remember, cause it was like 12 years ago. We saw it in like 2003

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       so every night he would piss in her mouth. I don't know how many times they did shows, but I talked to him briefly. He was telling him, telling me all these different times he's been arrested at all different times. They wouldn't give his money because a lot of times the clubs, they don't know what the fuck he's going to do. And then also this guy's getting tick out. He's pissing girl's mouths and shit. I don't think they understand the show. I just really don't think they understand what they're signing up for. So these like rock venues would have him come in there and then they get fucking mad. I don't even want to beat him up. I'm didn't hire him at the end of the night. Shit, I gotta find out this guy's still around. I want to see the show. I hope. I hope he is. I hope, but I hope he takes better care of himself.

Speaker 4:          00:12:33       Like you can't, you can't just drink a bottle of whiskey every night and do this. It's just I can't, I don't, can't imagine how he could do this show all the time. This is a fucking super dangerous show for your body. He's got a bunch of chickens picking. He's lying down. They're tied up and they put green all over his cock and he's got a bunch of chickens that they put on top of the sheet and they're pecking at the grain. It's right over his dick. This is so fucking bizarre. Is that guy over there? Exactly. Exactly. Who's that guy? Oh Shit. He's out of his mind. It's like Ari Schick fear. Last time I saw him it was a, I was going into the um, Paul Provenza greenroom showed you ever do that show? No. I know we talked about but didn't get a chance to ask him what or not he's doing it again.

Speaker 4:          00:13:18       Fuck that guy was good though. Here's at the comedy store. I probably like two years ago, any of him singing because what's that? We'll see if you can find one word. There's actual singing because the crazy thing is that he's really fucking really talented. It was a great show though. It was very few shows where you go, fuck yeah, absolutely. Out of there and you go, I just guess I saw the king pissing this chick's mouth and then have the whole audience singing along to a song. It was awesome. That's great. Is there anything like that right now that's, that's big. That's, it's hard to do something like that. It's could because you know this was 2003 so the Internet was around. It wasn't around like as around now it's not the same thing. Like you would go to jail. You're not allowed to do that.

Speaker 4:          00:14:00       You can't just pull your dick out and insurance and everything. Yeah. Everything. Yeah. No one's going to take a chance anymore. By the way. What the fuck is wrong with the world where a guy can't piss in the girl's mouth on stage like that? You can't prove to me that the sound art because it is art. Okay. If you can make a show that's that fucked up. You got a guy who's Elvis. He's, he sings really good. He's kind of fucking talented band with them. Oh, one of his band members, she takes off her clothes, her tits, her out, and he pisses in her mouth and it's Dick's about that pig. It's the whole thing is ridiculous because it is a goddamn ridiculous show. And the piston in her mouth make the show better, like as an artistic piece. Absolutely. For real because it was just more surreal and more fucked up. But how is that an illegal Goddamn Communists, Jim Florentine? I don't understand that. Hey, he'd have to do like backyard shows

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       that this point. This

Speaker 5:          00:14:59       what year is this? 2010 is that what it's headed? Well, there was a lot of this at the shows too. A lot of fucking screaming and people couldn't believe.

Speaker 6:          00:15:19       What is he doing? I used to have an extreme Elvis tee shirt.

Speaker 5:          00:15:43       I think I lost it somewhere. I think I left it in a hotel room somewhere. Hate fucker. Hate that. Ex girlfriends taking your shirts. Tell rooms because Elvis baby thickness. He's doing that song. Black Sabbath by black Sabbath. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:16:06       Elvis don't Jose. It's beautiful. Think I think

Speaker 2:          00:16:11       the folks at home get the point, but go check him out if he's still there. I kind of around any mortar lead singer died about a year ago. They're going to great stage show. Was it like that? Just shoot. She is on the crowd and stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. There was a lot of special effects, like things coming out of chest and stuff. There was a girl in the band. She gave birth to a baby and the baby came out and they put it right in the wood chipper and the blog on all over the audience. I was like 23 years old. I'm like to stick right as thing that I've ever seen in my life. I wish. That's one thing I wish I got to see. I never got to see a guar concert. Oh my God. They threw a fake baby, came right out of our gate.

Speaker 2:          00:16:49       I think you're still doing shows with all the members and stuff, but gray band always, always went to see it. I'm like, oh my God. How did, how did they not go to jail for that? How did they not get like there was some protest, some family advocacy group or anything? I mean, I would think that someone would protest. You put a fake baby in a woods shepherd as a part of your act. They would do it, whatever president. They would cut his head off. That was whoever was president at the time. They cut his head off on stage. You can still do that though. Kenyon. Yeah, they still do. It was to just do it with doing it up. I saw him two years ago. They were doing with Obama. Just head off. Yeah. Jesus Christ. I would think that the secret service who come get you if you did some shit like that. Yeah. That's why I like rules. I thought you weren't even allowed to say like, I want to kill the president. He didn't let me finish. I've John the juice. You're never something like that is why I would always say something at the end. Why not what George Bush did it for Bush circuit city. Look at this. Look at the outfit. This fucking guy's got on. Does he have a fake? Is that what I saw?

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       Got a giant fake ticket. I'm going to fuck them. It's a fist. Oh, what is his dick? What does, oh my God, yes. In the plugs in the courts right now. Right off. And it squirts in the crowd. Oh my God, this is so ridiculous. It's kind of like for something for kids when you go to like Disneyland or Universal Studios, like one of those shows, but for adults, do you think they know about this? Oh, you showed a deal cause they were doing President Bush when he was in office. So whoever, whatever president is. So she seems like you could go to jail for this, doesn't it? It kind of falls into cheesy horror movie kind of category. I'll blow for sure. But I mean it brings up, it brings up an interesting conversation about, um, making fun of things and what you shouldn't, shouldn't be able to make fun of.

Speaker 4:          00:18:37       Cause that Charlie Hebdo thing that happened, you know, that's uh, you, you know, you don't know what that is in France, the people that ran this magazine has this magazine that did a lot of satire drawings of Muhammad and, and these dudes showed up, um, and, and fucking gun them all down. Killed everybody. Right? And they killed the dude's. They had a man hunt for him and he's to a radical Muslim dudes. But um, that was just, you know, drawing, drawing pictures, which everybody's like, oh, well that's fucked up. You can't do that. You just can't do, you can't kill people for drawn a picture. But we do have certain things you're not allowed to do. Like you, you literally can't say, I want to kill Mr President. You can't say that. He couldn't say his name if you said that, if you said, I want to, I want to kill that guy, I want to kill the president.

Speaker 4:          00:19:26       Like that's illegal, like you think would literally lock you up for that. Which is weird because he's like, you know, that's a kind of a figure of speech. You know, like people say that all the time, oh, I want to kill that guy. Fucking hate him. I mean like you, you like if there's a guy in a movie that sucks like these, like you don't like him as an actor, you might say, oh, I want to kill that fucking guy. You don't mean it. Right. But is that illegal? Like if you say that like the president has some stupid thing that he vetoes or something that people don't agree with. If you said that it's a common figure of speech was you said that and he did it publicly, they can fucking take you in. You had a secret service at your house the next day. Ted Nugent said something a couple of years ago about Obama, not say I want to kill him, but he said something, I forget what the quote was in the secret service was at his house the next day.

Speaker 4:          00:20:12       I think he was saying something to the like, he's just like, if Obama gets arrested, he might wind up in jail. Yeah, we're all gonna be dead and in jail or something like that. So it wasn't even a direct, not the president. I think he was saying that like he might wind up in jail, that Nugent might wind up in jail. Something like that crying, you know, it could be seen as implying that he would do something cause he, but it's weird, you know to do, I'm just going to kill the president and stop, you know he's doing a hunting show, likes playing guitar. It's not going to kill the president. And then Ted Horse, he's like with the secret service can, they are fans of mine. And I put like little concert with, I gave him all my, my latest CD is that I was going to take him out back and the shooting range, but they didn't want to do it.

Speaker 4:          00:20:54       Have you ever seen him in the helicopters shooting pigs? No. You gotta see it. You gotta see it. It's one of the greatest things the world has ever known. Ted Nugent in a helicopter shooting wild pigs with a machine gun just tucked on punk picked up on, it's the fucking craziest thing flying around in Texas in a fucking helicopter. Him and his dude, they call him pig man. So pig man and Ted Nugent and they're circling around these giant packs of pigs and just lighten them up. It's fucked up. And was he it? Yeah, he'll play it. I love new. Is this it? This is just talking about the devastation. There's like a whole graphic before the video that shows this Devin what these wild pigs do in Texas because they are absolutely devastating to the farms down there. They're not out of control. There's so many of them, millions of wild pigs in Texas alone. I mean it's a fucking infestation. But like as you see when you're circling over in the helicopter, you're talking about a huge area. I mean Texas has goddamn an enormous and these things are impossible to eradicate cause they're smart. So once they get together and they're fucking shooting these things out of helicopters and it's fucking madness. You can shoot as many as you want all day long and you shoot them at night. There's no rules. You just shoot him. I mean it's like, look at this. This is crazy. Awful. It's awful.

Speaker 4:          00:22:19       Well wouldn't be awful if you were hungry and you wanted a pig or if it was your farm. The problem is if it's your farm, like fuck man, like what is a farm? Then, you know, I, if they become a threat to people, that's one thing, but it is really weird that you could just, just because their cost, they cost money. Like they're chewing up people's food, but their animals, you know, like that's what they kind of do. Yeah. It's like they have to manage them, but you have to figure out a way to manage the population. But it seems like they can't, it seems like there's just too many of them. They just have to kill him. But doing it that way just seems kind of fucked. It's like, it seems that we can put him to sleep in [inaudible] bed or something. Like make it to the latest thing where we bless these pigs instead of shooting them with a machine gun out of a helicopter. It's just, you know, no, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:23:17       I mean look at cats and dogs. Like we, we put cats and dogs to sleep or we try to do something for them, but like, like animals that we need to get over that we're overpopulated with, you know, we shouldn't be really allowed to heal. Just like, I don't know, torture or shoot with machine gun out of a helicopter. I think they're just doing it because it's one of the only ways it's effective I think on the ground. You can't get to them. Doing it from a helicopter is like one of the best ways to do it because they're too smart. If you're on the ground, you try to get near him. They run away, they smelled

Speaker 3:          00:23:45       things, they hear things they don't see very good, but they can hear very well and they smell anything. They just bolt. What about poisoning? It can poison them cause then you poison a bunch of other shit too and you poison the environment and you poisoned the things that eat the things he poisoned. If you poison a pig and the pig gets eaten by a mountain lion, a mountain lion gets poisoned too. And the mountain lion could dive from the same disease or the same um, poison that you can't have that pig meat. Either pygmy goes bad. They just kind of figured out a way to keep them from, you know, that's one of the best ways it's fucked up. But it's one of the best ways to kill him. So those helicopter things, cause they could do it and they can get a hundred of them, 200 of them in a day.

Speaker 3:          00:24:25       They got 450 in one day on that pig man show. Pigs are so smart though. It sucks. I don't like when smarter, you know, I hear you. It's fuck yeah, you're right. You're right. There's, they're smart. But there is such a big difference between smart animals and smart people. There's a giant fucking difference. And I wonder what the, the variable of like being wild is. Cause like pigs, if you're around pigs and they're, um, they're a domesticated, they're sweet. They're really sweet little animals to come over and hang with you. They're pretty cool but are domesticated. So it means their experiences, none of their experience has been devastating. They haven't seen their mother getting killed by a wild mountain lion or something like that. They haven't seen their brother getting eaten by a bear. You know, they're, they're not living in the wild, just running away from shit all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:25:14       Like a wild pig is they're constantly fed and taken care of so they have like, it's sorta like people, you know, people, if you leave people in a wild state, like people, even to this day, there's places in the world where people live a far scarier life than we could ever imagine. Like every day you're dealing with violence and chaos and danger. Those people are, there couldn't be a wilder style of human being. Then we are, you know, and I think that's what's going on with these pigs. It's like it's kind of fucked that you can eat something that also, if the circumstances were better, it could be your buddy kind of had on that pig and it would be awesome. Yeah. Years, there's, there's definitely something to that because it's all about their, their experiences. If they're growing up in a cage and you just, I mean, we don't even understand their behavior because the behavior that we have of pigs is almost all of it is behavior of things that are locked up.

Speaker 3:          00:26:11       You know, the, the actual wild behavior of him, they're super hard to watch. You've got to, it's hard to get close to them. You know if tried tagging them and releasing them and all that a fucking nightmare. They're clever fuckers. It's almost like it could take a shitload of pigs and put it in some kind of like spinning like a windmill type things and that we can make them ahead make energy for us and instead or something like that. Right, like give him food in a giant hamster wheel and as they go and chase after the food. Yeah, but you have to make that food. It's like it takes energy to make the food that's going to give them energy. Like logically it wouldn't make sense

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       unless you have like a super good, very efficient system or like each spin was worth like hundreds of kilowatts and right. The windmill was like five miles long and it's just rows and rows of pigs to it. How much food would you have to give those fucks? You don't have to give him anything but be fake food and then they die, smelled good, cut them up and let them eat their food. I thought about this at all. They eat the row in front of them and they're done in by row each roads like a week, so they die in the ones in front of fuck, eat, shut the fuck up.

Speaker 4:          00:27:18       You know, they say that's one of the best, like that movie snatch that they'd say that really is one of the best ways to get rid of a body man. Some guy who was a pig farmer in, I think it was British Columbia was also a serial killer and he would throw the bodies into the pig sty and the pigs would just destroy them, eat everything. They eat, everything. It's shit out the teeth. That's about it. Everything else gets done. They chew through the bones, everything. Wow. Yeah, they're monsters. It's crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:27:43       This girl I met recently, she collects teeth and like all the teeth I know on the teeth, all the teeth have a story like this is my friend Jeff's tooth or this is the girl's tooth that I met on a subway or whatever, and she says she likes to throw them in her bed and sleep with it. The tea. So when she wakes up, but it looks like teeth marks all over her body. Let me open your mouth if you're missing any Christ. And uh, when do you guys getting married and yet you still got your wisdom teeth? Yeah, I know I got rid of, well, I've got it right. Yeah. Cause she'd be like, do some we got them out and write. There's always gonna be someone new out there that just surprises you even why thank you. Got It all figured out. She hot at least. Oh, she's super high. Uh, and she has all these other scholars. Like she has monkeys scores, cat scholars. Like her whole house has a skulls and then she has jars. It's so healthy. And one of the chief had like, it was like a fresh one. Like I had some meat on it or something. It's gross. A smile paid a dude on craigslist to pull it. Did she have two feet on his shoulders? Fucking pair of pliers.

Speaker 2:          00:28:48       Fucking periscope chicks are crazy screaming. You haven't hooked up with her? No, no, no. I'm not going to freak me out. Good for you. So how about this idea of standards?

Speaker 4:          00:28:57       Naacp lady from Spokane, Washington to pretended to be black.

Speaker 2:          00:29:03       This is not real life. This is like simulation theory and somebody hacked it. Just playing a joke on this. It's a fucking good question. Her parents out or apparently, did you look at her, look in her eye when the reporter goes, you could see where everything just,

Speaker 4:          00:29:21       yeah, in her eye she realized, oh no, I've been found there's a, um, a picture of a before and after with her and the, before it was when she was identifying as white, she's Trans Racial. When she was identifying as white, she had freckles and blonde hair and then all of a sudden she's got that Orange Tan

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       thing going on and like, like legit, like black woman permie looking hair. Like she got her hair permed, sexy. That waitress at the comedy store. You look at that, look at her hair. I mean, wow. That's, and she, she, you would teach, she taught at a university level African studies. Wow. How does no one know her from her past? That could be such a parent's coming out and saying that like this. Apparently, uh, her parents had adopted a bunch of brothers and sisters that were black, I think. Was that what it was? Four brothers and sisters that were black. And so somewhere along the line she appropriated like that they were her family and that she's black and she started calling them one of them. Our son. A little boy. Oh boy. Definitely hotter black though. Yeah. That's a new trend. She looks hot on the right, but that can't be her for real.

Speaker 3:          00:30:37       That's Photoshop shit going on. It's the whole thing is very, very strange. It's really strange. But here's what's even stranger apparently look at hair. Wonderful. Apparently the tea out of the founding people, like if it was 14 founding people of the NAACP, um, 10 of them were white. It was a lot of white people involved in the Naacp and baby, this is good about what happens here. I mean, not that this lady is crazy and she's pretending to be black, but maybe it's good that the conversation gets brought up and people realize that like racial equality movement. It doesn't have to be all black people and wasn't all black people, so if it was like there was in there like her race doesn't have anything to do with how good she is. They're like, she's really good at her job. She's like really into black people.

Speaker 3:          00:31:25       That's what it is. That's what it is. Nothing wrong with that. Some people are really into French history. Some people are, you know what I'm saying? She's like top wig. Wait, what's the new word? You can still say it's still say wigger. Okay. It hasn't been stolen it from us yet. They haven't robbed us of wigger. It's so weird. The whole thing is wonderful. It's wonderful. This lady's wonderful, but meanwhile apparently she was, she was good at her job and the Naacp, they were actually saying, yeah, she went full. You got cat yard on her head. She tried to figure it out like a bunch of different ways of doing it. That's when she was like, I'm going to get found if I keep dying my hair black and putting that fucking spray tan stuff is going to call me by my sheets. Orange. Hold up. The whole thing is so amazing. It's amazing. And she browses on fleek. She sued school. What? Naacp imposter sued school over race claims. Oh my God. She masqueraded as a black, as black, uh, once sued Howard University for denying her teaching posts and a scholarship because she was a white woman. The smoking gun is learned. Whoa. I'm older than her. Wow. She

Speaker 2:          00:32:47       graduated from the historically black college with a master's of fine arts degree. That's so interesting. So in 2002, she sued the school that is so interesting. And she was teaching somewhere else. Right? Was she teaching there where she teaches somewhere else, but she was teaching like African related courses. She's just really in the Africa. Imagine people. But let's put yourself in her shoes. I'm not saying the trans ratio is real.

Speaker 3:          00:33:15       Okay. I'm not saying you should be able to just identify with a different race, but if you could, she would be a really good argument for it. Right. Okay. She's got black people in her family that she loves dearly. Right. She maybe identifies with them. She went to an all black college. She was teaching African studies and she was running the fucking NAACP. I mean, if anybody can be trans racial, that lady was kicking ass at it. Absolutely right. You got to say, I'm fucking impressed with what she's done to her love of African people of black people has let her do an amazing job in several areas.

Speaker 2:          00:33:56       Right. I want to see your wider Facebook page looks like. How does a a boyfriend or somebody that she dated not come out and say something like, look, this chick is really, they might not know why. Really annoying. No, no, no, but you know what you mean. Put more makeup on and she just hides from you and the fucking curtain in her house is closed. Like drag. She keeps all the lights off. She kicks you out at night. I can't sleep at anybody. You got to go eat the greatest chick ever. I don't have to sleep at her. As soon as you leave, you hear the compressors have written machine. She's fucking spraying herself. The big airbrush can like she's fucking detailed a Chevelle.

Speaker 2:          00:34:35       She had to have gotten spray Tan thousand percent. There was a spray tan or somewhere that newer secret, you know they had to bring it over for the big umbrella. Yeah. Yeah. Well this is like, did they, don't they have a better way of doing that now? How do they do that? They still make you stand in and spray to make it realistic. That's the best way. I mean, you have the rub on kind of stuff like that, but you can't usually get it even enough unless you really, she just spent all day doing it. How weird are we? Not We, because I haven't done it. I don't think you're doing it. That people are going and getting fucking spray Tan. I mean that is so insane. You're going to end again. Die Sprayed all over. Your body stinks too, but just fucking weird. It's just weird and it wears off in like a day. You could get two days or whatever it is. Get the abs sprayed on it though. You can. Yeah. So retarded and people not have time to lay in the sun anymore. Our Toe. Maybe you live in Seattle? Yeah, there's no room. I just know from girls that you were like, oh, I have to have photo shoot tomorrow so I have to get spray Tan because I tan all day to day and just, you know, it's a timing thing.

Speaker 4:          00:35:40       Yeah, I get it. And it's also skin cancer thing. Some chicks don't want to get skin cancer. You know, standing out in the sun is not good for you apparently, which is fucked because you need the sun for Vitamin D, Vitamin D, You need vitamin a. The fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:35:55       I don't put sunscreen on. I'm out. I don't give a shit. You're an animal. Look at you. You don't give a fuck. You do it in spurts. A little little spots. You don't go out there for eight hours at a time. I used to landscape when they'll fucking shirt on. I just did it too. I can have a tan you a check.

Speaker 4:          00:36:10       That's what everybody did back then. Yeah. Nobody wore sunscreen when we were kids.

Speaker 2:          00:36:15       We put oil on and we did the opposite. We got that oil just can't, especially in like Massachusetts, you know your summers a week long and you've got to get it in while you can. Absolutely. I went up two notches on a scale of one to 10. If I had a tan, I went from like a four to a six. So I had like a three month window where I was a sex. I had to try to clean up. When you're young, especially, you've fucking making moves. You like to tell you where the chain, the chain. What about Cologne? Probably try it. That's it. Your card Anwaar right and pull out the green Polo had a green polo has got that shit too. You know what's the fucking stand by old spice? God Damn. I still use well it's nice after old spice was good. You didn't shower in that time and just throw it on. Throw those medicine.

Speaker 4:          00:37:05       Yeah, dad's kit. You bought them. Did you hear about that fucking guy that cut some dude's throat? He was one of those uh, one of those straight razor or shaver dudes and a barbershop. Oh No. He just sliced this dude's throat and ran away. Yeah, and they caught him and apparently had a history of mental illness. Didn't even know the guy who's throaty cut. Just slashed this fucking guy's throat. Shit. Yeah, the guy lived. God's going to be okay. It didn't do a good job of thrash and his throat, Mr. Big artery, or maybe he was able to plug it up. Whatever the guy did, but fucking amen. That's like the, the number one thing that everybody's worried about. What those fucking straight razors, you know, like what would happen if I just randomly got a nut and this nut decided to cut my throat.

Speaker 4:          00:37:48       That's why I go to dollar shave club. Joe, look at this sentence to Barbara. Thursday to 10 years in prison for inexplicably slashing customer's throat during a haircut and shave before peddling away on his bike. You guys, Navy Petty Officer Timothy Von 33 was at Vic's barbershop in imperial beach, just south of San Diego for a haircut. And October when Barber Daniel, Roberto Flores calmly slashed a straight razor across Vons. Throat twice. Whoa. Mr. Flores. Waiting until people left the room to street. Deputy district attorney, Laura Evans said he insisted on trimming the victim's beard. He said, I could cut your throat. And then he did Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          00:38:32       I want to know what was leading up to that though. Was the guy being a, you know the odd, the petty officer was he just like being a jerk the whole time looking at me. He said his, uh, his training as a medic kicked in the guy whose throat got cut and allowed him to save his own life despite severe injury and blood loss. It's been hundreds of hours of physical therapy, surgery and psychiatric treatment trying to recover fucking a man to damn who? They didn't know each other. There was no conflict or argument before the attack. That's so crazy. That's only 10 years in jail. What's, how's that guy got to get fixed? What are they going to let him out in five? If it doesn't kill anybody, how, how's that going to go?

Speaker 2:          00:39:13       Like anybody who does that, you need to kill that person. You don't put them in jail for 10 years. You out of your mind field and Texas and let Ted Mnuchin a helicopter and shoot at them. Pigs take them down to where Ted news just shooting those pigs. Shoot him in the knee caps. Just let the pigs eat them. Fuck you. I'd rather watch that. Yeah, fuck you. Fuck you. You can't just do that. You can't get out of jail in 10 years. That's crazy. 10 years. Not that much time. 10 years ago was 2005 that's not enough time to go to jail for trying to kill someone with a straight razor and I'll probably be out in eight. Fuck that. That's ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          00:39:51       Did you watch Jeff Ross's roast of the no, I did not. I heard it was awesome. I've seen it. I heard it was great though. I love the fact that he did it. I want to talk to him about it cause he wrote a really good thing for the Huffington post the other day about the system. About the penal system. Not understanding it once you get inside of it and see how how fucked up in nightmare I should is the girls were pretty hot in there. Really? Yeah. There was a few really hot ones. No Shit. Yeah, it was kind of weird. I would imagine there's a lot of crazy bitches that are hot and fuck up and do something stupid. One up getting locked up. That makes sense. Why would you think that girls in prison wouldn't be hot? I know because of me. How many crazy girls do you have? I dated that we're one step away from being in jail or oh yeah. You could have gotten a few of them arrested if right.

Speaker 2:          00:40:34       I want to me judging a friend that just got out after nine months, like a nine and a half on a scale. I want to tag how a motherfucker hot though. Yeah. All of that's all right. Yeah. You, you get them to the point where they're ready to kill you. Yeah. And then somehow or another you escape with your life sucks. But if there was a fucking camera on the wall, oh, there's drop cams everywhere nowadays show. Oh, I got that shit secured. God Damn, dude, I don't know what you're doing. Everybody gets mad at you. I'm not doing enough, I guess. Whatever it is.

Speaker 6:          00:41:12       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:41:12       Do you have, do you, do you usually have crazy girls in your life, Jim? Oh yeah. He's a comic. Yeah. Mostly my whole life. Your whole life pretty much. Was there one that was most crazy? Like was there a good story to it? Milligan of them? I'm trying to think, but yeah. You always attracted to it. Yeah. I always wanted the crazy one after the show. I was dancing on top of the bar. Whipping her out. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       Going to be fun. Yeah. Ooh. But depending upon how crazy the personality is. I met a gypsy the other day and I remember we talked about Gypsy's recently. Uh, I think we were sitting in this chair song. Yeah. But she's a gypsy. She doesn't have a house. A house? No. Does that mean she just goes from one millionaire's house to another million? She's a millionaire. Gypsy girl. Wow. Just hangs out. She's like, yeah, just hang out at by pools and stuff. There are girls that are like that. There's guys I know guys like that. He's always like, he's an older gentleman and he's kind of quite a bit of money and he's in his sixties he's never been married and a hill invite like really hot chicks to stay at his place and they live with them all the time. Like he's always got like some new nutty 10 let's live in with them.

Speaker 3:          00:42:18       And I want like, what do you and you fucking her. I was like, wow, I'm trying. I'm like Jesus Christ like, but he would like bring them in and that was the thing. He would be like buy them stuff, get them cars and they could live with them, you know, and he would try suit. He was like, it's really mismatched cause he's not a good looking fellow. He would also, he would bring them in and they would live with them. And he tried super duper hard to get it. Sometimes you get it, but oftentimes it just be a disaster. They couldn't, he couldn't get laid and he's paying for everything and they're living with, I would do it, I would have a new guy rule, but I've been in the cars and stuff, but they can just crash there. No guy rule. I can't bring guys over. No guys.

Speaker 7:          00:42:54       Yeah. Sometimes you know it sounds like a sugar daddy thing. I had just strip, I used to date, she had a sugar daddy and she would just buy them all a sh buyer, all the shit, which is Greg because I didn't have to buy it. And then I got the appointment. I go, you know what? Maybe he should stuck at me some shit cause I'm letting her go out. He's trying to fuck her obviously. Oh. And I'm like, oh gosh, do I remember it was a VCR. I'm like, well get me a VCR because I don't want to put up with their shit. Me and, and then she come on with a VCR. It's like I need a PCLR. I'm like, beautiful. I actually went on a date with them in a limbo and pretend that I was the guy friend and bad mouth myself for an hour in front of this guy.

Speaker 7:          00:43:23       You know, don't have boyfriend of hers. Like a, yeah, he's a real dick. Oh my God. And we went to a mall and I picked out like the like 20 cds he bought me and I think he bought me like a, I forget what was like a Walkman at the time or something like that. I'm like, yeah, I'll take one. And I'd be like, sure, you seem like a good dude. This fucking bad. My mind and the guy's holding her hand and the Limo and I'm just sitting there like the friend am, I don't give a shit. I'm getting cds. It's a strong pimp move. I tried to get a TV but it he wasn't going forward.

Speaker 3:          00:43:50       Wow. See a lot of these guys that rocket like this, the reason why they have two is because of prostitution laws. If prostitution was legal, there's a lot of these older creep Zoya dudes that are just out there trying to make it happen. It just tough action, you know, unless you're paying for it, very tough to get someone love you for who you are. They're like, if you had these really high standards and your gross, yeah, but if you've got a ton of cash and prostitution's legal, if they just made prostitution legal in America, you'd have exactly the same amount of hose. Okay. Exactly the same. Listen to me, they're not going to. More people are not going to be hoes. Hoes are hoes are ready.

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       They're just doing it in weird ways and maybe it'd be better. Prostitution was legal. He found a exactly who the home safer. Exactly. Tax Pay. Exactly. Amazon one click. Right. Nothing wrong with it. It's just sex. Is it okay to get, get a massage? Yes. It's okay to pay someone to suck your deck. It just is. Yes, it should be. You know, and these guys shouldn't have to move these fucking girls in. Buy Him cars. It's rude by the guy friends, VCRs, and I shouldn't have to do it. I felt bastard. He's, I'm figuring he's trying to bang my check. Right. So at least I should get some gifts out of it. Now, how did you wind up ending this whole relationship? You know, it was a stripper, so it was just, I mean with him, I get him out of your life. It seems like you would want some return for his investments he was doing at what?

Speaker 2:          00:45:22       He was juggling like three different ones and he just never, I think he was fucking wine, but he wanted to fuck all three and course and my check had boundaries while she said it wasn't, no, I wasn't around. She said she was no way. I'm not going to sleep with him, but that he bought her tits to, she wanted me to buy her tits, tits and he bought her tits. Holy Shit. Did you, did you guys go to dinner with this guy? Yeah, just, yeah, we went to dinner. Not just at night. I only met him that one time. Oh, okay. I'd be at the Bardo cause you know, shook it down. He always comes in a strip club and sits there and all the girls come around. I was right across the bar just sitting there just watching this guy. I'm like, I'm fucking that tonight.

Speaker 2:          00:45:59       Keep giving her money. Oh, let's just take a meter to diner. She's taking me to dinner later with that money. Okay. You're the guy when the always people always talk about like strippers, crazy boyfriends. That's you. Yeah. Yeah. It was like the central one and I was like cutting lawns at the time. I was making like eight bucks an hour and this guy's truck and this guy is probably big at like 300 grand a year, so that's pimpin. You're tactically pimpin. Yeah, in a way, you know. I mean not full on Pimpin, but that's pretty [inaudible] respect. I really needed a PCR. Yeah, I did. I just, I respect that hustle. I've done the same stuff. I've added things too when I did it. Veronica Ricci, I added things to her. Amazon wishlist, like Xbox games and stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:46:44       This is a new world, this world of Amazon wishlist where girls can say, I want you to buy me stuff. Like they have a list. We go and you can just buy their shit.

Come on, I'll find one for you. Didn't find if it's Thomson grow. I highly doubt it. I highly doubt Chrysler has one too. No, I don't think any of them have a wishlist. Wishlist where they want you to buy them. Shit that could see like a struggling comic that has got no money. It's like, Hey, if I can get some whatever, if I need something, maybe Ben, the someone that's established, but there's no reason for that. I can't even see a struggling comic doing it.

Speaker 2:          00:49:39       He's got last man standing on DVD. I'm going to ask him right now. He's got red state a grass. Uh, he's got a bunch of movies mall. I survivals tail white. This is what he wants from people. I think so this might, I mean it's just as wishlist. It's not like, like a lot of people have wishlist but I don't think they like pimp them out. Like hey you know, here's my wishlist. Buy me something. It's more of like things that they're, they want to get eventually. I think you know I'm going to ask him, do you have an Amazon wishlist? If so lose my number. Yeah, he actually, he's has a few of them. It looks like he has a few of them. Yeah. Let me, let me see if Joey Diaz has one so I bet he does. It's all shit. His wife wants

Speaker 3:          00:50:29       that. That is that wishlist thing is very strange. What's going to be way, way stranger is that within two or three decades we're not even going to have to go to the store to buy shit. Like everything leave be sent to you through the internet or it's going to be three d printed. That's going to be the vast majority. Fuck yeah. I mean as long as it makes sense like size wise, like you could three d print a table this big in the in the machines that most people are going to have in their houses. But I really believe that there's going to be a time in our lives where people are going to be making most of the stuff that they are going to download instructions and have a fucking printer in their house. It prints it just like it prints a an image. They're going to be able to do that with actual three dimensional things like with high certainty.

Speaker 8:          00:51:14       Did you know that uh, uh, did you see that new printer where it's like a liquid based uh, printer where it doesn't, it prints different, it's a different kind of three d printer technology that they just may, where it actually comes from the bottom and they use like an error. So like it pulls the item out of all like a liquid bad ass.

Speaker 3:          00:51:33       Yeah. There's a few different methods. They use different ways of heating the little particles, those little pellets they use to fill. It's a bunch of different methods of doing it, but apparently they're saying that like what we're seeing is the infancy. This is like the model t's of these fucking things. Just like old printers. You remember those sprinters was, it did. It did. It did. It was super slow and shitty and it was blocky. Never really looked, told like you like dark at the top and the bottom and be light. They were dog shit. Dot Matrix Printer. Now you can do, you can get these fucking printers that print photographs on photograph quality paper and it looks like an HD photo. You're like, Holy Shit, I'm looking at like a really nice photograph and you can print it off of a home computer printer. It's fucking nuts. Well, they're going to have that with this 3d shit.

Speaker 3:          00:52:19       They're going to have three d objects and you're going to just need the raw materials. You're going to have like a jug of aluminum and you know a big fucking thing of all the different minerals that you're gonna need to create these things. And then the computer is going to figure out where to put everything. It's going to be nuts. It's going to be really weird. Real weird. Now they're going to be able to do with biology. That's when Shit's gonna get real weird. If, if technology continues where they're, they can manipulate biology and they're pretty close to be able to do that. Now they're doing weird. Different things are splicing different genes and shutting off different genes and punched once. If they do that and then that becomes so commonplace that it starts getting its hand somehow or another in the public of that.

Speaker 3:          00:53:03       But public gets a hand on it and the public community and relate their own DNA. Like you can have your own build a pet. Like you have a machine where you can build a pet, people are going to make like half polar bear have fucking Hawk things. I mean just imagine how fucking bizarre once people can actually manipulate life and create like their own versions of animals and shit, which just to be chaos. Yeah. You just choose the perfect puppy. Like, I want to shit too, but I want to have that black on the back and white in the front and it just prints it out and it comes to life immediately. And if some asshole uses it wrong cue mansion if feel like hanging out in your house and the next door neighbor's house explodes with baboons. Baboons are running out of his house, like just fucking asshole on his printer.

Speaker 3:          00:53:47       He's making these fucking Babbo. It's full grown baboons. He prints them out and they just come tumbling out of some chamber that he's gotten his basement. That's a lot of there. I mean they're going to be able to do some weird shit. That thousand years. Think about a thousand years ago, the best shit you had was a horse. That's the best thing. The wagon behind the horse. I mean that's okay. If you had some shit you had to pull around, but the horse was, the way he got around the idea that you could fly a plane. Like if you could go back to the 12 hundreds and tell them about air travel, how easy it is to get to Paris. How easy it is. Like in a day you could be in China, they'd be like, what the fuck are you even talking about, man? But yeah, you getting a two and it flies to the, shut the fuck up.

Speaker 3:          00:54:29       Just stop. That's what it's going to be like for us thousand years from now. What they're going to be able to do with bodies and with, with electronics and what they're going to be able to do with technology, it's going to make, we're living in the cave era. We're living in some bizarre like static world that we can't manipulate and that's going to seem ridiculous to people in the future. Will they be able to cure cancer? I want Jane Diseases that won't be on it. So people will live to whatever age. I can't imagine. I think there's gonna come a point in time if you, if you just follow the curve, right? Go back from how quickly people died of illnesses a thousand years ago, how most illnesses that came along, they were pretty severe. They'd have a big impact like you, you would, you could easily lose 20% of the population of your city and some sort of a plague.

Speaker 3:          00:55:13       And they had a bunch of those, the bunch of plagues they had plagues that wiped out 60 70% of the population and they have just an insane plagues. That doesn't really happen anymore. Okay. So just think about the, all the different medications that scientists have come up with, all the different treatments for diseases that medical biology is constantly evolving and getting better at figuring out a way to detect things early. And it's safer time to be like a person who needs medical assistance now than ever before, ever. In human history part far, this is not even, not even a remote comparison. Right? Well, if that keeps going, where's it going? It's getting better. They're getting better at fixing bodies. They're gonna be better at fixing bodies, and eventually there's going to be genetic manipulation. When those two things combined, it's like the only thing that's gonna kill you as trauma.

Speaker 3:          00:56:00       Only thing that's gonna kill people. It's like accidents and things that they can't fix. That's what's going to kill people and they're going to get some heart attacks. They're going to get to a point where they can fix all that shit. They're going to be able to reintroduce different genes into your body, so there'd be able to introduce different genes to your heart that make your heart work different. They have this fucking shit that they're working on. That spider silk. It's, it's an artificial human skin that's a hybrid with spider silk. It's going to be bulletproof. They're going to have bulletproof human skin. If this works, Holy Shit. Exactly. What they're going to be able to do a thousand years from now is outside of the realm of anyone's imagination. The, the history that we studied today, when you study Alexander the Great, when you studied Gingiss con, if you had to go back in time that far, the way they lived, you would still kind of understand it.

Speaker 3:          00:56:52       You know, you'd still, we understand the way they live. We understand that. They wrote her on horseback. They got their water from the river. They had a hunt for their food. They had no refrigeration. There's constant war and struggle. We understand that it's, they still seem like people, but what they're going to be a thousand years from now is going to be nuts. It's going to be fucking bananas. Everyone's going to be 20 years old. There's going to be no disease and we're going to be freaks. They're going to be able to manipulate your genes. You, you could be like a half eagle person. He could run around with feathers grown off your deck. That's not outside the realm of possibility. Things are going to get real. If you have today like people you're allowed to go, I mean, and you should be, you're allowed to go to any one of those body modification places and they put fucking plates and your forehead and stretch your ears out and cut your lips off or whatever nutty shit you want to do. Why not let them do it? Who Cares? But if you want to be like a half ego person, Ooh, what? You're going to grow talons. You're going to be happy. Go person like we didn't even know you should you be able to live in a city now that's going to happen. Half Eagle people are going to be a reality

Speaker 4:          00:57:57       analogy, so what happens? All the pharmaceutical companies would all are with no more sickness and all that other stuff. It's 20% of our oh cheese. Oh my God, that lip window. Whoa, that's, that's rough yet. Oh my God. Is that real? Yeah. Oh my God. That guy's out a hole in the side of his face like a second mouth and he sticks his tongue through it. Oh my God. That's crazy. Yeah. Oh Geez. How did they drink koolaid? It just comes out their mouth. I guess they have to use a straw. Everything there must have to drink everything with his draw. Imagine watching that dummy eat. Blowjobs squirts right back at you. What is that one of the, in the group down there with the Tattoo. That guy. What is going on with him? Oh my Jesus Christ. Holy Shit. Fuck. What is he doing? Look at this nose as these giant holes. His nostrils. He's had holes not in the bottom where the nostril hole is, but on the sides, holes created and then stretched way out the size of a quarter so you can see right into his nasal cavity. And then he's got those enormous ears, stretchy things, which I've gotten pretty used to. They're so normal now and he's got tattoos all over his face and his side of his head and his eyebrows and Jesus. Fuck Dude. What happened and how well, who did you wrong son number.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       Simpler Times where he just had it on the left side. You weren't gay, the right side. You were gay. Now that's all it was.

Speaker 4:          00:59:28       Did anyone that you knew when you were growing up have a facial piercing? Never. No. No. Right? I can't think of anybody. You know we had hoops or not hoops, but I mean, did you meet anyone that even at a nose ring, when did you meet someone with a nose ring? Nose Ring was college about 93 yeah, that's what I saw. Chick started went and guys toe. Yeah. I'm trying to figure it out. When I saw my first nose ring. Joe, didn't you have your belly button pierced? No, it was my deck. I was going to have it connected to my belly button with like a chain, like a wallet chain. Did you have, did you have any hearing? I had to, I had to it in the last year. You couldn't put it in a ride. I had a fake diamond, but it would wear a gold hoop. Gold. Who? It's his picture.

Speaker 2:          01:00:11       Joe. I saw you on Ariadne's uh, Instagram wearing the extensions that will put some of my hair on. That was funny as fuck. I think I was actually Megan's Megan old Levy. The, I'm a broadcaster interviewer. Yeah, I think it was her hair. I don't know whose hair it was one of those chicks I still funny to see or any style. It helped with getting the checks. So it was always covered. My Dad didn't like it so I, I take them out when I wasn't around, but he couldn't see it anyway because my hair was really long. But he need some peacock feathers, man. But Bond Scott from ACDC had an earring and each year I said, and you're like, wait a minute, you too. So some guys would go with both like, Hey, I'm not, you know, cause if it was in the right ear, that meant you were gay. But if you had them both, he's like, well, Bon Scott had my bald so I can have in both. I never went bold move. I know it was the both Eddie Bravo used to do it. I do both. Awesome. I could still do it in both there. They're both still. They haven't grown together yet. How dare you? So weird.

Speaker 4:          01:01:03       Yeah, it's a, we are saying what you're allowed, but it's weird what you're allowed to and not allowed to. I'm not allowed. Me Personally, I'm not allowed to hang out with anybody that his eyebrow piercings. If you're a dude and you know, vibe Raul piercings. I looked in my rules and I go, oh look, I'm so sorry I have rules. I don't hang out with any dudes of eyebrow piercing. I gotta go. I liked that role. That's fair enough. But it's, it's different. Like Cara Santa Maria was our friend is awesome. She's got a lip ring and normally I look at people with lip rings. I'm like, what is that dumb shit about? Well I got metal coming out of your face, but she could pull it off. Like it just depends on the individual. It doesn't even, I don't even notice it. She has a lip ring.

Speaker 4:          01:01:45       It just seems like a part of her. She's so smart and interesting. Talk to doesn't really kind of affect how you think of her, but a lot of people like you meet a girl with a lip ring like listen crazy. What's going on with your face? Huh? I ain't got there. Three ring binder come down here. Fucking lip. I don't like the pussy periods because I feel I'm going to tear it or rip it or something and then it just, I don't like it. That's a strong statement to grow. It gets her pussy pad. I've had a couple of, it doesn't really do anything. I know down. Woo, what are you doing down there? Why am I adding hardware? One this one check at a little bar bell.

Speaker 3:          01:02:21       She was you lifting weights was a pussy. Well, some girls will do key goals, you know? I mean that's essentially like doing some Bruce Lee dynamic tension exercises for your pussy. She could masturbate by just tying a kite to it. You know Bruce Lee used to do that. Bruce least fucking, he's to do these exercise where you're just tensed up. Girls do that with their poster that it works too. Well, there's a woman in Russia, they can carry weight. She has the world record for the amount of weight that she can carry with her pussy. Like she shove something up or post it clamps down on it and she can lift weights. Like I'm talking like fucking heavyweight, like 50 60 pounds. Pussy. Yeah. It's like a vice grip in there. This is a Russian woman. I wouldn't want my cock in there. Yes, you probably wouldn't.

Speaker 3:          01:03:05       First of all, you wouldn't because you wouldn't want to put your cock in the pussy of a woman who's been practicing something like that. Like what is wrong with her that what she's, she's not just practicing it. She's entering contests. It's not like she's at home in the privacy of her own home. I'll get, she's got some stuff stuck in their pussy and she's dangling like a noodle or something. She's so she's got it in between her legs. Okay. But um, so she holds a world record for the amount of weight that she can carry. I don't know if it's hers. It's her. It's all in Russia. Oh. So now she's got an actual physical weight that she's hanging from her pussy. This is insane. Look at this. She's picking up this heavyweight with her. Was He? Oh my God. Ain't nobody got time for that.

Speaker 3:          01:03:49       She's just letting you know that she will fuck the life out of you. That don't come near me. She's just letting you know. If she gets a hold of you, that Super Pussy, she's going to lock on to you and you're going to have to use 50 60 pounds of force just to get away from her. That's a fucking statement. That's why you just try for anal first. Go right to the ass. Yeah. Just go right to the assets are not like, you know, I like this better and then we'll, we'll get to the pussy. Could you imagine what kind of ask power she has and everyone has asked me or right. People used to clenching and shits holding in farts. You know, that's a common thing, but to, I don't know. How common is it for girls to actually work on tightening their pussy?

Speaker 8:          01:04:27       Have you had a girl ever squeezer asshole muscle while you're in her asshole before? No. It's cool. No, I never did either. They were just mad. I was in there. There were clenching their fists. It's weird. I'm sure she's trying to shut you out. Sorry. That's just trying to cut. It's an analogy for your whole life. I went through this part where this girl was dry. I dated for a long period of time. It's mad at me for it. So for a month she wouldn't let me have vagina sex that could only have butts sex and you think that sounds awesome. But after like the third day, it's just awful. But that was one thing that she would do all the time just to do. That was her punishment. Yeah. It was a horrible punish. You think that's a great punishment? That's a horrible punish. Why was it horrible? Because you don't want to miss x more than three times. You know? You're like, all right, I'm done. I don't want this anymore. You know?

Speaker 3:          01:05:12       So she was like trying to play like some sort of psychological game. Just give you the ass and then you will never ask they ass again. Right?

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       Hmm. That's the kind of girls that Dave, Brian, that's how they think that or why I don't like it anymore, man. And that you do that squeezy thing. She'll do that squeezy thing and it just feels like there's like something else in there. It's just too tight. Just too sharp corners. It's like the Samsung Edge. How many girls do you think actually like work on that? Do those key goals? Is that a common thing? Yeah. Especially yoga girls. Definitely yoga girls. Yeah. Cause they're just tightening their pussy all the time and yoga. And there's like exercises you could do when you're just sitting. You could also use those balls and stuff. Like dudes can do that too. Right? That's those. Um, for uh, uh, Kama Sutra, you know, the, the, the different strategies of, uh, what's that type of, uh, what does that type of, um, tantric, thank you.

Speaker 4:          01:06:01       What are you supposed to hold in your calm and not supposed to have orgasm on edge all the time? Joe, you ever edge is supposed to like just hold, hold, oh, well supposed to keep it inside of you and if you can hold it tight enough, apparently you internally orgasm internally. I don't know what that means. I guess you have the same feeling, but it's more intense, but you don't come. So you're probably also an idiot by the time of the third week rolls around. All you're thinking about is how fucking horny you are everywhere you got like Jesus Christ because you haven't common three, four weeks. It's terrible idea. That's what people used to do when they didn't have cable. You know, they'd practice different ways to hold them there. Calm. Just to make life more interesting. Just just hurry up and come and watch game of Thrones.

Speaker 4:          01:06:45       Just get in there. I'd rather a lot of just slide out for a second. I, oh, sorry. I, you know, give me a second. I think I heard someone's at the door to suck a regroup. I'm not going to hold it in. Clench down that muscle. So weak. Even if you lift weights like you, you could have like the best grip. Give a guy a fucking manly hand shake. How all your bud. Nice to meet Ya. You'd be a stud, but that muscle that controls your Dick. Every guy's got this week just fucking lazy. It gets tired and fatigued. Easy. Like you could clamp your jaw shut for a fucking hour. You get to fuck up you, you clamp your Dick tried to squeeze down your Dick for 20 seconds, you're ready to blackout. It's just such a weak muscle like right now, try squeeze your Dick Hall. Also.

Speaker 4:          01:07:38       I have no endurance on my dick squeeze muscle. I wonder if you practice it, would it really get to a point where you could be like the male equivalent to that lady that carries bricks in her pussy? What is this? How men, how can men do Kegel exercises? Why would they do that? Halfway through urination? Try to stop or slow the flow of urine. Yeah, that's possible. It's not fun. Don't tense the muscles in your buttocks, leg or abdomen, and don't hold your breath when you can slow or stop the flow of urine. You've successfully located these muscles. Okay? So don't tense the muscles in your buttocks, legs

Speaker 3:          01:08:15       or abdomen, and don't hold your breath. Okay, so you're, you have to figure out how to stop the p from the middle, like some instead of like squeezing your butt. Like if you had to stop peeing in the middle of PN who'd clamp your butt shot, you would squeeze down your Dick and you would try to stop the stream. What they're saying is don't tense the muscles in your butt, your legs or your abdomen, and don't hold your breath that you could actually just develop a squeeze that could stop pee from coming out without, without moving anything else, but your deck muscles can't believe

Speaker 4:          01:08:49       I'm talking about can you flip your pick up and hit your belly like, like we were in. It's hard. Can you like flick? It was really ridiculous. Questions are stupid as fuck. Now. Can you do that? Can you move your Dick? Who knows Brian? No one's sitting around moving their deck. What? The hotties out your hands?

Speaker 8:          01:09:05       Yeah, just flick it up. What? You can't do it? Yeah, you got my balls way mind down so it's not going to go off. Yeah, I could flick it. I can just like sit there and just be like, if it's hard I could just go like flick night and flip my stomach. That stuff. They can do that dude. He's just said he can't.

Speaker 4:          01:09:18       I know you're talking about, no, you're talking about and it's so worth it to us. He's like, I can muscle like remember when you're five and your friend nipple first learned how to whistle. I can whistle. Can you whistle? Everybody can fucking whistle. All right dude. Yeah, get smacked my belly. Every guy who has a hard on can do that. If your dick gets hard, you tense it up. It hits your stomach. That's how it's designed. My molds shots when I want to pull it cools. My mom plays to like close it, but she didn't even know how to do that.

Speaker 8:          01:09:46       Can you flip back or a pen in your mouth? What you like flip it. You put a grape on the head of your deck and it flip it up. Do you do that? I can do that. You've never done that? I've done that. Definitely done. I've done that. You put a grape on your deck and flipped it in your mouth? I don't believe in them. No, I didn't get my mouth. I said try to flip it in your mind. How far does it go up? Uh,

Speaker 4:          01:10:10       first of all, I don't believe that at all because I believed that if you did start it and you got close to your mouth, you would keep flipping into your face until you caught it around with me. No, Joe, I can do it. Why should you put it on your helmet? Flip it up. Yeah. Did you get brain damage this weekend or something to haul it away? It's not smoking real. So something wrong with you. You seem like there's really something wrong with you today. Your sentences are so ridiculous.

Speaker 8:          01:10:33       Very not smoking cigarettes and I have it. I slept with a patch on, I forgot to take off.

Speaker 4:          01:10:38       Yeah, you cannot leave those on the kill. You at least give you a heart attack. So throw that out though. Don't leave that on my table. You creep. It's that real. Why that you can't sleep with it cause I've, yeah, you're not supposed to sleep with them. It's intense. That's true. I'm pretty sure. Pretty sure it's supposed to take those off. There's like a bunch of different rules to those things and you can't have too many of them. Like people have like four or five of them on and died. You gotta be fucking careful. You get at those patches like especially the variant strength, you know you're supposed to wean yourself off to a lighter and lighter patches. The lightest one. It's just seems fucked up to me. The nicorette gum makes the most sense. It's the grossest you'd taste nicotine and you want it. It

Speaker 8:          01:11:14       makes me puke. Like I will literally Puke if I, if I hadn't the nicorette nicotine gum or the mints. It has like this weird nicotine tastes, that

Speaker 3:          01:11:21       soluble Mark Marin's strategy. He just keeps chewing the nicotine gum. He's been on the nicotine gum for like 10 years bosses the same way. Guys. Been Nicorette gum for a year. I think Marin's actually done with the gum now. I think it's completely free of the good for him. That's a hard fucking monkey. Just the kick that's cigarette monkey seems like to me. Out of all the things that I've seen, people kicked cigarettes seems to be the toughest. Does not the toughest, the consequences of going back on it because if you see guy, he's got a heroin problem, then he's, he kicks it and then he goes back on heroin. He's all fucked up. His life's a mess. But if you see God kicked cigarettes and comes back, it's just smoking a cigarette, you know? It was like, ah, I quit for a little law I couldn't play.

Speaker 3:          01:11:58       But he's still right there talking to you. You know what I'm saying? It's not like someone to quit something like math or something fucking crazy. That ruins your life really quick. Cigarettes is a nice slow burn. But if you can take that out of it and you look at it objectively like how many people do you know that were former drug addicts? Oh, I know all lot. A lot of dudes who had problems with drugs. How many dudes do I know that had a problem with cigarettes and did successfully kick it? Not that many. Only a few. I know a lot of people that struggle with that shit hardcore you, you struggled with it hardcore are, he still says he gets cravings for it and he kicked it a long fucking time ago. Um, Dunkin's still gets cravings, you know, he'll still have a cigarette every now and again. Joey will have allow himself a cigarette every now and again, which I think is like super fucking dangerous.

Speaker 8:          01:12:48       Joey. Joey actually always doesn't, he always smoked. There's like e-cigarette things all the time.

Speaker 3:          01:12:52       Sometimes he does, but you remember back in the day he would allow himself a cigarette every now and then. Fuck it. Whatever. I'm not a cigarette. He's just sitting there smoking a cigarette. But he had enough willpower to not go buy a pack and not keep going. But um, that seems to be like as hard a kick as anything because it seems to me like when people are like the, the heroin thing and like people have like severe pill problems. Like they look at those pill problems like, fuck, I hope those things don't get me again. You know, if they get off of them, they look at him like fuck like that's his fucking pills man. People don't look at cigarettes that way they look at it. It's, it's a much more casual thing cause it kills you so slowly.

Speaker 8:          01:13:30       Cigarettes though is have his has killed coffee for me. Like right now this coffee is horrible and I used to love coffee and I can't it, I don't even want to drink this coffee now. What are you talking about? Just because the, the whole cigarette and coffee thing together is kind of made what coffee was in my head. So now just this by itself, it's off white plus your taste buds are probably coming back now. What other smoke?

Speaker 3:          01:13:51       That's a big part of it, dude. You're do your taste buds get really fucked up. But cigarettes apparently.

Speaker 8:          01:13:56       Yeah. I haven't noticed that. I've just noticed zero energy. Like I can't stop sleep.

Speaker 3:          01:13:59       So weird to me that like chefs would smoke cigarettes. Like I don't understand that. Like Anthony Bordain used a small key quit is the cigarette break. Yeah. But it's still like if you're smoking cigarettes, how do you know exactly what things taste like of it numbs your taste buds?

Speaker 8:          01:14:15       I don't know how accurate that really is because I've quit before for like a year and I've never noticed anything with the d. The taste or the smell is as at least that drastic of something.

Speaker 3:          01:14:25       Hmm. I think that's a pretty commonly known thing. Like that taste buds come back all of a sudden full light you don't like anymore. Yeah, I don't think, I mean it probably varies. I mean maybe it doesn't affect you the way it affects other people like you. You think you have a pretty good sense of taste while you're smoking cigars.

Speaker 8:          01:14:42       I used to, I, I've noticed that my tastes like, I don't really taste things as much anymore, but I think that's just, cause I'm old. That doesn't even make sense. Dying don't they? When? When you get older.

Speaker 3:          01:14:55       So we're self diagnosing again. We did this the other day. I think that when you're smoking cigarettes, I think it's killing all sorts of shit in your throat. And the fact that it fucks with your taste buds. It's not surprising. You're smoking your taste buds. The taste buds are in your mouth. You're flooding your mouth with poisonous fucking smoke.

Speaker 8:          01:15:14       Do you still smoke? No, I, I stopped like 25 [inaudible] seven

Speaker 3:          01:15:17       years. It's a hard one to quit. One of the hardest ones to quit and way more common. Also fulfils other ones when like heroin or math or it's, it's way more common that people smoke cigarettes than do meth.

Speaker 8:          01:15:31       And I smoked for 25 years. Yeah. And you said you were up to, I only smoke like eight cigarettes a day. I wasn't a big smoker where you said two packs. Two packs of the last six months. Yeah. Were, yeah, that's why I quit cause I was like this is ridiculous. I'm smoking two packs a day now and I would be like, why am I smoking so much? And it was, why were you smoking so much? I think all the crap that's happened like the last six months. So that's a lot of cigarettes, dude. I stress. So you stopped and now nothing. Right, except this patch but no cigarettes at all for how long? Seven days. Whoa. And will they say you have to get over, what's the hump? They have like a list that's on the Internet that shows you like you know from like day two and three of quitting.

Speaker 8:          01:16:10       This happens and then a week and it, it, it, I think it's maybe three months at that list goes to like, and after the third month you'll have 98% less of a heart attack. Chance and really, and you're going to grow better fingernails. I forget what the list said, but it was involving taste and smells. Are you really going to stick with it this time? I don't know. Wow. That's not as strong fucking night owl. That's not the one who stayed one thing being at the comedy store has been really rough because that place for some reason you can still smoke on the patio and everywhere. Almost outside. Yes. Well all the other bars, you can't even smoke on patios anymore. But I think cause it's a, and maybe you should shut the fuck up so they don't get rated. Know they know, but, but uh, but, but it's so, so much smoke. Everyone smokes. It's, it's like you get secondhand smoke. Well, I just can't stop thinking about it. So when you go there, now, what do you do? Uh, I just, I'm just dead inside. I don't know. Oh, here's the thing.

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       Yeah. Isn't that crazy? After 20 minutes, your blood pressure drops to normal. Pulse rate drops to normal temperature in hands and feet increase in normal eight hours. Carbon monoxide levels in blood drops and normal. Wow. It takes eight hours. 48 hours. Nerve endings start regrowing like, and it's just like a smell and taste is enhanced just 48 hours outside of cigarettes. See, there you go. Just six days. Doctors were saying cigarettes are good. Take him smoke. I'm doing commercials for them. I think it was earlier than the sixties, but maybe 50 shots, right. Was, um, in that j Edgar Hoover movie and the j Edgar Hoover movie. Uh, what's his name? Uh, what the fuck's his name? Vena. Leonardo Dicaprio is j Edgar Hoover and his mother is talking to him about the doctor prescribing cigarettes for him, like to match them up. Hey look, doctors five I'd have to one commercials.

Speaker 1:          01:17:58       Yeah, I see you see the ads cigarettes a good for yet small. Come look at that five years. Stroke risk reduced to that of a nonsmoker. Fights graders though. Still though. That's great. A risk of cancer of the mouth. Throat, esophagus is half that of a smoker in five years. Just five years. That's great. In 10 years, precancerous cells are replaced. Lung cancer death rate is about half the rate of a smoker in 10 years. Life expectancy comparable to a nonsmoker. If you quit for 10 years, that's beautiful. Smoker or a nonsmoker that works at a paint factory more way more fucked or black mold in your house. People that work in like fucking plants and factories like especially back before they knew what kills you and what didn't kill you like yeah. A lot of people got a fucking real bad deal like that. They found out about that as best as cause.

Speaker 1:          01:18:47       A bunch of dudes got cancer from as best as you know, from working on it. They used to have that as best as that. Remember that shit they used to a installation for all the old houses. Yeah. Houses are filled with cancer. My body used to work on these old buildings and the New York in the 80s, just just like a construction guy, whatever. He needs a new lung that was on a lung transplant list from all that shit. Just don't put shit in the garbage and destroying all ripping off walls and stuff like that. Well, you know, Donna summer died from lung cancer, I'm pretty sure, and she died because she lived near where the towers fell. A lot of people that live where the towers fell, including a lot of the firemen, a lot of the, like a lot of the, uh, the people that rescued people, EMT officers, all the, all the people that worked in that area.

Speaker 1:          01:19:32       There's a lot of people who got sick and Donna summer apparently lived, she had an apartment that was pretty close to that area and just the shit that was in the air. I mean you could only imagine a giant fucking building. That's what it was. It a hundred stories or something like that collapses. Another one collapses right next to it. All the fucking Dustin Shit that my building that's built in the early seventies so they, I'm sure to use this past us and, but then of course I was at EPA or something came in and they have to like the third day said he air quality's fine, it's harmless tooth and everybody just worked there and just hung out and they charity work and should always down there doing some helping move boxes and shit like that. Cause they're all right. I guess it'd be arrows.

Speaker 7:          01:20:07       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       All those first two drivers, all the people like the EMT people and the fire people and a lot of those guys get sick. A lot of cops got sick. A lot of people that live there that try to come back early, they got sick. It just only makes sense. I mean you, you're not going to have spring fresh air went to enormous buildings fall.

Speaker 7:          01:20:28       So that just got declassified the other day. Did you going to? If there's any new, some of it, but there's still a lot missing.

Speaker 3:          01:20:33       The nine 11 reports. Yeah. What do you think happened? I think exactly what they tell us exactly what they tell us. Pretty much two dudes in box cutters took over an airplane, flew into the twin towers. What do you think happened? Pretty close. I think most likely. Almost exactly like their talent. US, except for, well, I think they capitalized on an event and I think that's why it looks like they set it up. I think that's why one of the reasons why people have so much of a vested interest in like trying to prove some sort of conspiracy with the government and nine 11 it's cause there's so much profit that was made off those wars, especially the warder Iraq. That's the forget about like what happened at nine 11 and who caused that. But it's the reaction to not 11 that's the craziest thing ever.

Speaker 3:          01:21:28       The craziest thing is how we just decided to go to war with Iraq, you know, country that had nothing to do with it. And then how Burton's getting these billion dollar contracts, they're blowing shit up left and right and like that's, that's, that had nothing to do at nine 11 like theirs. That's like someone in like Marina del Rey, you know, picking a fight with you. So you knew Canada or, yeah, it's really that fucked up. It doesn't make any sense at all. They're totally different countries. Totally unrelated and that's the most fucked up thing about it is what they definitely did. Like the idea that it was planned, that it was like they flew through that that's like so complicated. Like I don't know if they really are even capable of doing that. I don't know if there's a group in the highest levels of government that's capable of hiring so many people to keep their mouth shut.

Speaker 3:          01:22:19       So many people to engineer this thing where you got to fly planes and the building's going to, are there people with box cutters? Are there Saudi guys that are on those planes? Are they, are they a fucking Hologram? How you cover all that? How do you cover the news story? How do you make sure that nobody keeps her mouth shut? How do you make sure that no bad motherfucker on the plane doesn't Chuck Norris, these fucking terrorist dudes in the head and take over the plane. How do you stop all that from happening? Because it seems to me that like it would be a lot of fucking, people would have to be involved

Speaker 7:          01:22:46       and one person's going to talk. Absolutely. One's going to fucking talk. Wired that building for explosives. Nobody saw him coming in. There's no video of anybody in at two o'clock in the morning. What about the janitor that mops up didn't see some guys cause they say, you know they had, the way it came down, it had to be explosives inside.

Speaker 3:          01:23:03       Yeah. The the one that's crazy. Tower seven. That's the crazy one because that was the one that wasn't hit by a plane. Yeah, but what, what freaks me out is not that, that they had to have explosives to des to detonate a building and make it collapse like that. That doesn't, I don't buy that because I don't think we've ever seen a fucking building that big collapse. Like how do you know once it starts going like first of all, what about the possibility that they used shitty engineering and terrible fucking concrete and the unions were involved and they fucking half assed that giant building and it fell apart when a plane hit it. That seems like the more likely scenario put that tower seven, which just goes like this [inaudible] that's the one that's the most crazy cause it looks like an implosion but apparently it was on fire and apparently, you know the, the entire building had like some sort of, uh, underneath the basement they had some sort of a diesel generator.

Speaker 3:          01:23:59       So they had these giant drums of diesel and it all caught on fire. So it was a raging inferno inside the building and some people think that compromise the steel and made it collapse like that. But it looks like a fucking controlled demolition. That's the one that really looks like it. Yeah. Twin Towers look like the, the top fell off and the whole thing just exploded from the weight. And when you see all those buildings that are shooting out that they say is reminiscent of explosions. Yes. But you know that the top of the building is coming down and crushing all those floors. Right? That's how the thing is getting crushed. Right. What is that? That's pressure. I would happen to me or pressure windows explode. That's that. Everyone knows that. So if you slow something down and you're showing these windows exploding because the top is collapsing in the building and you're saying that's evidence of bombs. No, it's not. No, it's not. It's evidence of explosions that are happening because of compression. There's a lot of things going on in that building. That building is fucking collapsing. It's fucking billions of pounds of metal and concrete and it's all falling apart. Like you looking at these little slow motion things and saying that's definitely bombs. It's not definitely bumps. It could be bombs, not definitely bombs though. It's more likely that that fucking buildings falling apart.

Speaker 7:          01:25:13       Supposedly when they built it, they had it where I was going to come straight down if there was ever out of a hurricane or something like that earlier. Yeah, that's what I remember reading a seen a documentary on the trip. The trade centers getting built in case dead, didn't want to just fall over and wipe out six streets. That is smart. If you said a belt, it like that in case something does come Kinda, you know like yeah, big hurricane or an earthquake came, it would just wipe out, you know, a bunch of blocks and they built it like that. That would fall straight down like that. I don't know how they did it, but I mean that's, that's what they said in a document. The Guy, the guys who documentary.

Speaker 3:          01:25:46       Because could you imagine if that plane slamming into the building caused that designed to kick into effect and that's why I collapsed either way, man. That's the only time in our lives and in the history of the continental United States. It's been attacked. You know, that's one of the most fucked up things about us in comparison to the rest of the world. Everybody's been attacked a fucking million. I mean, just look at all the shit that's happened in Mexico just in Mexico. Just fucking Cortez coming over here and kill him like a fucking million people. All the crazy as techs that were killing me. I mean, there's a lot of attacks and invasions and shit happened just in Mexico. Germany's been fucking attacked. Russia has been attacked. Everybody's been attacked. England's been hit with bombs from the Nazis. Everybody got attacked. Their spots and France are so fucked up to this day that you can't go in him for like a hundred thousand years.

Speaker 3:          01:26:40       They have like a red zone when they have this fenced up zone and France real all from the munitions, all from unexploded munitions and the toxins just from World War II. Dude, it's nuts. Pull, pull up that article too because it just, it was a recent article, photos of Francis Red Zone. It was amazing. I sent it to Dan Carlin, who is this guy who has his podcast called hardcore history and he's got this insane series on world war one and how fucked up world war one was. And this is a part of that, like this, this all these munitions and all those bomb shit. If it's a, it's an area the size of Paris and you can't even go near it. Wow. You find it? Check this shit out. It's fucking nuts, man.

Speaker 3:          01:27:23       This is all from the war and it's, well, this is like, there's, there's really good pictures of the actual place. What's that? Yeah. Right. It looks like a Zombie movie. Yeah. Yeah. He can't go anywhere near it. There's like a fence and then inside that fence it's fucking no man's land. You just can't get in there. They bombed that place literally to hell. And they had all these, and look at that, look at all, this is all the shit they're finding their, they have these, uh, animals that live there. And they did tests on the animals, like the wild hogs. And they, they were filled with toxins. All these horrible fucking chemicals from these explosives, explosives and what did explode, what leaked into the soil and they used gas and I mean this is a nutty fucking time. Look it fucking bombs. They foul just laying in a field. That was when war was war man. This Dan Carlin thing, if you don't know anything about World War One, I didn't know shit about world war one. This this Dan Carlin piece that he's got right now. It's amazing if you've never listened to hardcore history is the best podcast on on history. Yeah, it's amazing. And he's got this incredible piece on a World War One. That's that. He just finished, I think the last episode he just released. What a fucking nutty time dude. That was just a hundred years ago.

Speaker 3:          01:28:48       These people were fighting in trenches and shooting at each other from over the hills.

Speaker 3:          01:28:55       What's really crazy is they, these people in World War one in particular, they were still wearing like the brightly colored that people were in the 18 hundreds because they were in like their grandfathers fucking battle ladder battle outfits. They had outfits that were essentially like targets, like white gloves and white hats and they didn't have any helmets and they were walking it all walk, just walk, just walk in and fucking shooting people and then people would shoot back and they dig a hole and cry and scream. And that's how they did war. Fucking nuts, man down. And if it wasn't for them, we wouldn't be here. Salou God blessed those fine warriors. Accomplice fucked right. God blessed the troops cut. Y'All fucked does that, that that just a hundred years ago it was how they did war. This, this piece is a, the hardcore history thing. He talks about the Germans inventing these new guns that were so powerful. They used to have to plug up their ears, they'd plug up their nose, they would back up 300 yards and when the thing went off you still had to have your mouth open or it'll blow out your eardrums. So they're packing their packing their nose, they're packing their ears, they're plugging up everything. And you still have to have your mouth open when it goes off 300 yards away from you. Cause the reverberation, the sound is so powerful that it literally will blow your eardrums open.

Speaker 3:          01:30:17       And so they were shooting these fucking Volkswagen bus size bullets at a, the people on the other side of forget who they were shooting them amount. I forget which country it was they first used it on but it would just obliterate with one bullet it would obliterate like 70 people. One bullet would just take out 70 people and they were like, what the fuck? Before then it was like bullets [inaudible] at a time share hall, you should have me, I should have you Viva La France and you can fucking went out there and then the Germans took shit to the next level. They had this huge gun that they used to have like tanks would pull it and it was enormous. You're talking about this huge cannon of a weapon and then they had figured out the distance, like they had to figure it out, but like they would launch one bullet, figure out where you were and they would lower the gun. A little launch. A second bullet is nothing you could do, couldn't get away. It's things shooting you from miles away.

Speaker 8:          01:31:12       Were you watching that Dallas footage the other night? The uh, what do you mean a gunman?

Speaker 3:          01:31:17       No, I heard briefly about it. What happened? Some guy went nutty and shot at the cops.

Speaker 8:          01:31:22       Yeah, he got a armored car. Our van off of uh, looks like Ebay, somebody found the other day, the auction listing. Uh, and it was just completely armored and he was just shooting and stuff. But one crazy thing is if you, Jamie, if you look at my Twitter, I posted this video of a, of a guy named Scoota underscored juice man. And he was filming on the street when this was happening. The Guy, I'm the armored car was just shooting at cops hitting cop cars and stuff like that. And he had planted all these pipe bombs throughout the city. It was like grand theft auto is nuts, but this guy was shooting like filming it and a bullet you could hear wizard right by his head

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       is so intense. Oh my God. Fuck that. So do you remember that North Hollywood shootout? Yeah. Yeah. I was here for that. Yeah, we were on the set of news radio and we all huddled up in the, in the break room and watching on television. We were like, what the fuck? Watching these two dudes with full armor on and machine guns and shit just fucking gun down cops. Did you remember that? That wasn't the scene that they'd kind of recreated from the movie heat. Yeah. Yeah. That was the inspiration of it. Holy Shit. Yeah. That really happened. It was called the north Hollywood shootout to just maniacs to crazy dudes all fucked up on drugs out of their mind and just arm to the Dick. Just their trunk was stuff and cops had like regular service revolvers and you're like, what am I going to do with a fucking nine millimeter against these? I mean, what's going on here? And some were just so under gunned. So, um, I think they changed out shitload of laws after that too. About like how much machine guns you could have right now. What happens when he starts stockpile and that kind of ammo and bulletproof vests and shit. He said I was pretty much kind of the scene from that movie. He thinks that was the inspiration for it. Is this a the new one?

Speaker 3:          01:33:12       Oh, this is north Hollywood. Yeah. Okay. So these dudes, they have full on bulletproof vests, the whole deal. They like wearing military garb and then they, they have the trunk open and inside the car it's all guns. It's all guns and bullets. And this dude is like, he's all armored essentially. And so he's shooting at these cops and you know the cops are fucked there. They're hiding, they're waiting for backup. But it was, it was really scary because these guys are kind of idiots. And it makes you think like if someone who really knew what the fuck they were doing, like some real tactical guys like seals or something like that, or they went nutty and decided to do this, you wouldn't need a large group in order to shut entire city down. My friend Justin talks about this all the time cause he knows like a, a lot of people in special ops and all those, he's kind of a, he would call himself on a firearms enthusiast. I call him a gun nut. He's definitely a gun nut. But if you had a bunch of dudes that were like, really, I'm really good at killing people like this. And you just brought in 20 of them, they shut up, shut the entire city down. Absolute like, where was this dis on Hollywood boulevard. Now this is in north Hollywood. What's happening here? How come we're not seeing anybody? Shouldn't that anybody yet?

Speaker 3:          01:34:33       It's guys are lazy. Come on man. Okay, here it goes. So now there he's just running and shooting at cops.

Speaker 9:          01:34:42       Right?

Speaker 3:          01:34:43       I love these. It's wolf blitz or reporting on the news.

Speaker 9:          01:34:48       We'll throw it and we're its way here and see what happens. Oh, that's Tom Wolf Blitzer. Uh, obviously an a was here on this one.

Speaker 3:          01:34:54       Sounds a little wolfish. Yeah, definitely. Was

Speaker 9:          01:34:57       quite a radically possibly a wouldn't suspect at this point. And uh, we're keeping an eye on this right now. Let me just take a quick look back over to the right as the situation.

Speaker 3:          01:35:05       Yeah, I think that's dean. If you've got a shot. I think so. I think that guy is dead right? The guy in the car. That's why he's rolling. Oh, he's hurt. I forget what happened, but I remember the cops let him bleed out and people were saying that, uh, it was cruel that the cops didn't call the ambulances and and have this guy taking care of the risk, their own lives to do so to get this guy to, oh wait. Well he just took off staple this thing shut.

Speaker 9:          01:35:38       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:35:39       Like can a reason that John Wick movie? Yeah. Yeah. Did you see that movie? Yeah. It's fucking good movie man. I watched on a plane coming back from Mexico this weekend. It's a fucking bad ass movies. You see loss road yet? No, that was the best. Like as far as like action movie, that was the best action movie I've seen in a long time. It was bad ass. What's it called? John Wick. It's kind of matrix. It was pretty good. Well, it's not about the matrix at all. It's about his hit man who these Russian mobsters fuck with them and he decides to go after them and kill them all. It's just the gratuitous violence level is off the fucking chain. You got to check it out like murders that counter Reeves does in this movie. It's insane. I mean I've never seen the guy killed more people in a movie and do it.

Speaker 3:          01:36:21       It was fun to watch like the way he was doing it was bad ass. It was all most believable, you know, like the way they had it set up, everything that was like really tight quarters. It wasn't like a retard wagon train. When they have a bunch of guys coming out and somehow or another he managed to survive. You kind of buy it pretty much every step of the way. Like you know, there's not a real person who is that accurate with a gun. But if it's a video game, you know this, this could be possible. There was no scene where you go, it doesn't, how is it going to get out of this? It was one, there was one. They kind of gave you a way out. The kind of made sense. Good enough. Good enough. Cause the, the gratuitous violence and the action teens really make you want to go be a hitman. You want to just go fuck people. It's a fun movie. It's a wild fucking movie. I heard the Jurassic Park movie sucked.

Speaker 8:          01:37:08       I heard it was okay. Yeah, but I, it looks good. I, I'm sure I heard it was dumb. Do you see it? I saw it. It's really fun. Do you like everything though? It's trying to take funds. Last thing you don't like. Ah, I see plenty of movies. I don't like getting one pitch perfect. Two loves it. Loved it. Five to six hours. One uh, no I did not hurt. It was hard. It was enjoyable. But I wanted to say what you were talking about the twin towers before the drastic world movie cause it's in three d imax. They showed the trailer for this new movie with Jason Joseph. Gordon Levitt about this French, a tight rope walker that went between the twin towers in the 70s and eight recreated 1974 Manhattan. Whoa. We created the twin towers and it looked awesome. It freaked the shit out of you. I'll show you a picture.

Speaker 3:          01:37:53       Is it all CGI? Oh goodness.

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       Gravity s kind of

Speaker 5:          01:37:57       recreation of this whole scenario. Just the like where the

Speaker 4:          01:38:01       trailer starts out. I want to ruin it for you. Even now. You need to see it because it was awesome. I know. I need to see it right now. Have show that shit. Fuck. Or imax. It's three D as well. That's quite all right. All right. I can get the idea. This is insane. It's so cool. What they can do right now with CGI, unless that's on a window washers, cart, but just shooting it up to the top. It's the trade center. It's gone, right? Yeah. Good point. So this is all fake.

Speaker 5:          01:38:36       It's amazing. Come on. That's incredible. That's all fake. Oh my God. My fucking heart hurts. That view is insane. Oh my God. I'm literally freaking out and my hands are sweating. My toes won't stop twitching. He's killed.

Speaker 5:          01:39:03       So He's standing on top of the twin tower and you get to see what the fucking drop looks like in homeboy is now standing on an I beam poking out over the edge. I don't think I can watch this. Can you might do this in three Oh my God. I can't even imagine what I'm seeing. My own face. This man, his balance. That's, Oh, is it Jesus Christ? Boy, I'm having a really hard time watching him. Fuck. That has to be like one of the freakiest. Oh, you son of a bitch. He's standing on one foot. What do you mean a yoga master? Cagle oh my God. In Three d and Imax Three D. Ah, that's why I want a trailer.

Speaker 6:          01:39:56       The walk.

Speaker 4:          01:40:00       How crazy is that? That we give a fuck that he died, died. Did he? Does that? I mean, if he walked a tight rope and that type rope was six inches off the ground, you would not give a shit. Nope. No one would see it. Sweaty palms. But because he is a hundred stories up, you know that he's fighting every single instinct, every natural instinct. The body has to get the fuck away from danger. Fuck that notices in the French guy. Is it that they did doc documentary a few years ago back? Yeah. Okay. It's the same movie. Yeah. It was a documentary about this guy that had the footage of him fought from afar, but I didn't want to start a recent one with the family. Those, the family where the one guy with a lenders, is that what they are? One, one of them died and they still do it like the mother and the son did it and they passed each other on the rope. What the fuck man? You know? I mean what kind of a way to make a living is that I think you find out I'd be pissed

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       at my dad if that's what he did. Now I got to follow in your footsteps. How good do you think you could get? Do you ever think you could get good enough? Like maybe it's just us. Maybe we look at that and go,

Speaker 3:          01:41:04       look, man, it ain't hard. It's just we don't know how to do it. You know what I mean? Right. Like if, if, if you got really good, can you get good enough to a point where you could walk on one of those things with 100% certainty that you're not going to fall? Is that possible? Because look, if I got, if I made you a road across the Grand Canyon, but the road was only as wide as this table, I could walk it and I would not like it. I'd freak out the entire way. I try to stay calm, but if there's no wind and I knew that the road was his as wide as this table, I'm 100% confident that I'd be able to suck it up and make it to the other side. When I got to the side, I'd probably be like, what the fuck?

Speaker 3:          01:41:41       I'd probably be freaking out. How long do you think it would take? Yeah. I don't know how far the the walk is. How far is the walk? I wouldn't rush it a couple of hours. I wouldn't rush it. Yeah, you wouldn't walk fast. I would not. No, I would not. I would be fucking, I'll do it as a meditation. I would try to concentrate entirely on my breath and each footstep and just keep my balance good and stay calm. You put a table like I could get in this fucking table right now and I would, I'll tell you right now, never fall. I will never fall standing up on this table if, unless I slip on something. You know what I'm saying? But if I'm standing on this table right now, there's no way this is a flat thing. It's very wide. I'd be fine. And I could walk across the table with what certainty.

Speaker 3:          01:42:22       Oh, 100% certainty. Unless there's something really wrong with my body or I'm that fucking drunk. If I had a gamble, I would be 100% certain that I could walk across the length of this table. But if you made it a mile long and you put it over the Grand Canyon, that's where shit gets weird. You think you'd have to sit down at some point cause you're like freaking out maybe. But at the point is that anybody can walk on this fucking table. We all know how to walk. Do you think you can get good enough at walking on a tight rope? That it's almost like this table, you know, as far as like the probabilities, but someone can, right. I mean there has to be someone out there like if you watch those Cirque de Solei fuckers, they can do shit that doesn't seem like she'd be able to do it.

Speaker 3:          01:43:03       They can do stuff with their bodies. Like I saw one guy and he was pressing one guy. The other guy was doing a handstand with one hand holding this guy's hand. So this guy's got a hand and another guy's doing a handstand and maybe they were using two hands and they were holding, the guy was doing a handstand on the other guy's hands. They're standing up, it's fucking ridiculous. Who the fuck do you know that you can do that? Does anybody know anybody that can do that? No. Unless you know a Cirque de Solei dude or a Cirque de Solei Gal, but even they fuck up every now and then like one dropped a at the MGM couple of years ago, right? Wasn't it? It's super risky. You're watching that Cirque de Solei.

Speaker 2:          01:43:40       Yeah, I've seen it. I just went to like a local circus in the middle of a field. I took my son last week and these people are in that with no wires and shit. Like what the fuck are they doing

Speaker 3:          01:43:51       there? Earn and son.

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       There's about, yeah. What did it get? There's like there's like a hundred of them and it doesn't only like 30 people in the crowd. I'm like, what are these people getting paid? Yeah, they're doing two shows. The next show has like a hundred people going from town to town and they're swinging off these ropes. I'm like, it's a weird middle. Make a living man. But that was like the Carney was like the, there was a classic character in like movies and stories and most people knew about the traveling people that would go from town to town. And these carnival, there's set up carnivals, they're all dangerous and shit and carnies. I mean that's a classic description, right? That's kind of fucked up. And these guys looked at the guys that worked at definitely, they all did, right? Yeah. Even, yeah. Even last week they look creepy. Well, you remember those fucking machines they would set up like we, they had carnivals, Massachusetts.

Speaker 4:          01:44:42       We would go to these local places, you know, they'd be set up seasonally and something like that. And you'd go down there and they'd have fried dough, you know that fried dough with the fucking, the uh, powdered sugar on it. Yeah. What's that called? Watson? No, no. Waffle cakes. Fun. Okay. Funnel cakes. Elephant here. Yeah, there's a, there's a, there's a zip something, a fucking Italian name. Pour it. Dave gamble, you know, or something like that. That's not it, that it starts with a z. But anyway, the point being this fried dough, these stands and these, and then they'd have these ridiculous carousels. Like what kind of an asshole do you have to be? Get on that and risk your life on this fucking contraption that was put together by these guys. You know, what kind of regulations do they had for carnivals back then?

Speaker 4:          01:45:26       Yeah, it does not an inspector coming in every day when they're shutting it off to make sure it's safe. I know little town that they're in. It's just such a weird, like common thing. It's a common thing. I carnivals are common. Everybody knows about carnivals. But to have that kind of a show, go travel from town to town, set up, put up tents, put on little weird shows. Try to get everybody's money and then get the fuck out of dodge. Move onto the next place. All jaded and weird. Yeah, cause every move you make a hit too. For $200 you could sit two rows up and on the doll over here, ride the cab. Me and my son ride the camel for seven bucks a piece. He wrote the [inaudible], we were on a cattle together. He wrote the elephant for nine. That was nine and stuff. Yet they have elephants, that program for two bucks. That's a fucked up thing that the circus animals like the, do you ever see the one with the bear and the monkey where there's a train bear and a monkey and they're riding bikes together? Never seen that. It's pretty funny. Pretty fucked up. The bear, um, crashes into the Monkey. The monkey falls, the bear crashes into them and the bear decides amongst Assholey so kills him in front of everybody.

Speaker 4:          01:46:37       He was in pain and he associated the pain with this monkey fucking up, right? Like he, like, I think he might've thought the monkey attacked him. Like that's why I fell like this. My thought, like the monkey was attacking him. So He, this monkey in front of everybody and they're trying to get them off the monkeys. A fucking giant train. Grizzly bear just like it's so, it's such a, it's such a hilarious video. It's horrible. Right? But it's also hilarious. Like what the fuck is wrong with people? You got to train. Bear and a trained monkey. Look at this. They're riding a bike together. I mean, that is a real fucking bear. Oh Shit. That's a real bear. That, look, this guy falls down, the bare falls. The bear knocks into this guy and so he, he gets back on. Is that it already? Yes.

Speaker 6:          01:47:22       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:47:23       Oh my gosh. I missed it then. I fucked up. I didn't see where the monkey had him.

Speaker 4:          01:47:30       I was too busy laughing. It's just so crazy that people think it's okay to get a bear to write a fucking bicycle with a monkey. So, okay, so there's a monkey in front of them and the bears behind them. Okay. I sit it and see, because the guy got in the way right here. Boom. The guy kind of fucked up and the bear runs over the monkey and just decides to Maul Him. Fuck this biding bikes, socks. I'm a bear. And these guys, they can't do shit about it. They're watching him tear this fucking monkey apart. Nothing they could do.

Speaker 6:          01:48:04       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:48:04       And then they realize like, Jesus Christ, we're working with a bear. You know, you thought of them as Hank, your coworker. This is my buddy Hank. You know? Oh, Hanks a murderer. Thanks a fucking murderer. No, no. He's a good guy. He's a good guy and let's crashes into you with a bike. He just eats you in front of crowds. It reminds me of days, had a famous bet about Siegfried and Roy. He's like, you know, people just bought those tickets every night. Cold tonight. Could be the night that they don't have a one of those anymore. They don't have a CIG Freedom Roy type act anymore. I can't think of one famous thing in Vegas like that. They still have the lines. Apparently at the MGM, the PM GM has lions and the barrage as dolphins. It's kind of fucked. Then they take that exhibit of the line exhibit out of the, I don't know the damn. Yeah, I don't remember seeing it in the day. They took it out. That's good. I went to it a long time ago and I was like, what in the fuck didn't want him to get attacked in there? In front of this. One of the trainers got attacked. Yeah, there's a video of that. I saw that, but the idea that you could have a fucking casino in Vegas.

Speaker 10:         01:49:10       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:49:10       and inside this glass box is these port tigers or lions rather. They are getting tortured and they're looking at these people walking around staring at them. That's way more unnatural than a zoo plus cigarette smoke. Cigarettes drink. Yeah. Gotcha. Screaming. Yeah, of course. Yeah. That's a fucked up place for a lion.

Speaker 4:          01:49:30       Why do people have lions in the back of their Lamborghinis and do Dubai's a, is that a real thing that people do? You're talking about that dude is driving the AMG Mercedes and he has a a a leopard and his front seat. It was a cheetah, I think it was a cheetah actually. Why did they do that? They do that cause did my a tiger. Why did Mike Tyson own those, those crazy animals? There's a documentary on it that's really good. It's called the elephant in the living room, and it's all about people that keep these crazy exotic pets. And this one guy that had lions and the lions lived in a small box cart that chat live Persian Gulf. Ah, Persians, look at him. He's the most gangster. He's hanging out with like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. Scroll up. He's hanging out with the lions and they're covered in blood. What the fuck are they covered in? Blood for the dead animal right there. Oh Jesus. So he would give them that while they killed that thing. So it gave them a calf. They the mall, the calf, and he comes in and sits next to the body and hangs out with them. Oh my God. They gave him a shark to kill.

Speaker 4:          01:50:40       This guy seems awesome. The well, there's always going to be people like this. Whenever there's billions of dollars out there. Look at that. The guys on a Mercedes, an AMG Mercedes, and they standing on the roof, which is an asshole thing to do. And he's feeding his lion who was on the hood of the car and his friends at the driver's seat and it's fed. It's like you've gotta be fucking kidding me, man. This is going to be the best youtube video. This guy's nuts. This seemed like one dude. So is he like training these lines? I think it's just bad ass. I probably fucks them. That's his Instagram account. That's hilarious. He's got money. Look at that fucking one on a top with a, hold on. Go back to that one. Look at that shit. That is so crazy. You got off my car. He's, he's on his knees like on his toes. Bent down like a rapper. Like if he's playing dice or something and right next to him as a lion and he's on a Mercedes, that's gotta be, that's gotta be his dating profile for whatever online services on Tinder or whatever. That's his dating profile. Me. I love nature and Mercedes Benz. He's sucking my Dick. Yeah, that's, Oh, such a ridiculous photo. What does, you know, how's it guy like that live in this world?

Speaker 4:          01:51:58       It's just, I love that. If you're going to have people that are flashy and any way, you're always gonna have that one person takes flashing as to the most fucked up place. So like whenever you have a house that's like the most, the huge, just be like, what was the one that we were looking at the other day that was in Bel Air? That was 50, but that was after the show was over. Right? We out $500 million in Belair and the, the previous most expensive ones sold in Bel Air. It was like a hundred million dollars. Right? What the fuck? Really? Like how come you don't retire? Why do you have a $500 million house? That's ridiculous. So yeah, this guy's good thing that's got a, her pool. So that's what the guy was in Dubai. Yeah. So you get all these Russian checks, European checks go over to Dubai. I tried to find rich guys. Oh yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       yeah. When we were, uh, I was in Abu Dhabi for the UFC and a bunch of the guys went to Dubai just to see what it was like and go get some food and shit. And they said that they walked into a bar that had no idea and it was literally all Russian hookers, the entire bar. They're like, dude, I think this is a hooker bar. Like it was all Russian hookers waiting for guys who show up. And they got there and I say Russian, but you know, Middle East or eastern bloc country type accents. And they were like, I've never seen anything like it. Like there's so much money there apparently that they just, that's just where they go. They know that rich people are coming in to vacation and they have certain spots where they can just find these Russian bronze. Then there's also a bunch that come over from eastern Europe and they just try to find American men and the move to America.

Speaker 1:          01:53:35       Did you ever think about doing that? Absolutely. Okay. A Nice, nice 10 from Siberia. Yeah. I mean I got, I got some bedrooms in my house. Yeah. Come on, stay, stay around, get your green card. I've had friends who bring them back at a hotel like, oh yeah, you know I got two mansions, I live here, I live here and you know, and then bang them and then try to get rid of him after it. They got nothing. Eventually if they keep doing that they'll, they'll find a guy. Oh yeah, absolutely. But the buys really weird. Like that's where you, if you kiss someone in public, I get thrown in jail and stuff like that. So he really got to do, you can't do it in the bar, you can't even do it on the till. You get back to in the hotel room. Well there was caught with Melatonin.

Speaker 1:          01:54:16       She got caught with Melatonin, which is a natural supplement that helps you go to sleep and they locked her in fucking jail. She was an executive at a sound, I think end the mall. Like one of those. I'm one of those production companies and it was another lady or another guy rather that got arrested for having some prescription medication that's illegal there but not illegal in the UK where he lived and so he had some prescription medication then he travels with, but he has to take, his doctor prescribes it and they fucking locked him right in jail. They took his, took his medication away from him and through him in a box yet I was a rapper too going over, cause they do a lot of constant over there. Rapper had some, I think he had some marijuana. I'm just a little, he got thrown in jail.

Speaker 1:          01:54:55       Porto, Carrie Bradshaw. She kissed that guy on the beach and they've got arrested in sex in the city too. I S I did not see that. Is that a movie dead more than one movement? No, I did not. We talked about it. Sex and the city too. Yeah. No, we definitely did not talk about it. I've never seen a city to kiss Mr big on the beach and they can see it. I watched some of the previews. I think we might have mocked it, but we never talked about me seeing it. Oh, I was in, let them talk about it. There was, there was actually a second one. If I saw it, I would talk about it. You liked we you'd like so retarded. I know. You really should go to a doctor. The patch did something. Tell him. Yeah, he's something wrong with your brain. Like half your sentences today are so goofy. That three. That's exactly

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       what you were saying. It's like you're off. I could feel it. Oh yeah, I miss her. It's totally, I feel you're going to make it. No, you're so weak. No, I will make it. She's a man up man up hungry right now. I'm, I don't, I'm not normally Hungary and so it's like weird. I had something that they say like that's a big one with cigarette smokers that the appetite suppressant aspect of it, it's 100% like I never wanted to eat like at one in the after World War Two in the afternoon or whatever and I

Speaker 3:          01:56:12       well you got to replace it with something else. You obviously have an addiction, so you've got to get a new healthy addiction. That's what you gotta do.

Speaker 11:         01:56:18       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:56:18       As start calling it a jam or something, you know?

Speaker 11:         01:56:22       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          01:56:23       Yeah. I'd been drinking Jamba juice lately though. That's good. Fruit juice

Speaker 3:          01:56:26       to start. Yeah. That's not bad. The problem with Jamba juice, not Jamba juice, but like a lot of those places you think you're getting, I'm going to have a smoothie. The amount of sugar that's in those smoothies, it's a lot of divisions. Juice and yeah. Really? When you have an orange, you supposed to eat an orange, like orange juice is kind of an unnatural way to get orange stuff. You know, to have this such a concentrated amount, like when you, you were drinking orange juice, the way that it comes into your body, your body's like, how the fuck did you get this? Like this I talked to was not in the orange. Why are you not chew and fiber? This isn't attached to the pulp and all that other stuff. Like how'd you do this? And you're just pouring it right in your bloodstream. It's just basically like sugar water. It's better for you. Like fresh squeeze, a lot of vitamins in it and stuff, but there's a lot of sugar. A lot of calories and fruit juices. Yeah. Try to fresh juice or mega right there.

Speaker 2:          01:57:16       Don't give him advice for free. He's not gonna. He's not gonna know it. I used to juice. He's already thinking about the cigarette. He's going to have it in his car on the way home. I knew I was going to stop at the gas station and like, fuck it man. It's crashed this mother fucker right into the beach. It's important to when you doing out in La what's going on? Yeah. What are you doing? Did you know the usual meetings? What I tell you? Great. Yeah. We're gonna put you in a movie and we've got a part for you and Adam Sandler. I'll probably call you tomorrow at home and then you never hear from again. You know one of those sometimes those pan out. Yeah, once in a while. I do actually. So that's what you're out here and I do some standup shows. I think you're going to do a show together at the comedy store and Brian, you're doing that show to right. And Joey has just got added to it. GDS, Delray says

Speaker 3:          01:58:05       belly room show to folks. So uh, don't sleep. It's the only seats like 70 people. It's only supposed to see 70 people I already sold out. Yeah, it probably is, but it's a, they really jam like 90 in that right? We think somewhere in there, somewhere on there. Maybe the fire marshal doesn't know. Apparently supposed to get 57

Speaker 2:          01:58:23       57. I loved that. Roam the belly room markets the best. I got to go there tonight and check to make sure the sound system is still there cause I wasn't working last night. I think they might've blown her new speakers up there. Oh No. So anybody can use it, right? People that unfortunately, yeah, there's not a sound guy up in there. It's kind of like I said, most comedy clubs you usually a sound guy that takes

Speaker 1:          01:58:41       care of, of the sound board and everything and the belly room. It's kind of like whoever's running the show kind of takes over the sound word, which is a horrible idea. But so you guys put in a new sound board? Yeah. Kill Tony. The one episode you can just raise money. No idea. It was a, that was a standup show or I did death squad showed up, put all the money towards it and then the comedy store matched it. So we got it like our really high end sound system up there and some of them might have blown it. Maybe on, I'll find out tonight or this weekend too. I'm there Friday and Saturday. I'm doing the belly room. Yeah. We have killed Tony Tonight there. So I get to put a new sound board on your Amazon gift, a gift shop or whatever the hell it is. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:59:21       So uh, you don't start before, right? Yeah. What do you do mostly in New York, which uh, which clubs do you work at? Does a new club called the stand? You'll keep hearing good things about that for a club. Yeah. Ari does that place a lot? Yeah, it's, yeah, it's similar to the comedy cellar downstairs in our basement. Upstairs you're hang the comex. Great food. Um, I did add, you know, in the comedy cellar, standup New York, still the good road gigs around. They're still not really not in that area. His governor still around. Governors is still there. It's a great gig. That's a great gig brokerage. The Braemar brokerage is still the isle. I used to have a hard time getting booked there cause I was dirty. So I worked at one time and the guy hated me. The guy who originally owned it and I never went back after that.

Speaker 1:          02:00:02       The governor, they didn't care. No. Devin is it like, they just wanted you to be funny, but, uh, the brokerage, they wanted it squeaky clean. 1970s Johnny Carson style. This is a bunch of those clubs. Well, that's comedy Magic Club. Joey Diaz still can't work the comedy and Magic Club. They won't, they, they had to have a conversation with me about Joey because Joey was my opening act. You know, I always brought Joey with me as much as I can. And, uh, comedy Magic Club. We're like, we have to talk to you about this. It's like, well, isn't that weird though, that they let Ari shift fear? He's not as dirty as Joey. He used to be pretty fucking dirty. I remember the weekend that that's a different level. It's a different level with Joey's doing the pigeon, you know you're doing that eating a monkey from behind. You're sticking your nose right now, asshole.

Speaker 1:          02:00:48       Like a page. And I think it goes like this. He goes, that's a chicken, but what the fuck? You know what I'm talking about the pigeon? Yeah. He was just doing some crazy ass eating stuff and uh, Mike is like, that's it. Because that was also back before, like there was, the shows would be packed, but half the people would know me from like maybe fear factor. And he had a bunch of regulars that would go there every Sunday no matter what, every weekend, no matter what. He's got a bunch of like regulars and he, he always has his squeaky clean shells. So they would come to see me and they'd have no idea what the fuck was about to hit them. And Julie would get onstage and a bunch of, I'm like barely, barely made it through, almost had heart attacks, ran out into the fucking street.

Speaker 1:          02:01:33       What did you do to me? They're used to like the 9:00 AM uh, Jay Leno show on Sunday, you know, not, not really 9:00 AM, but it might as well be, you know, he would do these a tonight show monologue says he we're working on on Sunday. So yeah. And he'd go down there and just read a bunch of like very non offensive, very mild tonight show style jokes. So they got used to that. And then Joey Diaz just hits the stage like fucking tornado. They just didn't know what to do. So half of them loved it, but it was a good percent. But now if we went back it would be 100% they would know what the fuck to expect that it would be awesome. But he's scared. Yeah. I liked that, that club once and I was a tonight show, people coming to see me and they were gave me a warning and they go, look, I don't know why you're going to do up here.

Speaker 1:          02:02:18       I go, I'm doing it tonight. Show side. Yeah, it's four and a half minutes. I can't do any dirty shit on the tonight show. It's going to be fine. Like, all right, we'll just, just make sure you know we don't, we know you've got a reputation from these codes from Howard stern and all this stuff and how gross. I know I'm auditioning for it tonight show. I'm not going to talk about ass eating. You'd have to really say it in a way that it could get on. What year was this? This was probably like eight years ago, seven years ago. They have lighter standards now, like standards and practices that you can get away with a lot of shit now that you'd never could get away with just a few years ago. Like the Internet is opening up the boundaries for what? Like just look at the, the Gore factor.

Speaker 1:          02:02:57       Look at like I was watching CSI and the other day and they had some bodies that they were like picking bullets out of or some shit and I was like, whoa. Like I can't believe this is regular TV. Like really fucking gory. They show it to you like really quick. You know, like they don't show you like long focused shots, but it's enough that you're like, Whoa, I can't believe this is regular TV. Do you think the fear factor episode with the Com would be able to be passed nowadays? No. Kent maybe be drink Tom, someone's son, someone's son, someone's daughter. You're making them drink. Come on TV. Every watched that. The other day, one of the grossest things I've ever heard someone trying, oh, they'd drink a big gulp full of cum, big drink like 24 hours, 24 ounces rather. It was honest. It didn't make the shell, no, never, never got in the year in America, but it made the air and like Holland and a bunch of other cities, so they took a bunch of the countries.

Speaker 1:          02:03:50       So they took the video of that and they upload it to youtube. You could watch it. It's available. It was the most ridiculous. A shy girl drank guy, one guy and two girls. I said Craig, did you see that new fear factor of rip off Sir that's starting heard about it? Yeah, it's pretty, pretty close. Good. They even advertise it in the commercial like juice, like fear factor, bullseye or whatever. Really they say just like fear factor. Wow. That's hilarious. Yeah man, that was a show with, that was one of the rare times in life where uh, someone got fired because someone drank come on TV. Cause that was, that was what happened. We all got fired because someone drank come on TV and I was happy. I was like, good. It's canceled. Like I was literally happy that it was cancerous. Why to show got canceled. The other ratings were really good. It was doing really well when it came back,

Speaker 3:          02:04:37       the, the stunts were insane, but the stunts were getting fucking hairy. Like we had a couple, like pretty pretty big accidents. There was one where this couple left, like the um, the driver or something happened and his windshield was obscured with like a cardboard box and they almost crashed into this lady's leg. Like it was, it was enough that I was like, Whoa, like you guys are taking some fucking chances here. Like there was always a certain amount of chance in fear factor, but they were taking some trances that I was like, what happens if this goes wrong? Like one of them was you were attached to a Bungee cord that was attached to a helicopter and you had to, that your partner had to unlock you. So there's a like a chain full of keys and then there's a lock and so you have to find the right lock.

Speaker 3:          02:05:22       So it's you and you're competing with someone else and there's helicopters and the helicopter has a hold of you on a Bungee cord. I pulled tight and then so when they let go, when they unlock you, they let go and you go shooting off into fucking space shit. And I'm saying like they were falling through the air full, flying through the air. On the most crazy bungee cord you've ever seen you in life and it's attached to a fucking helicopter. So you watching this, you're like, what if the helicopter crashes? Like has anybody done this? Like how many dry runs if you'd done with this right? Like you know the stunt guys, they don't even get paid and they would have to recreate this fucking thing and a lot of times they would recreate it with PA's. They'd get a PA to do the stunt and they would pay him like 100 bucks and then they would attach them to this fucking thing and the launched him into into space or shit, how's he sung?

Speaker 3:          02:06:14       That's going to die. You can't, there's no way you can prevent, like you can't stop anything if it goes wrong. There's no fee. Like if that Bungee cord snaps, you're dead. Okay. If the helicopter crashes, everyone's dead. And they did it off a canyon. Like there's like this like huge cliff and the tree was attached to the people and the edge of this cliff. Oh, this is it right here. Yeah. Somebody who's running the, the fear factor Facebook page. And making all these look, look at this shit. Shit. Backed that up a second. So just, you can see how retarded that is. Watched it. She gets the key in. She unlocks it. And the moment she does, as soon as she gets free, he pulls the I'm fucking thing. Look at that thing. She got shot through the fucking air on the bottom of a helicopter.

Speaker 3:          02:07:04       So ridiculous. That Lady Shave your head to that was, that was more disturbing for people than anything else. He made that lady shave her hair. She shaved her head. Didn't you make somebody get a tattoo also? No, they did. They wouldn't do it. They quit. They did. They had to get a fear factor tattoo and the Tattoo of me really? Yup. And that, that got approved by NBC, which is ridiculous. And as they wanted to do at the bottom of their feet, but can't do it because of um, uh, sanity, you know, hygiene reasons. When you step on, if you have a sore

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       like that at the bottom of your foot at risks, pretty severe infection possibilities. But, um, they did that, that, that NBC said they could have the tattoo. And the other thing that NBC said was that they could drink piss. They drank piss too. They drank donkey pis and donkey come or was cow piss and donkey Kong. Yeah. Yeah. That was real calm. Was that in their donkey come who's real calm? Like, oh, the producers and the line, everybody's, everybody on the street. We just pull over and ask people to jerk it off. It was so ridiculous. It was such as huge vat of calm that they had to, they would pour into these glasses. And here's the thing, like your best case scenario in this game, the best you could do, you would have to drink five ounces. Absolutely. Absolutely have to drink five ounces because they're playing horseshoes.

Speaker 4:          02:08:23       So if you fucking got a ringer, you nailed it. You didn't, it's not even, you know, like if you nail it, you don't have to drink now. Even if you nail it, you have to drink five ounces. Just crazy. Was it refrigerated or was it like water temperature now you'd have to refrigerate it. Didn't want to serve that shield. Yeah. That's how I feel. At least you could pretend it's something else. If it's hot, it's going down. You throw it, you know exactly what it is. They get a latte. No little hot latte. That's bad. I don't know what you're putting in your locked eyes. What do you need to stop right now or are you going to get pregnant? It's just like the Kelly. You want to chill. That's a lot easier going down. Chill. It's all psychological though cause it's like it's come right.

Speaker 4:          02:09:00       It's salty liquid like not like when you swallow snot. It's all psychological, but the actual taste of Snot, it's not the worst thing in the world. You know? I'm sure there's a lot of things to taste way better than way worse than snot or com. But a check that swallows got a big advantage. He's like girl saying that the girls, it was hilarious. They were like, I'll take the comp. The girl took the calm over the pissed. I go, really? She goes, yeah, what's the big deal? I was like, wow, what a trooper. You know, like she took the come, she's like, it'd be easier. I've swallowed come before. We didn't have any of that on TV obviously, but they were laughing about it. You're like, I've swallowed before, this will be easy. Fine. And I was like, wow. Like I guess a guy would probably like if there was some sort of a squirting thing that pigs did and you could collect that and a guy had to choose between, uh, drinking that stuff or a, or something else, you would go with the squirty stuff. Cause it's like, it's coming out of a girl's vagina. It's just, just like, girl come, no big deal. What was it? The girl. But I think that's how the girls looked at it when they thought about this. The idea.

Speaker 4:          02:10:06       Yeah, that's common dude. Oh my God. They drank a mug. You girls are awesome. Like I was plugging in. They're plugging their nose while they're drinking. Come look at that guy, chuck. Come,

Speaker 3:          02:10:37       that guy just chugged. Come. Oh my goodness. Okay. Well how has that fear, so fear factors released that then? Oh No, no. If it's edited, it's fear factor moments. Yeah, it's, it's something happened about six months ago. Fear factors. Facebook page just started posting brand new videos and like you advertisements and stuff. He goes to shit that come out. I love how Joe's right in her face. Come on, fucking do it already. A trooper. I still to this day I'll go back and I watched this and I can't believe it really happened. Didn't you have a guy named Brian that tested everything before that they had to test it? No, there was a bunch of guys. But Josh, Josh Silverman, he was the, well, he was the beast done. Um, producer. He produced it. He had done a bunch of different crazy shows. He's out. He actually had been on a reality show.

Speaker 3:          02:11:27       He's on Ted Nugent's reality show at one point in time as a contestant. Rarely, but that guy was nuts and he was [inaudible]. He was getting dark. Like his mind was getting very dark from all of the, uh, coming up with the different stunts for these people. Like figuring out different ways to get people to fucking pull, uh, like bison hearts out of a swimming pool filled with blood. Like they kept coming up with more and more fucked up things and I was like, this is gotta be bad for your brain. Like to ha like this is your job. And he was like, totally. It's definitely, it's not good. Yeah. It was like this not, it's not good to think about this kind of stuff all the time. That's why they came up with this drinking come thing I think. I think they got so lost, they didn't realize like how insane this is going to be to the rest of the world.

Speaker 3:          02:12:10       Like they were like, look gay. They gave us the green light. Let's do it. We're gonna push the envelope. It was pushed you off. All right, we're going to do lunch on Tuesday and like the network and the executive would high five each other. They, they're so out of touch. They had no idea that the rest of the world was going to go. You make people drink, come on TV, even drinking piss. Like they just making people drink. Pisses is probably enough to get the show canceled, but the fact that there was pissed and come together, the network is like, what did we do? What happened here? They should bring it back but put on Netflix friends censored and make it like the grossest of gross. Well, I'm not doing it. I'm done. Like eating yeast infection. I'll never do it again. A kit we can you see a yeast infection would have totally creamy.

Speaker 3:          02:12:47       Oh No, it's cream. It goes to the same in Grecian comes out, he's scooping, scooping it up like it's like he's making pizza or I've had this hurricane doe chunky. You've had a curdled. I mean I've put on my deck and it's been like chunks of white east all over it. Yeah, that's not good. Again, the quality of the company that you keep out as reflected in many shitty decisions that you've made in this crazy life. What's wrong with you? Boy, she had diabetes, she had diabetes and that affects your vagina. Oh yeah. You get yeast infections all day. That makes sense. I guess your whole body is out of whack. They say a lot of, um, lot of issues that people have with various bacteria levels and things like that. You could be mitigated with just probiotics that people took probiotics, all the, it'd be less

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       ease. Infections, like a lot of less, lot less, uh, bacterial issues. Yeah. A lot of aloe drink an ally. Do you, uh, do you eat healthy Jim Florentine probiotics every day? You look healthy as, fuck, I just lost 25 pounds. Did you? Yeah. What'd you do? Why not juice fast? Well, I got a divorce so that, that helps. That helps. Yeah. 13 days. No food. Comics with the divorces, that's rare. Usually it works out and it dies. I know. It's like when a comics happily married, he goes, you okay, what's wrong with him? Is he all right on that for dicey is still fun. Just came to my wedding and he goes, first of all, he goes, look, he goes, I look at all your friends here. He goes to roll a bunch of fucking creeps. I don't know where they've come by, where these people work.

Speaker 1:          02:14:20       He goes here, take us. He just handed me a wad of cash. He goes, I'm not even going to leave an envelope because somebody is gonna steal it. Put this in your pocket now and that he wishes. He goes, look, you're wife's lovely and this is a great day for you guys, but just know one day she's going to hate your guts. So he was right. Did they think, did I, you're a wild man. You're always doing stand up. You keep crazy friends. Did you date girls and think they could change you? Is it one of those things where like he's a smart guy, he's really nice. I just think that if I just get a hold of we, you know, we'll work it out now because I always want to have to the crazy ones. I never went after a normal one. It probably showed of that party might.

Speaker 1:          02:15:02       Nah, I mean, you know, no, I didn't always like that. The wild ones. So they weren't looking to tame anybody. How do you find a normal person? Yeah. You can't even find a normal personality. Normal people are not going to find you, first of all, where are you going? You're going to the comedy store, you're going to a bar. It's just hanging out at, at apple on weekends off, you know they work nine to five and you're working weekends. You never get to see, um, that's when they want to hang with their friends and go to like fucking Applebee's or some shit. The all around as a comic, your hours are so fucked and your lifestyle so crazy that unless the girl is living some sort of a crazy life of her own, she's not going to understand like a stripper. That's why they have the same hours.

Speaker 1:          02:15:40       Exactly. Well a lot of comics went up, Danes, strippers for a bunch of reasons, but that's a big one of them is just that some girls like you're out every night. Like I've had friends that I've lost. Like they don't do standup anymore because their wife could upset. They were out two months doing stand up and if you gotta if you're gonna be a good comic, you have to work a lot. You have to work every week. You have to, I mean, you might be able to take weeks off here and there, but essentially you're working several days a week, every week and you're doing it at night and you've got a right and you've got to work on new shit and you've got to constantly be in that zone and you've got to go to the clubs. He got to, you have to, if you don't do it, you're not going to develop material. Yeah. So if you're dating someone, they're like, why do you, I don't understand. You're not even getting paid for this. You're getting like $15 like fuck, that is not, no, I'm working like, where do you think these jokes come from? They don't come from the fucking choke fairy. Like these bitches need to grow. I've got to go water. The, you know, that's,

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       that's what you do. You go to the comedy store on a Tuesday night, you're watering the garden. So the fuck you're doing. Yeah. A lot of people can't get that concept working for food or just not working at all during the week though. Sets they want to hang out, watch a movie. It's Tuesday night TV show and they're like, you're going to go out there for free. How many people are going to be at for people? Is that worth it? They don't get it. Those conversations we used to be so frustrating to me but I get it. I get it in from the girls' point of view, you know she wants a normal life. People want a normal life. They want someone who's going to be home on no normal daytime hours that I want some guys calling them from, from the road cause he did ecstasy.

Speaker 2:          02:17:12       They want shit to be normal. I get it. But strippers don't. So like if you're, unless she really wants to settle down and be normal and she's just, she's in the last days of stripping like this is it. I'm almost 30 I'm so tired of this. It's such bullshit. He's roped me in one of those problem. But you got a wild 24 year old, Jesus, forget it and it, yeah. Jesus Christ, him flying team. So that's why I think cam girls is the way they future. Cause when you're out at the comedy club they could be squirting and at home, you know, and then you just have like a, you're still committed to that score and thing. Um, it is p unproven. No, it's been proven scientifically that it's p they have actual studies now, Tony Hinchcliffe makes fun of you in his act actually wrong. It's completely wrong because scientists, Brian's here, ladies and gentlemen, you get all the retarded shit.

Speaker 2:          02:18:01       He said during the past two hours. Want to clear things up. Now there's intelligence when the knowledge of squirting, when vice did the article about squirting being p, there's a lot of people did an article. It's the same base thing that even when we had, what's his face in here the other day, he even goes, no, I get what you're saying there. It's two different kinds of, have you ever had sex with a girl and after you're done, there's a mungus water like spot on your, on your blanket. Yeah. Right. That's squirting. That's gushing. It's, that's what I'm talking about. What, what those reports are talking about when it's shooting out, projecting. That's p that's obviously P it's coming out of the pee hole, but gushing, gushing is what I'm talking about and get some girls. Some girls you can hit a certain part of their g spot and you'll feel like a flood come out and that is not p and even Dr drew says it.

Speaker 2:          02:18:48       A lot of people even say after drew says abductors, you're also says pot is addictive. He said that a long time ago. Albums you let them go now because you're on his side. When it comes to squirting, I think what it is, he used to be anti Dr drew when it came to weed, but according to him is more important than we'd squirting is his big foot. He will fucking argue with you if you tell him scoring out. Real squirting is the loch ness monster. Squirting is his UFO. Who thinks squirting is cheesy, but I can't make girl squirt. Yeah, dude, you can't do it. No. You know, I mean, I know how to get them to drink a gallon of water and piss all over you. You can feel it. It's like when Jesus touches me, I can't describe it bro. I just feel it. You'd saying every girl can squirt like you can make any girls. Most girls can square it. I think they drink a lot of water. Hold it in. Wait for Brian to finger on price.

Speaker 2:          02:19:42       It's what I'm saying is real, but the UFO fanatic, it's, it's, I think most guys I've had that experience when you're with a girl and you're like, Holy Shit, you were really wet this time and you look down, there's a huge wet spot. That's what I'm talking about. Well yeah. Girls have vaginal, vaginal rather. Lubrication comes out of their body sometimes, but it doesn't ever score it out. It doesn't our score it out like on the video, but girls are going like this is fucking pissing all over the camera. Right. That's, that's the problem. That's, that's, that's p obviously you like a slippery politician have changed your stance. No, I've never changed to say that the spray was a different type. I've never said it was different than urine. I've never said that. Well, the core basic, when you see something squared, I got girls pee hole.

Speaker 2:          02:20:27       It's a last podcast where squirting was discussed and Brian angrily yet again defended the art of scoring. I've always said the exact factors of squirting. No, you definitely said recording. He's real and now you're saying gushing term. What you guys are calling it squirting is in the business. You know a lot of you like fucking pedestrians. You have your terms. I know your terms cording and as pros we were first two is gushing. It's gushing. Yeah, she was a gusher. Right, and that's what, and that's what, what's confusing, what people think squirting is fake and stuff. The people are confused. A lot of things. When you have sex with a girl, sometimes it's a little wet, right? But there's sometimes where you could have, you could feel it just pouring out of her and it won't stop and she's all over the place. She's going to be like the wicked witch of the West and Maltin you were to take all that juice, throw it in a test tube that's not p.

Speaker 2:          02:21:21       Okay, decides this is Brian. What if she go perform these tests? They, I've heard many people talk about it, including documentary, talking about bring up some fun, some facts doctor drew about squirting. Go Google that. I don't need to already know about this a million times to calm then, Huh? Yeah. It's a mixture of, no it's not. But the scientists that have studied it say it's p sorry, but how do you know I can use a computer? I just know I don't need no fancy science. I don't have a companion friend Jesus in my heart. What would you mind if it was pay it and that's it. And that's another thing and that's another thing is the story of this whole conversation. And that's another thing because I've actually had a girl, gosh or squirt or whatever while I was eating her out before and I grew up in your mouth. It did not taste like p because he knows he's drinking a lot of P's. Basically. The piece or Malia it was, it was a mixture. It was a measure that is his, I mean, cosmo Martinis, the girls come is usually has a hints of pee in it, but it's not, it's not urine. Okay. And what about Oak Tannins? All the stuff that they find from those aged barrels.

Speaker 2:          02:22:40       It gets bad. I'm not getting mad. It's just like, dude, definitely get upset when it comes to the topic of squirting. You defend it. Like it's a religious thing because people are so confused about it. Super confused. It's a matter of fact is they're giving a lot of university level courses on it because there's so much confusion about whether or not scoring is p no. When you see it, what you see him in porn is usually a water that's been put up there or urine like you said. But that's not what I'm fucking talking about. I'm talking about there's ways that you can hit the g spot with your Dick and make the girl. Gosh. Um, I dunno. I don't think too many people bother. I didn't even, they didn't squirt even a little in the old point. What are they doing differently? Do they not know what they're doing back then?

Speaker 2:          02:23:19       Ron, Jeremy, Ron. Jeremy didn't know how to lay some dick out. No, that's fake. That's what I'm saying is fake. What are you talking about? I'm saying that the stuff that you see in porn that you guys think is squirting is water that has the guys you dummies. That's like you so called Christians. He's like a religious fanatic over there. I don't think most people care. You know, like yeah, you could go, you know at district squirt it last night. Like that's actually pay like Oh really? And that's it. Oh I know what that it was at my mouth. All right, well whatever I drank pay, I'll call that a collection. Some Gosh, you didn't need it to the rubber gloves. You got to need a chain of command, chain of custody. You got to scrape it up. You have to guide there in a sealed envelope. Take it to the lab. I don't know what the fuck you're gonna do with it on the way to the airport. Hopefully she doesn't have a yeast infection at the same time cause that's what it makes sense with the studies. Frothy. Gosh,

Speaker 6:          02:24:14       okay.

Speaker 2:          02:24:14       Definitely need to go back to smoking. Cigarettes will tell you that. Why? Because your brain, what happened over the last few days. It's shocking. But what I've been saying right now, it's so accurate and the fact that you were actually defending squirting the fact that I could troll you so hard that I could just, it's just all I have to say, it's squirting as p and you will go into a fucking frothy panic.

Speaker 6:          02:24:38       Okay. Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:24:41       No, I'm not getting into a panic. I just said people defensive. It's a, it's an annoying when people go to knowing when people on Twitter, my Jesus squirting, it's not real. And like it's like, all right, well guess what? The expired that's coming your way today, Fella. I know. What's your Twitter handle? Red Band. [inaudible] I gotta give you a lot of fucking medical studies on pice. Various properties of pissed. It's gushing. Guys. Guys don't even know. She's such amateurs. You don't even know how to make a girl Gush.

Speaker 6:          02:25:09       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:25:09       So you can make every girl, not every girl, but I couldn't make a lot of lives because of the shape of my Dick and like a certain way. What's wrong with it? It's pointed towards my debt, my face. So it's kind of like bent towards my face and a, if you put your like a his legs up between your shoulder and make

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       me throw up this podcast. We're about to end soon. So you've got to put it over your legs. Yeah, usually over your shoulders. Relax over. Yeah. And it's got a band up. Well, I don't know if it has to bend up, but I'm just saying that that's why I think I've had such great success. You should give seminars. I just did. No, you just explained. It should give seminars where you're like, walk around people, tell him, nope, your hips over here like a yoga class. Wait down here or it looks at every guy's deck. Nope, doesn't end up. You got to break your Dick. I could take your money, but you're not going to be able to do it. I know he's a young age. You could just put it underneath your belt buckle and it will grow that way around your belly. So every time you have a bone here, just puts it straight up north.

Speaker 1:          02:26:06       He's 40 grown man. That reminds me of a Brady bunch episode where Bobby, you want it to be taller so he hung from the swing set was arms. Yeah, cause he wanted to be taller. I remember that episode. So that's what, that's what I was pretty, but you're going to stays up. Deli is a natural, the Brady bunch and wasn't real. And he's a real person. You really fucking believe. I really believe it's going to change the shape of your Dick by tucking it in your balls. You know what? I'm wearing a belt right now. I'm going to do around the right, wrap it up, tie it or not. Maybe you get one of those versus Florida. And I'm looking for a squirter.

Speaker 1:          02:26:40       I've had some pretty good squirters. Okay, buddy. All right, let's wrap this up. Belly button. Thanks for showing up. You're the best, Jim Florentine. What's going on, man? Where's the, where's the the, uh, website, uh, what's a clarky.com and it's Mr Jim Florentine on Twitter. This is Jim Florence and a Twitter. I'm going to be at Amy Schumer. No movie coming up in July 17th. It's a moving train wreck. Oh, what is it? It's a comedy. Her a movie with Judd Apatow direct. I just got a little part in it. Beautiful.

And uh, you got any comedy club dates coming up? Just this Wednesday night, Wednesday night comedy store, be at the comedy store and that ball at the Martha.

Jim Florentine and that'll midgets or mental metal? Metal. Metal. Midges yeah, those three things in that order. Yeah. I just, it had a nice ring to it. Dude. I go, I forgot to talk to you about this one. Dude. Ask you off the air, but your friend who uh, lives in Florida, some crazy friend who was listening to your radio show, Gary from Florida. Is it the, the nutty dude? Yeah. Fucks all these girls and has all these ridiculous stories. Fucks him in the ass person. I cook some chicken Marsala and I thought some of the gas you will, you talking to him? Were you talking about him? I don't remember. It was on the radio show, but I was fuck, I sat in my car out here in this parking lot was laughing like a mental patient. I was just with him this past weekend. He's insane. He goes on these dating websites and gets these girls. He, he started

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       when he was 35. He did, he put in from 40 to 65 cause he goes, no one at 35 wants to fuck those women. I will. It's like I'm not going after a 22 year olds. So some 52 year old and Florida single, you know, big tits, divorced, Tan, take about one day. Take a look, just feed me and fuck me was like first night, right? And yes. Whoa. Eight at a 10 times eight out of 10 pain in his pen. Wow. He looks like a bloated Tony, Dan. So I'll let you know. So it works for him. And he and a 35 year old wants to the funk of 52 year old. So he's got that market. That's smart. Yeah. Oh yeah. He's always been like that. Hey, leave a message. I just fucked a 64 year olds. He goes, she, she was, she wanted to be in bed by eight so I'm going back out trying to get another one.

Speaker 2:          02:29:10       Oh my God. That's so bizarre. That's a smart move though. If you want numbers, you want to put up numbers. That's all he cared about was numbers. He's like, look, I got to get a hall of fame numbers. It's all I'm looking for. And these when we get attached to him or they don't care, I want Dick. It's Florida. They don't care. They don't care. Cause Florida. Yeah, Florida. It's a whole other animal down there. They don't give a shit. They moved from one to another to another. Really? Yeah. He might go see him one more time and they don't even bother him after that. Really. Especially an older woman, they're just set in their ways. They're like, look, I just want to get laid. Right. I could get that like they not looking for a man anymore. Now it's come along and tell him what to do.

Speaker 2:          02:29:47       Yeah, they got luck, man. I'm horny. It's been awhile. Wow. A lot of times he what? He tried to do it without even getting dinner. He's like, let me see. He tried to pull that one off. Just meet him for a drink. Right. He is a move was never to go, let's meet at six it was always like eight 30 so he didn't have to buy him dinner. He's like, they're definitely going to eat by then, so he had his strategy. Yeah, Gary, I mean you're banging her in the ass the first night you probably could buy or a dinner. It's worth it. It's worth $150 dinner. Was he because he didn't want to take a chance of being stuck at dinner or was he trying to save money, save money and just be complete dirt bag? That's the only reason cause you'd get stuck in a horrible conversation if you commit to dinner and as you just met this person and like five minutes into the conversation and realize they're fucking crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:30:37       Like, oh no, I'm going to have a meal with this person. Shit. Yeah. Then you just got to find the waiter. I'll be right back. You'll find the waiter give the waiter money and you'd get the fuck out of dodge before they even know what hit him. Just walk out the front door run. Yeah, but what if he drove? I had that problem with that meth head check a couple of weeks ago. Did you drive? If she drove you got a problem. Well then even then you just get an Uber. You live in the new world. It's a new world gym flooring. You don't have to worry about that. Worry about that crap. Well, he would just meet them for a drink and then he figured if it was going to work, hey, let's go back always by his, his house close by within a mile. Hey, let's go back to my place while another one. But if he goes to his place, then he's got to get them out. He gets a day, always want to leave right afterwards. They don't want to stay. Yes. That's

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       hilarious. I know. So there's just different, she had a different animal, different animal than a woman is trying to carve out a relationship like this is maybe Jim Florentine is the one. Maybe I could settle down with Jim Florentine and have some babies instead of that. She's like, nope, nope. I just want some Dick. I'm 50 I just want someone to fuck me in my mouth and then get out of the house.

Speaker 7:          02:31:42       Pretty much. My nephew and my nephew just moved to Florida. He's a 27 I made, he is cleaning up down there cause he used to live. I said, oh you got to put up like Coors field numbers. You know what I mean? Like, of course, field a baseball, a boy, the boy, you know, because of the quality at a balls just fly out of there. The numbers are just skewered. He's almost like he's on roids. I write people up the altitude. I sent people looking back at your baseball card from New Jersey to Florida and he was definitely doing Royce, what was going on in these years because now I live in, in Florida. Okay. Then he wasn't doing roids. Yeah. Florida is the party state. It's insane.

Speaker 3:          02:32:15       It's those Florida man Twitter, uh, notices. Have you ever seen those? No. But Burke Christ page. Yeah. Burt crushed from Florida. But Florida man is a page on Twitter. And if you go to Florida, man, uh, on the Twitter feed, it's all new stories about a guy from Florida doing something retarded. It's, they're just, it's a different part of the world, man. It's completely different part of the world. So if you're a guy who looks like a bloated Tony Danza bloated Tony Danza just cleaning up on the girls who've made these terrible mistakes into the decades pass and now they're just kind of like settled in, settled in, settled in their ways but still get horny

Speaker 7:          02:32:48       in my twenties I moved down there because I want it to get laid. Wow. You moved down there specifically because he wanted to get light moved down and high school. Our family moved down. I lived there for two years and I met a couple of friends and then a couple of years later I went down there just to visit him and I bang like three chicks in a week and I'm like, I didn't even have three under my belt and my whole life and then like six months later I go, you know what? I'm just moving down there. I just do. I can get laid and that's why that was the only thing. No. What do you think it is? Because it's such a transient state cause that's a big part of what Florida is like people from the east coast, it just moved down there. Yeah. Cause you always get that.

Speaker 7:          02:33:19       You get them in that wild phase for a couple of years. Right. Just go, I'm, I want to get away from my family. I just want to go have fun and I want to try it down here. So you get those girls in that phase and then eventually I moved back to wherever they are usually. Yeah. And a lot of like, you know, it's a lot of white, it's a weird stakes. A lot of white trash and this hot chicks in Miami to just rednecks all over. It's a weird super weird state. Yeah. It's a weird state too because for the longest time it was how immigrants coming into the country from Cuba

Speaker 3:          02:33:45       and how they brought drugs in through Miami. So south Florida was just chaos. And then northern Florida is basically Kentucky. Yup. You know, you're, you're basically living in the deep, deep South in northern Florida. The further north you get, the more southern United States you actually get like Florida, like the south of Florida. It doesn't even seem like the south, you know, it's more like some weird fucking offshoot of long island. Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 7:          02:34:11       Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. It's a chair. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:34:14       an island meets the Caribbean or Long Island

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       meets Cuba, you know? That's what it's like. Yeah. It's just like this weird fucking, just people that just had to get the fuck out of dodge and came down. Nobody ass fucking town to do comedy too, but yeah, it was just down there in Miami. Did you stand up? Yeah. Where were you working at this place called the home field comedy club. I guess it used to be an Improv. It's in Kendall. Oh yeah. Yeah. It was a good Rome. I mean it's part of a sports bar. They don't, it's not like, but they got their own back room and stuff where they do comedy holds like 300 people. That's cool. Yeah, it was pretty good. What are you doing over there? Accidental child. What? Why my child? Because you're playing with your phone. What? We're doing a podcast. I'm sorry.

Speaker 1:          02:34:59       Spell it out now. It's just putting in Wednesday show at the comedy store in my calendar. Oh, thank you. Um, do you like, do you still go back to, uh, where you grew up? Do you do any standup where you, uh, where'd you grow up? I grew up in Jersey. Do you do stand up like near the area where you grew up? Distress. You know what a stress factor in New Brunswick. It's a comedy club. That's kind of where I started it. That's a great spot. Yeah. New Brunswick's great too because it's a cool town. Cool town right next to Rutgers. You know, I just filmed a comedy special air a few months back at winii brands please. Oh, George Street playhouse. It's a theater off for like a 400 seat theater. Oh, cool. I just did it there. That's a good place to do it. Yeah. I couldn't do it at Vinnie's place.

Speaker 1:          02:35:39       It was to me. I didn't want the comedy club field. I want to more like a theater field for it. Yeah. I started doing my last one I did in a comedy club and I think I'm going to do them in the comedy club from now on. I think that doing them in the theater, you just don't, you lose, you lose something and then a large, large stage and I feel like people at home, you're watching, you're in the living room, you know it's an intimate spot like you, you, I think you could relate more to someone on stage in front of like a couple hundred people. Then you know, maybe a thousand or so. I think that the model was to get it sold to a Netflix or showtime and Hbo. They want it to look big, but now you can do it all on your own. It doesn't matter as long as it's good.

Speaker 1:          02:36:16       I don't think it matters. I'm also thinking from now on, but it doesn't matter about like edits and shit like that. I think you should have one camera, one camera that's like the center of the room above the crowd catches like the first couple rows of the crowd in you and that's it. Nothing moving around. Just one clear shot of what you're doing. Just like watching it in a comedy club because I think that all is like cutting it from the side and all this fancy shit they're doing with editing. It doesn't exist. When you go to see a comedy show and when you go to see a comedy show, like it's the funniest thing you've ever seen in your life as a comic onstage killing in a comedy club. You're in the back of the room and he just watching and laughing and you're just looking right at it.

Speaker 1:          02:36:54       There's no crazy angles. There's no weird cuts. There's no shot to the audience laughing. All that stuff's unnatural. Yeah. Yeah. Mine, I only had like the first two rows. I said go to him maybe two or three times the whole show. That's it. I wanted a dog. Yeah, they want it to, I'm like, I don't want, I don't need that. If they can hear the laughs and you know what people at home Nell, if they want to laugh or not, I don't need a laugh truck. If you'd like to light up that audience, they light up the audience. And that's weird because everybody gets like self conscious. Yeah. That's always the worst. This is a weird style that they have of doing these uh, comedy specials. They have this setup at the Irvine Improv. If you'd done that place yet. The new place. No, I haven't done that.

Speaker 1:          02:37:33       No one fucking amazing. I was just there last weekend. They have it set up for a comedy special. So when you're in the green room, if you're watching, you can watch on TV, just the camera they have, you're like, Holy Shit. That's perfect. That's all you need. Like the one camera they have that catches the entire stage that you're on. Like the camera could follow you, they can move it a little bit if you go left or right. And it's all you need. It's really, it's set up perfect. Yeah, I mean it seems like, you know, the comedy specials used to cost like a quarter million to shoot. That was basically the number you needed to raise or whatever. Now you can do it for fucking 15 grand, 10 grand. And I look in, look amazing. It's in the last like three or four years. What changed? Did the cameras and just, you know, you don't have to run out the, the biggest theater or somewhere, the well turn or wherever, you know where it's going to cost a ton of money and hire a real big crow and all that stuff and have seven different cameras.

Speaker 1:          02:38:21       I think you could do it. Everything's getting cheaper and cheaper. Yeah. Hinchcliffe did his entire show. They did it with one shot. One camera follows him into the club, falls and onstage pans, pans of him on stage. Just the whole thing was shot with one camera. Do you remember when I used to go on the road with you and I would have the two cameras on the sides and one camera in the middle and then I would just have a camera that would walk around and do zoom ins and that right there, it was a whole special, a comedy special. That's all you need really. I think they over engineer those fucking things. They really do. They will have a boom mics. I've seen people that boom, they scan the entire crowd and get up to the stage like, well, what are you doing that just takes away from what this guy's talking about?

Speaker 6:          02:39:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:39:02       Yeah. Next one I'm going to do on a comedy club.

Speaker 1:          02:39:06       I want to, yeah, a small little theater like you know, little space maybe in New York, 200 seats, something like that. Yeah. I think that's the future. Like Louis C K did his thing at the comedy store. He did his last one, uh, in the main room. That was great. That's kind of a big room to the main rooms. Kind of big because it's got like a high ceiling. That's a very unusual club in the sense that it's, it seems a lot bigger than it really is. It's only like 300 people, right? Yeah. 300, three 50 I think if they pack it in there, but it seems less intimate than a lot of rooms that are that size. Like there's a lot of comedy clubs that have 300 people that seem like way more packed in. That's such an old school show room, you know with the big giant stage and everything. The lights. Yeah, that's a, that's like as old school as it gets that place. But yeah, the those doing those, like you, you feel like you're there, you know, doing something at the store or doing something in the ice house, you feel like you're there. If you're watching the guy on stage and Madison Square Garden, if you know you can enjoy it but you don't really, I don't think he ever really feel like you're there. I think Kevin Hart's going to do, he's doing a, I have financial is where the eagles

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       play a stadium. She's Christ and I think that's going to be us next special. Oh isn't he doing like sixty thousand sixty thousand people? That's insane. Well he has a crazy show though. He doesn't do just stand up. He has like explosions. He has pyrotechnics. Like he hits punchlines and the fire goes off behind him and shit. He has a like a screen that changes behind him. Like he'll start talking about a place where he was at and then they'll see the screen behind him will be of that place. Really? Yeah. It's a pretty sophisticated set up. Apparently he has like a whole like group of employees. They like our road team that have to set up a stage. Like that's not a small production, that's a fucking major league production when he's doing so. He's like the kiss of a yeah, for sure. Well he is definitely, no one has ever sold more tickets than that guy.

Speaker 4:          02:40:59       No. In comedy, that guy sold out the Boston Garden two nights, two shows in a Sunday night on a Sunday night. I believe it was Sunday, I'm pretty sure. But either way, two shows in a night at the Boston Garden. That's fucking crazy. That's like, that's like 30,000 people. I mean, I've never heard of anybody doing that. He's probably used to be probably it was dice and then it was Dane Cook and I think Kevin Hart has eclipsed pulled of them 60,000 people at financial field. But I heard that Larry the cable guy does numbers like that in the south that he did a Josh Wolfe opened up for him. It took a photo of the audience who was at a football stadium and Josh Wolf's onstage and he's taking a Selfie of this 50,000 fucking people behind them. It's nuts. He said that, uh, he'll, he'll do like football stadiums. Yeah, I could see that.

Speaker 4:          02:41:48       Yeah. I mean he was like, uh, I guess right before Dana and them and Dan came, it kind of took the torch from him. Bob, I mean, um, and then Ross Russell as another Russell Peters, he kills it outside of the country. But I don't think there's a place in America where you could do that. It's like 50,000. He's does twine like he's done Barclay Center in Brooklyn. He sold that out 20,000. He's done the garden before but not, he can't do it. I don't know if he does two or three nights, but he's selling a lot of tickets. Disease did two shows at the garden in one night. The garden is such a crazy place for standup because you think about the garden, you think about like great heavyweight title fights and Shit like that. You know someone to be on stage the garden telling jokes. Billy Joel's got the craziest Gig.

Speaker 4:          02:42:28       He goes to the garden once a month, once a month. That's what he does. Drives in, probably drives a motorcycle. That crazy fuck. Drive down to the garden, gets onstage, kills it. Has All these, the all the old women that your friend flux in Florida, they all fly up for that. A little late. I, they're probably going off over themselves. What are you doing over there Brian? How can we not? I was trying to think of Steve Martin didn't, he used to sell out like arenas. He did big places for sure. I just, before he quit, before he quit, he did some large places, but he had that point. We've talked about this a bunch of times on the podcast where he hit that point where he didn't know what was funny anymore because people laughed at anything he did. Yeah, he was Steve Martin. You get out there and they were just so happy to see him. They Start Patton. Oswald has a fucking

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       hilarious bit about, remember I told you about that casino I did, north of Seattle and I got there. It was like the most drunk audience I've ever performed for it in my fucking life. I mean, never had more people hackle like at a big casino and they're spending a lot of money. It was nuts. Simply it's called tweel lip and a, I was in my car to you, lip to you lip. I was in my car just randomly. Uh, I have a Patton Oswald's new comedy CD on my phone and so randomly it was playing all these different things and the thing it play, like play a song, they don't play someone's bit. I just put it on random and it played Patton Oswald's bit about going to that fucking very same casino. I didn't even know he had a bid on it. It's hilarious because I'm like, this is, this is the place I could relate on such a level because I had fucking just work there.

Speaker 3:          02:44:00       They pay a shitload of money to me. It's ridiculous how much money they pay. And even my, wow, this is crazy. They didn't paint a lot of money and it's like an hour outside of new of Seattle. So you drive an hour from Seattle and then you get there and once the show starts you realize exactly why they're paying you so much. They're like, nobody wants to work here like this. They have to pay you a lot of money to get you to deal with this crowd. Maniacs, the drunk, his fucking people I've ever performed for, but there was great. Just fire now. Oh yeah, a lot of heckling. Yeah. I barely got bits out. I think I made it. I did an hour plus on stage, maybe an hour and 10 a mighty got two bits out. Maybe three, maybe two who opened for Tony? Tony opened. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:44:37       How did he do? Did he did? He did well, it was two one was it Tony who was a Thompson girl? I'm trying to not, I'm pretty sure Tony. Yeah, he did great. Tony's funny, you know, he's got good jokes to Tony's. Like, you know, he, he knows how to like, well that's it's [inaudible] to the heckler. Oh yeah. For sure. If someone was hacking on, but uh, they were good. They were just really fucking hammered. I just think that a, a lot of those people that live out there, there's not a lot to do. They just get fucked. Oh yeah. I got her to casino get messed up. Yeah. That outside of Seattle area is very different than the Seattle area. Like people look at Washington state, they go, oh yeah, Seattle, well sorta go an hour outside of Seattle, Seattle. And you've got that place where that Enim claw, where they're going to get fucked to death by the horse.

Speaker 3:          02:45:21       Yeah. Well they used to have no laws on whether or not people can have sex with animals. So people flock to there and moved in and it started farms and filmed them fucking animals and having animals. Fuck that. Like that's, that's an hour outside of Seattle. Don't get it twisted. Washington state to crazy place. It's got a lot of great spots in it, but it's a crazy place. But the Seattle is not representative of Mo like California. You know, everybody thinks that La is like California. Okay. Good pickers field. It's not that far away. Take a drive and take a drive. Uh, you know, up to uh, some of the weird fucking spot near the mountains off the one that first time I, even when I went to Sacramento, when I landed at the airport, I'm like, what the fuck? This is California. Exactly. Go to Fontana. They used to call it [inaudible] Tuckey when we were doing the fear factor.

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       Yeah. The dude, I know there was a place nearby where a meth lab blew up in this guy's backyard. Yeah. Go ahead and fucking meth lab in his backyard. Normal regular everyday California community. It's a California is, we think of California. Everybody immediately thinks of like Beverly Hills Hollywood, just traveling an hour outside named direction. You might as well be in Oklahoma. You know, there's a lot of spots in California that are fucked up.

Speaker 1:          02:46:37       Wow. That drive up to San Francisco where you go through all the agricultural towns. If you're a kid, your mom shit you out. One of these towns, you had to go to these local schools and like Jesus Co rice and you know you're just a two hour drive to la. If you could just get a car, just get a car. He could fucking end this nonsense. So a moment in high school, the moment you get some freedom, your friend's got a fucking car and you've got a full tank of gas. So let's do what we going into the La. Let's go to La. You drive down and wish you lived here. See how the civilized people, no dirt roads wish you wish you could be here. Said it's funky. Fuck an agricultural town with right ring Republican billboards everywhere. Everywhere you go, it's all these different republican candidates for president and senator and they're super right wing up there and they're fighting over water now.

Speaker 6:          02:47:29       Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:47:29       now when you drive up there, it's all these things about water rights. Like go to this website and check out this. We need, you know, we need, we need to establish our water rights.

Speaker 6:          02:47:42       It's weird.

Speaker 1:          02:47:43       Almonds apparently suck up a bunch of it.

Speaker 6:          02:47:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:47:47       Can we just stop using almonds? If we just know almonds, a no golf, how much water would you have? Fuck load almonds, almonds, apparently talk tastes old. Takes a lot of water to make an almond. Yeah. I think it still wouldn't help though. It would only help a little. They say, apparently this is the worst drought that California has ever on record and that we're four years into this fucked up drought that they need something like 11 trillion gallons of water just to break even. And the unlikelihood of that happening, pump it out of Houston. They were about to get flooded tomorrow again. Yeah. Right. If they could pump oil out of Houston one, can they pump water because we don't use as much oil as we use water. That's why.

Speaker 6:          02:48:28       Yeah,
