Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches, you know, when so many people are dead or driven or, or the, her entire life is about fear and it's all, it dictates everything that they do versus following your gut and putting the fear aside and once you do it makes all the difference in life. Yeah. Fears good. It is a motivating factor. Yeah. Well it's also the lack of fear can be very dangerous. Absolutely. One of the things that I always say like people that are not scared when they're fighting, like those two people are in trouble. You're in trouble, man, you should be fine. Nobody likes to be scared, but when I was competing, the worst tournament's that I ever fought in, I was not nervous. It was too confident and I just performed poorly. But when I was fucking terrified and like completely on edge, then your body's just, it's just primal.

Speaker 1:          00:46          It's just like you get down to that, that the bare minimum amount of understanding of what, what you have to do of the thinking of the, the, the rest of the world fades away and all you're thinking about is that task. You cutting out everything else. There's no thought about bills. There's no thought about the future. There's just what's going on in front of you right now. And if you can get down to that, that's when you perform at your best. But it's fucking terrifying. So nobody likes it. Nobody likes to be like, when you see guys that are in like the UFC that are like, like here's a good example and I'm a big fan of Luke rockhold. I think he's an awesome, we were just talking about on the way to, he was way too relaxed. Thought he was going to kill Michael Bisping.

Speaker 1:          01:26          Michael bisping fought that fight. He was going in against a fucking silver back gorilla. He was terrified or not terrified, but you know, jacked up with nerves and like you always on the line for him. Yeah. That's how you walked. Knocked him out. Such a great sport because first knock out too in the UFC, it's just first Kao like that. That's how you sell them on the way to Jorge Rivera in Manchester and beat down may him Miller is a Tko but the Tkos. Yeah. I mean he's also sitting down and its punches better. Jason Parillo, his boxing coach has really been working with him and done a fantastic job with him and with Cris Cyborg and a bunch of other people that the buildup to that reminded me of Keith Jardeen talking about Houston Alexander. It was like, I kept thinking like, man, he's really dismissive, like cannot even in my league and all that stuff and all of a sudden you're done.

Speaker 1:          02:17          Yeah, you can't. When a guy's a professional fighter, if you just stood there and let him punch you in the face, would it knock you out? Yeah, absolutely. Okay. So that it can fucking happen. They kind of lose a bit of time. Yeah. And the last thing you want to be is the guy that says, this guy can't beat me. I'm going to go in there and fuck them up. And then you wake up with a flashlight in your eyes like, what? What's going on? The Dr. Santiago, we don't move. You're like, aw, shit. What happened motherfucker. Yup. And then you have to deal with that. That ego that allow the ego tells you that it's gonna protect you from all this. You know, you're the baddest motherfucker. You don't have to worry about shit who I don't even have to worry. And then you're like, God dammit, ego.

Speaker 1:          02:55          Ego leaves you alone. Like, where are you now? Bitch gone. It's okay to say it. Just believe it. Yeah. Yeah. And even if you say it, you gotta be real fun. Yeah. You gotta be looking at her saying it too. These guys are killers. I mean, I just, man, that sports awesome. It's a crazy sport is Brendan's got me into it and I never missed a fight. Now have you come live yet? I have, yeah. Where have you been to live? Went to the Thompson Hendrix. I've been at like 25 of them. Yeah, he was at Thompson Hendrix know Lorenzo Fertitta. His nephew owns go hunt. Yeah. So it runs on our buddy. So he took me, we got full access. Oh, that was beautiful. Oh, that's beautiful. Yeah. The big ones coming up next weekend, you'll see to the experience alive then on TV. Yeah. I was like, wait, I need to be able to hear Rogan so I know what's going on.

Speaker 1:          03:39          Well, they have these little things, these little radios that you can get at the, uh, you know, the concession stand. Can you really? Yeah. Most, most arenas have them now. And you take these little radios and you turn them on and it actually has a frequency that picks up the commentary. Really? Yeah. It's excellent. It's really cool. I missed that part of it. Well, there's sometimes something's going on. You don't know what happened. Yeah. And like, like they stopped the fight. Like, why'd they stop the fight? You don't realize, oh, it's fucking legs broken or, yeah, exactly. You can, it takes a while. Yeah. Yeah. Commentary. And it also, uh, I believe you can get, I'm not sure about that. There might just be fight pass. One of the cool things about UFC fight passes, you could listen into the corners. Oh, you can. Yes, the corner guys are miked up.

Speaker 1:          04:17          So you can, you can hear like someone saying, Oh, you know, his hands broke, or Oh, you know, uh, this is what you gotta do that you wouldn't, you just get, you get insight. And you also get a sense of a building up anticipation. Like if you know that a guy's got an injury and then he's trying to gut it out, it makes it even more exciting to watch. You know? I mean, yeah, it's an awesome sport. Like I said, I only got a couple of hobbies watching mma, hunting. That's it. And then they're, they're very, it's very, they're very comparable, like know from going from being a wrestler. I mean, you, I mean, it's just, it's exciting. It's slow portions of nothing in this training and grinding and all of a sudden, and then every now and again you get a step in and, and, and, and see where you're at.

Speaker 1:          04:56          I mean, it's, it's, it's, you know, like you always say like two guys. I mean that's, that's a stripped down to the gets. You either win or lose at 50 50 I'm either going to win or I'm not. And same with hunting. I mean at at certain point in time and that hunt, you either either get them or you don't like the percentages work out like that. I mean that's, that's the cool thing about it. Well I think also like hunting, it's very, it's not perceived correctly by a lot of people. It was very misunderstood and a lot of people think of it as this barbaric, awful thing involving bullies and assholes when really they're incredibly intelligent, difficult people were pursuing one of the most, one of the most difficult things to do with dire physical consequences. If you fail those bullies and assholes, they don't have the dedication that get there.

Speaker 1:          05:37          Those aren't the real guys. Well they don't have the understanding of who they actually are. The T in order to face your own fears, like a lot of the bullies and the assholes, like you can get a certain distance with that, with physical power and genetic attributes. Make some guys just hit fucking hard and they're just good at taking a shot. And if you stand in front of them, whale with them, they might catch you and knock you out and beat your ass. And you just got beat by a bully. But the reality is when those guys get to a steep emile chick or Cain Velasquez or you know, uh, the best of the best, they're going to get fucked up. Yeah. Because those guys are just as just as physically strong, just as kate, but also have their mental shit in order. You have their ego in order. They have their understanding in order. And those guys are some of the nicest, most down to earth people you ever going to meet because they get their ego checked on a daily basis. Every one of them I met. We have some guys that are customers of ours, um, Tj and, and Mendez and I mean, they're really sharp guys. Very Sharp and very nice, very polite, not assholes. Very thoughtful. I mean, just great people to be around.

Speaker 2:          06:52          Okay.
