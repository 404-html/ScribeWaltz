Speaker 1:          00:00:34       and go. No, Brenda Wa you film this too, right? Yes. It's on Ustream right now. Yeah, it goes, you got your own camera over the jail? Yes. There's a camera for you. It was a camera can say if you want some come. Thanks. I'm getting piece of this. We've got to go crazy. If I get behind the every now and then, come on over a little. The door's always open. Well, we used to do it on the couch where used to get a big view of all three of us at once.

Speaker 3:          00:01:01       I saw that with Stan hope, I think, or I saw it with somebody and it was, it seemed seemed odd at Beth.

Speaker 1:          00:01:07       The couch is wicked. I'm comfortable. Just wasn't good. It wasn't good for talking. You think that accounts should be like really comfortable with but nothing can fuck with a good office chair. Yeah. I think they got office chairs figured out. You know you can get in this sucker and you know it's, it supports your back. Your arms have a good comfy place to rest. It's way better to sit in office chairs and couches. Chairs now sponsored the show, correct it. Should I wait a flashlight?

Speaker 3:          00:01:29       I think. I think movie theaters or fee figuring it out too now because they used to have like really good comfortable chairs where that you could have like the thing that goes up when you put your drink in then you can make it a couch. The other day I went to a theater and they had torn out all those chairs and went back to the old style where you can't move the, the, the armrest anymore. And I was like wondering why and then you think about it was a lot more comfortable though. Like the actual chair part. So now I'm thinking they're just designing what theater was that. My numbers. So universal citywalk uh, they, yeah, they're nice. That's probably, they're dealing with too many douchebags doing stupid things to those cup holders. And I think by douchebags you mean Mexico.

Speaker 1:          00:02:07       I was gonna say Mexicans, but I'm glad you didn't stood there is no more if you want, if you're from out of town, you'll like gear from Illinois and no, we don't have a lot of Mexicans out in Joliet. This is what you need to do just for a fucking goof. Take a trip, come to Hollywood. And the first thing I need you to do is go to a movie at city walk on like a Friday night. Yeah. And there's two things going on. There's the movie and then there's a show where the young Mexican kids are yelling out at the stage trying to make each other laugh. Yeah. Which is funny. It's ongoing. I mean, again, you're prepared for it. Yeah. If you've, I've heard people yell funny shit out. I was with a girl once and she yelled out. I've heard of people yell funny shit out too, but I was with a girl once and she yelled out at these guys that were talking while the movie was going on and she didn't tell me she was going to do it either. She just turned and, and this was when I first moved to Hollywood too, right? I was fucking ultra paranoid. I'd heard all these crazy things like when you're driving down the street,

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       if you guys will drive with their headlights off and when you flash them to let them know that there are headlights are on. Well it's a gang initiation thing. They have to find you and kill you. That's cause I was out here then 93 yeah. That's like where get like Nwa and all that shit was hot and it was, it was scary. It was, I mean, I don't know if it was all all paranoia, but it was like, it felt different. There's a lot of posers, there's a lot of people that were really legit gangsters. Like I've read up, there's a great book about the crips and the bloods and history of gang banging and La. It's a fascinating book. I'm sorry, I forgot the title of it. There was an HBO documentary too. That was really good. What it's means it's been going on since forever, you know, I mean it's just, it is the way it is.

Speaker 4:          00:03:41       But when rap music and Gangsta rap got really popular, that was when like the whole country started to be aware of this and then as people started acting like them, you know, so anyway, the point is, I'm in this movie theater, so I'm with this girl, she's a nice girl. She just misguided, you know, excuse me, would you please shut up? We're trying to watch this movie. And I'm like, Oh fuck. Was she got it for saying that or for going out with any of that? Both. Both clearly but clearly for going and going into his hand and immediately. Yeah, yeah. And then that automatically you're responsible. Yeah. And I'm like, I'm going to die. She had done a couple of things like this before. She would have like cut off people and traffic and shit. Like if someone got in front of her, she would like speed up, go into the oncoming lane and cut them off.

Speaker 4:          00:04:28       Yeah, she was fucking crazy. And maybe it's Chicago thing. She was from Chicago. I like a year. Nice girl. She was a nice girl. Other than that it was weird cause most of the time she was super friendly but when she felt like anybody was fucking with her, she would get like really angry and like go to a 10 like you said, like right away, you know, and I think they need at movie theaters, uh, going back to that is that they needed, I know that you're supposed to turn off your cell phones during movies and stuff like that, but instead of if you see some guy running the movie that the worst thing is actually having to go out and find him. Imagine being able to like text it or going to text a projection is, hey, just so you know, it's fucking quiet in here.

Speaker 4:          00:05:05       Or we were encouraging texting and complaining. I completely agree. But it should be like only for emergencies, you know, like, Nah, you can't ensure that people go to emergency, you know, do use it only during emergencies. When you give people the option to text, I mean look, look at fucking youtube comments. That's what you're going to get in your text. You got to get those same retards. They're just finally getting to the theater. I have a, I don't care. People text during the movie really don't care. I care if they're near me. Man. It's like the blue light care of him doing standup and cemetery. It's like as long as they're not, as long as it's not, I'd way rather than texts than talk. Yes, I agree. Because I love to text so I get, you know what I mean? Like I enjoy it and I don't want to, I certainly don't want an iPhone. Yeah, I'm rocking and iPhone. Okay. You don't fuck with droids I fuck with a droid. Yeah. I fuck with the

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       HTC evo four g. How'd you log it? They should be ashamed of themselves for releasing a telephone with that crappy battery ashamed of themselves. It's like the fact that it even went to market yet, this iPhone is the best anything I've ever had. That's a problem with all the four g's and androids. All the four g's and an android phones all have usually have the worst battery life must because of the screen. I would spend most of the day managing the better. Yeah. I had a droid for a day, the droid to at the slide out keyboard for one day and I brought it back to them. I was like, you gotta be fucking kidding me. It's a battery. I've played with it for 20 minutes for the full battery and it had half a battery life and yeah, 20 minutes. That's ridiculous. And they're like, oh, you need to download.

Speaker 3:          00:06:41       You know man, come on man. Fuck I do you guys need to get your shit together. Yeah. Why can't they figure that shit out at all? But outside of that figure out how to shut people the fuck up and movies. I mean, look, we can boot man now, but try to get Mexicans is telling, yelling out funny shit. Keep Mexicans out of city. Does the phone itself though is pretty good, right? Hmm. Other than the battery life phone? No, the HTC evo. It's fine. I was always nervous about it was like I worked for the phone like look I got to get, I should look it off cause I don't want my phone to act crazy like this is, it was fine. Yeah. I can hear you're always worried about the battery life. I'm still a little bit worried about it and I haven't had too much.

Speaker 3:          00:07:33       That is a fucking terrible feeling. Looking down in your shit says 10% battery life left and like you're out. Oh yeah. I'm so [inaudible] right now. It's going to try midnight and my phone's going to turn it into a Turkey. It was going to go with the back to the future thing. It's like my hands disappearing. Was that when Marty McFly Yan would disappear when he looked fine? Yeah. It's like you have that picture when you time traveling you always have to look at and make sure you're not like destroying. So you're an older guy. Cinderella's more of a reference for you. I have daughters, young guys. Keep up with the hot movies like back to the future, which came out 26 years ago that God does stand up biff from back to the future. It does stand up. I always see him at the comedy store. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:08:19       Real Nice Guy. I've never seen him at the store see there. I've seen him four times there. What is his name? Uh Fuck. I don't know. But yes, there you go. He's real nice and actually there was, I know how many people hate this but they had that, this class there, you know that taught comedy to people or stuff like that and he actually was making an appearance to do like a speech was the last time I saw him there. Right. You were taking the class? No, I was just out smoking. I see. Were teaching the class. I was just there hanging. I don't have any problem with classes. A lot of people do and they say that the people that are teaching the classes are losers and that's why the teaching the, and they have nothing

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       really to teach. I think anything that lets people just try it and it, and some people like some sort of a structure and that is a structure. The structure of a classroom, you know, you're curious. You know you have a job you don't like God man to try open. Mike night is calling class. I'll just sign up for that. And that's a step. I think it

Speaker 5:          00:09:12       and we'll get hot. Like everyone that comes out of it's awful. Yeah. It's not like they're, they're good comedians that have come out of it. Sure. I don't, I can't remember any of them, but like, here's what I'll say that are the, have the top 20 comedians of all time gone to a comedy class?

Speaker 1:          00:09:28       No. Yeah. It's not necessary. No, but it's not, you know, it's a start. It's a start. It's any sort of, it's any sort of a jumpstart. There's something about comedy, man, this is a very daunting, the idea of getting up for the first time with owning your own words and no one helping you. Some people like, hold my hand, hold my hand, get me on the stage. You know, that's all they need. They need, so it'll help.

Speaker 5:          00:09:47       Yeah. So go ahead and anyhow, that were sponsored by Neil Brennan and Joe Rogan's comedy. We're going to start one up next week. You, you started comedy later in your life. Are you, did you grab onto it quickly or were you always in this scene and she was always in, that's how I know. I've known a old man Rogan hair for a ninth, 18, 19 years. Wow. Yeah, he's still work. I work the door at the Boston Comedy Club, uh, for Barry Katz. I made $235 a week. Uh, which did Barry take a cut? I'm sorry man. I don't know what welcome to show business. That's a good one. That's a really good one. Uh, so, uh, so yeah, so I was always just around it, but I was, I don't think that I, I was more like shy and retiring and like, ah, you guys, go ahead. I kid and I could never, and I also, I also judge my own desire for attention and be like, what a low impulse to want attention from strangers. And then, you know, and then at a certain point it was like, I don't want attention from strangers, but also I was sick of other parts of show business telling me that I wasn't funny when I was positive. I was, um, we, if I'd write a script and they'd be like, Eh, okay. And then you'd go do standup person.

Speaker 1:          00:11:09       We had this exact same tone of the conversation with Brian Post saying yesterday we were talking about writing and the idea of delivering stuff to people that aren't funny and they get to judge you on whether or not it's funny and how hard it is to make a fucking TV show. It's, it's, it's unbelievably hard to get past all these people that, uh, have a say.

Speaker 5:          00:11:28       Yeah. Well Post saying, I thought post saying we both did two days on the Oscars this year. Yeah. The Oscar telecast and uh, cause Jordan Ruben, who's a funny dude and I've known him forever, it was like, Hey, will you come Judd sort of supervising. So I was like, all right, Judd Apatow. It was like getting judge good, greatest due like two days. We impose saying they, we pitched stuff, they use none of it.

Speaker 6:          00:11:54       And then I saw Judd like a week later I was like, Hey, are you doing anything with that? Oscar's saying he's like, I don't know, they send me shit but I don't know. So it was like, oh okay. It's just, they use Judd to like get you in and then you, and then it ended up being an atrocity. The funniest part was I was just shitting on and on Twitter, just going off on it like and do like being really funny. And then it, the telecast ends and it's like written by Neil Brown. I was like,

Speaker 4:          00:12:19       oh wait, did I just see Neil Brennan, other guys? It was a different time. Did you have to almost a year ago, did you have to write the fake conversation? So we just try to come up completely. Most of them aren't pattern. Like I'm here, we're here to like the the, the guy. Well I should say literally, I've never watched an award show ever. I've been in the real man. I've been in like the spike award shows a couple of those. Right. I've never watched one.

Speaker 6:          00:12:50       That's great. I uh, I almost didn't do the Oscar saying cause I hate award show so much cause I think they're awful. Yeah, exactly. They're just, they just make everyone that's not their feel like shit. And they encourage losers too. Like you can dream and you can be here. No you can't, unless you have crazy talent, you can't

Speaker 4:          00:13:13       be there. I don't have any problem with that aspect of it. My problem with it is first of all, the idea of judging art is ridiculous because it's so subjective and it's so inside. And what you get is you get the, the people that judge it have so much influence over what gets released. Cause there's people that target those people with their work. Yes. Because they know that these type of movies get this tied bubble. That's what's funny is happening, having

Speaker 6:          00:13:36       cast a movie and, and Ben is, and it drives me crazy. And I even said, you know what's crazy? I see it in podcasts as well. People will cast who like in movies, they'll caste the person from the hot TV show. So if there's a movie they're like, you know, we should get a guy from the wire. And it's like, oh, what a great idea. How do you think, I remember when I was pitching, when you pitch to direct a movie, I directed a movie for paramount called the goods. That pivot was in Calin. I love it. Thank you very much. It's funny people didn't see it, but um, and uh, so I remember I was pitch when you pitch to direct the movie, you have to go like some casting ideas and for one of the casting ideas I was like, you know, it'd be great in this part is Warren Beatty.

Speaker 6:          00:14:19       And they're like, that's a great idea. How did you think of that? And it's like, I watched the movies and I saw Warren Beatty like that. But that's an idea. You know what I mean? It's like, it's a fucking sheet of paper and it's like he's good, he's not good. But the idea that they, they go like, we got to get the guy from the wire or we got to get the guy from the office, like everyone from the office. Then they're the only people in comedy with value is like, cause they're the critically acclaimed show. Uh, that, and then people can't even see where they're like, oh, Tina's a great, Tina's. Tina is really funny. But they're like, Tina's amazing all that pail and stuff that she wrote. She didn't write it. Seth wrote it. Seth Myers wrote it like, but the idea that you can't, uh, it just becomes like, did you, if someone said to me today, did you see what trace at what Tina said about Tracy? Yeah, it was fine. Like condemning Tracy, but these people just get such a markup, uh, which you've probably never gotten. I would get a, during Chappelle show was like, what's next?

Speaker 3:          00:15:23       W what do you mean by a markup? You get like, you get upgraded automatically. Like everything, my ideas are better because of, because of that, just automatically. Yes, I agree with you. I agree with you about like the office and every Steve Carell movie has to be brilliant and he's always hilarious. That's why I like no name actors. Like, remember when we first saw it, what 300? Like, like all these actors are like, yeah, yeah. Like brand new to you. I hate that dude. No. Yeah, I know, but still, it's the fuck out of me now. I'm sure he's a great guy. I don't hate them. I'm just saying every time I see him at some fucking stupid Jennifer Aniston movie he did goofy smack of is les is his lips. How fucked up here Elliot to from Super Eight, uh, he's brand new kid. Never been been in a movie already. Can tell that kid is going to be in movies now and there's like a bunch of actors do man. Well. Yeah, it's funny like what they, you do good work or personal work and then they'll go, um,

Speaker 6:          00:16:17       like I always used to say to Chappelle and most def after we do a sketch, I'd be like, fellas, it was a great sketch. Hollywood called and they want you to play cops. Like,

Speaker 3:          00:16:27       like Hollywood calls and then you're fucking upgraded into some shit. You didn't want the first place, but you're so award shows and shit like he and entertainment tonight, it's good for your career. You should do it, but it, yeah, but it, it, it trains you to, it brainwashes you into thinking like that Hollywood is valuable and you just fucking walk like a Zombie toward dollars and get like, where do I stand here? We'll then Hollywood pussy. And that's when, that's when the game changes. That's when it does become valuable. You know, when you go into a club and everybody goes fucking, you ever seen chocolate, Dell and the club? Yeah. I like kind of months ago I saw, I've seen chocolate, Dylan, the club you when you see that level of fame, you know, and you'll talk with Delta MMA fighter. That's what's funny is I would mean nothing to me. Like you're not a young horse. It could be chocolate dough. Are you tracking with that? Yes. Uh, do young horse go crazy? Cause I wouldn't even think girls would know an MMA guy. Delirious MMA loop. I know you're, you're the

Speaker 6:          00:17:30       exact opposite but I'm not, I'm not for it against it. I just am out of it.

Speaker 3:          00:17:35       Huge percentage of girls know who those guys are. Huge. It's a big percentage. You're also in that road also and like, like my girlfriend doesn't know who any of these people are in either did the prior or the prior. Like none of them did. Like he ha there a point and those are the girls that

Speaker 6:          00:17:50       are willing to fuck you. I mean the level of broad, we're talking about it. I mean the real trash, there's not many girls that Lashi and tired. Easy. The human flashlights. Go ahead. There's definitely a huge, huge, a bigger percentage of male. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. My point is the reason why these guys, once they get into movies and they get big and then they start going to clubs and it's just fucking calling the winner circle where it's just like everyone's during the winter, like literally you, I it's like, it's, remember the Eddie Murphy sketch where they're like silly negro when he dresses up like a white guy and uh, and he, he like the world turns around and like he gets a bank loan and all that, um, immediately because he's white. Uh, and, and the banker goes up a black, he had just turned down a black guy and he goes, silly Negro.

Speaker 6:          00:18:36       Anyway, how much money you need. We got to any just starts throwing money at Eddie. Why Daddy? That's what it's like to like be successful. They like the old rules don't apply. I remember going to shows with Chappelle and people and they, and or pin and they, people literally don't, they don't ask for tickets. They don't, it's like you do whatever you want, walk right in. Do you can't, this is a legit, it's fine. Yeah, come on. You're good. You're good. Oh, you're good. It's fascinating stuff. Uh, Vegas, it's the craziest, well, yeah, exactly. I've been to Vegas with him and a couple of times and, and uh, it really is like one time the best me and pivot we were doing when we were doing the goods. Uh, we went out for a fight for, um, I think it was Ricky Hatton and a Floyd Mayweather, which is a hilarious fight mostly because all the Ricky Hatton fans like booed the national anthem.

Speaker 6:          00:19:31       It was like hilarious. It's like movie funny, like with like doing, filling this shit where they're building the national land. They brought like a kettle drum and it was awesome. Uh, so we were, we flew private, which is also great. Um, and when you fly private, you're like in a, it's basically like going to a rental car place, uh, where they don't really say like, you have to line up and you just, they just got, oh, what's your wind number? And you go, SJ, whatever. They go, yeah, the planes out there. So they're like, yeah, the plants out me and pivot or killing time, just kind of fucking around. And then we're like, we should go into the plant. We get on the plane. Sly Stallone has been waiting for us. Yeah. So that's Chalan it's been waiting for us so that they can, it was like the planet Hollywood jet a and we ended up going flying to a fight in Vegas.

Speaker 6:          00:20:17       Hollywood has a jet, uh, just because they were like falling apart at one point in time. This was before they, I don't know. I, and maybe they just charged out of casinos. Flies. Jet? Yeah. I don't know. Oh yeah. No, it was to go to the casino. So the casino is sending you guys out for what? For an event or sending? It was, it was getting sly and then they were like, and get pivot. Was there an event or something? It was the fight. Oh, the fight. So they were flying you in for the fight? Uh, yeah. I guess there were flying sly in and then we

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       hopped a Rut. So I get upset at you now. He was. He was, he was real cool about it. He's a funny dude. I met him once. Very nice to talk to him. That's funny. Yeah, he's very good. He, the thing, the great thing about him is he understands who he is to people. He doesn't, I mean he'll go like, hey, I'm a rocky. Yeah. Instead of like, hey, that was a long time ago and like he understands like he knows what anecdotes people want to hear and shit. Like he seems very genuinely friendly too. Yes and happy. Yeah. Fun. Yeah. A really enjoyable guy to look up. You're going to fly in a private jet deal with slide 64 and fucking shredded cocoa butter. Does he smell like cocoa butter? It seems like it would smell like a cocoa butter because Kendra car, he doesn't not smell like cocoa butter. All right. I wouldn't rule it out. The bouquet,

Speaker 1:          00:21:38       he's what I call our canary in a coal mine. We'd never seen a 64 year old looked like that before.

Speaker 5:          00:21:42       Yeah. Who knows how like his face looks like meat art, like strips of meat, combine like bacon forehead. And like, that's a great way to put it. It really is like his nose was made of like mutton. Well, there's certainly something

Speaker 1:          00:21:58       then going on with his forehead. There's been times when it was shiny and mobile, which always disturbs the fuck out of me when I see is that guy you think that takes g h a botox?

Speaker 5:          00:22:08       Right? Okay. Yeah. Uh, surgery and Botox. What do you into these days? What's your

Speaker 1:          00:22:13       okay, my cocktail. Yeah. I go to, I've described it on the podcast, but so in brevity, I go to a hormone replacement therapist and what they do is they look at your hormone levels and they, first of all, they give you vitamins and adjust your nutrition. That's the first step. How often do you go? Every couple of months I get blood work done and then go and have all my stuff checked. And once you will, they adjust it as much as they can with nutrition, which can make a huge difference. Uh, especially, uh, eating shitty food. You'd be amazed at how much that lowers your testosterone, lowers your human growth hormone. Yeah. You shitty died. I'm V incredibly bad. Are you? Yeah. And then, um, once he adjusts you enough with nutrients, then they give you a very small levels of human growth hormone and testosterone. Thyroid, I have hypothyroidism. So it was taking thyroid medication before this. And all it does is it basically brings your home levels up to a healthy man of like 25 to 30 years old. And as you get older, you know, your body just stops producing hormones. It's a, it's really simple. It's, and it's preparing you for death basically. And you can either choose to accept that and just let your body slowly kind of deteriorate. Or you can replace the hormone.

Speaker 5:          00:23:27       I honestly want to do that. It's a, sorry, can I see it as like a, it's, it's a, it's a health move. It affects so many aspects of your life. Any side of it. I have there been any side effects? Weakens your bones? No, no, no. You were so with what

Speaker 1:          00:23:45       I heard, he's so good. Was it that or is it that or lip something with the liver? It's one of the two. No, no, no, no, no. It was steroids can give you liver, but those are oral down. This stuff is oral, oral. This, the deliver stuff is the stuff that your liver has to process cause you're eating it for the most part. One of the side effects is having a podcast. Go ahead. Yes, that's number one. Well if you, the side effects come from abuse. The side effects of all performance enhancing drugs come from abuse. If steroids and performance enhancing drugs were as dangerous as they said, people would be dropping in the fucking streets. Right. You know, where are the bodies when you hear about these pro wrestlers dying, it's not steroids that are killing them and these guys were on massive doses of steroids.

Speaker 1:          00:24:22       It's pills for the most part, unless it's suicide and a lot of them, they're dealing with concussions and all sorts of other stuff and a lot of them get very depressed. But the abuse is what's really dangerous. As long as you're going to a doctor and as long as you're eating really healthy and monitoring your nutrients, you got to, you got to give your body the tools to repair itself. It's so important. So many people don't eat any fucking vegetables. They don't eat shit. And this is why Brock Lesnar, who was the UFC heavyweight champion, he had diverticulitis because of his bad diet. He had a diet where he would only eat meat, he would eat steaks. Diverticulitis. Diverticulitis is it's, you have basically a protein gets stuck in your gut and it starts creating abscesses and it can, you know, eat a hole through your fucking stomach.

Speaker 1:          00:25:08       And with him, it got so bad that he almost died get hospitalized. They thought they were going to have to give him surgery on it and then they decided that they didn't. But then because of all his training, when he's training, it starts to flare up again because once you have it, apparently it can recur. So they had to remove 12 inches of his fucking colon, oof, 12 inches of his colon. This is all diet related. You know his case, they used it for Stallone's face. I knew you were going there a call back, but this guy's diet was so, it's fucked them up so bad. And some people are absolutely correct that it's not always diet related. Doing so when he pointed this out that you can, it can be a congenital thing, but it wasn't in his case. In his case it was, and he didn't eat any fucking vegetables.

Speaker 1:          00:25:51       He didn't eat broccoli. You didn't need any fiber. You've got to clean your system out. So for me, it's it, it does, first of all, it helps your immune system. It keeps you from getting sick. It helps you recover from things you know, and when you're doing it correctly and properly with the right nutrients and very low levels, everything has a very low level. You can't get crazy with anything when you're doing it. It helps you. You feel better, you have more energy, you feel like you enjoy life more, you're happier. You know, it's, it's so simple. It's like the reason why people are old and cranky as cause they're tired as fuck. Okay. Their bodies stop producing hormones and that's not good. It may hate at all. Ethnic groups is the first thing that happens. Sure. You get cranky, you can't, you just use that new, but it's people's dead or something. Know what, like it just seems mover, right? No, but there is negative side effects to it. Right? Well look, there's not enough people doing it for them to have real studies. Right. Are you constantly

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       monitoring all this? Because that is pretty hard. Quarterly I would be like on Twitter every day. Like, look, people have been substituting hormones forever. I mean thyroid medication has been around forever and people have been doing that forever. This is not that much difference between substituting your thyroid hormones are substituting pituitary hormone gland. You know what I'm doing is that deer antler spray, you know that that helps. Supposedly spray can put supposedly pumps up your HGH levels. Uh, I, and I find that if I just jog or even a couple of miles, you can get it. You can order it online is, it was, it tastes light a, it tastes kind of delicious. It doesn't taste bad. It's because there's some controversy whether or not it works. A lot of football players use it, but some people do believe that it does work maybe in small levels.

Speaker 4:          00:27:28       But that's been actually I just find like when I exercise they can recover quicker. Really? Yeah. You really feel a difference that much. It's funny cause I stopped doing it for awhile and then I was like, why am I sore? And it was because I, I mean I at least empirically that was the, it's you know, it's right now it's at a stage where it's, there's a lot of experimental shit going on with hormone replacement therapy. I mean obviously it wasn't around for our parents is this generation is the first generation. It's sort of experimenting with things like that. You and I are really at the avant garde of that. They were on the edge, bro. Gotti canaries in the room.

Speaker 4:          00:28:02       I said, what do you, what do you, how do you, what does it do to you physically doing that? You feel much better. You feel healthy, you recover better. I mean, I've always been a guy who exercise and I've always been in shape, so I never really let myself get to a position where I ever got frail or got out of shape. I should have adjusted along the way as I realized that I was getting older and then I wasn't recovering as fast as I was starting to get injured more. Then I started looking into it and so for the past like five, six years, I've been doing it. Great, and you do it. Like I said, as long as you're doing it with low levels and you're sitting margins on it. Yeah. It doesn't sound cheap. Less expensive. No, not really. No. As it scales out, it's not.

Speaker 4:          00:28:40       I mean, you can get some fucking shit from China that's not as, I wouldn't fuck around with that shit. That's what it was. My point was that what is basically is this low level genetic engineering. It's just the tip of it and what we're going to see over the next decade is some shit that's going to blow this completely the fuck out of one worst fear with this stuff. With, with taking this look your worst fear period, his death. Um, you know, but yeah, I believe that if you're taking care of yourself and you're watching your, your blood levels and you're reasonably safe, you know, as long as you're doing it with a good doctor and you know what, what the risks are and you know what the levels that you're taking on and you don't get crazy, that's a lot of people get crazy. And this is some things when you see like a guy who's a bodybuilder, you see like some big giant guy was giant muscles. There's only one way to get those fucking muscles. Okay. I mean, hard work. Yeah. You've got to take monstrous levels of shit where you get to put your body into a state that's completely unnatural and that's when things start firing. It's like having a computer and overclocking and hey man, I got a seller on 301 clock,

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       this bitch up to four 75. I got these coolers. Yeah. How long does that last? Those fucking things. They'd go out, you know, it blows out. And that's exactly the, like the human body. But if you're a smart and just keep it within levels, you know, long as you keep it within healthy levels, nothing hyper, nothing crazy. It was a lot of science behind it. There's a lot of studies behind it that show and there's a lot of really intelligent doctors that do do it to themselves and one of them happens to be a very good friend of mine who, uh, has been in this business for a while and he, you know, he's very, very well versed on all the pros and cons of hormone replacement therapy. And in his point is always the best. He's like, he's like, okay, here's what's going to happen. If you don't take it, you're going to get old. You're going to die. He goes, you're probably going to die if you take it too. But you're going to enjoy that time more. You're going enjoy that time where you're gonna enjoy your body more. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:30:28       I enjoy my body too. You really, I'm really and turn the lights down. I got a huge kick out of my own human body. What's your take on his wiener character pulling his cock out and taking pictures. Here it is. Uh, don't, if you're a guy, don't take a picture of your cock. Nobody because a girl doesn't really want to see it. Girls want to see like, maybe they might want to see your ass like, but more than anything they want to see like girls need their aesthetics that they need like lighting and fucking shadow. You know what girls want to say. They want to see that, that muscle. Sure. You know the name of the muscle where it like, it looks like your lower abdominal area heading in your cock. The ramp, the ramp, the garage door and give him the ramp abs. Uh, they want abs. I want Rep. They don't want caulk. All right. So that I would say, don't do it. Don't ever just be like, oh, sorry baby, I got to go to sleep or whatever. A friend of mine, Jack, go ahead.

Speaker 1:          00:31:27       Sorry. I have to interrupt because a friend of mine is married and he's a great guy and he doesn't cheat on his wife. He's a comic. And, um, uh, this girl send them an email, oh, you're so hilarious. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I will, I would love to take you for a ride, you know, lol. And so he, uh, emails back like, Hey, um, uh, that's very nice, but a, I'm married, thanks. And so then she starts saying, oh, well, I totally understand and I think that's really awesome and you're married and you know, and I, I totally, completely respect that. And then, uh, well you're hilarious. Anyway, send. So then an email comes a minute later and it's her and her lingerie, lol. I totally fucked up and sent you this. Oh my God, I'm so sorry this sending this. So then he sends it back. Well, no, no harm done. Then she sends him pictures of her fingers, health. So then it's like, and then she's like, come on, I want to see your big fat cock. Send me a picture of big fat cock at this point. I'm like, that's it, dude.

Speaker 5:          00:32:27       Okay. That's a fucking dude. There's a dude who's trying to do that. You're getting trolled. You just went Boston and a fucking dude fucking queer. He's got his cock in his hand. The probably a bit and the other dude,

Speaker 1:          00:32:41       I will like you. You Go, you're getting trolled son. There's a guy who's trying to get a photo of this comedian's Dick for sure

Speaker 5:          00:32:47       going on here. That's why 90% of the time I send fake photos. That's what I was going to say. I, I what I, what you do with fellows, if you're really have to take a picture of go get a play girl, take a picture of a cock in the playgirl, send it. And then with the caption, mine is similar to this.

Speaker 1:          00:33:06       Send her the blackest one you can design and say picture one liked this, but white and maybe not quite as,

Speaker 5:          00:33:14       not quite as big, not quite as bad with better credit folks did. It will be quiet in a movie. My Cock. We'll be quiet in a movie theater. So did you, you didn't enjoy the half movie? Didn't I did enjoy it. Uh, not really. Cause you know, where'd you get this segue? We, well I wanted to bring that up. It's one of my favorite movies. He didn't, he didn't even enjoy it. I didn't hear if you should direct it. What did you know? I didn't Roni and Chappelle, Rhoda and um, uh, yeah, it was just, we were both like young and we didn't really understand like we should have rewritten it more. We kind got way late in term, the whole process. We just got way late. Like here's who is going to be in it. Here's your starting now here's the director. And we didn't know till we didn't know what to stand in time move like we didn't know like to say what fight to fight and uh, and so it just ended up being, there's parts of it I like, but for the most part it just sort of like didn't end up the way I'd hoped her day.

Speaker 5:          00:34:17       David hoped. I think. And maybe you might not have got what you wanted, but what you got was awesome. Oh yeah, totally. Yeah. Yeah. I mean people, I mean it got demolished at the box office, but having said that, we opened against titanic. Yeah. We opened against types Hanoch golden eye and goodwill hunting. Wow. Holy Shit. Haneke titanic

Speaker 1:          00:34:43       three asked me this or quite answered me this. Who the fuck is still going to see James Bond movies? Zero more suspense, less boring fucking series of movies where you have nothing invested in it. I couldn't give a shit and this new guy looks pretty bad ass

Speaker 5:          00:34:59       standard credit guy. You would like the first or second new one with him? I don't know. It's pretty bad. Do you like the Bourne movies? No.

Speaker 1:          00:35:09       Yeah. One guy kicking everybody's ass like that. I'm like, shut up. Somebody grabbed that dude. It's to me it's like someone playing guitar and a movie and they don't really know how to play guitar. Write. That shit drives me crazy. I have a very hard time watching a movie where one guy is doing all this crazy Kung Fu badass shit where I'm like, stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Which just drives me nuts. This guy took on 10 people. No, they would. They would grab him. That's not how people fight. They don't stand around you like a retard wagon train. Yeah. He fucking dive on you at once. Somebody

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       grabs your legs, they'd kick you in the fucking head and then your unconscious and then they raped them and kill you. That's why you make short films. You make very short action. Action films are 15 minutes long. It's a guy, he thinks he's a bad ass. They break in the warehouse, they fucking hold him down. They shoot him in the face and that's the end. And that's the end of the bureau credit. And they just learn you've lost a lot of money making these minutes. They're real. What people want is real. She tell you what you today you'd deliver them on the Internet. Very cheap to film with the CGI that's available on your Imac. You could pull it off. You're the Joe Rogan action film. So I'm fucking serious, man. Simple. I it was that move. What does it final cut pro tools and

Speaker 6:          00:36:21       what you're talking about is those like those, uh, the dude who the punch out videos. What's his name? The black dude who tried to Kimbo Kimbo videos? No, not entirely. With maybe a giant. Yeah. With like a soundtrack, getting chased by a giant penis. They Chase Kimbo and then he punched him.

Speaker 4:          00:36:40       I've never been one for trying to come up with movie ideas, that very reason. So that was your first movie. You did that.

Speaker 6:          00:36:49       And then I wrote a couple of scripts in between there that didn't get made, and that was, I sold them, but they didn't get made. And then that was the period where I was like, why am I, it just was making me a little crazy. That's when I started doing standup a little bit. Um, the, but I remember when people, if for an idea of how stupid showbiz this is, me and a buddy of mine used to, we're pitching a movie in 99, 2000 and they were like, who do you want to be in it? And we were like, oh, Dave Chappelle welfare on, they were like, uh, how about Tom Green and Orlando Jones slow? And they were dead serious. That's that like heat game that I was talking about. It's like Rob Greene was hot firm and as a comedy where you're like, yeah, I think will Ferrel's way funny. Even Tom Green, like Tom Green's a stunt and they're like, what are you talking about? Stunt. They don't even understand what they're looking at, but they just go, there is a lot of commotion over here. Right. We got to get it. But they don't understand like, yeah, but to be that it takes some other shit and then obviously, uh, will and Dave proved to be the, the, um, in the long, the long money was on them.

Speaker 4:          00:37:53       Oh, for sure. I think Tom Green, if he's very misunderstood, I think if you watch his, uh, that movie Freddy got fingered. I think that's a good fucking movie. I haven't seen a rock. Chris Rock loves that movie. I've never seen. It's fucking hilarious. It's hilarious and crazy and that gross. That's really who he is. I mean, he's just as Nutty, dude. I mean, I know he's getting a bit of an anarchist, so like you look at his show that show that he did on fucking basic cable and Canada and then look at his show that he did on MTV. I think he's fucking hilarious. He's a, yeah, no, he is absolutely fine. Not Utilized correctly, which is why he decided to do his own thing, that web show. But the web showed to me sort of became like the tonight show. Yeah. He was trying to make it into something that was like really like he should just try not to swear.

Speaker 4:          00:38:37       And you know, at one point, and he was, he's Carson in. Yeah. It was like, it was going, it was just a different mode. Scaling shut down would have been the way to go. But he, he tried to keep it like, hey, big production. It's like, dude, it's the tried to do it. Like everybody else, there was a desk in a tie or a suit rather, you know, it was like the whole thing was set up like imitating all these ones that were under the confines of broadcast television and other people's opinions and input. And now here you have this thing where you have no confines. No one's telling you what to do. You can do whatever the fuck you want. You're just going to imitate whatever all these old schools Steve Allen guys have done before. You can seem silly to me. Uh, it seems silly to a lot of, it's not what he is.

Speaker 4:          00:39:20       You know what he is? That's funny is Freddy got fingered. It's fucking a dead Moose on the side of the highway. You know? Remember they got stand up now. I haven't seen it, but it's pretty good. I heard, I heard he's doing well. He's doing well. You know, and it's, it's always interesting when someone, so 39 years old or whatever the fuck they are when we tried to do stand up for the first time. It's kind of weird when you, and you're already famous like Charlie Murphy. I've, I went on that big maxim tour with Charlie. Mark did. Really? Yeah. Yeah. We meet him and John Heffron toward the country. We did like 22 gigs together, theaters and shit. And you know, Charlie fucking was 40 something years old before he ever did standup comedy. And he was famous as fuck before and offered his hand one of the best up, some hostile of all time.

Speaker 4:          00:40:04       Huge movie star. I mean his little brother pressure. Yeah. The pressure on him, his fucking tremendous. And through the roof. And all of a sudden this guy goes from being on this TV show to a year into standup comedy. Not even, I think nine months. He's headlining, headlining and doing theaters. These got to do 50 minutes. Yeah. It's fucking crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Ridiculous. Really hard to, it's hard. It's the worst way to do whatever. It's like what I always said about Brock Lesnar fighting in the UFC. You know, when Brooklyn's their first started fighting the UFC, he went immediately and fought the former champion and his first fight that he's fighting heath herring. He's fine. He's fighting nothing but killers right away. And I'm like, you know, yeah, he can do that. But you know what's the best way to do it? The best way to do it is to come up through the fucking ranks of the smaller shows.

Speaker 4:          00:40:47       Get less money. That's what I, when I was, when I started doing standup again, like people were like, you should go out and did it. And I was like, I don't have the time and I don't want to rip people off. Good for you. Now I've got the time and you're ready to rip people off. You can really rip some bump people off. I need money. Yeah, no, I, I need this so bad. So you weren't doing standup when you were, uh, one of the, when you were the producer of the Chappelle show, you weren't doing standup then job's the creator and Co Creator and writer, whatever you were the grand poobah of the Chappelle show. Grand Poobah, the Cro Grand Poobah you weren't doing comedy at that time? Mm. A little by little. I mean, you can when you have a TV show, because I didn't know of you as a comic.

Speaker 4:          00:41:32       No, I know one, no one did. The people are barely starting to get on board now. I remember when I did it, the first time I did it was that we were just walking down the street. We ran into Dave, he had a mustache on. He's like, hey Joe, you want to be on my TV show? The show wasn't even, didn't even exist. And bobcat Goldthwait was with direct. And then it's like, what am I going to go? I only have like a half an hour. He's like, okay, just hold this box. And we went out and wandered around and uh, he gave me boobs. Yeah, we had this ridiculous fucking donkey. Kong was totally forgot you were in. And then the second time I did it, I did it with you was when we did the fear factor. I was actually at the, at the bath. The one your boobs on the bobcat one.

Speaker 4:          00:42:15       Yeah. I didn't remember seeing you though. But I remember. But anyway, my point was that I just knew you as Neil, you know, I didn't, I didn't really know what your Gig in life was. You know? I knew that you worked at the Boston comedy club and yeah, and I would also like to note that you are always a really good dude when you didn't, when I didn't have credits, you were almost exactly, you are exactly like you are like, you weren't like, you're not, you're not one of these like you come on in. Oh God, you're not a star fucker. You're not, uh, uh, credit fucker unless it's struggle very hard to be the exact opposite. Well, no, but I, that's what's, I think that's where you live is a testament to that in this shithole. No law. No. He just lived in the middle of nowhere.

Speaker 4:          00:43:00       And by the way, I'm too close to people if I could. I mean, I lived in, uh, talked about this yesterday. I lived in the mountains of Colorado for four months. Did you not swear? I wanted to live last year till my dog got eaten by a mountain lion and my wife got pregnant and because my wife was pregnant by the mountain lions, the altos fee, it was a crazy week for the mass crimes trees. I'm in denial. It was Joe's worst week, the mountain lions, best week I, but my instinct is still live in the woods. I mean that's where I really would like to live as far away from. So I mean, I'm not much on Hollywood than a, an opportunity to make money. Yeah. And I'm sure you liked doing stand up. I love doing standing. Yeah. But I love doing standup because it's not Hollywood man.

Speaker 4:          00:43:42       When I was in Vancouver this weekend, that's, I'm in Vancouver, you know what I'm saying? There's nothing Hollywood about that. It was just me and a bunch of cool people in Vancouver and we're having a party and you know, I'm telling jokes and everyone's laughing and it's great time. Oh, you did a show where you did the stand up and then I did, uh, well I did two nights of stand up. I did one at the vogue tier. It was fucking awesome. First Time I've ever done it encore and never did an encore before. I went back out on stage. And then Ben is that she's told a lot of jokes to do, well not stolen claim their mind call or something I served George Carlin do once. I don't, I, I let people know. So I did, I did, uh, that and then the next night I did the comedy mix, which was used to be Yuk yuks which is the shit. It's Vancouver is a fucking amazing. I was up there for a while. One time, and I'm going to go back cause I'm starting to do now that I'm starting to go out and rip people off. Uh, none

Speaker 6:          00:44:32       of the club, first of all, what the clubs pay is a slave wage. Like what comedy clubs pay to have someone come in for the weekend is like what?

Speaker 1:          00:44:41       Well, if you haven't been there, this, the only reason is it's what it is, is if you don't draw, this is the bottom line. It's if you're just coming in for the weekend though, the reality is that most clubs have a very hard time selling tickets for an unknown comics. So would they have to do is they have to pay for the room. So they have to give away. So they can't afford to give the comic that much money. No, I get that. But they could, they can certainly afford to give them more than they're given. I don't know. I'm telling you man, it's hard out there. It's hard out there. And you know comics need to realize that look with social networking and Twitter and Facebook and all that shit, you can eventually build up your audience where you can ensure that hey, I can ensure you that you're not going to have to give away any tickets. You're going to sell this place out. And people have done that without even, you know, any television credits at all. There's a bunch of guys who are doing really well just on the Internet, but you got to work at it. You can't expect a club to just pick up the tab. So when

Speaker 6:          00:45:30       back to anyone but, but it's first of all there's plenty of clubs just won't headline me cause cause I haven't done enough TV. I don't know why. They don't know yet. They would on a week night. Yeah. No. So well, what I'm doing is do what I'm doing like music, venue, shit like that and getting most of the door. Yeah. And, and I have like 63,000 followers on Twitter, which isn't a lot

Speaker 1:          00:45:54       grants to you. 64 by the end of the day. How about that? No, actually you'll learn an in, you ain't tweeted, well that's the name of the game is getting celebrities to tweet you. And I know a lot of celebrities. Ooh, I know what if you retweet me, that

Speaker 6:          00:46:07       goes up. Um, so I'm hoping that the people that follow me on Twitter, we'll, you know, get into the spirit of like this kind of, we're doing it off the grid and which is what I like about this. I think they do too. And people will do stuff for free, which I think is a really cool, like people will just, I'll like, I'll say like, hey, can someone make a picture of blog of this, of like, oh, a Barack Obama with like a teardrop tattoo after the, after they've been long thing and someone made it. This girl, Rachel made it like in 20 minutes and a buddy of mine works in the White House, was writer for Obama who I met at the correspondence dinner and he goes, I showed it to everyone in the White House. I go, I go, how high up did again? And he goes, not as high as you want it to, but it got a pretty wide

Speaker 1:          00:46:56       and the show to Obama I know would appreciate it. Yeah. Obama's only 47 years. You don't think you would have been? Oh Shit. No, he would have thought it was funny. Oh Shit. Oh, shut up. Let me ask you this. Do you think that they really killed those bin been logged and dumped his body in the ocean?

Speaker 6:          00:47:11       Uh, the dumping, the body thing, I had a funny, the way they handled it was like the classic media manipulation. The thing that got me was the thing to where they go, you know, he used a woman as a human shield. That was the first thing that they release. So everyone goes that mother fucker because America didn't know how it going to play her. And at first

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       he was saying he was armed, he was armed and it used a woman as a human. Then they were like, wait a minute, wait a minute. Like a carts says Trump. The armed. Yeah, like a cartoon character. He used a woman as a human shield and you picture like a whore from Barney Miller. Well it's apparently it was, it wasn't him that used a woman as a shield. There was someone else but, but originally that's what they said and people, they know that the first story is a story people are going to remember. Right, right. And then they go, oh by the way, he didn't use a woman as a human scale. I've been telling people in the audience, it's like if I said to you like, Hey, I'm going to introduce you to my buddy Bobby. He said hate rate took a shit today at Mcdonald's and you think about that for an hour and a half.

Speaker 3:          00:48:07       And then I got by the way, he didn't take a shit. When you meet Bobby, you're still going to be picturing him taking a shit. And it's more to me, I think like people being accused of rape, but there's no way to unexcused everyone who gets accused of it. You have a black flag on you forever. Absolutely. For because of one person's decision. But I, so I think, uh, what I think the false part of bin Laden was just the, it was a Trump, he was a trumped up God. Like he like he was a one hit wonder nine 11 was his big hit and then the rest of the time it was, they just used the threat of him as a, an excuse to just get more power to the government. Um, there's a video on youtube called the last word on Osama bin Ladin that is so fucking enlightening as far as like how intertwined his family was with uh, oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:49:00       With the Bush administration, they built Mecca and all that. God, you guys watch the video. It's called the last word on Osama bin Ladin and it is so fascinating. It's about 15 minutes long and it goes into depth about there their there, the families were doing business together forever and this guy gave them visas to leave. They got them out of the country, out of the country. Wouldn't mind. One was like al Qaeda was not the threat. They claimed it was like since nine 11 out Kate is killed, I don't know, 300 civilians. And my point was more people have died at like six flags then that, but yet there's like we got an in and it's like, dude, they killed the, it's not, there's way bigger risk and that I'm off for like hunting them and, and, and law enforcement. The law enforcement part of it and the, but the war part is like, it's, there are a bunch of fucking, there's more crips than there are members of Alec.

Speaker 3:          00:49:55       Well not only that, they're on the other side of the planet and there's no way of disconnecting them and their history from the United States and the CIA. There's not, the mujahideen were being trained by the United States government to fight against the Soviet Union. I mean, that's just a fact. The whole Jihad thing, you know what Jihad used to be with the original meaning of it in, you know, the holy scriptures was, it was a war against your own personal vices. That was like a real jihad. What? But we turned it into a war, a holy war. And we turned the, the idea of suicide bombing was introduced by America.

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       I mean it was our idea that we brought to them, like you guys really got so much.

Speaker 6:          00:50:33       But, uh, there's a documentary again on Youtube, um, called, uh, the power of nightmares as a BBC thing. Yeah. A really good and it length like Christian evangelicals with a extremist Islam and, and how it was both born in the 50s and sort of sprung out. And I'm an eligible Hari who tried to, he was part of the people that killed Anwar Sadat and he got, they have footage of him in [inaudible] 79 [inaudible] in the leader of [inaudible] and he was in jail talking to TV. Um, but, uh, but yeah, I mean, yes. Is it an American? Uh, I don't think it's a American backed issue. I think a lot of it had to do with, with us just dumping Afghanistan after the Russians left. And I think that created a vacuum here. It comes to talent,

Speaker 1:          00:51:24       but there's also, you know, they realize how things really work once they start dealing with America. I mean that's the, the real cold hard situation of it. What's really fascinating was there was a recent video that was released from, someone leaked it from a Pentagon hearing where these guys are sitting around and it's a, a doctor and a scientist is explaining about the potential for developing vaccines to uh, to attack certain areas of the brain that are Cree or that are related to religious fanaticism. And they were showing like activity and different sectors of the brain. They can come up with this vaccine that could literally attack those areas and nullify these ridiculous a religious fanatic ideas.

Speaker 6:          00:52:06       I believe in my lifetime there will be a thing, a part of a brand like you will be able to set your brain to override negative impulses. I think so. I mean, like, I don't think it's the Scientology is about it. Is, is it? Well, yeah, but I'm saying like you'll be able to do it with a pill or some sort of implant or something where it's like it will override shitty impulse and then it'll be the decision. Do I want to override it? Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:52:31       well then this becomes what is shitty. You know, it's objective hordes of barbarian taken over your land. It's not shitty to hit somebody in the head with an ax. You know what it's like what you gotta do. Yeah. Well you'll have to go through preferences. The, my next door neighbor where I used to live, it was a nice guy. And, uh, he was a scientologist and I found out about the wolf. No, no, it was sort of a bit full. No, it was in Calabasas. It was a nice guy. But, uh, he was talking to me about this piece of property that it was looking to buy, but he couldn't because his wife was going clear. And so I go with it. What does that, what does that mean? And he goes, well, we're Scientologists. And then he pauses and looks at me, I'm like, Oh fuck, you know? Okay, well I want to be as accepting as possible. He's a nice guy. Yeah. I mean, look, my other neighbor was a Mormon and they were, they were nice too. I mean, I had no problem with you and your wacky religious ideas as long as you're a good neighbor.

Speaker 6:          00:53:22       And also don't try to proselytize. I don't do what ever you want, but don't,

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       absolutely. Don't try to sell me on. And he never did and neither did the Mormon. So they were all cool. Mormons are very, they don't really, they're like Jews. They don't want you to join, you know? So, um, so he starts telling me that his wife's going to be clear and it's going to cost $50,000. So I go $50,000. I go, what does this entail? He goes, well, you know, uh, basically the work is already done. And what this is, is sort of a confirmation in the ceremony to, uh, ensure that she is no longer affected by negative energy and negative influences. And that what this does becoming clear protects you from all negative influences and stimulation. And it's actually been proven that ceremony and then big events and even the donation of the large sum of money to, you know, accentuate some sort of a situation like this can actually help the results. So like this guy is weird pseudo scientific way of looking at this fucking,

Speaker 6:          00:54:17       there's a really good article. And then from the New Yorker, like two and a half months ago about Paul Haggis, who's a film director. But there was a really long piece about it cause he left. They're going on holiday. Yeah. They're going after him and it's, it's really personal and it's one of those New Yorker articles. It's just like, whew, this is long. But it's so worth it. And the recommend everyone read it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:38       The thing is, it's like, you know, they become the people to lower level people. They become like soldiers and they act out in the best interest of the church. And it's not just about, you know, it's like a gang. It's not just, I mean, all churches are man and it's right.

Speaker 6:          00:54:53       Find that. Yeah. The, uh, any, any, any group people, Steelers fans, absolutely. They just go like, this is for Roth Lisberger meanwhile, Rosberg with what? I would find that with Chappelle, there'd be all these guys around him like, Hey Dave, let me take care of this. It's like he doesn't want it, but if you're the person who it's being done on the, in the name of it's flattering.

Speaker 1:          00:55:15       It is flattering. But it's also, it's a weird tribal instinct that goes back to the time where there was, you know, 50 of us and we had to stay alive and stay in a group. We have these weird group instincts, you know? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:55:26       That's, I actually wrote a essay that I think I'm going to post later on today about please let us know and we'll tweet it. I would love that. You guys, what'd you do that for me? Um, about, uh, about the thing with Tracy Morgan saying that, you know, I'm all for like gay groups coming out against them because it is technically reprehensible. I got a couple of thoughts. One of the thoughts is, as Comedians were going to say, we have to talk a lot, we're going to say fucked up shit from time to time. The same way Nike or, or Levi's has an outlet store for irregular shit. We're going to say some irregular shit every once in a while. It's not fucking, it's just gonna. It's like the Don Imus thing. He has to talk 25 hours a week. He's nappy headed hoes is the only time that comes slipping out.

Speaker 6:          00:56:17       So my point with Tracy is, uh, I don't mind giggers coming out against him. Everybody else shut the fuck up because every single person on earth has some racism, sexism, some homophobia, some classes have some, uh, uh, uh, political, big, you know, uh, prejudices and, uh, and, and they think that by coming out against Tracy, it distanced themselves from them from, from their own sort of darker impulses. And it makes them seem like they're really doing something. Meanwhile, you're not doing shit. It's not. It's like I said, you know, all the people that, uh, all the media outlets that came on came down on Michael Richards. Are Black people better off today because of the fucking hammer? No, in fact, they're worse off. So if you want to help black people build a fucking school or a hospital and shut the fuck up,

Speaker 1:          00:57:11       I don't think, I think the Tracy Morgan thing is different from the Michael Richards thing for two reasons. One, because I think Michael Richards was talking to a group of people who are heckling him and he was trying to insult them in the most dehumanizing way possible. And he was on coke and he was trying to be funny when he didn't deserve May. Do you think he was not coping? He's pretty sure. I don't know. I'll prove me wrong. Okay. Just prove God. Uh, you know, he was at the comedy store before and by all accounts he was gacked out of his mind. I don't know if it's true or not. Maybe I'm a slandering him or whatever, but, uh, I don't think he's going to go after me for this. I think for this one, he's going to leave it alone. You don't think he wants to revisit this may call you the n word. At least you know he's willing to go. That was less offensive. And I think when, you know, if people want to, uh, get on him about that fucking magic word, that's ridiculous. When black people say to each other every fucking day of the week, I think when I looked at it, I was like, oh, well he shouldn't have done that. And that wasn't funny. But my other, my initial thought was, it's not, he doesn't deserve to be on stage. He shouldn't be on stage on a fucking Friday night factory.

Speaker 6:          00:58:12       Troll yourself to not, if you're under, if there's a chance that when you're getting heckled, you're going to yell that out.

Speaker 1:          00:58:18       He's not, well, he's a comedian. Yeah, exactly. He's a famous guy and he's going to go on after like Al Madrigal or you know, someone of that nature who is not a name, who's going to crush and you know, Tom Segura and then you're good luck. Good luck. Fall those guys. Yeah. And you're, you're some fucking slap sticky guy. If you ever seen what he does. No, he used to go onstage and the comedy store and he had no material. He would just fall down. He would go on stage. It's boy, he don't let fall down. I can't believe this was happening to me. I got a whole separate pair and he would slip again and fallen. It's back in my, this is my kind of comedy. Go on. Fucking ridiculous. I mean he would do it for like 1520 minutes, fall down all over the place. I don't think what he said is anything. I think what he said is just him being weak. But it would, Tracy Morgan said was like, Whoa, like you want to, if your son was gay you would stab that little nigger. But I think that that's, I think that what he's doing is just trying to be funny and I think he's probably ad libbing, which Tracy does for like most of it's set now. If you've ever seen Tracy Morgan do stand up, he'll start talking about eating pussy man.

Speaker 6:          00:59:18       Well it seems that lived. It's generally not ad Lib, but like I fuck a midget

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       and the mouth and like all that shit. So the idea is I'm a bit sad. Yeah, fine. Gay stabbing his son Shit was part of that. First of all, I'm sure that got a laugh and in the abs up stabbing your son for any reason. Is Bernie Mac called his nephew a faggot. Where was the outrage called him a faggot. Kings of comedy night, 2000 Sag. It didn't mean as much back then. It has escalated over the last, where are people going back and going like, and you Bernie Mac. It's like, okay. Again, I don't, if you want to help gay people, uh, give money to, to gay charities and, and, and, and uh, glad and going chastising Tracy isn't helping gay people hardly at all. It's helping them a little, but it's the bare minimum, absolute bare minimum. What people think. It's not, people think people go, it's better than nothing. It's, it's almost worse than nothing because at least nothing knows it's nothing, you know? Whereas this, it's like I'm, I'm look at me, I'm chastising Tracy.

Speaker 1:          01:00:26       Right. I agree. What you're saying in that when something like this happens, the people that make a big deal about it and talk about it and make press conferences, those are all concerns that that is just a fact. That's a fact in almost every situation. The people that are, you know, a lot of comedians on Twitter were coming out against it. I never liked her and it was just like silly few fucking pussies. It's just not, it's not a good point. It's not a well thought out point. It seems like you're taking a safe route. It doesn't take much. Like it's not much of a thought exercise to get where I got where it's like, well wouldn't you know, but to have an opinion about it. I think it's an interesting subject of debate. I think to have an opinion about it. I think there's going to be the non comics opinion and there's going to be the people that are, you know, sort of a bit more sympathetic because you know they'd realize that comics a lot of times you'll, you don't know what the fuck you're saying before you're saying it.

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       You're saying it on an impulse and what you would say in front of me, like if we were standing around, if we were sitting in my office and you and I said, well what about if you had a gay son? I need to like, I'll stab that little nigger. I would start laughing my fucking ass off. Well that's the end of Tracy Morgan was yes, there's two house. And guess what if you said that in front of a different crowd, you know, one crowd would fucking laugh hilariously, uh, 10 o'clock, late night show and Cleveland, you know, and well that only 50th

Speaker 5:          01:01:42       as comedians were supposed to have a shorter distance between our impulses and our words. That's why, that's part of what comedy is. And then when it goes awry, when there's an irregular common, people are like, fuck this guy, I'm going to fucking, it's like, Yo man, you gotta let us be a little, and I'm not saying I'm, I'm like, I'm trying to set myself up to say something fucked up. I just think if you're in the a aggrieved group, if you're the, if you're a, if, first of all, if you're Tracy's son, I would, I would boycott Tracy, um, or suck a dick and take a picture of it. Oh yeah. Look at that dad. Yeah. You look, I've known Tracy, as long as I've known you and Tracy dear, really think Tracy Morgan's can stab his son under any circumstances. First of all, do you think Tracy knows where his son is?

Speaker 5:          01:02:31       Actually, I actually heard a lot of those jokes were actually jokes that he's Hbo and nobody gave a fuck. C'Mon. Nannette Johnny Today on the podcast. And he said, Oh yeah, I've heard those jokes before. Really? So He's been saying that shit for a while. And then someone just had to stand up and complain about it. Yeah. Huh. That's people being terrible writing Tracy. I said, uh, well no, the thing that I said in my asset, my unpublished definite is that, uh, people think that B, the, I said the louder someone says I don't have a racist bone in my body, the less likely they are to have a black or Latin friend cause I have a shit load of black friends and I'm a racist. And guess what? My black friends have me as a friend and they're fucking racists and your racist and you're homophobic and you're sexist and you're anti, you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          01:03:21       Everybody's everything. So one guy said something like accidentally on a whim and everyone goes, I am not okay, stop. This is not a whim. This is, this is his material. Okay, fine. This is completely done. It's his material and now what's a different story? Well, you know, then someone, he's talked to him and tell him that shit's not funny because it's just, it's just silly. You know, if you're, if you're saying that every show funny, I've, Tracy was saying some shit that wasn't getting a laugh, he would stop saying it. You sure I'm positive? Sure wouldn't just try to rework positive. He might rework it for like three nights. You can't use the impulse thought though, you know, if it's his material. But even if it is material, if it wasn't working, he'd stopped doing it and things that clearly did not work the night he did it.

Speaker 5:          01:04:06       So now he's going to set up and everything I heard that was that he got in trouble recently in New York for doing something very similar and like it was like an a day or so. No one knew about it anymore, but this one just happened to come out. Right. This whole act is about being this wild, crazy fuck yeah, we don't want you to that crazy but fuck midgets in the blowhole or whatever the fuck his job. Like he talks about fucking a woman in her inner voice box. It's like, but every, but again, people are fine with that. That's absolutely fine because the voice box people, ironically enough, don't have a voice stabbing. No one people. So, but once you say stab me, then it's like, hey, hey, no, no one, no one there. You can't talk about that. Yeah, you can not, you can make a joke about somehow you can make that funny but, but just the idea that that somehow again, gay groups absolutely should, should boycott him but, but all these other for to use your word cunts, uh, can, can, can eat a dick because it's like let them, you don't, first of all your rate every, it's all these fucking white lightning deal saying that.

Speaker 5:          01:05:14       Why didn't you say that everyone is racist and everyone, it's tribal

Speaker 1:          01:05:19       racism. I mean are you really racist or do you just recognize the fact that some people and some ethnic groups do fucked up shit because you're aware of the news that doesn't make you racist.

Speaker 6:          01:05:29       Pattern recognize and you make assumptions based on a parents as human beings. That's what you do. I don't think that's racist, which is to say these fucking white, there's a reason why we like to say for the record, black people think. I think sometimes, I don't know if you have a big black viewership, but black people think that when they're not around, white people are like, so the niggers and did it, the amount of times that I've heard someone give a screed the way Mel Gibson did, I, I've never heard anything like that. Like I've never, white people are not like, so, all right, they're gone. Now look, can we talk about these darkies or, and I've never heard any of that. I've never have. Uh, so, so I would like to the presumption he did interesting Gibson, when he goes off, it's still going off. Uh, I had, uh, yeah, but so the idea that somehow, uh, it, the white liberals would say that it is racist to be presumptive to make any prejudicial, uh, decisions.

Speaker 1:          01:06:31       Well, you know what, that's, that's silliness because you should analyze, you know, a few, if you know that 99% of all Chinese men stab people and you see a Chinese guy, you're like, fuck, ob is a 1% or,

Speaker 6:          01:06:43       right. But again, yes, but but white liberals would say like how, what this ridiculous. He asked the guy and go, hey, you're not a stab, right? Oh No, no, no, no. That's not racist. Yes, everyone will admit to this, but you can't say it in any kind of public forum and I think that there is obviously a difference between what we're talking about and Tracy saying stabbing, stabbing his gay. What do you potentially gates on political correctness. Why is that shit still here is and why is, why are the words more important than the intent still? Well, that's what I said. It's like black people wouldn't, if you built a state of the art hospital in Harlem or a state of the art school in Harlem, you could call it nigger high and they'd be fine with it as long as they were great teachers there and fucking state of the art equipment and fucking yes, my son went to nigger high like they would really be really, I promise it does it all right. I'll say this for political correctness because I've seen it. It came really to, it came to full bloom in the early nineties. I think it is good in terms of it it like calling black people, African Americans. I think that it does. Uh, in some ways it's largely symbolic. It's almost entirely symbolic, but there was a five to 7% a range in which I think it is an effective, it does distinction. Yeah, it does make, I mean a homosexual is better than saying it fucking fag. You know, like there are words that, but is it better than

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       saying gay? More ennobling than others. Sexual better than saying gay a gay problem. One is African American better than saying black. I say black cause I don't cause African American sounds like my friends or dignitaries, whereas they're just dudes. Right. I always find it is strange. This is a strange word. African American. I've been saying, I've been saying nigger in my act and it's, it's, it's great. Go for it. You just do it on black routes. I did chocolate Sunday on Sunday, did great and I'm doing tripping on Tuesdays tonight. I'm going to go on and be in the back of the room with one knee bent and one foot in the launching position, like the starting blocks. My point isn't to run out of the room, hang out with black people. I get called it all the time. Right? You get called the time. So classic store hanging out with black guys, they say it back and forth and you're not supposed to say it.

Speaker 5:          01:09:06       It's almost like when you're like you're grounded and your brothers outside dancing in the yard like woo, you can't book and be on it. So, so, uh, so the bid is about like, I fucking, I mean I say I would write it on Chappelle show. I would, you know what I mean? Like I wasn't that an issue on the Chappelle show with comedy central. I mean never. I mean that was, no, I heard that. You guys know. Yeah. You know where you heard it from? From Dave's press junket. So it's not true. Well, we were the golden geese of comedy central or a license to print money for them. So when Dave was saying that they were telling him to stop saying, nigger, that was bullshit. Absolutely. Wow. Yeah. Holy Shit. I mean, again, in my experience that was, that was, well, I'm not going to say, here's the thing, I say one thing about Dave and he can go on Oprah and fucking trashed me. So like I gotta be careful, but, but that wasn't my experience at all. Why would he go on Oprah trash shoots he trashed me. Has, yeah. What happened? You guys had this, what will he, you know, we're doing the show popular show. You'd been on it a few times. It did wonders for your career. Um, and uh, and then

Speaker 6:          01:10:11       we were doing great. And then, uh, we renewed our contracts, which was extremely ugly comedy central play, divide and conquer between us, which I said they're going to do this cause they are gonna make, they're gonna they have to pay you. They don't want to have to pay me. The only way they're going to have to pay me as if you demand that they pay me. So what they did is they poisoned, uh, me in within Dave's mind and how they do this with this. Ah, like David said one time at wraparounds that he couldn't do the show without me at, during a taping. He said that, and I said that to comedy central. I was like, Hey, just so you know, Dave said he couldn't do the show without me. And so they called him and goes, you know, Neil says she can't do the show without him. And then he's like, motherfucker, so just becomes an ego thing.

Speaker 5:          01:11:00       Well, wait a minute, you guys didn't have the kind of relationship where he would call you up? We did prior to that, but

Speaker 6:          01:11:05       the negotiation started then it became like a, I can't talk to anybody, you know, really? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:11:11       It was the w let me, let me be clear with us.

Speaker 6:          01:11:14       It was the worst period of my life. I can't imagine the worst period.

Speaker 1:          01:11:18       And it's just because the stakes were so high. And then he was, became,

Speaker 6:          01:11:22       it became an ego thing and it just became like,

Speaker 1:          01:11:25       no, I can, I can accomplish as to what the scene on the set was. A, when we did a, the fear factor spoof and what it was, was Neil was running everything and Dave was in character all day running around, you know, uh, you know, I'm Rick James Bitch, and, and, and

Speaker 5:          01:11:41       I think that's an exaggeration, but it was, but you know, I mean, you had a huge part in that shows the point coke ran, or the shell, like it wasn't, that's the thing is like, but I think what happened was,

Speaker 6:          01:11:52       uh, you know, they made it seem like by David admitting that I was, Lorne Michaels once said in reference to me, and Dave Comedians don't like it when, when people realize they have help. And I think in Dave was the one who would say that I was out. Cause it was fair because it was only fair. He would have to say, Neil makes a big contribution to show, because I did, it was conversations with calmness, Shit. We said, whatever. Uh, but again, I, uh, contributed, I believe I held up my end of the bargain, but it just became this thing of like, they may, I think, I don't think they made, I think part of it was in him anyway, that he just resented the idea of being on a team. Really.

Speaker 1:          01:12:38       Yeah. And where did you draw this conclusion from? The Jews had a conversation with him about this. This is just, yeah. And what, what did he say?

Speaker 6:          01:12:46       Uh, we're not a fucking team.

Speaker 5:          01:12:48       Whoa. Whoa. That was after two years of the show. And this is

Speaker 6:          01:12:54       teams. We were a team when it, when it wasn't popular.

Speaker 5:          01:12:57       God Damn, that sucks. Yeah. Pain. I know. That's the thing is like, look, me and Dave are cool now and I don't,

Speaker 6:          01:13:05       I think that that's, uh, I'd like to think that this was all circumstantial. You know what I mean? Like in the circumstances, he was just under a lot of pressure and end. He felt like,

Speaker 5:          01:13:16       you know, the, the what you're saying, you know, the other thing

Speaker 6:          01:13:20       that I will say is that, is that in the, when me and Dave wrote half baked, I knew that people in comedy would all think, would think that he wrote all of it and people in show business would think that I wrote all of it because people in show business are predisposed to think that the black guys had dummy

Speaker 5:          01:13:39       all that shit. Dude. I would say to people, I swear to God, I was in a meeting with a producer and he, I promise you, he goes, seriously how much of that script to Dave, right. I prom and I was like, half of it, man. Have them. And sure enough, everyone in comedy thought Dave wrote it. Def Jeff Ross referred to me as Dave Chappelle's typist. Okay. Does Jeff Frosto? Well, I mean he's the roast master general, but that's a little bit beyond the Pale. That wasn't it. It wasn't that a row rude. Especially if the guy doesn't update exact very often by himself. Um, yeah. Um, uh, Jeff, if any writers are listening. When I was younger, I would, uh, most certainly had a problem with working with a garden and then having to reveal the fact that this guy was writing half of my material again.

Speaker 5:          01:14:27       But the idea of Hap, it's not, there's so much work on, on doing a TV show, it's just, it's a lot. I did a lot of work. Here's the other thing, Dave did a fuck load of work too. And Dave is a hall of fame, one in a billion comedian. I honestly do that. Like one of the billion. There's like Eddie Murphy, him, Chris in terms of like, I don't, I think he's very different than any Murphy I think. No, no, but I'm saying in terms of the decathlon of ability, Dave can do stand up, he can write sketches, he can think of characters, he can write movies, he can, he's got a visual sense like he's got, he's got the full, uh, a portfolio. So the idea that that, uh, you know, he didn't like, I don't want to come on here and be like, Dave, Dave Chappelle, you know, doesn't exist.

Speaker 5:          01:15:15       That's not the truth. The truth is, well, you're talking about a god that cracked under pressure. It's all right. It's not like he sucks. He's still one of the greatest comics I knew. So I knew early on in 97 that people were going to give me too much credit or him too much credit. So we had a deal. We don't tell people who wrote what, like how to deal sat down and came up with the deal. The idea was that we didn't hammer it out or anything, but I can deal with it was my idea because I knew that if, if I, if, if he'd heard that I said I wrote something, he'd be pissed. And uh, if I heard that, um, he wrote like if it just, it doesn't serve the team. When people ask who wrote that joke, they don't, they don't have, they don't have your best interests at hearts.

Speaker 5:          01:16:02       They basically saying they're like, they're going, where's the one of you two? Can I discount because this hurts my feelings. I think it's a good quality of this hurts my feelings. So they want to find out who I want to find out who stinks. And he's funny. That's interesting. Like, and, and so I recognized that immediately. And so, so we, so, but having said that on true, because you know, that's the Matt Stone Trey Parker thing. Everybody who said Trey Parker writes everything. Matt stone just sits from jerks off many times. You heard that? That's why they say that because South Park's the greatest fucking show that's ever existed and it's fully good. Yeah. It hurts people who aren't producing Matt around cause he hates money. Gray hates money. He just wants to give out. It's like, God, I can't take, oh, I fucking hate this money. Uh, so the idea that somehow, uh, he didn't, he didn't like the idea of the implication that, that um, uh, the white people would think that I was doing it. All people would say shit like we'd be, we were somewhere and, and one of his agents

Speaker 6:          01:17:10       came up. It's like the genius behind the man to me standing next to Dave. Now I know the agent is just trying to be a fucking agent and be like schmoozy. Right. But it's like, Yo man, don't say that shit first of all because it's not true. And secondly, because it fucks, it poisons our relationship, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:17:30       Hmm. Um, wow. There's a lot of ego going on here. Uh, there's a, uh, yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:17:37       yeah. A lot of ego get into show business for, for attention. Like, you know, for personal attention.

Speaker 1:          01:17:43       It's some point though. The idea is to steer it towards the work, right. To steer that energy into instead of it being personal tension. The real satisfaction is creating something that's really good.

Speaker 6:          01:17:53       People love and passionate response and people still love it. But that's the, but the thing is if you're surrounded by people, you know, there was a, there've been some studies where they, where they said, what is, uh, they, they, they put people in a situation, a bunch of volunteers in situation, and they asked another group of volunteers, what do you think these people will do and why? And they, they said they are going to do the negative thing because they're all dicks. So they, the people did the thing, people devolve this group did the thing over here and they all did the negative thing. And these people said, yeah, cause their dicks and then they put these people in it and they did the exact same thing. Not because their debts. It's because as a human being in that situation, you're going to do the thing. People don't know how they're going to react in certain situations. And most of the time it is circumstantial. It's not characterological. And that's the thing with this is I think, uh, if I, if I had been Dave, it's very easy for me to say I would have treated Neil differently. But again, you know, or, but I wasn't dating

Speaker 1:          01:18:58       circumstances, exposed character though. I mean that is the idea of character in the first place. The idea of character is strong, character is able to survive under adversity and that's what it's all about. And that's why when someone doesn't have your back, when the shit hits the fan, you lose respect for them because you're like, well, this person has enough character. This person is not my friend. You know, this person is looking out for themselves. They're weak, they're egotistical, they're whatever. They have a flaw.

Speaker 6:          01:19:21       Yeah, he'll, he'll bury me for this by the way. Really? Oh, do you know on this conversation? Absolutely. Really? I mean, I would bet my bet.

Speaker 1:          01:19:28       So you're feeling bad right now that you said anything? I don't feel bad.

Speaker 6:          01:19:31       I mean, I, I actually don't feel like I've said anything bad and I think I've been sympathetic. I mean, but no one here. The thing that was so disgusting about the whole thing was nobody asked me my side of things, 60 minutes called and I wouldn't do an interview in New York Times called I wouldn't do an interview.

Speaker 1:          01:19:46       Well explain to everybody how it all went south. So you guys were in negotiations, you're about, everybody heard the number 50 million. That's what I keep hearing. $50 million are going to make another season for $50 million deal. And then Dave goes to Africa,

Speaker 6:          01:19:59       right? What, what, what exactly went down. But what happened was the, there was the negotiation part, the divide and conquer thing that I already talked about about them going, you know Neil. So then he can do it without them. You can't do it without them. So which would make Chappelle like, Fuck Neil, you're basically comedy central. You're deputized to low ball him even though, I mean he never, I don't think that was ever explicitly said. But if they say like they came to him at one point and like could you do the show without Neil? And He, and they had poisoned me to him so much by that point that he was like, yeah, but it would take three people.

Speaker 4:          01:20:32       Could you have decided to get together and form a partnership in the form of some sort of a corporation and say this corporation is what you are contracting to do this television show and the fee for the corporation will be X. Right. But there was all guys, Ben and some sort of illegal things, so you don't have to worry about this ever again. I couldn't have been done that could have been done ahead of time, but I'm not, we're not a fucking team. Keeps that shit from happening. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:20:58       Um, so, so, so yeah. So at that point, uh, they was the divide and conquer thing and, and, and so, all right. Yeah. So that, so our relationship was pretty much once my deal was closed,

Speaker 4:          01:21:14       you couldn't call him and go, Yo dude, this is, eventually I did. And eventually, literally were on the both on the phone. I'm crying and I think he may get out of my house right now. Joe, this is how Whiz, what a bitch I am. Uh, it's Tracy Morgan would stab me right now. Um, uh, so a cook a steak for you after this is over and Ah, no, I'm crying. Chappelle may have been crying. He was definitely tearing up because on the phone. Yeah. How'd he know he's tearing up on the phone. You can visit hope vocally. You guys on Skype. We were on a I chat.

Speaker 6:          01:21:50       Um, and uh, and it was basically like, dude, like what are you doing? Like, and then, and then, so finally it was, I basically said like, why are you doing this? Like, what did I, you do your deals closed. But they made basically his deal was closed, right. Bunch of money. Uh, and then my deal was open, but they made it somehow seem to, Dave, like any point for me was a point against him. And it wasn't the case, but I think,

Speaker 4:          01:22:21       and so they were letting him know there's only a certain amount of money.

Speaker 6:          01:22:25       They knew they weren't, they never said like, you're going to get less money if Neil gets more. Dave Steele was close. It was just the idea that like they didn't want, it was like they planted in Dave's sort of psyche that he didn't, or maybe it was already in there, he didn't want me to get in too close in terms of compensation. They made it about an ego thing. Like, well, how much does Neil [inaudible] Neil worth? You know? Uh, so they were basically deputized to low ball me.

Speaker 4:          01:22:55       Well, typically show runners get, you know, almost as much money as the stars of shows. I mean, you look in terms of like this fucking guy with this chuck Lorre Guy, Charlie Sheen, you know, everybody's talking about Charlie Sheen making $2 million an episode. Guess what? That chuck Lorre guy probably makes more secular, would kill himself. He was making 2 million and up. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:23:12       Uh, Chuck Lorre, he's done a lot of big shows and it wasn't cast contingent and all that. Like Dave brought me on. Right. You know, so I couldn't really go like, fuck you. And the other thing is I can't just go do the show with like, I'm going to get fucking Orlando Jones and do that. It's not, and I, nor did I want it. That was the thing is the thing that about me and Dave was like, I love the dude. You know what I mean? Like I like a door. The dude, I love writing with them. I love writing. I love, like, I would work like fucking a crazy, I worked, I told my brother this the other day because I'd forgotten. I worked one day, there was a, there was a period where I worked for 12, at least 12 hours a day for 35 straight days to try to, just to get the show done, to get the show on the air. Um, he was working his ass off too, but it was just the idea that somehow, uh, they just made it about like pitting us against.

Speaker 4:          01:24:07       Okay. So for those nation go crazy. They pitted you against him. You guys wound up fighting. How did you never resolve it? How did you never talked to him?

Speaker 6:          01:24:17       We've resolved it, but it was still this thing of like, when push comes to shove, you don't want to be in a fucking team. Uh, you don't think I'm, you think I'm fractionally worthwhile of the show? Uh, it was just kind of a vote of like, fine. It was just this resentment of like that I was getting this, this, that I got some money to do. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:24:43       Well I don't understand that. If he thinks that you guys are a team and it didn't affect how much you were a teen, but he knows that you guys work together to do the fucking show.

Speaker 6:          01:24:54       Right?

Speaker 4:          01:24:56       You're basically saying that it was completely an ego thing on his part. That's what you're saying. You're saying that he didn't feel like you were worth as much as him. He didn't feel like you're working. Contribution was, like I said, he's a one in a billion guy. Like he's, uh, he's, uh, he deserved more money than okay. That, that said he already had his money, so he was already getting a certain amount of money. So what, what, what you're saying basically is completely different than anything anyone's ever heard in the news. No kidding. Cause no one's ever asked me, God, this is so crazy. So my point of view from all this time, it was greatest show in my opinion, greatest comedy show of all time, Chappelle show number one, greatest show of all time. That fucking Clayton Bigsby character, that's the greatest sketch in all of television, black racists

Speaker 6:          01:25:40       self idea. Like he had been, he'd had it in the heat and it's a brilliant, brilliant still remember writing the sketch. It's a brilliant, I remember call, yeah, I won't say who wrote.

Speaker 4:          01:25:49       So what I had heard was that there was all sorts of input from the network and they were saying him that he used to stop saying nigger and make it more friendly to commercials. This side, I don't remember where it heard this or you might want to be second. There was a lot of stories

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       and that he, because he left the show and then I think he had to figure out a way to make himself look like the victim, but in my estimation he wasn't the victim. Wow. Um, again, no one wants to hear it again. He's like, he's an unbelievably charming guy. Hilarious. He's everybody's friend. Like I get it. He's, he was my for, he's still living. We're still friendly. Like we're friends. We weren't for like three, four years, but now we're friendly and hang out when he's in La. Let me ask you this man, why, why doesn't he do like fucking concerts and theaters and put out DVDs? I mean everybody's so excited to see him do standup, but like you know, you never hear about it until he like shows up. Lee Thomas show. Yeah. I'll show up at the store. He'll show up, showed up in Seattle and was doing shows in a park with a speaker.

Speaker 3:          01:26:52       He pulled out a microphone and a speaker and plugged it in and just doing shows like outdoors and I saw, I'm like about a month and a half ago and it was just him on stage and he was kind of fucking, it felt like he was fucking around. He wasn't like doing bits, but then I was told that no, that's his new style where he just does a lot of audience interaction. It's almost like a, an evening with, yeah, it was cool because you know what you're like. Okay. Really? I mean, again, the guy can channel Shit, like he can just stand in there and he's, he's riveting. I saw Dave do a street performance in Montreal. He did a standup comedy on the street. And what he would do was, uh, you know, we were doing these shows at club soda and then after the show he goes downstairs and shit, man. He was like, I don't know, 19 or something like that. And he goes downstairs and there's a group of people and so he just starts yelling, gathered around, gathered around lazy. Yeah. That was when one of the period we met and I started doing friends for like, I invited on the show to him, finding him on the podcast so we could get him in here and wait, wait for him. I think he'll be here any minute, dude.

Speaker 3:          01:27:59       Hey, it's day. Um, I, this is, this is very disturbing. Uh, I mean, again, all I've ever said about it, it was very like behind the music. How come he's not doing shows? Do you have any idea? I don't know. It's like, it's not advertising your shows. It's weird. I mean he's selling out everywhere. I mean he does shows every once in a while for like no DVDs. No, you know, I want to see the shakes. You know I having a contract and having to be someplace and I have a copy of Dave Chappelle when he got back from Africa. He, he did a set at a comedy club and I have a copy of that on MP3 and it's really weird as you make the copy, I don't know want to talk about it but I like I boot like staying home a month ago really cause I that he does a bit about doctor drew and I had to play it for someone. It's like you had about doctor drew just about piece of Charlatan. He is fun. He's a whore. Yeah. Dr Jews purely. I'm all completely anti Dr drew now. I mean he's a nice guy. When I see him I'll say hi, I'll be his friend. But he started doing this stupid

Speaker 1:          01:29:01       shit on a CNN show about pot having severe withdrawal symptoms and that the THC is in a higher content today, which is physiologically a fucking ridiculous thing for a doctor to say because since it's not physically addictive, just because there's more THC does not make it addictive. You know, it doesn't, it doesn't all of a sudden change the properties of the fucking drug, you know, and anything where it's addictive at all, it's psychologically addictive, which by the way, anything can be psychologically addictive. You know, it's like saying, well we need to take away porn because porn psychologically addictive, no more gambling because some people can't handle it. Fat Foods, fatty foods, no more cheeseburgers. Cause some people get addicted to fatty foods. It's like fuck that. That's the, that's nonsense. Talking only like half the country gets addicted to fatty foods. Those were fucking idiots. You know?

Speaker 1:          01:29:42       I agree. That's evolutionary. I'm with you. I'm not into nerf in the world. And so his, his proposition that marijuana, you know, should, it is dangerous and illegal or should be illegal, it's fucking completely ridiculous thing to stay. Especially when he, you know, pharmaceutical companies are producing shit that's 100,000 times worse and it's available everywhere. It's a stupid, ridiculous thing for a doctor to say it's a terrible position for a Dr site and it's ignorant, you know? And the only reason why he's saying it is because he thinks that that's what the people who listen to him want to hear. He's a whore. That whore behavior.

Speaker 6:          01:30:12       I used to love him on in though. I thought it was really informative and helpful and I just feel like it's, at a certain point it's like, dude, you're just, uh, you, you want to be famous for everybody else.

Speaker 1:          01:30:21       Exactly. Yeah. He's, he's working hard for fame. It's like his fucking show. It's the most ridiculous thing. The idea that he's really helping those celebrities to get clean, you know? I mean, come on, man, you got a fucking camera in their face. It's the worst possible scenario for someone to try to clean up. They give them attention and the end of their career, when everything's fucking completely falling apart, you're going to give them attention and put a camera on them. Whether weeping and shaking and pissing their pants, and they should make it like a, whoever remains the sober the longest gets some kind of money. Yeah. That's what it should pay, right? Yeah. Let's make it a game show. Yeah. That's a good idea. What is, um, what does Stan hope spit? What does he say about him? Do you mind? I think I have on my phone.

Speaker 6:          01:31:02       Yeah. I had such a good bit. It's like such an, uh, it's, uh, it, it was a crazy good bit. Um, so, uh, whatever, I, I, they would take me forever is fine. Right. But were you still involved with Chappelle? The Chappelle show had like that kind of wrap up show and stuff like that? Yeah, cause I liked the sketches. Yeah. Dave wrote this sketches together. So then it became this thing of like, it was, it was, uh, and again, like I, I don't want people to think that I'm a dick or Dave's a dick. I just, it was a, it was a, it was a stressful situation. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:31:38       you, so you were involved with the season that he was involved in, which was like he, he was, he was, we wrote the sketch together, but he wasn't involved in putting it on the air

Speaker 6:          01:31:48       was not involved in putting them on the air. Yeah. Did he not want it on the air? Uh, I think his perception in my, my feeling about it was his perception of what was, uh, recorded. No perception of what was relevant or, or what was, what was, it's what's right, windows racial become racist and, um, and just got sort of blurred and I don't think he could see the difference between,

Speaker 1:          01:32:25       so he thought some of this stuff was racist. It's not a racial,

Speaker 6:          01:32:28       and it was based on completely random random. Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:32:32       so what you basically saying is that the pressure of this show over two years was so intense and that so many things happened and there was so much going on that he kind of cracked a little, which is what a lot of people thought when he moved to [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          01:32:45       I mean when he went to Africa, uh, is, is, is, I don't know, again, I don't, I don't presume to know what it's like to be a, a famous black comedian. Uh, it like it because the thing that black eyes, black comedians get that white people don't is you become a symbol. You know what I mean? Like you become the elect the spokesman. So people on news shows start going like, well, I saw Dave Chappelle show that you can do today. I saw that a thousand times when people, it became this thing, it became bigger than the intention where it's, the intention was like this little, this show that was almost just to make each other laugh and then it became this big thing. It became like this bully pulpit and, and so it, it became, it was so much responsibility I think for David. He actually, it stopped being fun because it wasn't like it wasn't, it was, it was the idea of like he said on 60 minutes like dance, like nobody's watching.

Speaker 6:          01:33:42       And then it became like dance, like fucking way too many people are watching. And, and I think it got in his head about about, is this responsible or is this, which again, as a white person, you just don't have to worry about, no one's going to go. You don't, you're never going to be the spokesman for white people ever. Do you hear me? Um, if you keep this up, uh, no. Like you just can't, you'll never, so that's the thing that as a, I think as a, as a black comedian, it's just, it's like Eddie Murphy, The Times I've spoken to him and hung out with them is still still seems upset by the fact that, that he got like picketed, you know? Yeah. He's like, man, if fucking, I'm just doing jokes. And then next thing I know I got people outside picketing. It's like, well, yeah, but you're doing dice. Obviously dice had the same thing. So it's not just racial, but

Speaker 1:          01:34:33       it's your PR. It's the perceptions that you're, you're, you're, you're very influential. And when you're on stage and you're saying a bunch of really negative shit about black people. I mean, Eddie Murphy said a lot of really mean shit about black people. You know, people you mean? Yeah. Excuse me. Gay People. So it wasn't, it wasn't, um, it wasn't just, you know, he was doing jokes. It was, you know, the jokes were really nasty.

Speaker 6:          01:34:54       Yeah, no, I'm with you. I like, I don't like all the Ilab but, but, um, but having heard that, I just want to say that Eddie is an awesome dude. Yes. Yeah. Great guy to hang out with, to talk to. Hilarious. Um, but uh, but so the eye are just jokes, but they are just jokes. I mean, but again, if you're doing jokes in a club with a hundred people, it doesn't take on that mom mentality. Whereas when you're in fucking Nassau Coliseum, you started to go, oh wait, this is almost too much, uh, influence over people. It's, it's one thing when it's a club, but when it becomes this big like, hmm,

Speaker 4:          01:35:28       what next? We had Brian Posehn on yesterday and he was talking about the gathering of the Juggalos. He's doing standup at the gathering of the Juggalos. And I thought about it after you left. I got baked and I was writing and I was thinking, you know, it'd be cool if we had some fucking crazy death squad meeting somewhere cause I know Stan hope did some shit like that. Like you had these parties in the desert but it was really just like a loser festival. Yeah. It became a bad idea but doing some one crazy event every year, you know, something like that. But that's when things get dangerous when things get dangerous is when you have like a movement behind you and then you have a logo and shit. Yeah. It's very difficult to fucking keep your, your, your interest pure.

Speaker 6:          01:36:05       It's also, yeah, it's hard to uh, it's it, yeah. It's, you kind of go, wait, what? What am I doing? It becomes this corporation. It just becomes like this, like a corporation and fucking a lot of you meet with lawyers more than you meet with the writers. You know what I mean? Like, that's the thing, part of it that's,

Speaker 4:          01:36:24       that's perceived of managed it fine. Oh, here we go to you. Do you have a huge issue with the Oprah like Oprah?

Speaker 6:          01:36:31       Yeah, I do. I know you don't like hope. No. She had Dave on. He's trashing me. No one from our CEO calls me. She doesn't have for my side of things. No one warns me. No. And then she, but she's this like great humanist.

Speaker 4:          01:36:45       Well, in her defense, I mean, is she going to have another show where you can at least tell me or at least happening? How does she have any idea that you were going to get trashed on the show? She knows that she had Dave on, he had it in the can for weeks. Right. But what are they going to tell you that the day of trashed? You really think, why would they email me something? Really? Yeah. I don't worry if you're going to have someone telling you

Speaker 6:          01:37:09       retelling a story, it's like, have both people on,

Speaker 4:          01:37:12       I wouldn't expect that. Um, I would think, you know, here's the famous guy. Let's see what he's got to take. No, it's, you know, we're friends. If he goes on Oprah, I'm sure we'll see nice things. Then I'd like Oprah. Well, that's what you think until two weeks later. And if he doesn't, uh, you know, I'll write something online, but I can't believe you said that. And this is the reality and the fourth, the Douche bag and

Speaker 6:          01:37:33       thanks to you, by the way, I don't know. I'm guessing I'm going to have to blame you for it. Now on Twitter where it says similar to you, Oprah,

Speaker 4:          01:37:39       the whole file comes up now has to be because of you. Because I like about Oprah. I think she is a positive voice to people like her. She's a positive voice to older women. She gives him something to look forward to. She has this fanatical following of likeminded people in her message is essentially positive. Her messages of life improvement and of dietary improvement and behavioral improvement or messages of spreading love. She's nothing like me. There's nothing about her. I bet she probably hates everything I've ever done of every outside of news radio. She likes your MMA. I bet she hates UFC. I bet she hates fear factor out of, but it's all good. I'm very different human being than she is. But I recognize that as a human being who she is is uh, very beneficial and very important to people like her. I like, I like it.

Speaker 4:          01:38:28       Game recognizes game son. She's positive. Yeah, I think she's a fucking ego maniacal. Well she, me, she might be. I had a friend who works for and he painted a very different picture of her. Uh, then, uh, you know, you see of her on her show when she's being interviewed by likeminded people. But my friend who interviewed her is kind of a cunt and he likes to start arguments and I bet he would have a real hard time working for some powerful woman. And I said, I assume that that's probably what happened. You know, he got stupid with her because he used to get stupid with me when we worked together. So I'm assuming with her it was probably even grocer, you know? I mean, I just did the math, but you know, I mean, yeah, I mean, I don't know. I just, you don't like her because of your own personal, but I didn't like it before that.

Speaker 4:          01:39:09       What didn't you like about it before that? She's an ego maniacal phone. It's all [inaudible] Oprah. She doesn't give a play. It's like the last week where there people on her farewell shows where there's tea, there's uh, people are gathered around to honor this woman that they've made a billionaire. Like thank you for letting us make you a billionaire. And she likes fucking like this. Like a fucking like a queen or something. Okay. But how would she have handled it? How, what's the other way to handle it? Came out and start flicking them all. Just say good night. Do a final show. Well, you know, maybe she wanted to give them the chance to say thank you and she wanted to give herself a chance to thank them. Why didn't Johnny Carson do that? Why did Johnny Carson smoked five packs of cigarettes a day and dive a fucking magazines because he's a bad ass.

Speaker 4:          01:39:57       You ever see the pictures of him when he's about to die? I'll never forget these photos. They had them in like star magazine or one of those things. He had this giant gut, like he swallowed a basketball and he was smoking like call malls and he was just insanely unhealthy when he died. It's amazing when you think of a guy who was that loved by so many people was so fucking miserable, so miserable. Uh, yeah. You ever hear Wayne Newton talk about them? No. Wayne Newton talking about Johnny Carson is the most hilarious shit cause Johnny Carson, we should tell jokes about Wayne Newton and his shit on Wayne noon and Wayne Newton was, you know, he's a fucking ego maniac and he couldn't take it. So apparently like he confronted Johnny Carson and grabbed him at, threatened them and said he was going to kick his ass and yeah, that's pretty funny. Anyway, Johnny Carson's stopped doing it and like flew in to see him. Yeah, it was pretty funny. I wonder if it's true though. Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean Newton might've said that he threatened him. He might've gotten in there and so you stopped telling the drugs by me and Johnny one kicked this fucking guy out of here. They probably pull the bed.

Speaker 6:          01:40:54       What I like about you and your toughness is that you don't, uh, you're so physically threatening that you don't, you just, the parameters with you are very clear. Whereas I think with, I just, I ate, we'll never get to violence with you, but I liked it if you just said like, Hey, would you stop doing jokes about me? People would just do it.

Speaker 1:          01:41:17       Yeah. I don't think anybody's really worried about physical violence in this day and age, you know, not from someone kicking their ass. This is so much at stake and so much to even pretend that you would do that. Like, you know, I'm going to go kick some of these asks cause they told jokes about you. That's silly. I'm not, I don't think that way ever. My, you know, I've never been one who's into getting in fights. Never. Even when I was young, I just, I think it's dangerous and scary and I've seen too many people get fucked up. I just been into martial arts and so I was a kid because I have terrible primate, savage instincts and I'm trying to curb every fucking step of the way I'm doing it to try not to fuck people up. I'm doing it. Sure. I try to not get angry, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:41:56       Uh, no, that's good. But that, that was what the thing with you and Carlos, that was what your size, uh, made it, it kind of took that off the table. Like you couldn't be like fuck you and fight you. It just, and I also think, and that's, I don't know if you remember when I gave you $20 a few weeks after it cause I just thought you deserve, you deserve recompense for what you did. But I think that you're the only one who ever did that. That video, that video made it, uh, made joke thievery and unacceptable. And I think that that Carlos, his career has suffered as a result of the video because it just made, it made something that was a behind the scenes and only communities, you know, and it made it put it in the public eye.

Speaker 1:          01:42:42       Well it's also because of Brian. Brian is wanting to edit it and edit it the way he edited it and made it so entertaining news 10 fucking minutes long, listen to 10 minutes of that nonsense. This argument back and forth between two comedians. It would have been really boring and it probably would've gotten not a fraction of the hits. He made it so interesting because he had all these other people saying that see mencias steel's material and going back in time and you know, and, and you know, switching the time and that you know, where you go in the past and then the future and you know, going back and forth. He made it really fascinating to watch. That was

Speaker 3:          01:43:13       what's, what's the luxury about that whole thing that happened is actually I had been doing my research about the guy wait beforehand and I actually had made a prior video that you did your doctoral thesis? Yeah. Yeah. I mean I was waiting for a day like this to happen and it all like pretty much Bates the first time I ever met him. Like he like stopped and it like went shoulder to shoulder with me. He looked at me and did that chicken neck thing where he's like, like that kind of like to make me flinch or something like that can get out of my way, get out of my way. And I'm like, really? Okay. Are you, were you hanging out at the comedy store talking to Duncan Trussell and uh, he's a cunt, you know, it's weird.

Speaker 1:          01:43:49       He was a real problem, you know, there, I've never been in a situation like that where you really realize how the business is structured and that no agents gave a fuck. No club owners gave a fuck. Everybody knew he was stealing shit and they kept using him because he was putting asses in seats. And it was so shocking to watch everybody turn a blind eye to him cannibalizing old Richard Pryor seat.

Speaker 6:          01:44:12       Right as you went around those people to the audience and said, Hey, are you both did and said, hey, this is what's actually happening. And the people have since spoken with fewer asses in seats.

Speaker 1:          01:44:25       Well you can also read his Twitter and you realize how fucking crazy he really is and watch his little Facebook videos that he puts out. Then you get to see the real human being. Now behind this facade of being a fake Mexican and now being the number one Latino comic, you know, but the reality is the Latino market is fucking gigantic and they were looking for a superstar. And so Mitzi shore said, hey, why don't you change your name to Mexican? So she made him become this phase. Actual name was Carlos Mexican. That was Mitsis ideas. Name's Ned. That's a stranger.

Speaker 6:          01:44:56       Yeah, but not that I really liked that in that it made people more aware of joke thieves and it made it, it's people, there was another like confrontation like a month ago,

Speaker 1:          01:45:08       guys material, which was excellent. Yeah. I didn't see it, but uh, I, I heard it's pretty good. I don't want to even, I, I'm so connected to that world. It's like I avoid led. Yes. That world plagiarism and exposing plagiarism. Like I don't want to, I just don't enough already. I've said more than enough negative shit about it. It was a, an issue that had to be dealt with and an issue unlike any people bring up all these arguments about parallel thinking and you're absolutely right. I've had jokes that I thought, I know I wrote. I know I wrote. Yeah. And then I'll watch some fucking HBO special from 1984. And it's like basically the same premise. Here's a perfect example. Yesterday we were talking about a racist about if dolphins could talk and we were talking about they, cause they came up with a machine to decipher dolphin language. Right. And then I said, uh, that we would have the first words were I hate Jews. You know, and then we, I was watching a clip, somebody posted on the message board, you guys did a bit of a Chappelle show were racist Dolphin and here the nigger hating dolphin. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:46:09       I'm here to reclaim that bit from you Joe. I did a bit, uh, I was doing it for like three weeks. It was killing so hard that I had to, I had to close with it cause it was just killing so hard. Uh, and then about three weeks into doing it, Jim Norton goes, Hey Jim Florentine used to do with that bit. Fuck. So then I see Florentine and he's like, I did it 15 years ago and he's like, you should do it. And I was Kinda like, I can't. Yeah, it's, it sucks cause it's one of those things it's like, ah fuck. It was such a good, and I know I wrote it like I, cause I remember Joe,

Speaker 1:          01:46:45       I work with this kid in Vegas and he was doing bits off my old, my CD from 1999 he did three bits. Yeah. Just reworked them and changed them. So a few years back our, he couldn't make it. And Anyway, long story. Uh, so I was like, you know, do I even say, I mean I'm not doing any of this stuff anymore. I don't do it anymore, but God damn dude, I mean you're going on right in front of me and you're redoing my own, my old fucking material. Did you say anything? No, no. He was so terrible. It was like, you know, I'm never going to run with this guy again anyway. The odds are know. Yeah, it was. But you know, when you have a bit that, you know, you found out that someone, you know, George Carlin did 20 years ago, you got to let it go.

Speaker 6:          01:47:22       Yeah. I mean, but there are bits that I've written that that recently that like someone else and it's Kinda like I don't fucking, and then you get into what day

Speaker 1:          01:47:32       did you write it? Well, you know it's a tweet. Everything. There's certain things like the news stories when things happen that it's unavoidable. When you know the Mel Gibson arrest happened unavoidable, there's going to be some similar shit. You know when you're talking about Charlie Sheen is going to be some similar shit, but when it comes to like, you know a a bit that's like really like a signature premise. I've had this issue with a couple of friends where I was like, dude, you've got to drop that bit. You know, that's this guy that's like real similar to this. It's been, I've heard it before and they go, yeah, I don't think it's that similar. I'm like, look, you're going to do it. What are you going to do it? You're going to be this unoriginal guy, man. You someone in the audience, you're going to be out there on stage and you must know that there's 300 people out there. Someone knows that there's another guy who does that bit, at least one, maybe one person for me, I can't do it for me. I can't do that bit. Now if you can do that bit to me that says something about you artistically, that you're, you're, you got some low standards, you know, and that you're willing to compromise to come up with new material, which is like really close to stealing.

Speaker 6:          01:48:25       It's like, yeah, that's one of those things. It's a bit of a, that's like, that's a, how do you live with yourself?

Speaker 1:          01:48:30       Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It sucks man. But sometimes you've got to let things go. I mean, it is sometimes, you know, someone will say, Oh, this guy has a bit just like that. And then he'd go, oh no, he doesn't. You listen to it and it's like a similar premise, but you went in a totally different direction with it.

Speaker 6:          01:48:43       Yeah. Some kid accused me, I did, I wrote something on Twitter like two months ago and some kid was like, zs. Aziz Ansari did that bit on fucking his special. And I was like, I know. How do you think I got the idea?

Speaker 1:          01:48:59       Well, we were making fun of m a r Kelly's video, real talk, which I watched again after a year. I haven't seen it either. Video. I have a song memorized. See the video, the videos. It's one of the greatest videos. Milton. Milton. Milton. Yeah. He's trying to, Milton's at the end of the fighting, they stop the fight or flight. It goes bogus girl. Yeah. Bitch. I wish you fun clothes. And so, uh, we were making fun of it on the podcast and someone tweets me. Yeah. Aziz [inaudible] already mixed fun of it. I'm writing. No, he doesn't know that. Sorry. You don't get to own one of the greatest fucking unintentional pieces of comedy ever. I don't care if he makes fun of it. I haven't seen him make fun of it. I'm sure he does. I know he does. An r Kelly bit. You don't own make it fun to r Kelly. That's like owning making fun of Michael Jackson or make it fun to Shaquille O'neil. You don't, yeah. You don't make your own. You don't own making fun of something ridiculous. Yeah. So there's that. I see that. But man, when you find a joke that you know that used to be on some fucking Richard Pryor CD, you gotta let that job.

Speaker 5:          01:49:59       Yeah. It's hard. I mean even cause I have a good memory for jokes so it becomes like a, it becomes a hard, but I guess it just forced you to be

Speaker 1:          01:50:08       more original. That's when I knew him and see was a thief. There was a first thing that he ever did where it really popped a red flag back when we were friends is he did a bit about a Ufo landing in the hood and that's like some old negatives or steal that shit. You know, thinking about stealing the Ufo from the aliens.

Speaker 5:          01:50:27       Chappelle did a joke when he was in high school that if alf came to his neighborhood, uh, a week later you'd see a nigger in an alf skin coat and he was like 15. That was your body. That's fine. Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So Carl, so you really, yeah. You just kind of go, ah, yeah. Makes you not really want to get a drink with them after.

Speaker 1:          01:50:51       Well, it made me, made me like tell him and then I told him, he said, no, I've been doing that bit for a while. I go, do, do, do, do bits Ana, unless you've been doing it since 1981, not even seventies. Like that nigger's crazy. It's on that one. I think it's thinking it's one of the old, it's like a set. It's probably just released recently on CD or something, you know? And uh, you know, he was like insisting on doing the pin. I'm like, wow, that's crazy. Like you're telling me that, you know that Richard Pryor did it already and they to keep doing it because you came up with it on your own.

Speaker 5:          01:51:18       Yeah, I look at that bill Cosby wine, you know, playing football. Either your dad that was, that was the one that you guys inspired and do that, you know? I know, but that because of you guys, that was the nail and that was the final nail in the coffin.

Speaker 1:          01:51:28       Yeah, I think so. I think that was the one where people went, what the fuck? Like, there's like, he's a sacred, you know, deity in comedy. Bill Cosby. Yeah. You know, there's not a single comic that'll, you know, ever tell you that bill Cosby ain't shit. You know, those, the fucking Noah's Ark bit, you know, and Noah, what, you know, you remember that bit, that whole thing. And he used to do like his stories these long, like, he was like, he had a real particular style of comedy man. Yeah. He invented the, he invented a style. Yeah. The long story. And when a punchline at the end of this story, you know,

Speaker 5:          01:52:02       I, I'm not a fan of his show. I wasn't a fan of the Cosby show, know what I really want to give was just condescending. It was just the whole shell was like, children are morons and I'm going to chop them down every week. I'm just kind of like, all right, man. Yeah. Well, you know, it's a fucking Sitcom, man. Yeah, no, I get it. But honestly, calm you like, I liked family tides. I'm not even fucking around. Like, I liked family ties. Uh, but that's about d like two and a half men. Uh, I'll say this for two and a half men. I've seen it on mute a few times on the plane and it looks like they're having a good time. Then maybe the best anyone has ever really done all these guys are with a good time and then on occasion I'll hear like a Dick joke and I'm always like, that's a pretty strong dick joke for the, for, for a sitcom at that time slot.

Speaker 1:          01:52:55       I only watched it once recently and I thought it was the most unbearable thing I'd ever seen on television and I thought it was incredible that it's so popular. We were talking about it yesterday. I, I'm, I'm, I was baffled by it. I couldn't believe how bad the jokes were. I was like, this is just, this is just an alien language. Right. I'm watching it with my mouth open and I'm hearing the laugh track and I'm like, this isn't even my language.

Speaker 5:          01:53:15       Yeah. If you don't watch a show with a laugh track for a while and then you do your life.

Speaker 1:          01:53:20       Yeah, I would like to watch it and have it all the laughs extracted like someone do it through pro tools, go in there, extract all the labs and just have him say that the jokes and have no response and see how they fucking bizarre.

Speaker 5:          01:53:33       She had, I wanted to do that where every po you take the lapse out and then every punch line I just go Bam. But I mean

Speaker 1:          01:53:43       see like, you know the curb, your enthusiasm has no laugh track. You know, and it's hilarious. But if you did that with like a show like two and a half men take out all the laughs. Yeah. And only have them act out the scene. It's fucking

Speaker 5:          01:53:56       posture. But having said that, cheers. Had a laugh, track sign photo, the laugh track friends had a,

Speaker 1:          01:54:01       hey, there's nothing wrong with a laugh track. What I'm saying is when something's really horrible. Yeah. And then you're just faking it. Yeah. And when, if you could just listen to it without the laughter, it would be so soon.

Speaker 5:          01:54:10       That's like that movie that looks that like, uh, the movie with them. I always forget the guy's name, the guy from who hosted the Oscars and he's handsome. He brought over playing the steel steel robot boxers. That looks good. I get that lifts off. It's like transforming a boxing match. It's like a boxing the deck. Rocky mixed the transformer. Everyone looks like this is called a real steal. Rosio. At first I thought it was a knock. 'Em sock. 'Em Mood. It is. And that's pretty much what it is. Yeah. I thought it looked good. Just cause I liked that. Transformers Hugh Jackman shirtless in the real steel trailer. I am. I want to see that bastard. I'm a nerd.

Speaker 1:          01:54:54       You fucking ruined the Wolverine Character, man. I don't care what anyone says. Wolverine supposed to be like five foot three and built.

Speaker 5:          01:55:01       I find those movies pitiful. I find the odd, the fact that they can only do superhero movies now, just pitiful. Like it's there. It's, I told someone it's like, it's there for dumb people to be able to explain to other dumb people. Like there's a dude and he got bit by a spider and he's half and half man, and he wears a uniform. So you're never confused about who's who and he's got a logo on the superman, has a logo on the front and the back in case you get them. You're telling me you don't like comic book movies, man. Uh, I liked, I'm such an old man. I liked to Chris Reeves, Superman. Whoa. And uh, which other ones have I liked? I didn't like men. I didn't like, uh, yeah, like Spiderman. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:55:45       I'm watching the trailer for this, this rock 'em sock. 'Em robots movie.

Speaker 5:          01:55:49       Oh, I like the Batman movies. I like the new Batman. I like the Tim Burton ones and I liked the, uh, the, the, what does names? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:55:57       This, by the way, this premise of this film where there's robots and the people like where this robot outfit and get in fights. It's a fucking great idea, man. That's actually real robots. Oh, these are robots in their controlling them remotely. That's what it is.

Speaker 5:          01:56:11       No, they're just, they're just training robots. Have our Avatar robot.

Speaker 1:          01:56:17       Yes. Pretty fucking. Have Avatar robot fights. To me it's no different than racing cars. You know what you're racing cars, you know, you're not supposed to be moving that fast. You're using a machine, move that fast, you know, and you're bumping into each other and cutting and cutting each other off.

Speaker 5:          01:56:30       In one of those that was in, uh, it was in, um, the end of x men or the end of, uh, of, of uh, ironman wasn't, that wasn't Jeff Daniels and like, uh, or it didn't, didn't I liked that movie too.

Speaker 1:          01:56:46       Yeah. All right man. It was fun, right? Yeah. He's a new cognac. It looks fun. A lot of people are shitting on it online. It looks pretty fucking bad ass to me. And they're like saying that they owe that guy can't be cone and he's not built enough. He's not this. No. Nobody really looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger and the fucking 1500 BC. Right. That shit's unrealistic. No carbs. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:57:07       All red meat back then he was on a strict diet in the, in the, in Paleolithic Times. Paleo Diet, Paleo.

Speaker 1:          01:57:14       That's what a lot of people are doing right now. Cause that's true. It's all the rage. I didn't know that. That's a good book. Paleo diet is all like vegetables. No grains, no rice. Oh yes, that's good. It's all things that are meat and vegetables. You know, things that people in the Paleolithic would've eaten right before agriculture, before hot dogs and shit.

Speaker 5:          01:57:33       Um, yeah, those, those uh, you think that that's, I guess I'm, I'm, I'm out of touch with what the people want. Yeah. I just a big fan of robots and, and good CGI. Yesterday's you're a big fan of frogs now. Doesn't it look like good CGI in a financial way of looking at this movie? I think it's the most genius thing ever. You're mixing like fighting like UFC mixing it like robots. Like it was generated by a computer robots and fighting like the was a guy who had guys down on his luck and then the, you know. Yeah I see that too. I mean, but I don't know. I think it's a good idea for kid, for a kid movie. I'm guessing that's what this is kind of like a teenager movie is good. You mean a movie? Cause that's their all for fire off of these goddamn teens, teens. Uh, no. I've said, I told somebody that if the Godfather was released today, Michael Corleone, a word, a spandex suit, she on it and drive a fucking buy like a Batmobile, but it'd be like no, be a cannoli movie. Moly. And he would sue the G on it.

Speaker 4:          01:58:45       Oh, how funny would that be if somebody pitched that in the meeting? I just think he's the best. I just, everybody loves him. He's number one. Right? Right. Anyways, an outfit that's different. He separates him. Yeah. He puts it on. He goes down, he fucks up and know that they know who it is.

Speaker 6:          01:59:01       Um, wait, everybody's got a costume. Just a costume that retarded people can understand.

Speaker 5:          01:59:09       That's superman. You just go, oh yeah, he's fucking, I'm retarded. That definitely superman.

Speaker 4:          01:59:15       What is your take on this fucking Spiderman thing that they're doing in Broadway? You know the, you know the whole story behind this, the Spiderman play, it's the biggest, most expensive play they've ever produced by far on Broadway. And apparently it's a fucking financial disaster

Speaker 5:          01:59:30       and people are dying. People are getting heard of their fucking backs and shit. I was, if there was another accident,

Speaker 6:          01:59:38       I was gonna do a Twitter, a tweet where I'm Spiderman himself came out and condemn the music.

Speaker 5:          01:59:45       I was like, look, we've got to stop as Spiderman. Please give me a bad name. That's funny. Yeah, no shit. Does this the thing where this is the guy's a hero. He wants to save people and it's flooding and it's just more people have been injured then. Yeah. Then they've killed more people in the Green Goblin. Am I right? Yeah. I'm all right ladies.

Speaker 4:          02:00:04       They're flying around during this broadcast, right? They're only there during this, uh, this performance

Speaker 5:          02:00:09       flounced around like they're on a Webinar, they've reopened it. They're trying to just read it, brought the original director back. It's just, it's like, hey, you just want to say it. I'm like, Hey, you guys know you don't have to do this. You're going to stop. Right. That is everybody. Like, just maybe just stop.

Speaker 4:          02:00:23       It's hard though. Once you commit to something, it's pretty much over. You know, it's very difficult to quit something once you're rolling. Admit that

Speaker 5:          02:00:32       you know there's a, the term is motivated reasoning where you just go, oh no, no, it's good. Yeah. The whole reason you're saying is because you want it to be good. You also tell what people's pitch.

Speaker 4:          02:00:44       Oh yeah. The worst is when you go to a table reads and you hear the producers with the fake laugh because yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:00:50       try not make sense. Is that there's any, yeah. Anything Grocer.

Speaker 6:          02:00:54       It's a, it's, it makes you want to, it makes you want to move to wherever I am, right?

Speaker 5:          02:00:58       No, whatever the fuck I am. The hills. If you want to, you think stalkers wouldn't even bother you, would it to stock you out here would take a lot of money. You spend a lot of money on gas. Getting down here,

Speaker 4:          02:01:13       nothing. I, I would be very happy if I didn't have my, a marital situation and children be very happy living in the woods. I would like it, but the, all the people that I see when I do the UFC, all the people that I see when I do comedy shows and all the other bullshit, I need the opposite. I need to, I need a balance. I need to counterbalance that

Speaker 6:          02:01:31       documentary. And in the shining a DVD, there was a documentary that Kubrick's wife made. No, it's excellent. Like scat man Crothers is just crying for no reason the best. Um, but uh, Jack Nicholson says in the documentary, a famous person meets uh, in uh, in a month the same amount of people that a non famous person meets in a lifetime. It's true. Yeah. Which is just about true.

Speaker 1:          02:01:59       Like just you have no capacity to remember them anymore. It's a, I get embarrassed sometimes but not remembering people, but it's a thing called Dunbar's number. You literally only have running in your burners hundred 52 plus, you know, plus or minus. But you know, you only have room for that many people in your brain and you know, want every fucking weekend. I meet more than that. Yeah. Every weekend at the UFC.

Speaker 6:          02:02:20       Well that was, I met Obama at the, at like a month ago, the on bin Ladin Eve cause my really, yeah cause my buddy Seth Meyers hosted the correspondence center and I wrote a bunch of shift form. And so I was there and I met Obama. And so that debt and, and we had a really fucking funny, cool exchange. Like, like I said, uh, I, my name's Neal Brennan, I created Chappelle show cause I coker British special cause I know Michelle was a fan and he's like, Oh man, we'd love that. In fact it's got to be the greatest show of all time or something. I was like, man, how cool would it be if you could get him to say I'm Rick James Bitch. Uh, and uh, so he's like, Michelle, this guy credit Chappelle show texture has to have Michelle comes over. And she's like, we were still upset when it went off the air. And I was like, how do you think I felt? And so, so, uh, so then we have a exchange and I was like, I'd said to Obama was like, this is also odd man. I go, do you ever get used to this? And he goes, nope. And he goes, but I can't just up and retire like Dave did.

Speaker 1:          02:03:18       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:03:18       Really funny. That day he had gone to Alabama to survey the, the tornado. He went to Cape Canaveral to, they were going to launch something. Gabby Giffords, the woman who got shot, the senator guard, the congresswoman who got shot was there, saw her, gave a commencement address at a Miami Dade Community College, flies back to DC, has to be personal and engaging with all these hundreds of people are lined up to get a picture with him and then he's got to do standup also. He's got a hit out on, been loud that he knows. And the people like, this guy's is too cool, easy to cool. Would you want them like, oh my God, fucking stressed out. Like he's not, he's the right amount of cool. And the fact that he knew to be like, he, he'll, he probably doesn't even remember meeting me. I'll never forget it. You know what I mean? Like, and he knows that. He knows that part of the job is just performing. Uh, the job of the president wears, you know, you've got to perform Joe Rogan. Um, no, but I'm sure there's a party that you, you just want to go, I don't give a fuck and walk away, but you have to like, no, it's part of your duties sometimes. I don't think you asked. I don't think that you're overwhelmed. You get overwhelmed, but you Kinda, you kinda can't, it's part of life.

Speaker 1:          02:04:35       I would say that it just, people being nice. You, it's what most of it is. It is. Yeah. No, it really isn't. If you were a hated person and that was going on, imagine if you're, you know, Monica Lewinsky or someone like that. You know, where everybody's like goofing on you or a Le Bron, you know, everybody hates him now, you know, any, any that's, that's gotta be fucking really hard to be a celebrity who's done something really fucked up. I love, you know. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:04:58       Yeah. It's gotta make you gotta fuck with you.

Speaker 1:          02:05:01       So what are you doing these days when, when you have to,

Speaker 6:          02:05:03       uh, doing stand up and, um, you know what, I'm going to start doing it as a, I've been shooting cause I like based on this paradigm, I'm kind of into the idea of just auto to do everything myself, put it out like, and so I've just been shooting some sketches. I haven't shot, I haven't edited them yet, but I've got a lot of sketch it. My brain is, my brain kind of wasn't working that well for like two, three years. It was just a little sluggish. It was like my hard drive was full and I started taking this shit called five HTP. Yes. And in sense that my brain has just been like our fit. How much milligrams of per day are you taking? Do you have any idea? A hundred. 400, which is way too many. Yeah. But I don't, I, I've always suspected I didn't have serotonin and this is serotonin. Um, so since then I've just been spending a lot on ideas for sketches, for stand up, you know, for jokes, for whatever. And it's gratifying that I'm going to try to do it kind of on my own. Cause I don't know, you know, people always say, why don't you write for this show or that show? I'll write for sath cause he's my friend and, and uh, and I don't, and I don't want to be on a show where I can't control what's being selected.

Speaker 1:          02:06:16       Right. So you don't want to do something on the Internet where you can control ever.

Speaker 6:          02:06:18       Yeah. Well I mean I can, I could probably have a show somewhere and control a lot of it, but I just, I just want to stop craving corporate approval. I want to get past this idea of like if you've been a benighted by Viacom or whatever, then you're more legit. Cause that's the great thing about Twitter and Facebook and all this stuff. He's like, it takes them out of it, you know? Uh, so I'm going to just try to shoot some sketches and, and do stand up and, and I would love to be a standard. I would love to like do what you do, you know, obviously being, doing the TV stuff greatly helped your, your draw.

Speaker 1:          02:06:56       Yeah. It all helps. But this has helped more than, than anything. This podcast has been the biggest impact on my stand up by far by a giant long shot. That's great. I never have been able to sell things out way in advance like this before.

Speaker 6:          02:07:08       And it's just from, from you feel like people have a better understanding of you?

Speaker 1:          02:07:12       Yeah. In two things have happened. One, I put out that comedy central special, my last one talking monkey's in space, which is a good, it was one of my best ones. It was a real representative of a real set too because a lot of times you're doing. And when did you release it? Year and a half, two years ago. Something like that. Year and a half. And um, when that came out it was on comedy central, even less like less than a year ago. Um, that made a big difference because people say, oh, but

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       the fucking knees actually got material. It's actually funny. You know what, this bill burr said, Netflix has been big for him. I have a one on Netflix as well. My first one I did was on Netflix. Netflix produced it in 2005 and then showtime bought it. So it was on showtime in 2006. But that wasn't as good as my talking monkey's in space one. That's my best one.

Speaker 6:          02:07:55       Yeah. So I mean, so that would be, I finally have, I could do an hour, so I May, so that's when you're going to do these music centers and you know, clubs. I'm going to go out and start doing an hour and, and then, and then hopefully I'll, uh, hopefully I can and I, you know, I, I would also like to direct my own hour. I think that would just be like a Dickie, that'd be cool. Be Cool. Like really cool. Yeah. Like, cause I don't think anyone, Louise probably done it. Um, but uh, but yeah, I just, I'm sort of like aspirational again. I just want to take the all of like the sort of corporate shit out of it. Cause I just think it's, it sets up a Shitty, yeah. Like I don't want to shoot something. And then someone got like, they, the audience will may not see this. And it's like, yeah, but I shot it and it felt like me and Doug did a pilot for showtime and it's not bad like David off. Yeah. Uh, and it's, it's all me and Doug do with thing. This just if there's any comedians listening to this is really helpful. Once a week we have to write thousand word essays and give them to each other. Like, so we have gays. Fuck, we have to. And so we have to, uh, so it just helps writing,

Speaker 4:          02:09:10       right. Of course. As yourself. Uh, but yeah, so just the idea that people aren't, you read a book, you guys should both go write a book and you know that the, the essays that you write to each other back and forth for a year, that's a fucking great idea. 40 each other, they're just like about, they're basically stand up. It's just trying to flush them out. But it's not like dove the fat the past week with you has been, I think we should start doing that. You and me, we'll write to each other. If you want to talk to each other, we can make a podcast scared. Just scared of, right. I'm

Speaker 6:          02:09:37       scared to be judged. Uh, yeah. So, so I, yeah, just doing shit from the ground up I guess. Cool. I mean, you know, I don't really have, I'm doing a bunch of dates, which are, I'll be posting. What am I, what the fuck? I'm in Chicago this weekend doing it. I'm doing a show with George Lopez at the Vic theater called Viva opening for him. Viva Larissa? No, it's like a heat. Everybody does like 20. It's like four people do 20 minutes in Emc. Really? Yeah. Called Viva Larissa. What is it? Ah, they've done like three of them. Are You Spanish? Well, um, no, but I am a hard worker.

Speaker 6:          02:10:17       Uh, are you willing to get a Tan? Uh, they, uh, no I don't. It's just George. I think he just sees it as like a way to, uh, have people that he thinks are funny to time and he MCS and, and then I'm open for Seth, uh, on Seth Meyers. I think that's at the, that's somewhere in Chicago. It's so weird that your friends, you look so similar. I know it is fucking hot. Like people think we're brothers from there. Um, if we were brothers I wouldn't speak to him. No, it's a family joke. You guys get it. So you've been through a lot of shit, but it seems like you're having a good time. Yeah, man. I mean, sorry to blow your mix up, but uh, but yeah, like the Chevelle thing was not easy on me. Like it was not, I don't even think I realized it.

Speaker 6:          02:11:01       Like how sort of rough it was, the disintegration cause it, you know, we were best friends for like 12 years before that. So would you ever come on Dr Phil and maybe with him and to work it out? Yeah, no, we've talked to Phil would probably, oh no. Uh, Dr fell, Drew's got a pro now. Me and Dee ever cool? No. So what happened with him on the plane when he freaked out on the unit? Any information about that? Uh, I was on a plane somewhere and they've actually shortened the flight and landed early because he was freaking out. He told me that they were, the pilot was fucking with them and just being a dick for TMC. I Dunno. For tms or like they at TMZ was like their, when they landed or something like I dunno, that's what he told me. I didn't like the pilot called TMZ from the cockpit.

Speaker 6:          02:11:49       No, I don't. I honestly have no idea. That's, he told me that the pilot was being a dick and like fucking with them and like doing this with the controllers or something. Why? That's, I dunno. That's what he told me. And then when he got here I was saying, I don't know if he's willing to wait anymore. I don't, he might not. Yeah. What exactly is that possible? You mean not really. Yeah. I can't even wrap my head around that. How's it possible that he wouldn't be smoking weed? I know some people don't smoke weed. Yeah. But when they smoke that much weed, lot of theory about black weed smokers in white weed smoker, which is, I've never met a black burnout, but yet like there's new, like he like black hippies, whereas white people can get fucking completely burnt out. I don't know what it is, but we actually did like, uh, uh, uh, study.

Speaker 6:          02:12:44       We did a thing on Chappelle show words. I think maybe the day you were there were snoop got high with a bunch of people. Uh, we, and we ran and snoop got high and then a bunch of like, our staff got high and we ran them through a battery of tests because I just have an idea that there is no such thing as a black burnout cause snoop is a sharp motherfucker. Dude, there's a lot of smoke more weed. He's gotta be in the top thousand Americans in terms of the amount of weeding smoke that I've seen him smoke and he's the smartest guy. I know, Bob. I think it's on misconceptions, man. Smart Guy with weed is not going to be a dumb guy. It's going to be a smart guy was high dumb guys on, we'd just get dumber. They just have more enhanced right now. They want to talk more about their stupid ideas and they appear even more stupid. But there's

Speaker 4:          02:13:31       plenty of black burnouts man. I know a lot of them have that theory sucks. I know a lot. Go to the hood. There's a lot of black dudes smoking. We'd sit on the porch. Do you want to do shit? That lazy as fuck is a lot of them. There's a lot of people that are smoking weed. They're lazy as fuck white or black, you know, they're just lazy fucking people that they get high and they get even lazier, you know? But you're a smart person. Marijuana I think enhances you.

Speaker 6:          02:13:52       Uh, yeah. I mean I, I found that it would not enhance me, but I just didn't like it and get the right shit. Nah. Was a diva. I like, I like, uh, I personally like who I am.

Speaker 4:          02:14:04       Do you know the difference between indicates the Tiva? I like how you said that. And with Joe on the end of it, he made it a personal decision. I made it a personal, I don't know the difference. Oh, there you go. The whole culture of it kind of bores me. The culture is gross. We talked about this yesterday with Brian posts saying in the interest of brevity again, the a, there's a huge difference between indicative sativa. Endeca is a really relaxed like couch. Hi Macy, right? That's Endeca Sativa makes you want to watch documentaries and stare at space and looked through telescopes. Right. It's a totally, completely different psychoactive experience.

Speaker 6:          02:14:37       Uh, I may have never interacted with that.

Uh, so, uh, people set up these whosay guys set up a, a, uh, they're actually through like ca, like the agency. Like they set up a page where so that ca clients can tweet shit and own it.
