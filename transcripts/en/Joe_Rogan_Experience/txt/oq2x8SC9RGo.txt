Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Dump, dump, dump, dump, dump. And where live unfortunately moral Rinaldo is, is deathly ill and he cannot make it here, but the great boss routing boom, Pasito Guapo is here, former UFC heavyweight champion. And your friend Kevin Random and unfortunately the guy who won the title from a passed away recently. That was sad, Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:00:24       Yeah. The conspiracy theory was already on. I saw on line because he didn't. Morrow didn't do ww II yesterday evening. So they said, oh, he was at the funeral of gather edelman. I said, no, that's not true. He was really sick at home. But yeah, that was the, that was the craziest news we found out after we just did our podcast and then we went online and um, what? He got sick, he got sick with pneumonia and then it's going to revive him.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       Well, he had staph infection worse than anybody I've ever seen in my life. Did you ever see some of

Speaker 2:          00:00:56       pictures? You know what I said to people, if you, if you use smokeless tobacco in that little box, you could literally put in that hole that he had in his chest. Remember that? Yeah. Yeah, it was insane.

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       Well, we'll show the picture. Jamie, see if he can find the picture of Kevin Randleman staph infection. I never knew that I could get this bad, but he had holes in his body where you could look in and you see all the tissue and attendance. I mean, just incredible. You see it third, Jamie, I'm talking like a fist sized hole. It was crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:01:28       He, this guy survived everything as well. Look at that.

Speaker 1:          00:01:31       Oh, it's just incredible. I just don't. And he fought after this too by the way. Up and he fought afterwards. But when your body is that compromised from something like that, I'm assuming that was mercer where the medication resistant staph infection, that stuff is real dangerous and people die from it all the time. Look at his leg to look how swollen his ankle and his foot is. Oh my God. Very scary. Oh God. And Kevin Randleman in his prime mean what a stud. What a specimen. That guy was to see him that compromised. I mean, I don't know if he just ignored it and it just kept getting worse and worse. I don't know. What happened,

Speaker 2:          00:02:15       I don't know either, you know, but I, I have the feeling that it's like with all the flights that were pretty much the same, you'll probably, it's the same as well, you know, you have something, you feel bad, you know, your launch. I'll. Everything is hurting. Whatever man, you know, I'll take care of that tomorrow once it gets worse, not realizing because we're pushing all the limits all the time that it at the moment you're feeling it's probably really bad already. You should check it out, but you know, just push it away. Let's get rid of my. Let's do my work first and then we'll take care of that later. It was too late. That's the feeling I have.

Speaker 1:          00:02:44       That is a problem with mental toughness and some fighters they just keep pushing through injuries and I've always suspected that that might be the case with Cain. Why cain keeps getting injured over and over again and now he's starting to get some serious injuries where he's had back now, both shoulder

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       surgery, knee surgery. I mean this is a guy in his prime. I mean, I think Kane is only 33 or something like that. Right? He should be regenerating like, like this now as a heavyweight. That's your prime. The early thirties for heavyweight. So generally when they really come into their own and to see him constantly injured, I've always suspected it's just his mental toughness is almost like a burden because he pushes through everything. You know, Chris Weidman, I think the same thing with his knees. He's had some serious knee problems. It's because they, you know, they have the problem. They just go, fuck it. Let's just keep going. And they can block out pain in a way that, you know, most people, they get a series, knee injury, that, boy, I got to go to. The doctor got to get this checked out. Not when you're in the middle of camp and you're defending your title, you fucking keep pushing through it.

Speaker 3:          00:03:47       Yeah. I'm telling you, all my students know because I used to be executive like all the other guys. I say if you have an injury and the doctor tells you, take two months off, take four months off. That's my advice. Now you take double the amount of. Everybody does the opposite. Two months, one month or three weeks. Yeah, don't do that because later in life, like with what happened with me, it will backfire for you and it's such a good piece of advice right there because so many guys, especially acl surgeries, how many times have we seen guys get theirs? Their knee reconstructed and then they try to get back on the mat too quick and pop bumps again. The new knee blows out again and you're looking at another six to nine months. It's so, so common. Accrues Elisha Benji redneck. He had like also like from a, from an illegal corp.

Speaker 3:          00:04:32       So he had something in his knee and illegal courtyard. They had the fbi. Yeah, an illegally obtained. It waS. He got a letter from the fbi. he almost lost his leg and then he had this. He, we went to dinner with him one time. he had a machine on him that filled that. His blood, everywhere he went, he got this crazy infection and then years later he gets a letter from the fbi and it was the guy who was illegally, uh, it has handled in the end, donors in the and whatever they need for knees and for, uh, for everything like oregon's. And they found that guy. Yeah. And it was from a cadaver that was infected. And that's why we had all that problem. Yeah, it was shit. It was really crazy. Did he get a discount or something like maybe later he was just right into it.

Speaker 3:          00:05:17       Rain check for the other knee happens. Benji radek is a guy, a lot of people forgot about it. Isn't fucking talented guy. You don't. I always talented at the time when was call me crazy when anderson silva was, had to speak of this career. I said if I have six monThs with benji and he would listen to me because sometimes she gets that ego that, oh, I can strike with him. No, no, you don't need to take him down and then strike him, you know, because she would knock people out with one punch. This guy hits so hard, he would hurt my hands on the Focus mitts. I'm as the craziest follow he has and I'm telling you what, his wrestling was so good. He would just take him down and just Beat hIm up. I guarantee You that, that that's how powerful he was. Wow. You know, there's a lot

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       of guys that don't realize their potential and benji radical was one of those guys that people would always talk about and the gym, you know, they say like, boy, if he could figure out how to put it all together.

Speaker 2:          00:06:07       We did a few times at the ifl when he was training for the anaconda. She was there. Yeah. And then he started listening and people go like, man, he, he, you transforming them into a kickboxer. He's just listening at this moment. But when you face another guy, like for instance, he fought a Scott Smith, you know, and I told him, I said, don't brawl with the guy. Yeah, but are people going to think, I don't want to blame it on me, tell them that I set so otherwise I'm not going to train you anymore. And of course the fight starts, smith comes out and he starts brawling with a guide. That's what the guy does. Don't do thIs. Like with vandelay silva, don't brawl with the guy. You know, you just got to pick them apart from the outside and she would take him down. He got in trouble at the end of the first round. Then he took him down, hit him once. That was the end of the round, but almost half scotsmen aren't exactly the same thing where I've lost my voice. I just stopped yelling. I said, why don't you take them down? It's really that easy for you. Do it. But he didn't.

Speaker 1:          00:07:07       He goes, a funny thing when guys want to beat guys at their own game or they want to show that they're not aFraid to stand with people. It's hard to. It's hard to. You know that that fucking thing that makes you great in the first place, that makes you a fighter in the first place. A lot of times can BIte you in the ass.

Speaker 2:          00:07:23       Just don't. Don't do wHat the other person is best at. If there's one thing he's weaker than yours, go to that, whatever it is, but it was ground literally striking.

Speaker 1:          00:07:34       Well, that was one thing that gsp was always so good at. He was always so good at imposing his strength, like whatever the guy was. If a guy was good at wrestling, he would try to keep the fight standing. If a guy was good at standing, he would take them down. You know what I mean? gsp was so good at that and being unpredictable too as to what his approach was going to be. He thought he was going to strike and then he's going to take you down. You think he's going to take you down and he's going to kick you.

Speaker 2:          00:07:55       He was like the la jolla, the la jolla. Every time when he fought, he had a new techniques. He used new combinations and the same thing happened with gsp. Every time you saw him, josh koscheck, I remember the fight. It was a jap and was just spinning back, kick to the body and he nailed it over and over again. You knew that for the six weeks, eight weeks, whatever he was trading, they worked on that. You know, for the rest of you ad lib a little bit. What you normally do, like to know. Just pepper.

Speaker 1:          00:08:21       Yeah. the josh koscheck fight. man. That was a. That was an ugly one. THat one is. I swole up like that. Josh was in a seriously bad shape after that. He couldn't fly after that fight. Yeah, that was. That was one where they hear that they had a drive from. I think they had that fight in toronto. Is it toronto and montreal? I think it was toronto, right? No, no, that was, I believe it was montreal because I think toronto was jake shields. That was the big one at the roger center, right? I have no clue. I think so. Either way. He was in Canada and he had a drive down to boston and I believe he had to stay there for a couple of weeks before he could even fly back home to san jose. Wow. So you think that will blow up in the air as well?

Speaker 1:          00:09:00       Again, it was so bad. It was an orbital fracture. There is, there's a picture of it right there and that's after the fight, but it was so bad that they had to operate on it and those blowout fractures of the eyes apparently are extremely painful and very dangerous too because it's the bone behind the eye that gets broken so they have to go in behind the eye and repair that bone and sometimes when they do that, your eye ball is never the same again. It looks different like do you remember bob sapp after cro? Cop Hit him in pride, I believe you called that faculty member cro. Cop cracked him with the left hand. Was it or was it [inaudible]?

Speaker 2:          00:09:39       No, it's a. They'll go, oh, wait a minute. It game watching. I think it was know it was because I was actually training. Bob said, well, whenever you call it training, I trained them one and a half times the rest. He was doing interviews. Oh really? I go, dude, this guy right now in Croatia, he's kicking it back. He wants to kill you because you're on the top the now you just beat the host. Yeah. Is crazy that he beat him. So, uh, yeah. Then he came to train with me because I told him before the fight, but he said, if you would fight me, why would you go for. I go, I go full body shots because your stamina and I kick your knees instead of your legs. I kick your knees because you have to carry that weight all the time. Who dropped him two or three times with the liver shot? So after that he came. He said, I really want to train with you. I said, okay, well then I'm going to be in Japan anyway, so let's, let's work out. But yeah, he was still busy doing media. I said, don't do that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:34       He was such a superstar in Japan. He had to capitalize the amount of money he was able to make. I think people in America realized how big for those few years. Bob sapp got it.

Speaker 2:          00:10:44       Pan. You have no clue. We went out to dinner with him and that they have to close the restaurant and have to let them out at the back because you see one person in the front, two, four, and there was a whole group, couldn't get out anymore. You couldn't go through the lobby of the hotel and it's not like he can blend in a 375 pound man. Huge. He was. He was. This was in the tokyo post. They had a picture of him on the cover coming out of a like a massage place and he saw this little girl thanked him and here's the amount and the man stands there and all these little girls that had that little black thing in front of their eyes, you know that they do so you don't know who that person is still there and he was upset. He said, why didn't they put one in front of my eyes? I go, yeah, blocked

Speaker 1:          00:11:36       your whole ad. People are going to go a while. When he was fighting in pride, I mean he was like a character from a movie. he was like the boss in a video game. You remember? Oh yeah, god, it was hilarious.

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       He did all these dances, the bulb, seb dance, and they go to every shape and every show and you had to just love him. He's a. He's a Freak and you know what, the first time when he fought against nogueira I go, dude, we got to hear from this. This guy, he, he, he was doing really well against a seasoned guy like nogueira eventually. Okay. Last. But he just started. I think if you would have kept focusing on the same training that he did at the time, it would've been a much, much tougher guy because he had a lot of talented physically at least. Well, he was just so fucking big to. Maurice was training him at that time. yeah. Maury smith was working with a med and married

Speaker 1:          00:12:33       there. We're working with his kickboxing and they're really trying to put some technique to all that muscle, but you know, you're talking about a guy who legitimately was 375 pounds with abs.

Speaker 2:          00:12:44       I mean, he was like a science project in the history of performance enhancing drugs. Right. Yeah. I mean, is there a bit of project is he's like, this is as far as you can push it before you fucking explode, before your skin just explodes. Like a water balloon. Oh man. Yeah, we see it the past. You see that with these guys who use a latino, they always are around to fight as they start to become purple, you know, and then suddenly here they died of a heart attack and so I wonder what happened there?

Speaker 1:          00:13:16       Well, he made it through. He survived and then he started just quick tapping. He started doing all these fights where he would get hit, why he would go in hard and if it didn't work out he would just tap and he fought a bunch of guys like that where he would start off the fight really well and then wind up tapping out just and they would fight again like three weeks. Do the same thing. It just kept doing it. Living off of the name that he had created while he was in pride.

Speaker 2:          00:13:40       That's a very sad thing for me that that's almost the same as going on the street then beg for money. It really is to me, you know, I think that is a man. He's such a good guy if you meet him. Oh so very, very nice guy. But yeah, that I, I, I don't like that. It's the same occur, you know what I saw that special thing that they did on him, but he sells cars now. You know, it's, it's hard to look at that because especially he knew where he was in the past and that old is gone now you know, it's, it's, you can be really high, but you can fall really low. Yeah. And yeah, he had fired a saying that they said it's so great to fight this as but when you're high, you're high, you know when you're. When. But when the lows are, their is really low as well. The difference is too much. Well actually, uh, look what just came out with ellen and rhonda. I mean she broke down just thinking about it now and it's a moment that are there. So everybody would have that for a few seconds, but yeah, it get you down because like that,

Speaker 1:          00:14:43       I know that after the fight that night she was just devastated. But of course, I mean that was a brutal, brutal knockout and it was a fight where nothing worked. I mean just nOthing worked. She went after holly and she tried to bully her and holly just great footwork countered her and that kickboxing and her movement. Holly's movement is the best in all of women's mma or footwork and movement. She's so good At getting out of the way at countering when you're coming in and the style, the bulldog style of rhonda has. Especially the way she fought that fight that night, just played right into holly zahn.

Speaker 2:          00:15:22       that's it. She knew exactly what she was going to be able to time because she just wants before forward

Speaker 1:          00:15:26       and that head kick, whew. you know, that was one of the things that I said after that fight, I'm like, this is. She should take a long time off after that fight because that's the kind of head kick that's the kind of kao that it takes a long time to recover from. You might look fine, you know, you might be able to talk, but mentally and also the brain itself, that kind of an impact like a high kick like that can really take a long time for everything. He'll for Anything to normalize.

Speaker 2:          00:15:54       Well, kenny rice that she says no because I took my words back because if we're talking about a floyd mayweather versus rhonda said, well, if it goes to the ground, you know? Yeah, I, I truly believe, but kenny said footwork on, make sure it's not going to go to the grant. I go, no, no, no. Five rounds, five minutes, 25 minutes. I'll a long time. He knows there will be a clinch one time, but that's exactly what happened. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:16:16       yeah. There's a difference. First of all, in fighting in an octagon, which is a huge surface. Like if you look at a boxing ring, most people you can look them up much, much smaller space. And also I just don't think rhonda would try to box a floyd mayweather. I think she thought that she could stand with holly holm. Yep. And I think a lot of is based on holly's previous performances in the ufc, especially the raquel pennington fight. Yokel pennington who was very tough, very durable. And I've read rico, I always give her. I gave her the nickname of the ear exploder because she's had so many moments in the fight where you like, screamed so loud that you blow people's eardrums out. Like, um, when she fought Ashley, evan smith and bulldog choked her. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Blood everywhere. And she talked to her like one second ago. We were screaming at the end of that fight. Like she's out. She's out. And then she but pennington so tough and fought conservatively against holly holm and almost one like that was a split decision. So you look at that fight and he go, well boy man, maybe rhonda could stand with her and just go after the way. She went after bench go, hey, uh, the race she went after a Alexis Davis, but man holly was just on point.

Speaker 2:          00:17:26       It was game planning also, you know, after that fight with raquel, that was perfect for her because that means, okay, stay away from the big bumps, you know, and they know that rhonda, she's an athlete, she can hit, she hit you. When I saw that, um, what is the open workout in Brazil? And I'm one of these guys, I have always thinks to say, oh, does not good. You should do that. You can prove this. You know, I'm always, I'm very critical and I always think to myself, am I too much? Is that what am I doing? But at the moment I saw her training there and this is, this is not fighting and I know this doesn't translate to fighting by hitting the focus mitts and hitting the bag or all that stuff. It looked nearly perfect to me. The rotation of her upper body, the movement afterwards to move very taste. and like also, I really thought, man, yeah, okay. I have nothing to say now. This looks really good.

Speaker 1:          00:18:15       I felt the same way. Yeah. I felt like our hand techniques were on point and then when she polished off beds cohere and the first round it's sort of spoke to that like, okay, well look, obviously she. She hits hard. Her technique is improving and she's an elite athlete. Yup. You're talking about an olympian. You're talking about a person that has that mindset to push forward and figures out a way to get better at everything she does, but so does holly. Yep. So does holly and holly has got way better kickboxing skills and way better. She's got way more diversity in her striking game where it was. Ron is just punching knees to the body when she gets close to the clench. Nice the body, but on the outside it's just punching. Where's holly? Holly can head kick you and knock you the fuck out. And she sets those kicks up with kicks to the body. She'll throw kicks to leg. That jackson camp. They all liked that oblique kicked in the thigh. This is a dangerous kick.

Speaker 2:          00:19:04       Yeah, it's going to be a lord. And when somebody is going to snap their knee, it's going to be over.

Speaker 1:          00:19:08       Do you think so because knee bars are now allowed heel hooks on outlawed.

Speaker 2:          00:19:13       I know, but that's a different thing. You know, you do this is once your leg is a little stretched and you get hit there. Oh yeah, that's it. A knee bar or you have to be in a polyamorous, you know. But anybody else, we just put the knee bar on and give you time to tap. Won't have that. We'd no bleed cake.

Speaker 1:          00:19:28       Yeah, I agree with you. I mean, but it's so effective right now when it's legal. I understand why they're using it. [inaudible] jon jones is so good at it and it doesn't. You know, winkle john is one of the best striking coaches in the world. He really is so good and so underappreciated because he's such a humble guy. He doesn't. He's not talking a lot. It's not bragging. He's a very down to earth, normal, humble guy. But the results that that guy has been able to. I mean, holly is probably one of his best students, but of course

Speaker 2:          00:19:56       jon, jon, jon, I'm not a freak. He can change the world. He could be if he, if he's now on the straight and narrow and he's just fighting. I see this guy, nobody's going to beat this guy. It's going to be,

Speaker 1:          00:20:11       is going to be hard, that's for sure. But you know, the worry about john is that john's going to fuck himself up because like recently he just got caught driving with no license and no insurance and no registration and you know, he lost his license. He get, he's got millions of dollars. Get a fucking driver, man.

Speaker 2:          00:20:27       Yeah. But look at tiger woods. What happened to him? Because when all the crap happened with him, he mentally, he didn't come back from that. And I understand this is golf, you know, but same as fighting. It's some, it's a mind game. It's really a mind game. So kenny overstepped that. I think he can because jones is young and he knows how good he is. But if, if I were him, I say fight for five more years is stop you going down in history like a thousand years from now, they will still talk about you if you do it correctly or you know, he sidetracks and something bad's gonna happen to them. Let's not help.

Speaker 1:          00:20:58       Yeah, I hope he pulls it together. He's a great guy. I really liked john as a person. I mean he has his flaws like most people and he's young and the amount of pressure that he's on to be the youngest ever ufc champion to have this spectacular career. So early in life. The only loss he had was a disqualification. That was a bullshit disqualification. This, this stupid rule of 12 to six elbows. They got to get rid of that. If we don't know what I'm talking about, folks in the ufc, there's a rule and it's a crazy rule that you can't strike someone with an elbow from 12, 12:00 PM to six on a clock dial, like going straight down. AnD the only reason why you can't do it is because when they were setting up the athletic commissions, the athletic commissions had seen those karate demonstrations on tv where a guy would break a brick with his elbow and I said, well, you can't do that. That's got to be illegal because someone could die and this is what big John Mccarthy told me that he had to talk to these people. And he's like, oh, okay. All right. Then that was illegal. So that's the only reason why that's still illegal. But the great thing is if you're on your back, you're allowed to do it because that is the dumbest thing ever. It's so stupid. It's one of the dumbest rules that's still in place.

Speaker 2:          00:22:09       Yeah. Oh, well that's. We had a guy in holland, he police, he pulled it and wheat orlando with these two guys. When they fought each other, they will sell out all the time. I saw three fights of them live because these guys were crazy at full tie rules and alondo wheat and he put both of them. They would end the clench, like jump all the way up. And then come down with our. Most of the collarbones do that. They will go full blast.

Speaker 1:          00:22:34       Orlando, we who fought in the ufc, I think ufc two. Was it two? We fought against the rem co. Pardot. Pardot? Yeah. He got him in a scarf and elbows with illegal elbows. Now it is illegal and so true. Right? Well it might've been legal because it was kind of coming from 12 on the side. Maybe it was like 12 to seven or something like 11, five or one to seven. It's up to you what you want to go. It's so dumb. It's so dumb. I, I, you know, I have a problem with a few rules of the ufc, but that's the number one. That's the number one. Have also a problem with the putting the hand on the ground and stop news. The head. I always go if you have somebody lifted him up. Yeah. I feel like to down deponent, maybe that's a problem when they're up against the cage because you can't get your head out of the way. Like in pride. One of the crazy things about pride, which I think to this day and one of the reasons why I was so excited to have moral here too, you guys called the glory days. I mean some of the wildest fights in the history of the sport. Yep. Where you have stomps soccer, kicks everything but no elbows, no elbows to the ground. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:23:44       No, I, I remember fights that

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       they literally have ventilators silver in the corner over or ninja or shogun, you know, and it would hold the ropes. Just stomp somebody skullen pretty much. it's scary. I think that that shouldn't, that shouldn't be legal. It's like what happened in the past with the hydro huerta one fc now one championship. When you look at their fight, you go, that was the referee really messed up on that one. He liteRally dropped on all fours because he was exhausted and then he get penalty kicked in the face that, that could've been really bad. Well, I think it was really bad. I mean I don't know how much he recovered from that. That was a devastating knockout and it was also roger fighting at one 70. Which is not really his weight class. It really should be a 1:55 and he fought a big. Who's the brazilian guy that he fought? Don't remember his name, but that guy's a big guy and he. He had roger hurt and then that soccer, they have like a rule at one fc. I don't know if they still have it where they, they'll say like open, like what? You're allowed to do, stomp or a kick to the downed opponent. Well, this was a closed set. There was the guy's name, zorro Babo a, a man above it. It was a devastating, devastating soccer here. He said, I did not want to throw the kick. Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:25:06       Well then don't. Why would you do it? Do it. Which will be very dangerous at that moment as well because you're breathing, you're going to crack some rich, so it can be very dangerous as well, but you can recover from the crack ribs a lot better than you can step away. There's no need for that. I never had that. You know, it means being aware indicates and know what you're doing. You know, if I see a guys our guys out, it's not going to hit them an extra. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:25:33       it's, there's a lot of debate about the old rules of pride versus the rules of the ufc and that was one of the things that happen when cro cop started fighting in the ufc and then fought in a cage for the first time against gonzaga. Well, you know, he fought eddie sanchez first won that fight, but that was not on his level. And then he fought gonzaga gonzaga, took him down, held them up against the cage, elbow the shit out of them, and then stood them up and high kicked him. But he was saying like the elbows confused him. Like he wasn't used to that and he also wasn't used to the cage being trapped. Whereas the pride ring, you could move around like the ropes were there. You can get under the ropes. He could, you know, you'd never know

Speaker 2:          00:26:12       you can, but you can look somebody up also in a corner, which you cannot do in a cage. When I stepped for the first time into a cage, I was like, oh dude, this is, this is awesome. They can never look me up. This is the biggest thing I've ever seen. Yeah. So, uh, yeah. I think gonzaga, that fight an elvis come back to this. I thought that was so smart what he was doing. He was constantly throwing the right hand and it didn't even come close to his face like this. And I'm constantly thinking, why is he doing that? And then it

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       re, you know, I got, oh he's shutting his gig down because woke up. He might think if I just drove right stRaight like every 20 seconds in front of your face, he's going to think if I throw my left at the moment he throws that ride straight, he's going to knock me out. So he shut his whole game down and then he was moving to the left and that was, that was the blueprint to coco because after that everybody started doing it. Yeah. And it's interesting how cro, cro, cop got his revenge in the rematch in a big way with elbows on the ground. Seems kind of ironic that one of the things that cro cop was saying before that fight is that he didn't particularly like grappling and he didn't particularly like elbows on the ground. Meanwhile, that's what won him the fight. The second fight he won by being on top and but the elbows that are real talented striker can throw from the guard.

Speaker 4:          00:27:31       The difference in those elbows is just unbelievably devastated. And we saw that in the cro. Cop fight. Yep. No, he did a really good job that I had at one time. Also, somebody's arm barred me and I, I got out when I fought him the second time. I didn't want to knock him out. I want to bar him first and I remembered that armbar him the rope escape there. I had him and then he wrote escapes and I told him, I said, so this is pancreas. This is bankers. I said, no, you got it back. And then later on I heal. Hooked him actually will had crazy rules. You and you were the first guy to figure those rules out and I loved watching you fight back then because it was openhand striking with the hands but kicks. So like you were with the first guy that ever saw a fight in that.

Speaker 4:          00:28:15       First of all, that kicks so fucking hard. You could see when you would slam these guys with these kicks, they'd be like, oh, this is a completely different experience, but also you weren't slapping. You would see how the fuck. Do you pull your hand back so far? Yeah, I got very limber. Hands the bone. Yeah. You were pulling your hand way back and throwing straight punches and hooks and upper cuts. like when you fly food narky throwing upper cut. Like a punch. The same motion. Nobody does this still. Look, if I'm in the garden and I, I just lift my hand like this. See? Yeah. Just slide over his chest and face. Why is nobody doing this? Why is nobody just leave it here? Just hit them a little bit. Look away. Because most of them, when you look away, they think and the book just flat hand on the center of the chest and just shove it over the chest.

Speaker 4:          00:29:07       Yeah, that makes sense. That does make sense. But wouldn't that work with a punch as well with. Yeah, but you have more space wIth a poem on this distance. This is much shorter than this. This is like an extra 15 percent, which will make a lot of difference. That's that distance. That's a very good point. That's another five or six inches at least. Listen, that's why I never understood nobody strong palm strikes. Now that left hook, right? Straight combination, right in boxing, right. It's a dumb combination. If you really think about it. If it's a short left hook, I'm way too close to my straight punch. It has no power. I can't stretch my, but if I do a palm strike and then a straight punch, now I got space for my straight punch. It's much harder. So why is nobody doing that? Now? I do closed lines and I posted a thing on facebook like a year ago when I hit a bag with a clothesline.

Speaker 4:          00:29:57       Dude, I don't think people can imitate me. My weight with a kick like that, they can kick and then I said, okay, now I show clothesline. Is she the back folding or out? My whole arm is the courageous thing. You can blog with ting had tried to block whatever you want. If I close line, you have to stand still. It goes straight through everything. I guarantee you and knock you out. Why is that? Why is it clothes on so power? It is so powerful because you can really lock it up. Don't stretch your arm because if you miss time and you hit your, you're going to hyperextend, but you can drag your whole body weight in there because you will like it and your legs are planted on the ground. Oh yeah. You're getting all that hip torquing. It is such a powerful strike and also with the clench when even when they stand like this, if I do this, it loops around to defense and it's the mecca to had still the legal part because it's outside the mohawk.

Speaker 4:          00:30:44       Well, he's in the back of the head. Standing never seems to get, like in boxing they get penalized for punching the back of the head. People say no rabbit punches, but when you think About a head kick, a lot of headaches, especially ones that go over the shoulder there, there the back of the head and it's, and it's legal and that's why they're effective. And that's why it was so effective with me with, uh, with uh, with pancreaS. I hid behind the ear. If you look at mike dyson's fights, you know, I don't know how he did it, but he did it. He was always the shorter guy. But if you see him hooking somebody, he hits almost the back of their head. He's got very short hooks now the body, it's ready for impact from the front, from the side, because you're used to it.

Speaker 4:          00:31:21       well, if you could see the punch coming, the behind, I always tell people just do with a poem, just do this to the back of your head and see what happens. So like just me doing this, it's all ready to go. You're not ready for that. So you can already imagine if you go hit as hard as you can be here. It's a sweet. It's a sweet bunch. I can understand that, but it's doing it. Whereas the head that much more dangerous. Oh, do this, do this. But I mean, is it that much more data than just behind it? Here? Just do that. Oh you, you remember? Um, when the hens old fart and world combat against that judo guy. I'm a, I forget the dutch guy. Yeah, he got his back and spikers spike as best baker by trade with them. Also got his back and just bet if they, if you can elbow the back of the head rear naked, choke her out the window, but it's just going to bang bang to the back of the head. And it's almost more effective than a rear naked choke because kaiser just gonna they're just gonna try to cover up. Yeah. And eventually, yeah, slIp through that. It's interesting to me that there's some really effective martial arts techniques that are outlawed and that's one of them. You can't hit that spot. It's, it's, it's kind of strange because In a self defense situation or an actual martial arts, if

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       you think about what is the most effective technique to use, knees the ground are very effective to head on a down opponent. Elbows to the back of the head are very effective. But are they that much more dangerous much? Should they be outlawed? Oh, here's the video. Yeah, henzel. Got it. Oh, look at this. Boom, boom. I mean no need to choke, but he choked him anyway, I think. Yeah, I know he's going to step on his head. Right? Smashed him. He smashed that dude. Well that guy. Here's the deal. Henzel, who's a very nice guy. By the way. This fucking guy was calling hensville all throughout the night and fucking with them. Look at. He's. Yeah, he's out cold. Henzel was in his hotel room and this guy kept calling them and fucking with him. He just didn't want him to have any sleep, so it just kept ringing his phone and I was like, oh, okay.

Speaker 3:          00:33:27       Wait, motherfucker. Yeah. It's so funny when you see a guy like heads and he's always smiling, you know, don't do it. What's wrong with people? He's really nice. He smiles all the time, but he does the same thing when he gets you in the balls, you know, watch out. Did you ever see that twitter, a sequence that hensville put online will beat the shit out of these muggers in New York city. These guys in New York city tried to mug henzel gracie not knowing who he was, so hands on, not only beat the fuck out of him, he followed them and kept beating the fuck out of them and make all these pushes. Thank you mayor bloomberg for making so safe, newer. Don't have to worry about guns. This to me is a pleasure. You already starts with. There are still guys following us. They probably wanted to rob me or something and then he makes.

Speaker 3:          00:34:18       It was like, oh yeah, this is really happening. I'm so excited. What a huge fuck up on their part. Well, he had one. We were, kenny arise now were somewhere. This is not that long ago. And he was also, he was walking on the street and two guys, same thing. He came to tell the story and uh, and he, he dropped the Biggest guy, right? He said, I just picked the biggest next month and why he kept walking. The police came, they stopped us trouble and he looks at the guys and the guys go, no, no, it doesn't. No, it's fucking. He says, you just picked the wrong guy. He told them they fuck you. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Well, he looks so friendly and nice. You know, I mean, when, when he's got his game face on, he looks like a killer, but most of the time, hence off smiling.

Speaker 3:          00:35:04       He's like one of those smileys happiest guys you're ever going to run into. And they look at them. They're big smile. Oh, that's. Is that an ifl ifl ring? But it's, this is the paperweight, this is another really big one, is a paperweight that they gave to us and the hens or couldn't be a nicer guy, couldn't be a nicer guy. And it's so nice to see how well he's done with his school too. He has one of the biggest jujitsu schools in the world. Yep. In, in manhattan where it's so hard to be successful because it's so expensive. Real estate. I think the ifl had a big part in that because they did a thing on 20 slash 20 for him and, or 15 minutes, one of the two. And, and after that it just exploded because once you get into the world of enzo, you know about what kind of person he is, you know, everyone likes him, you know, even even the guys like him.

Speaker 3:          00:35:50       so to people at home, they saw that guy and then they saw the technique and uh, you know, talent. Yeah, put hand in hand together and boom, anthony bourdain trains. They're also, his wife, trains. Everybody turns out, well, he's done an amazing job of putting together a fantastic gym in New York city with gary tonin, eddIe common, so he's got these guys that are in john danaher is a big part of that as well. He's got these guys that are trained there that are so successful in these jujitsu competition, so it's not just the legacy of being one of the gracies and being one of the most famous jujitsu practitioners ever, but it's also on top of that, it's the product, like the results that they've gotten in competition. Yeah, he's very smart. You know, he's got a really good staff as well teaching there, which is a very important thing because most of the time guys who are really good, they want to control it too much, you know, and then it goes down.

Speaker 3:          00:36:38       Like he did a great job just gettiNg the right guys for the job. What's also, you see extreme loyalty from the people that train there because they love hanzo so much. Like there's like a real bond with henzel gracie. Of course you don't. Matt serra who came from that lineage and then you know, a lot of his guys as well just can't say enough good things about him. It's funny. It's hilarious. then the one that's the first time looking for a fight. You're a model and then it gets old comfortable sitting in a certain way. It's so funny if you haven't seen it, there's a show called looking for a fight and it's dana white, matt, sarah and nick the tooth. And what they do is they go to small mma shows all over the world and uh, they see fights and find talent and that's where they find that kid go sage northcutt as well.

Speaker 3:          00:37:31       And then the guy who was, who they were setting up to fight bunk. Yeah. Cm punk, which is a. I don't know what's going to happen with that guy. I don't understand this whole thing. She got a lot of injuries. Well, I also think it's ridiculous for him to fight in the ufc. I think he should fight in a small organization. Take a fight in a small organization, build yourself up. I have always said that that's what should have happened with brock lesnar. I mean, if you look at brock lesnar as an athlete, I always said if you took brock lesnar and got him to a guy like matt hume, or for us a hobby and said, okay, make this guy a chance. You're dealing with a freak athlete. Unreal. Just train them correctly. Building them up, building them up slow, get them through the right.

Speaker 3:          00:38:10       But he wanted to fight right away in the ufc one fighting k one right to the ufc fought and that k one la show. Yup. Um, and then right to the ufc. Yeah, it's a shame, you know, and, but, but it's his name and then, you know, david, they, of course, they understand that once he fights were a baby has got to be a lot of people. He's going to have a gun into bayview, but that, that is short. It's always short. Like the money later in your career, your greg, all these things. I'm happy I never did

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       that. Yeah, I feel like make big mistakes. Well, I feel like he, um, he definitely had massive potential. I mean, he beat, I mean he beat randy couture. Yeah, I mean that's just unbelievable. I mean he beat the shit out of frank mir. I mean he beat shamed carlin and a fight. We're really out to show his resilience, got the fuck beat out of him in the first round. Came back, submit them in the second round. So we had some legit wins against legit guys, but just wasn't ready for guys like cain or especially allister. That was it. It was a bad foot. Well, if he could have taken it to the ground, it would have been different against goto or. That was the first time that I thought, oh, hopefully now more people start doing it. That was that crazy punch. And wiTh him it was because she was not super technically yet striking, but he hit an overhead and it hit with this part of the hand with the fist, the back of the head down.

Speaker 4:          00:39:26       Then with junior dos santos knocked out cain velasquez like that. I go, okay, we got it. People finding out they start getting it to it and then the laskers did the same thing to junior coming back, so I figured, oh, they looked at it, so now we're going to see this more often. But that was pretty much it. You see it here and there one time, but it's not a real overhead or data throw real over and not with the site. Then hits the back of the head again. What we just talked about. You almost like a ridge hands try. It's almost like a richard. Yep. Well you remember when chocolate delicioso throw that you got to chocolate liddell's sweatshirt on those new routes of fight ones, right? Yeah. Had a boss one t shirt at home. Oh you guys got one chocolate deli said throw it like over the top of his head.

Speaker 4:          00:40:08       Like he would. He would throw this crazy one and that's how he hit allister when they find him pride, he threw it like, like not a. Not circular at all, but like, like a 12 slash six punch, you know? It's a complete different punch. that's what I tell people. I said, how do I say, I've always really liked the technique from chuck is he's also wide open. A bitch gives them almost power equal left or right, so just like the and just I like to fight like that as well and he can hit really, really hot and he's not afraid about opening up. Sometimes though with him, you know, if he gets too excited instead of stepping back, he goes in for the kill and that got him in trouble later in his career because if you would simply step back and come back. But that's why every person, every guy, every, everybody likes chocolate l you don't look at chocolate day, say, oh, he lost a couple of times by knockout.

Speaker 4:          00:40:59       Nobody will say that. He did not lose one fan because he's always there to fight. That's why I really liked chuck. Yeah. He had one of the most exciting attitudes ever in fighting. He was always do or die and early in his career he had an incredible chin. Chin was just iron. You ever see the palae fight when he fought and valley tudo in Brazil? No. No, I heard about it though. It was crazy, crazy fighting that that was a fight where they had a net under the bottom rope. They fought in a ring, but it was modified for valley tuto where the bottom rope from the bottom, the to the floor

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       of the ring was a net going get out. They're trapped, bare knuckle and chuck's got hIm trapped in there and just beating the fuck out of them, like smushed up there. And this was back when, you know, chuck was known for his striking, but he was a very good wrestler. Yep. Before that. Yeah, that's why I stopped everything though, you know, that was one of the things that, what the fuck was his name? the guy who, uh, was the matchmaker for the ufc already. John perretti. John perretti told chuck right before he fought his first fight in the ufc. He said, if you take this guy down, you'll never fight for us again. Oh wow. That's like somebody said it to chuck right before he fought and they didn't want them to try to wrestle. Fuck his way. So chuck was like, oh jesus, all right, that's the debut of chuck liddell. You know,

Speaker 5:          00:42:18       who knew, hey, I got great hair

Speaker 1:          00:42:20       power. Well you hit, hit, hit hackleman. His trainer is also a legend, you know, and uh, a great guy and a real wild man too. They were a perfect combination, you know, hackleman and chuck. No, chuck's early days. You, you know, you watched some of those fights like the bob lou fight. I mean, he was just a fucking destroyer as the cake, right? That was the, that was the second time they fought, right? Wasn't it? I don't worry about

Speaker 5:          00:42:44       if we have morrow here, he'll uh, he'll, he'll tell the dates. EverytHing. Well with mom

Speaker 1:          00:42:48       tomorrow gets better. We'll definitely have a backer. I would, I would love to talk to them. I love morrow. He's such a great guy.

Speaker 5:          00:42:53       He really is. We have some crazy stores in Japan also because we, everything was just fun. We would come home or we will come home. We will eat breakfast in Japan. You know, you wake up early because if the jetlag were there at 5:30 window, breakfast place opens. We sit down and our table, we start with two, it will be at the end, 25 guys out there. Everybody jumps up there because it's comedy central all morning on all the fighters. You know, everybody's laughing, everybody's having a good time. Well, you guys did a lot of that

Speaker 1:          00:43:23       comedy sketches to. There was a lot of fun with pride in those early years days.

Speaker 5:          00:43:27       In the early day she had. This was just a. That was with the quarters, the quarters, they allowed us to do this and it all happened because I forgot my suit. I didn't know that. As a commentator you needed to wear a suit so they thought I was messing with them. I go, no, I really didn't bring us. Nobody told me to bring a certain. So I was in my shorts, flip flops and had this hawaiian shirt on and that was the first one that I'm hitting back and there's a bunch of these acacias. They're fannIng me down a feeding me grapes and I'm doing. I'm talking to steven who is in the event, you know, we're going back and forth and they say, hey man, we really liked that. Maybe we should keep doing this. and then we started coming up with this crazy opening.

Speaker 1:          00:44:08       Well, a lot of what you were doing, it was, I don't even know if I was working for the ufc back then, but guys from jujitsu we would all get together. We'd either go over my friend john's house where we go over my house and we get together with a bunch of guys and we would watch pride and ah, those were the days. So were the days because that, it was the early days of mma and you know, we had had in the nineties you'd have the, which was kind of struggling at the time because they were kicked off a cable and the only way you could get it was on direct tv. This is presumed Was before zoo football. But that's like right up around the time where pride started. Take off with a first hixon fight in a lot of people don't know. Hixon started off pride. Yup. Hickson was in pride month.

Speaker 5:          00:44:50       Yeah. Takota. Yeah. That was the first fight. A second. Robert put them on a map by beating the gracious. Yeah. Yeah. That's when it became big. That's why I always say, you know, for reason for that is rising that they need. They need a sacral rob. I like. I didn't need a japanese guy. They, they could do a few shows like this with a fade or an ankle and vandelay silva coming back and they can do a few shows, but eventually people want to root for their own. You know, they needed the japanese guy like South Africa. You remember in k one? He was getting very. I think he won the first one, but that was before all the foreigners gaming ones, the seek it teach you and all the. That was an animal bronco knocked out. Who's, oh man, fuck, I could fuck it. We saw the yelp a, the whole in holland. That's. That was the fame. Most famous place. Every fight was there always. That was one night. We had four guys from Thailand who were there and they were fighting old guys from magiro gym like rob cayman, mila. Well globally. I mean all, all the great guys hold a great strikers flamenco at a world title fights and it was broadcast live to Thailand.

Speaker 1:          00:45:58       Wow. They all got knocked out. That never happened again. After that. They destroyed him. It was awesome. What was it? That was the holland days of, you know, the, the top holland guys when right around the time where ramon dekkers started dominating and rob came and started dominating so much talent came out of holland in holland is a small country. If you look at the size of holland, do you look at the amount of high level kick boxers that have come out of there? It's pretty incredible.

Speaker 5:          00:46:30       You know, you did the k one for instance. They at the end, from the final eight, they fight all year. They make a final tournament for the people who don't understand it. They fight 10 times a year or 10 shows year and then in decemBer does the final aid, like the ufc started, eight fighters the best from the whole year compete against each other. Whoever wins gets like 40 to $50,000, whatever the price money is. But they start realizing that the final aids were six were dutch, seven words show now, if you will, for instance, in a guy who was born in Morocco but lives in holland or even when you were born in a moroccan parents, you know, suddenly you come up with the moroccan flag because they say we can have the perfect example. Roman vegas. The first guy I saw, first time I saw him fight, I wasn't the same cart I was fighting as well. So this is, this is long time ago. This was just see class, you know, in holland you have new c class b class a class. And um, and I just started. So I probably was new and fought c class I

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       believe. And a friend of mine calls me, says, you're going to watch. I said, no, I got to fight. I got a warm up. He says, do you want to watch this? Get was just get. And I see him and he's with the little mullet and he is skinny and he fights this guy who was much older than he was like 16, 17 years old, an older guy with tattoos. So automatically you go, I'm going to get killed. And my buddy goes, just wait til he starts, you know. And the first gig I don't, I still remember he kicked a guy, a low kick and the guy horizontal right horizontal and fell on the ground. I'm looking at my buddy. I go as the craziest power I've ever seen. It was so explosive and he was so skinny at the time, but his technique was perfect.

Speaker 4:          00:48:09       His technique was perfect and he was so ferocious. Yeah, I mean he didn't care. Like when towards the end his ankles were so fucked up that he wanted to fight southpaw because he started. He didn't want to throw the right kick, but he would. He would kick a few times and we'd go fuck it and go right back to it. And with his bad leg, I mean they were telling him like, we're, we're close to amputating your leg. You've broken your foot so many times. You broken your shin, your, your whole leg is just a series of. And he would wrap it up tight and just still wants to fight started. He didn't give a fuck and just throw it right into elbows. He'd kick everything. Our motto, suck it. He would just place it back in the corner and the core hammers his trainer.

Speaker 4:          00:48:48       He told me, I never heard him complain. Like he would say, oh, you know, I hurt my ankle or I hurt my hand. He said, I had never heard him say anything. when he comes back, he goes, what are you doing? I'm putting my shoulder, but I can put this under the socket. It was almost like it wasn't his body. Yeah. Like he was using a borrowed body. Crazy guy, man. Super good. You know, that's kevin, kevin randleman freak of nature. I mean, he could have done any, any sport, you know, guys like that. And that's where ramon dekkers too and happy they found finding though. Yeah, well ramon dekkers really set the standard. He really set the standard for ferocity and he sort of embodied that holland style, the dutch style of more tie where they just. I mean he was just a crusher crusher.

Speaker 4:          00:49:34       Yeah. He was like a rob came and all these guys, they start what they did, what they lit. The reason was they started winning fights in Thailand was because they had better hands tied to hence and the kicks together and they didn't do that in Thailand yet. Predominantly only kicking, kicking in a lot of clenching. And then you had like a rob rob came on or what is the greatest kick boxers ever, you know, and then you suddenly, that's the technical version. The more smooth one probably he had the slow twitch fibers, you know, because he, don't get me wrong, he knock you out with every punch. but then you had ramon dekkers was the explosive guy that he had that technique and he, he added the explosiveness to. It's pricelessness too. She's just crazy power. You know, when he fights bomb the first time, you know, and he hits him with 26 punchy, you gotta to see the shots that he was

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       never a 200 fights. Never been knocked out in his life. He was the first guy to do that. And they just see after the five wendy's down, the whole place is quiet. Nobody moves. And then rob cameron jumps in the ring with the dutch flag pulled out. Fight up man. rob k not robbed him. And ramon dekkers versus kolbe and kolbe on luck. Some toy tongue, right. Is that how you say it? Just, it just, I, oh, it's been a with these bullies names. She knows. It's not going to say okay at golden his first bam thai names are pretty crazy. The amount of adverbs and adjectives they have in their fucking like whatever. Strange. Yeah, the, the uh, the amount of consonance all just lumped in together and all these crazy names period is. But, but just to see What kind of barriers that hook, the kick bond.

Speaker 3:          00:51:24       Oh yeah. Leave that left hook, man. What rob came in. The difference between rob came in. Here we go. Yeah, here it is. Rob came and was just more technical. He didn't take as many chances. You didn't get hit as much. He was very smart and very technical when he fought and he's a great trainer to know. Rob cayman was really one of the guys who was responsible for brandon vera early in his career. You know when brandon vera was knocking everybody dead in the ufc early in his career, he was training with rob came in and when he stopped training with rob came in is when things started lIke not going so well For them. Oh, this is caLled bond. This is a slow motion dishes. They show cobana no knocking people out I think so they know who co bonus and they called them the buffalo hat.

Speaker 3:          00:52:04       That was his nickname because he never went down while he had a giant head. And then this is, see if they can show. So go slow motion. Maybe that says slowmo honestly, that there we go. Now they're actually fighting. This is going to be so crazy the way he gives him the extra punch lights, an event, you'll see it. So ramon, like most of the time, fought south paws that what it was. No, he didn't get the docs don't fault both. So most of the time when he fights different is because he hAs an injury, like you said. Oh, this is lawrence skin, a kenshin, uh, who's an amazing, uh, like analyst. He does a fantastic job of breaking down fights. HiS fight breakdowns are amazing, but he does a lot of it in slow motion to show technique. So see if he could find just the actual fight instead of that video because when you should definitely, if you're a fan of striking and you want to understand it a little bit of a little bit better watch lawrence and stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:53:02       What is the, uh, his Youtube channel. Lawrence's youtube channel because she kept him some props. Just his nAme. Lawrence pension. He's amazing. Lawrence is amazing. He does such a great job of breaking down fights. His videos are incredible. And um, he really deserves a lot of credit for that. I love watching his breakdowns, especially tie. He loves it. A lot of moitai moitai breakdown. So here's the actual fight itself, man. these are the, these are like in a lot of ways, like unprecedented times because that ties back in those days we, we were used to karate and we were used to a pka kickboxing. Yeah, 10 gigs. Wok to the. At first I didn't know. And then when westerners started going over to Thailand and competing as the ties, we've started seeing what high level more time they had and they're kicking technique. And especially the low kicks was just devastating.

Speaker 3:          00:53:57       That was the first, the, the, the american championship when they came, when they lost it was low kicks, gamble. We're making sure weren't ready for rufus. Went and fought. And it's kind of funny because duke roufus talks about, he kind of laughs about it now that they were saying when, when his brother got fucked up, I forget who his brother fought, but he got lit up with leg kicks and stopped. And duke was like, well, there's not a lot of techniques of that. And you know, I don't think there's much doesn't take much talent, but they didn't know. You said it's god. This is it. Ramon dekkers in his prime. I know the coupon gets up the finishing point she's going to give, which went to god the fucking hands. How tough was coal bon looking at me? He's out on his feet. He's walking forward.

Speaker 3:          00:54:45       They've given him a standing eight count the last right hand. What's the into? This is going to be so bad as. It's amazing. How much bond could take the book. Oh, that's it. Watch. Look at the audience. Just only dutch guys. Everybody's quiet and then you see a cayman coming in, but it's going to get the flag man. How fucking tough was cold bond too, to take those shots. A lot of people lost a lot of money there. I mean there's not a whole lot of people on the planet. His weight, they would have taken those punches as many as he took clean to the face and there we saw the flag and, and ramon dekkers was just teeing off full power. I mean, winging those shots in on them too, man. You know, there's such a scary guy. Yeah, man. Yeah. Glory days while he's up there now with gavin.

Speaker 3:          00:55:43       So they're having a blast. Yeah. He, he died young as well. Yeah. A heart attack while he was riding his bike. His bike. Yep. What was that? Do they know what happened? No, the first started, maybe it fell, but it was, it was just hard. And he's also, because we all been crazy every week. We all liked going push, pushing limits, you know, we were drinking with everything in it, but he was stoli like a year. Nothing was started cycling and I knew, you know, once he starts showing and he loved cycling, I'm was going to go 50 miles an hour. I know he's going to because that's how, who he is. He can't stop being the best at everything he does. So I thought it wasn't just riding his bike, be going crazy with wisco. Yeah, that's his attitude was pushing animal such an animal. He probably pushed himself to his heart broke.

Speaker 3:          00:56:29       And also when you see him, you know, all the elder punishment, he got into tae with all the cuts on his forehead looks really bad. So when you're looking at it, you go, oh yeah, that's. Yeah, I want that. Well, I remember when he fought duane ludwig towards the end of his career. I mean deep into. I mean his face was flattened out is massive scar tissue all over his eyes. His nose was flattened out. I mean he took a lot of fun. I don't think anybody's face changed more than vandalized though, that his face got flattened. I mean, you look at vandelay during the old valley, tudo days and then vandelay towards the end and pride. I mean it changed his face, didn't they do surgery? But the post, like nick diaz did, you know, to make a flutter in the ufc. They did not only did that, they took cartilage out of his rib and reconstructed his nose and vandal.

Speaker 3:          00:57:18       He had his nose made big so that he could get more. Aaron. He looked crazy because his nose looks very different than it used to look like. I remember the first time I saw him was on the way. He was like for the weigh ins. He wasn't fighting. He was with someone else and he came up the stage and I didn't know who the fuck it was scary and someone said, that's vandelay. And I went, what? What? Because he had just gotten the surgery so his face was pulled tight. His eyebrows were pulled tight and his nose was big. It was like he had his nose made much larger with a big piece of cartilage so that they can take punches. Oh yeah. That's the same at the stupid air. So you know those golden flowers. I sucked them out three times a day. You've got to step through it and you didn't need a big syringe and a large needle because I do not want to have those areas and they go, oh no.

Speaker 3:          00:58:11       The considerate trophies. I go, okay, good for you. For me, I always worry your guards. I have a little tiny pieces of it here and they always wore at your garden. It's just, it's just not smart. It's it. It affects your hearing, like it looks cool, but it affects the way, the reason that is designed that way. So the sound echoes off the outside of the year and you could hear better. Like if you take your ear like folks who don't have cauliflower ear, take your ear, go over the top of your ear and bend it down. That's what those guys are hearing like all the time. Like randy, randy can't even use iphone earpods. Those. You're, you're, you're, they can put them in things. So yeah, walk around with a bluetooth and I said, how can you listen to.

Speaker 3:          00:58:53       It's not even an air will. Randy told me to his, you know what happens with what it is is calcification. So when your, your brakes and bleeds, if you don't drain it, it actually turns the calcium. Turns out. So it's like a bone. So what randy would do is get on top of guys and grind his ear into their eyeball. He would get his ear like when he's taking guys down, he was shoved his ear. Right? It's like he had a rock. Something very wrong with this guy looking at. Yeah. Well, and just to let people know at home it really tiny surgery can fix this right away. I mean, they can fix this in, in, in 10 minutes. Now. One of eddie bravo's black belts. Brent, He had it done. He had his, uh, his ear caught and then they pulled back and they pull the stuff out.

Speaker 3:          00:59:37       But it can, it can get very dangerous too. You can get some infections in there. Like you remember dave? Tarell? Yeah. Dave had his ear fucking removed because he had such. He had his ear removed. They had to cauterize the inside of his ear because infections were so bad that it was like it was fucking with his equilibrium. His balance was off. Like the whole inside of his ear was just pus and infections. Kimbo against thompson. James thompson fight when he, they called it like a satellite was hits it that you see. He went in there with. I mean, he didn't, not only did he not drain it, it was like a recent blood. It was like, it was like he had a mouse living in his ear. It was big. Oh, that was nasty. And then he hits it. That was nastia splitter. Well, probably no one's worse than jessica.

Speaker 3:          01:00:21       I versus a laura. Laura smith. Was it Laura Smith? What was her name? the gunshot. Leslie leslie smith. Thank you. And jessica. I hits her an ear and you see the blood up in the air from her ear was insane. It will be crazy if she hits. She used the blood flying and I go try to catch it to this great to see it right there. And half of her ear was hanging off her head. And by the way, how tough is leslie smith? Because leslie smith was mad that they stopped the fight. She had a fucking hole that you could see her brain. Oh, I. I'm always been a big fan of less, but listen nickname. Right. The gunslinger or something. That's a. It's a. What is her nickname? Something like a western. I dunno. Yeah, I dunno. It fits her Because she's tough. And jessica to start targeting that one spot over and over again. Oh, it's disgusting. That was a. That was a nasty ear, man. That was a bad. I never got that. People use. I will be too nice at that moment. I won't. I won't hit that day or I guess people go like, oh, that's a clint eastwood. I thought a bike. Cynthia is towards the peacemaker.

Speaker 3:          01:01:36       Well, woman's mma is really heating up right now. Right? With joanna. You and judge. Check a lover. Who's the. Who's the guy? Yeah, she's fun, man. That chick is wild. She breaks her hands a lot too. Unfortunately. She broke her hands in to ufc fight so far in the first. The first ones, but I just the last five. yeah, that's why she couldn't finish. He said. Yeah, total edible. Yeah. She's tough as shit level show. The way she gets in, in, in the, in their head, you know, the way his story gets low and looks at it from below. She's dangerous. She's dangerous, but claudia good data is a fucking beast to. Yup. That's a great fight. And they're going to coach alongside each other. They're gonna coach on the ultimate fighter and then they're gonna fight and they're gonna fight the day, the big july ufc 200 card.

Speaker 3:          01:02:22       Oh, well yeah. So they're going to have the finalS on friday where the ultimate fighter finals and then they're going to fight for the title. You want to young jay, check and logic a day, and then they're going to have the big 200 card, which they don't even know exactly who'S going to fight in the 200 card. And I mean that's july. So a lot depends on conor mcgregor versus dos anjos no, no, this just for joanna. I want to see the ultimate fighter. Now you know, because that. That's going to be interesting because they're a personality I think. Oh yeah. It's going to make it. Well, a good data. Also an animal. Well, they fought and it was a split decision very close right away. The codella luke's, right? Her body. Yes. Like in a, also like a machine. Very good moitai too, but really good ground game.

Speaker 3:          01:03:07       Yep. So the question is, what is she gonna be able to get it to the ground because joanna hurt her in the first round, knocked her down and won that round. But a lot of people thought that claudIa, I might've won the second and third. So it was a very close fight, very close fight, very controversial and very tightly disputed fight. So I think the rematch can be very exciting. I'm looking forward to that. Who said chika work with for wrestling? That's a good question. That's a good question. I don't know who her wrestling coaches, but I think she does a lot of her work in Poland, you know, because she lives in Poland. So, I mean there's so many good european wrestling coaches, you know, europe and wrestling, there's a lot of great, uh, like especially, uh, they, they, they bring a lot of eastern bloc wrestlers, a lot of the russian wrestlers.

Speaker 3:          01:03:52       Like that's what how george st pierre got so good, the russian nationals who are training up in montreal and he goes, oh, so technical to, you know, those guys, the russian style of wrestling is so technical, so drill oriented, you know, there's so many really high level. I mean look at what's happening now in the ufc with all these sambo guYs. These high level grapplers like, um, um, well first of all you've got a habib, norma madoff who, who's one of the best in the lightweight division, but he's another one that has a hard time staying healthy, you know, but, but you, you think it's a training or you think it's just the person who knows, you know, it could be both. You know what I mean? He's such a fucking animal. You see the way he fights, you got to think he trains that way.

Speaker 3:          01:04:38       The way he fights it. Just so grinding. He so fucking attacking and relentless like a badger, you know? So who knows? Yeah, I, I always, I, I wish I was guilty of that as well. I trained really hood like, but what I hear stories I hear fight or saying, oh, we go like on fridays we spar like 70 percent and I go in and they said no, that's it. I say that's just, that's it for sparring. Yeah. Oh wow. And they always ask, oh, so how many times she did it after your workout? Because that's what we're gonna do you know if we're going to try to. I'll try to hurt your legs while I. If you have to fight, I won't be in your body. I will go with kickstarter.

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       I expect that most show to go hard with me and the hats, you know? Yeah, of course. We watch out for the head. We don't knock each other out too much. Too much, too much because it happens as well, right? It's inevitable, but that's why. But I didn't fight for seven years. When I did that, 2000, six, five, I felt great to share no ring rust. I said no, because we're doing it two times a day. We're training, we're training, you know, and if you're used to it is the same as a fight. Even if they go hard, that's a fight. Yeah. Well it's very similar if you train like that. Some people feel like that's one of the ideas behind hard training is that when you train hard, you fight hard and it becomes normal. But then other people think, well you really should just train technical, like a lot of the ties.

Speaker 4:          01:06:00       Do they train more technical and more light wIth their sparring. The hard work is all pad work in bag work. So there's people that think like that's the way to save yourself. Wonderboy says that. He says he spars very light now because he wants to preserve his chin, wants to preserve hIs head. He's like, he saves the, the hard work for the bag and for fights. I used to, to in a lot with my buddy amir, amir, perhaps the navy seal guy from Israel. And um, he, um, he's the one guy who could hang with me and I mean stemming noise because I will not go my way, but we will go hot. People who see us, they think without a control, but it's not at all. So it's also about who you train with. If one day your, your steady sparring partner is sick and somebody else pops up or you don't know that guy and that guy tries to make a name for himself, you know, that's when you get the injuries.

Speaker 4:          01:06:50       But I truly believe in going hArd. How many times do you see? It really angers me if I see guys in a clinch needing other people and they need them. Like they need training, they just lift their legs. Nobody gives a real neat look at joanna when she makes sydney different story or alister explode in there. Yeah, to have a sticker on a nice to the thighs and it's not going to do anything if you do it like that. right? If you do one hard one, it's worse than a low kick because they don't expect it. The muscles relax. He goes straight through, but nobody doeS it. So yeah, there's a few. And we were talking about it one percent of the fighters, but isn't it though, like all techniques, like some guys just aren't that good at certain techniques, they just don't have the kind of pop like you'll see guys throw kicks and this is nothing to them.

Speaker 4:          01:07:36       And it's not that they're not trying as they don't have the looseness of the hips, they don't have that sort of snap into the keg, no emotional time. It's just technique. If he, if you train your legs and you put like 10 pound ankle weights and you just start throwing knees from zero, don't, don't make it. Then a bouncing lake, um, sit ups, I can do a thousand sit ups as long as I use momentum to get back up. That's the problem with a lot of guys do. They do the knees. It's all momentum standstill, xplode standstill, explode. And a trick also with nis is to move your hips away from your partner statements with a straight punch. The longer than he is on its way, the more power it's going to have. And these guys, they don't, they, they actually, they teach. Throw your hips in with the needs of the body is the dumbest thing to do.

Speaker 4:          01:08:22       It's like me giving you a straight punch and closing the distance. I'm jamming myself. You don't want to do that. Free it up. let the hip flexor do the work. And at the moment you connect. Yeah, that's when you want to push your weight in. But a lot of guys don't do it like that. They just need like they do in training. Inspiring. Do you get frustrated when. I mean obviously there's some very high level training going on an mma, some very high level training, but there's also some training where you see these guys like they're just not really prepared correctly. Well if kicking inTo bowls and the inside low kick a night, 90 percent of when it happens, it's just because the guy doesn't know how to get because he's kicking me, kicking up his right foot. If he gets with a leftist, rightfully his toes, I guarantee you, pointing straight to the opponent.

Speaker 4:          01:09:02       What they need to do is open that foot letter, toes point to the side, and then the angle is much easier to kick. You will never have that problem. These are just guys who Don't know how to kick and that's why to kick into pills. Well, it's interesting because there's that kick to the balls of so much more common in mma than it is in more tie in glory because they know exactly that going kick. You know, we were taLking about gloria getting before the podcast started. We're talking about glory. Getting picked up by fight past glory right now is so good. there's so much high level kickbox and talent in the world and now that you know, glory picked up. It'S showtime and k ones not really around anymore. I mean glories the game is the game. That's it. He got the best guys on the planet now.

Speaker 4:          01:09:45       You know goco saki, even. Yeah. He got injured. No, but I don't know. I don't know. I just found out, you know, mara told me because he was gonna maybe do that show. I think maybe now it's ron crook falling in for him, but I'm saki. That's, that's the guy was like tyson. And this what I teach a lot, double rides, double left punches, you know, everybody has a pattern. Um, the fight that really upset me is packeo. Ken's mayweather. Re veterans hanging against the ropes. I was just unloading, but everYthing is left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right now. If you think of Mike Tyson suddenly throws in the left upper god liver shut or spleen. Write up like a double right? Double left. You mix that into a pattern because if you throw a boxer in the corner and you start unloading on him with right, left, right, left, right, left punch veteran, they just punch.

Speaker 4:          01:10:33       Yeah, but if you go left, right, left, left, left bubble, and you changed the second punch as well, like a three shot with a left hook, and then you go to the body. Well, keep looking in his eyes or a left uppercut. Change the angle of the punch, but use the same arm. That's when you get really effective and you see it as in boxing and thai boxing. Everybody who does it is really effective at it. Yet he didn't do it. They got paid $80,000,000 in $180,000,000. You would expect to do that. Yeah. I had a shoulder injury that doesn't prevent them from touring. A double left. Our double right. Mike dyson, spleen might up bucket. I think you know, six out guys. I would like to bang, bang over unusual patterns. Yep. That's it. Yeah. Did you ever see the uh, well john wayne has got fucking amazing highlight

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       reel, but one of them on my instagram page the other day where he hits this guy with seven upper cuts in a row with the right side is bad.

Speaker 2:          01:11:22       Bang, bang, bang. Like you can't prepare. You don't know the guy's going to do that. I do this yesterday. My class double right up at gun left. People don't know double lift. I had to hector pena. He had three left upper cuts and the second, the third one, the guy fell already down. He hit him on the way down is three leftover.

Speaker 3:          01:11:39       Here's the deal, john wayne par highlight. I love this highlight. He said he's an animal. If one is good, two is better. John wayne par is a wild mother. Really a great guy. total edible. He also came up with that striking organization where he lives with mom. Vague loss pretty much, right? It's his tie. I'd never got anybody who doesn't do that or why they don't do that here. well they should and maybe he can bring it to the United States, but you know, what he wanted to do is have like a cage. Like he likes the cage, he likes the fact that you're trapped in there and he likes the small gloves. So it was like, let's just do listen. Fuck. The ground game was just strike like this. I love a guy like that. He's a wild guy. He's fun. Have you ever seen the pictures of his face?

Speaker 3:          01:12:24       Like how many times he's been stitched up? Oh no. I can only imagine. There's a picture of John William [inaudible] face after one of his fights were. His entire face is like a roadmap of stitches. It's fucking crazy. Like see if you could find that picture because it's one of those pictures. You just, you just look at it. You start shaking your head and blinking. Like what the fuck? His whole face is patched together. Look at, look at this photograph. Look at this. Oh, jesus christ. Real. Yes. That is the craziest thing. It's one fight. One fight. His entire face. A thai guy. Yeah. He got the shit elbowed out of them. Wow. It's such an insane photo. He's other face. He's over 300 stitches in his face. 300.

Speaker 2:          01:13:08       Wow. Yeah. Well eddie. Well the ears are still good.

Speaker 3:          01:13:12       At least it doesn't have the color left. one's been hit there as well from shots. Yeah. Not really from grappling. He fought one mma fight, but you know, he's just never really trained. Grappling. IT's not really his thing. You know, put fucking has moitai goes. I trained with him. I got a chance to work out with him and learn some techniques from everything he throws is with power. The way he throws a leg, he pulls the right hand back as he throws that jab, he doesn't just jab like a boxer would throw, jab, the way he jabs. He's like pulling back the right and stepping for got everything he throws is designed to kill you.

Speaker 2:          01:13:49       That's been, that's been my my thing also. I like it like that. Everything you throw make them. When you said in the beginning I kicked somebody and you see their faces and I don't care if they block it. I jusT kick as hard as I can on the defense just to get inside their heads that they know that you better blog this kick because next time if you're not blogging it, you're gonna have it's gonna be a problem, you know, and then start breaking your

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       opponent down. Mentally hit him, hold the hands up high. Just hit as hard as you can under. Hence a lot of guys don't do that. They truly believed that this is enough defense for like a, a right hook. It's not. It's like me putting on a helmet. I say this in seminars at seminars to, okay, imagine I would tape a focus mit to my face and you can give me a straight punch or a hook. You think I go down and everybody goes, yeah, of course you're going to go down. I said, so why is everybody doing this? You make yourself one with your head. I'm just going to hit your hands as hard as I can. You will still go down, you know, but what happens in the mind of a fighter, as soon as I hit you and I see your hand going up, automatically I let my power off because it's like, oh, it's it's defendant.

Speaker 4:          01:14:57       What if you just don't care or closed line? And like I said in the beginning, it'll go straight through. Yeah, well you started throwing kicks in the pancrase days. I remember, you know, because I came from a kicking background, there was not that many good kickers in mma before maury smith for conan. We really didn't see that many head kick kaos in mma and especially against a black belt when maurice fought conan soviet era. I mean there's a first time that was in um, public. No, no, it was in that other one. It wasn't that john pretty organization, wasn't it like extreme fighting? Yeah. Extreme files. Yeah. And that was the first time I was like, oh, okay, now we're finally seeing a guy who could throw some kicks in mma, but with the first time really was you in pancreas because you, they make, you wear those crazy boots you had like wrestling shoes on with a big boot shin, shin thing.

Speaker 4:          01:15:47       Yeah. But you still at slam that kick into their arms and just see like nobody wants to hold pads for a guy like that. no, forget about like getting it on your raw arm, but you know, it's, it's a great way to go in, into a fight because you know, you can, you're capable of doIng that. Yeah. So you only have to connect, you know, and if you know that joanie, you have to connect, just wait and connect. And I also, I'm not that guy who likes to get hit, you know, I don't mind, but I'm, I wrote a nut so I just use movement, you know, and then uh, and then just explode at moments that you need to explode. How many finders you training right now? Do you train any active guys? No, you, I, I train a few guys at my gym, but I've been traveling a lot now so, uh, the coaches that I have at my gym or training them, but we got a one, three, three pros and then a bunch of amateur guys.

Speaker 4:          01:16:34       So you're stIll doing inside mma with ken kenny and um, you do world series of fighting still wheelchairs a fight. Actually this weekend coming up on a saturday this saturday on nbc isn't really nice. More osis funding again. He's very talented. His footwork to. That's the guy that people sleep on. Yup. Yeah. They don't really realize how talented that guy's in. It's unfortunate that world series of fighting is not getting as much attention as it deserves. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of mma. I know it's very hard to pull eyeballs to it. It's a, but it's the with gloria. Gloria doesn't have the eyeballs, which blows me away because if there's something exciting, you know, gore, it's a gloria event in that just engaging kid to. Oh, what an animal. A fucking sad. She's a fun, fun, fun to watch. I, you know, he should tone a little down, loa say, but, you know, maybe it's just fight style and he just wants to go because sometimes he gets hit hard and I think eventually we had, there were clay guida or you know, like fighters.

Speaker 4:          01:17:35       Eventually it's going to be who's going to give. Yeah. You can only get hit hard and just walk through things so much until eventually your body doesn't cooperate anymore. And then most of the time, once that happens, it's going to happen a lot. So there's a lot of crazy shit going on right now in mma. I'm the big one. To me, the one that I'm most excited about is March 5th. Conor mcgregor versus those. That is a fucking crazy fight. First of all, who the hell has ever been like connor? Yep, well I mean the best shit talker of all time. Hilarious. I, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm in love with that guy.

Speaker 4:          01:18:11       I love him. I love everything about him. We had him on his show. He's funny as you know, everything he does. Every speech he does, it's different. It's not like he's repeating everything I do, like I do an interview before and it's about, let's say your movie, you know, you, you say the same thing over and over again, but he doesn't know, you know, and he doesn't really use profanity as well, so it keeps it clean, but very encouraging. Yeah, you can use it on television was so great. You know. And then how old chapo shirt. Oh, how crazy is he who does that? But to see, but he's making gets in everybody's head. That's why he beat the. Although you could tell, you could simply tell. Everybody can say, oh no, I'm, I'm used to that. I will put a street over or rafael dos anjos says that also.

Speaker 4:          01:18:53       I said, eventually it's gonna come through, you know, you gotta start doing something back. He was a few fun things that you always can do is not engaging him. I liked the way dos sandra says handling. He's just letting him talk and he's like, when we find this one I'm out, or I know he's just like solid and stoic. I think he's also learning the lesson of how although sorta got rattled and he's not going to get route. I think told sandra is a different guy is a. He's even doing the chapel posed, shaking hands and sean penn and that fixture, so fucking crazy. I love him. God, that guy's fucking awesome. It's hilarious and he can flock in fire fights. Get great. Reflects this. I mean it's timing is really good. He's using his reach really well and the way for us to, as a hobby.

Speaker 4:          01:19:40       He described his lefthand for us to hobby, by the way, did an amazing breakdown. If you're listening to this, go to youtube for rasa hobby, who I in my mind is one of the true great masters of video. He does an amazing breakdown of this fight, but the way he describes ca connor, he's like, he's got the touch of death that left hand and it's true. He just lights guys up at that left hand. Plus it's a laser guided, you know, it's, it's on target. It's not just. He just doesn't hit the head. Hit your jaw. Yeah. He's so

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       great timing, so accurate and so and so beautiful with his footwork. The way slid out of the way of all those advanced and just drop that left hand in. Just, you know, rda is this guy, you know, in the beginning I go always under the radar. Right. And some of these, boom, he's there and he's just beating everybody. I mean, I had ever expected that it was a monster. He really is. Well, a lot of what's going on to his. His conditioning is off the charts. Was working with nick curse on who's one of the disciples of marinovich and they've got him doing these crazy explosive plyometric drills and all these footwork drills and have you ever seen his training routine? You're realIzing they got a fucking oxygen mask on him and he's throwing body shots on the bag. It's all this incredible, brutal breakdown for for strength and conditioning so that he could really go five rounds like that.

Speaker 3:          01:21:00       There's no such thing as having enough seminar. That's what I always tell everybody. No such thing. Yeah. You got to go all the way. That's why I trained so hard because I don't want to have that. I had to experience in thai boxing one time when I run out of gas. It's not fun and especially in you no longer around and with an opponent seeing you know, is he getting tired now? They get wings, you know, they turn it on and you're in a bad spot there. Yeah. It's the worst thing in the worlD to see an opponent notice that you're tired and he's not. He's coming after you and he starts dropping low kicks on you and punching you in the face and you can't do anything. Your Body's not cooperating and they get worse because then your breathing starts going wrong. The breathing patterns not too relaxed anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:21:42       You have to stop flexing because the punches are coming. I'll take your stamina even more away. Everything goes down. Open. Stamina is a weapon. It really is. I mean, look at nick diaz who was a guy who fought so many guys and outwork them. I mean the frank shamrock five's a perfect example that fight. He, he just kept popping them with punches like 50 percent punches, but he's hitting him and he can't breathe because when, when I punched persons punching you, even if they're punching you and it's not full blast, you're still tightening up so you don't get a chance to breathe. And nick diaz doesn't get tired. Does ultra marathons? The fucking guy swam from alcatraz twice. He's in incredible shape. He's done triathlons. I don't know if he's done ultra marathons, probably take that back, but swimming from alcatraz is a fucking crazy endeavor.

Speaker 3:          01:22:27       Done it twice. Well pedis for instance, I thought he was never going to lose and the only time she was losing what's against guys with great stamina, you know, clay guida and an rda who just keep pushing the fight, you know, and in the grappling grappling. Yeah, I think physically pedis is not strong enough for those guys. Guys like dos anjos that just put it to them or eddie alvarez just put it to them. The physical, like they turned it into one of those grueling wrestling match. I mean I think his take down defense is pretty good and I think his grappling is not bad. I mean he won the title with an arm bar, but I just think physically when it comes to these grueling exchanges, I just don't know if he's physically strong to fight that fight with lego dosantos yup. Or even eddie alvarez and in that.

Speaker 3:          01:23:09       In that fight. Yeah. Well footwork. Again, they're gonna he needs, he's going to need a lot of forward laker mariah's. He stopped staying down by. Well he didn't even stop and just moves out the way he moves out of the way the lights guys up to and in his power to. That's a big thing in pettis has a lot of power to me. I'm not counting pedis pedis could easily come back and win the title again and he's a monster, but I, I never expected him to lose. I thought because she has this complete package, it was she a great striker, the great submissions, takedown defense. I go, okay, this is the guy, put them on a weedy bucks. You put away ceremony even better and more impressive than dos anjos. Yeah. That was the craziest dos anjos. He hurts her one and battered him up against the cage, but I thought that the stoppage was so weird because like looked at the referee and he's telling the referee stopped the fight and dosantos has serone sororities turtled up and he's still covering up.

Speaker 3:          01:23:57       I don't know when a fight should be stopped in that situation. When a guy's guy gets hurt to the body was obviously hurt, but dos anjos is hitting them and cowboys covering up. Like when do you stop a fight? Like if a guy's covering up and you're hitting his arms and he's talking like he's trying to get back up to his feet, like when does a fight get stopped? When is it okay? Because some referees wouldn't have stopped the fight. Yep. No, you're right. Here's a perfect example, right? Chris weidman versus luke rockhold. When luke rockhold got on top of chrIs weidman at the end of the round was beating the fuck out of him. I was saying they should stop that. Like he's not defending him, but like that's not the same as like the cowboy cerrone dos anjos fight. I'm like, man, that was a little bit of a more controversial stuff because you're still is a defense.

Speaker 3:          01:24:41       No, they shouldn't. They shouldn't stop the only one wIthout coming in and do. If he doesn't, doesn't cover up. he's going to get hit with a punch. So he's got to cover up and when you're covering up and the guys boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. There's not a lot You can do. Yeah. If you got to put your hand down to get up and if you put your hand down and get up, you're going to get tagged. Yep. So it's kind of, it's, it's almost like a guy can have a fight stopped without you being in real trouble. Although cowboy was certainly in trouble. Yup. But it's, it's a weird little kind of a. It's up. It's so subjective. It's up to the referee to decide the decision. That's why I don't want to be a referee. It's a very hard decision today. It really is just never good.

Speaker 3:          01:25:18       Yeah. Great. But you did for the safety of the photos. If they don't, you know, drawn to go out and they don't defend them. I should've stopped right away if they really, because they don't. That's why they're doing it. Right. I mean, you, you know how uh, like a big jaw and he tells me that I, I've seen him doing it against the fighters, into the dressing room. He'll tell them, do not come to me after the fight that if you lay on the ground to the guy who hit you and you're just bugging up, I will stop the fight and he says it two or three times. Do not come to me after the fight and complain about it because you know right now improve your position and sometimes you, you don't see that. I'm also, it's for instance, a guillotine attempt. So or, or you see guys who defend the guillotine like you're standing still and I go, don't defend the galaxy. And you know, go for position, make sure that you get close, you hold a heads to make sure

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       he doesn't jump guard because if you defend well, look at that militate against henzel. Gracie in the ifl use definitive did yoga. He jumped garth. Now he's got them now. Rhonda rousey against carmouche. You know she's got a crazy crank on the, on their head and instead of defending what people say, oh, differently the defendant. No, no, she didn't. She's had to position. She grabbed the foot, feet unlocked to fit and she got out. She took a chance that she took a chest and that's what people should do on the ground also. They said to me, yeah, but if they hit you, I said, escape, buck up, move to this. If you bulk up, they're going to have to look for balance. Make sure they never sit on your chest, push them always to your belly. If you can push into your belly, you hold a nice and you push yourself up or it's same result is sitting on your belly.

Speaker 4:          01:26:46       But you gotta go. You gotta move how easy it is. Is it for you if, if somebody mounts you to go to put them in, at least to have god? Well, you got to. It's real easy, right? I think a lot of guys don't train off their back then. It's the craziest thing. It drives me nuts. Get them into gartman y amount position. It shouldn't even be happening. Go to the side mount position when they could stop you. It's only when they put the stretch, you out a hook, their feet, you know, but then there's not a lot they can do because she just stopped their arms. So it's interesting when you see the different levels of, of their game off their back. Like Brian Ortega, have you been watching that guy? Jesus fucking christ. His triangles are good. His guard game is so good and he's one of those guys.

Speaker 4:          01:27:27       He's like a gold standard for how to fight off your back. Yeah. When they get him on his back, he is just that packing attacking you. You're not going to get him stagnant where he's just lying there waiting for the referee to stand them back up. That's when you've got that kind of a ground game off your back. It's A totally new dimension for your opponents. They're used to taking a guy down and maybe throw in some body punches with him. You're fucking defense defending the whole tags are up on your neck and you got to try to pass her up and get outta there. That's the gold standard and that's what everybody should aspire to, to have that kind of a dangerous ground game. Yup. That's why I thought, um, for instance, uh, Johnny Hendricks is a wonderful thing. No, no, no, no. Oh my god.

Speaker 4:          01:28:10       How could I forget him? He was carlos condit, the international bulk carrier. I was gonna say. Yeah. I mean I thought a conduit honda because he's constantly attacking underground, you know? And if somebody is on top of you and he hit you once every what time? That shouldn't count. If destroy undefeated, if it, if it goes through a decision and nobody get really hurt, but the guy who's constantly attacking is going to win the fight. Right? Okay. Why so why doesn't that count on the ground? Just because it goes on top doesn't mean he's winning. No. How about the fact that that's how you want the title versus kevin rowlanD down random? Not even with submission, that example, but like, man, that was shook you down and you just kept attacking from your back. Yeah. Mccarthy said later, I didn't put them back on a fit because boss was working from his bag. That was the reason they didn't put us back on the feet. But you know, if you have a gay guy, psychologists content or what, you saw a lot of pride, also great

Speaker 5:          01:29:02       groundwork and a constantly attacking and then they get rewarded for that after the fight. They actually win the fight and it should be because people go, yeah, but the defense is no, no. It's not about the defense. Same as the strike. It's not about that. It's about a guy who takes the chances because we all know if you have somebody in the guard, you go for an arm bar as I possibility there's going to be an assignment. No, that's a worse posItion for you. So you're taking risks and if you're willing to take those chris, they should be rewarded. Well, how also like pride. I like that 10 minute first round. That was good. It makes it, makes it more strategical. Yeah. He really can't burn out in the beginning. That was the thing with bankers in the beginning, but 30 minute fights. That's why the arts came on my hands because that means holistic, which is relaxed because I was such a hothead in thai boxing like somebody hits me, god there might just knock them out, you know, and I go, man, these japanese guys are known for being tough.

Speaker 5:          01:29:52       If this happens, the first three minutes I get 27 more minutes ago. If I'm empty, that's not a good thing. So stay calm, stay calm, and you start to be more strategical. So pancreas, was there any rounds or was it just know 30 minutes at the end. In the end there were a few under, unlike the undercard for 10 minutes fights, but most of the time was, everything was 15 minutes and the title fights and the end was 30 in the beginning the first year. And a half minutes. Three minutes. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's a real strategic fight. I'm a fan of that though. I liked that. I liked that too. But, but you know, and again, if you look at some ufc fights where they just lay la la, then you know, in the old days, whoever without a standup and then it becomes kind of boring.

Speaker 5:          01:30:36       But that was one of the things when I moved to pancras always tell this story, but when I saw my opponent, he was 45 pounds heavier and I asked when, the way in was, he says, there's no way in we everybody fights, everybody go out. it's great. Nice. Well, I was just bluffing of course. And I go, okay, so how many months? We got one round, one round. Awesome. How many minutes? Thirty. You'd go. Oh, awesome. awesome. When I look at my manager, I could lose 30 minutes, 45 more pounds on me as opposed to a three minute kickboxing for. That's what I was thinking around, you know, boxing, kickboxing. Yep. Yeah. So yeah, that opened my eyes a little bit there. and you become more strategical. That's a good thing. Well, it's also good for grapplers when they work, like say if you have a five minute fight or a five minute round and you work for four minutes and 30 seconds and get the fight to the ground, you only have 30 seconds to try to secure a submission.

Speaker 5:          01:31:25       Whereas if you take god to ground a 10 minute fight in your format in 30 seconds, now you have five minutes and 30 seconds to try to finish him. Which is a lot of time. Yeah. But you know this, there's always the other side of the middle of you know, you, you can say, well they should have taken them down sooner or are these guys and say, yeah, but I just need more work on the ground. Well, just go faster. This is the game you after that they not the other way around. Yeah. Well you could definitely look at it that way. What do you think about fabrice overdoing, returning against king? I think it's a. It's Going to be a great fight. I think again for the. Okay. We know

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       that the Seminar Played a big factor is huge, but um, for, do man, he's only been on an, on an arrowed as going straight up since. Since pride. Yeah. I mean always that fight that he lost against the allister, eh, really loose. I think if you would count the punches and kicks that alice, I get it because I was afraid at the time because I was at. Ellis does a, it was a big friend of mine at the time and I go, oh, because for doom hidden more connected. More on. He blew his knee out to in that fight. Yeah. see, so striking now with codero there, they're working really well to get a say with rda and everybody there, they're doing just a phenomenal job or was just what a great striking coach. That guy. Yeah. He's done an amazing job. Yeah, because he's a, he's an.

Speaker 4:          01:32:42       You could talk to the guy. They barbecue together today. You know, he's there in your best interest. That's duane ludwig. Same guy tompkins. All these guys. There are all. The way to. I remember stories was sean, we will come home partying five, six in the morning. He would go straight to as if it was the day of the way in straight to the soul. now with the guys putting them, helping them focus mitts, if they wanted to lose weight, he never ever missed a beat, you know, and then like a dwayne has adults, a lot of trainers out there, but there's a whole bunch of trends, you know, as well as I do who don't have that. Yeah. Well you got to be completely obsessed to be a great treat me. That's what makes ludwig so good. He's completely obsessed. He is. And that, those. I mean, it's the same with a fighter.

Speaker 4:          01:33:25       It's the same with anything. If you're not completely obsessed, you're just not going to reach your potential. That's it. You need to like it. Also, I was talking about that yesterday. It's um, you can have all the talent if you don't like it, if he hear fighters, which blows my mind always when I hear quintin french, he says, I hate training. And I go, wow, I love training. I want to get tired, I want to try new stuff. I always loved it till the end when I got my tendonitis and everything started hurting really, really bad, you know? Then you can't even think straight anymore. That's when I stopped. But before that, I always loved it. And if you love something, you know, same in school. When you work at, you know, math lab, I don't even math, but you were good at the things that you liked.

Speaker 4:          01:34:05       Biology. I love biology. Boom. Ace, you know, it's, it's all the things that you like. You automatically do your best. For example. Yeah. If you're a passionate person, if you're passionate about what you're pursuing, you're going to do better than a person who's just doing it as a job and clinton has so much talent and unbelievable power. He's got a fantastic chin. Yeah, right. Writer wrote up, pops up, right? always. Always. When you talk about quinn is the first and the arched even backwards. Yeah. He didn't go straight up. He actually went a lIttle further and then that was the most spectacular slam kayo and the history of mma. Ricardo arona had them locked up in a triangle and quintin slammed him into oblivion and headbutted him too, on the way down. I mean inadvertent headbutt, but slammed them and then bought by then his head slammed into him too. Oh my god. That was a horrific fight. Ricardo ricardo never, never recovered from that.

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       Well, ricardo, I read the cool story about kevin random and he was talking a read on. Sure, doug, that he said he just fought kevin and he won. He says for I wasn't addressing wound by myself and in Japan was nobody there and you know, I was just aching and he said, because I would just want to the most important fight of my career. And he said suddenly he sees his shadow and he thinks it was gentleman. So he automaticallY said at that time everybody was fighting. It was before or after. It didn't really matter. It was this fighting thing. And randleman came in and he thought there was going to be a fighter reynold liftgate walked up to him and said, dude, great job. Congratulations. You know, you're awesome. And he blew me away. He said it rIght away. I saw the monster as a different person. That's so hard now. Also with random and uh, you, you know him. Everybody who knows him is such a good guy.

Speaker 1:          01:35:45       Yeah. He was a great guy. He was a really friendly, happy go lucky guy. It's so unfortunate, you know, I don't, I don't know what happened with him. And what happened with sean tompkins. How did sean,

Speaker 5:          01:35:57       you know, this was the saddest thing ever because when I went to the funeral, his, um, his, uh, he was in a coffin and I didn't want to see that. I did that one time with a friend of mine and I didn't like that. So I said, don't want to do it in his mother. It was so sad, man. It's uh, she came to me crying and she said, oh, he was in, he was home and that weekend she was going to tell him that he had to go to the doctor because in the family that runs in the family, that they have enlarged hearts and he needs to check that out. And that was what was going down there. He was no drugs, no, not because people start, of course, the conspiracy theories, they didn't find anything, find anything. And the crazy thing was I talked the day before we, sean, it was so weird because then you guys announced it on uc.

Speaker 5:          01:36:42       It was. I go, whoa, sean. So I started. I started googling, but he, it was so weird. He texted me something and I thought for some reason I thought, oh, he wants to talk to me because normally we would text. So I picked up the phone and I called him and he was going out with a muscle beach, one of our friends that we'd call the muscle beach and he was um, he, he muscle beach was drunk and he says, by can't leave a man behind. I'm going to stay with him, you know, I'm going to make sure he's going to be okay. Boom. And he kept going and the problem that I was reading about didn't even come up. We start talking about everything. It was great, great diaries as part I love you, you know that I really love you. And then finally when we hang up, he started texting, you know that I love you, tom. The whole team tompkins loves you. It was really weird. He never did that. And the next day he passed away. So it was almost like he felt that it was going to happen. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:37:34       Crazy. That's crazy. Yeah. He was another guy that was really loved by the guys that he trained those relationships between trainers and students, trainers and fighters. They're so important, you know, and it's so hard for a fighter to find the right trainer, the right train of the fits, their personality. Someone who's technical, you know, someone who has also that emotional bond.

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       That's the thing, does 100 percent commitment. That's the thing. And it was being a fighter. It's soul sound cool. And that's why a lot of guys don't make it because they only want to look cool. You know, you don't really fight foot to fight. Like once they fight a start fighting for money, you know, don't do that. Then it's going downhill. Yeah. But I needed a paycheck then don't fight. Find it, find another job. You need that commitment. You need to be 100 percent emphasis. Same with the trainers. You know you can be off for a little bit because this guy is going to go in the ring or in a cage and you have to make sure that he's going to stay safe. Yeah. When you see a fighter that's only fighting for the paycheck, it's very rarely works out, which is very rarely.

Speaker 5:          01:38:37       We're not at a championship level, you know? I mean it miGht, it might be okay at a journeyman level, you might pull it off if you're tough and you're Skilled, but to beat the best guys, you have to be obsessed. Like the best guys are obsessed. Yeah. You want to be the best. It's not about Payday. I said, I said, that will come if you are the best, the bay, they will be better. But focus on getting good at fighting for yourself. I always say, you know, don't put your family number one spot. I understand you want to do that, but you know, once you start, that means that you care. Care care. It's a very. How you say it, it's a selfish. It should be selfish. You should be. I fight for me, I don't care. The way I explained it to my, my, my students is when they, for instance, they are nervous.

Speaker 5:          01:39:22       I say, okay, well let's, let's take a step back. Imagine your opponent now and you will go in a room. They loved the room and you guys going to compete against each other. Whoever wins, it doesn't matter who wins. When the door opens you, both of you are not going to say who won or lost. Nobody's going to say, do you really care if you lose at that moment? And he goes, I know. Yeah, because. No, because yeah, he's just a better fighter, right? I said, so why do you care? And then they start realizing, ah, it's because the people more, but he might think this and he might think this and see. And that's why I always say fight for yourself. If you lose, you give a joel, you are always a winner. It doesn't matter. You know what? Bad is not going all the way not using all your potential and then lose.

Speaker 5:          01:40:06       Because you didn't do that, that's something that after a fight you're going to say, oh man, I could have gotten harder, so why didn't you? You know, just leave it all out there and if you leave it all out there, there's no excuses and every other fighter will really enjoy you winning or losing. How many fighters do you have? Who, who never became a champion, but out here, all the other fighters talking about them, she, oh, you fight him. Oh dude, that guy's crazy. Yeah, you better prepare now because it's going to be a nightmare to fight that guy. You see? That's what I think is the most important. If your peers like it, the way you fight, you're good. You can't really lose. Yeah. worker guy like chocolate dell where he has that incredible fan base because he always fought with everything he had and whether he lost by knockout or won knockout, people still loved him.

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       That's it. Didn't lose a friend. I always use chuck as an example and that's. And that's what every filenet tell my students, look at chocolate l, I want you to be like that. Leave it out there, you know, I just want you to listen to a little bit more because if I would get in chuck's head, you know as soon as chuck hits somebody, that's the same with benji radic day, have one vision and that's the knockout, and they forget about the rest defense defense as say, as soon as you hit somebody, step back, you're going to have some time. Don't worry, but you just Hit the head, okay, what is she going to protect? No, the head go for the body. Do what crosses across to the body. Nobody does it, but do it as hard as you can. Cross hook, cross and a left hook to the head.

Speaker 5:          01:41:35       Bob, bob, boom. Suddenly there's a lefty to that. If you do the crossword cross, it's a heart issue. Can you will force them to block it, which will open up for the left hook to the head. Same as with the body body ahead too. Bloody bloody hood that go papa, boom, but the book I said, yeah, won't work like that. You see a ricoh over hoover who does his first mixed martial arts fight, body, body, boom, and then the head. Now bit the first two body shots. If this guy doesn't block him, he's going to get knocked out to the body, so now he respects your power. That's what Mike Tyson did. Spleen might, upper gut. He hits you so hard on the spleen that the second time when he loads up or you, he thinks he thinks it's going to be the same punch, but then he changed his angle to an uppercut and his defenses here for the screenshot.

Speaker 5:          01:42:19       If you do it powerful and heart, it will work, but if you do a buddy buddy hair bite about it, you know it's not gonna work. Make everything count. Yeah. A lot of guys are trying to conserve their energy. You buy what I did after a workout, I will put it back on the ground and it would 30 minutes, just go punching on a bag on the ground, rolling into god giving you don't get diane from there. Come on guYs. You don't really get that as nothing there. You can just go. What is she going to do? If he's on his back, he's going to hit you back. It's not going to hit you back. You got to watch out for submissions, but that's not get get you in, in, in trouble with your stamina. Just go. Just go. do you think now looking back when you have these tendinitis and all these other issues, will you too tough for your body because that what it is?

Speaker 5:          01:43:04       No, I, I. What I think is that because I was so sick as a kid that they, they overflow. We with cortisones. I had so many cortisone, so where was I? I was, I believe it was like 46 pills a day. I took all. I had really bad skin disease. Yes, I was. So I had a lot of stuff that I took for that and, and the, the tests they did on me, I mean every week I had to go get 20 shots, 10 shots in each arm of what they would do. They would inject a little tiny bit of where you are alert for and then to hopefully it's like the flu vaccine. They hopefully the body finds a way to counter attack that, but every time when to do that I'll be sick and so I needed to recoup from that the whole time and I think eventually the cortisones because they're really bad for the bones and attendance.

Speaker 5:          01:43:51       I think the court is really got my tendinitis. That's the reason. That's interesting. I never heard that before. I've never heard of anybody having. Well, I never heard of anybody having that many shots as a kid and then going on to be a world championship fighter. And the craziest thing is that when I was young I did track and field and I did it a pretty high level already because I wanted it to be the next bruce jenner at the time he was my hero. You know wHat I mean? That's how old I was. He was the guy, the decathlon guy. That's what I wanted and I remember in the end every time with javelin I had, I already had that tendonitis and I started recognizing that and I don't know why it stayed away my entire career and came back only at the end. It's got to be the gods wiLl of god telling me, okay, it was good fighter, you know, but um, for some reason at the end it came back, but I remember the pain from when I was 14 years old.

Speaker 5:          01:44:45       Do you have a desire to train like championship level fighters because I see you're talking about what guys don't do correctly in which would like to see them do, like, do you have this desire to get involved with someone who's like really trying to make a run at a title? Oh, you know, I, I enJoy things like for instance, a rico roofer came in last week. I love that. Can, you know? Yeah, because she's an athlete, not just champion ethic gLory, heavyweight champion, amazing kickbox. So when he said he was going to do mma, I send them an email right away. I said, listen, rico, come to me. Give me two hours of my time. I'll, I'll show you things. They got to be very, very helpful for you. I'm not looking to be a coach because they don't have the time for that. I'm way too busy for that, but I can get you in two hours.

Speaker 5:          01:45:26       I can get you a lot of inflammation. Or like for instance, John jones is a while back. I was interviewing him and then he said right away I was in albuquerque. What are you going to do after this? I said to my hotel is amanda, you train me. You sEe those guys who really want to learn and they want you to start learning and these guys listen and then suddenly they start being more explosive with kicking air and they go like, this is, this is crazy. You know, like sound effects. I do a lot. It had high pitch sound effects. If you see somebody, for instance, if you do the focus mitts or you hit a back, you go pump, pump, pump pump one, two, three, four like that punch. And so if you just stop or you go in your mind, you go just do that.

Speaker 5:          01:46:04       And then just by doing that your body automatically will adapt and will get more explosive. And he realized that. He goes, well, and the next week or two weeks later, we had greg jackson on the show and greg tells me, he says, man, what, what, what have you been teaching and what do you mean? He says, everybody makes these crazy son. I said, do they hit faster and harder? And he goes, yeah, so, you know, so it really works to get in people's heads. Yeah. And then if you have an athlete, like an athlete like jones who will listen to you. Yeah, that's gold that came to you. Have a guy like that came to you and said, listen boss, I want you to train me. How is that something you would be interested in doing? There's going to be harder. It depends whether you know the tv show now to new podcast that elder to jim and I met, uh, so much stuff.

Speaker 5:          01:46:56       The world shares of fighting that I suddenly cannot do because then we got to have 100 percent commitment. You know, I like a lot because I'm a very basic guy. Everything is basic, the basics with me because everybody forgets the basics. So most of the time when when somebody comes out, like tim silvia, a little while ago, he came to my gym and he threw the left hook wrong and I, I tell them, I said, man, just can be way harder. And he started learning to throw the hook without loading up and he wanted his fight in 15 seconds with a left hook. He goes, this is crazy. It works that I enjoy to give them an hour time and show them what they do wrong. And then if they actually listened to it, they realize why wait a minute, I got more power. You know, I don't try to change the style.

Speaker 5:          01:47:38       I just showed them how you get maximum power and if you mix it up between your styles, that's up to you. But I see you have this incredible passion about this guys and about working on technique. That's why I'm, I'm curious like, have you ever thought about like, just going into training and. YeaH, no, it's, it's um, it was too busy, too busy, but also, um, I don't now anymore, but you know, a lot of guys that you do over the years, so you put a lot, you invest a lot of time and it doesn't work, it doesn't work out or they get a better deal somewhere else and they just leave you in a year. She does with a lot of fighters, you know, and trainers that finally the trainer has something or a manager and then they just kick him to the side because I'm going to save 10 percent here are going to, you know then.

Speaker 5:          01:48:19       but, but then again, those guys, most of the time you see them losing, you know, because you broke the winning combination. If you have something. My stretching routine and everybody always says please post is because you always talk about this. My stretching routine is the same as it was when, uh, when I started in [inaudible] 93, well that's probably even before my karate. And I say, you never changed it. I said, no, I never change her. Why wouldn't you do more access? Because with that stretching routine, I never had a problem. Why would I change it and they've given me a problem in training is he. So now if I start adding things or subtracting to certainly I get injured. Just my own fault. I had a winning combination. Never always helped me. Let's not break that. Let's keep it the same. And that's what everythinG.

Speaker 5:          01:48:59       Yeah. It'S just. I know that you have your gym and thousand oaks. YeP. You know what's it callEd? The westlake village. Her boss woodlands elite. Mma and you. It's mostly a recreational peoples. That is, that's it? Yeah. Tuesdays, thursdays. I'm there at 6:00. you know. What kind of classes do you teach on? Tuesdays is mostly striking. [inaudible] only striking a thursdays I start with ground but only like for 20 minutes because people want to work out like the fight. If I took five classes with the fighters here, we do a lot of growth to escapes and reversals. I always start like that. That's how I trained. I never started on my knees with grappling. I always lay on my back and I tell my partner, you can take any position you want to, gordon. So important is the most important thing for a bad spot. You put yourself in a bad spot and figure out how to be comfortable in those bad and work out of them all the time.

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       That's it, you know, and the basics. I had an a student one time coming over to me and after class and he said, boss, you know what's funny? I said, tommy, he says, I've been working in now for three years and you're teaching the same stuff. I say, yeah, that is funny, so you wouldn't have something more funny. And he goes, yeah, I say, you're still not doing it, and the reason I'm doing this is because if people like you, because you guys don't listen, look around. Yeah, they don't. They don't do it every bug to forget the basics. They all want to do Just spinning becky's to the head, the breakfast and the crazy elbows and doing that. Forget about basic stuff. A simple one to how many times in boxing you see a Knockout, highest level of the planet who will do the trick is just the timing and when you throw it, the timing, the efficiency of the technique and having it down where you own it.

Speaker 5:          01:50:35       Yep. That's it. Yeah. So you're enjoying teaching. You enjoy teaching couple times a week. You enjoy doing that. That's why I'm doing it. And here's your striking class. Were guys sparring in there or are they mostly working on technique and it's all technique and my classes you go like you see girls in my class, but I still like to double love double right. I can tell them any combination of people who are watching diego, like whoa, what is this? But they've been with me for awhile and they're very technical, you know, and they, they do really well with the striking. Like yesterday again, they were laughing about it. She still goes, always worked together. Lora and dina, that they're really good. They're probably gonna listen to this also, but I said, listen, everybody throws a low kick at the end. for instance, a combination with a low kick, but once you do that in a class at the local, they have their hands always down, so I let him do it to me, that combination.

Speaker 5:          01:51:23       And then just before they make kick, I stretch my hand in front of the face and I said, I want everybody to do this because I just walked around. I said, and as we're only three people from the likes of 22 or 24 people, there are, we're doing it, you know, just keep your hands up, just make, you don't have to hit him. Just be aware that I could be a punch, you know, keep your hands up. And I walked over and they said, where are we? One of the three. I say, you know, you were one of the three because you guys are always doing it. It's Just an a habit. Make it good habit then don't lose the habit. But unfortunately a lot of guys lose it. Now what is this podcast you're dealing with? Moral. And that was one of the reasons why you guys wanted to come in here together.

Speaker 5:          01:52:01       And like you said, unfortunately moral got sick, but you guys are doing a podcast together. We're doing a podcast or rutan and brunello. It's called a written and all. And it's an itunes soundcloud. It's everywhere. We, uh, it's a, it's a really fun. People have no clue who morrow really is. You know, they start now because the pick peas on shore doc, you know, he's bipolar, you know, and he just goes up and down. But the guy is a genius. Like there's no prompt, there's no nothing. He just like kenny rice for instance, same, same, you know, they have a brain, you can ask him about a horse in the 1989 and you will know in the name of it, it is a moral. And um, and I told you the story before here with a pro wrestling the gig that he now has, the people are raving about him everywhere. All, even the pro wrestlers say, did, did a best guy I ever had. And I told access stevie when once they hire morrow. And, uh, George Barnett to do the progressive new Japan pro wrestling on tv. Uh, I told him, I say, you watch marvel was going to work for the wwe. After they hear him doing this, he's going to get a job. Mark my words while he's doing everything now

Speaker 1:          01:53:08       doing that. He's doing showtime boxing. He did a bunch of glory fights or this is your,

Speaker 5:          01:53:13       this is a landing page. Beautiful. Rutan rinella. Written down the episodes. Have you guys done so far? Seven tomorrow. Tomorrow's the seventh and tomorrow is dedicated to kevin, kevin randleman. We got to have his wife on the Mark Coleman on and we're going to talk about his life and all the funny things. I mean, I got such a crazy stories with kevin. I mean, I went to his wedding with my whole family and it was so my family destroyed. I mean, they want to go with us to the funeral. Everything was uh, uh, you know, it, it was so sad. The next day after the wedding, we were all at the pool. People laying down, a little hung over, you know, and then suddenly there was a waterfall, fully bald net and somebody started to play volleyball and you know, all these competitive guys there suddenly this big themes on side with the kits we're going to town and everybody's wonderfully. it was such a good time. We had such a great time. And then, you know, things like, uh, a thing like this happens. It's a, it's reallY upsetting.

Speaker 1:          01:54:11       It is, it is. He was, he truly was a great guy. I mean all my interactions with him where he's always laughing and smiling and hugging people. And I remember I ran into kevin once we were at the fights. It was a smaller organization. It was, there was some fights going on in vegas and kevin and I ran into each other at the concession stand and he gives me this big hug. What's up man? Man. And then other people will come over and it just fans, fans coming. Oh, hey, what's up kevin? He was like, hey, how you doing man? Hugging everybody and smile. I'm like, what? I'm fucking jovial guy.

Speaker 5:          01:54:41       You know, the first time I fought and we fought and only met one time, the fight before when he beat morris smith or to make the picture indication that became the poster later. That was the only time I met him. So now I'm in the hotel and I think before the weigh ins and I'm waiting for the elevator, I'm by myself. The elevator door opens and there is, he is and he doesn't go. It needs to be in. So I get into the elevator close now we're with the two of us in the elevator and I'm looking, but I can see his face in a mirror reflection there and he already has a smirk on his face. No smoking. And look at him. And I go, you know,

Speaker 6:          01:55:14       good luck tomorrow. And he goes, thank you. He says, you hit two and I got here, thank you. And I will look. And he says, if you keep your feet on the floor, I promise you I won't take you down. And I go, really? Okay. Okay. He knows that he gets notice. Crazy guy. So either if you keep your feet on the floor. So no kicks you crazy. Crazy deal. Yeah, right. Well that's strange

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       deal. And so, um, so in the fight, the fight starts and you'll see in the fight was it starts, the first thing he does, he slept his thigh, like kicked me. Right. So now I'm in. So I go, oh wait, he's gonna think I gave him a low kick so I've got to act like you give them a lucky but gave him a front kick to the face so if he will wants to time it to take me down to get him square in the face. So I move, I make a front kick and it goes just in front of it and he's backing up. I just miss him with the front kick to the face and I see something in his eyes and I pulled his day. I couldn't have told this data while after I couldn't figure what it was. But in his mind he of course thought I thought we said we're not going to kick, you know, but he did that slapping thing on his thigh. So it threw me off. I thought, oh no, he wants me to kick him. Okay. So I guess that whole thing was not real. Let's start kicking, you know, but he got me because I kicked it, took me down,

Speaker 4:          01:56:43       and then the only the front could get missed. He backed up a ca would have been fun. Well, there's always gamesmanship, you know, it's definitely a lot of that. Oh, I was talking to him the whole time, the big john wooden in his book, because I was literally. People were bullying because laying on a garden I say, listen man. I think friends would like, it's better if he's trying to negotiate to go back on their feet, you know, I think is a good guy. Yeah. He was a great guy. He's a great guy too. You know, you guys were a part of the early days of mma. I mean, you are one of the original pioneers of this sport without a doubt. I mean, you're fighting with the osha course. Soccer for the longest time I had that poster. There was a poster for the, your announcing your fight with.

Speaker 4:          01:57:32       She said the world's greatest martial artists boss route and that's how they uh, announced you. I mean, they were, they were building you up because you were like one of the first really elite strikers to fight an mma, you know? Yeah. They always, they always said, I said, I said they messed up right there on the post and they forgot to world looking. The greatest looking marshall out is. I told him that, but they forgot it was a good time, but dumb man. Then when you look back on it, I mean it's got to be pretty amazing the time that you came along mean from becoming a king of pancrase from entering into the ufc and the ufc heavyweight champion. Like what, what number was that? Ufc 18 and 20. Twenty. I became the champ. Wow. Almost a 200. No, that's incredible. It's crazy. You know. Then why it was such a great honor. The hall of fame when they said the also the pioneer section because the pioneer section is a section that I will only grow so far. Yeah. It will not show even in 2000 years from now. It just keeps going and whatever because the new olympic, but it doesn't matter. We were always the ones that started it, you know, and that's a cool thing and it was a cool. I mean it's, it's

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       crazy also that this is the oldest sport in the world really fighting it is the oldest form of competition, but it's also the newest sport because there's no sport from 1993, which is when the ufc first started is no sport from then that has exploded a new sport that came along in 1993. That's exploded. And now in 2016, I mean you have ronda rousey's on the ellen show that we've talked about today. The economy, greg or joel dos anjos fight is probably gonna get close to $2 million pay per view buys. I mean, that's going to be fucking crazy. You're dealing with the sport that's exploding, just exploding now. So it's, it's so strange that this is this combination of things. The oldest sport is also the newest sport and you from the time you started competing, you caught it like right at the beginning of the wave. Yeah. That's it's, it's really cool. It's um,

Speaker 5:          01:59:30       it's an amazing feeling. Many times fence ask, wouldn't you want to be born like 20 years later? I say, no, I'm perfectly happy right now and then I'll show the way I wrapped it up. I didn't lose him. I lost 22. Five is a great way to stop while I'm ahead to every week I keep going. She, if I get home and what, what vin? One more, you'll lose. You win or you lose, you know, like that's not a great way to wrap up a career. Know of course injuries with me played a factor, you know, maybe I got the injuries because they said, hey, it's been going really well man. You got to stop now in know because you're getting older and you don't want to admit that you get older because she's still explosive and you still want to do it. Then you still train with guys.

Speaker 5:          02:00:08       When I came back, I trained with the guys in vegas and I go, did everybody looked at me? They said, then you have a second career. This is the craziest thing. I said, yeah, there's this crazy right. I'm feeling so good. You know, I could have ended a warm. I couldn't to do 20 minutes of warm up when I started because I didn't train for three and a half years and six weeks later I'm not taking breaks anymore. I just go into the next opponents. I was, even myself, I am a single man. This is great. And then all the injury started coming back and now I go, okay, now I got it. My knees, my tendinitis. I tore a hamstring, pull the rip, rip out at the place at the dan henderson's place, you know, they took me down in the mid air. I reversed the take down, but with that I use so much upper bodY strength strength that I popped the rip out. So now there was 12 days before the fight I couldn't punch anymore. Can point you back. The only thing I did was the workout. I have the audio workout in the air and it was the only thing I could do. Wow. Yeah. So what you got out of this, the sport

Speaker 1:          02:01:06       with your faculties, 100 percent intact, that is the ultimate goal of any fighter to retire. And especially you because you're now a commentator, you're also an analyst, mean what you do, a fantastic job of breaking down fights, uh, really enjoy you on inside mma because you have such a knowledgeabLe perspective. but also you're very honest. You don't play politics. You're very honest about how you feel about a fight coming up about where it guy fucked up. but we're where a person's chances lie. And I think it's, uh, it's, it's amazing what you've done. It really is amazing. Thank you. You're sharp ever.

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       I, you knoW, I, I'm almost trying not to get hit, you know, it didn't really work in my tunnel fighting as kevin because he'd beat the crap out of me, but the first four minutes, but, you know, but after that it was okay for the rest. I don't think I ever got hit, you know, I, I always try to, you know, slip and move or fighting intelligent is most important aspect of fighting to use your mind to use your mind and proper tactics and techniques. That's why I love mighty mouse. Mighty mouse is on. Yeah, I agree. I mean, I don't think there's any competition. I'm think jon jones is a phenomenal talent and he's an amazing fighter, but I think it's, it's almost disrespectful to put him as pound for pound the best when you look at some of the wars that he's had with gustafson.

Speaker 3:          02:02:23       I mean the war that he had with daniel cormier was daniel. Obviously he's a great fighter, is a really good fight in, you know, john won the fight of course clearly, but you look at what mighty mouse is going into. The competition doesn't even get hit. Dodson is a fucking freak. Yep. I mean dotson's a freak and dotson just couldn't touch him. Dotson. Elvis said in the beginning, it's like he's glued to the ground, like he moves back. You'd never slipped. She never just grateful to work, but the man dj who met tom did a really good job. That's a really, uh, that's. Yeah, that's a whole new level where he's got so much going on in his mind. He's very smart. He's very dedicated. He's got a great control of his ego. He doesn't fight like a fully fights. Very, very technical. His footwork is fantastic.

Speaker 3:          02:03:06       He's his choices that he makes it a fight. He's unpredictable in his movements. It's Just, I think he's the best ever. I really do. He needs to guide to fight like a carnival gregor though, because. So he has a big payday one day because rafael dos anjos is going to make a lot of money. This fight, you know, if a 2 million, if that's really going to hit it. Yeah. And, and you watch that, we'll probably get up also if he, if for some reason mcgregor wins this because you're going to be very hard to fight for him because I think a dos anjos yeah. It's going to be verY tough fight because we saw with mendez. Yeah. Well we'll, we'll noTice. Same thing, you know, once it goes to the ground, but you still don't know in that fight. He is so aware of where he is.

Speaker 3:          02:03:43       When he fought mendez and I talking about mcgregor, he was Just laying on the ground, you know, he didn't even try to escape. It was almost like he said, oh, he's going to run out of gas. Mendez tooK that fight on two weeks. That's what I mean. Just different as you could have done that. But he knew that. That's what I'm saying. He knew, oh, I'm just going to carry it into the second round and I'm going to get them, you know, didn't even try. So I think once against the rafael dos anjos yeah, he's going to need this. Go into the garden. That's one thing for sure. It's a different aniMal. He'll be there every minute of every round. He'd be There for 25 minutes trying to kill you. Yeah. Dos anjos is a fucking animal man. He's an animal. It's a different animal. Totally different kind of a fight. So I'm so curious as to how that's going to play out. When you look aT how obsessed connor is with footwork and movement and being smooth and fast and laying like one of the things that he said when I was interviewing them after the fight, he's like, no power lucy, that no power, just precision, just precision.

Speaker 5:          02:04:38       Like all those come out. He just drops out, punch in. I mean, he's not, he's not grunting. He's not. He just drops it in and boom. It takes them out. The thing is I see him everywhere, so I hope he's not gonna make the rousey mistake because I said it two weeks before. I think what she's doing is not good. She said, every talk show every mexican I go to the supermarket, three magazine covers. I mean, iT's insane. Stopped doing that, you know, fight first, fight first. That makes you big, you know, once you lose that, all the other stuff that you're doing right now is going to go as well because they want that champion, you know, so mcgregor, I hope that he keeps, stays focused and only picks the ones that he needs to do contractually. And that's It. Yeah. I think he's going to be a lot smarter about.

Speaker 5:          02:05:24       I think rhonda just got overwhelmed with the amount of superstardom that came her way. Unprecedented him. I mean, there's never been an athlete like that before. This female ass kicker who's on top of the world. I mean she was a new thing and because of that there were so many temptations and, and that's why for her it's also what's so, so hard. When she lost, she was such a high, you know, and then boom, there you have such a low that well does the auto, this is how your opponents could have felt, you know, and I think that kind of stuff, you don't want one side, it's really good for her because now she understands that now she's going to go, oh, okay. No, I tasted the other side. You're going to make you a better person. Then you start reminiscing about all the things.

Speaker 5:          02:06:02       Did I, you know, what I owe and that interview I wasn't really. That wasn't really cool. You know, those things are backfiring once you said losing as mcgregor, the same thing. Although with him there's always. It's a funny thing, you know, with rhonda, it's real, like real, real, but mcgregor said, will he do the reason is so unbelievable. He good? Is he in his mind? He truly lives. There's no way he could lose, you know, and a guy was a guy like that. Mendez hit them hard. I mean heart and he didn't even flinch. There was no zero, no movement. Crazy. It was the craziest thing we sell. Mendez took out ricardo lopez, ricardo lamas rather, luggage mendez. It's fucking hard. That's a hard area. Connor Just eats it. Each on the tip of his job. It was not like, just crazy. Yeah, his chart, his jaw is incredible.

Speaker 5:          02:06:52       His mind is incredible. I'm so fascinated by that fight. so fascinating. He says, we're one for one of us, goes to order. We all go to work all the way back. When he said that, remember in boston was that. That was, that's where he got me. That's when roadway. I said, okay, this guy, that's why we got to worry about on the inside of way we wanted and then the next time it wasn't inside mma. He says, man, I got my water grabs look in in my suits. How cool is that? He was so happy. He got his name. And did you ever see the video? Oh, I did some homework on him because we were going to interview him and I saw this video. It isn't a hotel and in in dublin I believe, and there's coconuts to just see that boat now. Okay. So he's talking into the camera that's shooting this, whatever you is the following him around to suddenly,

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       here's why wife going no way. Right. And he goes, he's talking to kevin, he looks at and says, says what? He said, no way. And he says the one second. So he walks over, she, she comes with a coconut and there's a hole in there that put a little cork thing in there. So he goes, no way. He never saw it. Coconut. So they pull the thing I think with the straw and go or no way. You think they did this for a bit because I have to fight a brazilian guy and that's why they put their start reminiscing and that is a knock on the door. So He opened the door and he has the cognitive dissonance. This trainer at a trade that sees the co, he does her, the trader goes, no way. Everybody does. It is so funny. And then you see him at the attic.

Speaker 4:          02:08:18       He lifts at the attic from his mom and dad with his wife the attic and he's putting a suit on and he's trying to figure out a thing in the pocket, you know, and he goes, I don't know how to do it, but you know, I, I think in a few years from now, I will say though, it's, this becomes second nature and then you see him now. How cool is that? You're really there and now all the way up there. Good guy. Well, he's making so much money now. It's unprecedented. I was talking to dana on the phone today and dana was saying he's going to be the first guy to make $100,000,000, although made $5,000,000 from that last fight. Aldo did $5 million, $5 million and all those going back to Brazil with that moneY where it's worth probably like who knows, 15, 20, something like that.

Speaker 4:          02:09:01       I mean in, in, in, for a guy like aldo who loves Brazil and loves to be in Brazil, that money goes a long way in Brazil, you know when you can help a lot of people in Brazil with that money to. Whereas if you bring That money to America, I mean $5,000,000,000 in los angeles, you can get it in house and then it's gone. But in Brazil he can, he can hold onto that money for a long time. well, who knows how much current is going to make in this dos dos anjos fight and even if he loses you still defenses, featherweight title, which is crazy. What if he fucking wins? If he fucking winter, then he goes up and fights robbie lawler at welterweight. Oh yeah. Wonder boy, it's going to be insane. That's what a boy has. The same kind of timing that he asked is different.

Speaker 4:          02:09:44       I always talk about distance as yesterday in my class. I said again, the most important thing if fighting fish, keep your nose pointed to your opponent because if you say ice that they think looking away dishes is not keep you full vision and distance. You know if you, if you manage to stay just outside this reach and then you can counter, it's golden. That's what. You know what a boy wonder boy has that no one has his karate kicks. He's got the front leg side kick to the body, the front leg roundhouse kick to the face when he was fucking Johnny Hendricks up with that. He front leg side, kick them to the body and then frontline roundhouse kicked him in the face. You can see hendrix was like, whoa, what is this? Yeah, he kicks in a way that no one does. No one. Like when he wheeled kicked allen burger ellenberger was saying before that fight, those kicks are a waste of time. He's like, I think it's a waste of energy. All that spinning stuff.

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       He'll kick some hope solo is a big fan. Did you see that? Oh, hope solo made. I made a video message for wonder. Boy loves him. How cool Is that? Amazing. Yeah. His fight with hendrix was his coming out moment like where you really got to see him with all of his work that he's done with wide and his take down defense and his wrestling and you're seeing that kickboxing that we always knew we had with the 57 and o kickbox is. You think you're seeing it come together inside the octagon. Where is all these other mma skills have caught up with his kickboxing? fuck man, that guy is good. Yeah. You something. I was so impressed wiTh that fight with hendrix. I was so impressed with him when his father said it before. If I was talking about the distance, you know, I go, oh, well let's see.

Speaker 3:          02:11:18       And then when I saw it, The footwork, it's like a snake. He's like in and out and he wrestled. Did he has to be right? I mean, how does he stands? He's, first of all, it's done a lot of work with weidMan. Him and weidman trained together a lot and also he's carlos machado. Son-in-law. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. So he mean he's learning jujitsu, I'm sure from. I mean, I don't know what belty has under that, but jesus christ, that's a high level. It's a beautiful thing to be connected to that. How. How did I hear something that he was going to be like family of light minnows. What was the connection to. Is she going to live there now while he trains with them a lot. There's a big wide men, of course, elite wrestler. No, ncaa all american. I mean one of the best wrestlers right now in mma, so to have a guy like weidman training, I knew that they do a lot of training sessions at hofstra.

Speaker 3:          02:12:06       They'd go down there and do a lot of work with the wrestling, but that's what he needed. He needed to be able to confidently stay on his feet and not worry about executing the kicks because you see them earlier in his career. He just didn't. It wasn't loose, it wasn't loose the way he is in a kickboxing fight. Did you ever see him in the world combat leak? Chuck norrIs's organization? Oh my god. You see them in pure kickboxing. You see what a talent. This kid is just incredible and we're going to watch it, but it's so unusual because iT's hands down and loose and in and out like a snake. Trying to find a guy who emulates those. I mean leona machida is obviously got great karate skill, but wonder boys on another level. it's like several levels past that. The combinations that guy throws.

Speaker 3:          02:12:50       Like when he hit hendricks, he's tagging them and then as he slide now, roundhouse kicks them in the body and then he slides back in and hit them with another combination and then he slides out, slides back in again and hendrix is just overwhelmed. He never saw anybody do that to hendrix. Yeah, I think um, what's interesting to try with guys like that elvis said this with cheeto show and even with conor mcgregor and when he fought aldo and, and, and in this case now as well, because the stance is so karate white, right? But it's a karate with low kicks there used to here iN America, you know, so I'm, I said to my buddies, I imagine that I'm the camp former aldo said four months ago. Listen, you're going to face mcgregor eventually is going to happen. Let's switch you to south pole so we can use your left low kicks.

Speaker 3:          02:13:41       It goes, the way they stand, It's going to be very hard for them to get away from low kicks on the outside inside is easy because what mcgregor does, he lowers himself and once his knee goes in the same line as this, but so to say, you don't, you don't have any space to land that inside located. It's really weird. If you angle it up, the angle is gone, but low kicks in that stand outside located outside low kicks froM the southpaw stance, from a southpaw stance, powerful loki. So that lag, because if you stop the legs, you're going stop every. Well nikki holtz getting Raymond Daniels because raymond danIels is a very similar style. Daniels, of course it was a karate champion as unbelievable kicking Talent, but nikki hall skin stays glued to him and throws leg kicks. It just chops them down, chops them down, champs him down, and then beats them up.

Speaker 3:          02:14:30       And that's the same thing with joseph valtellina st did the same thing with Raymond Daniels. Yep. Chop them down with low kicks, chop them down with low kicks. And then he had ticked them and knocked them out of linea is also something. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. But he's another guy that he. He had to relinquish his title because of concussions and he's going to do the podcast soon. We're Talking about him coming on the podcast because he wants to talk about some of the situations he's gone through dealing with concussion syndrome. Wow. Yeah. And he's young. Yup. Yeah, just hard training. Hard fights. Nikki holds can fight was hard. You know, he's had, he sent some fucking wars, you know, he has see in training we never. Like I never get knocked out thankfully, but I could hit a few times, but never, you know, not every workout for sure, like ones that are just so many time.

Speaker 3:          02:15:17       It will be good to have good sparring partners. It always happens when you go somewhere and then one of these at a boxing club, but ceRtainly a boxer jumps up, hey, you want to go for your run? And then it goes harder, harder, harder, harder, and then. Yeah, well that's one of the smart things that Conor does. Connor keeps all of his training partners very close. You know, he's got all these guys got gunnar nelson, he's got a bunch of different guys that he trains with on a regular basis and he keeps those guys very close to him and everybody's got a common goal. Everybody's trying to help everybody else. Everybody's trying to get themselves healthy so that they're going to be stepping into that cage at 100 percent. That's it. Winning combination. See, he doesn't break it. Winning combination. He takes everybody from Ireland, but just come with me.

Speaker 3:          02:15:57       Very smart, very smart. I gotta get the fuck out of here. Boss, route it, but I appreciate the fuck audio. You're awesome. Anytime. Invitation.
