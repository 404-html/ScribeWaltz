Speaker 1:          00:00:00       And Stefan Molyneux correctly. Dancer name. Right. That is pretty good. I mean, you did not believe the, the DV issues. I think some people just cough it up with the thing on hairball. What the hell they're doing with my name. Correct. But it's like French, French, not like we're back French. Okay. What is the difference between Quebec, French and French? French? Um, well, you know, like the Queen and Cockney as sort of the difference. Right. So Quebec French is like the gutter at least by the French next. Instead it would be the gutter, the gutter, French or rude. I know it's going to be very nice people, very nice people in need. And for the French who look down on people after the Second World War, it takes a lot. Anyway,

Speaker 2:          00:00:40       folks listening to this where we're in Toronto right now. Uh, this is the first time I've met stuff when I met him just a few moments ago down in the lobby. But I've seen a lot of your, uh, internet videos and I was particularly impressed with several of them, but really the, the Trayvon Martin one, I think you covered that better than anyone I saw online on TV and the media, you gave a real, you know, the quote, the Fox fair and unbalanced. You give a real fair and balanced approach to that subject. And to me personally as a human being, that was one of the most, uh, frustrating, um, events of our day, not just because a young man lost his life, not just because of the, the, the race baiting that went on with it, but the cloudy, muddy thinking that I felt was perpetrated by the media and by politicians and by all these people that we're looking to capitalize on that event. There was the, the, the, the thinking was so disingenuous and they were showing these photos of him when he was like a fucking baby, you know, it was, it was really confusing stuff to me.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       And do you actually, if you looked at George Zimmerman over time, the pictures got wider and wider. Like they actually applied photo retouching to make him look lighter. Oh yeah. I mean it was, it was like gets stopped those style propaganda. It was just wretched. Wow. I didn't know that they did that. And you know, they edited, um, his nine one one call. Right. Really? Yeah. So, um, so, uh, Zimmerman called and he said that some suspicious guy rolling around the neighborhood and then the, the dispatcher said, well, what is his race? And he said, well, I think he's black. And NBC edited out the question. So it sounded like this is a suspicious guy rolling around the neighborhood. I think he's black. Like you just, wow. He was actually responding to a question. They edited that out. The woman lost her job and then, and he's now suing NBC for defamation because they edit it to make him sound like a racist.

Speaker 2:          00:02:37       Well, you know, I don't know if it's really bright for him to be involved in the further in the legal system, but I think, you know, what they did was, uh, it was horrendous. It was, it's

Speaker 1:          00:02:46       very strange. It was very strange to watch. You know what my approach and you know, we'll say we want to live in a colorblind society and I think that would be great. So for me, I always try to try and look at it like, well if he wasn't black, what if he was just some other white guy? What if they were both black? I want if they were both rainbow colored with dolphin heads, I don't know. Right. But what if it had nothing to do with the, the, the, this was a black energy around race, the negative energy around risks. And so for me, I really just wanted to look at it like, you know, that Joe Friday thing, you know, what are the facts? What are the facts, what are the facts? Because I really have strived striven and it's hard to do in this culture to just treat people like color doesn't matter. And that means that you don't get to play the race card, you know? And, and I think it really would be great if we could achieve that seems so hard for people to get it.

Speaker 2:          00:03:32       Well, it's too common. It's like, it's almost, it's just as a natural part of our culture, we weave that pattern has been so firmly established. That path has been so deeply carved that people just slide right in.

Speaker 1:          00:03:45       Yeah. Well I wonder too, you know, this, this horrible shooting that just happened, uh, in the navy yards. Yeah. In Washington. Uh, Alexis, I wonder, there's no proof of this yet, so all bullshit hiker hypotheticals, but I wonder if this guy was a black guy and apparently he had a real chip on his shoulder about, you know, I'm not going to get ahead because they hate me. That why he hates me and all that. He had a real chip on his shoulder about being black and trying to get ahead and up, like willed or whatever. I wonder if the degree to which they did not intervene in his is obviously escalating mental health problems with, because they were afraid that he was going to launch some complaints about racism or something like that. I wonder if that actually scares people off from dealing with people just like they're human beings because they're afraid of that car getting pulled. And then getting dragged into something got off.

Speaker 2:          00:04:28       Yeah. Well, it's almost like we're still responding to the echoes of the imbalance of the past that, you know, the slavery era echos and the Civil Rights era echoes of the fifties and sixties. It's almost like we're still not even the ship hasn't, we haven't made it level yet. You know, it's almost like that's why this stuff is, is still tolerated. It's, it's very confusing to me though when it's, uh, it's so obvious and so blatant. Like it wasn't this case. Um, it's also very frustrating to me because as a person who deals with a lot of martial artists and a lot of people with the anger issues who have become, you know, really incredible members of society and really, uh, admirable human beings, people who've learned to harness this, this frustrated energy that a lot of young men have with if they grow up and confused households or whether the absentee parents or bad neighborhoods or whatever the factors are that lead them to be these angry people that can be channeled and it can be channeled into a way that develops character.

Speaker 2:          00:05:36       And it doesn't happen. So when I see a guy like Trayvon Martin do what he does and get shot and die and all this, I see a massive loss of potential just as a human being, a young human being, you know, a young human being, the commits crimes and does bad things about 18 he's not even necessarily a bad person. What they are more than anything is just misused potential and misguided. A human being is so incredibly complex. There's so many facets and aspects to being a person and developing as a productive member of society that it needs guidance and most people don't get that guidance and it's up to them to kind of find it.

Speaker 1:          00:06:14       I mean, you see an unbelievable tragedy like that. I always think of like all the, the terms of the steps and the other possibilities that might've happened early intervention, some teachers somewhere, some relative or someone who would have just seen something going off the rails and really stepped in and made a difference. I think that title away, it can be stopped early. I think once it gains real momentum, it's tough later on because we to turning around. But you know, early intervention, uh, really, really seeing people who are going off the rails and then really working to intervene. If we could get that down as a society. And I think we'd live in a different,

Speaker 2:          00:06:48       well we would, I would absolutely agree with you. We would work live in a different world. But it's, it is very, very, very difficult to do and incredibly difficult to pull someone out of that momentum. The men momentum of being a bad person and you know, and almost reveling in it, you know, which is a big aspect of gangster rap

Speaker 1:          00:07:07       or you know, they've, they've done some really interesting studies where, cause you know, they just over the last 10 or 15 years ago, we see inside the brain, like for the first time it happened again. This FMRI, you can really see inside the brain and they found people who, they've, who'd been identified a status and they show them pictures of people being hurt intentionally and they're like happy joy centers light up that little like bring dancers. That's so messed up. You know, cause it's like opposite, cause we'll all think we've got this thing from religion. Like everyone has a soul and we're all kind of equal. Oh, made in the image of God and this and that and the other. But it's according to this, people I've talked to in the research that I've done, I mean there's some real predators among us who really are not kind of like us at all. And it's somebody who like cs, you know, some cat being driven over and he giggles and like finds that really quite thrilling. I mean that, I didn't even know what species that it is, but I think there are a lot of people out there that they make life.

Speaker 2:          00:07:59       If I go for the rest of us. Yeah, it's a real issue. It's very scary. And how are these people becoming that? Is it because of nature or nurture? Is it because of, you know, abuse that they've personally suffered that sort of stimulating?

Speaker 1:          00:08:12       Yeah. Well so I mean this is the fascinating thing about epigenetics, right? So, I mean, when I was a kid growing up, there was this nature versus nurture. Like you got your, if what you're born with, right? And then maybe you can influence it a bit with nature. But what they're finding out now is that genes turn on and off depending on experience. So they found like if you have a particular gene and your boy and you are physically abused as a child, almost for certain that you're going to end up, you know, on the bad side of things, like you're gonna end up violent, aggressive criminal J or whatever. Right now if you don't have that gene, you're abused like you heard, but it's less. Uh, and so certain genes for aggression get turned on and strengthened based upon your experiences. You can end up deck twins who grew up in different households can end up with different genetics based on their environment.

Speaker 1:          00:08:52       So that's what's so important about, you know, something I focused a lot on, is it parenting? Parenting, parenting seems to be so many people that are out there and they're just so messed up. Like you just, you can't rewind and you can't send them down a different path. But if you kind of look at the next generation, the next generation, what if we could have the percentage of people spanking their children down from 90%. I mean, it seems so weird in the 21st century that that's how parents are really focused person depending on where you counted, 80 to 90%. It's less so in Europe, like in, in Sweden, I think it's been banned since like 1973. And y'all know what a hell hole, sweetness, yeah, they're doing fine. But um, yeah, it's still 80 to 90% in, uh, well it's legal. It's legal in America from two to 12.

Speaker 1:          00:09:33       You can hit a child in Canada legally, just not at the face and not with an implement. Um, so it's just, and cause these are the most vulnerable, tender, helpless, dependent, you know, lack of freedom, members of society. And uh, but it's, you know, it's hard to see how our weird society that we have. You had this great bit last night. Go see the show. Anyone has listened to. This is my show. We did this great bit like what a space aliens come down and try and understand. You had Kim kind of ask you in which of course is tough enough, but, but what if they tried to understand that culture? It wouldn't make much sense, but you realize that the hierarchies and everything that we have there, the wars, the prisons, prisons, the prison guards from wards, you need soldiers, you can't get healthy, happy, well adjusted people to go out and do that kind of stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:10:15       So I think our whole society relies upon the maltreatment of children. And if we didn't have that, a lot of people that got a lot of money and power right now would kind of find themselves out in the cold. Yeah. I don't necessarily think that it's engineered that way, but I certainly think it takes advantage of the situation at hand. I don't think there's a secret cabal, secret handshake, but you know, lions get together to hand else. They don't have to plot it out in some smokey romance. It's just their instincts to go get the guns.

Speaker 2:          00:10:40       That does get sort of a hypothesized though, right? The that that is what's happening, that they're trying to keep people down with a lack of education. That's why there's such little funding for schools and they're trying to keep people poor because poor people don't raise their kids correctly and you know, and so on and so forth, and then it continues.

Speaker 1:          00:10:56       I think we have an instinct for domination as human beings and I think animals do too, and they don't have secret cabals and Rockefellers and smoky rooms organizing everything. I think we just have an instinct for domination and it plays itself out, but I don't think it's something written down and handed out in the secret and rails scrolls or something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:11:14       I agree with you. I think we also have an instinct for escalation, you know, and no matter what, we always want more, you know, if we make $500 a week, we want seven. If we, if we control middle of the Middle East, we want to control Africa, we want to, it's just, it's a natural thing that if we do a certain thing, we will continue to do it and try to push the envelope further and further until we hit some sort of a wall or resistance. But I think in America we are starting to see that wall built up and, and gain momentum. The wall of resistance against the Syria. A invasion was bigger than anything that I'd ever seen in my entire life. I'd never seen a university across the the entire country go, fuck this. Yeah, this is crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:11:56       You're not, this might be the first war. It's actually stopped. Yeah. Like in history, so you'd be the first war that popular was an resistance has actually stopped against all the financial, military, industrial complex momentum that is in the states, which is huge. Right? I don't know if you know the fact that the people who vote voted Yes for the war in Syria get 86% more funding for the military industrial complex and the people who voted, now that's just voting to send money in blood to the donors, right? I mean it's horrible. Uh, but, but the half that it might actually be pushed back. And the fact that the Russian guy that Putin is telling the recipient of the Nobel peace prize to not have a war, it's upside down universe that we live in.

Speaker 2:          00:12:39       And you know, and not only that, but Putin said a really interesting thing about, about claiming that citizens of the United States are exceptional and how dangerous that is and about how we are all just human beings. And to have anybody established as being the exceptional people is a very dangerous idea. And for the United States to sort of promote this idea that we as Americans are different. Like, yeah, that's, that's, he's absolutely right.

Speaker 1:          00:13:08       If an individual displays that characteristics, they're called entitled or narcissistic, which means that just good things come should come to me no matter what. And if they don't, they're not brought to me, I'm just going to go take them. And that's a really dangerous personality trait. But somehow it's elevated through the magic of patriotism until like wonderful stuff. Right? Yeah, that's fine.

Speaker 2:          00:13:24       It's fascinating. I mean, and as I get older, I find it even more fascinating because a guy like Obama, I'm 46 the guy, look, Obama is just a couple of years older than me. So it's not like this thing where when I was a boy and I would look at the resident, yeah, they were way up there. There were different then, you know, it was, there were always a part of this system already. Political System, educational system, skull and bones, all that. But this Obama guy was the first guy that doesn't fit that mold to me. And it's close to my age. And you know, the concept of me being a president, it was just the most ridiculous thing of all time to me. But this guy is essentially my, obviously more educated than me, but essentially my age. And I find it amazing how he has gone from being this political outsider, this rebel, this guy who was going to change this closed Guantanamo Bay and, and then all of a sudden he gets in and he's exactly the same thing that we've seen time and time again over the last eight years. It's easy. The same person as Bush. I mean it's, and more and more, more drone. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:28       More detainees. Uh, and, and the only reason he ended the war in Iraq, it was quite fascinating and tragic, you know, if you have hope for the guy, right. The reason that they had to pull the troops out of Iraq was that Iraq was, was going to start holding the troops criminally responsible for what they were doing because they were facing such resistance from the population for the occupation. They finally said, okay, you guys don't get to get out of jail free card anymore. We're going to start applying international military or military law. Your and Obama's like, okay, fire up there, the airplanes, we're going to pull those buggers out because they're going to be subject to the rule of law. And they had to get him out of there.

Speaker 2:          00:14:58       Well, how about what he wrote on his own website, the change.org website about whistleblowers and then removed it, you know, after it would was, he was called out on it after the Edward Snowden case, like they said like what did you say about whistleblowers? What did you say about whistler? Blows were exposing illegal activities when you were running for president and now here you are the most as far as presidents go. There's never been a president that has been harder on whistle blowers then Obama never, nor have there been more revelations and more important revelations as far as the direction of society and privacy in the United States that was exposed by these whistle blowers. That has a massive impact on our culture. Massive impact on who has the right. Do you, do I have a right to send a naked photo to a friend as a joke or is that going to be held against me? You know, if, uh, I don't pay my taxes or if, you know, I have a dispute with the government over a certain issue. Are you going to pull things out of emails because they have someone writes bomb and an email, you know, as a joke. Does that get flagged and,

Speaker 1:          00:16:05       and just a comedian, that's a word you may well use. Yeah. Yeah. I mean not now. I defragged I don't know what you're going to call it now and kind of use that word anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:16:13       Yeah, I mean, but there's a lot of hot words and to me that's, that's a dangerous thing to I think what we're in right now as far as the whole privacy thing is this strange transitionary period to a point where I think ultimately there will be no privacy. And I think, I don't think that's bad because look, we were all really cool and everyone was really nice to each other. Privacy wouldn't be as as important. It becomes important when people violate privacy and there's stalkers and there's, you know, people that fuck with people and people that you know or have agendas to mess with people's lives. But ultimately privacy, what we're dealing with, inflammation and the trend in society and technology seems to be the dissolving of boundaries between people. And information. And I think it's been amazing as far as education. When you look at your phone, you can Google something, you get have answers to any question. I mean this is, we live in an amazing time when it comes to that, but that trend, you know, we've talked about escalation. It's just what we do. We're getting that trend will escalate further and further and I think ultimately it will escalate to the point where they'll be no more secrets.

Speaker 1:          00:17:23       Yeah. I mean I, I mean the technology that we were having this conversation, we can broadcast it to like millions of people and I got like 50 million downloads of my shell, which for a philosophy show is incredible easy. Right? But this is huge, right? So it's like these two bullet trains going across the landscape, right? And the technology of control versus the technology of illumination. I think it really, really battling and we got to keep pushing the gas to, to stay ahead because we've got this incredible thing. Uh, you mentioned it, the end, the show recently, like the gatekeepers are down, right? If we get half this compensation, broadcast it directly to people, nobody has to tell us what we can talk about. Nobody tells us what words we can use or what concepts we can explore, anything like that, which is unprecedented except maybe for the Gutenberg press and like 15th Century.

Speaker 1:          00:18:04       When they printed the Bible and started handing it out to passes in a language they could actually understand. Because before that you had to know Latin and all that kind of crap. So they got to read the Bible for the first time and like, Oh shit, I'm getting me. This is in here. This is in here. They started to develop their own thoughts about it and that broke down the monopoly of the Catholic Christian did mine, which had been around since the dark ages. So when you get information to people, you fragment the central narrative of a society, which is great. You know, that's, that's what you want. Central Narratives are incredibly dangerous. You know, we had a great central narratives, the Nazis that wonderful central narratives about the role of the white race to dominate all the other races in Germany's manifest destiny and Europe. Communist had a great story about that are, you know, raising the proletariat destruction of the middle classes and the end of the bourgeoisie narratives that are really well inflicted and universal are incredibly dangerous.

Speaker 1:          00:18:50       So all the lemmings we're on the same way. So we've got this massive airstrike on a central narrative which comes directly out of this technology, which is where you can get exposed to viewpoints that you never would've been exposed to before. If you think before the Internet and American media would be playing anything that Vladimir Putin said about Syria, you'd never even know the guy said anything and totally road. Now you can get it all and you can connect with people. I want to talk about that. The comedy stuff where I think the connection stuff is really a good theme in the show last night, but there's rice because the degree to which we can shatter the central narrative and individualize what we're doing in the world is, you know, they're racing with us to try and control and make us afraid to communicate with each other and afraid to get to the truth and I really view that as pretty important razor for like the next 10 years.

Speaker 2:          00:19:33       Yeah, I agree. I think there's, the real issue in this world is a information and then of course the big one is the monopolization of resources and the monopolization of resources, which are I believe, I think resources should be in global asset for human beings. I don't think anybody should be able to control the amount of oil, just like I don't think people should be able to control water. I think it's ridiculous. The idea that a group of human beings decided to control water. I feel like that that's an act almost of terrorism, of social terrorism. The idea of keeping water from people that need water. You know, the idea of keeping oil from people. I mean if we all agree that we're going to use oil, the idea that one person can decide, you know, who owns the shift that has been in the ground for millions and millions of years just because you planted a flag on a patch of dirt.

Speaker 2:          00:20:20       It's fucking craziness. But that's where all the influence comes from. The influence comes from this massive amount of money that you can gain by controlling monopolize and natural resources. And it's just like when they used to be able to monopolize the information that was received. Just like when William Randolph Hearst basically controlled most of what information got out to people, read newspapers, that that's a dangerous aspect of our world. That is eventually, I think going to crumble under the weight of its own bullshit. I just don't see how it can continue. I don't see how people can continue to live the way we're living right now in the face of the information that we're being presented with.

Speaker 1:          00:21:01       Well, you know, the great thing is once you go outside and narrative, don't you finding? For me, I feel pretty retarded most of the time. Like I'm not dumb guy, but I see so much information out there. So many things, so many stories. I can do all this research for my shows and stuff like that. I feel like it barely scratched the surface because there's so much information about there. With the central narrative, you feel like, you know, well, you know, we were Catholic so we're Jews or we're Jesuit. So we got, we got it down, we got the whole thing down. Right? But the great thing is once you shattered that central narrative, you realize there's such a vast amount of conflicting information and opinions and perspectives and I don't know what the hell is true half the time, you know, I'm lucky to get 10% of it.

Speaker 1:          00:21:38       So I think that that breeds a kind of humility in us that that is the opposite of the desire to dominate. The desire to dominate is, well, I know what the hell people should do, and by God I'm going to make them do it. I know they shouldn't smoke marijuana, and if they fucking smoke marijuana, I'm going to round them up with cats in blue uniforms and throw them in that prison cell. You know, where 200,000 times a year they get raped. I mean, an American, more men get raped and women don't get it of habits. The whole prison stuff, right? Yeah. So when you feel like you just know how the health everyone else should live, you know, the way we should help the poor is take money from these guides by force, give it to a giant bureaucracy and have a little drops of it ripped down to the poor.

Speaker 1:          00:22:13       Have to keep them in it dependent state so they'll keep voting for more and more government. If you've really feel like you know exactly how people should live in what they should do, then you have no problem bringing out the air strikes at the military and the police and the prison system. But if you're humble and you realize that we're pretty much retarded and had everything, there's a few things that I'm good at, but most of it, you know, I'm not going to draw my own teeth and I do my own appendix. I barely even clean my own house. Right. But once you get exposed to a vast amount of contradictory information, you realize just like we're all kind of stupid and that's why we should be humble and not order each other around at the point of a gun, which was so addicted to doing these days.

Speaker 2:          00:22:47       Transplant out a great quote about that, about the bonfire of enlightenment, the one the, as the bonfire of enlightenment grows brighter, the surface area of ignorance becomes more illuminated and you realize the more you learn, the more there is to learn and then it becomes impossible.

Speaker 1:          00:23:05       Well, human knowledge doubles every 18 months these days. Like there's just no possibility that anyone can be anywhere close to mastering any, any significant. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:23:13       Well that's great though. I think that's great because I think there's a real danger in claiming, you know, and, and Clinton, that kind of arrogance that comes from, uh, especially very highly educated people in specific areas of you very highly educated in a specific area. They oftentimes are arrogant about things that they're ignorant about. And it's, it's interesting to watch that become an impossibility. You're faced with such a massive amount of data that's just online. I'm like Twitter every day. I'm exposed to dozens and dozens of

Speaker 1:          00:23:43       fascinating stories a week or two in each one.

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       We, because we've got to, if we've got to go up and make a buck or whatever, right? But just love to dig into all this stuff. And I'd love to learn every language there is. And I'd love to know every song that was. Yeah, but you can't

Speaker 4:          00:23:56       at least a small grasp of what the fuck they're talking about when they're talking about quantum physics. That's never gonna happen. I think once you understand quantum physics, it changes on it. It's one of those things. Grab fog. Fireman's quote was it? If you think you understand quantum physics and quantum physics, I, I've read so many articles on it. I don't know what

Speaker 3:          00:24:16       right it to someone, they'll say this is the amazing thing that just came out today, but I don't know what it means. Change at some geometric object that explains the interactions of particles. As long as my shoes, them attending distracts that he'd my feet because of some quantum flux. I'm okay with it. I know it does some creepy shit. Deep down. I know that also read like by the time it comes to the level of your sense like it all cancels out and you, you know, this is still going to be a table tomorrow, but deep down in the roots of matters, some really crazy shit is going on.

Speaker 4:          00:24:42       Yeah. Subatomic partners, apartments blinking in and out of existence, existing simultaneously, two different places in motion and still at the same time like what are you talking to me? We basically, what they're saying is that the heart of matter itself, the, the, the, the smallest measurable portion of reality is magic.

Speaker 3:          00:25:02       I mean that's really, you know, you're going to get emails from physicists saying, Oh, don't call it magic. It's not magic. It's just the little confusing. Thank you for correcting me and all. I had magic to us. But then these microphones are kind of magic to me. These little magic penises that record everything we say. It's amazing.

Speaker 4:          00:25:17       I had Dr Amit Goswami on my podcast who's one of the great quantum physicist of our age who is just impossible to understand. It mean it just, he would just go, it's gone so far into the bushes. It's talking magic. And I mean it's just, it's so strange. But that is the accepted smallest measurable part of the universe. And it's amazing when you really started to think about what we know about nature and nature of being fractal in so many different ways. The universe itself being fractal. And then when you get down to the smallest measurable components of, of reality itself being this strange fiction almost world, it's so bizarre. It's impossible to know everything. So I think this, this, this age of enlightenment that we're in right now is really unprecedented. I don't think there's ever been a time like this and once you break down the narrative, right?

Speaker 4:          00:26:14       So I mean my boring education's all the history of philosophy and science and you know, in the, in the, um, the renaissance and the enlightenment is when people said, well God doesn't answer anything. You know, God is a barrier to [inaudible] cause as long would you say God did. It's like all right, we've got an answer. I did it. And then it becomes something that's blasphemous, did the question. And so when people began to doubt the God thing, then they began to be able to explore, right? They began to say, okay, well if God didn't do it, what the hell did we get here? You know, what

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       is the world and what does the sun, how does it work in all that? I think we kind of get in there and in a really painful, difficult way. I think we're kind of getting there cause we've knocked this narrative and it's like in the future, I guarantee you it's going to be completely insane to look back and say people ever believe the shit. I mean, you know, the guys who kept their own balls off to go join that comment, you know, you look back and just say it wasn't, wasn't there. So someone said, you know, when you're bringing out the pink and sheers and taken off your tidy whities, there's gotta be someone who's saying, we were kind of going in the wrong direction here. But I think in the future I look back at us like that and say, what were they thinking? Like we have these geographical areas called countries and in those countries we have a tiny group of people with all the guns in the world and they tell everyone else wanted to do. And somehow we think this is going to work out fine.

Speaker 4:          00:27:31       I can't believe I wasn't recording. I wasn't recording up until just now. Luckily I have to get the first, whatever, 27 minutes. We got it. There we go. Folks who are listening to this will, will normalize this years are the meatiest, but the voice quality goes, I'm considering, I suck at technology. I'm sorry, I can't believe that this wasn't recording. But, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:27:51       again, Trayvon Martin, quantum physics. Well, you know, that, that's where we saw everything. We saw 27 minutes, we had the whole fucking thing down.

Speaker 4:          00:28:02       Well, I'll, I'll, I'll make sure it gets normalized. Um, but the, you know, the, the, the, the, I think that the enormity of the times we live in really, it's, it's really easy for us to not notice it or not. It's so normal to just be able to call some money on your cell phone. So normal to able to get on the Internet and just get information. I think the enormity of this as far as what is that, what that's like in comparison to having to go to the library, into getting your education from a school which you're getting, you know, if you're taking science, you're getting it from this professor and this professor is going to remote recommend these books and there may be a completely opposing point of view that you're never going to be exposed to. Whereas if you Google something, you know, and then Google that sprays and then do bunked. Yeah. Know, man, I have, I can't tell you how many fucking times I've had someone send me something and then I'll say Google when you just sent me and then debunked and then was talk

Speaker 1:          00:28:56       and if you haven't read that stuff, got to talk to me. Cause if you're only getting one side, it's not any side at all.

Speaker 4:          00:29:01       Yeah, you're not, you're getting this weird sort of confirmation bias, see thing that exists. What I've heard that argument as to why the Internet is bad, that one, one of the bad things about the internet is you seek out like minded people and you sort of confirm each other's biases and get together and you know, pat each other on the back sort of. Yes. But I feel like those are just little camps, you know, outside of the Wilderness of information, which is New York City, you know, like get my, you might have a tent where all you assholes get together and said that the earth is 6,000 years old. Right. But you know, you're, you're, uh, an hour's walk from Manhattan, right? You're not gonna, you're not gonna survive. Well, I don't remember all

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       those people talking about a unity of narrative and seeking out like minded people really complaining about say the Church that I grew up in or the public school that I grew up in, Brian was taught that, you know, governments are necessary beneficial, wonderful. And you know, we fought the Second World War to defend against national socialism and we won. And like we had, we already had that narrative. Now people are fragmenting into their own narratives, but that's still way better than one monolithic nonsense pile that we're all supposed to in mind. Right?

Speaker 4:          00:30:05       Yes. Yeah, I am. It's also like as a human being, what we have been given is this insane amount of potential in the mind and in the body's ability to manipulate matter in nature. But yet we don't have a real direction book and we're sort of figuring out the abilities of this mind and the possibilities of, of, of society and our interactions with each other and the accumulation of information that we can all rely on each different aspect of our culture to contribute. Whether it's, you know, a history or science or mathematics or, and all this stuff comes together and the potential of it as almost unfathomable. It's almost impossible to really truly wrap our heads around and we only figure out how to do things. You write by trial and error, we have to fuck up and then go, well, we can't do that again.

Speaker 4:          00:31:01       And we have to drop a nuclear bomb and go, well that's a disaster. And we have to, you know, it's, we have this incredible device, the human mind, and we have very little idea of how to utilize it properly or even less control or engineer engineered thought into how to develop people properly and, and to, to try to enforce that as a culture or to recommend that or try to just, I mean, when you see the president on television, what are they always deal with the leader of the free world? Well, they deal with conflict. They're constantly dealing with conflict and loss and finances and they're dealing with all these things that are important to people that are developed and how much thought is actually given to developing people. How much thought, I mean, how, what does the last time you heard the president United States talk about what we really need to do is focus on the lowest rung of our ladder with the weakest link in our chain of human beings and strengthen that.

Speaker 4:          00:32:01       Wouldn't we be a better country if we had less losers, wouldn't we? I mean, isn't that something we should concentrate on, but it never gets brought up. There's never talk about enriching poor neighborhoods or setting up community centers, finding ways to help young children that don't have guidance, brilliant people and have fucking companies like Halliburton funded. You want to make a lot of money rebuild Detroit, you know, fuck Iraq, rebuild Detroit, fuck going to countries and blowing them up and rebuilding them. Concentrate on what's already fucked up right here and it's never done. And it's, it's, we, we, we look at it in terms of,

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       you know, it's almost like going from going from presidential run to presidential runs, like these four year terms that they do in a, in a way, it's almost like the idea of having a president and having these small four year terms, it's like you're always going to concentrate on what, just problems as far as like conflict and money here, he's going to concentrate on what's on the tip of people's tongues all the time, but not on the engineering of society.

Speaker 1:          00:33:09       Yeah. It's, it's all here. No prevention. Yes. Right. So I'll just play whack a mole with whatever fucking crisis is coming up at the moment and it's not how are we going to make it so that society can be seen in 40 years. They don't care about any of that stuff. I mean that's why there's a national debt. That's why this war, because it's just about getting elected. Like the of the Federal Reserve just said, well we're going to keep buying $85 billion worth of us treasuries. Even though we said we were going to stop because there's going to be an election coming up. And what do they care if they pass the bill to the unborn? I mean they've gotta to be long gone. So we have this weird society that this these really narrow time slices, which is just all about, you know, whack a mole and satisfying the noisiest people and keeping those people too.

Speaker 1:          00:33:46       But the actual work of preventing in the long run, which is so easy, the science is so easy. It's so simple. You know, reason with your children. Don't hit your children's do treat them like they're reasonable human beings. I mean, I'm a dad of them. I've been a stay at home dad for like four and a half years. Never had to raise my voice and my daughter never had to yell at her, never had to hit her, never had to have a timeout. We just reason things through that gets not doing that about 18 months of age to studies show that can stop the reason they can start to negotiate. And if we had that, if we had that as a society, I can virtually guarantee you there would be almost no criminality.

Speaker 2:          00:34:20       I agree, but don't you think that there's an economic aspect of that that really can't be norm? You have the ability to do that and very few people do. That's the real issue is that so many people do. You have a working mom and a working dad and the kids, by the time they see their parents, they mean they're ready to go to bed. I mean it's four or five o'clock at night if they're lucky, you know, most of the time they see their parents afterwards. So it's six, seven, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:34:43       and they've been in there since eight o'clock in the morning and they're exhausted and everyone, they got to feed them, bathe them. They don't really have time for quality interaction. It's very different

Speaker 2:          00:34:50       called the idea that people have been sold, that you can raise a child and have a full career. I think it's madness.

Speaker 1:          00:34:57       It's kind of do it. You can't do it. Yeah. And this idea that daycare just kind of use you put him in daycare and that's fine. Um, it's just not true. I mean, statistically for actually scientifically there kids who are in daycare from other 20 hours a week experience exactly the same symptoms as those who have been abandoned by their mothers. Like it's, it's the experience, maternal abandonment at a very fundamental level of changes their neurological system. It changes their stress responses to changes that cortisol levels permanent, that you measure it 10, 20 years later. It's still the same. So this idea that you can just march, people have to work, hey, it's great for the government. I mean, government loves it when both parents work because then they got to taxes to tax basis to tax capital out there, spending money into the treasury.

Speaker 1:          00:35:36       Plus then they got to put the kid in daycare. So then there's somebody else who they can tax, who's taking care of the kids. So the government loves it really. Absolutely. GDP because everyone's working, they get much more taxes and the problems of having kids in daycare, well, they get shuffled down to the next generation and who the hell do you know it's about that gets done vote, right? Yeah. But what's the solution to that? I mean, it's going to be so difficult as a vice sacrifice, you know? I mean, I mean, people got a war, you know what I mean? Millions and millions of people went to war in the Second World War in the first world war. I mean marching into hailstorms and bullets and, and typhus and all that, going to horrible stuff that went on. You know, where we say to people, I say to people all the time, you know, you know, if you went to college, you know you live like a dog.

Speaker 1:          00:36:16       He most people live like dogs when they go to college for four years because it was a good investment. Well, take that same approach. If you want to have kids, you don't both have to work, just downsize, get rid of the second car. Just we're not asking you to go fight the Japanese, you know, in some godforsaken island in the Pacific. And it was just maybe move to a smaller house, moved to an apartment just a couple of years when the kids, you know, kids personalities, 90% done by the time they're four, you know, so all you got to do the first couple of years, just sacrifice. Have someone at home, breastfeed your child, look at and say, cause that's what nature intended and sacrifice. You know? So maybe you don't get the big screen TV, but you will know what you get is like a happy child throughout your life

Speaker 2:          00:36:53       and you get to develop a human being in the correct way. Yeah, it's, it's so easy for us to say, you know, my wife is a stay at home wife, stay at home mom and uh, you know, we have three children and you know, we're very fortunate and everything works out great, but I'm in a unique financial situation that can happen. Whereas I have a lot of friends that are not in that situation. They're trying to raise children and they're also trying to put them in daycare during the day. And you know, the wife just went back to work because we have bills and this and that and you see it and it's, it's not, it's not the way a child wants to develop.

Speaker 1:          00:37:27       It doesn't seem healthy. No. I mean historically, you know, you put your kid in the backpack, he went out and worked in the fields, you go hunting, you bring your kid. I mean, that's, they're supposed to be, it's so weird, the 21st century to say children's supposed to be with their parents and I'm a, how would we ever drifted away that, that even needs to be said, you know, what do you think that is? Do you think that's a, just a, a desire from materialism and some sort of a rationalization

Speaker 2:          00:37:50       that you can, uh, you can go after both, that you can acquire all these things and keep up with the Joneses and just have someone else take care of the busy work of taking care of your child when you do that? Is that what it is?

Speaker 1:          00:38:02       Yeah, I think, I think what happened was, and this would have happened in the sixties and seventies I sweat in the 50s this whole amazing series of labor saving devices came out, which freed women from the drudgery of dishwashers came out and laundry machines and vacuum cleaners and all that kind of stuff. Right? So basically a huge amount of work was done by machines now, which, which freed up women. Then of course a lot of them were like, okay, great, I'm gonna go work for us or whatever. But I think what's really been downgraded is, is the skills required to be a good parent. I mean, I've done some tough stuff in life. I've built, built businesses. I started this crazy show and all that kind of stuff. Nothing. To me, it's more exciting and challenging than being a dad. I mean, I know it's a cliche and it was all it said was wonderful things, but it really is an incredible thing to do, especially if you don't do any of the aggression stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:38:50       Cause then you got to come up with that other stuff. Right. Other ways of, of dealing with conflicts, other ways of dealing with quote bad behavior. It's really challenging now if you just spank and your kids and yelling at them, I guess it's not that challenging and hell of a lot. Not Fine. Right? Because all you're doing is spending your whole day trying to control someone who doesn't want to be controlled. That's not fun. So I think that because we've got this head Aman and put them in timeouts and send them to bed without dinner and yell at them or whatever. I mean that's retarded. Anyone could do that. You know, you can get an angry robot to do that. Right? But if you don't do that stuff, then you have a really unique challenge of negotiating with someone who's three. I mean, how exciting is that? What an incredible challenge that is. But because we've still got the hitting and the yelling and all of that, it's retired. And so people say, well, this is stupid and not fun, so I'm going to go to work, but it's only stupid or not fun because you're yelling and hitting. If you didn't do that and it would be really engaged

Speaker 2:          00:39:39       it. And it's the most important aspect of our society. The most important aspect of our family is the most important aspect of our communities is developing good human beings. And it's one that we leave to everybody. We'll just go work. I know you fucked your whole life up, but uh, take care of this person and that person will in turn transfer everything that you've taught them and that any way that you fucked them up or made them better and they're going to go out into the world and spread that energy. And it literally changes the tone of our entire society and culture. And it's fascinating when you see different cultures all throughout the world. If you study the, the, the different ways they interact with their children, how vastly different the, the culture itself becomes because of these styles of interaction and our culture, which is thought to be universally one of the most materialistic, selfish child blood cultures is one of the cultures that embraces this idea of the, the two parents working the childcare, the, you know, this, this, this idea of how we've decided to promote becoming a human being is one of the most awkward, weird examples of it on earth.

Speaker 1:          00:40:54       Could you imagine, could you imagine it's your anniversary, but ended, you got married a couple of years ago. You'd be with your wife a long time, right? Imagine it's your anniversary and she calls you up and she says, Joe, you know, it's our anniversary that for a nice dinner. I got babysitter and you say, Oh man, I can't believe what a cliche. I completely forgot. So sorry. Oh my God, that's so embarrassing. But I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll call up someone we don't know and I'm going to pay them minimum wage to go out for dinner with you. Now they may not speak great English, you know they mean, I mean they've never met you before, but I'm sure it's going to be pretty much the same as going out for dinner with me, your ever loving husband. So let me just make that call to the agency to send out some half broken English speaking guy to go out for dinner with you and it's going to be exactly the same.

Speaker 1:          00:41:38       She'd be like, no, it's not the same because you don't, my husband is some guy, I don't even know, but why the hell would we think parenting is any different? I mean how the hell you replace the bond of, of the new grew the bang and challenging New Valley and you breastfeed the child and you know that child. But I'm sure some minimum wage stranger who's rotating in and out of a job every four months is going to be exactly the same as a parent. It's not the same. And the consequences to society a significant, and it's, it's very frustrating to me when I communicate with him.

Speaker 2:          00:42:05       People that are, especially women that are single, that are thinking about having a child on her own. Uh, I've, I've had so many as I could and I get it. I get that they want a child and I get that they want a child and that they can't find a man. I understand that it's hard to find someone that you compatible with, but God damn is that a terrible idea? It works sometimes. Sometimes it works. Sometimes you get lucky and you meet someone and somewhere along the line

Speaker 1:          00:42:35       some people fall out of the building. And the way that doesn't mean that that should be your next step engineered. It's engineered that way. Those God such a disaster statistically. Right? I mean statistically and factually there's no single worst predictor for kids outcome then being from a single mom household. You know, and I hate to say it cause I mean again, there's lots of single moms out there really trying to do the right thing. Some single moms like how he got hit by a truck terror, you know, and they, you know, all the support, all the, you know, but the vast majority of it is, you know, it didn't find the man or just ditch the man or whatever. And it is catastrophic for kids. I mean the statistics are horrendous. Like 80% of rapists come from single parent households. 85% of murderers. I mean, not again, not that they all turned out that way, but when you see these significantly negative elements, a lot of it gets traced back.

Speaker 1:          00:43:23       This is theory that says that is kind of working this out fairly well. They say that, um, if marriage rates have stayed at the 1970 levels, right, cause you know, marriage rates are really low these days. Um, and marriage not necessarily the same as, you know, two people committing to say to get the mother, raise a kid, but we would have almost no deficit in government spending of marriage rates and stayed as they did in 1970. You know, when the majority, vast majority of us got married, stay married and so on. Because marital disintegration, I mean, getting a huge rise in welfare state, huge and criminality costs huge rise in, in uh, every everything you can think of in society that if you trace back the deficit, a lot of it has to do with this, this breakdown of the family, which is, I mean some people say it's all engineered and Abi, I don't credit the ruling class with that much.

Speaker 1:          00:44:08       Deviousness. Uh, but um, I don't even know. So I did. It is, it is something that is really has to be talked about. I mean, particularly for boys, I mean boys these days are having a real rough, you know, like the schools are really focused on, on girls and how girls learn and you know, boys, yeah. Oh yeah. There's the huge change has been a boys like to learn hands on. They like to learn viscerally. They don't like to just sit there and read about stuff. We'll see the teacher do stuff on blackboards. And about 30 years ago, a bunch of feminists said, well, girls are getting shortchanged in school and it's all designed for boys. And it's really shifted the curriculum. And since then or has it been just falling behind catastrophic? Like so 60% of like, uh, people in, in university does and our girls and you know, I think it's like nine times the number of voids around these psycho tropic brain killing meds are because they just, the boys don't want to sit still all day, but the society views girls as great and boys is like broken girls.

Speaker 1:          00:45:01       You know, if we could just get them to be like the girls and sit quietly and you know, with their legs crossed and all that. Uh, but why boys? It just getting a real reference school these days. And again, because they're growing up without dads, they don't have that role model of how to channel that aggression. And so, you know, it's real rough and this is why they just get medicated so rapidly and then it escalates. You talked about escalation escalates from there. You get one drug for Adhd and then you can't sleep. So you get another drug for that and then you start developing bipolar symptoms, you get another drug for that. And that all went down. I think he's getting so kind of you get another drag for that next thing you know, living in a facility for the rest of your life. It's masters

Speaker 4:          00:45:33       and that's a huge issue in the society. The amount of money and the amount of influence that pharmaceutical drug companies have a our society, the fact that this money is something that they, they count on. This is money that has been coming in and once you have a corporation that's used to acquiring wealth or we have a bottom line, this is what we make and why we're making less now, why would it be no, they're not going to step in and say, listen, I think we be better for society,

Speaker 3:          00:45:59       society so that we earn less money smoking crater. But that CEO is and someone else has to be is going to do that. Whether you talked about this in the show yesterday,

Speaker 4:          00:46:08       guess a gator roll oh data role. When you're a gator grabs a hold of its prey. They roll.

Speaker 3:          00:46:14       But yeah, I'm not going to a big clarity cause you gotta see this and I gotta tell you I was haunted by that when I drive. I like the idea of you spinning around. It's like, oh my God, there's not enough in the world. We see them alligator bite on to a, yeah, they spin, they were seeing and they try and rip it out of the joint down on the side or something. That's how the Ted is not helping my mental image to think of your mental image with an alligator next. That's this whole kind of people who don't know my job or like what the fuck are they talking about? But go see it because it's worth breaking it. But, but you had to scrape it when you're talking, talking

Speaker 1:          00:46:49       about like it's pharmaceutical companies. Well you know, try masturbating and with pot and stay awake. But I think that's something else too, which is that, you know, why is tobacco legal and part is not? Well, as it never discussed, it just kills 5,000 people in there. And because tobacco is a factory farm product part, you can grow at home, right? So if you enable people to self medicate, you know, and I don't mean that in a bad way, but to self medicated, right? Like you having trouble sleeping, I smoke a bit of part and you fall asleep, right? You can grow that shit at home, in your basement, in your backyard or whatever. There's no profit to anyone. So that stuff like the stuff you can grow tobacco, you can't grow tobacco in your backyard. Will you be affected for tobacco? You wouldn't have to have a license to do so. Right, right, right. It's not like you can grow

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       tomatoes, like you can grow your own tomatoes, but when you deal with anything that affects your consciousness, you have to have, uh, uh, you know, the government has to step in and allow you to do so, which is we can just make your own ooze. Oh, right, right. Your own moonshine. Isn't it elite? I mean, this has got to be some sort of regulations. It's like you can, you craft beer making, right? But how does that work? Do you have to?

Speaker 1:          00:47:52       Well I think as long as you don't sell it, I mean I think you can make your own stuff at home or whatever, but I think that tobacco, you need like a big, you know, certain only certain places and a big crop and stuff like that and process that you just really hyper as pot use grow, it's not. So I think it would be really tough, you know, cause we measure economic productivity this weird way, you know, like if someone gets sick that GDP goes up. Like how is that same? I mean surely it's sickness, it's a bad thing that you shouldn't reflect a negative result. But you know, they go spend a lot of money on treatments and suddenly he's like woo, we're richer. You know? And, and so same thing, if you then have people smoking pot but they ground themselves, your GDP is going to take a huge crater. And then all these people that are going to be out of work, who's supplying all this horrible stuff to people and so on. And I mean, the way we measure stuff now, I mean it's just completely as forces everyone into these really, really bad decisions.

Speaker 2:          00:48:38       Yeah. I wonder, one of the things he said that I really agree with about how boys are so much different than girls, uh, when it comes to learning. I just recently started volunteering at my daughter's school and she's in kindergarten and I watch boys. Do you volunteer like these? They have these tables set up and you have to, everyone has to put together this little book and cut these pieces out and put it in order and you watch boys do it as opposed to girls and they're sturdy. They're a different animal. I mean it's a completely different thing. They are almost like they're there. They're so challenged like the girls can just do, do, do, do, do it nicely and humming to themselves and attend. These aren't the hunting and the lines and that they're barely paying attention to what's going on. They want to run, they want to go do something.

Speaker 2:          00:49:23       And it's like, that's how I felt growing up. I always felt like, I can't wait for this fucking bell rang so I can run outta here. Yeah. And it, I thought at the time, well obviously I'm not very smart and I'm not going to be good at school and it wasn't that at all. But what it was was I am not designed for this. Like there is a society and this society has a broad spectrum of human beings and we have various tasks that we will do and we will be really good at and we'll have different occupations that we can choose and different one suit, different personalities, but this fucking cookie cutter shit that they do in school, they want everyone to be the same way because that's all they have money for. That's all we have resources for. We have, we have the ability to stick you in this class from 9:00 AM to whatever, 2:00 PM and do this stuff and then you know, we, we need you to listen and then you go and then you leave and we'll give you a grade on it. And it's madness. The idea of that as an educational backbone, that, that, that has an educational foundation for a human being. It's madness. No

Speaker 1:          00:50:22       nothing to give to their history. You know, there's, there's two things that are best, the best predictors of empathy, right? Empathy is what we really, really need as a species. Like we're fucked with that empathy because we've got these weapons of mass destruction, we got to do your weapons and we go like if we don't really work on empathy is the most important resource. So the question is how do you grow it? Two things seem to Kim come up on the top of the list for how to grow up empathy. Uh, I would never have guessed them, so I'm like, let's get a driver. And the two things that, that rice at the top, when it comes to developing empathy, number one, the presence of a father. Isn't that interesting? Because men are considered to be less empathetic and women are more empathetic. Presence of the father is the number one predictor of their further development of empathy.

Speaker 1:          00:51:00       Number two, it's free plate in nature, free play in edge. And my daughter's really into this right now. Like we have toads that live by our house, so we have a froggy pardon, I'm far away. And she's learning a lot about how to handle things, delicately had a play with them and all of that. She's great, great with the animals and frequently in nature and the presence of a father. Now what's happened over the past 40 years and as society, kids don't get free play in nature anymore. Most of it's scheduled shit in the gym, you know, with the dance classes and all that thrombus that was, but give them free play in nature of the glorious anarchy of childhood where it's just like he doesn't have to do and go do something. Right. That's number one. And number two, of course it's dads and vanished from so many households.

Speaker 1:          00:51:38       And this is why in the last 15 years sociopathy one of the most malignant forms of distractive personality traits, sociopath, he has doubled in the last 15 years. I'm not sure what that term means. What sociopathy, uh, people who, um, uh, grandiose zero conscience, they use other people there superficially charming but never keep their promises. So especially if they have no, they have no conscience at all. And then we'll know measurable conscience, like you can show that the most horrifying stuff where you and I is our brains would light up like Christmas trees. Right? And they just, they don't care. They don't have any particular, and this is doubled in our society, uh, to, to the point when Alec Between One and 25 and one in 20 people are sociopaths. I mean that's tens of direct correlation between that growing up with a father and not being, well, those are two significant risk factors.

Speaker 1:          00:52:25       There's other stuff, you know, physical abilities, how do they calculate and all that. So they just find sociopath and work backwards, back end what they do big, you know, the big studies, uh, and they asked people all of the questions and sociopath's filled reliant, you'd get stuff wrong because they just don't have empathy. They can fake it, you know, they kind of know that's what's expected, but they don't actually feel empathy for other people. And you can find that with a series of questions. You can also measure their brains and find out how they react to certain stimuli and how it's different for the rest of the population. And they do big studies on that. And then they extrapolate that to the population as a whole. We were talking about Fm Ris, uh, on the, before this recording started, he was gripping. Shit, we've got another crappy, we audio engineer and put it all together. But the fascinating thing about Fmis, being able to measure various aspects of the brain and reactions to certain things, um, on my television show and have you ever seen it? It's called Joe Rogan questions. Everything. Well, one of the things we did was watching. We've talked to, can you want a new word rather? It's beautiful thing. It's actually from that finding bigfoot show there. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:53:28       Yeah. Talking about it long before my show, but we, um, I spoke to a woman who is a, an, she was an expert on, uh, use of the EEG and Mri and she said that there was actually a court case where a woman was convicted because she had functional knowledge of a crime scene and it's based on Fsri wow. That she had functional knowledge of a murder scene and the woman who was a neurologist felt that it was very dangerous because she said there can be functional knowledge of something based on how much have they talked to you about this crime scene. Have you formulated imagery in your head? Have they shown you photographs of the scene? How do they like what places and how do we know what, what aspect of it relies on personal creativity or the imagination to sort of conceive him and played out in your head and then that this is registered on the FM awry. It's fascinating, fascinating stuff where we're getting to really understand the various components of what makes us a human being.

Speaker 1:          00:54:30       What memory is really tricky. Do you, do you have these things? I have these things, Joe, where like I had stories about my childhood and I swear to God, I could not tell you if they're true or not. I don't know if I heard that story. Somebody told it so many times now I don't know if I'm in France and there's a rep half of the planet or Deborah, I mean I'm not sure. Like I don't know. I did the stories like, oh, I remember when you did this and I mean, I don't know if it got extrapolated or it got nec. I don't honestly know like you know, pictures of it. It didn't happen. But I don't know. And I think that's true for a lot of people like you, you can tell you talk yourself in and how to stuff. They did a study recently that blew my mind about people's ethical integrity, right?

Speaker 1:          00:55:08       So they did a study where they got people to agree with a particular ethical statement. I agree with this ethical statement ever abortion is bad or whatever. They get ethical state and then they had them close the book and then they, the book stuck a new word that made it exactly the opposite statement. Right. And now agree with this thing that I formally condemned as the youth. Right. They opened it up and they ask them, can you just read that again and tell us what you think? About 70 to 80% of the people would read it again and completely agree with the exact opposite statement that they've made, not three minutes before. And had great reasons for it too. Wow. I mean, this is the level of fluid unreality that people live in and it's really dangerous and we all live in. Yeah. And we all have to fight this tendency for sure.

Speaker 4:          00:55:51       Well, I've had real issues with people when you talk to them about past events and they start giving it an incredibly distorted, self-serving version of it. And I wonder whether or not they really believe this or not. And then I'm, I'm really, um, I'm a big proponent of if I criticize something, I criticize myself first because I think that if I criticized the various aspect of human nature, like memory, my memory is fantastic and yet fucking terrible. You know, I can go like when I do the ultimate fighting championship, when I do the broadcast for the fights, I, you know, I can

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       run a law statistics. You are, um, you are great with names. Thank you. Yeah, no you are. Because for me people might as well just introduce themselves to me with like, Hello Andrew. Angela. Cause that's all I got. Three minutes. Same concept. But you just like Blah Blah remains just trip off of your time. And I think grab, well especially when it comes to like mixed martial arts or something that I'm passionate about, I can remember details of fights, very important things. But like last night, last night show was amazing. I've been looking forward to it for a longest time as a rod to be part of like that was a killer chef. Oh, it's real. A lot of fun. So it's 3000 people. I'm on stage for an hour and 20 minutes and if you had access to my memory of that night, it would be blurry snap shots.

Speaker 2:          00:57:07       Remember Hacivat oh yeah. Did I do that job? I don't remember if I did that. Joe. I have notes. I mean I have it in the moment. If you can remember it too well and you were watching yourself. You weren't in it. Yes, but it's, but it's a huge event for me. Important once a year thing where I come to Toronto and yet my memory of it is this incredibly cloudy thing and it's like that is the case. I think with most human beings when it comes to memory and we were looking at, we look at memory and we try to pretend as if my memory is locked solid, you know, it's, it's in there. I bolted in, it's screwed in place. Yeah, it's not going anywhere. And that's nonsense. The mind doesn't work that way. There's various things you can remember. I remember how to use this espresso machine and pushed a little carton in there.

Speaker 2:          00:57:54       I press that button and the junk comes out. But you know, the, the, the reality of my day, like what went on today, it's just snapshots, like weird flashbacks of food, Iaa, jokes that we tell them. It's very strange, the human mind. I think one of the emerging aspects of technology that I'm incredibly fascinated with is this symbiotic relationship that we're starting to have with, with computers, machines, Google glass. I think we're going to develop an artificial way of recording things or an artificial way of recording life that's going to be like, I'm going to be able to, you know, Stefan, please check out my day and drop off my day and you're going to roll with like, Holy Shit, why don't you fucking terrified in this as well. This is a crazy moment. Like what? We won't be able to call each other I man. Yeah. It'd be a little bit fast forward into this lives and, and share what you know that

Speaker 1:          00:58:46       a bunch of lawyers and trying to get in touch with the NSA these days because the NSA records everything. Right? And so they're saying, look, I mean for my court case, you guys know his cell phone was here, but he was talking on it and they say he was here, but then sell a company, doesn't have records. Go back two years. You, you guys can get this guy had a Jane doe and the freedom of information acts. They're just hammering these guys trying to get facts out to get people out of jail or put people in jail.

Speaker 2:          00:59:11       I think they don't want to really completely admit that they are recording everything. I mean, when Obama addressed that situation, it's easier to record everything. And then some things. What if we applied this on

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       and off when he said something important? We were just recording about a data. It's not a concern. We're not spying on Americans. Yeah, yeah. The fuck you're not man. They're spying on everyone and they're putting it all in these gigantic hard drugs and the APP. No, I mean hydride spaces so cheap now, but I've always lived like, it's all, it's being recorded ever since I went online. Smart. Oh, come on. It makes a smart way to do it. And it's showing now at this point in time, but that is if you send something, if you transmit something, someone can receive it. If someone can pick it up, someone can enter, intercept it. It's a, it's a very strange aspect, but again, as as we were talking about before, I think it, we are in an adolescent stage of this relationship that we have to technology in this relationship that we have to information.

Speaker 3:          01:00:06       I think ultimately it's going to get to a point where there is no boundary between your information or my information. And I think with that really gets weird is with money because money essentially, right now it's just ones and Zeros and when you get down to this, there's a finite point of this finite barrier and that barrier breaks and there is no, there's no boundary between anyone in information. Mine is just information. It can start getting really fucking weird. Yeah. Money is agreed bullshit. It is. It's like that's, both will give me this bullshit and real. Right. That's how churches get built. Yeah. But money is just this complete fiction as you pointed out. I mean, you know, it used to be used to be old. It used to be some stuff you had to dig out of the ground. You couldn't just make it up like that.

Speaker 3:          01:00:49       Right. But the main effect buying this, you mentioned $85 billion worth of treasuries. They didn't have that money. It's not like they went out and made it out. Man, that was a long shift at the weight at the pizza had to get those tips, man. They just, they type whatever they want into their bank account and we don't think that's going to corrupt human beings. I mean Kippy a breath. It's so strange. It's so strange. And W we, we live in the weirdest time when it comes to money as well because of the whole collapsing the banks and the bailouts and the president getting on television and saying he's going to limit the Ala, the guys who we bailed out and he's going to limit their fucking bonuses to half a million dollars. And we're like, what? Where's that money coming from? Is that all our money? You're going to take our money?

Speaker 3:          01:01:30       Who are you to give it to? These guys, it's a bonus for failing, like the banks failed. And so they get a boat. Like what are you saying? Like what is this madness we're living? Well, Obama of course, you know, there's some theories that the, one of the main reasons he got elected, he took, he took the most money at all the candidates from Wall Street, from the financial companies. And I mean, what's he gonna do? Throw them in jail? Like they just did this fine. I think it was yesterday, um, at JP Morgan got hit with a fine of $920 million. Right? And first of all, that's just bail out money. They're handing back, you know, the boob burning money here. You, oh, it's back. Right? But secondly, I mean, let's say that they did, they seem to have admitted to some legal stuff, right? So they did the legal stuff, which costs their clients a lot of money, or the client's getting the money back. No government gets it. It's like phoning the cops and say, somebody stole my car. The Cop said, we, we found it. Are we gonna keep it, but we found it. I mean, government, why would the government

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       get the money for what JP Morgan did to ripoff it's customers. Plus the JP Morgan employees aren't going to get racist because I mean, but the JP Morgan executives, they don't pay anything. It's a corporation. I mean they can't pay, I mean the corporation is just this abstract fiction that people make up that shield themselves from legal consequences. So everyone's like, oh well they got fine. So they, you know, somehow the JP Morgan executives are out that money and it's like, no they're not. I mean they're never going to get thrown in jail for anything.

Speaker 4:          01:02:44       Never, never going to get thrown in jail for things that the average person would be locked up for the rest of their life if they were involved in fraud at that level, if they were involved. I mean just think about, just think about what when people go to jail for just for what they do with the stock market for manipulation, the stock market. I mean that is essentially a, how much different is that really? Then what goes on with the banking crisis? I mean, you're talking about moving money around, you talking about manipulating things and figuring out a way to profit from these manipulations. Yeah. How is, how was insider trading any different from what these guys have done?

Speaker 1:          01:03:23       Well, it's not any, I mean, if you want to talk about manipulating the stock market, I mean the Federal Reserve buying the treasury bonds just because nobody else wants those pieces of shit frankly. Right? I mean, the Chinese are sick of them. The Indians, it's a sick of them. The Japanese are sick of them because they know that they can't possibly be redeemed without hyperinflation or some other defaults. Right. As either a software heart, he thought they know that that stuff is junk. So the Fed is buying them just to prop up the prices and they're doing that. So all the other governments don't have to admit that they're basically toilet paper's in Bob Wheaton, you know, Donald Mill toilet paper. Yeah. And it's all just this crazy thing that they can't possibly sustain. You know that this show, once they'd been about 240, like just paper, only coffee accounts, right?

Speaker 1:          01:04:03       Paper only money in a history of the world. 240 240 different ones, different, just different, you know, they, you know, some government gets in power, the issue, some bullshit currency and then it blows up and then they issue some new currency, whatever. And there's only one of them that's still in circulation from a couple of hundred years ago. It's the British pounds though. It's last like 97% of its value in the dollars last like 98% of it's value since the Fed came in in 1913. Uh, and um, and people say gas, it's expensive. It's not, if you guess it's cheaper now than it was in 1960. If you pay for it and silver, if you pay for it. And this paper a shit that the hand around pretending it's money, it's really expensive because it's been devalued so much. When I first came to Canada in 1977 I was like 11 years old.

Speaker 1:          01:04:44       I can get a candy bar for it now. You don't now and within like 10 years. So it was like a buck because they're just printing all this crazy money. Printing money is a great gig because you get to hand it out to all the people who are voting for you and then the inflation hits like two years later and nobody can connect the dots. It's beautiful. And plus everyone blames the local supermarket for raising the prices as if they want to write. But it's all the central printing money stuff is just really, really dangerous. And it brought down the Roman empire was exactly the same way. They just kept putting more and more crap into their money until what was Sylvan and areas which originally 100% silver. It ended up being like one and a half percent silver with basically like, you know, Zombie teeth, that Harish shit thrown into it. Right? And it just destroys the entire, the entire economy. And this is going to have to be this huge reset and the global economy. So what's, how is that?

Speaker 2:          01:05:29       I'm going to happen. I mean w w what's fascinating is that now that we have this incredible access to information and now that you know, people like you were putting this stuff out there and it's, it's become a part of the narrative. People understand what's wrong. It's not just a matter of it goes wrong and it takes years for people to put the pieces together and then you have to go to school and learn what's wrong. It's really right in front of your face. What's wrong? What happens now, do you think that there's an adjustment period? Do you think that because of this ink, this incredible groundswell of information, do you think that it can be re engineered? Can it be redesigned? Can it, can we, can we somehow or another bitcoin our way out of it?

Speaker 1:          01:06:10       Well, there's a long term solution which I think is multigenerational, which has to do with treating kids batterer right? Raising them rationally and not using aggression on them and all that. So there's a long term solution. I mean, the short term solution I think is just, you know, trying to invest in human capital and try and convert paper currency into something tangible like real estate or gold or something like that. I think those are sensible strategies that lots of people who've been on my show and all the economists will talk about. I think that's all good stuff. Um, I think what's going to happen in the short run is obviously the government's going to run out of money. I mean, no matter how much they print, they're just going to run out of money. And then what happens is there's going to be talk a sacrifice now, not the kind of sacrifice like forget the second car, stay home with your kids that we've been talking about before, but like real hard and sacrifice.

Speaker 1:          01:06:52       So they're gonna say, well, we spent the on remains for so long. You've seen this happened before in history. And they just basically turn on the dependent classes, they, of welfare recipients to live on less social security recipients who live on less and they're just start squeezing the dependent classes because that's the biggest single bail. And also you'll, you will see, which of course is the goal of a lot of overseas terrorists. You will see the u s begin to withdraw the imperial presence in the world. Right? They got over 700 military bases all over the world. That's an expensive stuff. Is that really the number now? Seven over 700 I think 720 now. That's incredible. Oh, it's crazy. When we talk about like the Roman Empire, when people talk about getting this con constantly in the world, like it was nothing. Okay, this guy was basically just a fuck machine.

Speaker 1:          01:07:33       You know, like I took a third of people in that section of the world can trace their lineage back to that guy. I mean he was working overtime and he like, he never did the gate of all. I think that by trying to say it was pretty amazing. When you think about how much damage they did though, you really will read or listen to Dan Carlin show hardcore history. Yeah, he's been on my show actually. Yeah, he's got a great show. Great Guy. He's his piece on the con, the wrath of the cons with five part piece. Um, the, the, the incredible accomplishments of Ganga scars.

Speaker 2:          01:08:01       Mongol hoards, no. Yeah, they're responsible for the death of at least 20 million, perhaps 70 million people like depending on the ass. How over the course of his lifetime and the lifetime the sons like

Speaker 1:          01:08:14       that's the bad shit man forces pad

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       stuff, horses, horses, arrows, the killed at least 20 million people. I mean that, I mean, once you're on hook in a while, like that's a lot of, you haven't tried pulling a boat. I mean those are real close to the of the compound. Yeah. Those clothes would acquire 160 pounds of pressure to pull. Yeah. I mean like at one point you just give him a fucking arm flies off, you know, that you don't even like, it doesn't even shoot an arrow anymore. You're just arm goes across like a boomerang. I don't know what you do at that point. And they had women that could pull those bolts and shoot from a horse like that. A Bullseye while you're awesome thundering along. I mean also shoots sideways, talked under the Horse. Oh, right, right. I couldn't get hit from arrows from the side. Right. There were like shielding themselves. I mean if that was still going on, would you take narrating that job? That's my costume come up with. That'd be pretty exciting stuff. It would. Right, right. It's a completely violation, but the non aggression principle, sorry Theo. The beautiful thing about the UFC is it's a mutually agreed upon competition. Absolutely. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:09:13       A character contest, a contest of will and planning and discipline and to me it's, you know, the ultimate fighting championship is to me literally the ultimate in competition for a human being. As far as like, I don't think it's for everybody, it's certainly not, but I think as far as like the amount of time and energy and focus and then the maintenance and the control of your emotions during a contest, because you're literally putting your health online and your consciousness, you can get incredibly badly hurt. I think it's one of the reasons why it's so incredibly exciting

Speaker 3:          01:09:50       and the discipline you, I can't remember the name of the final, but you're saying it's one guy who keeps a list of everything he wants to accomplish by his bed and like [inaudible] first thing that he gets up and I'm finding it just focuses on that stuff. Favor doesn't, same thing. Yeah. They both hate each other. Twin smelling. Let me, let me spin your theory because we're talking about the fighting stuff and I was, I was watching the show last night and I was, I was thinking about like why is this occurring? Like why people could be doing anything with their time and money that come in here to see some really funny stuff. I was thinking about a lot of the stuff that, that you and the other two comics talked about is pretty visceral, right? I mean you, you've, you've got this great phrase that you use.

Speaker 3:          01:10:29       Um, the monkey energy, you know, like you've got this crazy monkey energy when you can't pay your mortgage and you know, you've got to go out and do something physical because your body thinks there's like a tiger jumping at you and stuff like that. And I was really struck by, you know, Dick fart jokes and stuff like that. I mean, come jokes and stuff like that. They're funny. But I think it's really interesting the degree to which people respond to that because it's not polite conversation. You know this, I've never seen a sign outside the box office relative to yours. It says the most extreme possible language will be used. Like do not, if you, if you like Jane Austen, your head is gonna explode in here. Like it's just not

Speaker 2:          01:11:04       same sign since like the 1990s actually that sign I put up, it's on my first CD, which is called, I'm going to be dead Sunday, which released in 1999. And the, the, that sign was something that I started putting up in comedy clubs because I got tired of people complaining and I said it would contain, this show will contain the most extreme content. Imagine that.

Speaker 1:          01:11:24       Yeah. And it really did like I have a pretty good imagination. They might have less did and cam class. Well, no, that's good. I mean that was good. That was good. So I was thinking, okay, but why are people so drawn to this? Because it is a very common component of comedy and all that. And let me give you a tiny theory and then you can tell me that as an outside non comedian, I'm completely bullish yet, which is fine, but, but I just sort of idea like we supposed to be United in what to me is just a lot of crap. You know, like countries, patriotism, socialism, uh, our God, our saints are whatever our client are like, it's all nonsense. And it doesn't actually connect people because it's kind of fantastic. Right? I mean nobody, even countries, they don't even really exist. They really colors on a map.

Speaker 1:          01:12:09       They call them tax farms, but they don't really exist like a real thing. But where we can connect. And I think where this comedy show last night really did help people connect was we are all mammals, you know, and we have these bodily functions and we have these impulses and these urges and these fantasies. Like the first guy talking about his fantasy of yeah, it'll Gadol Brian Cowen. Yeah. Brilliant stuff. Brilliant stuff. And anything again. And I'm English enough to know that anything that marks the French gets up anyway. But, um, so I think that there's this like monkey meetup club that goes on in comedy clubs where we do connect to that really visceral level of, you know, of shitting, of fucking, of farting, of, of, of sex drives of, of, you know, the guy took it and got in the elevator, was talking to said that one of the funniest things to be that night with the noise you made when he was done, forgot to breathe when he's eating so much that you'd be here.

Speaker 1:          01:13:02       Right. But it's hilarious because we walk in there like, this food is so good. Why am I can't see out of my to do like that is that we want and these are also really common experiences that we really can't talk about because we live in these refined abstracts and countries and religions and clubs and all that, but here at this level we really do, I think connect in a very visceral way and there was so much talked about it in terms of connection and I think the audience is laughing because we never get to talk about how we connect and an animal level. Then I was thinking about the UFC as well, that a lot of your life I think is around getting people to connect at a very visceral animal level and animal level. Sounds bad. I don't mean it that way at all. I think it's really, this is where we do connect at the beginning. You know, we connect in sex, we connect and fighting, we connect finally primally and there. I think a lot of your work has to do with that and fear factor is also involved. That's really primal stuff. Primal fears that people have confronted them, overcoming them. People watching that. I think can really connect with that fear, with that desire for the money and the fear of the circumstances and all that. But the prime

Speaker 2:          01:14:01       fear of competition itself, the, the, the fear of failing, the fear of, uh, overcoming adversity or not being able to, that's, that's a, a real part of being person is the challenges of life itself. And with fear factor is a stupid show. You know, don't give me all, I don't have any grandiose ideas of what taglines for that. Right. How was the factor? It's a stupid show really show it was entertaining and I know people enjoyed it, but the, what is, what was fascinating to me, it was, I have a background in martial arts and in competition. More importantly, um, I, I thought most of my life from age 15 to age 22, it's basically all I did with my time. And so I understand what it's like to be confronted with a daunting task and understand what it's like to be standing there when the referee looks at you and goes, are you ready?

Speaker 2:          01:14:50       You know and then looks at the other guy and goes, are you ready? Go. You know, in that moment that like here it is, Whoa, like a cliff, right? I mean it's a very strange thing for us to just say, ready, go and then go do something. It's, it's really hard to do, to do it like to anticipate and also as human beings we can counter and all these different variables and one of the things about being an intelligent person and facing a difficult competition, whether it's fighting or anything incredibly hard, he's like, you were aware of the variables, you're aware of the failure, the wear of the humiliation, your well where have the embarrassment of failure you where we are. If the personal dissatisfaction with your own performance in depression that's going to come with that and all those variables they can combine to create like a constriction effect where you just almost can't perform you, you're, you're, you're overwhelmed by the possibilities and you would just freak the fuck out.

Speaker 2:          01:15:40       It's called being dwarfed by the moment the moment comes and it's one of the things that I was good at on fear factor is to talk people through that and just to let them know like, look, you can fucking do this. You just go out and you don't think about anything else but doing it. All those other things are attract. Those other things are demons. You got to keep those demons at bay. Don't, don't entertain them. Don't feed them. Don't give them water. Push them away. They don't exist. Well, you're going to concentrate on as repeating the mantra that you can do this and this is how you're going to do it. Be in the moment and go do this, and I helped a lot of people get through that show because of that and that that has a primal thing that's up. That's the difference between someone who survives an encounter with a Jaguar and someone who does it.

Speaker 2:          01:16:20       You know that someone who packs and freezes up and gets killed and someone who runs away, someone figures out how to climb a tree. Somebody figures out how to pick a rock and smash it into had the, the, the, the difference between someone who encounters an incredibly difficult situation and learns from it or dies because of it. That's a primal thing, man. I mean that is one of the reasons why we're here is because people did confront predators. And the reason why children are afraid at night of monsters is because we have genetic, they're monsters, jaguars and leopards eating us. I remember reading

Speaker 1:          01:16:54       a story about a guy who got bitten bike, right? Right. Shot and not like it bitten went off like it took his whole torso. It is math and it's math and it swam in the water with him and he was so dazed. He said he remembered it all very vividly and cause like he wasn't a head injury right here.

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       You forget stuff then. Right. But he was, he was under the water and he was just being basically pulled along into the deep water by the shark, which hadn't been this in his joints and he was just dates and he was like, I'm fucked. You know? Okay, well, what am I going to do here? Right. And then did the image of his kids came up and his wife and he's like, no fucking way. And he just reached up and he jammed his hand, the end of the eye of the sharp. Wow. And it shook him free. They'd let go because you know, I guess that hurts. I can imagine. Right. And he's slammed at the surface and he lived and he made it back to shore because there's that moment where you just go like, no fucking way. I'm not going out like this. And that I think is that thing. That's the primal, visceral response. Whereas before it was just like, I'm going to surrender to this God awful thing. And then it's just like, no, no way. No Way. I'm fighting back this.

Speaker 2:          01:17:56       Well, that's what's fascinating. Well, martial arts competition is that everyone has a sort of no way thing, but the reality of no way is if you're in the octagon with John Jones and you say, no way, it doesn't matter what you think.

Speaker 3:          01:18:09       He said, no way he's going to kill you. I won't keep it that I'm like a fine red mist of nothingness in about 10 seconds.

Speaker 2:          01:18:15       Some has been, they've prepared their entire life for this moment and it's not just the no way that you get when you're getting bit by a shark, but it's also knowing that that no way is coming every fucking day. Getting up at 5:00 AM when the alarm clock goes off and eating healthy and running and making sure you have the right amount of rest and take the right amount of vitamins and all that. Knowing that you have that instinct to say no way, but so does he, and that's not going to be good enough. Right, right. You're going to, you're going to have to control your body, control your mind, developed your skills and have an intelligent approach to this very difficult task in front of you

Speaker 3:          01:18:56       and you you've talked about, but when you were a kid that you saw violence in your home. Fortunately of course, incredibly sorry. Is it true that for a lot of these guys, they come from rough backgrounds and some aggressive or violent backgrounds? A lot of them, almost all of them. And what do you think the connection is there? Because in some ways you sort of think, well, if you saw that kind of stuff, wouldn't you want to get away from it? Well you would,

Speaker 2:          01:19:20       but sometimes you can't. And so you want to learn to protect yourself. And that's what a lot of it is. And a lot of it is, a lot of guys were bullied. I was bullied not too badly. I'm a, nobody really hurt me, but I was intimidated by a lot of guys, you know, like scared and it gets in your head, the bullying, it just circles around your house, humiliating. It's humiliating it, it can, you know, it causes people to jump off buildings. You know, it's, it's, it's a, it's a huge, huge problem with human beings, this natural inclination to pick on the weak, to satisfy our own, our own insecurities, you know? And um, uh, for me, I was, I was a small kid. I wasn't big. And there was just too many moments where I was scared and I was like, okay, this is not how I want to live my life. So I started taking martial arts. I was like, I got to learn how to fight cause this just too scary.

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       You don't want, environment doesn't get an end. You get exactly the fraternity like this is going to be the rest of my life and the environment is not going to change at the teachers aren't going to stop it. There's no way for my parents to stop it like if I don't act this is going to be the same fucking day for the rest of my life.

Speaker 2:          01:20:21       It was clear to me, it was clear to me that no one was going to help me and as a boy it was a, one of the core issues of being a boy growing up was dealing with the other boys

Speaker 3:          01:20:30       and this balance of power which was so against me. I was like, this is one of the things, a lot of the findings, you know that story of the kids in the jungle, they think it's like some island somewhere. When a plane goes down, I mean it's high school. I went to boarding school. I mean it's, it's not, it's not some island out there. It's like walking into the end of the school building. It's human nature,

Speaker 2:          01:20:49       nature. And there's the dance, like who's the Alpha? Like what's, what's going to go on here? Like who's going to be the one that controls the situation? Who's going to get the first pick of the girls? Who's going to get, you know, what, who, who gets to pick on people and get away with it. And that is a part of being a human beings. And it's also a part of being a human being. The, as you said, is developing in a society where children not being raised correctly. So you're, you're not, if a child grows up with martial arts as a, as a young boy, you'd be incredibly embarrassed to be a bullying because that is the worst thing you could ever be in a martial arts class. I am a black belt in Jujitsu and I roll on a regular basis roaming spar with people who are complete novices and I don't hurt them ever. I've never heard one and you know I just, I and I coached them along the way. I'm like you've got to, you've got attorneys that right

Speaker 3:          01:21:36       does it like they don't want to keep hitting my daughter cause were play wrestling. It's like for what have I been doing that for mean sometimes it's big strong men, they're on trend. But

Speaker 2:          01:21:46       the point is like if, if I like humiliated them or beat them up or something like that, it would be a massive embarrassment for my school. A massive verus would for me as a martial artist, like everyone in class would hate me because of it. There are people like that that do like bully and tried to hurt like lesser ranks or or novices. Those people are kicked out of class like they, they, there's no place for them. In martial arts, it's about developing character and then about representing that development and character, like having honor and having respect and if kids learn that at an early age there'd be no bullying in class, there would be none of that. There's always going to be people picking on people and people make making fun of people. But bullying is specific like ganging up on people and taking them. That's that.

Speaker 2:          01:22:34       That is one of the scariest aspects of growing up and it motivates a lot of martial artists to to learn and that's what motivated me. So ultimately it's like this terribly negative force channels itself into an incredibly positive thing that really became a developing factor for every aspect of my life and it became a, it became a real vehicle. One of the, I love music sprays a vehicle for developing human potential, so there's no, no, go ahead. When you find out, because it's so you find out what you can do and then other things become easier.

Speaker 3:          01:23:09       Yeah, I think the mastery of anything that's really challenging. I think great things for self esteem. Now when you started taking the martial lights, what happened with the bullying? I mean, did you end up beating people up or did you end up having the confidence that they then found a week or prey?

Speaker 2:          01:23:22       Very few physical altercations outside of competitions? You know, I have like one or two small ones in high school that were really no big deal. Um, the nothing like crazy, but the fights that I had in tournament's were so extreme, you know, like so many knockouts and just so, so much. Craig, the violence of physical competition is so much more intense than anything you'd ever experience in, in, uh, your average street fight. You know, like you're dealing with trained killers like you and another train killer dude. So like there was no motivation for me to prove to anybody that I knew how to fight. And then somewhere along the line other kids do like, oh, that's a, he's a black belt, he's this, he's that. And they just left me alone. So it became just become scary enough.

Speaker 3:          01:24:10       They leave you alone and then you don't, you know, you avoid the fight. Even voice is always better than cure. Right. And you have very little aggression because you're always training. So like when you train all the time, you're always tired. Like you know you have no, yeah. People Think, oh my God, he's so fit. I think of all the energy you'd have. It's like, oh my God, I just got to get from the Futon, but the cash, somebody give me a wheel better. It was a famous, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:24:31       Karate master who once said that the, the, the Tara Tika is, or not a nicer, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:24:37       just tired from training.

Speaker 2:          01:24:40       They avoid these things because they just, it's too hard to just get up for it. Right, right. But I think that human beings have a massive amount of, you know what I, I called Chimp Dna, that th the, the monkey instincts, there's a massive amount of those that are not being represented by the way we live our lives, the, the bodies that we have are essentially the same bodies is the humility, is that live to a hundred thousand years ago or 50,000 years ago? It was very little variation. Yeah. And the the, the need for physical movement and the need for just the activity and all these different, these different hormones and chemicals that your body just naturally produces. They have to be satisfied. They have to be, they have to be moved around. And I think it's a huge part of balancing your perspective in life, balancing your view of the world. It just to exercise these things out of your system and for boys especially. Huge, huge part of being sane.

Speaker 3:          01:25:38       Yeah. Certainly learning how to manage aggression is really important. I think one of the, yeah, I'm in a strong atheist and I think one of the things that was really harmful about religion was this idea that we are antibody, that we are souls trapped in this prison of the flesh and we're, you know him to be these rockets that rise up to meet the glory above and someone, because I think that gave us this feeling that the body is somehow, and it's very explicit in some forms of Christianity and other too that the body

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       is Satan's device to draw you away from God the lasts and then all that other stuff that the comedians make fun of it and celebrate. I think it's very probiotic, right? Cause it's funny and it's an enjoyable place to be. And I think that this hostility towards, it's called in philosophy, the mind body dichotomy that we have this glorious, my attracted this horrible fleshly chorus kind of thing. I think it's really, really unhealthy. And I didn't really get that when I was young. Like when, when I was 20 I went to the national theater school, I was going to be an actor and a playwright. And then some of that for a bit. But what they did there, which I thought was amazing, was real bodywork, which I'd never been exposed to before and grew up in England, you know, evens relationship to the body is, you know, and it's crazy, right when you can clean their teeth.

Speaker 1:          01:26:46       I love the taste of ginger fighters in the morning and I was like, empire. But, um, when I did this body work, which was like a, I don't feel the Alexandra technique, which is a binary repositioning technique that we did gymnastics, we did a sword fighting, we did play yellow stage fighting and all that kind of stuff, which is like in some ways more challenging. And uh, we did, um, the stretching and, and I got into yoga and stuff like that. And I always encouraging this in my shell because an idea with a pretty hyper intellectual audience, and I keep trying to remind people, you know, drive your brain back into the body, drive your brain back into the idea that as a seed of everything that you are, and you know, if that doesn't do well, you're not going to do well in the long run and don't split yourself off from the body.

Speaker 1:          01:27:25       But there's this weird thing in society where we are somehow not our bodies and it has to do with the sole idea. We can continue afterwards and I don't think I'm going to have any more reality after I'm death. And I did before I was born, which is to say not at all. And this is, this is where we are. And I really try to encourage people to really root themselves in that. You know, we have a second brain called the gap, which is almost as complex as the one we've got up here. And people say, I've got to get instinct. That's, that's real. That's not an imaginary thing. There's this great book by Malcolm Gladwell called Blink. You should pick it up if you haven't read or have. Yeah. Okay, so when he says, you know, people get stuff like so incredibly quickly and that's not a intellectual process.

Speaker 1:          01:28:01       That is a full body process and I think the people, you know in terms of you say, well how do we heal the world? I think our bodies detect in morality a lot quicker than our brains do. Like you don't have those people. They'd come around, you're like, man, there's something not right about this guy. I don't know if body language they look perfectly normal or whatever. If it's a slight vacancies in the eyes or something like that or was overly stiff body posture or something like that. I think that if we could see, you call them, I think exquisite noose bags they you're talking about now, but it takes down hopes the party in the desert. Then he could have these parties but there'd be a thousand cool guys and then one unbelievable Douche bag who would just ruin it for everyone. I think we can see those people, but I think we can mostly see them with the body and heart with the brain because the brain, we can talk herself in and out of stuff. But the Bonnie I think really connects at a very visceral level with the people that were around us. And I think if we could train people to be more in the body, I think they'd be better at detecting bullshit and better at detecting bad people and shunning them. And then we kind of isolate them in quarantine them not breed with them that having motor fucking upper kids. And I think then we'd be able to pass that gene out of the pool so to speak. Sorry, there's a hell of a lot rent.

Speaker 4:          01:29:05       No, absolutely on. And I think that the idea that the body is separate from the mind, it's really kind of silly. It's they, they, they, they, they work together and if the mind is working overtime and the body is falling apart though the mind's not to be at its optimum. Even if you have an incredibly advanced mine and beautiful knowledge and information, it would be better if your body isn't shaped. It'd be better if you were limber. It'd be better if you were weren't stressed out. Like we experience a physical stress of the deteriorating bodies. It's legitimate. It's 100% real. It's not just a um, uh, a vain thing. Do you want to keep your body in shape to look good? You know, it's an ego thing. It's not, it's, it's, you're, you are some weird symbiotic thing, you know, it's the mind and the body and then also the intestinal flora. It gets really freaky when you start realizing that you're actually an ecosystem.

Speaker 1:          01:29:59       Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was one thing. And the ecosystem is even within the mind as this great therapy called internal family systems therapy, which basically says that we are, we don't have like a single south, like we are competing ecosystem of, you know, our parents and those who want stuff from us in our, you know, some of our own needs, which is also to please those who wants that from us. And it's all it competing. And if you think that you've gotten like one ego, you end up being a kind of tyrant because all these other voices in your head telling you to do stuff or encouraged me to do stuff, kind of kept him down cause we need unity. But I think the idea that we are always in a state of negotiation with ourselves, uh, is really positive. And you know, I spent years in therapy and I think it's just fantastic to work for that kind of approach that we have.

Speaker 1:          01:30:41       I call it the Mikko system like me as an ecosystem. Uh, and, and it really is a lot of give and take and a lot of negotiation with yourself. And of course, if you can negotiate with yourself, I think you'll end up with a society where people negotiate with each other. I think that the people who are tyrannical with their own identity and that being tyrannical, but with others, I think that the way the world is out there, it's very much a mirror of the way we live internally. And if we can be more at peace and negotiating with ourselves and recognize that we should not have a single dominant authority within ourselves, but everything is a negotiation, you know, do I want to work out or I don't want to have an APP. I mean I have those negotiations with myself all the time and that way I can negotiate with my wife and my daughter and my she, my listeners and all that and I don't have a tyrannical part of myself that says, well you just got to do this.

Speaker 1:          01:31:23       God Damn it no matter what. Because I'm always afraid that if that's the way it is for me in there, in here, that's how it's going to translate to the world out there. I always feel that the, the, the, the most massive structures in the world and the government states, armies and all that, just a reflection of how we deal with ourselves internally. And I think try and get people to relax about how they deal with themselves internally and negotiating more than dictate. I think it's really important. I'm completely rambling, but I hope that makes some makes sense.

Speaker 4:          01:31:49       And the, the rigidity, being rigid and not being able to be flexible about things. There's also you just shoo the ability to alter your ideas about things and not feel like you're loser because you

Speaker 2:          01:31:59       changed your mind. You know, like the ability to admit mistakes and to be able to express where the mistake went wrong and what, what he believed. Now. I think that that's very important. I think one of the, the things that I see in people that I admire is one of the things I admire most is the ability to make, make wrong, the ability to make mistakes, the ability to admit, admit personal failures, and then the ability to grow from learning about that mistake. And one of the things that I find to be one of the most incredibly weak and I intolerable things is someone who cannot admit they're wrong. I can't communicate with people like that. I can't, I can't. Yeah, I've, I make mistakes all the time. If you don't, you know, maybe you're the perfect person, but if you do and you don't admit it, we can't talk.

Speaker 1:          01:32:44       Okay. We can't, well, isn't most of life not working out? I mean this is most of the most of life failure. I mean, that's one of my favorite writers is Charles Dickens or you take Shakespeare. Charles Dickens wrote like 35 novels of which like four or five or famous. So He's, well, he's the best novelist that we've ever produced as a species and he's got a success rate of 20% if it shakes me, we're one of 54 plays, hundreds of sonnets and of his plays, maybe 10 are regularly produce. No, the hamlets off dollars, motion events and all that. So he had a success rate of about 20 so the greatest conceivable genius is in human history, you have a success rate of about 20%

Speaker 2:          01:33:22       I've had some of my biggest breakthroughs from failures, from my disgust in the failure or my discontent and my recognizing where it went wrong and then my reenergizing and refocusing my standup comedy failures. I can literally point to the moments on stage, like the worst bombings and the history of my career, and then the giant leaps that I made and progress after that. It's always been the case. And I now to this day, if I have a set that's not so good, I recognize that I hate that. So I will now refocus and then this is a good thing because it's taught me well, you got a little sloppy there or you got overwhelmed by responsibilities or what, you didn't put enough focus in it, whatever it was. Now is the time to recognize that just like every other time in the past, you are now going to grow and you'll be better than you ever were before.

Speaker 1:          01:34:12       Yeah, I did. I didn't want to show and I thought I did the right research, but I didn't at all. I did a show on healthcare and then this woman who was a doctor, uh, who was pretty high up in the profession, she wrote me this long email detailing every single thing. But I kept running in my shell. And so what I did was I, you know, I am like, I just read this whole email believe sorry. I just, you know, I thought I knew what I was talking about. It turns out I had to had come so far in my ass and we see him back out of my own eyeballs. Good on you. Yeah. And it's a read the whole thing because if you're not correcting yourself, how you're going to have any credibility because nobody believes that your ride all the time. That's just impossible.

Speaker 2:          01:34:47       I correct myself all the time on the podcast because a lot of times during the podcast we're completely talking out of her ass. I remember something and then I'll be like, fuck. And now I go, hold on, let me Google. Like I'll, I'll constantly Google things when the middle I go, okay, I'm full of Shit because actually they proved it in 1972 that this is, you know, and I think that's really, really, really important, especially when you have this weird responsibility. Like as I know that you do, you have a massive following online and a lot of people very much respect your opinions, your thoughts on things and consider them very highly. So when you know, you, you say something or you go over something and then it turns out that it was incorrect or it was you, your original assumption was based on some bad information. It's so important to be flexible like that. So important to be honest like that and so that people recognize like you're a human being and everyone is listening as a human being and we're all essentially in the same boat together. One of us may have focused more on a particular topic or one of us may have had more talent in a particular area, but we're the same goddamn thing.

Speaker 3:          01:35:51       No, I think, I think it is important. And uh, yeah, especially when you put out a lot of chefs you can just going against that. You can't be an expert in everything. And that's the question that you have to read. And you also might want to model that behavior for people, right? I mean, because if you're the defensive guy who can't admit that he's wrong, I mean the kind of people who are going to end up being comfortable with you are not the kind of people you want to have around. Oh, this guy never admits he's wrong. He's an okay guy for me. Like you want to have that forcefield that repels the people who, who want that because that's not a good place.

Speaker 2:          01:36:19       I have a very critical forum and sometimes critical in a bad way. Like there's a lot of congee behavior and a lot of people just are really just negative people. Uh, but a lot of really intelligent people too that are really rely on it. And sometimes if I have a show that doesn't go well or if something happens or there's a dispute about something, Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. The criticism I think is hugely important, especially if it's honest and it's intelligent because that wasn't available before. And one of the resources of the internet that's so fantastic to me is that you can get opinions and you can get intelligent ideas from people that you would never be able to contact with a 10 2030 years ago. You just wouldn't be able to, and now you get them and you can interact with them in real time.

Speaker 2:          01:36:59       And it's a beautiful thing and it's so enriching and it's so important for your personal growth and for the growth of anything you're trying to do to have these intelligent people giving their point of view. You may or may not agree. And that's one of the things I find along the way. Like I'll have a read it and really intelligent review of why something that I did was not right. And I'm like, I see where you're coming from, but I disagree entirely. I can respect that, but I don't like that. I don't like this that you're saying is good. I don't like, I don't like smashing pumpkins. I don't like grateful dead. There's a lot of things, a lot of people like that I don't like. Actually I do like smashing pumpkins. Shouldn't say that both blue skies of the songs, it was due to, what does that one song?

Speaker 3:          01:37:39       I know the 79 I think. Is there any song that I know

Speaker 2:          01:37:42       was that world is a vampire. Do you know that one?

Speaker 3:          01:37:45       You are the person who is more of that kind of music, I think, than I am.

Speaker 2:          01:37:50       I love that song. So I shouldn't say

Speaker 3:          01:37:52       my temptation though. I gotta tell you my, my weakness is a Joe. You gotta stop me if I do this, I want to nit pick back, nit pick back. So I talked to a lot of libertarians and libertarians, God loved them. Greatest people in the world. But if you make one factual slip, like 6 million guys are going to come down with you and Ricky reed references coming down eyeballs. So at the end of the day, I was like, I said something about tigers in Africa, right? You know, and like 6 million people email me. Do you know God? How can you believe that there is high cause an affricate tigers are native to India. There's no tigers in Africa and Africa. Completely true except goal.

Speaker 5:          01:38:26       No, no. Yeah. As soon as I'm like, I bet you there's one taiga in Africa, so,

Speaker 3:          01:38:31       oh no, no, don't do that. When you're rolling the wrong, I guess in Africa, I'm with that.

Speaker 4:          01:38:35       Yeah. Well, you know, people love that sport of calling people out on the stakes. There's a certain like scorecard that you keep, you know, we can bust someone out. A why or by someone on a misquote or a mistake. It's a, that's a big part of the deep bumping movement. I had a guy on recently, a guy named Mick West, uh, who's, uh, who runs contrail science.org. Oh, the contrail snap. Yeah. And it's all about in his, his website is he runs metal bunk dot award, which is a message board. It's all about deep bunking conspiracies and ideas and incorrect. Awesome. One of the things that these guys love doing is debunking things for like a score they like for them it's like, you know, incorrect, this is what's right and this is, and they like calling people out on state, right. It, it gives them with, oh my God,

Speaker 3:          01:39:30       I'm sorry. That's the wrong number of grains of coffee for my coffee. I've explicitly tells you the right number. That's just off by three. So they're right with the right, you know, I don't think I should be happy, you know, and also the level of importance of stuff. See like I've had, I've done write speeches about really important stuff and make one little error and people are like, ah. It's like you have a big picture of people, you know, the sun has spots. It doesn't mean it's not like they're right. Right, right, right. Yeah. Oh, I just wanted to ask you a penis knowledge. Absolutely. And everybody felt that this was essential, uh, to add you, and I don't know if you ever figured this one out, but I watched the stuff you did. UNCIRCUMCISION [inaudible] cause we did a, it was Mike's idea actually. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:40:06       We did a video on, on circumcision as well, which started off with a video of someone getting circumcise the baby. And it's like, if you can watch that and still go ahead with it. I mean already checked yourself in against the meds, right? Yeah. You had a question about, because I think that the show got the opinion that women said that the sex was uncircumcised penis was better. And I think you were looking that up in the show. And I don't know if you ever got the answer, but we found, I think we've found the answer, uh, through various experimentation with it, with fruits and veggies. I'm kidding. Um, but what, what it is is because the, the, the four skin, uh, has, um, it, it makes less friction for the woman, right? Cause when you thrust the foreskin has some gift, right? Right. So it's, it's less friction for the woman. Uh, and because it's less friction is more, more comfortable because, you know, it's just kind of rubbing, rubbing, rubbing. Right. So, right.

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       So you trust and the four skin has a give back and forth. And so it doesn't stress the woman's vagina as much through that friction. That's apparently, which is why I think guys who was second inside and you need more lubricants and stuff like that. Uh, you know, like a good spray, probably be 40 before you go in or whatever. But I'm no expert. I just want to do, as I mentioned that and this, this, this, it prevents aids kind of stuff. What the fuck is that about? Yeah, I mean, well first of all, those studies are heavily suspect, then rely on self reporting and stuff like that. And secondly, it actually, let's say it does reduce, ate a certain amount, which has not actually been proven to do. It's actually kind of dangerous because then the guys think, well I have seven size, I don't need a condom.

Speaker 1:          01:41:33       But that even if you're circumcised, they still say, well for God's sake, wear a condom if you want to, if still. So it can actually be kind of dangerous and increase the spread of AIDS if people believe that study. So, so the 60% decrease in eating, fracturing people sort of sense like, well okay document. So 60% are you still gonna roll those dice? You know, I don't need a condom because you know, how do you, how do you justify those numbers are, I wouldn't love to see how they figured that out. It's that guy and you have a lot of sex with a guy with aids, you know, and then you know you circumcise him and a well now he's even less 80 like you. How are you doing it? Not known for an excess of soap, right? I mean this is really rough down there.

Speaker 1:          01:42:14       Right? So there's that problem. The penile cancer thing, I mean even the American Society of Pediatrics because they say, you know, you put P and l and cancer together, you usually we'll get a man's attention. As you know, these were like, Hey, I wasn't listening before. I pricked up my ears a penile. When you added cancer to it, I really, really began to listen. But the, the, the numbers that go down are so infinitesimally small and the chances of getting in are so teeny tiny. I mean it's like saying well but remove the baby's breasts because she might get breast cancer. Like this support is about then the support for circumcision, the unit, almost universal support though we find it's in America or Europe, it's hard to find any non Muslim kids who are circumcised. What does it in America, I mean it's a barbaric mutilation of a baby's genitals as far as I'm concerned.

Speaker 1:          01:42:58       Yeah. I think it's some ancient Paul Scheer removing half the skin of the penis. I mean it's not just the tip. I mean, sorry, let's put it that bluntly. And you have to put put shit into wedge it because the, the, the baby's born with the forced again in here, physically adhere it to the penis. You got to go and anyway, we don't have to handle everything on page details of deaths or mutilations, which are numerous. But the idea that it's still exists is troubling to me. I don't, it doesn't, there's no rational, it's not rational sense to it. There's, there's things that I get, I see if cause and effect and I see, I see why people do it. I don't see that one. I don't understand it. The only thing that I see is perhaps a justification of the old ways and the fact that it's been done for so long.

Speaker 1:          01:43:40       It's been a style. And people say, I want the sun to look like the dad. And I mean, how often a your son and your husband comparing penises, is that a big family hobby? I mean, we've been at our dinner saying, well you know, as longer and bigger. So I think, I think a lot of it has to do with, you know, why does trauma repeat, why does trauma, it's a big question. Why does trauma repeat? And I think Ponti white trauma repeats as it gets normalized, right? I mean, so you obviously made the great decision after seeing, you already had to do normalize what your dad did cause it hitting your mom. I mean you, you said like this is not how men are, this is not how I'm going to be. Right. So you, you normalize it. But if you totally worshiped him and he thought he was the best kind of ever, and this is what men do, you would be most likely to be enacted. Well, actually, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:44:21       Did until I saw that it was one of the most did when I saw my dad hit my mom when I was about five. It was the first time I'd ever seen him striker. And I never forgot the fee. I mean it's really difficult to remember exactly what I remember, but I do remember very, very clear feeling now. Very feel clear feeling was, oh he's fucked up too. Like oh I thought that my dad was my hero. And I remember being massively disappointed. I'll never forget that feeling of disappointment. Like this is not what I thought. I thought my dad was awesome. Perfect guy. And he's not at all, you know, he's a bad person. Right. And this is a bad scene.

Speaker 1:          01:45:04       No mine. But why do you think you had that response? Because some kids wouldn't, some kids would be like, oh I can't wait to grow up and hit my own woman. Right. I mean why do you think you had that response?

Speaker 2:          01:45:12       Cause I, cause I love my mom. You know, my mom was not a bad person. She was not an angry person. And when she got all that cause it, she was, she was a strong woman. She is still at, but she realized at that moment like this is not happening. And she packed up our stuff and we were gone. But I'll never forget the feeling of disappointment. They're like, oh, you know, like when you're a child, you hope that your father is a hero. And to know that he's not. So I think for me it was this, this very young introduction to close violence, violence within the household was, um, uh, sort of a defining factor why I was terrified of violence, why I wanted to learn to defend myself, like really early on. Like the idea that someone could just do that to you or that someone could do that to my wife or someone can do that to my mother. Right?

Speaker 1:          01:46:04       Yeah, it is. Um, I think that kind of recoiling from it. So you do normalize it. It was a bad thing. I do. Do you as a dad? I mean, I know me as a dad, I mean, I'm the idea that I would ever see that and look at my daughter's face or the fall from grace. Doesn't that terrify you? Terrifies me. I mean, I'm not like, you know, constantly trying to be like some statute of perfect fatherhood or whatever, but the idea that I would disappoint my daughter, uh, in that fundamental way where she have that crossroads with me and no longer look at me in that same, you know, look up to kind of way. I really think about that like every day. I would never want to see that. I think

Speaker 2:          01:46:38       the love that people have for their children often motivates them to be better person, be a better person. I know it does for me, you know, I, I couldn't imagine, you know, I mean, if I even raise my voice to my daughter, it's like,

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       come on, seriously, you can't do that. We can't hit each other camp. Throw things through a window. You can't, you know, the idea of hitting my daughter is insane. It's alien. It's impossible. And the idea of hitting my wife is so completely out of the idea of what's possible. It's, I wonder what my feelings would be if I didn't grow up in a house with violence. I wonder if I wouldn't be so repulsive to me having actually physically experienced it in person up close. But I did, you know, so I was, I was inexorably the, that that's, that's a part of my psyche, you know, that's that, that, that being a negative thing, that being a horrific crime. And there's also just a weakness. I can never forgive a man that's willing to do that. To hit a woman like that, it's just so weak. It's so incredibly, we just, it's such a, such a failure of character and such a, a negative, selfish impulse to hit someone like that. It's, uh, you know, it's, it's one of the major things it's wrong in, in, in human interaction is the ability to hurt each other too. To want and leave, to just reach out and injure each other. And then he didn't express our ignorance and such a, uh, a violent and selfish way.

Speaker 1:          01:48:14       Yeah. And I, I feel that, I'm sure you do too, but I feel that even more strongly with parents to kids who is so much bigger, you know, that your wife can, my wife can leave me your wife and leave you anytime. If you're a jerk, right? Your kids can't think of no way to go. They got, they can't just say, well that's it. You know, I'm, I'm, I'm getting a divorce from you dad and I'm going to go find a better dad. Or they have no where to go. They have no choice. There are so tiny. And I think mine, it's always makes you smaller than you're a victim. You know, and I, I kept kind of ne four year old, I mean you really so far out of options as an adult with all the choice in the world that you actually have to end up hitting someone. So tiny dependent, I mean that makes you

Speaker 4:          01:48:48       smaller than that was really some account of a guy who was losing custody of his child and um, the, the him and the wife had gotten divorced and I was reading this articulate, well written account of the horrors of the legal system until I came upon this thing where he said that his daughter went back, the daughter was three, went back to the wife and told of a mild spanking that he gave her. And I'm like, Oh, you're a douche bag. You're aligned. Douche bag or a piece of shit. You spank your baby. And what you're doing here is manipulating reality with your blog to try to paint yourself out to be a victim. You're fucking kid, man. I don't care if it's a mild spanking, you know, mildly spank a fucking three year old when you're a grown man. It's nonsense. It's crazy. You don't have to do that. They throw a temper Tantrum, hover over them, communicate with them until it's over and then give them a hug no matter what. And this is when I know it gets frustrating. It's been fresh. I've had frustrations and what, that's the number one thing that I always do when I, with my kids,

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       I always tell them, when I was your age, I was even worse at that when I was your age. I just to lie all the time. When I was your age, I used to do this all the time. I always wanted to be first. I always was selfish. I wanted to have all the toys. But then I realized that when you share it toys, it makes it better. It's hard to realize that as a four year rule, but one day you're going to figure it out and that's why I'm telling it to you and, but I have, you know, I have a lot of time. I have a, I'm a relaxed person. I'm not constantly under the pressure to perform in life and like to, to, you know, to do better. I'm in a good financial position. I'm in a good relationship position. When I see people that are stressed out by life and then life is overwhelming in the legs and it's like, it's almost like they're, they're overwhelmed by their plate and it's terrible. I'm a child.

Speaker 1:          01:50:38       Yeah. I always want to my daughter to remember that I was a kid too. And that's what you're talking about. I don't want her to think that I'm some giant authority figure that is in her life. In fact, I told her so much about my child did, she likes to play with me as a kid. He goes, okay, I want to play with little staff. And then she wants me to come into the room as little staff and play that way. And I think that's great cause I wanted you to remember that. And I think the God, if we could just fix language, you know, if you can fix language, I think we'd fix so much in the world. There's an old confusion saying, it says at the beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper names. I hate the word bank. Just say, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:51:12       You know, just say, Hey, I hit my head a mild spank and come on. I mean, don't call it war colon murder. That's what it is. Spanking. Yeah. Don't call it a rest. Call it kidnapping. Don't call it taxation. Call it theft. I mean, just use the proper words for things. And we'd solve so many problems. Euphemisms are, you know, they just, the plaque in the arteries of the brain that confused so many people. You hit your child. It's not as banking, we say while it's mild, it's just a little swat on the button. Oh No, no, no. If you're spanking, it's to deter behavior is to change behavior, which means the child has to hate and fear it. And I wish people would just be honest about it, but they can't even be honest with themselves. And then they get mad at the kids. For me,

Speaker 2:          01:51:46       I agree that the categorization and this, this, this thing that we do where we make one thing better than another thing, even though it's exactly the same, like spanking is better than, you know, but they're the same goddamn thing. You know? Like how about this? I mean it's sort of unrelated, but not really this thing that's going on with with this, the pouring of chemical weapons that somehow another murdering people with chemicals in that fashion is way worse than using drones. These robots that shoot Hellfire missiles into buildings and killed 98% innocent, 90% women and children.

Speaker 1:          01:52:25       There's that. Is that the actual statistic is that 80% Jesus

Speaker 2:          01:52:29       there, they're so bad at killing only the targets. Like the idea that these are pinpoint precise. It's fucking terrifying shit. But yet Obama will be on TV talking about how these chemical weapons, we have to deplore the of a father holy, his children begging for them to get up when the mother fucking kids, you blew up from the sky. What about rockets launched from robots like some Orwellian nightmare flying around cities with night vision where someone's got a remote controller in Nevada and they're pressing the fire button and launching these missiles. The, the, the, the, you know, this, this idea that we need to take military action. We need to kill because people have killed, you know, we need to go murder innocence because innocence have been very good.

Speaker 1:          01:53:17       Can I Syrian? So to solve that, we're going to kill some more Syrians, Syrians not to kill the, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:53:22       And we're going to do it with pinpoints strikes when meanwhile they know for a fact they're going to move innocence and civilians into those areas that are high risk military targets. They're gonna move prisoners into those, those areas. They're going to up the body count. You're going to do it on purpose.

Speaker 1:          01:53:36       And do you know, I mean, the terrifying thing about it's not just the American weapons, it's modern weapons in general is the fact that they will fuck with entire populations. Genetics. Like this is something I just, I just did this, um, study up this sort of review the Syrian staff, Americans outrage and chemical weapons and neat without even getting into Vietnam where millions of people were destroyed by these unbelievably horrendous weapons. The only thing America didn't use was mustard gas and nuclear weapons. Everything else. They just through from Amr stand on this population in Fallujah in 2007 they use this white phosphorous, which is basically just exploding the Lou that melts human beings and they just, it's fired indiscriminately into the city and they use these depleted uranium shells because they're good at piercing armor of which there really wasn't much of interact anyway. But this stuff has a half life longer than the planet itself and it's so screws with the genetics of the population because it goes into the desk that goes into the lungs have been a 600% increase in leukemia and in the years after this Volusia attack run by America binding by the special forces by the army, 50% of the children were born with birth defects.

Speaker 1:          01:54:42       And, uh, again, a geneticists who's kind of studied the city says that he's never seen a more compromised. It's a nice way of putting it basically more fucked up genetic population. This is going to go on for generations. These genes have been completely destroyed by these weapons. And then they're saying, well, you know this guy in Syria as see he use these chemical weapons. Then someone is like, but at least that stuff is not going to completely rewrite the genetic code of the population for generations to come. Or they deny the use of depleted uranium even though there's a lot of evidence that shows that they used it in Serbia too. I had to apologize to people because I was talking about where they used all these depleted uranium and all these guys from Serbia. Right, and say what? We don't count. I mean come on and we will with, they used it with us too with the same effects

Speaker 2:          01:55:24       and then that's also the cross of this, this, this Gulf War syndrome that all these people have come back was horrible illnesses that mirror radiation sickness and then the government has denied them medical treatment, so there's nothing wrong here. There's something going on here. It says

Speaker 1:          01:55:39       sad, sad statement that that's how we are today. Most of the people that I

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       need a really nice, they just find that to be a lot more people than I do. They say the average famous person meets like 10,000 people a year or some crazy number. Right. And, but don't you find that most of the people that you, this is the weird thing. The world is insane and so full of like the most soul destroying evil. Like yet most of the people that I meet are unbelievably nice. It's a weird, I mean like who are these reptiles who run everything? Cause I meet these really nice people and there's all the horrible stuff in the news. Well in all fairness, you live here. Yes, that's true in Toronto. That's true. I don't live a beautiful place. Yeah, it's a lovely place and people are pretty nice and trying to actualize

Speaker 2:          01:56:22       overall I say 20% less

Speaker 3:          01:56:24       douchebags in Canada than America. Well you got the BMW factor, which we ran into a couple of times on the drive down the BMW factory. You know that old joke about BMW? What's the difference? I'm going to tell a joke to go to a fucking line and a BMW, the BMW and the porcupine and the brakes are on the outside. So other than the BMW factor, very, very nice people and they must bring them in from Casa bar or something.

Speaker 2:          01:56:46       That's also always going to be the case when people are privileged or when they have more money or when they feel like they've worked harder and the other people are weak and lazy. You get the fuck out of my way. I've got the Mercedes.

Speaker 3:          01:56:58       People love to think that the accidents of birth, their personal virtues, I mean then it's all, you know, it gets a lot of, you know, a lot of people who make it big, you know, like put in a Poncho. Isn't there a godfather like Steven Spielberg or something like that. And she's a talented actress, a lovely lady, but she got a bit of a leg up in the business. Right? But a lot of people like, oh, you know, I happen to be born to this great family. I happened to be born in the west. When you and I am born in Kenya. I mean, what the hell are we going to do with time? The rubber tires to our feet to run around. And I mean it's so much of the good stuff in our life is kind of accidental 100% and you always take that for personal virtue is a, is a really great failing cause it really kills your empathy.

Speaker 3:          01:57:36       The flip side, it's also a, an incredible weakness that people have when they point to successful people going, oh they go look, you know? Yeah, it's good enough. If I got a funny every 10 years you end up in a lot of lack, right. Bust her ass and then you get lock all the time. It's weird cause I, you know, in your life, of course you find here's a standup before you got anywhere near TV or anything. I got right. In that sense I got super lucky cause that's really rare. It's really rare to get on a hit sitcom when you're five years in a stand up. Well yes. But I bet you when you got that Sitcom, you work pretty hard and rough. I got to coaching from the people who were more experienced on the sat and you really, really think about it as fast as we want you to fail.

Speaker 2:          01:58:17       No, it's not hard. It's not an, it's not a difficult process. Color of all the things that have ever done in my life. Acting is without a doubt. The easiest is that because it's like other people's words and you, you just have to be credible and hit your mark and it's certainly, that's a part of it, but it's also, it's just not that difficult to just pretend. I mean, we all know what happens when someone gets upset about something would all know what happens when someone's confused. We can pretend and it's your, it's also when you're, you're acting, you're, it's, you're, you have chance to do it over again. If you fuck it up, it's not hard. It's coming from martial arts and then coming from standup comedy, those two things. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:58:56       but you don't get to walk back and say, I do that joke again. Maybe once, you know, but after that, people are like, well, he's not, he's just screwing up, man. I got to wake up from being knocked out and we're going to fight again. Ice On my head. Mulligan we do.

Speaker 2:          01:59:09       Right then. Not only that, it's, it's one of those things that when you see someone on a camera, you see them on a screen, see them and this weird Alpha Male, those primate thing that we have where we think that the person who gets to talk especial the person that's on camera special because like that would be like the leader of the tribe or something. There's this weird, it's the sort of hijacked our human reward system with, with media. And so because of that, when you see someone who's on film and someone's crying, you give them incredible accolades. You are amazing. That film to change my life, it was amazing. All it is, pretend they pretending to be a murderer there.

Speaker 3:          01:59:50       I do what it does it for 12 hours a day. So not hard. Anything a four year old can do. And I think Marlon Brando who said that, you know, anything that four year olds, Shirley temple, he was talking about, you know, anything full year old can do, I'm not sure we should get big prizes for watch Ricky Schroder and the champ, it was like six years old and he's fucking incredible. The job like mine to sixth sense, Dylan, hey on this, I remember that kid just gives you goosebumps to see. It's not hard to

Speaker 2:          02:00:11       do and it's not something that requires like, like learning to play the piano or learning to speak French requires a lot of brain surgery or stuff, which is really significant. You know, standup comedies infinitely harder than acting. And then granted I was acting in a very limited way. I was doing a sitcom, which is one of the more limited forms of acting, but we also created a lot of the dialogue and effect. Dave Foley, um, was probably responsible for maybe 50% of everything that got made on that show. Is that right? He was like a secret producer because he was such a brilliant guy and so good at ad libbing that when he would do is we would, we had an amazing executive producer, Paul Sams, brilliant, brilliant guy, and created the show, the head writer and executive producer and a great writing staff as well. But Paul was really open to us experiment.

Speaker 2:          02:00:59       And so he would, they would give us a framework, they'd give us a script, but Dave would rewrite entire scenes. And so, so much of what we do on that show was ad libbed almost maybe 50%. Right. So it wasn't just about reading people's lines being easier. It's just an easier gig. It's, it's easy. It's like, so my, um, my stumbling into a sitcom, it was because of a bunch of lucky factors wouldn't lock number one that they saw me on MTV and they saw I got this on my, my comedy special or be half hour comedy hour when I was on a television show where I did like 10 minutes. They saw that and it went well. And then I got these opportunities. So just opened up from that. And then this show came about and then I got on it and it was a show that was already created. So it was all luck. That was all luck. And the idea that you get that successful after five years of doing standup is really, really rare. So I can't take any credit for that. But then from there,

Speaker 1:          02:01:58       yeah, for the area and even that, I mean to, to do the half at MTV special ed, but it was a hell of a lot of work and that comes out of the years on the road and no one had to work in the audience and the timing and what works and what doesn't and all that. So

Speaker 2:          02:02:08       that's all work. Anybody who is good at standup, that shit does not come here. No. No one who gets up there and can, can kill an audience of strangers. That's all work. You just can't do it from the beginning. Yeah. Anybody who gets that, you know, lots of agro tries just, just go give it a shot. I wouldn't, you know, they do it once. Maybe you will have a couple of good lines that you've accumulated or do you have, uh, developed over the course of your life? Some observations that you think are really fun and you wrote them down. They might be valid, they might be good. And then my work a couple of times, but not when people are paying, you know, people pay 30 bucks for a ticket,

Speaker 1:          02:02:43       you know, one after another. I mean I was just amazed because the hour and 20 that you were on stage last night I flew by for me, you know, at a match. Are you saying it the coach, do you remember? It kind of flew by to you. But I'm thinking the amount of work, I mean the amount of material that's written and discarded and tested and discarded, the amount of concentrated work that does an hour and 20 of making people laugh. But that's it. I mean men typically I spoke last night, huge amount of work entity

Speaker 2:          02:03:06       when I'm not working on other things. If I'm not doing the UFC or if I'm not working on my podcast, I am always thinking of stuff like, is this funny as it's interesting, but it's also, I've, I've kind of designed my life in that. The creation of material outside of the actual sitting down in front of the computer and writing, which is critical. You have to, it has to be done. That's one of the things that a lot of lazy comedians don't do post its and stuff like that. You can't just do that. You have to do both. You have to do the writing down notes and stuff is important too. But the actual sitting down and crafting the bits and putting them in order and figuring out a way you free ball when you're on stage and let it come when it's on stage. Because when you're on stage you never know what the hell can happen but this you have to be in the moment. Like when the guy came up to me at the beginning of the show and handed me the hockey puck or what the fuck are you doing? And then it became like five minutes of me goofing on this guy. But it was, I had to do it. It was this is, this is the thing that happened.

Speaker 1:          02:04:02       You know this is, but it's also, it's stitching everything together. It's the bridges between the stories that I was watching for last night. How do you get from one bit to another, and I hate the word bit cause it just sounds like such an insignificant thing, but that's what we call them. Yeah. So getting logically from one, one bit to another. Is it real? How do you audit them? How'd you feel?

Speaker 2:          02:04:20       Do that. Because if you don't, people don't want to follow your train of thought. The when you're doing, when you're doing your standard performance is not just telling you a bunch of jokes, but you're borrowing someone's consciousness, you borrowing someone's mind and the only way it really works as if someone trusts you enough, your thoughts are as the there. They're there as as they can be. They're unique. They're, they're surprising. They're stimulating to the point where someone saying, okay, take me on this rod through your mind. Take me on this ride. Because if you're talking like I've seen a million comedians and there's so many that I've seen that they start talking and I go, okay, get the fuck out again. I can't listen to this guys mind because what he's doing is he's got like a one stop. Like his premises are short. They're, they're obvious,

Speaker 1:          02:05:01       they don't mail is nicely, which is a challenge.

Speaker 2:          02:05:03       And there's, there's no depth to, the thought is there's no unique point of view. There's nothing there. They haven't done the work or they're not capable of doing the work. What did we, whichever one it is, I gotta get Outta here cause I can't give them my mind. You know?

Speaker 1:          02:05:15       Now do you want us, cause you know, you talk about, you know, being a positive force in people's lives and bringing happiness and you suddenly get that last night. Do you want to lead the witness? Right? Do you want people to come out of your show better? Why Sir? No. How do you want them to come out of the shell? Like it's not just having to calorie entertainment, that's all I would argue that you actually do put some, you do puts, I mean you're selling, you're intelligent enough to put some real wisdom, I think into what you do. And I think that people can come out of your shelves with some interesting connections that they hadn't thought of before. I'm not saying you're an educator, obviously, but I think that there's stuff that can, it's not just a burger, you know, it's not empty calories. Right. Cause there's a lot of thought in what you do.

Speaker 2:          02:05:58       Well, um, last night's said was particularly, uh, rich and ideas because some of the new things that I've been working on are, um, there's a lot of stuff that I'm working on about the sort of a weirdness of progressive thought later, like this, a really aggressive progressiveness that's going on where people are denying reality and they're doing it. So because they feel like people have been marginalized in the past, which is true, but it doesn't mean you spring it back the other way and say a bunch of stupid shit. It doesn't make any sense.

Speaker 1:          02:06:29       Oh, you judge people too harshly for judging people harshly. It's like, yeah, how does that work? Getting people for hit it. Exactly. Right. Exactly.

Speaker 2:          02:06:35       And some of the most aggressive people I know are liberals, so it's really strange. I mean there's an amazing video of, of University of Toronto, of this guy who was speaking about men's rights wiring foul is it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. These feminists are protesting these students screaming in their face. The students that want to go see this man talk about women's Oh, about men's rights and about that you hate women and all this, and they're incredibly aggressive. Younger hate I see is in the protesters. The only not good with, and by the way, incredibly ignorant to what this guy, his actual words are, and they weren't even aware. They didn't even bother doing the research. They didn't even bother formulating a true opinion on these this guy's ideas. They just decided that this guy hates women and that's a weird thing. Like I've had made some posts about feminism on online before and one of the things that I've found it incredibly strange is that I got called an Mra asshole and so I go, what does it, what does that mean?

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       What's the Mra? So that I had the events that be fighting. I didn't know what it meant at all. It's men's rights advocate or an activist and I was like, wait a minute. A feminist, a person who wants equal rights for women is saying that being a man who wants equal rights for men is an idiot. Or I could call the Dodo and Mra Dodo and I'm like, oh Jesus Christ. Like love as a compressed Socratic argument. I could call an MRA asshole worried toto and I didn't even know what an MRI, I mean I'm not a men's rights advocate by any stretch of imagination. I don't visit any blogs, I don't visit any forums, but I'm a believer in equality as far as like the laws and regulations as they apply to human beings and I do not believe that the laws and regulations as they apply to human beings in this country aren't even for men as the and women.

Speaker 2:          02:08:32       I don't think they're even for women and I don't think they're even for men. I think the three fourths laws are fucking horrendous for men and some of them are atrocious. Some of them are Canada or God awful. Dave Foley for the longest time. I don't know if he's resolved a horrible, anybody who's listening to this, just Google Day Foley, Joe Experience divorce. And there's a, there's a youtube video that someone compiled of just him talking about his divorce. It will make your head spin. And, and I know that because TV, because what? He lost $10 million in his last divorce. Yeah, yeah, yeah. As he said, it's not alimony. It's all your money. I mean, that's a, it is. It is. It's insane. It's insane. And that's not fair. It's not fair. I don't care what anybody says. I think that absolutely. If a man and woman get divorced, the match pay child support.

Speaker 2:          02:09:20       Absolutely. And if the woman was not working during the time of the marriage, I think there should be some sort of compensation, something fair. It's something reasonably, that's some of the assets that he developed by focusing on whatever. Yeah, sure. Absolutely. But there's a terrible payments. That's just not right. It's not. It's not right. And I have a friend who has to pay his ex wife. Um, they were, they were married for 12 years. He has to pay her for the rest of her life until she gets married. So she plays this game. She has a boyfriend and the boyfriend that was of her and he sends a, the investigators over to figure it out and the boyfriend's not there and then he leaves and the investigators leave in, the boyfriend moves back in and so he has to continue paying it like, like she's cohabitating with a man and he still has to continue to send her money.

Speaker 2:          02:10:02       And it's just a manipulation of the legal system. And this guy has paper millions and millions and millions of dollars. She's in his $4 million Pacific Palisades home. I mean it crippled him financially. And on top of that he had a pay for her lawyer, whether they want to, it's gone through divorce and here's where it gets really crazy. She went to every lawyer in town and consulted with them, every good lawyer in town that she knew of so that he could never use them as counsel. Oh. Because there'd be conflict of interest. This is madness. I mean, she planned out, she planned this divorce out for a long time, was incredibly calculating. And the idea that men don't deserve rights and because of the fact that women have been marginalized, which is true, they have been. But that doesn't mean that men haven't been either. I mean, human beings deserve to be treated fairly.

Speaker 2:          02:10:50       That's, that's true to you. You deserve, everyone deserves to be treated humanely. I don't believe men are, I don't believe women are, I don't believe humans are. But the idea that you could separate and be a feminist, but be anti men's rights, well, you're a fucking crazy person then. You know, you're not a humanist. You're not a person who's looking at all human beings as your brothers and sisters. You're a person with that agenda. You're a, a person with an ideology. And that ideology is that you're on a team, you're on team vagina and everything that's on the penis can go fuck itself. And that was the, that was the, the feedback. The blow back that I got for a joke about male feminists.

Speaker 1:          02:11:27       Yeah. No, I mean I've stepped on that landmine a couple of times and I keep going back to it. Cause it is, it is an important one. Uh, you know, men in the legal system, I mean not just the divorce, but I mean the sentencing disparities between men and women, like they called it pussy pass, you know, I mean it's, it's horrendous.

Speaker 2:          02:11:41       Call Feminism Marxists with pennies

Speaker 1:          02:11:43       because I socialism socialism, socialism with tits. But that was a bad character in one of my novels. But now I just go on the feminism, socialism and panties. And it's very true because I mean, and then people call, oh my God, that's so terrible. It's not, I just went through all the founding matriarchs of the feminist system. They're all Marxists, all leftist and so on. And also, if feminist is so pro woman, then where are they with Margaret Thatcher? Margaret Thatcher was like the first leader of a Western country. She struggled up from nothing. I made him incredibly powerful woman, but she was on the right QC. So they hate her. What about Iran? Iran wrote, wrote the most influential book outside the Bible. And the second most influential book in according to The New York Times review of books after the Bible, uh, you know, reshaped a western philosophy in many ways and western politics and the feminists hate or why?

Speaker 1:          02:12:32       Cause she was on the right cause he's, that's what they think. She was not actually on the right but so I mean I have these sorts of suspicions when there is sort of the, is it the leftist ideology or the pro woman? Now if it's the pro woman then they should be incredibly positive. Where are the feminist when people insult people like Ann Coulter, where are the feminists? When people insult Sarah Palin, you know, like Bill Maher, her called her a cunt. I mean that's really pretty vicious. Like publicly, openly, right? I mean where are the fee because they're on the rights and cultural are considered to be on the right. So they get a pass where people go, you know, but you then say something bad about a woman on the left. And so I think that it is more left than it is pro women because when they choose between their politics and the gender, they always seem to choose the politics over the agenda. And that's why I say it's left as rather than than pro woman.

Speaker 2:          02:13:19       I agree. And I think there's, there's a lot of really emotional and non objective thinking attached to feminism and there's a lot of, there's a lot of really strange. The, the, the, the, one of the more ones that I find

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       incredibly strange is this, uh, there's this new trend of accusing men of rate if they have sex with a woman who's had something to drink. This is a, uh, like a, a broad sweeping thing that's going through the Internet. And a lot of these, uh, it's really weird because it seems to be, there's a lot of it in this, what they call a skeptical community. And I, the skeptical community seems to be integrated with a lot of male feminists and feminist. And this is something that they've adopted this idea that somehow, or another skepticism and this idea, uh, that they, that they combine. And it's, I don't know if you're aware of the case that Michael Shermer thing you know about all about cues to some significant sexual impropriety, right? No evidence other than a person who doesn't want to reveal their name. Who He, the guy who wrote the piece heard about second hand.

Speaker 4:          02:14:22       Yeah. He didn't even hear about it directly from the person. And this is the person who's supposed to validate. They not see like I don't understand is it makes it, yes, he's getting sued now, but it's the idea of that being the skeptic community. I mean one of the things you learn as a skeptic when you're breaking down any idea, whether it's a religious idea or whether it's an idea about a, an event that took place is that a person's eye witness account of any individual event is suspect and that it's one of the worst forms of, of evidence. And it doesn't mean that a terrible thing didn't happen with this person, but it does mean that if you look at the, in the context of the way it was explained in this guy's blog is that she was put in a position where she couldn't consent.

Speaker 4:          02:15:06       Like what? What kind of Weirdo language is that? And then the, the corroborating evidence that he uses in this blog is that a woman went to a party with this guy and he kept giving her drinks and he was flirty and that she got drunker than she usually does. And that's it. That's the corroborating piece of evidence that the man and a woman who are both adults were drinking together and she got drunk. I mean, I, you talk about removing yourself from personal responsibility that he, this guy was responsible for you getting drunker. Like that's insane. Like that's insane for a person to say this, then we'll be drinks. What choice did I am a feminist? Like, why would you, how is it possible that a person who believes in the power of being woman could think that a woman is so much weaker than a man?

Speaker 4:          02:15:58       That she can't control how much liquor she consumes when she's around a man, but the man somehow or another, by being with her and drinking with her forces her to consume what you normally would. That's madness. And there's no excuse called I was drunk. I mean, try that with drunk driving, right? It's the whole point. Is that okay? Yes. You had diminished capacity while you were driving, but you were responsible for drinking and getting in the car. It's the one time when we're willing to alleviate someone of their own personal responsibility and only women. A man is more of a man who, if a man and man is more responsible, a man of women are dropped together. But the woman, uh, it feels bad about the encounter in the morning. The man raped her leaving. All the man was drunk as well. But the men are always the aggressors and always therefore guilty. I mean that's not humanism,

Speaker 1:          02:16:42       but that has taken, and this is a long dock road, uh, that as a man and you know, I'm sorry that if you're a woman, it's really hard to get this. We have had so much negativity over the past 40 or so years paroled and masculinity that, I mean, we were like half criminals just for breathing. I mean, if you look at the, the role models on TV, how, how men to portray, you know, the homeless Simpson's and the American dads and that they take, we're all just idiots and sex craze and irresponsible and stupid. And the amazing thing is that it's true. Then if you look at the bell curve of intelligence for women, it's kind of spikes in the middle. So many more women are of average intelligence than men. Now you still have your brilliant women, you still have your done with it.

Speaker 1:          02:17:26       But if you look at the bell curve of male intelligence, much flatter, which means that we have a lot more geniuses and lot more complete idiots, right? And what's happened is everybody's focused on the idiots among men. And I've completely began to ignore all the brilliance that men bring to the world. All of the amazing, incredible inventions that men bring to the world, and it's just we're focusing on this low cluster, which is incredibly biased. It's like saying, okay, what blacks in America, they commit more crimes and we're just going to focus on that and say that's all the black are and that's all we're going to portray as blacks, as criminals and blah, blah, blah. Would we incredibly racist, but the sexism of portraying men as idiots because we happen to have more cluster as a gender on that side and completely ignoring all of the incredible stuff that that brilliant men bring to the world. It's incredibly sexist and it's really hard for, for for people to see. I mean like the idea that you were talking earlier, the idea that a woman can competently raise children without a man around, it's just taken for granted. Now it's absolutely not true. Men are essential to the healthy raising of children, but the idea that we would recognize that as a society, it's just we were just the disposable.

Speaker 4:          02:18:27       It's also a very unfortunate situation went in in regards to feminism that uh, a lot of people are dealing with their own personal experiences that they've had with a few asshole men in their lives in regards to them not being sexually attractive or not fitting into a certain social group or not. And then they have somehow or another extrapolated that that all men are pieces of shit and rapists or a massive amount of them need to be curved and laws need to be changed. And if you get drunk with a girl and you have sex with her, you were a rapist, right? I mean, and a lot of this is based on their own negative interactions with men. And the stereotype of feminism unfortunately is like, there's a meme online, this is feminism. And it's a woman who, uh, has a, um, a, uh, of, of, of political holding up a sign saying I'm a feminist and she's fucking 300 pounds. And you know, and everyone's like, yeah, that's feminism. You know, like, this is, yeah, you're right. It's a big fat, ugly girl that no one's a fuck. That's really unfortunate. But the, the type of person

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       that is a large, unattractive woman is going to deal with and uh, in measurably, it's going to be so much harder for, for her to find people who are sexually attracted to her, for her to find a healthy relationships for her too. If you, it's an unfortunate reality in this world is that if you are not sexually attractive, you are not going to have as easy ride when it comes to the opposite sex. It's just a fact.

Speaker 1:          02:19:54       Well, I mean, but sexually attractive and 300 pounds, I mean, somebody who's 300 pounds is for most people are going to be sexually unattractive, but if they shouldn't lose weight and exercise, that's sort of a different matter. And that just comes down to a basic human competence. But one of the things that I've thought of, like I grew up with a single mom and we lived because single moms who used to be broke, right? I mean, because it's a test life. And so when I grew up with a single mom, everyone around me has single moms as well. You know, what's interesting is that the kind of men who float through single mom world, they're not always the best kind of men, right? They kind of trashy, right? Because like the really competent and successful and intelligent men on trawling, the girlfriend froms at the single mom, you know, they'll rent housing getups right, right.

Speaker 1:          02:20:36       And so I think what happens is a lot of these women have grown up in single mom households or, or in this sort of environment. And Sue who would, the men who floating through that, they tend to kind of be losers. They tend to be pretty unstable. They tend to be kind of parasitical. They, you know, they don't tend to be very, the very best specimens of, of masculinity. And so I think the breakdown of the family has created an environment where a lot of girls growing up don't have a positive male role model in their life. And the kind of end that they see floating through their mom's bands tend to be kind of trashy. So they're like, well, this is masculinity.

Speaker 2:          02:21:05       It's also very unfortunate that in a criticism of masculinity, you've removed a lot of allies. You know, by by blanket generalizations of men, you removed a lot of people like myself who I can't support you on that even though I'm the entirely approach human being and, and pro equality. But when you make these mass generalizations and call someone a men's right advocate asshole like that, these, these are nonsense statements. And it's unfortunate that I guarantee you these, and it's not saying that all feminists, feminists or unattractive or all feminists or uh, you know, uh, not, not, not sexually viable, but I guarantee you almost all of them, I've had a lot of negative experiences with men. And it doesn't mean that all men are negative. And it doesn't mean that there's not people out there that you would assume would be assholes, are actually very nice people.

Speaker 2:          02:21:56       But you've got this, uh, this idea that's, it's easier to define the world by these rigid dimensions that you've sort of set up for yourself. And when I, when I read things that are from this feminist point of view, there's so often aggressive and it's so often, and I get that there's a blowback. I do get that I get that they've experienced marginalization and they believe that, you know, society is set up to support rape culture and all these strange ideas and that there's a back to it. But I don't think that the way it's being handled is, I think it's, I don't think it's objective. I don't, I don't think it's rational and I don't think it's balanced. And, uh, I, I find it really weird when really intelligent people have attached themselves to these feminist ideas.

Speaker 1:          02:22:42       Yeah. And, and, but the problem is, you know, in Canada here, I had a guy on my show, a great game, Bill Gehringer who wrote, um, uh, the end of the family and what it was, and he pointed out that there's a revolution that occurs. I think that initially is necessary. And I think this is also with Latin America too. There's a revolution that occurs that is initially necessary, but the whole point of a revolution is to defund itself to end, right? So yeah, I mean there was stuff that needed to be done. Obviously we've talked about the, certainly with blacks in the 60s and some stuff with women's kind of different, right? So cause women, there's always been this women and children first, right? Like the vast majority of the people who died at the titanic, we're men offering up their lifeboats to women, right? Cause there has been a sort of women and children first and women have been kind of elevated.

Speaker 1:          02:23:24       There was no black people for us in the south right there. So it's a little bit different. But there was, I think some push for quality that needed to happen. But then what happens is you get a lot of people who get heavily invested in this course and the becomes their ego, their identity, right? Like I fight for black wives, I fight for women's rights and so on. But then what happens is society will often listen and respond in a positive way. And then what happens is that course begins to diminish and people are like, you know, supporting like, I'm not going to support to the abolitionist cause because slavery is ended, like I just not tend to do it and it's over, right? I mean, there may be other problems, but that's not the problem, right? Like ours, I don't to support a lot of, uh, you know, let's, let's deal with polio victims because we've got this vaccine and we don't really have polio victims anymore.

Speaker 1:          02:24:05       Right? So the whole point of a revolution is to defund itself, to end for people to move on with their lives. But what happens is when you have government, you get these voting blocks and you get, like in Canada, over the last 10 or 15 years, Katie government's given $300 million to feminist groups. That's not coming from Canadian women or Canadian men for that matter. Because you know, a lot of it's kind of been dealt with. But these groups continue by by poking these scabs and by continuing these grievances and my finding the Trayvon Martin situation and blowing it up into a race war. And all this kind of stuff. A lot of the stuff has been dealt with, but because the government's still given the money, they still need to work up. These kinds of hysteria is there just to justify their own existence. I mean the whole point of a revolution is to end. The whole point of I want to deal with measles is get a vaccine and end measles, you know, keep taking the same amount of money that year after year, but if you have a government funding it, then you have to manufacture these grievances, which just keeps things going and getting worse. The point of revolution as a resolution

Speaker 2:          02:24:59       and this resolution never seems to come play. It's never going to take place if your approach is imbalanced and there's just some things that are being some proponents of feminism or endorsing one of them being the ability to withdraw consent equals rape. The ability to,

Speaker 1:          02:25:16       you mean after the fact it's after the fact. Yeah. That's sending you consented to be giving you my coffee and then charging you with theft when you walk out the room. Yeah. Take my coffee. Oh, officer, he stole my coffee because I changed my mind after the fact when he left.

Speaker 2:          02:25:29       Well, the idea is that a man can lie to a woman in order to get in bed with her and then if she can prove that he did that, that she, that he's a rapist because he tricked her with his words.

Speaker 1:          02:25:38       Yeah, because of course we're going to have a lie. I mean they don't use makeup. They don't puff up their tits. They don't ever falsify any of their like a man because he's wealthy and hope to get

Speaker 2:          02:25:47       pregnant with the music. I mean, I don't see any feminists that are the crime that, and that's a, that's a horrible front to womanhood. The think that the only way that you could make a live in is to lie to a man and make him get you pregnant so that you can get money from him. From then on. I mean, feminists, true feminists should be horrified by that.

Speaker 1:          02:26:04       It was all focus on the false rape accusations, false rape accusations, which in some studies are 2030 or 40% of the study in the air force. But they actually, even women who have withdrawn their accusations, 2030 or 40% of rent, rent accusations in some studies, who knows what it is universally are our false. I mean, how horrendous that and women should be coming down so hard. I'm women who make false rape accusations cause they make it so much harder for the women who actually happen, right? Because then there's that problem or a false paternity. And the problem with false rape accusations are very few women face repercussions for them. Now in my book, if you can, if you accuse someone of a crime and you lied, you get the punishment, they would have gotten you shit. How it shaped green.

Speaker 2:          02:26:45       This football player who has recently been released, uh, he got on tape, this girl a admitting that she lied about him being him raping her and her family received $1 million or $850,000 and now they, you know, they, they have to pay the money back. But that's the extent of her punishment. This guy went to jail for five fucking years, you know, and now he's just trying to read, pursue report. He'd still be there. Well, not only that, he's just one of many. I have three friends that were falsely accused of rape. I also have friends that were raped. I know that there's, I know rape is real. You know, I have friends who've have been roofie and you know, got out of danger because someone recognizes the hadn't been drug. It's, it's very common. You know, rape is a disgusting, Horrible Anti Human Crime and I think rape is, should be treated the same way as murderers. You're, you're denying someone their humanity you're doing, you're taking away something, some part of them, you're removing a part of the w

Speaker 1:          02:27:40       who they are as a person that's kind of permanent. Yeah. Somebody, you can get a new car, but there's something about sexual violation, but it's kind of a permanent,

Speaker 2:          02:27:47       it's horrible, but so is lying about it. That's horrible to lying about. A rape is just as hard a lot of it. But often we get a man, right? Yes, yes. And this idea of this idea of withdrawing consent, you know, and that somehow or another you could do that and turn a guy into a rapist. That's, that's like hating thing that's, uh, you don't, you, you know what you're doing is you're, you're, you're, you're hating someone who's manipulative. You're hating someone who can con you into bed. But that's been what men have been trying to do since the beginning of time. Like you're heating of the game of courting a woman. And there have been men that wear shoes that they would never wear and watches me would never buy. And cars, they don't give a shit about an apartment that they decorate just to get the woman to believe that they're like this. It's all alive. My friend Brian, we saw earlier tonight, last night for sure. Um, Brian Callahan, so hilarious guy, the first time that came over his house back when he was single, he had Jack Kerouac on the road sitting on his night table opened up.

Speaker 2:          02:28:52       And I, you know, I'm a Predator, so I came over his house. I'm like, did she may have written that? You know, I, I find weakness that people very quickly. So I saw that. I go, you're not fucking reading that. I go, you're, you're hoping to. Chick comes over and she sees that and she's like, Oh, you read. So polling are amazed that he's there. He started laughing. He goes,

Speaker 3:          02:29:09       true, true. I decorate my house to pretend I'm smarter than I am. I did that. There was a Stephen Hawking book, a brief history of time or whatever, right? And I had that on my desk and this woman, I loved her to death. We went out for a while. This woman came over and she's like, I call bullshit. I call bullshit on stuff later. And I'm like, no, no, no. I've read it. And she, what she did is she went over and she opened it and it creates like an old boat and it never made it open before. And it didn't go into his spine was completely unvetted. They're like, you know what? You got me.

Speaker 2:          02:29:41       That's nurses. That's hilarious. We lie, we pretend, you know, I've always, I have this thing and I say people, and I think a lot of times we lie and pretend it was a big part of us because we're not happy with who we are, where we're not really and we like to be. We would like to wish that we were somewhat better. I always tell people, be the person that you pretend to be when you're trying to get laid, you are your life optimally. You want to really be an admirable person. Be The hero of your own story and be the guy that you pretend to be when you try to get laid and if you can find people who love you for who you are. I mean, my God, isn't that easier? Yeah. The problem with the pretenses, you know, it's fine in the moment, but man, you've got to keep that shit up.

Speaker 2:          02:30:19       That's a lot of work and you have to love yourself to, in order to be loved. If you have all sorts of flaws that you don't fix and you don't like various aspects of yourself that you don't correct what normal person, they're normal and they're, they're, they're sensible. Mine would want to engage in a longterm relationship with some of this incredibly flawed knows it and does nothing about it. Like that sounds like a nightmare. That's how like taking out a dog that shits all over the house, you know, you're, you, you, you're just taking out a giant problem. You gotta fix this person. And some people do do that. They take on projects, you know what I mean? I have a friend who every fucking girlfriend and dates, it's always broken and that he can never see that your problem is your own life is a mess and you don't want to deal with that.

Speaker 2:          02:31:00       So you bring people into your life that are more fucked up and you could fix up some of their problems. Advice, yeah. We constantly give them advice. So you're going to fix them, but fixing yourself, bitch. And if you did fix yourself, you wouldn't want these people in your life. If I did a 300 pound woman, the fact that I'm to 80, it looks better. So I don't have to diet. I look smaller right next. Her. Yeah. I mean, I think that that is a huge part of w what's wrong with people in relationships? What's wrong with a lot of people in relationships is internal. It's what's wrong with you? What are you bringing into a relationship until you are happy with who you are until you're, you're, you're, uh, just a, a, a reasonable person who's objective about your own actions and objective about your own path in life and enjoying your own path in life. You're not worthy of a healthy, happy relationship. You haven't gotten your own shit together yet. Wow. This is terrible. I think dichotomy where, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:31:54       women get married to guys hoping that they'll change and you guys getting back to women hoping that they wound, you're not going to cut that long hair. I, you like when you have kids, right? I mean, you're going to keep exercising, right? You're still going to look right. Right. And, and all that. And I mean, the idea that you're with someone in the hopes that they'll change, it's just completely insane. It's like buying a Buick and helping. It's going to be a boat. I mean, it's not what you bought it. Them thinking about bogus, ridiculous. Well, there are a lot of women who like to do that though. They would like to fix fixing change definitely at him and he's going to be

Speaker 2:          02:32:24       right. It's a throw things out. Like, where's that, where's that book? I shouldn't read that.

Speaker 3:          02:32:29       Or, or you know, there's still three Adams holding my underwear together. How dare you put them in the garbage.

Speaker 2:          02:32:34       I have a friend and uh, his, uh, girlfriend, uh, he went to the bathroom and his girlfriend was confronted by my other friend's girlfriend about the kind of car he drives cars. He drove a sports car and he had a Ferrari. He's a wealthy guy. And the, the girlfriend was like, why don't you let him drive that car? He let him drive that car. That was her words. Like your guy driving a car like that. It's like, you know, he's like, he's like, why do you let them have that college? She was correcting him because she was concerned that her boyfriend might get ideas. Like I can get a car like that too because my friend has a dog. So she wanted to, what? She was worried about her and she did it in front of her man. I like to check him. She went to this girl and was correcting her situation of a fucking car.

Speaker 2:          02:33:21       I mean it was like decisive. You've got time. Don't you have shit to do with your life rather than a woman. Trouble them manipulate. And she was incredibly manipulative. This woman and uh, you know those, those people are not in my life anymore. But this woman was incredibly manipulative and she, she would, the guy was like a, a wealthy, strong guy. But for whatever reason, this attractive woman came in and was life and just started dominating him. She didn't work. I paid for everything and she wouldn't let him do shit. She, she chose everything that he did. She dressed him. She bought clothes for him and he was not allowed to buy a sports car. She not as anything great about having a sports car. But I don't understand if you're going to be a capitalist, you've gotta be a materialist, which they clearly worry this big giant house. She would buy whatever the fucking car you want. If you're really going to bust your ass and work 12 hours a day. I'm not saying there's any great honor or no ability and buying a Ferrari, but if you really want a Ferrari and you've got a lot of money by a fucking Ferrari, who gives a shit

Speaker 3:          02:34:19       that reminds me best moment into Peter Joseph interview because I'm, we're doing it. I'm doing a debate with him on Monday. Ah, cause uh, we have slightly different ideas about how the future should go and we'd have a debate and as I listened to your, uh, your, your show with it, which is really enjoyable and I love the, where he said, you know, you know, they, they could make better cars, you know, like the Ferrari, they could make that better. And you're like, no, they absolutely could not make that car any better than it is anyways. With something like that was like, I mean, that's the pinnacle of human engineering to shut the fuck up. Yeah. Like, I mean, unless you're going to have like an angel's wings and wheels that you cannot improve that car. That's about as good as you get sort of silly socialist ideology where you don't vet your facts out before you start blabbing. You know? You can't say they can make them better Porsche. No, they fucking race the 24 hours a la Mons, they competing as the best cars in the world. They brilliantly engineered these vehicles. Guys know the uptake from the Porsche is the fucking teleporter and stuff. Right. There's no better way to get around that when people talk. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:35:19       To me like that, like they can make a better car. No, they cannot stop. You don't know what you're talking about. You don't know the history of what you're saying. What you're doing is saying something that goes along with your ideology. You would like it to be true because it would make you more brilliant.

Speaker 3:          02:35:34       Good, make your points. But if I have to bend facts to meet your theories, that exit of brilliant. Right. It have to be a slave to the facts. Right. He's got it.

Speaker 2:          02:35:41       Great thing going on. He's got a really interesting thing going on but it's very culty you know is there's a lot of, there's, there's a lot of cultiness to that and it's also, it all falls out the window when you realize that he's a stockbroker. He was for, he still does still does it. So he makes his money. Really? Yes. He's a day trader.

Speaker 3:          02:36:00       It doesn't, you get people to like rip out their kidneys and emailed them to him or something that isn't that what the cedars, it's unlikely the guy trying to run a call if he's a very smart guy and I don't think he believes he's sort of a frustrated

Speaker 2:          02:36:13       musician and a day trader. Yeah. Very bright guy and

Speaker 3:          02:36:17       Moxley play the stock market and mocks bank has made and then it kicked her out when she had a baby. Cause you know exploiting the working classes is really bad. Right, exactly. It just kind of do it as well as the capitalist.

Speaker 2:          02:36:29       That's my problem. There's a lot of those guys out there that become intoxicated with the attention that you get from having good ideas, you know? And that's a, that's a real common occurrence and human nature. Whenever someone gets to talk and people listen and go, you're amazing. You just, you know, oh, I'm amazing. You don't go, hmm. Does that person just dumb?

Speaker 3:          02:36:49       Maybe like I need, I need more of you all, all the smart people out the room. I even move you and your second cousins, especially if you've bred together, bring me your children. They'll just fit right in. I'm always the first point out that every single thing that ever comes out an office, essentially just some things that I've read and you've very humbled about that. And you opened, he said like, I'm not smart enough to understand this. I don't really get that, but she's in my thoughts. And that is important. Yeah. Cause I mean, nobody has the answers the best. I mean, I like what Socrates did.

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       The best you can do is provoke thought. I mean, how many answers have we given the people in this conversation? Not really. Well, don't get your kids, you know, that's one reason with your kids, maybe you stay home with them if you can then he of anyway, but, but those are sort of, I mean that's such common sense that the fortunate or unfortunate put me but big answers, you know, man, I think the oldest really worried about that. You know, the moral instructors of mankind and usually complete control freaks and ourselves

Speaker 2:          02:37:43       Senate grey, I think it's almost impossible. I think we all together can work things out by talking and exchanging ideas and exchanging opinions and agreeing and seeing each other's points of view. I think we could help that way we can all help each other. But the idea that one person is going to be the more moral authority or the voice of Wisdom, it's a very dangerous position.

Speaker 1:          02:38:05       It really is. I been, there's a few things that are uncomfortable saying people shouldn't do, but outside of that, I have no idea what is going to make you the happiest in life. I mean, yeah, don't steal. Don't kill dunk. Right, fine, fine, fine. But even how many people really do that? Not many. Right? But actually how people should live. I mean, man, if it doesn't, we can start pointing guns at each other and we can stop having these crazy laws. Stop throwing people in jail for the wrong bits of vegetation. I think that would be a great step forward. You know, let's just stop pointing guns at each other, gets get stuff done. Outside of that, I have no idea what people should do to make themselves happy. And if that's you're legitimately intelligence and half the time I'm not even sure myself, right? I mean, you sit there and say, well, what should I do with my day that's going to make me the happiest? It's nice to have to try so whatever. Right? But as to what other people should do, you know, who they should be with and what careers they should follow. I mean, that's really, it's impossible. It's hard to know. It's a very important,

Speaker 2:          02:38:55       yeah, you bring up that. Especially because there's so many things that people like that I don't, there's so many things that I liked the people don't like. I've had a really, really intelligent friends that go, why do you like this mixed martial arts stuff? I don't know. I just do. I like it. Did I know, I understand that it's, it's a controlled violence. I understand that it's a, it's a disturbing for some people to watch, but to me, it's been a part of my life since I was a boy. And, uh, I, you know, I find it incredibly fascinating. Sorry, you don't, it's okay. You know, you know, and by the way, the people that I've met that are mixed martial artists are fighters, are some of the nicest people I've ever met in my life. And one of the reasons is that they've conquered their ego to a certain extent, and that they have a much better control over it because they're being checked over and over again on a daily basis in the gym.

Speaker 1:          02:39:40       Oh, discipline is highly underrated. Virtue. I think it used to be more highly rated discipline. I mean, the discipline to say when you're wrong, you're wrong. I mean, that's what bothers me so much about people. It's this lazy edges of their permission slips. You know? Like I was like, when people do like really stupid shit out of me, it's just like how, how has that, how do you give yourself permission to do that? Like how has that, how was that on your list of possible things to do and still be happy about yourself or, or even like how has that, you know, you know, I hit my kid. How is that? Like how was that even on your list possibilities? How do you have, like, why would you just say, no, I'm not going to do that and have the discipline to not do it. That seems to be pretty obvious.

Speaker 2:          02:40:20       It's very underrated aspect of being a man of being a human is having a code that you live with.

Speaker 1:          02:40:24       Yeah, some self discipline. Like, I mean the guys would get up at 5:00 AM workout and stuff like that. Like, you know, the other day I was like, yeah I can be like most people are like, oh I'm kind of tired trying to work out or having that, you know and you know part of you's like, oh what an app would be nice right now because she's like, yeah go do a word better feel better and just sleep better that night cause you didn't have an happen scrub your cycle. So just that kind of discipline is, is really lacking. I think we used to have a lot more of it when we were really confronted with nature a lot more. And how will you live in this fuzzy city where you can get everything 24 seven it's all easy to come by and so on. And we've got kind of, and the material listen to me comes with the laziness and the lease.

Speaker 1:          02:41:00       And this comes with the depth because we talk about national debts and so on. I mean in, in America and to some degree is almost as bad in Canada to people like have debts and way bigger than their income. And that's a kind of laziness too. Like, what's with the different, like why not the first and gratification, you know, they're gonna study on kids. It's called the marshmallow study. They take four year olds and they sit them down and they say, you can have two marshmallows now. Sorry, you can have one. You can't, you, you can have two marshmallows now or you can have for marshmallows if you have to. If you have one now and wait, they're always take two now. Well No, there's some of them that that will differ real and there's some of them that won't and they track these kids through life and they find that consistently those were able to defer gratification.

Speaker 1:          02:41:41       Just do a hell of a lot better. I bet you there were times when you got up to do fear factor and you're like, if there's one thing I don't want to do today, it's fear factor, but I mean the discipline to just get up and you know what I mean? What Woody Allen says, you know, 90% of success is just showing up. That's kind of the discipline to do it when you don't feel like doing it. Then deferral of gratification. I'm sure with the training there's times with the address kicked butt, you'd pull the muscle and just like, well, I'm going to go back and do it. Or there's times where like that she's getting looks like I'm, well I'm drooling like a tsunami here, but you just don't do it. And I think that kind of discipline. Um, so you said that the fibers are like really great guys. I think it's because they probably would've worked that muscle of discipline to the point where they have a code, they have a set of personal responsibilities and they don't let themselves step outside of that. And so there's a kind of security and people who have a lot of discipline in whatever field it is that they're working in. A, I really like being around people who have got a lot of discipline because you know, they're not just going to do some random shit. It's awesome

Speaker 2:          02:42:38       firing to me. Yeah. I like being around people that work hard. It's, it makes me feel like I should get things done to accomplish things and people accomplish things around you and they're, they're, they've, they've experienced joy and success and, and they experience this feeling of, wow, I did it. I pulled it off. That's inspiring. It makes you want to do the same. It makes you want to and the more things I accomplished and the more things I do, well the happier I am as a person I find as a direct correlation.

Speaker 1:          02:43:04       Do you have a, a plan that, I know you said you was, it's a little bit, you know, grab what you can and as far as your career goes in a little on the lesson plan side, but do you have a sort of an idea of what you want to go five years, you know, 10 years kind of thing? Um, no, no, I uh, I'm here, this sort of,

Speaker 2:          02:43:23       yeah, while I'm here, you know what I'm doing right now. I love, I really a, I like to keep doing it and my plan is to continue to do it. But if I, if everything maintained exactly where it is right now, I don't think I would do anything differently. I think it would continue to work on my standup. I continued to do a commentary for the fights. I've continued to do podcasting and I enjoy all those very much. I continue to try to be the best father I can continue to try to be the best husband I can, all that good stuff. But other than that, no, I don't have any plans, my plans or just enjoy life. And I enjoyed life very much. My plans were to maintain that enthusiasm and that happiness, the joy of life. Uh, and it spread as much of that as I can inspire people if I can. And, uh, and it just inspired people by enjoying myself. How's other people have inspired me by enjoying their lives. Um, I'm inspired constantly by people love their craft, like people who love their profession, but people love what they do is so it's very infectious, you know? So that's, that's the only girls in our house.

Speaker 1:          02:44:25       And that's, I mean, that's sort of the definition of a happy life that if it continues the way it is, that's pretty damn good. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:44:31       Yeah. And you know, and maybe grows and maybe, uh, maybe gets some, I would like to get better and everything that I'm doing that I enjoy, but you have to, I, in Jujitsu, you don't maintain to get better. And comedy, you don't maintain, you get better. If you continue to focus on it and you learn from your, your, your past experiences, you're going to improve. If you apply intelligence and focus to anything, you're going to get better at it. There's, it's not like you can become a master at comedy, even if you are a master, you know, you call yourself a black belt. In comedy, there's, there's, there's room, there's always room. This room in Jujitsu, there's room and martial arts, there's room and everything.

Speaker 1:          02:45:06       I left the disciplines with no limits. But you can't ever say this is the end.

Speaker 2:          02:45:10       It's never ends. There's no, there's no like, you're never a total master. It's not possible. I mean, you, you can teach and you, you will have a certain amount of math. Like there's certain moves that I cannot teach someone in Jujitsu, but could I teach you Jujitsu mastery? Yeah. Something you have to like sort of pursue on your own and most likely you'll never achieve. You might have a master, you might be masterful over one particular skill level, but then someone else come along that is much more skillful than you and master you. You know, it's, it's, it's a constant series of levels and it's fairly infinite. And then there's also, you know, the physical challenges and, uh, you know, athletic ability and all sorts of intangibles that different people bring to the equation. But I think that in pursuit of those things, it's where you find yourself and that they're, they're really, uh, the interesting aspects of it is the, the growth that you achieve in those things, whether it's through the growth in writing comedy or anything difficult, those things manifest itself, manifest themselves in the rest of your life as well. You get better at everything. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:46:18       I sort of asked you, is there a dream guest fear

Speaker 2:          02:46:20       podcasts that we cannot if he was alive, he had his brother on a fascinating guy. Um, the Dreamcast I think I've already had, you know, I, I would like more of the same. You right. Neil degrasse Tyson was great. Um,

Speaker 3:          02:46:36       he's one charismatic guy, you know, it's great to have someone in front and center, rational thinker. We're putting it out to the masses, that beautiful

Speaker 2:          02:46:42       Mainer team from tools. Great. Graham Hancock's, but so many great guests. I just, I just, I enjoy doing it. I enjoy talking to people, but I think it's, it's broadened my perspective immensely to be able to have these kinds of conversations like you and I sitting down here for hours just chatting. I think that's a, it's really difficult to pull off in the real world, you know? Yes. We're agreeing to have a podcast. It's really hard to just set aside three hours where we're just going to talk. It's hard.

Speaker 3:          02:47:11       Oh, it's an incredible privilege. I mean, I feel incredibly fortunate to have the opportunity to have conversations like this or other people I do. On my show. I mean, you know, but it's going to be a dad. I got all the parenting experts in the no university come on my show. It was like, Ooh, you know, so I get to learn it. How do people get to learn? I mean, it's an incredible privilege and this technology that makes it possible and then he's amazing. It's fantastic.

Speaker 2:          02:47:33       Yeah. They're like, look how little we're using here. I mean, you have a camera set up and thank goodness you have them.

Speaker 3:          02:47:38       I could record verse 27 minutes. We didn't even get this and that was the gold stuff, but this is just a little piece of, you know, electronics and it's plugged into the wall and that's it. And maybe a million people here. This molded, it goes in the world for ever more harm. More than a million really? Because each one of my downloads is over half a million. Right. At the minimum. 1 million. Can we start again then? Because I was seeing like a little rusty, but is that how many times you've been there, a standup comedy show before? Oh, I used to do a lot. I mean, I used to go to a lot when I was in the business world, we'd have clients come up and I'd always want to take it to a comedy club cause it sure beats a movie. Right? And so I used to go see a lot of comedy.

Speaker 3:          02:48:19       I did a little bit, you know, just some amateur shit when I was uh oh you did? Yeah. So and uh, yeah, just open like stuffing, it wasn't really my thing, but uh, it was fun to go up and try. I was like doing that sort of stand on the cliff edge thing. Uh, but I, uh, I love stand up. I think, I think what you guys do is like fantastic. I think it's just a real ray of sunshine in human like, and what you give is, is, is you give permission for people to be, to be funny themselves, to, to have fun and the joy that you guys have. The one the things I love most about stand up and you know the breaking bit, and you did it a couple of times last night where you did something that's so funny that you yourself found it funny because maybe it was unrehearsed or something spontaneous, or you had a thought because that's seeing somebody who have joined the moment is really, really enjoyable.

Speaker 3:          02:49:06       If it's real, that's not really all I know. There's some people that do like fake breaks or they'll laugh at their jokes a fucking billion times in a row and every time you see them they'll laughing at the same way. It's kind of gross. But last night I was working on a bunch of new stuff, so that was one of the reasons why I thought it was so funny. Yeah, and I mean, you know, going back and forth, but the crowd, I mean it's, it's really amazing to, to see the, the energy that you have a, I think people don't see the kind of energy that really energized standup comedian path. They may see it at a rock show, you know, but this is the lead singer. Some Freddie Mercury stuff or whatever. Right? But when you go to see standup, you see somebody who's really putting out a lot of energy.

Speaker 3:          02:49:43       And I think it reminds people that they can be incandescence. They don't have to be like these Dell embers, which most people trudge through their days and their cubicles and whatever. I just dragging themselves around. But I think seeing people really energized, it reminds you that it is inspiring. It reminds you that did, you can be energetic, that you can be powerful, that you can be commanding, that you can be generous. Cause stand up comedy is very generous in my opinion. Cause so vulnerable. I mean, you're out there like I made to get to get a laugh or not, you know, like I did the acting and I didn't do much accommodated some, but I mostly did like the serious stuff. And if the theater is quiet, you can just pretend that they're really moved and you know, crying and all that sort of stuff. But if you're going for laughter, I mean it's the hair, it's not, it's hanging out there.

Speaker 3:          02:50:23       Right. And so I think I'm not gonna want to tell you your job because of course, you know what, a million times better than I do. But what I really love about the stand up is just that openness, the honesty, the vulnerability, and the energy. It's funny that you should call it generous to a lot of people think of it as selfish because what you're trying to, you, you're the only reason why you're being vulnerable because you're hoping that you're gonna get a laugh. You know your you're yet, but you kind of and make them alive. The life has to come honest, right? I mean, if you bomb, nobody laughs out of generosity. Right? That's true. And there's ha yeah, or like, and then, then the [inaudible] has come out of the woodwork and then you're fighting a losing battle and all that. Now I do. I feel anybody who provides services of vulnerability and when you're out there selling your CD's on the street, poets is a vulnerability.

Speaker 3:          02:51:02       And so I view it as a very generous thing to stand up, come clean is still, of course you get paid and you know [inaudible] nobody. It's not like self sacrifice. You enjoy what you do, but the audience has to know that you really care about them having a good time in order for it to work. I stay around after the show and take pictures with everybody have to do that and you get a helicopter to your layer and a right Smith could take the Atlanta tunnels or whatever you do. That to me is a part of the the the generosity idea. Yeah. I think it's important that reinforces the relationship that aren't even appreciate them very much and the, you know, I'd be happy to take pictures with them and if it takes an hour and a half out of my day after the show's over and that's great. Fine. So far for real work there at that point, what I need to lie down and get me some cold competence and show 'em I actually put in work that's a, what is the prep if you don't get the curtain? Well right now I'm working on a lot of new material. So right now there's a lot of writing involved during the day. The day of show, I like to sit down in front of my computer at least three or four hours

Speaker 2:          02:52:06       and write because it really like fires up all my synopsis and Co Coalesces All these ideas together. And then before the show I write things down physically in longhand form. But like, um, the day of the show, like all this stuff that I wrote about the Toronto Mayor of all that, that was all I wrote that the day that was all new material that I wrote specifically because of this silly guy. It's crazy. Yeah, it's amazing. It's about to good stuff. I'd forgotten about him cause you know, I kind of blank out on politics as much as possible cause I know it's like dandelion fluff in the winter. It'll sting your eyes, but that's my prep. Um, I, I feel like I can definitely do shows without that. I mean I can just go and do a show, would not, you know, I have enough material, I could just go and do a show right now.

Speaker 2:          02:52:47       Like, you know, open that door and there's comedy club and they get on stage and it'll work out. But to do it best, I have to prepare, I have to write, especially when the materials new, there's like a lot of stuff that I have to make sure that certain tag lines after remember. And it's like there's so much memory involved in somebody past that half to, and then there's also experiments. I have to figure out what's the right path. Like sometimes I'll, I'll open up with this and then I'll close with that. Like, you know, like last night I close with all this stuff on being a Vegan.

Speaker 1:          02:53:17       That's, I wouldn't give to the last line away. But that last line was like a brand in my head. I like thought about that all the way. Oh yeah. Go see the shallow if yeah. Listening to this. But that last line was like, that was the perfect choice for me.

Speaker 2:          02:53:29       Oh, thank you. Well, that's how you want to end it. Boom. Thanks. Tonight. Yeah. Leave them wanting more. Yeah. Um, I wanted to ask you, because I, I, this is something that I ask of, uh, pretty much anybody who I think is a thinker is like looking at this crazy life that we live. Do you have, do you have a positive

Speaker 6:          02:53:49       yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:53:50       Outlook for the, for humans, for culture. Do you, did you think that we're going to work this out? Do you, are you a voice of doom guy or you, uh, do you think like, you know what, I, I think this is actually moving in the right direction ultimately.

Speaker 6:          02:54:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:54:07       Yes. Yeah. How long? Like guy, after so many words and the most important question they give you one, but, uh, I think that

Speaker 6:          02:54:16       okay,

Speaker 1:          02:54:17       the world will go how the most important and energetic people will make it go. Right. So I don't believe that I'm along for the ride. I am not a big movement in history kind of guy. You know, like aliens are Marxists starting to get old bullshit and technical, but they all believe that, that he's big historical movements. Then you know that the, the Zeitgeists and this and that and the other end, we're all just kind of along for the ride. Like, you know, eat grits on the back of the hippo. I don't believe that. I believe in the single great willpower, individual theory of history that when people who have ability and intelligence and passion and commitment, they're the ones who make the world go in a particular direction, right? Founding fathers did, did it one way and it went I think at a pretty positive direction.

Speaker 1:          02:55:01       You know, once the slaves and women got caught up with the all men are equal kind of thing, it makes it a pretty positive direction. You look at Rosa PM, the reign of terror in the French revolution abandoned a break. They had direction. If you look at, um, um, the, the Soviets and the Russian revolution in 1917, a lending and company [inaudible] seriously bad direction and killed like 70 million people in the Soviet Empire, right? But these are all individuals, all individuals with particular abilities making choices. So I don't believe that the world is going to get better and less people who can make it get better. I think in in entropy as things get worse, right? I mean, the, the, the lowest common denominator and the worst demagogues tend to take over, but you can really fight against that. And I'm a single hero of theory of history. Like you just, you take a stand as best you can and you shine that light as bright as possible.

Speaker 1:          02:55:51       And then most people will simply go one way or another based upon the willpower of the individuals that they listened to and, and the clarity and the focus and humility of the people that listened to yourself. Um, I think that it goes the way we want it to go, but it's not going to go there unless we make it go to a better place. I think you're right. I think that's a brilliant way of putting it too. I think, um, we do get energized from others and the people that do have power and influence do have almost an obligation to energize people ideas. Yeah. Look, if, if, if you know how to do the Heimlich and someone's choking on a fish bone, go help that person. You know, if you could swim and someone's drowning, go help that person. You have ideas to make the world better that you think we don't do express them.

Speaker 1:          02:56:32       Yeah, I mean there's, I mean I don't believe in hand chosen positive obligations. Like if you choose a contract and you're bound by that contract, I don't think you have to put your kind of a Dick if you don't, you know, like if you're like, oh I don't wanna give that guy a tracheotomy because this Ravioli is really good. Even though you could say if the guy's life, it's not like you should be thrown in jail for that. But it's really Douchey, you know? And I think if you have verbal abilities and you have skills and you have energy and your education and you have some capacity and given how easy it is to, to broadcast to the world by God, you kind of owe it to the future. You know? Cause all the great stuff that we have was people putting themselves on the line in the past.

Speaker 1:          02:57:10       You know, all the grain, like the freedoms that we have, the, the political freedoms, all people fighting hard and a hell of a lot harder than we have to fight. You know, the guys are there, the founding fathers they face down in the British Army for God sakes. They could've gotten muskets through the head, right? And Musket ball through the head. Why do we go, oh maybe some people might say bad things about me online. It's not exactly Joan of arc stuff, right? So we have an incredible platform. We have so little downside to, to bringing light to the world that that's what drives me every day is just I want, and especially again, when you're coming down, you really your, your whole timeframe extent, it's not about your life. It's about, and now my daughter's going to outlive me, but like 40 years, I hope, right? 50 years.

Speaker 1:          02:57:45       And it really is about, I just can't let the assholes take over cause assholes love to do, to be in charge. Right. And the problem is good people to add that bossy because good people like live and let live. And you know, I didn't want to be in your face and in your business. And you know what? I can to separate ourselves, love to be in charge. And they keep congregating at the top of power. And I don't want to be at the top of power. I don't want to be a politician. I don't want to have power over others. I think that's the ring has to go in the fire. There's no way that they use in our, and so the problem is that bad people are just anal and motivated and Douchey and power hungry and they just work like assholes to get power over others.

Speaker 1:          02:58:24       And good people are like, wow, I don't even want that power cause I'm happy and I'm in love. And you know, I've got a great life and so I really don't want to boss everyone else around. But we have through this technology, we don't have to have political power to have an effect. And we don't have to be a professor and teach maybe 5,000 people. They're not, we'll Korea or write some book that maybe 10,000 people read. 1 million people can listen to this from what you and I spending a couple of hours having a great fucking conversation. I mean, Ooh, what matters that we, you know, and we can do that now. First Time in history. It's interesting. There's no burning at the stake there. We're not getting burned alive as witches were not being thrown into, you know, Russian lines like soldier Nixon. I mean we have this, it's when, when we have a great conversation, the world hopefully gets the nuggets of wisdom and we turned the ship a little bit more towards the light.

Speaker 1:          02:59:06       I agree. I think there's a great way to end this. Alright, thank you so much. [inaudible] your website for my listeners, Joe rogan.net Joe Rogan Demos, freedom Maine radio.com. Um, all books are free or podcasts are free. Now advertising because I have the business sense of a boxer g string and your youtube channel. Oh yes. youtube.com forward slash freedom and reading. Well, you know, I don't, I think you have a great business sense because you've accumulated this massive fallen sort of few, few wanted to sell something. Now it'd be the time. How to think about it builds up the awesome core audience. So that's right. And I've held off from Sally something. So the first thing I sell is going to be great baby. Just some gold actually. Well, I am. I mean, it's not for sale, but a documentary is coming out pretty soon. I've had good fortunate to work with Sean Lennon and some other great musicians too. What's the documentary? It's called truth because I'm very modest. It's basically a, it's a documentary about what's wrong with the world and how we should fix it for, on philosophic. Cause let me know when it comes out. I would have you promoted. Thank you very much Joe time. Thank you very much. There's a lot of fun.

Speaker 6:          03:00:15       [inaudible].
