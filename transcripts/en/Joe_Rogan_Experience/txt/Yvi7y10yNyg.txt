Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Yes, sir. Cheers. Cheers. And we're live and we're live so much. Talk about so much to talk about years. It's been awhile. It's been awhile. And uh, one of the reasons why you're here, it's because I was mostly of Jackson. I mean, we should just get right into this. You can't do it or should we let them at the Budweiser? I haven't even eat breakfast. I didn't eat breakfast. I'm like, I'm going to drink beer with you. I already know he's getting me beer. And that way it can hit me a lot faster and I'll loosen up my lips a lot sooner. We can do whatever you want. It's up to you. You look in thick dude. How much do you weigh now, man? So I've been, um, so here's a crazy story I go to, I go to, um, the Pi to, Cause Dana tells me I can't go to 55.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       So I go to talk to tell you, you can't go. Why? Look at, he says I'm getting old and older and just say, he said old, I'm getting old and card, right. So I said, I'm going to go to the, to the bi. You guys have this amazing facility with the pis, towns for a performance institute for people on the UFC performances too. And uh, they have trainers and Dietitian nutrition, right? So I'm going there to meet with them to get a guideline and some kind of plan that we can attack so I can go down. I look, I met with your guys, they said it's okay while on their second day into all this like crazy testing you do, right. They have all kinds of tests that they run where you get on these bikes. And I mean like, fuck, I was the Olympic training center testing.

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       Um, uh, I wanted to say Joe Silva walked in, but then that's not right because he's not there anymore. So, uh, Maynard, no, Sean Shelby comes in and says, [inaudible] my prayer really wants to fight you. You want to take this fight? And I was at, uh, well, I thought it was going to 55. And he said, yeah, he called you out and really wants to fight you. And I was like, well, fuck. Okay. I'll finance. Sure. Done. That's fine. But next door, can I go to Vinny via, you know, like God damn. So how does Perry thing I'll start. It was, um, Felder's opponent got hurt. Um, I called the fight gay. She goes, because Vic got hurt. So I was like, I'll go to 55 by [inaudible]. Um, crazy shit just happened. And then the parry fight, they offered me and I called Perry, said, hey man, I know we're trying together, but this is 10 days notice.

Speaker 1:          00:02:24       Let's do this. He's like, fuck him. That'd be great. Let's do this. So that's how that started. And then I didn't get the fight. That was the end of it for me. I wanted to use to go back to one to 55 and then all of a sudden he's calling me out and fell the winds of fighting. Perry, you were going to fight barrier where you were at least thinking about it? I was like in the mix. Right. But I couldn't, I didn't get cleared because I had stitches. Could I just fought a what? I don't know 10 days before. So, um, plus I was in the hospital having my new son, so it was kind of a weird time for everything, but I was wild, wild, wild shit and out now and now I'm fighting Perry. You November 10th, then Denver. Well, what was, what was gonna happen was Jackson and Winkeljohn we're supposed to be here today, right?

Speaker 1:          00:03:08       Well you had, I mean you've been with them for how long man? I want to say before my WC days. So I went on the more than 10 years. Yeah, easily. Yeah, easily. More than 10 years. I, I don't think there's another athlete there that's been the longer besides Diego Sanchez who's been there since the beginning, but he left for a little while for the while came back. Um, so me, you know Holly, but she was with wink before he merged. So, but like with actually Jackson Jackson and I'm like, they're like the one, you know, everyone else kind of either left the jam or retired. So what the fuck happened? Like how did they decide that they were going to corner my Perry? Who by the way, I like a lot. And I have nothing against to say pair either. I don't this, this, this has nothing to do with it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:01       With Perry has a fun dude. I like that guy a lot. No problem with him on the boat. Took them shooting with me and when he was down there part or part of the action, you know a Frank Lester who's helping him with his pads, friend of mine, you know, so he comes out shooting with me. We go out in the boat and have fun and um, so this has nothing to do with them. I just asked when I went to go to 55 and then Perry called me out and wants to fight. Sure, no problem. But I went to talk to Greg and we can say, Hey, this guy is brand new to the gym, right? He's only been here one camp, couple of months. I said, I don't think that it's okay for him to come in and call me out. Like that's not, not not right.

Speaker 1:          00:04:39       So if he is doing that, I don't think we should allow him to, to train here for this fight. If fucking Winkeljohn tells me, yeah, you know, I thought you called him out and Oh, this is a shit ass and lies like to your face. So to me he was like, yeah, sure, no problem. I'll clear it up and we won't have any issues. Um, and then the next day he calls me on the phone and says, you know what? I thought about it. If we don't have periods and I don't get paid and I need to get paid for this fight, and uh, uh, cause you just pay Greg, I don't make any money to the gym, so we're just gonna go with him. And then basically tells me I'm no longer welcome in the gym. And he said the team had a meeting, bullshit. The team didn't have a meeting.

Speaker 1:          00:05:20       I talked to everybody that there was no meeting, there's no habit. So to me it's like the loyalty of week taking over this gym is just, it's just shit, man. It turned into like a puppy mill. It's all, it's all about money now and not the old Jackson. When, when I used to work out, we're just getting into this I guess. Huh? Alright. Start chugging, search, hug and shit. Back when I first moved down here and I went to Greg's, when the tap out guys picked me up and introduced me and all that. Right. But when you're on the tap out show, I remember, Oh yeah. That a reality show that will mask called Greg and gotten me. That's how I got involved with them. Right. I, I left Linda Garcia was fighting Roger Ward two were my best friends, Roger would call it. That was by damn right.

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       Mother fucking Mexican. God Damn, I forgot about that fight. Go to fight pass to bring that up. Um, are still wild is due to other men. So do I man. And um, so he calls me like, come on, I need you to come down for a week. Come for one week. Helped me get ready for Roger. He took the fight on my three weeks notice something outlandish. You just like me and Leonard Do. Right. So I go down there. I literally never left. When I went down, first day I walked in the Jacksons in Rashad, Keith Saint-pierre, Joe Daddy's Stevenson. Uh, I mean the list goes on and on and on. And I was like, wow, this is what a real gym is like. This is what, and they all accepted me. It was like a duck. I was like in the family, right? I call, I owned a house in Denver.

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       I called my grandma. I said, I'm never coming home. I'm staying here, sell the house. Right. And I literally never went home. She would just slowly come down to visit me and bring me truckloads of shit. Right? Literally, I lived in a closet, man, fuck it. A third as big as this room, we had a bunk bed, me and Leonard and a, if one person who was standing up, the other person had to be in the bed. That's how small this room was. Wow. And I lived there for two years above, above Jackson's. And we train every day with him. And like I said, I never left. And Greg asked me, he sat me down after about, I don't know, a couple of weeks of being there. He said, man, I want you to be my 50 fiver. And at that time he had the list of 55 hours were nuts that he had and I was like, wow, fuck Greg Jackson, who at the time was the man man, right that the gym was kind of 90% winning.

Speaker 1:          00:07:43       Great. And he just, he's such a knowledgeable, awesome dude man. And to see where the gym was to where the gym is now is, it's like heartbreaking to me to be honest. And I, and you want to talk about loyalty, which is the biggest thing in this conversation that we're having right now is how they pick someone over me through being loyal. I stuck by Greg. Even when the gym started going down, when Winkeljohn merged over, all of the big pros left. It turned into like a puppy mill. You know, it wasn't for, for back when Greg had it and it was its own school. You couldn't turn up to a pro class. Like, like some guy couldn't just come here and knock on your door. Like you say you get Weirdos hero time. Next thing you know he has shin pads on and sparring, there's litter, be at the new gym, bumps come in off the street, I swear to God and we'll fight these and we'll come in and put stuff on a fight.

Speaker 1:          00:08:33       That's a true story. Random bums off the street and uh, that would never happen back in the day. So Greg doesn't run it anymore? No, he has. He's like, so out of the loop Winkle John runs the entire thing and that's what, what is Greg doing? He kind of stepped back for a couple of years, man. Like kind of started doing other things and just kind of got burned out I guess, which is why I created the BMF ranch. I needed somewhere to go and something to do. So I created my list, which is wings argument with me right now saying you built your own place, you don't ever come here bubba. I said, why don't I ever come here? Because usually the people you let in here is outlandish. Like anybody, you pay $150 you can get on the masters and spar with Holly Holmes. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:09:15       That's, that's what it's come to down there. And back in the day it was like private and just us and good pros. Everyone there for the same mission, trying to, trying to get better, you know? But I've talked to some other people that are, I don't want to name sure they've said that when they go down, their new guys will come in and is literally a fight is a fight. It's a, there's no, there's no, there's no a, B, c class anymore. It's like literally these guys come in, they want to make a name on it. He was sometimes when you're towards the end of a fight camp, you don't need those new guy. You don't need that crazy sparring. Right. Right. You need, you need the guys you trust and not some random guy, I don't know. Right. So it's just, it's Asinine me, man.

Speaker 1:          00:09:53       What, what? They turn that place into that. That still happens and I'm a man because you're never going to find that in boxing. And boxing. All sparring is control, control, bringing the sparring partners, you know who you're working with. So I mean we've talked loyalty again to me with Greg, his name is on that building. It's not, it's Wink Jackson wink, right? Jackson fucking wink your names first. Even when it came time to, to pick a decision and they said, we want to go with Perry. Why the fuck didn't you stand? Because Greg still with me. He's like, yeah, I'll just come to the ranch and we'll sort this out. And I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about? You tell me I can't come into the Jackson wink gym, but you're going to backdoor and come to my fucking house and we're going to train to fight me while Perry's there at the gym.

Speaker 1:          00:10:38       You see everything he does and then you're going to come and you're going to train me. Not to mention you're holding classes there and he's watching me. You might not be training him to beat me, but there's a lot of people there that have trained with me for fucking years. So, to me, that was the point. I was saying like, man, can we just not have him there for this camp? I mean, there's a lot of secrets that I, that like inner secrets that I have, like, Yo, I'm, I'm fucking scared to death to fight. Like that's not to say he can, they can tell him like, or they tell them, you know, go get cowboy mad. You know, he doesn't fight well when he's pissed off. So fucking pissed him off, poke out and poked the bear, piss him off, get him out of his element, give him the, you know, the shit like this.

Speaker 1:          00:11:15       Right. So, and there's a lot of other things, small, dumb things that I do and tendencies I've seen over over the year or 10. Yeah. Right. Um, to me that's, it's very intimate. The relationship between a coach and a fighter is, is very, very intense. So for someone to violate that in that way, and, you know, I don't think there's anything wrong with guys from a camp deciding to fight each other and you've got to work that out. But for them to tell you that you can't Carlos Condit, I agree with you that we'll figure it out. Right? Call us. You go that way. We'll, right. These are your times. Your hours affect each other. Right. Friends trading partners who just came in, I said I got nothing against Perry. He's, he's looking for, he wants a home, right? He's looking, he felt like Jackson does.

Speaker 1:          00:11:59       He's great. I like that. Go Up to him. I mean, what is he going to do? Right. And, and I just said, hey, frank was going to go and train with him wherever I heard stories. He was looking to go to Vegas anyway. I don't have any idea, man. I was just, I was just like, man, can we just not do it for this fight? And then Winkeljohn called me on the phone, didn't you have the fucking balls or the backbone to say it to my fucking face? And I was right there with them, called him on the phone. Like, Oh yeah, we're actually going to, oh, go with Perry. You know he pays money. That's again, it comes back to the money. I'm like, so Perry pays him a percentage and you don't pay Greg for my entire career I've ever been there because I don't like Winkeljohn style and like his way he holds meds.

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       I don't like the way he trains people different about what he does. It's the same thing for rep, for you. For me, for John Sam, they're all the exalted. It's the cookie cutter. Everything's exactly the same and it never changes. It's, I don't understand how you can be a coach of the one of the greatest at one time, the greatest Jim's on the planet, you know, and then don't ever revolve, don't ever change and don't run class and it, to me it's, he just drove that place into the ground, man. Turn, literally turn it into a puppy mill. It's only about making money and for you guys at all, I'm talking about a pug mill when someone has a dog and they just fucking breed it and sell puppies and breed it and sell the puppies that that's what's happening. The infrastructure of this gym. Now let's talk about training there.

Speaker 1:          00:13:25       Let's talk about coaching, right? Greg's supposed to be the, the, the general right. I'm just a soldier. How come I have to be now a general anesthesia? It's fucking up in my, in my career. I can't, I need somebody to tell me what to do. Tell me what not to do. And I had to start my own school at the ranch, bringing my own coaches. But then now I'm making all the executive decisions when we're training, what we're training, what we're doing. And I'm not, I'm no longer just a soldier. I'm having to fucking run this whole thing. Um, that's not mapping for fighters. The problem for me too, I liked it. I'm a fucking super alpha male and I like to communicate with my coaches and get everything done in the guys that have a fucking stand and by me and I love him to death, but I need someone to be like, you know what?

Speaker 1:          00:14:07       You crazy fucking bastard. You're going too hard going to do office taper off. It's pumped. The brakes. Oh, let's pick it up. Right. The fucking fun fuck off. Part of your life is taking over into your training. Can we step it up a little bit? Right. I need that. I need, I need fucking direction. I need today we're working on this, not just me going in there saying, ah, let's fucking wrestling today. Right? So, um, you know what to do, but it's also nice for someone else who knows what to do, who's completely objective is. Then on the outside, because there's been, I'm in this so long, there's bright, like I could literally Joe never spar from now til the Perry fight and probably not even do one Jujitsu role. And I would be okay to fight like mentally, but that's probably not a fair idea.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       Right? Like you at your optimum. Exactly. Um, so it's just, it's fucking Asinine to me and the coaches down there. So not only can somebody just ring the doorbell and show up and train, pay the money. You pay the $25 a drop in, or you paid 159 a month. Come to any class you want. But if you're a coach, you can just coach the class. It's that. It's that Asinine. Do I see a new striking coach or new wrestling coach or new Jujitsu guy in there twice a week probably, and they're coaching the class. Our rest main wrestling coach of Jackson wink, the greatest school in the fucking world is a reception to a chiropractic upstairs. He's great as credentials. Whereas he was a junior assistant coach at a college, don't know the college name, who got fired for selling the kid steroids. That's our wrestling coach.

Speaker 1:          00:15:42       I had one of the greatest schools in the world is a good coach and it was terrible. He's fucking God awful, terrible. He watches videos on Youtube and tries to teach people things that don't even fucking work. It's Asinine, which is another thing that I had to hire my own coach and bring them in. You know, it's like, it's like, Whoa, wait, what? And now they don't even drill. They just go live and they want to know why people get hurt every day. It's like you can't just go in and say, okay, and we're wrestling go. So do you think that people just get burnt out on doing things the right way and they just, they just figure, look, I'm just going to do this the way that makes the most money? Well, I think, and I wish I had, I had the answer for that.

Speaker 1:          00:16:20       I do because I'm not in that position to, I'm not running a gym and that's, I've never done that because I don't want it. Me showing up to class every single day would wear me the fuck out. Where's everybody? Everybody's got to. But you should have an infrastructure set in place that takes, especially if you're the greatest at one time, right? If you're winning, percentages are in the eighties and nineties and now they're in the 20s like I don't, I have no clue what our, what our rating record of the gym is. But it's, it's nothing like it used to be. Right. And it's fucking, it's Asinine to me the way you were doing as a, you have the BMF ranch, right? To have everything set up. You bring in all your sparring partners and you would be doing all your training out there. And how would Greg interact? We do their show up down at Jackson's and spar cause they sell, they're still bodies down there.

Speaker 1:          00:17:04       Right. There's still guys would show up now as far. We'd bring all the guys in or Greg would come up, you know, three or four times a week to the ranch and we do as far as your ranch from 50 miles bell. Okay. Good Hour. A solid hour drive into the vast Nolan's of New Mexico. Do you like living out there? I do. I love it. I was fucking love it. So I sold my house. I moved here, I fucking planted roots. Now I could never ever sell my place. I'm stuck in New Mexico. I'm moving back to Colorado. I'm a buyer. You never saw it because I have to sell it to like a crazy cold leaders. If anybody out there listening also operate a cold right now I have the perfect alchemy about, we've got 40 acres, 40 acres, plenty of rooms, buildings, animals in your vicinity.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       Um, oh yeah. This might be where we start. There's, there's about an hour driving and running some elk antelope, um, everywhere. Which is crazy thing about analog. Did you know they don't jump fences, they won't jump fences, right? You can just literally cornered him into a, into a, into a nail. Occasionally jump a fence. They've been known to jump a fence occasionally. It was very, very rare. You know, they evolved before the ice age. They evolve to get away from Cheetahs. Howard, you're so smart. That's what I want to know. I'm not smart. I just remember, dude, it's fucking insane. There was a, a, a mass extinction of a giant land mammals. It's somewhere around 12,000 years ago in North America and before then there was cheetahs. There was actual North American cheetahs. There was a north of back in lion that's bigger than the African lion. How about that shit. Giant ass fucking line and that's where these fucking things did you want another chu? I saw it last time I brought me Kevin, if you got Rogan to fucking take a chill, just take it. I swallowed it. I didn't know what I was doing like a man. All right. Round two. Here we go to, it's a wintergreen Copenhagen under your chin. Under your lip change if you want it take just a little one too. They take a big hub or liver.

Speaker 2:          00:19:23       So there's that. Um, there's turkeys out there. Target, right? I love Turkey. I'm a bird hunting fanatic man. Man. I love birds. How many acres you got? 40 acres. Oh Wow. It's nice. 40 acres and mule but bird's eye look a bird junkie. How'd you find that spot? Um, so when I moved out there and after I was in, um, the gym for like a year and a half of Leonard, I was like, Bro, you're like winning a bunch of UFC fights. Now I'm in the WC. Uh, we're starting to get a little bit of money. Let's get a house together, right? Let's find a house. So I started looking kind of in the remote areas around where I knew I could commute in, but I wanted somewhere I could ride my dirt bike, shoot guns, just be cowboy. And, um, we found that place and I call my grandpa and I said, hey, I think I found a house. And he said, I'll be right there. And he and my grandma drove and he walked to the lady and he handed her an envelope full of cash and he said, well take it just like that. Wow. Yeah. It was probably 60 or 70,000 less than they're asking, but he had real cash, real cash and said, we'll take it. One grandson wants it and um, we'll take it.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       Wow. And I was like, oh, I was just showing like, okay, uh, thanks grandma. Right. Like we just bought me a house and um, he liked, believes in me no matter what I did. I used to be on, on magician. I used to like love my magic, right. So He'd always behind me magic shit and sit there and watch me do it. And he was such a fucking cool dude, man. He used to do magic. [inaudible] did you ever do shows? No, no, no. I mean I was like 12, 13. I would do shows to my grandma, Grandpa, and my friends and I still have like a toolbox full of magic stuff. I should busted out and bring it out here one time. And there's some cool, yeah, I'm not like good, like you wouldn't be like, Whoa, Doug blue one. But there's some, some of that slide of hand stuff. It's pretty fun. And like the coin coin magic is good. And how do you keep the shift from going in your mouth? You just, cause it doesn't for me, it doesn't seem to want to stay put where you keep drinking on top of it. You've got to like very with your tongue and then go over it.

Speaker 1:          00:21:47       Try fucking love it. So yeah. Um, greatest dudes, man taught me a lot, taught me a lot about loyalty, respect man. And, and I called my grandma on my way here today and I said, I'm going to fucking set fire to this bridge to Jackson's. And she wrote me back and said, what you need to like, are you attacking them logically or are you out of anger? Which, which direction are we going here? Powerful grandma right on the ball. What's direction? How are we going? And uh, she said and start bidding soon, Huh? Yeah, you definitely got to spit. She said, make sure you know always in life, don't ever paint yourself into a corner. Like these are major lessons you always do and we don't burn bridges. You can't cross. But she told me today fucking and let it go. Let them have it.

Speaker 1:          00:22:43       They, they, they want to step across the line. They drew the line in the sand, let them want to burn their own, make them just feel so bad. They want to burn their own fucking gym to the route. And you know, it's like, to me having the moment for Greg to say, you know what, wink, my name's on this fucking Jim Cowboy has been with me from the star. There's been times two or three camps ago where I've trained Greg maybe one or two times and I still write him a check. I still write them a check and I pay him because he got me into this motherfucker and loyalty to me. Is that the top, top of the line thing, right? It's top of the line to me too. That's why you're here. Right? That's why they're not. And you know, and it's unfortunate because I would like Greg a lot and I, and I was like, great. I don't know much about Winkeljohn other than his work. Right. What does on with Holly and a lot of other people and uh, I was really torn up about this. That's why I contacted you. Sure, sure. You know, when you told me this is like a crazy scenario all around for everybody across the board, like, wait, what do you like? What, what the fuck you mean, what's happening here? You know, and

Speaker 2:          00:23:47       it's, it's, it's crazy. It's wild. I appreciate you sticking by my side. It was a, it was a situation where I didn't know what to do. Yeah. You know? I was like, I can't just ignore it. I would have to bring it up when they were here and then I wouldn't get a full representation of it. Sure. I mean, do you feel like you had a full revenue, you got to figure out how to do this right? It's a skill. You learn how to Tuck it in your, yeah, that's all over the place. It's in my mouth. My was in a little ball right here. I don't know. Mine is not, uh, is not controlled. I'm going to wind up swollen this again. So if your name's on the, on the thing, like right now you go to put a spit it out.

Speaker 2:          00:24:32       Now you've got to open another beer and wrench it and you got to give it a ranch. I said Reggie, I opened bare rent it out. Spit it out. That way you don't get any more swollen though. You're not sick again. I wasn't sick last time. It was fine. It was weird. I swallowed the whole thing. Um, fuck yeah, I missed you man. I missed Ya. It's been a while. So much has happened. I'm glad we got that kind of out of the way. I'm sure I'll circle back on. I drink a little bit more. I'm sure it's too, it's um, it's unfortunate and I know what it must be like to try to keep the lights on in a big gym and now they have dorms. It's huge. Giant ass place. Huge overhead. I'm sure all of these people coming in, coming out, and then, you know how fighters are not you, but some fighters, they don't give a fuck about loyalty.

Speaker 2:          00:25:18       They just care about themselves. They're on their path. It's a, it's a very solitary single shelf that you're very selfish sport. You kind of have to be right. Yeah. And I think that's Kinda where the team got was very selfish. He has his own gym now. I had to fucking hat too, man, for the better of my family and me. I had to keep evolving. I couldn't spiral down this drain with you guys. Right. You know, now Michelle Waterson just build a new gym. She's doing the same thing in her backyard. Love her to death, you know, not doing it to her. And her husband built a badass little jam. Oh Wow. All sponsored by on it. Fucking really bitching man. It's cool. Yeah. Good for her. Good. Yeah. Michelle Wu. Um, you know, but if you look at the track records, since [inaudible] has taken over the gym, everyone's left.

Speaker 2:          00:26:02       I mean, it's like you don't see a pattern here, wink. Like, maybe you should change something up or just not allow, he's been fighting for a long time. Shannon training for a long time. I mean, he was a bad ass kickboxer before he ever got into training. And you know, I think one of the things that happens with people, they just get this holes, selfishness of the sport. It wears people down to a certain extent. There's comradery, but there's also selfishness and they're all constantly going against each other. Sure. And you know, having a gym like that, the expenses, the overhead, and then, you know, dealing with people that are just grabbing, grabbing, grabbing. It's just, it's got to get overwhelming. And you see a guy like Mike who, you

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       know is a potential big star. He's a colorful kid. He's a knockout artist. He fucking loves to fight. If I was a coach, I'd be like, this is the kind of guy I want in my gym. He's a fucking animal. You know, it's, uh, it's a show. We're excited to fight him because this is the one of those fights where we're going to go in the middle of the ring and we're going to, we're going to fucking fight the old school. Fucking yeah, let's fight. So I'm fucking, I'm pumped on it. I love the kid, you know, he's cool. He's crazy. Him and I would get along. Just going to do so. Uh, I got nothing. Like I said, nothing the ham or Frank Frank is Koetsu. Well that's Perry's working with, with frank, the on striking coach who Frank Lester Lester who was holding, holding the, the infrastructure of the gym together.

Speaker 1:          00:27:33       Almost single handedly. You know, there's a couple of wrestling guys and I'm his Brandon Gibson still random. Brennan had a full time job. He just got promoted again in his government job. He was like a real government job. Job, job, job on top of being a super chocolate. Yeah. How the fuck they do that man, I have no idea. He has like a nine to nine to six job, maybe, maybe seven to six job. Really these every morning up early take care of his family. He's a great dude. I got nothing bad, nothing but love for branding. Gibson, man, nothing that really, him and I just separated only because I need to, I just want a different angle of striking. It wasn't, it would mean we had nothing to do with, he's a bad coach. I lost my fight. I'm firing you. It's just fucking just trying something new, trying something new, that's all.

Speaker 1:          00:28:20       Uh, but yes, gives it to them, but with Gibbs and kind of just works, you know, with John Dodson, with condit Kinda, I mean, he doesn't have the time to go in there and just hold that gym together. So he, um, he has a real job and he just got another promotion. So he's like the top of the, he started off as a lifeguard, worked his way all live in the city. Now he's damn near governor. I think that's next governor is next for getting that hard. I had Gary Johnson in here. I think I can be governor of New Mexico. No, no offense, Gary. Well, let's legalize pot and a mushroom. Is it not legal there? It's, it's recreation or I mean it's um, medical diamonds. Yeah. One of those places. This is a lot of places we got of AIDS like that. That's how it used to be a lot of places.

Speaker 1:          00:29:05       But like Vegas used to be like that and now big, this is Lucy goose open wide. Vegas got full on dispensary's man fucking Vegas Man. Vegas is definitely a two night town man. Yeah, it's rough on the liver. It's rough on everything. It just takes you, it takes you the fuck in man. Yeah. I was just there last night. I was out there for a big monster conference and it's just like you, you sit in your room, you're like, well I could just go down and a gamble I guess. And then you start gambling. Have you ever played backer rod? I don't put shit. I have never either. And I decided, we tried backer rod like double oh seven. I was like, we'll be like double o seven. We'll go in there. I played with,

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       with one of the higher ups in monster and he took us down and we played this game and uh, fuck, we want a shit load of money. A shitload of money. There was like five trek. Yeah. Yeah. I'll take some of that. I'm really smoke much pot, but I know just talking with you, that stuff was that they grew up out on the moon. I saw a video of him, breakdancing, it, any breakdowns. What I do, I used to, I used to really break down. So I had the Mazda conference. We lose a Blackstone. I met the monster conference and um, monster now has a break dancing team. Yes. Monster got me some bags. Bags, man. A good dude, man. He's a great dude. Yeah. He uh, he takes care of, he takes care a lot of people and the infrastructure of monster. Great. Right. Great instructor. Monster. Yeah. So the ambassador Hauns takes care of it. Take care of people. Right. So, uh, I seen the are going to tell you, I seen the moms, your babies laying back there fucking, I just got them. Um, Gustin Bolanos it was his idea. So the more that you're gonna get crazy. Okay, let's start talking about space soon.

Speaker 2:          00:30:46       Doing drugs. A Joe, it's not nature nature, man. I'm with Ya. Um, so the break dancers, they start break dancing and then halfway through their show they stop it. Oh yeah. So they set up a battle between me and this other guy. Right. And he's had to go out here and we have to break dance. I used to break dance back in years ago, but on a slippery floor with cowboy boots and I did that properly stretch. Yeah. That's good. Oh, so fun man. I it boots Mazda shirt getting down, doing a little breakdowns and it was so fun, man.

Speaker 2:          00:31:28       Dude, we have a bunch of guys from 10th planet that started out as breakdancing. Uh, Geo Martinez, one handed push up with your foe, one handed hand stand with your feet up in the end, twist them around. That's crazy control of your body. It was, it's like yoga on steroids. It's so hard. It's so hard as it's even harder to do. After 12 years of never even doing it again and go with cowboy boots all go. Here we go. We had a bus of these guys come in and uh, Eddie called me up and he gets crazy. He goes by dancing like dancing. Dancing is to think. It's the thing. These guys are so fucking strong, I can even control them. Break Dancers, man. These guys are like 140 pounds and they're like, it's like holding onto a live wire. Yeah, there's, they're so strong. And what does that guy's name?

Speaker 2:          00:32:21       Bboy pocket Kim is that his name is, what is his name? I put him on my Instagram way back in the day. This is Korean kid. That is, it doesn't even seem like a human can do what he does. That's how I felt yesterday when this has been dancing. I was like, Hey, spins all on one hand he's on one hand hopping up and down in the air and spin it around and you're like, pocket Kim. Yeah. Watch this motherfucker. This guy is such a beast. It's crazy to walk. There's a bunch of these guys now they're con there's, there's a stance elements. Yeah. What could this motherfucker look at? This mother fucker. I mean what the fuck is he doing? It's called air tracks. Right? Is Quick on air tracks and he's laying right there. That's that. It's crazy. Yeah. It's like flaring in the air that that is damn near impossible to do.

Speaker 2:          00:33:08       That guy is three cause their trick of all freaks. It's crazy what he could do and there's a few of those guys. If you go to that stance elements, click on that stance elements. Jamie, the these guys are, there's, I didn't know about this until a Tim Ferriss put it on his Instagram. He put pocket Kim on and then I went and watched these guys. These guys are doing just insane physical acrobatics along with music, but I feel like the kids now are doing insane. Everything. Snowboarding, dirt, biking Jitsu, everything. Everything is on a whole nother level playing field, right? Yeah. They're dead. MMA fighters. These young guys that are coming in are, are not just solely one one discipline. Right. They have everything there. MMA fighters. You're seeing these new gut like Zup beat is one of my favorite guys to watch Zombie Magomed Sharapov say that five times he's he, he, it's like these new high level guys are coming in and you look at it and be like, oh, okay.

Speaker 2:          00:34:06       We just hit the new evolution. There's a new evolution going on with these young guys coming up. It's fascinating. It will be, but that's to be expected, right? With everything. I guess especially with social media, you get to see these guys, like on Instagram you get to see the moves at that guy's doing and all these other break dancers get to see it. They would have to see it live rather seeing it in Korea, they're seeing an in Japan, they didn't have to travel and they're seeing these moves and you slowed down. We watch it and learn, learn. Right. Crazy time and not only, not only do we get to watch, but we also get the shit ass guide in his basement. They get to talk shit about that. You have is a little bit of that a lot. There's a lot of it that can't pay attention to that cow.

Speaker 2:          00:34:44       I it, it burns my soul too. Good to pay attention to that. I hate, I wish I was too good to say that, but I get, it's just like if I was coming here and someone out in the parking lot said something to me, I said, what the fuck? Who the fuck you talking to you like that? You know, like we'd have a, it'd be a moment there. Yeah. Oh yeah. For sure. That's how I still feel today. But um, well that's why your cowboy. Yeah. That's why you are who you are. To help you a little bit of this. Yes. The new mood, new MOU that the super new, super new, super new mood case of it. A real new moon. That's it. That's a gift from me to you. I'm talking more about your, um, your, your buddy Paul Paul Stamets. I'll stand, miss enlight fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:35:22       Okay, let's, let's back this up. Let's back it all to take this, take this train back. Yeah, just a little bit. Okay. So you speaking about DMT. Okay. Let me look back up. One more. One more beep. I've never done any drugs in my entire life. Did a lot of drugs are here already. I know we're back up. Remember, we're backed up. I've never done any drug, ever. Never, ever use this. Two years ago. Oh, you did lose the one that's the best legal. Oh, legal law. Um, you're a product of drugs and products of drugs. Cherry. This is not a pharmacy. Fantastic truck. It's made for great jokes. Fun Times, right? How many fucking people had because of Budweiser, Budweiser. So good drug. Well regulated. You know, you know what one bottle does? That's why I like, you know, one bottle does, makes you want it to, right?

Speaker 2:          00:36:20       But that's you. That's on you man. One bottom. You have some Goddamn self control. One bottle. You know what a bottle of Budweiser does. It's really clear true. It's like you eat a fucking pot Brownie who, it could be anything you know, you could be, who knows the fuck you're getting to get that limit. And you tell everything is 3.2% poor people in Utah, you know they're rebranding, rebranding. I found out this last night, they don't call Mormons anymore. Erik Griffin was telling me, calling the Mormon Mormon. It's like calling a small person a midget. Yup. What do you call it? A latter day saints. Shout out to the latter day saints. Magic underwear. Magic underwear. So no drought. Okay. No drugs talk. You hear you're talking about DMG. Everyone's on is DMT ride just sponsored by this little company called on it, which is now fucking huge company, which I love by the way.

Speaker 2:          00:37:11       The gut health. Oh yeah. Probiotics mess. My favorite. You eat Kimchi or anything like that? Do you ever eat? No. You should. You should get it. Get involved. Get getting involved with some probiotics, you know, um, uh, Kiefer's really good. Kim. Choose really good. Now your people are in Buckeye. You're talking about your diet again. Ah Man. It's good to, it's good. People need to know like, you gotta take care of your internal, you know, you don't see that gut health man, but it affects your depression, your mood. The way your brain works, where your immune system functions got helps everything. Those little Onnit packets are key. Man, I don't, I don't travel without those pitches. I don't go a day without them. I ate on my or new pack and they got a new package for them. Now they're not in the same old box. More high tech.

Speaker 2:          00:37:51       Cool. They exist on the substrate that's in those capsules. That's one of the ways, the ways you don't have to refrigerate it so good for travel because it's just, I think you should have a variety of probiotics, but I think it's one of the most critical things that people don't think about anyway. Anyway, drugs, drugs, drugs. Aubrey said, hey, why don't you come out? We got a little group, people doing some DMT. Did he do the whole ceremony? She loves music. Chanced. Erica rose every the whole thing. We smoked tobacco out by the fire. I'm going play some of that acre. Rose, you're talking about talking about what direction we wanted this to go. You know what? What we wanted the journey to consist of, I call them my

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       best friends up. Take them with me and we'd go out there and we fucking, we do this, we sit in this room and we go through the chance in the ceremony and I'm scared it because I've never done anything right. Scared, scared, never done anything. I wish that's it.

Speaker 3:          00:38:56       Waking, waking up the spirits. You just have that last year. It's on. Oh Dude, this is just gonna make me trip. So if I listened to this, if I eat a pot Brownie, listen to this and getting the tank, I'll start trippin

Speaker 4:          00:39:13       all right.

Speaker 3:          00:39:16       It's because when you do DMT and you're, you hear this stage dance for you, right? So the, the experience, you realize what this is. This is like a technology to maximize DMT. And while while you're on this GMT, this is playing in the background, trying to drum and chance and yeah, that's right. That's what's going on. I was in a super smoothly, my camera room I guess, but it was rather a nice,

Speaker 4:          00:39:46       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:39:46       He knows what the fuck is. Know what the fuck he's doing. The real way. You'd be a beautiful man, really spiritual in the room. He might be a beautiful man, beautiful body, and it looks like he's running a sex cult. But what he really is doing is doing it the right way to say it looks like the gentleman Lee doing it the right way. I can maybe sell the ranch to Aubrey and sex called RB and I are partners. We'll talk after this podcast. So I just need to know what kind of zone and you have and whether or not you have water on the property. Go. I have why you gotta well wow. Two wells actually.

Speaker 3:          00:40:26       So what happened? All right, so this music plan and they load the pie, which to me looked like pink cocaine, right? Like pink guts. And they load it and this pipe and he says, just light it and you want to breathe fresh air out of the corner of your mouth as you're taking this harsh smoke. It smells like burning plastic. It's harsh. It's just hit it, do you can't anymore. I'm like, what the fuck does that mean? I try going to hit this rubber, hit it, I hit it. And then all of a sudden I say, oh, you hit it until you can't anymore. And he starts getting wavy and then I just the pipe balls out house and I fall back. The entire world comes back zooming in and be like black and I shoot do this fucking kaleidoscope of colors, maybe 10 seconds and blow out the top like superman out of the top of this tube of colors, it's total black darkness and I'm looking at myself from my the third person.

Speaker 3:          00:41:25       I'm just hovering in midair and everywhere that I've ever been injured or hurt it glowing, bright like super white, like the whitest white fire I've ever seen. Like my head's on fire arms is this or like something out of a fucking movie. I'm just suspended in the air burning and I keep asking myself questions and then I don't know if it's me, but I answered her back to myself. Right. I'm bugging the fuck up because you could still hear this music going. I can hear the people giggling next to me, I can hear the next guy lighting the lighter and he's now going and meanwhile I'm is burning and I'm talking to myself about whatever question I answered right. And then all of a sudden, just as fast as I came in, I kind of eyes woken. I woke up and I still see the rest of the guys in the room cause they like systematically go around the room and an order they're in, they're in there and she hits.

Speaker 3:          00:42:27       Now the pipe comes around again and now it's my turn again. Now I'm really excited. I almost wish halfway through the trip you could fucking hit it again and go back in. So I hate, and this time I'm thinking, yeah, I want to go back to that again. I want to go back to where I just was. So I fucking hate the pipe. Hit the pipe, hit the pipe. Now I hit the pipe. So God damn hard not hold my breath. I fall over to the side, I flied out ball to my left side and I've tipped over. Well, I sit back up because you're still there, right? You're not like in another dimension. You're not out of your body experience. So I sit back up for the entire trip now is sideways and I'm looking at my, this trip, I'm looking at it crazy black rainbows and I can explain what a fuck a black rainbow looks like, but they're waving with sparkles and black into a keyhole that's turned sideways and through a key hole, a crazy light shapes and darts. And every time I almost get to this key hole, it just sucks back more something. I've got to move that joy and I crawled through it again. I tried to get to the key hole and he sucked back again and there was no words spoken. This one is me just trying to get to this sideways keyhole and I just get my hand to crawl through it and they would fucking take off again and I woke up and that was

Speaker 2:          00:43:52       who's my DMT experience. You've only done it once? I'm only not at one time. I want to do it again. Yeah, you need to do, yeah, just marijuana. Okay. Done the Doug about marijuana being a gateway drug. Um, no. DMT is a gateway drug for me. What's the gateway drug to it allows you to do other drugs and now I do a lot of mushrooms. Well, it's one of those things where it lets you know that all your ideas about what drugs are, are out the window, right? All your ideas are all your ideas about what reality is, are out the window because you didn't think that this was a part of reality. How could anybody ever think it before you experienced it? But what I don't

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       get as things that shit shapes and colors that I couldn't almost, that you don't see today where I could see him there and I could have exploded like the shapes in the movements. It was just so weird. Like you're right. Like reality is like what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          00:44:48       How has that reality? And it seems more vivid than reality, more

Speaker 5:          00:44:52       vivid.

Speaker 1:          00:44:54       But the chord that I'm going to tell people are listening. Like you can just open your eyes, right? I mean, you would be real hazy and kind of gone, but I can hold my eyes. I could see the candles burning over there. I could hear her lighters going and then you're like, oh, I'm, I'm okay. I'm not in another dimension. You're going to get stuck in this crazy world. And then how to close my eyes and not go back into it. And Yeah. I mean it's like the most of the realist dream you've ever seen, right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:45:22       There's another one called five Meo DMT five methoxy DMT. And it's a, is that the only room tonight does a different way. The dial, that one makes people really scared. That's a different one because you see you cease to exist on that one. Right. It's more powerful, actually. More, more potent. Yeah. Which is crazy to think there's something more potent and Dmt, but it's more psychoactive in some ways. And it's a, it's one of those weird ones that doesn't have visuals either, but you just go to, you go to everything, you go to heaven, you become a part of it all. It's crazy how clear.

Speaker 5:          00:45:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:57       And since you could make of the uncensored, right? Like I try to explain now on it, it sounds weird, but when I was in it,

Speaker 2:          00:46:05       everything's so clear. Yeah. Well you realize how much of what's holding you back in this life is like insecurity and fear and, and, and it just, it just not knowing, you know, and, and confusion and all this and then it just sort of like pours water on the stuff that's dirty and clean out all the bullshit out and goes no, it's all love, happiness, friends, experiences, live, camaraderie. Those are the important things. That's that you have a party, you have a chance in this life to spread more of that and help other people spread more than keep this ball rolling. And that could really change the world, the change the world because the people that you impact ripple out and they, they impact other people. Or You could just get caught up in arguing with people online. You know, you can get caught up, get caught up in the water over the dirt and just the chaos of it all.

Speaker 2:          00:46:54       It doesn't take much to get me caught up. So what, that's also why you're a great fighter. You know, those things go hand in hand. If you're a person just accepted bullshit. Maybe you wouldn't be the guy that gets up in the morning when you don't want to give. You wouldn't be the guy that takes those fights on short notice. He goes, fuck it. Maybe you'd be the guy that would be like, you know what? This is not the right move for my career. I have to sit back, have to, you're not a, you're a, you're a wild man. And that's why people love you. But that's also, that needs to be kind of, it seems to be appreciated, but also managed, right? Like the chaos of your personality and how you approach things. I mean, you almost fucking died in the caves, bro. This is what you do.

Speaker 2:          00:47:32       That's my other drug. Adrenaline. Yeah. You got adrenaline. It, uh, the things that people were scared of, you flock to, it's like you want to prove that you're not scared of him. And I am. I'm just as scared as you are. Sure. I skydiving. I love it because it's like, Ooh. Yeah. And we go, yeah, there's no, there's no if, ands or buts. And you jump out of a fucking plane. I'm flying planes now. Get my pilot's license. I'm putting, I've, I started a little while back. I quit for a while, but now I'm back. I'm all in. I'm flying and I'm loving it, man. I'm just telling you. I watch that Leonard Skinner documentary last night. Don't, don't fly. Shit he played. That's how we lost lives. Skinner. They didn't need it to get their fucking plane fixed. Trout fuck is true fucking pill heads, man.

Speaker 2:          00:48:21       Two years I come back, I'll be flying. I'll fly up. Fly out here. Yeah man. So, so wild man. So that's a bold movement. I learned how to fly. I mean, that's the ultimate right. Drinking beer with you. But it is easy to brother little campfire where you fucking said we're slicing dear. You should definitely do that. One of these days. You should come to us till the night with us. Okay. You would love it, man. It's the craziest hunting ever, and it's like one of the most ethical, you have to kill him. 30,000 deer on this one island. No, 20,000 deer and 3000 less touch that little subject for a minute about, we now have to kill these animals. Why? Because there's so many people that are like, fuck you hunters. What? Why? Why would you want to take a life? Yeah. Well, the alumni is a different example because it's an island to island filled with deer and there's no wolves and there's no mountain lions.

Speaker 2:          00:49:15       People have to eat them. They're fucking everywhere. Yeah, because if they don't, there's going to throw over populated. Yeah, of course. Yeah. But I mean, I think the, the hunting thing, the anti honey thing is probably real similar to what we're talking about with psychedelic drugs. It's people who haven't experienced it. They don't, they don't know what it really is and they, a lot of them still, I mean, 97% of the people in this country eat meat. I'm one of them. That's a crazy number. When you think about how many people get hated on for hunting. That means for sure some of those people that are hating also eat meat, which is one of the most crazy up ocracy he's ever crazy, right? I mean when you look at it like that. Yeah, with the numbers because they are like, they as they're eating their hamburger on the same breath, there's telling you what a piece of shit you are for killing ducks.

Speaker 2:          00:50:02       Yeah. Yeah. And it's disconnection. You think vegans, if a mosquito lands on them, do they, do they slap it and kill it about that all the time? Do they kill mice that are nibbling in the corner of their house and making noise or they can't sleep? They said a mouse trap house. Good question. Did they shoot the fly with the bad ass new salt fucking shot call of this shit. Me, I'm picking them bitches off. I even met, I open the door, I let him left him in from the horse. Shit come on. And boy that got a little blue black and doing hair flap. So, uh, yeah, they, I mean, just some of them does a mosquito or a fly and not have a soul. I went to an Osram once and uh, the lady had a ant spray out. I was like, what are you doing with that?

Speaker 2:          00:50:48       She's like, oh, we have an ant problem. Here I go, you got an amp problem. Here I go see killed with the spray. That's fucking crazy. This is ash. Rob is a Buddhist Ashram and you are spraying ant spray. You're poisoning deaths from the sky, from the sky. Fucking air warfare on these poor little beings. Cause you don't like that. They get too close to your garbage. Hey, heavy. It's heavy. It's crazy. When you put in perspective like that, they don't have an answer doing wash yourself. What about all those microbiome on your body? You killing all that shit with soap. What are you doing? What are you doing every time you wash your asshole? It's a holocaust killing all this life forms, right? Right. No, no if, ands or buts. Every, I mean it just about her of what La. And the other problem is there's real evidence that somehow or another plants communicate with each other that they have some sort of an, if not awareness, they have some sort of a information exchange between each other and they changed their taste based on whether or not other ones are getting eaten.

Speaker 2:          00:51:53       It activates certain responses in the plants and then they become like really bitter and disgusting to animals so that animals don't eat them. You know, and they do this with like, they can have a recording, they can play recording of caterpillars eating leaves next to a plant and it'll change it's flavor profile and excrete some sort of a chemical. So the same discourages predation there. There's some intelligence evolving, right? Having to, it's like, Ooh, Ooh, we're, we're, we're, we're no longer going to exist if this happens. We have to, we have to evolve with the change, which you talk about us becoming who we are today from super primates to, to write. And I think now we're at cotton, an error where the weak are still allowed to coexist with us.

Speaker 2:          00:52:39       Yeah. This a little bit of that. But yeah, you laugh at that, but it's true. Yeah, it's true. And I just had a baby boy and I can't wait to stand on the sidelines of the soccer games and football games and I can't wait to show up the fucking track day and I'm bringing fucking medals and trophies because my kid is not getting the fucking participation ribbon. He's here to win. Right. When do we draw the line back of of you don't just, just because you are weaker, you get participation ribbon. There's no more competition and no understanding of psychology. You can't protect people from bad feelings like losing those. That's what propels you. That's what makes you better. That's what we're,

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       that's what they're doing. So you're telling you if my kids are awesome, awesome football player and he's on the team running touchdowns, he has to sit the bench because Tommy didn't get enough time to play. And not only that, Tommy, you're his weak ass dad who fucking secret emails the coach behind my back. You know what I mean? Like that shit to me. What the fuck? So I can't, I'm so excited to join this new new journey of parenthood. Parenthood. It's so crazy, man. These kids, and this is not all parents though, you know, some parents realize how stupid it is. There's parents out there just like you. Sure. Just like this is ridiculous. This is a guy that's uh, his, his daughter goes to school with my daughter and uh, I always gravitate towards him because he's got a neck tattoo and immediately I'm like, anybody with a neck tattoo, I'll relate to this because that's a life decision tat you mother fucker.

Speaker 6:          00:54:21       We gonna be all right because we're where I don't have a neck tat, but I know how you're living so I'm with Ya. And with these kids were playing rough and he looked at me, he goes, whatever happened to like getting hurt, whatever happened to like falling down and learn how, oh well it should do that. That hurts. Yeah. Well know. Learn how to fall better now. Learn how to not do that anymore. Well, this, this thing was going to make you slip and scuff your needs. Okay? Yeah. That's part of learning. You can't nerf the world. You can't nerf the fucking world when you nerf the world. And then you empower these people that have lived in a nerve to environment, that's a problem. They'd have an experience, real adversity. And they're mean. One of the reasons why their mean it's cause they're scared.

Speaker 6:          00:54:58       Yeah. A lot of these, these people on social media that are really mean, they're the ones who are the most scared and they're the ones who are the most week for sure. And the fact that they're so vulnerable is what's leading them to lash out and try to hurt other people because they're so easy to hurt and damaged. I mean that's, that's literally the, the results of living in a nerfed world. But these people that you say or so he, how was that satisfying them to disable somebody that it's not, they don't know what to do. They're hurting and they just lash out of, how are they writing an email? Like I'm gonna get this motherfucker sand and they're like, Ooh. And then they see this, what that is gratifying for them. They're like, not even, it seems like it would be because they're just, they're trying to hurt you.

Speaker 6:          00:55:45       They're trying to like get you, but then eventually it comes back and gets them. It's like they have to understand Lebron James isn't doing that. No, no. Winners are out there doing that. This is loser behavior. Like you're lashing out at others who are doing while you're not, unless there's like, if you have a legitimate problem with someone talking about Lebron, like in the NBA, they don't just sit him down because the other player 22 hasn't gotten enough play time. No, no. The fuck I go ahead and score again. Can we with you right here, make some money, right? It's good. It's good in the, we're paying to watch on TV, but

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       when your kids in it, I don't get it man, but I haven't experienced yet. I've only had friends who have fucking so excited to. It's fascinating just to watch them evolve, watched it a little minds grow, watch talking to them. You know, just experiencing life through these new eyes and seeing them learn. It'll be a little fighter. He's a rotten of a bitch. He sleeps with his hands up and this sleeps with his hands up, both hands up. Oh, what are you doing? And he was like, flex is out. And he'll put them back and he flexes his him out. And I'm like, what are you doing man? It's so cool. It's this little jumper and he has to, he has blue frog and this red fish and I don't know what this red fish did. Damn. But that motherfucker would just slide sideways and just look, stank.

Speaker 2:          00:57:04       I'm out for just sit there and stare at him. 20 minutes, no movement, no crime, just slouched over. And he and he core parents of this red, this red fish. And I'm like, what do, what are you doing? And He, you know, and I'll like, and I'll spin and like play with them and then he just finds him again, just has a staring contest with this fucking thing. Hilarious. His practice practicing practice it. And Ah, I think that's, it definitely carries on through the child. It has to write, has to, has to, I mean, there's only, there's things that people learn like, well, why kids? Scared of monsters. Well, you don't have to be careful of predators. Yeah. You know, there's, there's lessons you learn, you see things that are scary. Like why do people have like a fear of snakes? Oh yeah. The barriers is the last one.

Speaker 2:          00:57:47       Oh, we've got a whole shelf. Perfect. Okay. There's boy wants to go down. It's so smooth. They do go down so smooth. Yeah. I think for sure that some of your personnel and it's going to be transferred through your DNA. Do you have life lessons? God, I can't wait man. I'm so excited. Yeah. It's so cool to see. See Him and how early are you gonna start training them right away so it never knows anything else. He, he, not only Joe is he not gonna, he's not gonna know anything else, but we're dirt bike in work, wakeboarding, word fucking scuba dive in. We're every crazy thing I do. He's going to do it and he shouldn't be fucking launch and huge air and you got to get around his other kids and he's just kind of think that's just what you do. Oh, you guys don't do that.

Speaker 2:          00:58:34       Oh, that's out of doing that for five years. He won't know any different. And um, yeah, I'll, I'll definitely train him in wrestling and Jujitsu and kickboxing. Absolutely. Absolutely. And I'm going to be the dad when he goes and eats a kid up at school. I'm like, what? Danger you fucking animal. How can aim is danger. Your son's name is [inaudible]. My name is Donald [inaudible], so his name's Dac. My initials and then son. So he's my son. Dangerous Serone DAX and dangerous. Serone I'm gonna say Gauger what are you doing it here? You can't beat these kids up. And as soon as we get in the hallway, fucking fist bump or whatever you want, boy, let's go. Well, you already have evidence now on video. Got to go. You need to watch

Speaker 6:          00:59:22       this video now. I mean that's if, if, if he's in there, you know, defendant his or doing whatever he has to do, I'm with him. Yeah. Get you some boy. Well going to the world going to be like just 10 years. Yeah. When he's, think about how weird it is from 10 years ago. How, where's it going to a timber and my high school we had beepers. That's right. Beepers. Remember when people had beepers that also could send text messages and like what the fuck you take it too far. And I had a, you can leave a voice message on mine. You could talk about whether you can call us and do it, but yeah, I mean these kids, your kids are, have no idea what it is to pass a note, write or call. Um, uh, Mr um, Mr Rogan, um, how was, I was just wondering if I could talk with Sarah.

Speaker 6:          01:00:12       Would that be cool? It's after nine o'clock. Idiot. Click that after nine o'clock deal. Right. You have to know what time you called. Texted them. Bad precedent picture taken. But I think the picture taken is also taken a lot away from life. Like even me, I get caught in and I'll go to lunch with three of my friends and two minutes into the lunch we're all Instagram who's road and got on the show today. You know? I know it's, it is a problem. You, you lose a lot of your life to these fucking things. A lot of it and it sucks you in. But it's also so awesome because so much is learned. Like you said, it needs to be managed and you and like that's in rice. People you want to talk about. We were just discussing the different kinds of releases on the bow.

Speaker 6:          01:01:01       Right? Well maybe I don't know about you. I literally, two seconds after I leave you, I can youtube it and I can, I can, you know it all, I can know it all. It's crazy. I can have experts on every single release, make Rolland judgment and decide what I want to do. And that's crazy nowadays, you know, and that's, the world is so much better in a sense I think because you can do that. But it takes away a lot of the bullshit people used to have. Do you probably when you were in school and the guy tells you, I'm this, this, this and this. Yeah. There's no buddy goes other than Jimmy saying, Oh yeah, I was there. Yeah. Right. Yeah. He never knew. No. Now you just go ahead like, wait, what? Nah, man. That uh, yeah, that's, that's negative view. You are not a gold medalist and I write, well, you still see some of those guys are still floating around.

Speaker 6:          01:01:56       This is a few of those guys are still floating around that somehow or another made it through the net and then the dark, they came in and the dark net floating around right now, like kind of like skating on the boundaries of incredulity was, yeah. There's a lot of frauds out there. There's still still kind of operating fake black belts. Fake gold medalists fake. Yeah. Why would you want to be a vague black belt? They don't know any better. They just, they just been lying there whole life. Mostly it's like the demons that you experience when you do mushrooms. They got their own demons and you know, maybe it was childhood molestation does people that lie that it's just nature. That's just what they do. They're probably beaten as kids. Their parents were shit. Everybody lied to them. That lie that everybody that had to be that person.

Speaker 6:          01:02:43       Why does, why, why can't it be the rich kid that's born in Beverly Hills that has everything and he lives, he's still alive. He's still my kid. He'd be a p this big of a piece of shit is that. It could be, but I bet a lot of those uh, like real severe lighters, they come from abuse cause they have to like create a false life. But you get a lot of abuse in rich households too. Especially like, even though maybe the dad has to work 16 hours a day as a bank or something like that. He's never home. The mom's on drugs. No one's taking care of the kids. They're hanging around with a bunch of other lost kids and their school and they're all doing drugs together and fucking off and crime and all kinds of shit. Just to be, just to have an excitement in their life because they're so bored and confused and lost and lonely and they start lying to a lot.

Speaker 6:          01:03:24       I mean, all comes from the same place. Whether it comes from a rich kid or a poor kid, it comes from your life being fucked up and you, you're not, you're not liking who you are to eat mushrooms. That'll help and deal with the demons still with the demons and then go do something. Go do something so that you know that you could, you could experience some nerves, you know, and, and you could, you could rise to the occasion, you know what I mean? And learn about yourself. That you could overcome that and you could make mistakes and fail and then try it again and succeed. And then what the, the bad feelings that you get, like when you're worried about losing, you know, and these, these, these fears, it's because winning is so high. Man. I've seen you went so many times. I've called so many of your fights and you know, I look right in your eyes whenever you win.

Speaker 6:          01:04:09       And there's just like, this dude's on fire right now. He was just like, there is no other, I couldn't even explain to you that feeling because no one can, nobody can sign up to do it other than fuck, fuck yeah. Right. That's right. Yeah. That's a feeling. You know what I mean? Like that's, but it's, fuck yeah. At times, like a million. Ooh. You know, you know, and, and God, it's, it's the highest highs man. It's just insane how, how cool it feels. Um, I've seen like with you particularly like Kaos, right? Like there's something about chaos when you just crack someone, then it's over and then you're, you're walking around. I'm like, you'll, you'll like glowing. Well, I feel like I'm in my DMT. Yeah, you did it. You went through all the fucking demons and all the darkness and all the fear and all the insecurity, and then he landed and then it's over. And then it's just as fast as it started to tell her, that's crazy. That's over. And then it's like, hey, four weeks from now, blah, blah, blah. Fell out. Yeah. What are you going to do? Like, we're going to fucking do it again and to start over. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       we're going gonna start a lower and if you realize that and like how, how long are you gonna fight til I'm going to find out. I don't love it anymore Joe. I really am man. That's, I don't have an answer for anybody. Like to go to answer the day that I wake up and I'm like Nah, what we need is medical science to catch up where they get fixed everything 100% right? Like head injuries and bone injuries, everything. Just put people in some sort of microwave machine. Whether it is,

Speaker 2:          01:05:47       I bring it back to 100% thank you sir. So then fighting becomes a matter of temporary injury rather than permanent injury and then it's a whole and then it's a whole nother ball of wax. It's a whole nother ball where everyone's fighting 100% healthy. Yeah. And you also don't have to worry about like your longterm health, which is like one of the big problems with fighting. Yeah. You're like you want to arm bar me and break it. Break to just see the guy who got his motherfucking arm crack the last fight. Um, was it last Friday? Lincoln, Nebraska. I didn't see it. Who got onboard? A guy from Colorado and I watched the crown was such a shit, I don't know his name. He, um, the Brazilian guy took him down arm barred and snapped it home. Not In snap. It popped it and pulled it all in, way back and had it.

Speaker 2:          01:06:34       Then he said, man, I felt it pop, but I told myself winning and losing this and he just kept, kept on all the moments like that, that you could just say a fucking break it because I'm going to use the microwave. Yeah. I'm going ride from here, ambulance to the, to the microwave. 10 minutes. I'm fucking him. Me, that's possible. Someday maybe it's not in our lifetimes, but it's possible someday and fighting is going to be a different thing. Like that was what was so impressive about John. When Victoria got his arm v toward Jesus, he uh,

Speaker 4:          01:07:10       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:07:11       Oh man, this is nasty. This is right. Rate Tabs. The tabs right here. But before? Before,

Speaker 2:          01:07:17       I don't know. I don't know if they got out of the scene. Yeah. Before this. There he is. He has, he puts it behind his back and he has it fucking boat. This guy used to train at Jackson's to the Brazilian guy on the bottom. Hmm. Yeah. When John got tapped by v toward that was so nasty. I mean he was fully hyper extended and it just didn't tie and his arm was fucked up for a while afterward. Right. That's why he had to host the ultimate fighter. Correct. He really couldn't train properly with it. Yeah. That's, that's uh, it's going to be a different animal in the future when people aren't worried as much about permanent damage. Right. I hope I need it because I do a lot of permanent damage. Yeah. The most damaged today's permanent damage. Wild excursions. I go on. Tell me about the cave dive you want to learn about cave diving. Kay.

Speaker 4:          01:08:15       So

Speaker 1:          01:08:17       first of all k dive in is the last certification someone we can get caving right in, in, in diving. Like you started off to get your open water, then you move geared, advanced open water, get your ear nitrox and you start, you start learning the rules of mother nature because mother nature is never going to take a loss. She wins every time. The only bitch I know that wins 100% of the time, right? You cannot, you cannot fuck with her and come out winning. So when she, when she wants to take you, she takes you. So you learn about all these different rules of the water and of the nitrogen levels that you're taking into your body. Um, and the cave diving is about five years. And I, I got my certification in high school and I am a super cave diver. Man. I love it.

Speaker 1:          01:09:04       I love it. I love, I love diving. I love everything about diving. I love ship diving. Um, so no days, caves, you name it. I love it. So we were in Cozumel a couple weeks ago and uh, one of my old, you could almost call him instructor. He's taught me a lot of what I know about diving today. We a dove three or four days with some buddies of mine that were down and goes, Mel just went through, some ships, went through, some k are, uh, like, um, it's the coral reefs just playing around down with them. And then we go and do a, a, a serious diabetes. He's getting a little bit older. His mind is still very, very, very sharp. But his motor skills don't keep up with them much anymore. Right. And in, in a cave diving, it, uh, it's very necessity that you need.

Speaker 1:          01:09:53       So we jumped in this cave. It's rewind to 20 minutes. I had just kissed my girl and my new baby and she's, I don't, I don't really want you to go like, right. I don't, he just, I don't want to say his name, but the guy you're going with, like I'm worried. I said, what are you worried about? I said, I'll come at home. This is what I come home every time coming home. Fuck. I Dunno. I Dunno. So I pick up another, I order another um, cylinder of air just for x. Y I have to, originally I'm going with order another cylinder air. Just, I told her just for, just for, just to fucking have it right. No one's ever died because they have too much hair. He gave diving, you dive in third. So if we have 300 PSI would do a thousand Psi, n would do a thousand psi out and we have a thousand psi in case something fucking happens also in cage dive and they have lines.

Speaker 1:          01:10:53       You run these in a cave. The law already had a line run. A bunch of guys like me, tech divers have gone into caves, discovered them, they mapped them, they named them and they put put lines so you can follow them in case something happens. Right. Get in and get out lines and lines and none of the lines really connect to for like the main lines, we'll have like three or four main lines down, big channels of the cave because caves are huge. Right? From an intro to the main line. Usually no one has a caveat. You have to, you have to make it to what's called a jump. You have to make your own own line because they just don't want someone listening on deer today to go find a cave, jump in, swim down, and be able to get in and out and get lost in there.

Speaker 1:          01:11:32       Now also, we have a Thailand incident. We're looking at one in the city people. So we make a jump tie off. You put these direction arrows down. Um, they're called cookies, right? Pointing out towards the direction out of the cave is that way if something happens, you come out, when you make a jump, you take your light, you wrap it around your neck, and then you have two hands that work on the line. The Guy I was with didn't follow some of our rules. And in cave diving, it's kind of an unwritten fact that you only worry about you. I'm coming home, right? I'm fucking staying alive. So Joe, you mean and I were Dave diamond, if something were to happen, I'm not going in there to get you. No reason for two of us die and only ones in there can die.

Speaker 1:          01:12:21       So he tries to tie off his buoyancy. Fucking he hits the roof of the cave, kicks his feet, spins analysis on this line that's supposed to be tied off, which is our fucking lifeline is now wrapped around him. So I swim over to them and I tried to help him unhooked this line and he goes into panic and panic kills everybody involved. Everybody involved dies with panic and that's something that I can't express enough. So he started fucking freaking out, hitting the roof, spinning silk fucking hour. And I just back out, take about four or five big strong steps back when I grab a hold of the main line. Now it's silting out now and I see something silting out. There's all this like sediment, the ends on the bottom of, of these caves and you were like a little tiny room. So if you kick your fin hard, it kicks up like dark dust, mud, sediment, silt.

Speaker 1:          01:13:17       You can't fucking see anything blacks out. So I back out of the silt. I grabbed the line and I see them in their fucking freaking and panicking, spinning and rolling around, getting all caught up in this line. And I'm like, fuck, I just stay calm. This was the exit. I know where it is cause I know where I am. There's the exit. He was making a jump to go down another tunnel. There he is. Now what I just tell you about the rule that someone comes home, right? I broke the rule and I went in to get him. I said fuck it down. So I let go of the line and I go in to get him because his light fucking is off now. And I'm thinking, God damn, he spun up in this line. Is Lights off? Did he drop his ray? You later? Is he had air? Is he okay? Sooner as I go into the sill, fucking lose everything, man. Lose my way. Where I am, my up, my down. I don't know where I am. A fucking panicky now I'm panicking. Fucking freaking out more than any I've ever breathing hard bang. Hit My head on the fucking ceiling and I just close my eyes. I'm like, God dammit. Calla, calm the fuck down. Calm the fuck down. Calm the fuck down. Breathe.

Speaker 7:          01:14:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:14:34       Came. See my hands in front of me. I have two watches on their glowing right. Those are my does let me know my death, my time, everything. Or I have to, to, to dive computers. I check them. I look calm. I checked my light, I gotta turn my light and burn. Burn my, uh, our, um, pressure gauges, their glow in the dark rides. I'm charged with my light and I look at it. Okay. Air Check my second one. Okay. Air. I know my third one's good because I haven't even opened it yet. That's just, just in case I breed down, I fucking think. And I came to see my hands in front of me and to this day I closed my eyes and it gives you nightmares. Write him out. Just thinking about it. Cloudy, dark, can't see anything. All I can see is the home of my light.

Speaker 1:          01:15:12       So I turned my light off. Not trying to think of like, all right, just, just, just calm, calm yourself, figure this out. Where's, where's our partner? I started feeling around and he's nowhere to be found, right? Nowhere to be found. So I'm now, I've calmed myself a little bit and I start feeling the walls and I start moving around. I'm trying to think where am I? But I don't know because we haven't been down this channel yet, so I don't visually haven't made an imprint of, oh there's that. There's this right. Kind of like a mental imprint in my mind. Cause that's what we're doing as you coming in and landmarks. Right. I don't have any of those. I don't have any feel, I don't have any touch. And I'm moving around, moving around. What took accomplish reading of the direction of the front when we tied off of the, at the first jump, right?

Speaker 1:          01:16:00       So I know 126 degrees is the way out, but in a cave they twist and they move and they're up and they're big and they're deep and they're low ride. They, there's no rhyme or reason how the water made the cave. So it's kind of a direction I can think of. The first thing that comes to my mind, I start swinging that way now. I hit a wall, boom, and I go down. I hit a wall and I'm fucking in panic mode again. I fucking swim him now. Just start swimming and kicking a fucking going crazy. I make my way out of the silt and I fucking turned on back on the main line, right? I find the main line to the cave again, which is 800 yards to the front, to the door

Speaker 1:          01:16:42       and grab hold of the main line. I fucking real it. Anyhow. Okay. Now the entire behind me deeper into the cave is free. It's no problem. Silk Free. I can see everything's good. More I need to go is fucking Celdt it out and blown. Gone and completely fucking wash. I can't, I couldn't see you sitting there, but I can see everything behind us. Sure. We can't see you have the main line, but I don't have the jump line to get the fuck out. So I started thinking, I was looking in the cave maps to try and like before we went and just try to get a visualize of, of, of the direction. I'm trying to remember landmarks. I can't see anything. I can't feel it. I'm like, fuck, there was a split up here. So I start, I, uh, go back into, back into the silt again and I start feeling around and I'm feeling and I find a hole and I'm like, is that the right way?

Speaker 1:          01:17:37       Is that the one I want to go down? Where does that one go? Okay, maybe remind me. And I remember, I remember that. That's not okay. Let's go to this next one. I go into the next one and now this is, this is where it's gotta be him going, but all of a sudden I'm swimming against the current. And I remember when I came into this cave, there's this very slow current, which is why the entire case now washed out from that point on, right? The current is taking out. So I'm like, fuck, you're swimming against the current, so you're going the wrong way. I somehow work that into my fucking panic mind. We're, we're swimming into the car, we're swimming in the corner. That's where we're going the wrong way. So I fucking turned swim back. I'm back on the fucking main line again.

Speaker 1:          01:18:15       Right? A find the main lines clear. I out into the clear main line. Fuck, fuck, fuck. I start like hi preventing and, and panicking. And I'm thinking, man, are you fucking you piece of shit? This is how he will die. What the fuck are you right now? And keep remind kissing my wife and kid by kid saying I'm coming home today. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. So I'd do it again and I fucking venture into the fucking great unknown. Fucking a bis. Total blackout, another panic and other panic. Fucking freak out. Can't find a way he had chicken losing air by the fucking second bro. Cause now I'm breathing hard on breeding. Fucking irrational and I'm sucking my tank's dry. Right. Mind you, I'm on air so I don't have, there's no, there's no answer to this. After I breathe my last breath, keep checking anything.

Speaker 1:          01:19:09       Keep keeping my time look in direction. Time, time, air, time, fuck, slowdown, slowdown, slowdown, diamond pitch. Fucking black. Can't see anything. Trying to figure out where I'm at. What I'm thinking. What am I doing? Okay, we're running out of air. How much time do we have? Kalbi we're at 28 feet. I know we're at 28 feet. I could probably read on this for about another hour on this tag. Another hours. We've got another hour. Okay. We've been in here fucking 38 minutes already. How are we going to do start trying to find my way out. I can't. Trying to find a way out. I can't now. I started thinking, what am I going to do? I'm not going to drown Joe drownings like my biggest fear of my life, so everything that that's called a BC and we carried on her bag. It's a buoyancy control device. That's how you, that's how you control your buoyancy when you're scuba diving, right. It probably holds 20 big, huge strong breasts, so I feel that motherfucker up. This is my plane. MOFILM IBC BC up, which throws me to the top of the cave bunk right now I'm only now I've got to flip upside down and have like crawl on the ceiling trying to figure out where the fuck I am, how I'm at. Now I've got to get out of a cave upside down and I'm thinking, all right, we switched to our last bit of air.

Speaker 1:          01:20:32       How are we going to do this, Calvin? What are we going to do? Filled RBC up when I run out of air, I'm now thinking in my mind, how am I going to die, Joe, right? Tell my wife telling my kid I'm not fucking. I'm coming home now. I got to fucking realize how am I going to die? I have a notepad that you carry in your pocket to draw and write on. I'm thinking, what? What? What are you going to say? What's your, what's your letter going to be? You're writing a fucking death later. You're awake. You're a fighter. We figured this out. They will fucking find a way to quit. You fucking bitch. He's the conversation I'm having with myself while I'm in fucking bleed. Panic morning, complete darkness, thinking that there's no, this is how people die. What the fuck are you doing?

Speaker 1:          01:21:13       You're going to write a letter to your fucking kid and tell her how you, how you fucked up. I'm sorry. Daddy's not coming home. So I'm fucking thinking I'm not going to drown. I'm not going to breathe my last breath. So I'm going to breed this BC that just fill up with air and I'm a fucking breathe it until the oxygen level no longer happens and I just pass out. That's, that's my, that's what I've come to realize how I'm going to die. I'm going to fucking just slip away and pass out, keep breathing the same air until

Speaker 1:          01:21:40       I go away and I start thinking, you fucking piece of shit. You're, you're giving up. I think you're having legitimate conversations with myself while fucking complete panic. Like you're, you're going to quit that. You're writing a letter and you're gonna fucking breathe your last air until you pass out you fucking pussy. You're a fighter. Figure the fuck out. So I'm upside down and crawling on the ceiling. And I remember when I came in, we came in the big cave and as like a huge fucking crack that runs along the top turn. Both my watch is off now at this point because they're giving off light and I kill my light and I said that crack gonna fucking lead to the surface. That cracks going to fucking give us something. So I just call start panicking. Me Panicking Lenia again because I'm panicking. I don't know what to do.

Speaker 1:          01:22:25       I'm sucking air and I'm fucking breathing hard and I'm hyperventilating and crying on the sitting, crying on the ceiling looking for this fucking cracking. God Damn it. I found it. I found the crack and I followed the crack and the crack got bigger and all of a sudden I see fucking glow like green glow, crawl and crawl. Cron find it, try to get up. I take her too big. I can't fucking get out of the little hole. Can't get out of the hole. I'm fucking big, big, big, big fucking hitting, screaming, freaking out. Calm down. Kind of like calm down. Kelly, this is the way, calm the fuck down. Reel it in. Reel it in. We're here. We made it. Grab control, follow the cracks and more

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       opens up out. Boom. There's theK fucking I'm out made it. You're coming home. You're talking about. Wow. That was the feeling. Meanwhile, my guys out there, I can't be mad at him because he panicked. He grabbed line, he fucking ran out the hole. He looks at me and he says, um,

Speaker 7:          01:23:34       okay,

Speaker 2:          01:23:36       so we're not diving together ever again, Ali. I said, no, that was it. That was it. And I texted my girl, I love you baby. And uh, they was fucking scary moment, but daddy's coming home.

Speaker 7:          01:23:51       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:23:52       And it was fucking so crazy because that was, I mean, I've almost died numerous times, but almost dying slowly, which puts it in perspective to me like these guys on death row. What? I always thought like, yeah, fucking killer murder or man, that's fuck him dude. Knowing the time and how much time you have left, that's some scary shit, Joe. Knowing that you have two hours left, how much air do you have left? At the end. Maybe another hour, probably an hour and some change.

Speaker 7:          01:24:26       But

Speaker 2:          01:24:27       could you imagine how I had to talk to myself? How I was going to die? Like to me that fuck me up. I fuck me up really bad. Like I probably had to go do some mushrooms and asked myself question questions now because that fucked me up bad. But the inner me, the fighter, the youth do new fare at the fuck out. But was I going to write a letter? I was fucking damn close to write in a letter. It was crazy, man. It was wild. Damn. Hold on. I explained that. Good for everybody who explained it. I'm like a mother. Yeah, I'm nervous. I'm like, I was there. Fuck Dude. That is crazy. Yeah, man. And um, I'm going to do it again now. I'm not scared of it like that. It's just needs to be done better. I'll run my own motherfucking line. Well, it also shows you how important it is.

Speaker 2:          01:25:20       Like what your wife was saying. Yeah. Camp. She, you know, she, she knew something. She had a sense like right when people fuck up a lot or when they're just that person that just can't keep it together. You gotta be real careful around those people. Yeah. Yeah. Fucking crazy shit man. I mean that's what people kill those people in war. Yeah. You know, they just like, look, we can't do this. Yeah, we can't. Everybody killed. Yeah. Your, your, your panic is sure. Yeah, sure. Yeah. You're not hanging in there. You, you become a detriment. Fuck Dude. That is one of the craziest stories I've ever heard in my life. But I'm glad I got to share it with you fucking press. Let's move. I don't know how clean

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       can know. Agree Grandpa, that one man. So as, um, as a tap out guys did for me. I'm starting a new fight series, cowboy fight series, man, amateur and we're traveling all around the country and we're going to be putting shows and I'm going to try and find these new up and comer kids and bring them the ranch. What are you doing it on? I was talking with antler fight pass. I think when we get on UFC fight pass and um, yeah, we're going to have probably eight undercard fights, probably two little guys in that area. And then we're going to a four man tournament for designed weight class. We'll probably go, I don't know, maybe got a 70 or 85 maybe 55 first and the winner of the four man tournament gets to come live with me. Train get brought up. I know everybody, man.

Speaker 1:          01:26:52       I can make a call and get them on all the local promotions, you know what I mean? Get them, build these guys up and try and give back man. And do like with the cow with the tableau guys did for me and just really, I don't know, show show. Great idea. Do you, do you think you're going to transition into promoting or managing or anything or training when you're done? I want to do any training. No. No, I don't think one of mine when I around the corner in life, I ain't looking back Joe, if I, you know, I finally made the corner I looking back, but I'll definitely help these dudes out, man. I'll figure it out with him, her or whatever it may be. You know, I have no desire to train people. People tell me I can teach very well. I just don't agree. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:27:35       Maybe it'd be something that'd be more interesting to you when you're not competing. Right, exactly. You know, but I'm hoping I'm moving into the movies. I want to be a movie star. Yeah. Well that sounds like fun. I just, uh, yeah, I just did equalizer to Denzel Washington was a lot of fun out of small part. I am with the Dash brand x guys and doing a lot of stunts and having fun with that and I'm done. Zelle is great. Yeah. Great Dude. Great Dude. Never met him. Yeah, he, uh, it was cool. It was super cool to me. Super Nice. Um, this fun. Someone welcome, you know, I worked in Blue Jay Heran, you know Jay these in that too. Yeah, he's in that too as a cool, he's, he fight Denzel's an Uber driver in and uh, Jay fights him in a car. It's pretty cool. I'm trying to cells, one of the greatest doctors and several absolutely.

Speaker 1:          01:28:23       I agree with you. I understand you can go over like some of the greatest actors that's ever lived. You've got to have him on that list. Like you got a chance to work with one of the all time greats and he's so cool as a Cadillac got there and he's just, you know, is it weird to be working with them? It kind of was, but he was real. I mean onset watching den Dell and then Denzel on set is kind of different. But he, um, you know, a lot of the, there's Jay. Oh man, that's cool. Right? Um, it was fun man. It was, it was such a learning experience. But anyway, I was here last week and I met with Pete Berg who is a director. He just did that mile 22 and I just got on a new Mark Wahlberg movie, So I, uh, got a small thing on that, but um, he asked me to do the fight choreograph for the whole movie, so.

Speaker 1:          01:29:10       Wow. Yeah. Pumped on it, man. I'm excited working, working, working with the guys. Doing that. So it should be fun to enjoy it. Love it. It's cool. It's just another avenue. Yeah, no, there's something fun to do now. That'd be a good transition for you. You know, so that's Kinda my plan. Um, but last night over again, game Baccarat, I uh, I'm going to be a new race car driver or that happened. My Buddy Ricky Stenhouse junior, he has a dirt track race team. So January, January, it's called the Chili Bowl. Chili Chili Bowl. 300 300 injuries. And you take over five days you raised and you work your way up to enter the Saturday night, the Chili Bowl and you, you, you get down there, there, these are 400 horsepower cars, you know, and error. Excuse me. They weigh 400 pounds, man. I don't know what it is. I don't, I can't doubt like, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:30:01       I don't know anything about way more than 400 pounds right there. 400 horsepower. I, by the way, 900 pounds. Really? Yeah. And we've done dirt track. That's insane. Gives her a video of Chili bowl for 400 horsepower. 900 pounds is insane. Yeah. And they just shit and get and so yeah, that's it. Um, I'm going to January, I'm going to the Chili Bowl and I'm uh, I'm fucking going to give it. Hell. Wow. How Fun. That sounds like a good time. And I said, so is there like a couple warmup days or practice or, yeah, here it is. Things look at this. Whoa. A dirt. Oh my God. That is insane. So he's just going sideways everywhere. Not just drinking. The whole thing is like halfway drifting. Right? It's just so all those people going completely sideways around these corners. That's hilarious. So in January, I, Tulsa, Oklahoma. That's going to be me.

Speaker 1:          01:31:03       Wow. I can't wait. It's gonna be so fun. Wow. Those are good times. And I said, hey man, I want to tell you just because of my ego, right? That I'm a good racer, but I don't really know if I am a freshman race go carts. I have for you. If you want to go down to the local gold cart, chuck, we'll give it hell. But I've ever done that. Never have so excited you got to practice. I said, I said like, is there some warmup or a practice day? And they said, no, you just, you can get a five laps before the race. And I said, that's not enough. No, no. You need a couple of hours, hours, days, couple of weeks, someone to show you like where, where do you in the apex the term, when do I jump on the gas? So what, so fast forward to January, Calvin's going to have five labs to fucking get it. And then I'm on, is there a place you can go practice? I guess you can. Yeah, I have to rent a track. And I was at the monster thing last night, so I was talking with all the, all the right. And they're

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       like, no, we don't practice. We just race. I think we just graced your rates. There's no practice. And I was like, Huh, you don't let you just race. Okay. Uh, so can I pick up one of these car? Y'All got a lot, like a loner I can get in. And they're like, yeah, we got you. And you show up. So Chili bowl has got to like, I guess there's 300 injuries is over five days. You just get after it is Christ. It was all excited. It seems like that would be a skill though. Like going sideways in the dirt like that. You would have to learn how to scale that. I don't have no, they're gonna let you race with pros. Yeah, that seems silly. That seems like jumping into, seems like it's going to Jackson right off the street slapping on some Shin Pads. It's exactly what the fuck's happening. That is so crazy. So yeah. Are you, are you mother buggers and dose all Oklahoma and January charitable cow is coming in hot hot sun energy on me. I get to pick a number. I don't know what number to pick. You get to pick a number and then you'd pick a s a letters behind the number. Wow. I need to, I need a good number followed by BMF cause I definitely need that. Right. What would be a good number for you? I don't know. Would it be the year of your first pro fight?

Speaker 4:          01:33:15       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:33:15       Would it be the year your grandparents bought you the ranch? Who, that's not a bad one. You have to be weighed. What year would that, what's here? Is that I think 2011 11 BMF sounds pretty fun. Learn DNF it. That sounds pretty good. 11 BMF, that sounds pretty good, right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:33:35       Fuck yeah. I'm gonna send you videos. You'll be able to play it and you're like, man, that's not a bad one. Love and BMF is good. Liam. 11 BMF. Hence it's the ranch. Why not have it the birth date of the ranch? Yes. Accurate. You know, there it is. There it is. Probably 311 on this mother fucker. I'm putting in the wall coming sideways around that corner and very little control over the bed. Almost no control. And if you think you want to see me down in the pits and come and take your helmet off and get crazy, she just going down. What other shitty you doing? That's ridiculous. You probably shouldn't be doing mounted, mounted, shooting. I'm out shooting on a horse on a horse. Do you put earmuffs on the horse? Yes, of course. Really? Yeah. Stuff. I'm down in her ears. Wow. What kind of rifle? Shooting Colt 45 oh my God. That's hilarious. Yeah. So here's the rules. You can't have more ammunition than targets are on, on the field, right? So there's 10 targets targets. So we load five shots in each six shooter. Wow. Right? And you show your has to be a gun exchange while riding full speed shooting targets. So you, she one handed while hold it on with the other hand.

Speaker 6:          01:34:58       Yeah, no, no, no. I'm a right handed. So I run the range on my left and I shoot with my right. So here it is right here. This is it. So on hand is where you'd chew on hand offhand is when you put it over over your arm. So this is often cray, this some cowboys and that's it right there. Oh look at this. You run around and shoot balloon. That is hilarious. Right? These people in the stands, it'll let you shoot the fucking talking about people. That data pull is not live. And you mentioned you're just shooting black blanks. Oh yeah. So just the gunpowder is burning the balloons. Isn't that crazy that just the blanks can do that much goddamn lunch. There's a guy in Hollywood when I first came here and like 94 who was on a set and he didn't know that and he thought it'd be funny to put a blanket up to his head and shoot himself the head.

Speaker 6:          01:35:48       Yes. Some people shoot themselves, shoot the horse. I mean you shoot your horse doing and he's probably not going to want to do it anymore. What the fuck? Yeah, they think that it's just a noise. It's not just the noise. So learning, learning and getting your horse training, getting around gunfire and it's fun. It's a good time. That's practicing for some old school revivals. It's called SAS single action shooting society. And uh, once it was fights and during the competitions and during the show is, it's, it's like they, they take it back and they, everyone dresses up and that's hilarious. Those are still to this day, my all time favorite movies, like the unforgiven, C'mon westerns and some of the greatest movies ever, ever. I'm with you. I love him. I love this stuff about them. It's like that's a short period of of a United States history.

Speaker 6:          01:36:35       But that's the period where people were like, fuck it. Let's see, let's see what goes on over here. Let's see the cross, this divide a weak guy. Yeah, he mega diddy. That's one area. If I, if, if there was a time machine that you can go back and see what it was like, if you could only go once and stay there and that was it. It was a one ticket ride. I ain't going, no, no, it's the best time to live ever. They would all want to come here. Of course. Fuck. Would I go back with no Dui, but you'd want to go to 3000 how do you know, hold on. So now you say that, but now how did the guy in six 80 know that 2018 and these guys? Well, they would have to know to know like we know like if we went back to six 18 we're like listen, what you'd go give them a little, here's this is a laptop you opened up.

Speaker 6:          01:37:23       We have a thing called Youtube and get on it. And you just search and that's where we live. So if you want to come there, I'll trade ya. That. They would, they would trade in a heartbeat. But if you like wanted to go to the future where everybody could read everybody's minds and no one had Dixon anymore because we all reproduced through [inaudible], it'd be over orgasm button that's attached to this helmet that you carry around with you cause there's no more oxygen on earth and everybody is free. The new gas. That's way better. Yeah, I dunno man. I think right now it's pretty fucking good. I'm happy with today. I like it. So No, no era you'd go to eh? No. If I could come back, I'd go to like 1492 I think that'd be a good time. So it'd be like when they landed Columbus and I'd be fucking wicked pirate. I think I'd make a good pirate. You definitely make, do a lot of homos though. Let's, no, no one mean they wasn't around with that a lot. A lot of fires are gay. I would be on a boat. The ungay firing, hiring, they're asleep. I mean, yeah, they'd come me and I said, no, this is captain. Don't play it at homie. You're iPad should be sleeping.

Speaker 6:          01:38:35       Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. I would bring the, I mean it makes sense, right? With the scarfs and the crazy earrings, they're all gay. It makes sense in each other. That's what they were doing, man. That's a fact. I'm not making that up. Fair enough. Yeah. I think I'd go back to the gut. The Mongol days, I looked to see gangs con. I like to see just what that would look like when they would take over a city and kill a million people and rape and pillage like yeah, insane. They didn't have any respect for anybody that didn't live in tents. That's how gangster those people, they're like, you live in a house, you fucking bitch. They didn't even treat you like you're a person. I live in a tent with fire. All they live felt tense everywhere. This took them everywhere. Nomadic people.

Speaker 6:          01:39:17       So that would be your one stop. I would like to see what that was like. What did, what do you do? Go back and then if you died you'd come back here. So that'd be like if you weren't going to be a place where I sword. Yeah. Yeah. There'll be a place where you can be pretty assured that you're going to dog gang. Is Open arms welcoming you into the clan? If I came back with it, why don't you be? Yeah, what would you be hot for? Sure. I got some shit to show for Zippo. I'd have to tell him about Dan Carlin's wrath of the con audio series for them. You'd give a fuck so wrong. You give him a phone where there'd be no satellite tower. So it would be, I would have to have some recorded preloaded shit. Huh? Some videos and movies and stuff.

Speaker 6:          01:39:57       And what would you, where would you come in just in case cause here or would you show up in like 2018 thermal optical lens? Like you're like writing riot police with low. If I could bring anything I would for sure be locked and loaded. I want guns strapped to my hips. Knives fucking fully. If you show up with a gun to gang a con, you now become games con she hit right in the Dick. All of a sudden you, he's not worth it because you have fully automatic assault. Write them on the roof. Just started jacking that Predator style, the new sheriff in town, but for sure and then a movie like that. Wasn't that John Claude van Damme time cop? Yeah, I remember that Shit. They went back in time and he had a machine gun. Someone did. They went back at Tom Fuck people up and stole like civil war gold

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       over that. But just like the movies say, I think if you fucked that shit up, you ruin everything you make it. You might be in there just mowing people down with machine gun and then you would just vanish. Be Gone. Mom. What do you manage though? You'd have to write probably or now that you're in this time, uh, do you, are you no longer in our time? Yeah. The timeline changes the, because you're there now and you see this guy's got fucking machine guns. Check this shit out. This is a pretty easy way to make money of this word from booster. I'm from the future faggot there.

Speaker 2:          01:41:34       So that would be you. Meaning gang has gone and would you learn a little bit of his language you think or you just try and go in there with your iPhone and the Internet? I think that the only way you'd be able to communicate with them, we would have to learn this language for sure. That would be a little, how hard would it be to learn? Do they even know how to say Mongo language anymore? I don't think they even understand what the, what the sounds were or think. They're just guessing. I don't think they eat on the side that go back grab one, bring him here. Yeah. You'd have to have them to home teach you. I don't know if they know how those people talk back then. I think there's some real speculation because you'd be so smart and know so much, but you couldn't communicate.

Speaker 2:          01:42:18       Yeah, there's no like, it's not like going to Mexico now where we kind of know a survey. So yeah, we'll like to think that's what the same with the Mayans and that was only a thousand years ago. We don't not, we don't totally know how they were talking. There's a lot of the expectation, there's still translating a lot of those ancient Mayan ruins and there's text and Ken Kuhn, that's where it like to loom. Yeah. When I went into, I went to Chichen it too, which is three miles there once. Fuck. Did you take the tour? Yeah, yeah. We had a professor take us on a tour, so amazing ran. They talk about all the rituals and all the how they drink out of the snow days and then they tell me that how they'd cut their testicles and I was like, wait, what? And they're like, yeah, that's, that's how the the the Sharman or the, the grand master, whatever the head religious guy, I don't know what I'm an idiot when it comes to that.

Speaker 2:          01:43:16       But they knew through their very smart, right. They knew of astrology and he knew when he clips it in what we're coming. So he would wait for the eclipse that come. Knowing, knowing that three minutes later and it's going to just go ahead and pass. But all the people that were with him had no idea. They didn't know, right? They had no idea that it was going to stop. They thought they had done something wrong. The gods are punished them with darkness. So when the darkness comes, he like, cuts himself in, offers his blood to the, to the Gods, moon, Sun comes back, all blood, Balboa, Balboa got some precious blood, precious blood. And, and at that moment I was like, so wait a minute, you were just tricking these people. I've been tricked my whole life. I go to fucking church and I've been tricked my entire life. Like you just tell these people that don't know enough and you knew the real, but you told them it wasn't. Wait a minute, what's going on here?

Speaker 2:          01:44:23       Hmm. I sat back and thought, and I was like, so be it probably had to do what you gotta do to control those people back then. It's Goddamn savages. Yeah. Show him. Show him a little ball. So what about today? We've got it. We got to playing fucking games. Yeah. Condo balls, balls look up control on the sun back covered it with the moon bitch and everyone was like, oh my God, you brought light back. Yeah. Otherwise no everything. And you have a machine gun. You got a machine gun to pitch. But I only have three rounds. So you couldn't, you couldn't get up there and really you going to really, I mean unless you came armed up, but how long would those bullets last? Because there's no way you're making a new bullet. Yeah, everybody has to see it too, cause they're not going to believe you don't have to shoot.

Speaker 2:          01:45:04       Everybody wants you to feel me being gone back to the Mayans. What are the guns I'm playing with today? Look like? Yeah, no kidding, right? You fuck shit up. Talk shut up for thousands of years. That's the thing about guns though. They get a little better over time, but you didn't have a gun from 10 years ago and it's state of the art, I believe. I believe those guys 10 years ago, hundred years ago are built better than the shit ones today. Then the shit ones. Yeah, but they still make real good guns today too. Sure. But that's the thing. The thing is like, it's weird, the technology of guns has sort of in like, like you don't need it. Like with Bose, one of the things about compound bows is people, a lot of people want to know the new models every year because they get better. Sure. But they don't really, guns don't get that much better.

Speaker 2:          01:45:52       Like a gun from 10 years ago is still a bad ass gun. Like I have a bunch of Henry Rifles, right. The Henry rifle from nine from years, it all American made from years ago to the same gun. They say now it's the same gun. Yeah. Yeah. They nailed it. Nailed. Got It. Got It. Yeah. But it's, yeah. So I wonder how much innovation is, how much room for it until we started doing laser shit. Like different, you know, I mean they got it. They got to, they got to ramp. It always drives me crazy about lasers, like a star wars type shit. How come I could see him? How come I could see him? Because there's clearly fogging around. You didn't see him moving too slow. Delights air, they hit. The bullets are so much faster than lasers. You see him to joke, joke, joke, joke. Maybe it's that long of a shot. Maybe their bullet is that long. I think a late, oh, LIGO flying lightsaber. Yeah. Oh, I never thought about that. We're sending big laser beam.

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       Right. Okay. Not other than that he hit you, but it just keeps going. Right. I didn't think about it that way. Like you're shooting like, like crossbow bolts of laser. Yes. Ooh. Burning hot as a laser hot. It's gotta be right as a cold. There are cold lasers. I had, I had a bulging disc once and I went to this therapist. They put cold laser on it. I Dunno, but I liked this idea that she could come back two more times this week and we'll get you in. They just kept doing it wasn't, yeah, I don't think it really works, but, but the cold bursts, I think the laser person, if it was like that, like flying lightsabers. Holy Shit. Yeah, it's at the, I think the bolts were just huge until you let off the trigger. Still too slow. See if you can find like a scene from star wars one with the shooting at each other.

Speaker 6:          01:47:40       Those bitches, it's slower than an arrow. Like they're not moving that fast. Like if you try to watch an arrow coming from a compound bow blogger to follow so you couldn't catch it. Yeah, no chance. No chance, no chance. No 280 feet a second, no cheese and catching shit. But that, those, those bolts from those laser guns look slower than that. And you're probably right. You wouldn't, the new, the new laser, you wouldn't, there's no way you see it. You wouldn't see shit. That's just the magical for a movies and you see it coming. But it just makes me feel like they think I'm an asshole. So when you, when you take this time travel, so if you could go forward or back, you would go back 100% I would too. Yeah, I would too. Well, I'm a human. I don't think there's a good future for humans.

Speaker 6:          01:48:24       I think we're going to be something different. So you think if you shoot forward, you might be the only one in there. Yeah, there might be no more people. Everybody's an engineer in a cage getting probed. Oh, for sure. They're going to test you. I can't believe we found one of these. It's like a Tasmanian Tiger or something like that. Like holy fuck. Lock it up. Look at the video of the last Tasmanian Tiger. Jamie. See if you can find a video of the last Tasmanian Tiger died in a zoo. I want to say in like 1930. What's interesting is they think they're still alive, but Australia is so big. Australia is as big as the United States. There it is. That's a Tasmanian tiger. That was the last bus drives. It's a Marsupial Predator. It's the last um, like real mammal Predator or Marsupial Predator that lived in Australia.

Speaker 6:          01:49:12       That's what it was like. It was like a crazy dog looking thing. But they've found, look at that, the mouth open picture of it. Look at that fucking mouth on that thing. That is crazy. But there are people that are real reasonable people that believe that there's still a few of those that exist in the wild. It's been enough sightings of these things that they think that, uh, what is the actual name of that thing? It's got a crazy name. Cicilline right. How does it spell t, h y, c e. L. I. N. A. Thylacine, whatever it is. That would be us being one of those fucking cage is the last person just wandering around, looking around stupid. All the robots are all, so if you could bring one person, hmm, would you bring a best friend or would you bring a female counter? You've got to bring a check, bro.

Speaker 6:          01:50:01       Goddie right. You got it. Yeah. Yeah. You got it. I'm with Ya. Because you wanna bring your friend like drought. Look, I love, I love to hang out with you, but you know, I don't want to be the last guy in a cane in China without some pussy. No, no, no. Yeah, that would be, yeah, but if I was a pirate then, you know, I guess it wouldn't be okay. What was the gay cowboy movie? What was that movie? Brokeback yeah, we ain't going there. And how we ain't going, man, we are not going there. A little too intense for this fierce that shall not be conquered.

Speaker 6:          01:50:43       No disrespect to the gay friends out there listening. Cheers to you. Hey, cheers to you. Hmm. Mm. I would definitely go in the past just to see what it was like an ancient Egypt or ancient Rome. I mean, uh, I just got back from Italy and we were, uh, we checked out Pompei of course, you know, and you wandering around where all these people died almost instantly from volcanic ash 20 feet high and you see other, you saw it right away and you can see the, there's one where they found recently where a dude got hit in the head by a flying boulder. He just see his skeleton and a giant rock where his head would be. It's a way to go. Yeah. I mean I got nothing though. Boom. Done blackness, DMT world DMTs out where we go. You think maybe there is, look at that and that's why you seeing not kinda got him.

Speaker 6:          01:51:33       Oh God. At that look at the article cause it says Fuck Paul pay, but fuck this man in particular, man. God was blowing from the mountain. Yup. Big Chunks of rock that gets spewed out of this volcano. Wow. Yeah. The whole thing's crazy. Like when you're, when you're wandering around Pompei and just realize that each face forward you got hit in a mug. Right? Like he saw it. Ah, right. Yeah. He got, yeah, it's true. I didn't even write that. He didn't, he wasn't running. Oh look at that one man. That was fucked. Is that just volcanic ash modification just preserved with volcanic ash. Look at its teeth. That is sane and if spooky, I'm dead. This, this guy is coming on my next trip for sure. Show up. Just show up.

Speaker 6:          01:52:33       Fuck. That is the way to go. Fall. Kainos men. I have a friend who goes to the big island every year for Thanksgiving and I'm like, you going back? He's like, fuck yeah. I'm like, you're crazy. You're going by. That thing's on fire. I would have it splits in half and sprays out like it's, it's taken over. Then the gods we've made the gods mad. Palae was pissed. What? What area did you do? Do you think you go to the wild west? Where do you think you would go? Oh, I was, I around it towards pirates, but then you surely whip shot me back. So yeah, we'd probably be, how about Lewis and Clark? If you could go on a Lewis and Clark expedition, how wow would that be? Make your way across the unknown. No one knew what the fuck. What the fuck? Just taking a chance.

Speaker 6:          01:53:23       Try to walk across the United States. I mean that's, that's, that's almost as you're saying, the same era. I wanted to go and Columbus just trying to like, you know what? Let's just say Lacrosse is flat. Earth. Yeah. Yeah. Now it wasn't flat. Now we're back to flat. Some people we discovered it wasn't flat and now we're back to flat and I have value and people want you to while doing the pilot school that I'm in. Like you have to keep adjusting for the curvature of the earth. No, no, no. It's not real. It's not real. The world's flat. It's flat. I like that TV.

Speaker 6:          01:53:58       It's just a lack of education. It's, it's an interesting thing too because it shows you how distracted people are, but that they want to argue about something that's already been figured out. Videos and the literature that people come up with for these insane, I can you Google earth you want by the time, by the time it's done, you're like, God damn. It might be flat and they're going to put this in the video. Cowboy realizes the earth is flat. He had a lot of good points there. Yeah. He's not sitting across from Neil degrasse Tyson because if he was Neil degrasse Tyson, but like hold on, hold on. That's not how it works. Hold on. That's wrong. Hold on. This is why we know that's incorrect. See, I don't have, I don't have the knowledge to be able to check, constantly readjust for the curvature of the earth.

Speaker 6:          01:54:50       I know that one fact and then and then the rest of them they're like, and then, and then I'm like the crazy ones. The water. Yeah. Water. Water doesn't stay on a curve. Yes. Does does. Yes it does. It does. Gravity. It's called the oceans and if gravity's not real, where the fuck do you think waves come from bitch there and what did they say? There's a glacier all around. Holding? Yes. Yeah, the 700 foot walls, an ice wall around the outside edge and then the government protects the ice wall when you see it. Why? Why would they? Why? Okay. This is just me. I'm nobody. I'm just Joe blow reading an article. Why would NASA and the government's been millions, billions. Trillions, right? To protect the fact that it's around earth. When it's flat to me, I would say, oh, we live on a flat earth.

Speaker 6:          01:55:44       This is where it gets even stupider because how would it affect my day to day? They're trying to protect us from the truth or shield the truth from us that we live in an incredible special environment. We live in the firmament that's protected by a dome. The creator is real and that all the elite powers want to keep this information from you. It's basically people that don't have an education, that are failures, that use all their energy misplaced to make these videos that don't make any sense. They've figured it out, they make sense. They make sense to me on the dummy that watch it. Like because anyone making a video where no one's interrupting you, no one's telling you you're incorrect, you're allowed to just continue to watch bullshit things over and over and over again unchecked. And so if you listen to this and they use big words and it sounds smooth, they have for, they have, you know, your drawing is behind them and charts.

Speaker 6:          01:56:37       And I'm like, clearly that picture shows, I definitely don't have degrees there. Ain't nobody with a degree out there that's telling you there's a nice wall. I don't know man. You can get some pretty shiny degrees lately. Well, there was an article recently about schizophrenia and I think anybody that thinks is really the ice wall and they have a degree, they should probably go to a doctor. They're probably on some sort of medication and something's wrong. There's some sort of a de levels are off. There's really think there's an ice wall around a plate. The earth shaped like a plate. So are they just pumping? They're just pumping oxygen in or our natural habitat creates it and they believe that, uh, that's a good question. They don't believe in gravity. So I don't know what they believe in. They think that I've ever, what happens when you're sending rockets?

Speaker 6:          01:57:21       It hits the dose or I'll fake bro rockets or fake satellites and fake, you know what else is fake dinosaurs? They don't believe in dinosaurs. But you want to know, show me Jamie. We just fake to, we just saw the mummy from the fuck Kanick. Yeah, right. And she fake. He's real. It might be fake. Looked at a picture on Google. We really [inaudible] he's real. The dude who got hit in the head with a rock is real as real as fuck. So the dinosaur that he got hit by a rock, he's fake. It could be, I wasn't there 65 million years ago is a long time. Yeah. Especially with the only 6,000 years old. They have one thing on their side and this is the one thing that they are on their side. This is one of the reasons why they make this argument. It's because when dinosaur bones were first discovered, when they were first discovered, there was a whole race to find dinosaur bones and there was a lot of fuckery. There was a bunch of people that were faking things and piecing things together. It didn't work and hiding bones and saying they found them. They were just trying to make a name for themselves, but that's just greedy human nature in the face of an actual real discovery. That's very valuable. That discovery was that they're dinosaurs, that there was a gigantic breed of lizards that Rome has millions of years ago. Yeah. And so all that's just propaganda.

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       So you're saying in in Colorado on the side of the mountain by red rocks, they have a whole closed off section where they're just doing masturbations. Yeah, Andy's a huge giant feet print in that. Yeah. In the rock that you can go up and touch a different, probably four or five different species of Badass lizards. My friend John, he's, he knows a dude who owns a ranch in Montana and they found a t rex on this guy's ranch. They pull the t rex out of this guy's ranch. They found it in the ground and they gave him a fuck load of money for it. I was like, if they find some sort of discovery like that, that's worth $1 million. Has to be. Yeah. It has to put that's fake. No, it's real as fuck. That's what I'm saying. They found this one thing that was poking up and he brought in these geology archaeologist. What? What would they be? All but it took you tell him you wouldn't have a t rex to hang on and keep one, two, one. Two is a person who searches for dinosaur bones. Like you have a bear tooth hanging. I have a fucking t. Rex tooth is an archaeologist. Right. I was thinking to archaeology being human history. No archeology is what? Your wife Paleontology. That's what they do because they're always digging up old shit.

Speaker 2:          02:00:04       Oh, that's so true. So true. True. They come at you, his ship get her a web. Oh yeah. Paleontologist. Yeah. So they called it a paleontologist paleontologist start cleaning off whatever this was, and then he's like, holy fuck. He's like, this is a Goddamn t rex. Apparently. It's like, Oh, a lot of it, you know, sometimes it's like you only found a couple of phones. Yeah, they found a lot of shit. So I would like to see that man, if I could go back when I'm drastic parks. So now I'd like to see that too. Now we're going all the way back. Yeah, that's, that's Colorado right there. That is fucking insane. Insane. So what the fuck? That is insane. Yeah. Do you know how much time that would take to, to falsify that? They going out with dessert. Here's, so you've got to brainwash five people and tell them more.

Speaker 2:          02:01:00       Warren and do is wrangle chip this rock out because we've got to fucking fake a bunch of people. Have you seen this in person? Yeah, I've been there. Walked all that. You crawl over it? You just like walk on, walk on, walk on it. Well she a little gate right there if you back out a little bit. Yeah, a little gate, but that's just a little gate. There it is right there. The little girl. That's crazy man. I mean that's right there in Colorado. Wow. Right by red rock. Yeah, exactly. It's right there. It's hard to book a Gig and red rocks, man. They're booked up til like 2021 22 you can do a live show in red rock. Fucking epic. I was trying, but I can only get

Speaker 6:          02:01:40       like Tuesday nights and Wednesday nights up until I know what? Tuesday night, Tuesday night is better than never. Never. No night. Yeah. Fucking so I'm going to need a couple of tickets. So the people don't believe the earth is the believe the earth is flat and I'll round. They don't believe in dinosaurs. They don't believe in nuclear weapons either. Wow. That's the other one. Nuclear weapons are a hoax hoax. Yeah. Only a few people don't believe Australia is a hoax. And a lot of people say that's disinflation and discredit plane fly upside down and shit. And that's all upside down. And that's where the Australians coming from. Cause Kyle notes in Australia right now. I could probably call him. Um, he's probably a government agent bro. Shit, any phone call you make to him was just going straight to the Illuminati. Kyle. Yeah Bro. Yeah. You gotta be real careful.

Speaker 6:          02:02:36       What does he do? Is he retired now? He's coming back. He's trying to come back really well the problem is he didn't fight. He, his UFC career out, uh, when he retired. So we'll still have them under contract under the contract. How many more fights don't, didn't get into that. So you wanted to retire and fight somewhere else? I think he just wanted to retire, but now he's got the itch again cause each comes, she's like, yeah, fuck it. I'll come back to maybe whatever. And they're like, no, you come back with us or are you going to come back at all? Gotcha. Contact legal agreements. Tricky world we live in and I figure if he was a government agent he could just sweep that under the rug. Right. You have a tendency to obvious as far as the cover, part of the cover is you get a blocked in the contract.

Speaker 6:          02:03:21       So he's becomes one of the regular working man. He is a working man. I can say to you, damn standing dot goddamn contract and you're like, you're one of us Kyle. Meanwhile he's wearing a wire. Damn Damn. Yukon is the worth flat Kyle. It's definitely not to say water world. Antidoping agency wallet. Let's watch her. The water's upside down. My mom. Yeah. Yeah. There are a different breed of human over there. They just, they evolved for hunting because they're prisoners. We just, what a great idea. Bring them to the best place on earth and drop them. But the stupid, yes. Wait, I don't have the, I'm not getting the debt. Oh, you're just dropped me on. It's super bad ass island. That's bigger than the one you're on. Bigger than when you were on way better weather. Way better weather. Gorgeous. And then they dropped all these prisoners off and they started like crazy hierarchy. And the ones that didn't really make it just went into the bush. Yeah, they're still there today. And then there's the aborigines who were already there and then on top of

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       that hot chicks, I don't know what they did to grow them hot out there in Australia. Something about the, the prisoner genes, the wild prisoner genetics, some about that wild fucking criminal gene. While criminal dreams are are the, are the crazy alpha male guys, the guys that are there like the weaker 2018 liberals are saying, whoa, no, you can't do that. Yeah. Was a lot of that troll going on to the, can't do that. So you're going to Australia? Yeah. Use the word faggot users faggot. Damn. That's one of the last words I got in trouble with EOC for saying faggot. I'm not allowed to say it anymore. Well you already just did. I know you're just making the noise. Yeah, this is, this is like a, this is like a shell. We're in a bubble. Okay. So did they, it's Vegas. I'm drinking all night and they had me do this show at 8:00 AM on a Sunday morning to reflect the fight.

Speaker 1:          02:05:46       It was me and I'm a cm punk and I'm reflecting the fight that DC had with Anderson Silva, who I respect. Appreciate. Great Dude. I didn't like the way DC fought that fight. So when somebody asks you about it, I said if anyone out there like a fucking faggot and held him, you know, he didn't fight to win. Right. Well that was completely out of context. I didn't mean that. Like, I didn't mean like he was a homosexual. I just say faggot like, like you're a bitch and you're a punctual. I have to explain myself. UFC makes me put on this a rainbow shirt and tell them I have problem with jumbo shirt. Rainbow. Oh, rainbow. They made you put on a rainbow shirt. Oh, share the PR team and, and, and apologize. And you know, because I have him as homophobic in and of itself, I have all the, all the, the gay activist rights coming after me.

Speaker 1:          02:06:39       Now they're wanting money. How strange is that? They want money from me because I offended on it. I should donate. I did have to do any, I did donate. So anyways, I tried to get on it and explain Muslim. I said, man, I didn't call him a Faggot, like a faggot. I called him a faggot bitch. And that backfired. Big Time. Yeah. And I, I mean that's just how I talk. I if I called you a punk bitch Faggot, that's just, that's just what I said. I don't mean it in any other way other than that. But the thing is, here's the thing, right? And I don't mean it homophobia. Homophobia is bad. Right? But our words, our words bad. Like what if you feel the same way? Like is it a real issue is in I have to pee so bad. Good, good. Pete. All right, you gotta pick your beer? Yeah, I'm three and good luck. Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:07:36       I think all words are dependent upon the context and your intent. Like what do you, what do you mean have you say to someone like, come on bitch, like in there, your friend that it's fun. But if you say to someone, come on bitch, and then you hate them. Those exact same words or taking on a totally different meaning. And that's the same thing with every word except the n word, the n word. It's like it's so toxic. You can't even use it joking around and you definitely can't use it the way you could say almost any other word. So like,

Speaker 7:          02:08:16       yeah,

Speaker 6:          02:08:16       well I had a bit that I was trying out for a while but I had a abandoned it. Where else like the n word is one word that you can't even call yourself. Like you, you can't even say God, I'm such an n word because faithful get fucking mad at you. You can't even say it. But if you're, but here's the catch. If you're a black guy you could toss that shit around like a beach ball at a concert and it's fine.

Speaker 7:          02:08:42       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:08:43       If you're a black girl you could use it as well. Although a little more sparingly please

Speaker 6:          02:08:49       grace. They can't use it the same amount. Black girls like tend to use it just a little bit more leniently but they could do whatever they want with that word. It's one of the more fascinating words I think in human history in terms of like its its impact. What it means and how it can ruin your career. Like didn't that one congressman have to resign because Sasha Baron Cohen had him yelling out the n word. Right. What was he was just because of that, but that probably it was on the list of things. What was he, what did he do? Was he a representative George and maybe this bigger future. What is up open? That commode you got in there I think does everything does everything. She taught water up your asshole. Ooh Wee. It's warm when you sit down. It was wonderful. He did. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:09:37       You would fit in great with the pirates if you said guys, just trying to complain, Bro. Come try my commode out. It gives a little hotter shall walk. You're not homophobic guy. No you're not. But it's, it's one of those things where if you say it, I guess if you're a gay person and you hear someone say you'd be really upset, like they are being homophobic. The problem is like the, we had, this bitch is not good enough. No certain situ and they're trying to get that one to remember. W W Kamau bell wouldn't say, he says he doesn't say bitch anymore. I'm like, all right dude, you're self censoring or limiting language. I did this podcast with wolf man serious, and he tells me that he now not a homophobic at all. I just caught me off guard. I didn't know, I didn't know how to take it. When he told me that he experiments, he didn't kind of know if he like boys or girls. And I was like, oh, Jason Ellis. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. And I was like, what? You don't know what you like, here's the guy had been to a couple parties, you know? And I just go both ways and we just have groups of people and sometimes it'd be groups of guys. And I was just scratching my head and like,

Speaker 7:          02:10:51       Huh,

Speaker 6:          02:10:53       ah, okay. I didn't know how to, I didn't know how to, how to take that out. Right. If you don't expect it. And I've known him for years, years. They dropped this ball on me and I was like, man, uh, I don't, I didn't know how to take it. It was just, it caught me off guard. It was weird. He's like, what do you think? You think? I like girls, but I also like, or I thought, I liked guys

Speaker 6:          02:11:18       what I wanted to say. And what I say are two different things. You know? It's like, what'd you want to say? I want him to say, man, um, no offense, but man, you put a dick in your mouth and you are a Faggot, but this, so now you changed. No, I understand that you've wanted to say that you wanted is that the inner me was wanting to say and I just looked at him like, fuck, I didn't what? I was just so blown back by it. But why is that shocking if people are definitely gay, it's not shocking because you didn't expect, I didn't expect it, but it's not shocking that someone's gay. It's like there's a lot of gay people, right? Nothing wrong with it. I don't care at all, nor do I, but when you don't expect someone to be gay and then you're like, whoa, because then you thought that he was like, you look like you and I were just a couple of straight guys hanging out for meanwhile.

Speaker 6:          02:12:11       He, meanwhile, he was not. He is, uh, the one thing that is odd with me, with people that say things like that is that they go sometimes. Sometimes I like guys and sometimes I like girls. Like I couldn't imagine. What would that, that would be like or you're not sure? You're not sure. So me like, what do you mean you don't talk straight sometimes you not like Joe, no matter what. Every time I go to basket robins, I get vanilla. That's what I'm going to work with strawberry, you know, like rocky road. Sometimes I'll, I'll, I'll dabble in there, but if you brought me back vanilla, you know, I'm gonna like that, you know? It's not like, well, as long as I go there. Right. I mean, there's people that do look, they're just wired different. There's nothing wrong with it. As long as he's not trying to fuck you, but why would that be a problem?

Speaker 6:          02:13:01       All of a sudden will be a problem if you don't want to fuck him. True. [inaudible] it makes you realize what it's like to be a girl in the most insignificant ways. Cause with the girls, obviously most more dangerous because guys are bigger than you and you're going to actually hold you down and fuck you. But when, when you're around gay guys, I used to work out at a gay gym when I was doing news radio, right? I worked at Gold's gym and Cole and I used to describe it. I was a tasty little morsel in a big gay stu just, it was the closest gym to the studio, so great gem, but it was filled with aggressive gay guys that had like those. They had those scrunchy socks, like fucking, they were in a music video from the 1980s like their flashdance socks. These guys like timberlands and style, like Super Tan and Roy it up and just hit nine each other left and right.

Speaker 6:          02:13:51       Leather vests on us. I mean it was crazy. It was such a crazy scene and when you go there, you realize that these guys are, they're like leering at you. They're not looking at you like a guy going, what's up man? How are you doing? You know, use the triceps, you know? No, it wasn't that they would be looking at you if you walked into an all female lesbian super smoke show Jim. That's how you'd be looking. All of them. I go, Oh yeah, but I cas have you want me to you all all lesbian fee because all lesbian Jim, they probably looked like Tom Arnold and my fantasy that I'm in, they're hall like super high fitness models. I get in there working out, hitting each other. If they were legit lesbians, they'd be like, what the fuck are you looking at? That'd be the same.

Speaker 6:          02:14:37       Then you would be the perpetrator. It you'd be feeling like the guys look at you and you're like, what the fuck you looking at? Yeah. I mean, the real thing is I, I feel like, uh, gay and straight people, everybody can get along fine as long as everyone's on the same page. And as long as they're not trying to fuck you, if you don't want it and you're not trying to fuck them if they don't want it. Like if you're not trying to fuck these lesbians cause you, you, you, you respect. In fact, they only like girls. That's all great and the gay guys aren't trying to fuck you, but can we get tell by looking at someone, can we get mad at the double standard? You're saying, Hey, these gay guys, they say sometimes, what about these girls that are like, well, I sometimes like girls and sometimes I like guys and girls and then you're listening.

Speaker 6:          02:15:22       I'm like, yeah, that sounds like a pretty good idea. It does sound a good idea and I think we should shut the fuck up about that. Otherwise they're going to get insecure or they've got to stop that practice, let them keep going and have a good time. But all of a sudden the guy's like, God, that's not like girls. Hey Joe, you want to come on the guide shipping? We're hypocrites. Hypocrites. Yeah. But there's something about God for straight guys. The idea of a guy fucking you or making you suck his dick is the most horrific thing.

Speaker 6:          02:15:52       It'd be relaxed to the cave diving experience for me that the nightmares would be, but I have no zero ill will towards them. And I don't have any problem with them in any way in society, in any way, shape or form. I'm not even remotely homophobic gay people. Sure. But there's a reality that gay dudes are dudes and dudes are kind of gross and they will try to fuck you. You know? And that's the one thing I had a friend of mine who was a, he was a, a wardrobe guy and he was a gay guy. And he was always telling me about these straight dudes that he would, uh, he would lord the man and turn them and get them suck. His Dick was hilarious. He goes, tell stories about that. About about college, how the gay guys would fuck the football players. And I'm like, wait, the big bad football college guys who are getting what?

Speaker 6:          02:16:47       Yeah, he didn't. Same. Same thing you'd say that's theirs. Theirs, they love it. They love the term. Like just like a guy would love to turn a lesbian club. That'd be a mission when it, yeah, I used to have a joke about that, that guys believe in gay guys. Like I believe in gay guys, but I don't really believe in lesbians. I think they think they're lesbians cause that's just cause they ain't got to hold it this way. They got me, I turn, every guy looks at a lesbian like, hey, I know she thinks she's a lesbian. Let me fuck her a couple of times. It'd be nice to her. We're like, I can eat pussy way better than another girl. I don't know Torrance. She's no way. And I brought the Dick but not, not only nice fuzzy and I brought the dam. The data. Yeah. So men don't necessarily totally believe in lesbian. I don't. They 100% believe in gay dudes. Then why? Why don't butch girls act more like soup? I mean they do. They cut their hair and they were, some of them do, but the gay guys all got the snap and depressed.

Speaker 6:          02:17:59       There's some fucking like beefy bodybuilder gay dudes that look like straight guys. Yeah. You can't tell. Yeah. Do they slap your ass in the gym? Take good. Whoa. No, I want to get a beer after you stop right there. It's like you should be a way to tell like they have different markets, you know shit kinds of birds. Like oh that's a female. It's a female. Birds see those extra feathers. But what if it's a transgender? Now what if it's wearing female feathers? But who? That's an odd one, right? Because that's one that like we didn't have children. So how do you feel about if you're little girl has to go to the bathroom but there's a guy girl in there? Well like what draws the line? I would hope that either way, like if you are a son is going to the bathroom, there's some pedophile child molester that preys on boys and he asked me a guy and he's in that bathroom.

Speaker 6:          02:19:00       It has nothing to do with your, your sexual orientation has to do with you being a Predator and a piece of shit. But that could happen for straight people just as easily as it happened for gay people. Diseases happen for Trans People. It's, it's someone who's willing to pray on smaller people that are vulnerable. I was just, I wasn't even going to pedal. Like there's a lot of like trans people that would be more than happy to be really friendly to your daughter and it would be an issue at all. She pulls out a wiener and peas and you're doing a show and your daughter's like, and your daughter's like, what the Hell, dad? Um, right. But what if you had a girl who became a transgender girl? She's big tits, but she wanted to keep her dick. Yeah. And where, where she go. She's wearing a skirt, high heels right now.

Speaker 6:          02:19:48       Today. Where should go? Which bathroom? Shoes. I don't know. I want to say, I want to say she's got, she's got the equipment right. She's got the equipment and full equipment. Full equipment for, for the male female, but just tits, like his bro example, go to bally Jay's Twitter page. I'm just saying that, that, I think that would worry. She feels like a woman. But she was born a man. Dick. Yeah, but she has a dick, but she's as Co Bailey. Jay's my favorite example. I hope she doesn't mind me using her because she's a transgender girl. That I like is as much a girl as you could possibly get while still having a dick. Like see, look at that set. Right. That confused the fuck out of here. Right? Like, Hey, what's going on here now go to the media or media page. They kill her now.

Speaker 6:          02:20:39       She's alive. No. Did they, do they like Jonah? I mean, she says she pulls her out. This is the thing. She's got a giant Dick. So she's got these big tests and then hey, there you go. Oh Man. Yeah. So where does she paying, you know I'm, I'm cool with her going to the girls' room and what? I mean just she's going to probably squat. It's not like she's going to stand there with their pants down. Just hosing the wall. Letting everybody know you feel, I mean if she went into the men's room, that would cause more of a conflict. Yeah. Could you imagine, could you imagine something like that? Do you're saying let her go into the female? Yeah. Not just for safety, but just like who she identifies with. Look, it's a weird thing, right? Because the Trans Person Is, do you go into the family room?

Speaker 6:          02:21:26       Do you go into family bathroom in between? That's probably the, that's the safe bet. Ironic. She's anti if she's not going to make a family with what there's going on, that's so confusing. That is so how does that kind of pregnant? Yeah. I mean not yet, but to maybe in our machines you can also change agenda Changer. That would be a way where transgender people would probably be the most happy, where they didn't have to like hormonally become a woman and through surgery and throw it, but instead they just actually turn you into a woman. Bam. My time. You done. Oh, you want to be a girl being and maybe go back. Well, if that's the case, yeah, you could go there and back. Where do I sign up and Zach, because I'm going, I'm going to go check this out. See what it's like for a couple of days a week. Go to Vegas, let a couple of dudes banging. Yeah. Now for dot. Now that's another one. That's weird. Now. It's weird. It's weird again, because you have that memory when you back and tell my friends like, dude, I want to bang. They got still out.

Speaker 6:          02:22:37       It's always in the back of your throat. Yeah. So yeah. Yeah. That would have to be a giant issue. So yeah. You say you would try it, but then you had to have the memory of trying it. Yeah. You'd have to in the middle, you could maybe pass that you were a girl. Maybe, but one of the guys trying to fuck, you'd be like, Hey, no dude, no, no. But he's like, but you're a girl. Would you do a random or would you think you'd do a friend of yours that you'd like? Would you give any Bravo, Bravo. I heard some shit. Let's go. Not only would I do a rant about where a mask like fucking eyes wide shut, but that's the, when you as a girl, you wouldn't look like you as a girl when you hotter, hotter to give out of curly hair. He had his god damn. Imagine if you zapped over to the female and you were just precious, are you? They're like, oh, you problem a problem. A real problem.

Speaker 6:          02:23:47       Yeah. Fuck yeah. So they made you wear a rainbow shirt, isn't it? They sold it to about how gay people took over the rainbow. I'm like, it's, there is a rainbow. It used to be in leprechauns pots of gold. Nope, not anymore. Not Anymore. They took that shit over. They own, I don't, I don't fully understand. I'm sure someone will comment on your youtube page, youtube page here and tell you why that uh, why, why, why the rainbow? Well, it's just beautiful. Everybody could fit along. It's beautiful colors. They're flamboyant. They're like a lot of colors. But all those colors together, like Yay. Everyone's getting along with all the colors. Flamboyant. No. Can you say all know this bears right? There has to be. There's, yeah, because some of the guys still like, yeah. Did you guys shit, Shit. Fuck, fuck. Ah, fine. Nothing wrong with that.

Speaker 6:          02:24:42       But the words is what kills him. F word. I don't say it. Don't say Donald Serone please, please make a donation here. It's one of those words as growing up as kids, it didn't really mean a gay person like Louis Ck had a whole bit about it. That didn't mean you didn't. But we're supposed to evolve our folks at call you a fancy. I've done that. I don't mean it like that as me. You don't mean this is a gay person, bitch. I don't mean you're a female dog. It's just, it's just, it's the same word. Bitch is like level one. But faggot is like the gold level. It's like, listen, we're not playing around and playing. You said it, you cut. If I add the gas, didn't hear like you fucking

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       cunt, Bro. That's, I went there, I went to the, at def con five. But if we're in London or in the no man's Land Australia and they just say, oh, you fucking cheeky. Cont you know, they think it's cut. It's the word they use. Yeah. So I guess because they use it all. I mean, I don't know, just words, the words. Yeah, words are words, but it's, you know, if they're ineffective, you know, and also would they hurt so bad? Yeah. Do you can, you can kill. I mean, dude, you, especially if there's some reality to it. That's the thing. Like I promise today we're going to get some good ones. There's going to be some, yeah, but you can't read those. I'm going to read them and I'm like, how are you hard right next to him. He was such a big, you're living your life.

Speaker 2:          02:26:10       Use this big character. Why? Why paid God? I love you. I love living a life. I wish more people would get out there and live life. Joe. Yeah, the, I get so much shit for that. Like I can't believe you're not training. You're out living. And I said, man, look at my life like I'm retired right now. Why do I want to do all this cool shit when I'm 50 and I can't, I can do right now in my prime will. Also, when people are young, they do whatever they want to do. I then, it's like when you get old you're supposed to become more serious. Sure. I remember when you decided to try to be more serious for a while and it fucked you up. Fuck me up. It wasn't the way you limited your expression. Yeah. That's a good way to throw it in because I think I love doing all this wild to create living who you are is having fun. Yeah. It's like the like if I die here and you're like cowboy, change of plans. We're not doing the podcast, we're going skydive and I'd be like, you are you speaking to my heart? I'm going to do a podcast from skydiving. Skydiving. So tell me about John.

Speaker 2:          02:27:14       Why did they make you wear rainbow shirt? Why a rainbow? 30 seconds. It'd be a very short podcast. Well, the UFC has to do damage control on savages, which is hilarious. Yes. I have a bunch of people like you and Mike Perry and you know, fill in the blank.

So nibbles or should be. There should be some aerial hanging out. Yeah, because you got no areola. She's an alien. That's barely a person. Do you think aliens have beautiful girls or are they beautiful alien?

Speaker 6:          02:29:12       I think they gave up on pussy. This is what I think. What does this guy get this guy for? Stop it if you are, if you think your life is bad, these are Simon's brother. One is gay and they just got one ass. Oh my God. Are they really? Oh God. Did you hear it? That you just said is that really think your life is bad? One is gay and one ass kissing one of them. That's the, that's not real. That's the general part. Yeah. Kissing. I don't even want to know if he has one ass part is what clears into the Ras to scroll down. If you could see the accident. If you go, there's a highway video. So this is the gentlemen from hours basis. No, that's sign it. That's funny. I haven't seen that one. I haven't seen the jumping from outer space one.

Speaker 6:          02:29:58       Um, but there's one where a guy's standing on the side of the highway right next to a black SUV and someone plows into the SUV at full blast and someone else flies out of the back of the SUV, flies into the air and lands in their feet and starts walking. Come on. It's fucking crazy. He posts so many. This is crazy. I mean, how far was it? No. Did they pull it? Where's he at with the rattlesnake? What's the date of that? What is the rattlesnake one happening? Oh yeah. He probably got it pulled. His shit gets pulled. Does it get hold, I guess?

Speaker 7:          02:30:34       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:30:35       People find out about it, but people sometimes outer space jump. I haven't seen it. That ain't it. Whoa. Crashes has to crash. Someone does. Yeah. I love it.

We shared that. I use it only in referenced the time cop smells things. My word, the word limiting. Limiting expression in strange ways today. Yeah. Half of it is as much about people getting mad at you and wanting to be able to censor you or to get control of you or to be angry at you or to shut you down or get you fired to get you to put that rainbow shirt on. It's like half of it.

Speaker 7:          02:33:13       Well,
