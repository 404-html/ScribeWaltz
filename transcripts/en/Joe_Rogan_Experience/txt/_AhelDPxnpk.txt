Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Yo,

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       what

Speaker 1:          00:00:10       the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight bought to you by several things were brought to you for you guys. This is the most important part.

Speaker 1:          00:00:20       Were brought together the whole thing. It's all for you. It's all for you, but we've got to pay bills than with cost money. What's that? Dramatic opening by the way? You had this fucking too high to talk. How to wait a few seconds and wait for the moment to achieve me. We did the music after the commercials, so it's easy to edit if somebody wants to. Nobody wants to listen. These goddamn commercials I'd have to do. I'm back. Joe. I've returned. What was the last time you used your flashlight? A. Actually, I use it all weekend because my girl was at avn was really hard because every hot girl was outside of Los Angeles and went to Vegas. It seemed like. No. So you had a hard time masturbating pretending on hot girls in town. Right? What a fucking twisted world you live in. Where you think that all went.

Speaker 1:          00:01:05       All the porn stars are out of town. Well, no more attractive now. There's like an energy in the air, you know, and if it leaves, it's like a ghost town. It feels really empty inside. Your world is inexorably tied to the porn world at this point. That's why. Yeah, it's weird. Yeah, it's very strange. You live a strange life, my friend. Yeah. So you had to like beat it all weekend. Yeah, I did. I went crazy. I went ape shit. Nice. It's a solid product. That flashlight. It's a. I'll tell you what, just just for sheer impact of effectiveness, efficacy is better than anything we promote. It's better than any of the vitamins. It's better than anything, but it's nice to have mental clarity. But to really be able to shoot fucking blasto loads like, like you can with a flashlight. Have you seen that thing that they may.

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       One of our, uh, rants on past podcasts where it's an ipad holder that you can kind of attach a fleshlight yeah. And so now you can sit there and they had this porn, like first person shooter type form that you sit there and watch on your ipad while it. And holding it while it's connected to your flashlight. It's just the beginning. Just the beginning. It's once it goes virtual, that's when things are going to be really strange when there's somehow or another, like the put a helmet on you and then the fleshlight moves up and down your Dick. And probably like a bunch of flashlights all over your body by doing right. Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       Anyway, the flashlights should be. You should be able to take the Alpha brains and fuck the fleshlight. You shouldn't combine. That's, that's the secret right there. Yeah. Chemists to be too smart while you're fucking of fake pussy. Better off. Like we have like Alpha dumb pills, mushrooms, psychedelic trip as you fucking coming. So let's say you fucked a purple one. You'd think of purple things. I don't know. I would like to know what my Iq is when I have a hard on because I bet it's half. Yeah. I would like to know what my Iq is when I have a book in three thinking nothing else. It's amazing. You know, women realize that, you know, when they realized that when they try to become men like Chaz Bono, you know, she's, one of the things she's saying is like now she understands like male behavior. She does it. She understands it. She understands she was, she understands.

Speaker 3:          00:03:21       Yes. She's been a man. Go get your two year old and say she's all fucking fat with that fucking bitch. You don't trick me. You don't like that beard. I just don't listen to people want to have parties for a little while. She's going into a deep water here. She made the conversion. She went right beep into being a fucking man because you strap a pair on and don't. Like I said today, you can't fucking to just drop a pair and nuggets on and go out there and sling. I always fucking know that you're the real deal. You know who you kidding? You Been Sucking Dick for 20 years. Now you want to change. Fucking governments can't do that shit. You can change government changing government. It's two different. Fucking world's man, a fucking woman. I. You know what ma'am?

Speaker 1:          00:04:06       Wouldn't you hate to have been born? What if you imagined you were man, but you were really a woman. You really wish you were a woman like that would fucking be so frustrating.

Speaker 3:          00:04:14       Gotcha it.

Juices going sometimes when you open your eyes, you don't know what the fuck. Yeah. Look, sometimes you find on your foot in the flashlight, it goes right to the bottom, like Hershey's chocolate.

A pickle company in Boston that had these homemade pickles and we're selling them in the park and I'll fucking. Awesome. Now they got ahold of me and they sent me some. Oh you fucking. Oh my God. He's a fucking pickles are ridiculous dude. They have these hot Habanero pickles, pickles with like slices of Jalapeno and Habanero in it. They're like really spicy pickles. Damn. They're good. Feel like fresh and just crispin woo sliced cheese burger. Tremendous fucking serious pickles. I know. It seems like I'm excited about talking about Chaz.

Speaker 1:          00:10:12       Chaz Bono. That's what is, you know, was crazy by Chaz Bono. She's got to look like Ralphie May. Once she had the surgery, was like fuck, I mean Chaz Bono is that, that is the most amusing story to me of last year and I don't fuck with it really. I just don't fuck with it. It's just the, it's just creeps me to fuck out one way or the other. I don't know why I feel really bad for you. No, I uh, I just feel like if you, if you're going to go through with that for I feel bad for one way or the other, either I feel bad for her because she really is a man trapped in a woman's body and that must be really frustrating or I feel bad for that. She's, you know, she's in this state of disarray where that's the option and you've got to go through surgery and it just seems to me like anybody that would need to do that for any reason just to actually change and try to become something else and become some different sex, you know, that's, that's a, that's a deep dissatisfaction with your current life and you know, who's to say that maybe her solution isn't becoming a man to play rugby first and then come back.

Speaker 1:          00:11:13       You know what I'm saying? I like to know she's happier now mean that there'll be an interesting call. I knew I knew a comedian in Seattle that was a man and became a woman. Had the surgery, the whole psychological one through the whole thing. And uh, it was hard on her. Her name was Rita. Oh, her head was fucking huge. Time to time. That's how she died. She fucked up. God was too big. She was at a club. She fucking went down like a boxer named Rita. Oh, well, you know what happened to. He's in a white, I think Seattle. I'm not joking. I wish I was, but I'm not joking. She used to, we used to stay at brody, Stevens and me used to steal her Nachos at open mic and she had a womanly voice and when we were still on Nachos she'd say pour them the fuck down.

Speaker 1:          00:11:59       We would just stop. I robbed the bank. 100 values from her and she put a gun to my head. This bitch, she was five foot two and she died maybe two years after I moved out of Seattle as brody when, when she got she got the full operation. You've got to get the full moon when they, when you do that, your body really like shrinks up their mass. Right. And maybe maybe you really, if you have a big head and maybe it will work as long as you have a big body to go with it, but if you have a big hand a little bit like that, like dad actually does make sense that she would be like, she was often because your muscles go away with the size of your head is like. And her drug problem was, uh, it was just horrendous. The drug problem that she had from the pain, like and one night from the pain of the surgery, like know the pain of.

Speaker 1:          00:12:45       She just drank every night. She didn't leave the house without a bottle in her purse. I mean, Geez, one night we did an open mic and the guy threw her out of Arab throughout. She went home and we talked to her into calling the White House. It was the cocaine we played. You got to call the White House. Do you remember that dude? He used to come around. The comedy store's Kinda. It was Kinda half homeless, half crossdresser type character. The black guy was his name. Boom. Shaka Laka my ship from my girlfriend from that guy like faces and shoes and a half a hooker.

Speaker 1:          00:13:22       I love bikes with a fucking. He's had some nutty moments, man. One time when he was in the back of the comedy store and he was like yelling at no one in particular, fuck this motherfucker like really mad at somebody and he went and stormed into the little bathroom there was washing up in the air and they were trying to get rid of them. They're trying to calm her down and get him off the porch. I don't know exactly what happened, but I was like, wow, this dude's fucking mad. Some shit's about to go down. Well they would tease him on Sunday nights and torture him and then he would go fucking awol black on you. Fuck this motherfucker. I'll kill you and all this shit. There's something that happened with him and Dan by Bilac Bilac. But yeah, it's something happy between those tickets. He always carries around signs and things like going against him.

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       So I think or maybe it's vice versa. I don't know. You don't know what the story is, but I'll talk about that tonight at another park, Bro. Be the Friday night meeting you and Duncan trussell. Let me tell say I've been excited about going to Chicago. Chicago is one of those cities that you know nothing. It's always like you never really think about you. You're on your way there. Then you get excited. You get really fucking excited. We're going down to the city, great fights. You know the great Italian food, great Polish food does everything that everything per roghey's stakes. We're in the Midwest and one other thing. You better dress warm motherfucker. It's called the cops that arrested Tony Montana at time for fucking money. Laundry. Mom, you said you'd been addressed? Warm is going to be fucking cold. Will go on in the, in the nucleus of the winter, the last week of January that the fucking storm says the [inaudible] days and cold and you have a winter jacket.

Speaker 1:          00:15:05       Fuck yeah, I do. You can have one of my man. I have boxes of them. I've got an awesome fucking believable that will go on into the wind, will go into the eye of the storm. So awesome. And I don't give a fuck. I'm redheaded child son and base being, oh my gosh, I'm Chael Sonnen and bisping is going to be fucking crazy. I just wished that fight could take place a couple months from now instead of like this weekend. So I want to hear more trash talking from these guys. I want to hear more. Not even try. I mean they're not even trash talk and like, you know, bisping is confident as fuck man, this is going to be real interesting. I think on the people sleep on this thing for some reason I don't sleep on those things. He's a bad business and it's going to be a.

Speaker 1:          00:15:47       he's one of the fittest guys at one 85 too. He's very fit. He's like, he's a dedicated athlete and like he puts a pace on dudes mad, you know, a lot of sick people say made him look really bad. And then in the last fight may have definitely looked bad, but one of the, part of the reason why he looked bad because Michael bisping look good. He looks sharp, man. His standup was sharp, his conditioning sharpest. Fucking his defense was sharp when the fight went to the ground, everything was good man. And he, he put it on mayhem. And you saw like an evolution of him over the last few years, you know, you, you can see in the Jorge reverify, see in this fight and the mayhem fight really in the mayhem fight, you really see it. Like he's turned a serious fucking corner. You know Michael.

Speaker 1:          00:16:35       But Michael Bisping's dangerous. And you know what I loved about the fight after it was over, he was upset at himself for the first round, even though he had this like flawless performance and virtually shut out mayhem, you know, until the fight got stopped. Once he got up to his feet, the second round started, he just shut him down, just completely shut him down. And if you. And if you see that you would think, well he should be happy, but he wasn't happy. And one of the first things he said was that he was upset at his performance in the first round. Wasn't going to do if you ever fought the champion. Does the first thing you said. So there's a guy who's not even not even congratulating them himself for, you know, he had this big rivalry with may hand. They went through a whole season of the ultimate fighter together, talk to all kinds of shit to each other, and he just fucked him up and he wasn't even being like congratulatory about it.

Speaker 1:          00:17:21       He was concentrating on what he didn't do well, but he wanted to own them perfectly. You know what I see with him is his life has come full circle. He's come, he's become completely moved his family over from England. He's training down in Orange County. He's got his family with them, which makes a big difference when you fucking training. He already took the knockout. No, he got that knock out again. Tennis and he caught himself, found himself and he's ready. He's ready. He's much better now. Yeah, he's much better now. He's a better place if they say it's hard

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       for a fighter to rebound from a loss like that, you know, it's very difficult. I mean, I can only imagine. I'm only speculating, but from what I've experienced watching people, you know, fighters will change from losses. Catch

Speaker 1:          00:18:01       fucking knock Gavigan tendus and that'll, you know, just getting beat up at the fucking pizza parlor. Changes a motherfucker want to knock out like that

Speaker 5:          00:18:10       came back strong. Dennis Kang and one of the big things is Dennis Kang caught him. Remember Dennis Kang tagged and with the right hand, dropped them a jumped on him, but he stayed calm. He used his guard, he had a real good defensive guard, locked them up. And then the second run he beat the shit out of him today. Know people sleep on them. Man. I don't know why it's real weird. It's like I, I see them sleeping on him and I think it's because maybe you see a guy lose once and you think that's how the guy flights, you know, instead of saying it's looking at the whole picture, that motherfucker had a draw with Rashad. Dude. You know, he didn't he or was it Tito? How to draw with them? No, it was, it was, uh, did he lose to Rashad? I think it was a draw.

Speaker 5:          00:18:49       What's the draw? Okay. I don't know. I feel like I feel like I just made that up. But it was, yeah, let me check. Let me look under shirt. Org Dot net. Oh, someone. Someone from shirt or wrote some whole thing saying that I hate shirt off because I was talking shit about their forums. Listen man, I don't particularly completely hate anybody. I'm sure your forums have some nice people on it and every form has a bunch of consulting including my own. So I love all around vegges. All right. Um, so yeah, stats who would go, bulk of them have a one at the end. Yeah. They say, Hey, let's just not make for fucking thrilling podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:19:29       Yeah, let's talk numbers. Joy, what would you say? Uh, his stats would be fucking stats. I don't know who Brian is. The girlfriend was doing his impression right now of what he thinks like a sportscaster would do. He Won A. Rashad wanted a decision, you have it, but you know, he was fighting much bigger. Guys should never been fighting it to. Oh, he's a tiny two old timey guy. He's just not. I would not say he's a tiny guy. He's a big one. 80 five. The first time I seen, what's his name and uh, in, in, in Pittsburgh, Anthony Johnson. I thought he was a fucking defensive tackle. Yeah. He's, you know, those guys and being compared to the hands of time. Have you see, you know, when you see a WHO's the forrest griffin? I took the bait. They released Anthony Johnson. Yeah, I know that. That's. What did you think the thing that was gonna happen.

Speaker 1:          00:20:17       So I knew right then and there when you. I read the twit. I bet if he won, if he won, he probably would have been able to keep his job. He would had to come out and knock his fucking head off in Brazil at home. Knock him when he tried, man, I'm telling you, he blew his wad going out and trying because he tried to kill vetoer. He went after him. Man. It was blue is one is actually a, a gambling term, Brian, for you don't know. It was a wad of cash. And when you come out of the gates strong and gambling and then you have no more money. It's called the blue. It's white. You Know Dana? Dane is really fucking fair. Dan is very fair. No, he listened to Anthony. I think ms dot wait three times. Yes, and that's 12 pounds over that.

Speaker 1:          00:20:58       Well, he had a medical situation this time. I mean you can't. He. She was cutting too much, but he had a medical situation this time where he. His legs stop working. Right? I heard that. Which is fucking crazy. It really stop and think these guys get down to that dehydrated state and then rehydrate up and fight the next day. I mean it's. Someone needs to talk to that dude and say, listen man, you got it. You don't need to put on any more muscle. Okay. What you need to do is just lose some of them. Also. You got legit. Don't need to be that big. You're a fucking monster. Loose some of it. You're going to fight it. One 85. You should walk around no bigger than one 95. Really? You really shouldn't be cutting that much weight. You're a super athlete. He's like totally selling himself short by dehydrating himself and draining himself for these fights.

Speaker 1:          00:21:45       So when it gets in like grueling fights, like the cost check five, he gets tired, the vituro fight, he gets tired. Man, I'm awesome. Burns a lot. But when burns even more is when you dehydration, hydrate the fuck out of your body, you know, I id hydrated my body when I fought and taekwondo tournament. So I did that to make way when I fought it when I was in like 16, I was fighting at 1:40 and I didn't weigh 1:40 and I didn't do it right either. I would just like take hot showers and take hot baths and not drink any water for like a day. And then I'd weigh in and I have to rehydrate and fight that day. And I know what it feels like. It's a terrible feeling. It makes you feel like shit to stupid thing. I mean I did it because it was an idiot because I, you know, and I was being instructed that I should stay in that weight class.

Speaker 1:          00:22:27       He's got 50 fucking pounds to cut. He. So the month before that. Not only that dude, he's so fucking big fucking pounds. It is. Muslims, a lot of it's muscle mass, muscle mass. He's a super athlete. That fucking guy, man could be fighting it to look bad. Pick on what's going on with the fucking pickles. And uh, and the other thing. Oh, olive garden. Ocean Boulevard, ocean. God. Now who the fuck joey. When is the last time you blew your wide bullets? What do you mean? Gambling or just whacked? Whacked off. And who the fuck knows guy off the hump? Pillows. Do you take time? No, I work well from time to time. The shower a couple of minutes here and there or something. I'd bang one out in my cappuccino style. Does Chaz Bono have the Dick now? Probably. I mean I haven't asked her, you know, coffee being I'll say just show me that fucking pickled. It's really crazy that she, you know, she had a girlfriend and they broke up, but you know, the girlfriend was like, she had a girlfriend and she was a girl and then she decided she was a man. And then the girl like, could you imagine like if you're a lesbian and then all sudden the person that you're with becomes a man. That's the best revenge ever. This, that's the best route. You know, I'll get back at, you know, and she'll get a couple of girlfriends. She'll get a couple of girlfriends. Novelty. It's a

Speaker 3:          00:23:45       novelty. Oh my God. There. Yeah. And then you take them home and a dick. Smells like a Twat. And then you're saying you will see after you ran three miles, what's the difference that Dick and I meet the fucking monkey here. You know what the difference? You can't take away the smell it. You know, you can't put a fake dick on. It ain't going to fucking pants. They make balls. Yeah, they do. They do. I mean they make neoprene balls or something that, let's say you have little balls are big balls and you could listen if you get anything. She's switching to real patois. We could change around just because, you know, I think that I like fucking Doris Day music and one day I want to be a woman. It just, I think that's a little bit more than that. I think that it's just a little bit fucking more than that.

Speaker 3:          00:24:32       Yeah, it's. I'm not against it. I don't know. The guy who does a is a, is a guy that lives in Colorado. The busiest guy look him up is a guy that lives in southern Colorado and he doesn't mind the weekends. He's booked eight years in advance and really he has a regular job during the week. I don't want to quote it. We've talked about this before. You have to look it up. It was on 60 minutes and then the weekends he does the operations. He's booked three years in advance, I think during the week. He's like a farmer or aphasia assumptions. Fucking crazy. And on the weekends he cut your fucking Dick off and puts that fucking monkey that, that chicken we met in Vegas with the artificial turf and the fucking holes that time. Remember Riviera's member reviewing. The security came and tapped. As you're talking to a fucking Javier, get confused and you know what, if I have had a couple bumps in me, I will let that thing suck. My Dick wasn't that bad without official turf monkey and shit. You Finger Bang that in the whole lighter.

Speaker 3:          00:25:33       Julie's said Jodi and said, it looks like a bat. What? Oh my God. It was the ugliest fucking thing you had ever seen and it just freaked you out. Like you just don't want to eat no more like you didn't want to drink like none. It was going to take away the pain and they're much better at doing it now. Apparently now they can construct a pretty realistic looking vagina. The point where it really fucks people up. We'll fucking fucking cups with a vagina on it will fucking cups. Flashlight is a cup with a fucking vagina on it that you know, whatever feels it doesn't go cocktails. You don't know what you're fucking dude's some dudes. Men have no problem like having sex with a, a. he's like a girl that used to be a guy as long as it's a girl now she's a guy.

Speaker 3:          00:26:17       Girl. Man, she's a girl, man, I ain't got no problem with that. Like there's dudes that will tell you they have no problem with that. They think that it's a girl, but there's other dudes just like, listen, when you're drunk and it's four in the fucking morning, alright, and you're driving on Santa Monica and you haven't gotten your Dick Sucked and 60, 70, 80 days. All right. And you're driving, you're fucked up and you got to gram a blow in your pocket. That chick with the blonde hair becomes whatever you want it. You pull over and do a couple lines and had that fucking monster suction pipe. Why? There's no, it's happening. I know it's happened. It's had no, I'm just going for broke tonight and fuck it. And after she sucked your Dick, you just make a quick fucking turn and throw out of the car and you drive home and hope there's no fucking satellites around taking cameras.

Speaker 3:          00:27:02       What are you going to do? What the fuck are you going to do? Some dudes, it becomes a utility thing. It's like you can't get rid of this stuff. Absolutely. I bet that this guys out there that is so fucking crazy on it that they don't even care until they come and it's like anything else. How many times have you started whacking off and all the sudden you start thinking of women that think those suck your Dick, but after you crack that nut, you just put your phone down. I already cracked my neck. I'm going to put up with that crazy bits talking nonsense. You know what I'm saying? I just, I just wiped myself off the debt deal. I need this shit. You're projecting. It's true. I would never come if I don't come in in a certain amount of time that I'm not going to go to a tranny tranny.

Speaker 3:          00:27:45       Just looking at a training makes me sick. Like when you make that right turn. I'm fucking Santa Monica and you go up highland or Libretto. The best is if you get up early in the morning, like you have to go somewhere to the airport and you take love bread down five in the morning, right? Man, I don't think they'll have brand Santa Monica. There's 20 of them and let me tell you something. I'm here to tell you a man that I am. I don't. You can't fucking tell to you pulled over it until you pull over and look at them. You don't know, and by that time you're 50 percent. There was a dude who was an Iraqi vet, picked up a hooker, came back from Iraq, picked up a hooker, hooker, blows them, finds out the hookers or guy, shoot some cops, see him, dumped the body out of his car. High speed chase that go to the desert. He jumps out of the car with the gun suicide by cop. Wow. Oh, because he couldn't deal with the fact that the dude sucked his dick. So you had to kill the guy. If he just let that guy go and laughed it off. What a fucking story. Who would have been a great story?

Speaker 3:          00:28:51       It was one of us. You can be at parties and be like, tell him about that time that sucked your Dick. All right, come on over. I'm going to just tell it. I'll tie the bitch up and call you guys and we'll do a podcast with him. Nobody believe it. Listen, Joe Rogan. Listen you. You stopped. You're at a bar. You pick up a girl that you think you bring it home. You go between the legs and she's got a nine inch fucking cock. Let me, because most of those trainees always have the biggest fuck. Tranny ain't going to have a two inch Dick. They always got a rope between their fucking legs. So you don't think right there when you grabbed that laugh, Joe Rogan. No, I'd be dangerous. I'd felt like I was in danger because I was like, I got tricked. I feel like I'm getting tricked and if you get tricked and all of a sudden the trick turns out to be a man.

Speaker 3:          00:29:39       That's a dangerous situation when you're alone with a man. So now you've got to wonder what the fuck you gotta fight. You gotta. Find out if that person's violent. You got to find out that person's apologetic. You got to find out if that person just fucked up with a gun in your hand. All of these things. I'm going to find that I'm a fine. It's upstairs. I'll be ready. I'm going to shove it up. Your rest. I'm going to come back with that nine millimeter at gunpoint. You miserable cock. Sucker. Gumby the fucking truth. How long have you been doing this? Something. We've got to do something here. We just can't let you just. You're not going to laugh it off. It's crazy. Would shoot him. You think you'd tell them something? I got to kick him in the stomach. I got to do something.

Speaker 3:          00:30:19       Something's getting a beating. We got to do something. I'm calling my friends fluffed up. I fucked up. I picked up this chicken. Grab a pussy in it. She had a bigger Dick than me. What do I do in the morning? Monica Boulevard. Would you shoot him if he had the gun on you guys succeed? Do it. Would it be just get the fuck out of my car or would it be bad? Now you threw money at car. Think of that feeling you're going to have. That has to be the worst feeling you're going to get back in your car. You're going to crash your car against the fucking wall, the one 90, because you can't believe this just happened to you. Whenever you do five minutes after you find that this person is. It's legal. I can sell that in court. I could sell that and caught a lumps.

Speaker 3:          00:31:03       Let's break it down. Forget the turn. This is dog and a man. You ever want to crack a fucking nut? Late night and a blind heels. She stuck shit. Dick and you go for that monkey. There's a two foot fucking cock. There's three minutes of blackout time right there. Let's get a little conference. The attorneys, how long did he do? Did he bring her home and shoot shooter? If you shoot it within four or five minutes, this temporary insanity. Think of water is going to feel like you're right. I don't know if he could call a temporary insanity. You wouldn't get. You wouldn't get life. You don't know that. It means it might've. It might've been some sort of an assault situation, so the car as well. We don't know when he confronted them. It could have been that the guy attacked him first and then he got pulled his gun out.

Speaker 3:          00:31:44       I mean, he's probably freaked. Well, who the fuck knows? We're just totally SPEC. I'll tell you. That was a soldier and Iraqi soldier came back. I mean all this guy had to do was pull over and tell the cops, well first let me talk to you. What happened? Let me tell you what really happened to us. I'm a little horn in my country and some guy just suck my dick and I shot him. What do you think? We're going to let this go. Still get some. They don't ever let it go. When someone shoots somebody listening, you get to good cops in the right mood. One of them just got, the other one's got a brother who's gay and you don't like thanksgiving. You know what I'm saying? And also what some guy sucked your Dick. We feel for you. Get back in the car. We'll just wrap this up. Let somebody find. I think a guy would. That might've happened in the sixties, but nowadays, well now, because you got the. Yes. Yeah. Back in the day, cops were the only ones that were able to talk

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       and make a decision. Right then they can be. Yeah, they could be in the car with a little, you know, one out of 12, 1:00 AM 12, and we're closing a suspect. Now you've got cameras. You can't do nothing, but still. Joe, let me talk to you on this side. It's a quarter to 12. We've got this Puerto Rican chick that wants to suck my dick. She likes when I come over with my gun holster around. This guy just killed the training. We've got no paperwork here. Is that what it is? Sure. That's. You know, he doesn't matter, Joe. You still have to account for a murder. That's the problem with your theory, but he'll have to account for a guy was shot a guy. Understand this. You have a suspect that have it all wrapped up. Are you thinking of with them and tell the court the truth.

Speaker 1:          00:33:14       You get off of involuntary man's want to do six years. They cut that in half. You're out of that and a couple fucking months really, and you got to shoot somebody and have some fun and get your degree three years to shoot somebody and get your Dick sucked. Let's a lot of fun. That shoots and the smell. The gunpowder in prison food was really bad. Oh, it's terrible. But you've got a good attorney and negotiate it down. Do you remember cafeteria food like in college or high school? It's just like horrible. Fucking horrible. It's like a different. It's like Mcdonald's fit prison. Have you seen this new bill they're trying to pass now. That would make make it possible to strip anybody have citizenship if they a proposed a threat to America. They're American citizens. Yeah, I heard about that. It snuck in. Got It.

Speaker 1:          00:33:56       Yeah. So what are you going to take it back to? It's like the keep. I don't know. They're going to kick you out of the country. They keep coming up with crazier and crazier fucking things. It's like this is the year of like total complete control. Like they're trying to control the Internet, that trying to control this national defense authorization act. They're trying Sopa and Pipa, all this different shit that's going on. It's like the control is getting tighter and tighter and tighter and when you hear shit like this, like they want to be able to strip people of their citizenship like what the fuck? Like Mexico or somewhere that'll take you. I mean there's a few countries that will just take. Yeah, that seems like illegal. Like worldwide. It's possible. This is the strangest time in my life of, of like watching the government and watching all these people scrambled to try to get into position.

Speaker 1:          00:34:49       Like this is a weird time, man. This, this feels so bizarre. I never thought I would see something like that. Like someone writing something down like that, like that. You should be able to have the power to kick people out of the country if somehow or another they do something to harm America, but that's, you know how ridiculous that is. No one's harming America. They're coming up all these fucking crazy laws and the ability to detain people, but what is really happening here? Nothing. Nothing's happening in America. Nothing. The only thing that's happening is that people are saying they're not happy with the current government. That's the only action that's happening in the whole country. It's not like there's some fucking crazy thing going on where we're being constantly attacked by terrorists and we have to figure out how to defend ourselves and an ever changing world. Now there's fucking terror attacks

Speaker 6:          00:35:38       and I don't say they're. They're catching them all. I don't really think there's that many terrorists out there. I don't really think there's that many people that fucking hate us and I think that number would be substantially less if we weren't occupying another fucking countries, but the bottom line is they're coming up with all these, these does this, these laws that are set up to control us and to shackle us, to put us down in there protecting us from what these laws are for what? Where is this threat? Where's this threat in our country that you need to create these laws will. The only threat is to the power that be. That's the only threat. The powers that be are the only ones who are being threatened. That's it. It's not like we have to worry about terrorist attacks, you know? That's a fucking. That's a bullshit thing, man.

Speaker 6:          00:36:21       There's not that many fucking terrorists. There's not that many. Yeah, there are some and yeah, there are plots and yes, some are legit, but did the laws that they're coming up with band, they're not doing this to protect us from terrorism. They're doing this to make it harder for people to get up and protest. That's what the fuck they're doing. It says this a spooky, spooky time to watch this shit go down. It's like this is everything. They warned us about the founding fathers. This is. This is everything. Benjamin Franklin said, this is bizarre. It's like they predicted it. They predicted that one day there would become a point of ultimate corruption. You have to do everything you can and keep these pieces in place in order to avoid that. Ultimately

Speaker 3:          00:37:03       corruption is communist. To read deep communism is government isn't three d water, like they come on your computers posts that pull you over and take your fucking asked you for an id and I understand your protectiveness, but again, protecting us from how much money you got. Middle America running fucking scared would see in the media running scared, you know, and, and they don't know, they really don't fucking know that. They're scaring us into giving us us giving up our rights. Yeah. They want us to do, give us our fucking rights by scaring us. Well, if you don't let me fuck an x ray, you'll, we can't catch a fucking whatever. If you know, it's always something. These fall laws, it's always fucking something every week. Well, you know, there's a lot of people that believe that the government would have tried some sort of a false flag event.

Speaker 3:          00:37:56       You know, the false flag event is an event that like they'll do something on purpose in order to get us to realize, whoa, there's a threat we need to like beef up the law. And that's like shit that they've pulled since the beginning of time. But there's a lot of people that don't believe they can do that today. They think that it's too easy. The access to information is just too easy to spread and that with the Internet it's so difficult to control things. They don't think they could do it. What happened to the occupy movement? I didn't believe I was still going on when everyone, olive garden they occupy or where the fuck are these people? Where the fuck are they protesting against American airline with a $20 dollar luggages when people, American Airlines,

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       everybody's paying the 20 foot of luggage were all these. I don't think money would have occupied. That's back Merrigan airline luggage thing I can on every day for that fly southwest or I fucking loved it. I thought to take. For me, I think that all we got to do is bring pathways. Corporations back to the United States. I don't care if you want to open up something of what. You got to open up one here too. You've got to pay taxes for this one and then do whatever the fuck you want in Beijing with Hindus or whatever the fuck you want to do. And that's what's killed Middle America. They've left Pittsburgh. There's no more manufacturing. Well, that's what I, that's what I want back. You know, we can have some fucking job. We've talked about this before, but like ipods, like a or a, you know, an iphone.

Speaker 1:          00:39:25       I would pay, I would pay like double the amount of money for a Karma free iphone. There was more, you know, that American workers is what it would cost. Yeah, I heard that. But you know, here are the, here's the problem with that logic, the minerals, the minerals to make those phones. You have to get an Africa and you've seen how they get those minerals. Man, that's, that's at the end of the most complicated shit that we have. Technology at its root is a kid in Africa working in a fucking mind, pulling shit out of the ground with a piece of metal and a stick. I mean, it's, it's, it's as, as base as you can get, child fucking slavery in Africa, making, extracting minerals is super common. You know, it's, it's, you know, they had that advice special. Well they did on it when they went to the Congo and watch these guys and it's um, it's, it's weird to think that that's the only way you could do that.

Speaker 1:          00:40:19       The only way you can get those minerals is you've got to go there. That's where they're at. But, and you know, their, their sense of I want to have kids just so I have them doing chores because I don't want to have a made in my house. But it seems like when I was young I had to like clean the living room. Went to once a time. And that's kind of like having your kid being a child labor, you know, like you're making them clean your house chores, children, responsibility rooms, scrub bathrooms because kids have to have responsibility, learn to contribute. I am happy my parents made me do chores because it taught me how to work hard. Father taught me how to just hit it off and fucking work hard. I think my parents took advantage of me and I was mowing lawns and shit and then I'm like, looking back on man, I need that in my life right now. I need to have kids just to clean this place up because I'm tired of doing it. I'm not sure how the fuck that works with child labor in Africa on phones. I'm not sure how you made that connection because it's like making kids work. Like you can kiss world of your own body. His work helping out and contributing it at home is not working. My mother used it. It's fucked up man. What's up? My mother used to work. Make me fucking. I might stop the empty

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       the tampon things. Lindemann's fucking bathroom at my mother's bar when I was sick and put ice cubes in the fucking urinals and fucking stuck to the ice cube. So it doesn't splatter back at you or is it just to make clay gamed it. My Dad was an architect so most of my jobs and I got summer jobs and shit. It was always on construction sites, so I've worked like real jobs. I had some real construction jobs and especially, you know, after I graduated I had some that went through the winter. We worked outside in the winter. Once you know, it's no, those are real jobs. Those are my best days in Colorado. Flat roofs back. I'm in the dead of the winter. One day I took a shit in a bag and crunched it up and gave it to one of the workers and told them it was a brown.

Speaker 3:          00:42:20       Like 10 minutes later he's like, this brown. It smells like shit. We're fucking. I used to be a fucking roof and estimating ruth. When I got out of prison, I was in the halfway house. I was an estimator for, but I started out as a fucking bloating the roofs in boulder, Colorado in January and snow and you got to get up there and shovel the snow. Then cut it and throw it in and then. Aw, Geez. We used to build Igloos to fucking put rubber down on the roofs. That's fucking crazy. Well, they work. That's the thing about you still build Igloos. What do you mean? Right, so let's say you have to lay down a 40 squares of rubber that day with ballasted with rocks. We would shovel the roof at after the fucking shoveling. We laid the insulation down, but it was snowing, so three labors will be cutting the roof and the other three were building poles with a cover so the snow wouldn't land on the insulation so we'd have to build shit when it's.

Speaker 3:          00:43:18       No, it was like a New Jersey and New York City, which is the biggest metropolitan city. They get six inches of snow in the city closes down. I thought he was like blocking ice and making like Colorado. They get a foot of snow and you're at work at eight. Oh, one second. Another day of business. You can't say, well my bus came late because it didn't come late. Bitch. That motherfucker came on time. They'd been driving in the snow for 20 years. There's no. I'm 10 minutes late because there was snow in Colorado. It ever is. He knows really impressive. We were in Montreal in December and it was cold as fuck, but man, that airport was smooth there. De Icing. They had that shit down pat. Then model allowing, plowing the. They were plowing the runways and cleaning everything needed runway. Yeah. So they just really fucking amazing. Amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:44:03       Yeah. They avoid a lot of bullshit. They plan well for the, for the cold up there. It's an. Yeah, they do in Colorado too. They really do. In the suburbs, you like, it snowed a foot and the fucking guy came by with the plow and he did it. It's over. It's over in the bigger cities, like it snows in three days, you know, fucking crazy shit isn't me. Hearing about like the mountains getting like seven feet, like every now and then they'll get a snow dog, but seven feet of snow will fall on the. I don't think people even understand

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       what the fuck that means. I've prepared. If you're not going anywhere, you're not going anywhere for a week. At least. I hit the. I hit the 1983. If you could get a minute. I hit the 1983 blizzard, which was 24 days in a row of snow, anywhere from two inches to two feet, but it didn't matter. It didn't matter. It was snow every day. So you pretty much went home and you know, got up to Thanksgiving blizzard. Oh Ha. That's what Colorado is known for. They say that Colorado gets blizzard. It's always like around Thanksgiving or Halloween. One or the other. The other one of the early. Just to remind you, bitch put away the, you know what I'm saying? Like don't get too comfortable with your shorts and itchy. Like in September, my sister was born in the blizzard of [inaudible] 78 in Ohio and they had to take a helicopter, had to go to my parents' house and pick her up my mom up to have to really. Holy Shit. How much was that fucking helicopter ride?

Speaker 1:          00:45:33       One of the biggest snow storms to ever hit a major city in the u. The thanksgiving blizzard. Nineteen 83. Cairo. Yeah. Particular Blizzard just wanted a whole series of storms and blew through the country over a two week period. So something happened in like a weather pattern got stuck over there or something. Oh, it was it Joe Rogan and it wasn't. I remember looking at the sky, how the sky looked like. You could still see the moon and the fucking morning, like at five in the morning and you could still see the moon and the sun's coming out the same time with that haze. It's just fucking beautiful mountain. How long did it take before people could move around? Twenty minutes. No, no, no, no. After the blizzard. Like how long before people could drive around 20 minutes. No, come on Bro. It's Colorado, you know, seven feet of snow.

Speaker 1:          00:46:21       How the fuck? Oh, you know, I mean it's, it's snowing and people live in their life. You know what I'm saying? They're just known and it's adding up and you're still living your life. You're like, well, we've got a foot of snow and sudden you go in, you look out at midnight, honey, I got to put my shoes on. I had to go back out there and shovel. And you know, it was one of those that I've read that they've gotten seven feet of snow in some areas, but my brain won't let me believe that my brain, my brain is going shut up. That's over a car. Well, that's seven fucking feet. Seven feet of snow. It's not real. That's fun. Is the most the deepest snow that has ever been recorded? Like the deepest snow for. Let's find out what is the deepest. I don't think it's here either. Would you think might be in the United States? The most amount of snowfall in the morning? Yeah. I don't think it would be in the United States somewhere. What's the deepest snow fall in the United States? Oh Shit. It's a race between typing 19, 93. Storm of the century. The total snowfall. Twelve feet. Oh my God. What? Twelve point nine slash 10 feet. Hold on. It's like a storm of the century. 90 three superstar. But the

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       buzzard, 1993, the east coast, North America, blah, blah, blah blah blah,

Speaker 2:          00:47:37       uh,

Speaker 3:          00:47:37       killed. Three hundred and 10 people. What is the most snow and a storm ever bought whole? I loved the navy. Threes is Christ snowdrifts are as high as 35 fee and that's a drift.

Speaker 3:          00:47:59       You see some wild shit living up there and spin off a Ajax. You see some fucking drips. You know I'm going to Riverton, Wyoming and all that. Like my buddies used to jump off a helicopter and land in the snow and they'd say that it had to be 20 feet of fucking snow onto them. You imagine that just jumping on a helicopter 20 feet and landing. It's snowy. Oppose that James Bond Shit. That's crazy. Crazy shit. Take you up there with. There's no lifts. There's no. Oh my God. Yes. And you just go down and you don't know what time do you those videos, whatever. I watched those videos, those extreme sports videos of guys jumping out of helicopters are the fucking snowboard and going down the side of a mountain that's minus won't be taken place on Avatar. There might be this, you might as well be doing some silver surfer shit.

Speaker 3:          00:48:43       You know, I can't even believe I'm sharing the planet with you like you're a crazy person. You're doing like you're. You live in the nuttiest suicide like, oh, I'm just having a massive confidence in their ability to surf and ski and I guess the rush of it is so spectacular. They're willing to take the risk of dying. People die all the time. People just. Somebody just died the other day. Girl. Yeah, she, I think she was doing some crazy sort of a jump though. Our. Yeah, those are really dangerous men. If you're fucking ski jumping, you're flying through the air and you're hoping you're going to land perfectly on this fucking slope and everything's all slippery. Like Valentines, we can ask when I was telling you that that's one of the lower, the lowest point of moistures India, so people ski with Bikini's on February.

Speaker 3:          00:49:27       What they do is they build a ramp and snowmass village. People ski down with Bikinis and do a loop de loop over a fucking pool swimming pool and people do it all the time and you're like, oh my God. Like I couldn't have. Even I, I was just happy skin going, you know, I'm like a green fucking blow up or something. I was just happy not jumping and shit like that, but sometimes I would ski and pick up momentum and I just crashed just to stop Joe Rogan. That's how fast you go on those fucking skis. I'm telling you the truth. I'm telling you the truth. I don't give a fuck what anybody tells you. When I first started skiing the first season, I wasn't too good at stopping. I always do the plows and I would just take our fucking ski lines. I would just take him to fuck off because I had no choice.

Speaker 3:          00:50:07       I would just put my head down and go in there like, fuck jerome bettis. People get hurt. That wouldn't hurt. And that's tornado season. My second season I started planning a little better and I got better, but this time. So you pick them up some speed and you're like, Whoa, wait a second. Let's. I would just fall. Remember when it killed Sonny Bono, man? Yeah. That was a fucking tree that. That's. That happens. That happens. You just gained. You hit something. You Ski, twist to the jungle one. Oh Damn. That's how you come up with the skill. That was when I learned about coolness. Does anybody ski with a helmet on? I would. What'd you? Yeah. I mean I used to ski with like a big Michelin man out, big nerf outfit. Like that's when I learned about coolness. I taught coolness was being in New York in the village and smoking a joint.

Speaker 3:          00:50:54       No, no, no, no. When you go skiing and you get in that fucking gambling, there's six people and they looked like your grandpa and all of a sudden somebody comes over and goes, do you mind if for a spark up a joint? And you're like, are you fucking so really the spark of the Gondolas give you mushrooms are joints. You don't know who you. People go skiing to the doctors and go, look, we can't get high in Minneapolis, but we're going to get high and we go to ask me will try and it would do and it was doing mushrooms. I spent as a kind of a crazy town. It's very, it's weird that there's so many rich people that live in Aspen. Like I remember being in Aspen going, how are they affording all these houses? Like these are just gigantic, multi, multi, multimillion dollar houses all over the place and the stores are all at the highest end stores.

Speaker 3:          00:51:39       How many people actually live up there though? It all winter. It's mostly winter. A lot. The summer's a fucking beautiful and aspen and you got to remember, this is the sick thing about aspen. Visa are their second homes. These are their winter homes. They close them up and put a. The Guy I house sat for, it was the owner of the. He was on the board of Tgi Friday and this was one of his eight houses and he would only use it one week a year. Jesus. And he wanted you to live in the house. So when he came to town there was no dilemmas guide. Four bedrooms. I undo the speedometer on his fucking jeep. I was living in Montana. I Jacuzzi inside, outside. He had an apartment over the garage. That's common, right? That people hire a coach, hire a caretaker, and all my job was 20 hours a month, so it was either 20 hours of mowing the lawn or 20 hours of shoveling snow or both 20 and it was, that's it.

Speaker 3:          00:52:32       I wasn't much and so what he would just call you when he's coming into town, you will call me and say I'm coming in December 14th to the 28th and you would just start cleaning it up and I would clean up my side of the house and I had everything stashed and says his side of the house. I had an office and inside of the House and scales up there, I had everything. Really? Yeah. He had one, two, three, five bedrooms and outside Jacuzzi inside Jacuzzi. And he had. So even when he was there, you were still staying there? I would stay in the garage over the. He had an apartment he built that was beautiful cable. Everything at so I would stay there and then when he only for that one week and then I was only a cat take off in his bed, I'd fucked up.

Speaker 3:          00:53:13       I've done everything in this fucking house. I had the keys to the cabinets because what you do is you put all your stuff in a particular cabinet and lock it. So if you rent it out of your friends come to visit, they don't find what your shit. Right. That's what you do. So. But I had the keys to that so I'd make my fucking. He had pounds of elk and venison up there. Really, you know, he was a hunter up there so it was an amazing fucking gate. But that was part of his thing. Use everything, use everything. I don't want to come to town and have to, you know, I don't want the sink to be broken because your trees. Right, right, right. He's like I need you in the house taking a shower. And he got, you know, at that time it was stated a fucking out the house.

Speaker 3:          00:53:50       Yeah. You have to live in it for 35 fall way road. I snorted more fucking blow and eight more snatching that fucking house and I seen some creepy. I never been in there with a couple one night and I like, I met them at the bar, like I knew her from the cheesecake and they have the cheesecake store. There wasn't a cheesecake factory. It was 1984 and I invited them over and, and, and I went to change and she was naked and I was like, what the fuck is. She goes, what are you thinking? My tits. I remember we all went back into the Jacuzzi and then at like five in the morning, he was a baker at a poll of fronts. I don't know if they're still there and he left. They both left and then she called me and said, come get me.

Speaker 3:          00:54:29       And I went over, picked her up, brought her back to the Jacuzzi. I had the weirdest fucking things happen in Aspen. The weirdest sex things. That's a crazy fucking town because it's like anywhere else. When people come up there for a week, they want to fucking suck. You know? People want to get lost and the people that would kill up there were people from Texas. I will spend millions up there. I went to one of those bars, one of the local bars with one of the agents when we had the, the Aspen comedy festival. I remember that when they hit the Hbo Festival. And uh, I was with his agent and he goes, you see these girls? See that girl, that girl, that girl? I go, yeah, he goes, those are all hookers, thousand and nine. I was like, what thousand dollars? They just go to bars and like they just wait and they're hookers like they come into town.

Speaker 3:          00:55:14       Apparently he was saying that some of them know, like when during ski season that there's a lot of wealthy men, thousand and nine. That's incredible. So they come in and they like hunt and this is their hunting ground. That's amazing. They got a job on the lift to the immediate sugar daddy and then it's all low really? Or they just go up there to hookup and Aspen. It's amazing. It's amazing. It's amazing. There's so much dough up and there's so many crazy. I remember going up there when I talked to get there, I left and I left New York City and the peak of New York City and I went to Aspen. They weren't missing a beat. There was a bar named Patty bugattis that had a swimming pool in the middle, was hard with the swim right in the middle. That's awesome. So you could swim while you were drinking.

Speaker 3:          00:55:57       Get coked up people and they with their clothes. Makeup. This was asking in 83. [inaudible] 83. I asked him was the cocaine capital of the country because there was so much money up. That's where Miami vice was in Glen Fry and you creek and Sidney Poitier. Michael Douglas. You just seen people come in. Elizabeth Tale. I seen a. what's the name once the flying nun, that bad ass bitch. That chick that was hanging out with burt reynolds for awhile. Oh, sally. Sally, finance bitch. At that time with her brown and a metcon, Charles Bronson was up there running shit for awhile. When I first moved to Aspen, they had Katie la was only one channel and all they did was play Mr. Majestic, isn't it hard to get into aspen though? Like the flying isn't a difficult flight. Well they don't land in there at night after 8:00 or something. They got strict rules. But now you could fly to aspen from la direct real. In the old days it was just Denver and Colorado Springs or not. And if you, like I told you, if you fly into aspen as you're flying over woody creek, there's a guy that dumped his wife that was a stewardess. So he painted a finger on his roof. So when you fly over asking the daytime, there's always a roof the fucking finger on it because his wife was a stewardess for one of the airlines.

Speaker 3:          00:57:12       Woody creek is a very. I seen, I remember being a kid and a Conoco on, at the, uh, old snowmass border. There was a conical that the guys were from New York and when you went into that New York time and Colorado time. But I know that seeing Kurt Ruffling Goldie Hawn with those fucking kids being kids, like I didn't know. I didn't know she was the girl from fucking. I didn't know she was going to be a star. There were kids at Conoco and that Conoco see at that time in Colorado it was all retired drug dealers. Right. So the feds were up there big time. So in old snowmass they had this drug dealer so the feds fucking put cameras around his house, but they didn't know how to do with that. So it came up on people's Cable TV. So people on cable going, hey bro, you're on Channel Four, you know you're cooking eggs, aren't you?

Speaker 3:          00:58:00       And he's like, how do you know? He sued the government. Wow. Full fucking millions for an. I mean Aspen's got some wild fucking shit. There's a guy look him up, Steven Gray Ball, he got caught with $8,000,000. Joe Rogan, December of 83, December of 84. He was 30 days away from staying, standing drop and they blew them up with a pipe bomb at the Aspen club when he was working out. And that was the only night he didn't pay somebody that started his fucking car. They blew them up with a fucking pipe bomb in the city of Aspen. Which an 83, there wasn't even a fucking Spanish person up there. It was just nice white people. Jesus Christ, his first sentence, despite its reputation as a city that never sleeps, thanks to the copious consumption of chemical stimulants, aspen has seen relatively few large scale drug busts. Wow. So they're just doing drugs up in Aspen.

Speaker 3:          00:58:58       This is a fucking terrible comments. You come in with the government, you come and listen to fucking jail and aspen don't got a kitchen. That's the only on the country that don't have a kitchen. They get that food catered. So you get muffins for breakfast and tea and really? Yeah. That's why bundy escaped from there. How do you think these people fucking escape from there? What? They use the phone and climbed the fucking window. Aspen, Colorado. When I was there, some guy shot a guy with a machine gun and a coke party shot. I'm going to machine gun. They had the guy fishing. They take good a fishing trips in the summer down there. Fucking roaring fork thing. They take your fish and they take the prisoners. I went to prison. The biggest thing I wanted to go to the rifle because they gave you a job as a lifeguard in the city, so they use the prisoners, is lifeguards and they gave you a job in the movie theater in rifle.

Speaker 3:          00:59:46       I ended up at Camp George West, but I really wanted to go to rifle, which is on the other side of the hill. Asman. It's like an hour for Massman, but in the wintertime they had worked for because you took over the city that prisoners, but it's fucking aspen has no fucking kitchen, my friend. That's ridiculous. And they still get food catered for them. What is there like a lot of shit out there though. It just. This is sort of when I give you that fact is people twitted me right now going, Joe, you an asshole. I'm telling you in 1983, if you look at Colorado was the cocaine capital of the country because Colorado's right in the middle of the country. At that time, Mexico, we weren't using Mexico, so it was Miami and everything got shipped to Colorado and from Colorado went to Minneapolis, Seattle, California, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 3:          01:00:32       Everybody's waiting for something in California. Everybody's waiting for you. In California and Colorado. It's a bunch of fucking guys. Would horses at the airport helping you carry the coconut to the plane? Can I help you with that? They're helping you. It's a very mystique type of fucking city. At the top of this. It's Glenwood Springs. Snowmass village. Woody Creek and asked and sits on the fucking top. Dude. This is the whole story. Nineteen eight. The grable case. They were. Yeah. They didn't tell us about how he was blown up and above a bomb placed in a borrowed car that he drove to the Aspen Club for a tennis. What the fuck you think you're dealing with here? Joy. Bananas. I'll drop it on and if and if I'm right, it was December twelfth or December something. December 1980. Fuck you think you're dealing with it? A bomb in a borrowed car as he drove to the Aspen Club for a tennis match.

Speaker 3:          01:01:18       Could you imagine all this fucking Aspen Heights, but listen to me showing up at their tennis outfits on and Mercedes and pulling into the driveway and his fucking car blows up. I listened to these numbers. He was making $6 million every six weeks. After two or three years he was making so much money. He was a Jewish kid that went to Miami, University of Miami to get a degree and ended up hanging out with Cubans and Colombians and that was it. They made him a white guy. They just said, you're going to control the west coast. And he was making 6 million every six weeks. Couldn't even can cleanse it fast enough so he would come into your restaurant and go, Joe Rogan, I'm going to give you 25,000 cash. Call me when it's over. So he would go to every restaurant in this area and give him 25 grand and go do me a favor.

Speaker 3:          01:02:03       Call me when it's over. So I'm just going to come in and eat every day. Just tell me when they're 25 grand and the quicker the better. Like if I come in here for three hotdogs, told me the 25 is gone, you're doing me a favor. So when they busted him, they just didn't bust him. If you read the story that went to these businesses, you know that there's a movie that they did years later. That was his story where he had safe set all the restaurants where you would come to your restaurant. I'm going to give you 25 grand a month. They usually tell me when it's over, but I'm going to put a safe in the back. And he started putting some. When the feds came up there, they found a million, 2 million. All these things. My come to Denver, he couldn't even wash the money fast enough.

Speaker 3:          01:02:41       They took them to Denver and Denver. The feds go, go back to the fucking house because there's still another 10 million that we haven't found. We've been listening to him. So they went back to the house, couldn't find it, couldn't find it. He had hidden in a garbage can. Fill with leaves outside. How the feds got them, what they were gone and taken his garbage and they were looking at his paperwork so the feds will come every morning and take his garbage and look at the figures he would do. They did it from the scrapping. So all the little figures you do a rip up that all that Shit. That's how they nailed them. So they waited a fucking year til he was 30 days away from sentencing in this beautiful white suburban town above Aspen, Colorado. And on a Sunday night they fucking blew him up in a rented car.

Speaker 3:          01:03:26       Why you waiting? He had a borrowed car because at that point he had eight cars in his garage. Like he had cars everywhere. Couldn't trust any of them. He couldn't trust any of them. They knew. He knew that the, the, the, the Colombians weren't going to take it whether he talked to not. Why take the chance we're going to kill him. So he had bodyguards and I didn't. He didn't know that they put a fucking pipe bomb on them. That was Miami vice type shit. He went to Schottische car and he almost lived. But the pipe went up through his fucking ass and he almost bled to death. Yeah. Yeah. The pipe bomb went through him or something. Something weird. He bled out or something. He could have lived very interesting. Aspen, Colorado. Very interesting place. Jesus Christ. That's hilarious. Well, whenever you have drugs, you got to have violence.

Speaker 3:          01:04:09       Whenever you have people buying, buying massive amounts of coke or whatever the fuck they is it coke up there. This is where it gets better. He never seen it. What do you mean? He moved so much blow. He never even seen it. He didn't see the glow. He would go to the bank and get $500 worth of quarters a day. His whole day was just getting caught and they would drive three hours to a payphone and do all his business from a payphone. Really? He never waited. He never seen it. He never touched it. He just moved it. Go to Minneapolis, go to la, go to New Mexico. Jesus is the center, so he did it all from payphones, everything. Everything was from a payphone. $500 a day and they were watching them at the bank. They were watching them. They will want, you know, how big is asking you fight the whole fucking town from housing that's amid seven blocks or something. They blocked Galena street. Main Street. You don't have much up there. Are very big and he wasn't sanded up there. It wasn't like he was at bars at night. No, the guy was just. That's just where he was. He was just moving it across the country. Very interesting fucking story about. That's a hell of a network you put together to be able to accomplish that. One of the first guys ever Jewish guy.

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       What would it be like of cocaine? Was legal and knowing him knowing would have been super right. I'm the only one here that hasn't done it very bad. Very bad. If they want to legalize that shit, people go to pharmacies and shit. It's just. And it's. And it's a creepy thing when you're doing it and that's even creepier when you're not doing it. Yeah. You know when you see it now you're like, wow, is that how creepy guy was? Obvious Rv, somebody told me that the weed store that they went to a party yesterday and obviously the kitten didn't know it was not a cold party because they went to a football thing and the kid. I'm like, isn't that weird? When one person is doing it, they stick out that that's a weird feeling when you're talking to a dude in there coked up and they had.

Speaker 1:          01:05:59       They give off that weird unpredictable energy like, well I've got to get away from this guy. I can't even read this motherfucker. I don't know what he's doing and it's just they just, they come off off shifty looking around a lot and can't shut the fuck up. Constantly yapping. It's tough. Fucking afternoon. When you were talking about the largest snowfall, did you hear what the actual one is and this is ridiculous. It's a hundred and 41 feet in more than five days. What? Where's this? And it was in Alaska. Christ. How's that? Even possible. So what happens that just like covers the house and that's it. You Die, you die because no left. You're attracting like Tom and Jerry style where your windows shoveled out away quick enough. Yeah. What happens? You Die. Yeah. You pretty much lived off of whatever was in her house, I guess.

Speaker 1:          01:06:50       Yeah, but even then you don't have any air were where's your air coming in? You've got to get air. You have to make like a pipe using sticks and then all that snow melts. It's going to be a fucking river that's going to wash your house away. Yeah. That's crazy. Unless you start eating it. Maybe it was in a really rural area where nobody lives. Maybe that's why it's their subjects to such giant snow dumps and they just had 20 feet like last week or so feet. God Damn Jesus fucking Christ. Yeah. There's some spots in this world that are really hazardous. You could deal with some shit. That's the one thing. You live in California for a little while. People completely forget. They completely forget that there's nature to consider like everybody's been freaking out these last couple of days. The reason why this podcast started late is because some truck flipped over on the highway because nobody knows how to drive in the rain when it gets wet.

Speaker 1:          01:07:45       It's wet here and everybody just spazzes out and on top of it, the road is greasy as fuck because of the fact that it doesn't rain very often when it does rain, it brings up all that oil from people's cars and tires and all that and all the shit that's on the car that everyone has dirty cars or have film on the car that's, you know, whatever rinses off as well. Yeah. Wax and all kinds of other gem challenged chem trails. Uh, but there were so, so, you know, I saw God lose it last night and I was right behind him. He's got the here at 4:15 and it's a 25 minute ride from my house. I left at 3:00 on the clock as I was leaving and it was slow the whole way. And then as I got closer to seeing the helicopters, helicopters don't show for a little accident.

Speaker 1:          01:08:28       They show for something heavy duty. So it's a weird place. There's too many of us men, there's too many fucking people living in one place, so all we need is one thing to go wrong. I tell you, man, when I was in Ohio though, I don't give a shit because right now it's going to be 90 degrees Thursday and that that's worth it to me one way or here? No, here 90. I'm fucking Thursday. Yeah. I like people on the east coast right now. They call me and go, you're 65 today. Tomorrow Bitch. February is next month. Motherfucker call me February 15th when you fucking Bikini on February 15th. Pocket comedy. Valentine's Day. It's definitely harder to live in a place like that. It makes it just makes life harder. But Minneapolis this week, he's crazy. He's going to that house and his gangster, all that he's doing. He's doing a fucking scavenger hunt in the mall with.

Speaker 1:          01:09:18       With, with. I'm going to get a little piece of banana. Prayerful bump. That shit. I'm going to open it up. They don't play. They're not the same. Minnesota. They'll throw you in jail right next to Jesse. Fucking Ventura. Stop eating edibles because that fucking surgery. Yeah, you have to stop eating it because it just dog. I got. I fainted from reading the fucking paperwork. I fainted from reading. We've discussed this before. The needles or the blood. Really? I got to the fucking statured will. The sutures will include sutures that he's going to put sutures in my knee. I fainted coming out from under my titties. You know, you got lucky. So I said, you know what? I think I had an edible that day to last week. I smoked a little piece of hash and I read fucking. I went online just to prepare for surgery and I thought it would tell me what vitamins to take and I'm reading about this arthroscopic surgery and I went fucking down on my fucking office.

Speaker 1:          01:10:13       What exactly are they saying is wrong with your knee? Meniscus tear, a little bit of arthritis and a little system. The meniscus tearing. So they're going to extract the system. Then they're going to clean up the Nunez case. Yeah. That's not too bad. That's like six weeks and you're pretty close to 100 percent. You know, I uh, I waited, I waited six weeks, last time I did that and then was training six weeks later by Google swimming right afterwards just to bike is really good. Swimming is. Swimming is decent cook too. But what I like about a bike is that it's stationary, it's constant. You don't have to worry about side to side motion and you're just, you can just do it at a light pace where you're stimulating the tendons and the ligaments and the muscle tissue, but you're not really taxing the knee now. So you don't do it hard. It's basically your five minutes. Not even. Don't even start with dying, man. Start with. I've been doing a 45 on our load now. Oh, before I'm just doing everything in order. That's good. You should get one of these. What is fitbit? You'll become addicted to it. It attracted. We talked about

Speaker 7:          01:11:14       this on the podcast today with most people will know though, because we talked about it on the desk. Squad one. Oh yeah. So what it is, it's this thing that you clip on and it automatically tracks how many steps you make. How many stairs you walk? Uh, it tracks, you know, just like it's Bert Kreischer told us about it. Right. He was the one who, he's the one that told us about it on the Ice House chronicles and uh, so it's really neat is that it has like a thing in it that you could also wear when you sleep, so it detects whenever you wake up and so then it adds up how long you're actually sleeping every night. And you'll be surprised. You think like, oh I got like 10 hours sleep when in reality you didn't like half the time you were still awake or you would wake up and it's based on, you know, it detects like your heartbeat it detects, has a gyro stick open it or whatever the fuck it's called, where.

Speaker 7:          01:12:00       So it tells you, it knows when you're walking and all the amazing. Yeah. And then wirelessly broadcasts to this website and it shows you in graphs like, like how much you did and stuff. And you try to, the more you use it, the more you are like a game, you try to beat it. It's like twitter addictive, like it's really interesting and I like I just became friends on Bruckner Chrysler's a a thing that it's like having a new facebook where it just tracks your, your shit every night and I just did like a big credible. Yeah, I did a little review it on that desk. Squad dot TV and nurse links to buy.

Speaker 8:          01:12:31       I'll tell you something, bro. That new sleep apnea machine, they gave me the other one fucked up that time to give me a new one where I thought the old one was good. This new one. I can take the card out, put it into my computer and I could tell you what nights I drank alcohol. I don't drink alcohol. I can tell you that what nights I drank on because you can see it in your sleep pattern. That's amazing. I go from one to get one of these sessions and then the other thing it tells you I can even tell when I smoked a lot of weed that day. What was the difference? Really? If I smoked too much weed and my wife will tell you, you know you were snoring. I went by ambulance at one and smoke 50 fucking join.

Speaker 5:          01:13:07       That makes you snore more. Something probably because you relaxed. Good. Yeah. That's what it is. You're probably out there. Fucking cold. Brian Red Band desk squad number six on the podcasts. On itunes. Right now. Number six bitches. That's pretty strong around guys. Oh Shit. What'd you just congratulate? Reward as the Lincoln Dude. That's strong. That's from the icehouse chronicles. Alan. Also Brian Cowen show. Now is it just going to call it the Brian counts gunshot, which I like. Which I liked too. He doesn't even know the name. He was trying to figure out if he should have a theme, but I'm like, he's so interesting. Why box yourself in that guy can just ramble on about anything. You know, he's, he's one of my favorite dudes to talk to and that podcast we had with Dane Cook. That was amazing. That was interesting. And that dude, Tj Miller apparently wants to talk to me about it.

Speaker 5:          01:13:57       I would talk to them about it. You know, I, I don't hate that dude. I don't know. I don't, you know, I, I don't, I don't think it's a good idea to go on long rants about people working out material that haven't been on stage for a year though. I just, that's just, that's just how feel, you know. Joey, what are you doing? Just checking on something which is called listen, I, I don't know what it was about. I didn't, I don't give a fuck if you don't know. It's about everybody should bump Jane Cook, bumped them, dump, bumped everybody at the laugh factory which happens on stage and while it does happen all the time, you know, but what I said to Dan really does stand true. Like really he doesn't have to do that and it's a strong move to just come on after everybody. It's a strong move to like let everybody else go on stage and then you go on last man, you're the big star.

Speaker 5:          01:14:46       I agree. And like tell everybody like let them know, hey Dane Cook is going to be on later. Yay. So then these guys do their time. They will get. Wait, it ain't that hard man. It ain't that hard to wait. But it's a thing that we had to experience where we're coming up. Uh, it was a constant thing. It always has been that way, especially in La when a big guy shows up, whether it's Jerry Seinfeld or whoever the fuck it is, they show up, they get on stage and part of that thrill is that the audience members know that if they come to the Improv, it's very likely one night that may be Daniel Tosh or walk on walk on stage. Even if he's not on the schedule that may be someone that you've seen on TV. We'll walk on stage and that's a part of the thrill.

Speaker 5:          01:15:25       And in, in the, the standup comic does the famous ones in exchange, they do these sets for free. The, for the, for their ability to just go onstage anytime they want. And it does seem unfair to the people that are coming up. I completely agree. You know, it's, it's unfair, no doubt about it. I don't do it. But, um, I understand, I under, I understand that the idea behind it because every comic has had to deal with that. I the only time I've ever bumped anybody's when I show up the club and then they asked me, would you like to go on stage? I'm like, if it's not a big deal, I'll go on stage, but I don't want to fuck anybody's night up and then they'd go and check and make sure everything's okay, but if there's any drama or bullshit at all, I would way rather just go on last.

Speaker 5:          01:16:05       Just put me on after everything's done. Like what? You can't. You can't perform at the end. Everybody is so terrified of someone strong going on before them, which is so silly because that's what you want. You want. Everybody laughed. The reason why I started bringing you on the road with me, the reason why I bring an Rv on the road with me or done because they're fucking hilarious. I went to the Improv twice in the last 10 days and both times people came up to it. They had to leave and go do it. Yeah. They don't want to go on after you know I don't give a fuck because I'm going to get off stage and you're still going to be in the bar drinking. Take that bottom, break it over your fucking head so before you come lie to me that you have a showcase at the store or you gotta go.

Speaker 5:          01:16:44       Just be mad. There was a show that just show then, but don't come up to me and say you got to go up because your agency and your agents at all meat and cheese doodles don't. Don't tell that she was a lot of that at the store. Guy would claim that he had a showcase. There was guys who used to get sets. They couldn't get sets, but they could get sets when they had showcases so they would lie and say they were having a showcase and nobody was showing no. I got a call and say I'm accommodating. And was my youngest moved?

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       Yeah, that was my young love. That movie letting Mitzi ice to melt. That's what he did. He started having regular showcase. They give you a nine slash 15 spots to come in and say hello, get a drink. Some bitches, you know, that's, that's where you see the fake it till you make it mentality, you know, when you're in the, the, the, the dirty stages of standup development, you know, when everybody's scrounging for morsels are all trying to get onstage as much. Especially like, I don't know how the fuck anybody starts in La. That's brutal. Brutal. I mean, I already did it already. Basically did his whole career here. But uh, you know, he, he got, he got, yeah, he and he got in early at the store too. He got stage time. He got plenty of stage time. That's huge man because he got in like just a couple of years and it was career when we started hanging out with us, you know, like we started taking them on the road.

Speaker 3:          01:18:00       He was, you know, just a few years into his career. You know, it's amazing how, how last year I put it together. I didn't know to about 18 to two years ago how much I missed the store. Not The fucking dickheads, but how much I missed that type of performing every night and that's why I made a note now that I always try to go to crazy places at least every 10 days, twice a once a week. I got to go someplace where it's unpredictable. I don't want to be in a comedy store setting because I want that comedy store. The what made me a comic was going up at 1145 after you have to fucking tyree after Mooney by the matter of fact, I do ms Dot Paula. Morning. I missed that. You want me to tell you? Uh, I missed the expression that everybody gets, that Nigga wake up call.

Speaker 3:          01:18:44       I really do because it helps me. It hit home with me so much more. When we went to Miami, they kept saying Cuba come in. Those Cubans, this, we got that Nigga wake up call with the little kid that they came with the idea that when they had that pulled them out of the closet, whatever. Fidel came right in that governor said, go take them. She met me. She said, go down there and take them. They weren't right until the name. What the fuck was that all about? What was that all about? Aliens. Gonzalez Gonzalez. What was, what was that? And now he's a patriarch in Cuba. He's crazy. Dick up like fucking really? That joker. Who's the retarded kid that had this TV show? Corky corky. He's like that with a bib on and Cuba in 1950 cadillac with raft kid. He's good looking now. They just had a thing.

Speaker 3:          01:19:31       His mother died and he was fucking floating out there on a twig and some fishermen pick them up. Imagine what is going to happen when Fidel died because there was a fake. Fidel died a thing on twitter the other day. People are wondering, what about the time I told Eddie Fidel died and he was with Dana White and he thought it was a bad conversations with the died. Did you ever hear about that? So I'm going to Cuban place and he calls me [inaudible]. What's up? I got nothing. I'm overheating cubic foot. And you know Eddie likes all that revolutionary down. I go to Gio. There's a rumor going around brother

Speaker 5:          01:20:07       Fidel Catholic. I said, Fidel died. She's like, well, let me go online. So he goes online. He was. Hold on Dana White's right here. Let me ask him.

Speaker 9:          01:20:18       Date is online looking for chocolate. Don't die. Wouldn't you want to verify that? Hold on. Did you just say

Speaker 5:          01:20:32       Ladelle? Chuck Liddell when you want to verify that. I call bell and see filled. I said look down. Was he on the rampage? Was He a. was he a Tomahawk in? No, no, no. He was a Tomahawk and no, no, he was straight. It was like 8:00 once I'd Indian comes out. Right. I remember when you first started saying that about him. Oh my God. Because people don't know what that is. It's something that's in your jeans when you're digging up that when you drink, you go to the other fucking direction. When I drink, I wish, but I don't say shit. I got to go home. Some people drank a fucking fight. I mean bro, you, you grew up in Boston. You really seen motherfuckers that would have two beers and take their shirt off in 10 degree weather and want to fight a black bar.

Speaker 5:          01:21:15       Like we're going down that block and you're like, you're not fucking, are you fucking kidding me guy? You cannot do that. But there's people that drink and don't say nothing. There's people that drink and giggle. That's just some people that some people are not supposed to be. I hope they recognize it. The most important thing is that they recognize it because they think it's fun until they see it, you know, it's fun to them. Like they just disappeared. Like how fun would it be if you stopped being Joe Rogan and went into his face for eight hours and then woke up with fucking scars on your fucking pubic hair on your face and a handcuff on. It is amazing to me though when people have such different reactions to certain drugs, you know, and that alcohol is really one of them. That's. So it's like until I met Eddie, I didn't believe in blackouts.

Speaker 5:          01:21:59       I didn't believe it didn't believe. People tell me they blacked out, like how convenient chips always tell you that they suck your dick in your ass all the next morning I blacked out. What happened? You know what happened? My fucking ass. Like a savage. Hold on. What happened? I don't remember any. Oh my God, we did that. Came on your fucking neck. Remember? What? Did you speak in a rape man? I saw that movie. The girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Holy Shit. That's a bad ass bitch. Ooh, that girl who plays it. I've never seen her before. I don't know who she is, but that girl can fucking act. That's a crazy movie, man. Whew. There's some scenes in that movie. It felt like a movie where they were trying to. It was in fact a book that they were trying to condense down into movie form.

Speaker 5:          01:22:41       It was really hard because it's obviously very, very good located in involved, but as you know, it doesn't fail as a movie. It's fucking good. There's some, some bad ass scenes, but that check is wild. Gina Carano movie. No review. I heard the reviews are spectacular. They said that rotten tomatoes gave it a 100 percent, which is like nobody ever sees that. I mean that it's temporary because the cuts will come out and find out about it. He didn't clear right online and some asshole comes on as their shit all over it just because he knows it and went to the movies and said that the trailer Gina Day, they asked me that. It looks wild. They go, it's fucking great. It looks great as it come out this weekend that I know it did good. I want one guy wide. The one I seen, I heard it's bad ass.

Speaker 5:          01:23:28       Bad Ass. I heard like the God, that guy's like a real artist who created it, you know, he, he really knows what the fuck he's doing and he really created this around her. You know of the world needs more ass kicking checks. Fun. We'll get the one chick that trying to make it. She's a bad motherfucker. The Australian check with Kate Beckinsale oh, bad ass bitch. That bitch is bad. I've seen up close and personal. Toronto is so legit though. Come around the world and you know what she's like, really like now that Cyborg tested positive. It shows it shines a light on all the cyborgs, past victories, and you gotta you gotTa. Look at it and go, man, it's unfortunately cast doubt tasks down in her old career, especially since they released a video that showed her first fight ever in her first fight ever.

Speaker 5:          01:24:14       She was not built like that at all. Not even remotely. You know, she changed and she changed pretty radically and it doesn't seem to be endogenous chemicals. If you have an initial video of her from a long time ago, they chose a different body, different body types, and that's not, you know, you're not a man. Well, how are you? How are you doing that man? So you've got to look at that man and say, this Gina Carano man, if she didn't know that would have been imagined. Gina Carano versus route Ronda Rousey two of the hottest chicks to ever fight. Ever going at it. Do you know nuts that fucking fight? Would it be to stone cold? It's gonna Hands. That's the next one to tens that are killers and they're throwing down Gina Carano versus Ronda Rousey would get like, that's like a fight that actually could make it into the UFC.

Speaker 5:          01:24:56       Like that's a fight. We're Dana white would be like, you know what, alright, this fight. I would have this fight in the UFC is like a special attraction. I mean I'm just guessing it would do that. He would probably have like a big event for strikeforce, but I mean, could you imagine the kind of press you can get when you get to chicks who are super hot, who actually can fucking fight both of them? She'll get the winter of those two because it made sense to me today at the movie did really well. If she would have fought in June or July and she wouldn't have done well then the movie, they said, fuck it. Stay away from everything. Just let the movie come out, pop it. All of a sudden the fucking Brazilian comes up positive and she's back in the fucking game. The movie big.

Speaker 5:          01:25:37       Great. She's back in the fucking game now, so she's going to probably get the winter of tea, take on a fight, man. See what, why would she, why would she want to fight if this movie? Then she just goes off and you know, man, brain damages for keeps. If you don't want to fight, you shouldn't be fighting. You know, fighting is something you should only do when you absolutely want to do. Just that. If she, if she really has this call on the back of her head, she wants to get back in there and test herself. You know, she's, she's a bad ass chick. She wants to do that. But I love it. A debt. No, no reason to do it. If she doesn't, she's got an amazing opportunity. She has an opportunity that very few humans ever get to be a real legit female movie action star.

Speaker 5:          01:26:17       I mean, she's, she's going to say the right things. She's smart. She's not a mean person. She's a humble person. She's like, she's like a happy, friendly person that people like root for, you know, even checks like her, you know? And then also they like about her. She's not like real skinny. She's not all skinny and bones. She's, she's got meat on her. She's, oh it's high fat. That man. Yeah, I liked that. I don't like, I don't like skinny on a girl. It doesn't. I like a girl is not afraid to eat, you know, to me, don't go and get sloppy. Let's not get crazy. But you can get a little fat, little fat. It's actually kind of sexy. Something dirty about it. Keeps the monkey fresh. Does it? And lubes the joints, the joints. It was some fucking ice and I acetone and Khloe line and shit.

Speaker 5:          01:27:04       Everything's good. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. The world needs more bad ass superhero chicks. This dragon tattoo check. And this is Gina Carano check. I seen that other fucking crazy ass movie. Black Swan with mine. Occula. Whatever her name is. That bitch. Get the fuck out of the professionals. Little girlfriend cause she's the one in it as the black swamp. I don't tell me I'm going to watch the beginning. It scared me out. But the ending of this movie is very fucking. I seen the last hour last night and it really helped me. It was shit on television. I wanted to watch them like, wait a second. The one girl is all grown up. I can't believe that was her and the professional. That movie's a fucking great movie. It's a great machine. It was on the I nine. I watched Gary Oldham is fucking great. He would pop the pills and throw his neck back and heroin and shooting motherfuckers and carry.

Speaker 5:          01:27:53       Homo was great in that movie. He was great. Danny Aiello is even in that movie. Oh yeah. He's the, he's the hit, but he's the guy that gives uh, the Italian guy. The assignments and shit. Yes. Fucking Danny Aiello. I think he even stopped doing comedy now. Denny a lot. He had a comedy club in hoboken on Tuesday night place and he would put my name up on a bunch of comments. The songs? Yeah. Are you serious? I swear to God. What was that show that he had on CBS for awhile? A Terra Nova something. Look it up. The last disaster of CBS, a melon Ghana or something like that, that he was a PA public investigator

Speaker 7:          01:28:32       Chrysler on 10 TV,

Speaker 5:          01:28:34       whether it's people's name. How do you suppose named Danielle? I know a I e l l o

Speaker 7:          01:28:40       pressure on CBS News in Columbus, Ohio and he got to do the weather and it was so fucking hilarious. If you what? What did he do? He was just like acting out like if it was cold, but for her, you know, and like just making a. He was just burnt Chrysler on the whether it was. What if you could imagine.

Speaker 5:          01:28:55       That's awesome. Is that TV show than Gosha Della Delavan?

Speaker 3:          01:29:04       Look at the IMB be. I'm looking at it. Nineteen 98. That was the last temptation of Christ. What year was this? [inaudible] 98, which will delve into Aventura when we first started hanging out in Miami. When they put his picture up at the Improv,

Speaker 5:          01:29:18       I clipped it onto my shirt and yeah, I kept it out. He was my favorite, a goof for awhile. I have all those on the. I still have those old vhs sussman. When they were, they had the king of Queens over at CBS. I got them to get me the tapes from the Delavan tour show because it was so delicious now and have people come over and watch it with me. We wouldn't get high and watch it like it was a comedy, so fuck. It was a great show. He would always win no matter what happened. This is what I remember. He had a meeting with this guy about some information that could lead to the conclusion of my case. Susan there playing pool and he can't mess just fucking rocketing balls in and the guy goes, worst acting of all time. The WHO's playing goes, hey man, you're the best I ever seen. What's your secret? He goes, my secret, don't miss. And it was like fights. He would get in fights and he's a rusty old man. I mean he's old, he's old, he's old. I mean, we're not talking about US investors to loan old worries, you know, shooting fucking synthetic hormones into his body every day and he's 64 years old.

Speaker 3:          01:30:23       That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking like he looks like an old man, but meanwhile he's knocking dudes out with one punch. Pop like, guys, give them trouble. Hey, get outta here. He just everywhere he goes, like no one's hitting him. He's never got a struggle. Yeah, he's dominated everything. He's just the coolest cop of all time and it's so ridiculous that it becomes funny. It's becomes really subtle. So Nice. We're going to sit alone and crazy Italians, I guess frank stallone's been coming back to the boxing gym. Justin's and they can't take them no more. So the quickest way to get rid of Frankston loans to put wrap on. Oh really hates rap music. So they put rap on like, you know, Nwa and they have bets on how long the loan or last and really. So he's in their shadow box and he'll look at the speakers, he'll fuck it.

Speaker 3:          01:31:09       Then he'll come up to them and say, listen, why don't we listen to some good music put on one of my albums? And they all look at him like, are you fucking serious? He'll give you his album. You know that frank stallone and gives album albums. He plays right here at fucking Malibu. The Malibu when? Once a month he's got the. You got to go as a goof on time. All the Italian show update. Kiss him. What do you think his relationship is like with his brother? What do you think it would be? It must be crazy. Get the fuck Outta here. Locked the door behind you. Dumb fuck. I'm going to invest in a cheeseburger chain and you're going to be the head singer. That guy's got to come in every day with a different pitch. Slide. Don't mean to bother you, but listen, we've got an idea for a new movie.

Speaker 3:          01:31:47       I think they even made a movie together. The one with dice that die sued everybody. Remember? They all just alone. Remember that for no. A movie about golf? Yeah. Lilly, about when we were at the store were telling us a story that night and didn't never got. Never got released because it is fucking horrible. It is frank stallone, directing and shit. It's the loans. Got All his friends and it's still bad pictures of birds and fucking people drinking water loans, hitting a golf ball and shit. Oh my God. That's hilarious. Frank fucking stallone. Oh my God. That is hilarious. That'd

Speaker 5:          01:32:25       be a weird thing to have a brother that's like super duper famous and you're just hanging on trying to make some shit happen. That's gotTa to be frustrating as fuck. Probably makes you want to be famous. Also like look at Charlie Murphy, you know, and he's probably, that's why he. Well it is totally with Charlie, but Charlie is actually, you know, he's made it. He's making money, he's doing well, he's in movies, doing great with standup and then there's like, you know, the Baldwin brothers where everybody makes it, you know, everyone sort of sort of, kind of that they made it for a little while. All of them were in the light for awhile while, but now it's only Alec. He's the only one who, he's the most talented though, right? Yeah. Oh definitely. Yeah. That's what it is. Like talent just rises to the top. Like there was another one I liked, but I only bought one billy William. Now William, I think will's a difference. Bill. He's the handsome one. Williams the one with the big face I think I'll see. I don't remember. But he's handsome too. He's just handsome. Like, like he drank a lot of sodium filled products. Sodium.

Speaker 5:          01:33:24       Yeah, they are A. I mean there's a bunch of families where there's a bunch of different brothers or get in and everybody does so. So, but one guy is like the best. But the ball. Michael Jackson. Yeah. Well that's the most ridiculous whenever. Right? Right. You know, you imagine growing up with someone who's uh, your brother and you, you're both doing the same thing and you just can't fucking hit. And this guy's just gotTa. That's gotta be nuts, man. Sibling rivalry is a motherfucker. Look at Mcdonald's brothers. She threw that motherfucker out. What happened? Like she threw him the fight and that guy was just creepy. He was opening up shit with her name. I mean it just gets old Mcdonald's brothers and stiff. He's got a brother that wrote the book, the tell all book. Now he just had something on the AOL Google the other day that he's homeless and Michigan is just the won't help them because you get fucking creepy on these people.

Speaker 5:          01:34:12       Don't, can't get previously a family. You can't. Right. Tell all books and the same thing that makes them. Madonna could also make a loser. You don't. You don't get a Madonna with conventional child rearing and paying off the right amount of attention to your kids. Know you get a Madonna. If you fucked up, you get a madonna. If you ignored that kid, you get a madonna. If somebody did something to it, an early age that made her determined or you get a guy, a guy, one of the same thing. You don't get those. Those chicks are in the. It's not easy to develop one of those. You've got to give him some pain. You got to do so things. Did you rather fuck Madonna or Gaga? Right now I'm going Gaga for sure. Yeah, she's hot. Her body is hot as fuck. Dude. That fucking pretty bad ass.

Speaker 5:          01:34:56       Not really. No. Diamond got old macdonald last week. She got old. She's trying to force those biceps and tell people she's a Jew and I did have a dream that I ran into Madonna and all of a sudden she was young again. It's amazing. You just brought this up because I had this dream last night and I'm just remembering it now. It was one of those really fucking Nutty Alpha brain dreams, which no one will deny if you. You could say you don't think that Alpha brain works. It doesn't seem to affect you and enhance your cognitive function. That's all. Well and good. You know, I don't know how your brain works, but you can't tell me that it's not super reliable for making crazy dreams because I don't know if I can take a pill that I knew for sure if I took the shit before bedtime.

Speaker 5:          01:35:37       Apparently it's not working for everybody though. A lot of people say they're not getting the lucid dreams. You know, a lot of times at the beginning of it. You headed at the beginning, but then I stopped having them real. Yeah. Well, I get them intermittently and I never know when they're coming, but I got one last night and it was super vivid and last night it was me hanging out with Madonna and I was being like real creepy with her. I was like, it was weird because she was like, actually it was like some sort of a weird thing like I was, I was much younger than I am now. Um, I remember because I remember I had no family and no responsibility in my dream is that I just asked me how I know about them in a bar, like a shitty bar. Nope. It was some weird fucking a booth of a club and I'm like really close to her skin and I'm admiring her skin and I'm telling her, wow, you look amazing.

Speaker 5:          01:36:22       Like I'm really like blown away. It was like, because I guess I had, I couldn't figure out in the stream whether I'd traveled through time or, you know, whether uh, I lived in a different place when it was. I actually 17 years old and when she actually 24 it was I was in 1984, 1985 again, or was this supposed to be? She rejuvenated and she's now 20 years old again and now she looks hot as fuck because she looked even younger than she looked. When she became famous there was a really weird dream because I couldn't figure out what was happening in it. I couldn't figure out if, you know, I was like, why? Why do I feel like I'm a young man? I could just, but I also have all this information in my head. It's very strange, but I met Don to. I used to have a thing for Madonna man when I was young.

Speaker 5:          01:37:10       I thought she was hot as fuck because she was dirty. She was dirty, dirty Italian. When you're young, a young little 17 year old savage with your hormones on full blast like I was. I was like so excited that a girl is dirty. She's dirty. That pitch. Yeah. What? She's like the original snookie. How dare you fucking. I used to go to this club called making yourself laugh when I was in high school. I was a senior in high school. I used to go to this club called, I can't remember it now, and when I was in there every Saturday, you know was a girl would come in. I don't even know who the fuck the girl was and they let us say, but I've never really paid attention because he was lip singing, just play a song and that's terrible data really. She was saying back then back then, well

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       it was a club. It was at this goal, a rooftop or something and a Dj and Austin. They go, we have a special for somebody to come in. She's going to sing a song, and it was madonna singing. I'm like, Lucky Star. We didn't. Yeah, we didn't know at that time it when they first started having videos on MTV and you for folks today that live in this day and era, this is not going to be impressive, but back then when Madonna first started having these music videos like burning up, that's a. that's all she took. She took with Donna Summers, was doing it and was like, you know what, you just not being clear enough what you want. Let me tell you what I'm looking for. I'm looking to where it crosses and get fucked hard. I'm going, we're going to wear lace and get choked that you want to be, but you can't let go. Come on, let's go. I'm burning.

Speaker 3:          01:38:49       I'm burning in sex. Tremendous, tremendous. Then she had that dancer body with a little plumpness to her too. You know, like she was eating well for the first time in her life. God Damn desperately seeking. Susan came on the street. She does a million fucking people. Yeah. People don't even know what a gay.

When I went to jail I got my life and I became a minister, so I come and married one of his checks that he kidnapped me straight up.

Speaker 8:          01:44:41       Kidnaps this chicken. I married him on the show. Do you have any scenes with any hot checks? AIPAC, the blonde, but I didn't know. Like I watched the first time they got black people on General Hospital. I didn't know that. So talking to you? Yeah, it was very shocking to me. I didn't even see if they passed that law in 99 and then the brothers fucking soap operas. Where is the brothers? And then she'll have like a black soul. Well, son did used to do soap operas, which was in, what was he in? Was he in general hospital or something like that, but whatever it was, he was on top. Yeah, we're sons. Talented man. That who? Raja. For people who don't know, that's a. that's a hilarious comedian. All that. There's like all these videos of me arguing with a crazy Brazilian jujitsu guy online.

Speaker 8:          01:45:27       That's my friend Russ on and he's A. He's an Eddie Bravo Brown belts. He's just an actor. He's just, he's this character that he does and every now and then he'll want to confront me about some things and get into this big long arguments like Eddie's Eddie thinks it's hilarious. He loves doing it. So Eddie sets it up all the time, but his actual name is for song and he's hilarious. How funny is it? That resigned? Father was my first karate teacher when I came from. It's amazing. So how's that circle fucking flow with amazing resigns and it was such a great guy bro. And we have to get reassigned. To tell you the story about his father's karate school, his father's karate schools on 100 street and Amsterdam. It was, it was black. It was painted black. The walls were black biggies with black. Black was beautiful.

Speaker 8:          01:46:11       It was like 70. You've got a fist go Jew, you gotTa fucking fist and said go Jew. And you've got this thing on the back and a Japanese letters. Let me tell you what he used to make us do. Her son's father, he'd make us run to central park barefoot with the fucking karate uniforms on. Know how scared I used to be at barefoot on the street run, run, run. He makes us fucking run whenever. Fees on what if you saw broken down? She'll play. Didn't give a flop. That's what toughen you up. Mine number one. Time is resigned. Father kicked me in the stomach when I was about six. You know when the ad comes out of you for the first time I took one, like I'm wanting to go back to karate, but he was a good guy bro. He taught me a lot of good shit. My first karate, Joe Esposito,

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       who's now the head of the, he's one of the big guys at the Massachusetts State Athletic Commission, so they regulate mixed martial arts. I took her class from him and he signed, kicked me in the stomach. They would do bad. They would say tighten up. I mean, he didn't hit me hard. I was only like 14. He just gave me a little little tap, but that was common, you know, the instructor would walk by, tighten up and they'd fucking blast in the stomach while you're in line, you know, you had to always be prepared, always be solid. You know, where the Koreans came over to teach tae kwon normally walk around with a stick. Oh yeah. In the back of the legs if you get. Koreans were like super strict fluid restriction. But because of that there their team was fucking monstrous. Man. The Korean national team for a while until the, the real uh, the Americans got real good at it.

Speaker 5:          01:47:36       And then there was some other entries from other parts of the world that were like really high level. But for awhile the Koreans just dominated taekwondo tournament and a lot of it was the high level training and the discipline that they had there, they took it serious. Now you can't hit your kids no more. You can't try out a friend. My friend was, uh, going to med school, my friend junk sick and he, he won the national championships. He had it. He took time off to, to win the nationals. He took time off to train, took time off, away from the school, which was a big fucking deal because he was going through like some serious, serious fucking schoolwork. And I remember watching this kid, I couldn't believe how fucking hard he worked, you know, it was just, it was incredible to watch. It was, it was really like inspiring because this guy was always tired.

Speaker 5:          01:48:20       He was exhausted and yet he would still find time to train and we were talking about it, you know, back then he was a little bit ahead of me. He was like, um, when I was hitting a national level of my skills, he was already there. So he was like a little bit ahead of me and uh, I remember talking to him, I'm like, how are you doing this? Like, this is incredible that you find time to do all this school work and yet you still find time to train. And he's like, I barely can do it. I barely could do it. He goes, I'm so tired. I'm so tired. He would like when he was training for the nationals, he would do his homework and then he would put his backpack on with all of his books and he would run up and down the stairs in his, uh, in his dormitory where he stayed and it was just, that's how he would get like a lot of his cardio training in it would just put his books in his bag and run up and down the stairs.

Speaker 5:          01:49:07       And he would tell me about like how exhausted he was when he, when he would come to work out and train. But that fucking guy just kept chipping away. And it's like, I learned a lot watching that dude. Like, we'll learn that there's like levels of commitment and discipline and for whatever reason, a lot of Asian people instill that in their children that like real intense discipline, you know, proud of their kid when their kid becomes a doctor, proud of their kid when the kid said something really, really difficult, that's a, that's a mother fucker, man, that's a, that's a to, to, to have like that, that high expectations of yourself, you know, you're really setting up for a very stressful, stressful life. And I know he eventually stopped competing because it was too much, you know, to do that. And he assumed his, his practice, you know, to, to become a doctor and you know, and, and studies to become a doctor.

Speaker 5:          01:50:00       And he got right back into that now, but became 100 percent of his focus. But he did what he wanted to do, you know, he got there, he got where he wanted to get and then, you know, he realized his dream and that was just back to work. And I was like, man, that's a, that's a tough life. That's a lot of work. You don't look at the discipline, even with the Japanese, with the Yakuza, they fuck up. They gotta cut a finger off. Yeah. That's that discipline in the United States. Comfortable at work late. You're going to cut a fucking finger up and you have to cut it off yourself. That's the motherfucker didn't see. If somebody grabs you and cut your finger up you. Well you have to go in there with a knife, put your hand in thing and tie advantage over your hand and drive yourself to the fucking hospital.

Speaker 5:          01:50:38       I said, oh, that's a level of commitment and that's the fucking up for slipping. They let you live, but you fucking finger you. She was the whole thing or a joint. Is it like a big thing? The whole thing off the joint. Everything really. They start like they take joints off though. They chop like I dunno, I, I think that's what it is. It's digital. It's like, what does it matter? I fuck up and I cut my fucking manicure. I told my fucking jam or something, but for me to cut a finger off. I mean that's just, that's. And you do it with honor? Yeah. You do it with like you come in and go, I'm sorry I fucked up out of my respect for you. I'm going to chop my fucking finger up to my family. That's that. I was talking to a friend of mine who had something going on where he was involved with a bunch of a businessman and they.

Speaker 5:          01:51:27       One of them was this Japanese guy that kept showing off the fact that his finger was missing like cat. He would flaunt it. The fact is in laugh about it, it's fingers, Mr. see that you see that like apparently like I guess in Japan and must carry a lot of weight. Someone sees someone sees you with a finger that you probably chopped off yourself like Ooh, this guy's willing to take shit to a different level and they've been touting themselves up for 200 fucking years. Like the bodysuit body body tax and the way they do this super painful super fucking pain. All that shit is just. It's a different approach than the traditional method of tapping that tat tat tat tat the way they do it very different than like a needle, like a, like a, a tattoo and modern tattoo needed where they essentially just draw it. It wasn't like that back then.

Speaker 1:          01:52:15       That's how Steve got his tattoo and he will just tie tattoos. You went to the same person. That engine Lena Jelly did it and got the exact same tattoo. She well for awhile. Every tattoo that she got, he would get to. He would recreate her tattoos. So fun. It's taking it to the next level and really loves her because these crazy I love. I love the fact that people like Steve Will there that I love. The fact is people that are willing to climb up a tree and little lion come get you. He was great. We got to get him on this podcast for sure. Gets he gets he loathes Angelina Jolie or. Yeah. Well I don't know. My thing is we love the loves, the idea of the goof of it. You know that he's going to get every tattoo that she gets. So he went to billy Bob on his arm.

Speaker 1:          01:52:53       Does he have Billy Bama? His arm? No, but that would be funny. I don't know if he. Maybe he took it off when she took hers off because she took hers off. He actually took off his shirt on when we had him on one, that old podcast at my apartment. He took off his shirt and showed us all his tattoos. Oh yeah. He's got a shitload of no one's on his back or a pretty amazing. And they has a picture of himself on his back. He does like, it looks like an airbrush. Like perfect. That's your choice though. That's really a questionable choice. I could see getting Angelina's the tattoos on your body, but doing a tattoo of your own face. So what? The people that got a tattoo? A George Lopez. Oh yeah, that's a fucking statue. Yeah. Live with forever. Will you do. Now that he got fucking file off 10 do.

Speaker 1:          01:53:34       Well he's still going to tour and probably kill him. He's never going to be at a long for, for income if he decides to tour, you know. Don't you think that guy was selling out the Hollywood bowl? Who's selling all giant places? I just took a flight last week with Paul. Regina on the flight. Oh yeah. You've got to get up on that microphone. Sit right next to me talking about the store and it's pretty interesting to talk to. Paul Rodriguez was there in the early days, right? Wasn't he there and that Chico in the man days when when fucking homeboy killed themselves. What was that guy's name to kill themselves? Freddie prinze, Freddie Prinze, and the guy who took his place was Danny Maura, who's also a comedy store. Regular. Took his place. She chicos plays for a season. Then you weren't going to replace fucking Freddy parties. Friends at that time. Who is to commit?

Speaker 1:          01:54:22       That jumped off the building of the comedy store right next door. I don't know who they're going to remember that. Right? Well, I heard the story, but I don't know who. The guy was mad that some guy jumped off the building right next to the comedy store at that though. Hide Hotel or whatever it's called. That was during the, the the riots or the whatever the fuck it was. Now there's an advertisement for mad men on there where it's just a shadow of somebody falling down that building and it's so creepy to look at because that's the shadow. That's exactly where that guy killed himself. I wonder if they knew that now. I don't think I do. You don't think that now? I don't mean, isn't it? Yeah, and a lot of people at the comedy store, like I said something to them and they're like, oh my God, you're right.

Speaker 1:          01:55:03       Holy Shit. I didn't even think of that. There was anyone that was thinking that was the boycott, right? They boycotted all the clubs. You know, back in the day, comedy clubs in La didn't pay anything. Now they pay a little bit, they pay a tiny bit, but back then they didn't pay a God damn thing and so guys were packing the place and killing them. Then all the clubs were making money and the truck clubs or treats you like shit. So the only, the only place where clubs get away with that, they have that sort of slave owner mentality like some of them do, some of them do still to this day. They think that you're doing some sort of an honor by performing there. So how many stores really tighten their ship lately? That they got a whole new staff and there are no one's the same anymore. That it's completely like a normal club now. I think. Which one? The comedy story. The last year

Speaker 7:          01:55:43       they've just pretty much overhauled the whole entire thing. So now it's like a food. Yeah, it's got food that people are getting paid or getting spots. The only thing that you don't see is you don't see a lot of new comics going through there a lot. It's still kind of like the same like you know, like a Saturday night live season. How could it possibly be improving with those people at the helm? Yeah. Well I mean the. I think Tommy is the only person that, that, that you would know their lives are problem and that bartender people back all the buckets still there. Oh yeah. All those guys are still there. That guy's cool as fuck. There was a, you know, you talk about it. We've talked about it. It was a. That was a cool time. You know, that was a fun place to hang out.

Speaker 7:          01:56:22       That's what everybody misses about it. And you know what? It's a. It was never was what the ice houses. The ice house is way better. It's a way better vibe. The fact that we got that podcast room right next to it, the fact that everybody's hanging around there and you don't know who's the GM though now or. I think he's the GM. Yeah, he's the GM is Adam now from Arizona. So it's like the dean, the new Dean is the guy that we're friends with. It used to be at the, uh, the Improv in. Oh, that's hilarious. And the manager will good for him, man.

Speaker 8:          01:56:51       Go serve this purpose with that. Yeah. It was like that bar you went to for a year when you lived in that place where you ate, that it served its purpose. You know, it was there for me and moved on. And I don't even think about it no more when I drive by that it's weird foreign fucking place to me. I'll even try to drive down there. I have this download today and I drove by and it's like I don't even look no more. It's strange when I do drive by drive by felt bad if he didn't stop in like I keep on finding a new place or something and you're like, let me stop. And then. So we used to do the Improv on melrose for New Year's

Speaker 7:          01:57:22       right back to the store and hang out and keep on finding new rooms and knucks like I just found a new nut the other day and I guess it's polly's office where he got that third set of stairs and I'm like, what the fuck is this place all about? And that's like, oh this is where you fuck a girl if you want to. Or you could smoke weed and like. And I'm like, oh this is awesome. Hilarious. At that place has got so many tunnels and secrets and hiding spots. Does poly still keep an office there? I think he might, but he's never there probably. I never see what does he see him once in a while? I do know he's on the road a lot. I think he does and he's doing movies. He just released that movie recently and, and I don't know what he's doing.

Speaker 7:          01:57:58       I saw him the other day. He had a camera crew there where he's like doing some kind of thing, like filming something. I don't know. Wow. But he's barely ever there. There's people like that. We'd just go, where is that guy now? I watched John Barris again this weekend and both nights. And that's the best shit about the economy store when it's. He, he, I think I got there at like one and we didn't leave the comedy store. Don didn't finished until like 4:00 AM. He got offstage. That's awesome. You know, comedy clubs stays till 4:00 AM. Yeah. That club is. We had some crazy things happen in that place. Yeah. Especially that original roommate let original world was just. That's a heavenly body, you know, that's a, that's uh, that's.

Speaker 8:          01:58:42       There's more, there's more energy in that room. There's more history in that room, you know, veteran mostly. Really any club in the country keeps you in check that room. Yeah, always keeps you in check. You could be at a weekend place all weekend, killing Monday. You pull up the comedy store, you think good, bad to the bone and you get not a fucking laugh. There's always drama and crazy shit happening. Yeah. Well there is no one's ever like quiet in the audience. It's always fucking chaos.

Speaker 7:          01:59:07       There was a girl Friday night and she was definitely a hooker that she was just sitting there using that. Patty, a lot of hookers sit at the patio because they can like, oh, like there's a patio in the front that's outside where people walk back and forth, up and down sunset. So a lot of the hookers just hang out at the patio and they look like normal girls at first. But then he realized what they're doing. They're just using the patio. How do they, uh, well, this girl, this was the most funniest thing ever. Like we would walk up and everyone's staring at this girl at the bar and I'm like, what? What's going on here? And I'm like, Holy Shit, but the back of her, she had only a thong on like a string Bikini Thong or whatever, and then just see through a mini skirt. Like you could see completely her butthole.

Speaker 7:          01:59:43       You could see it was crazy, like it could not be legal. And I'm like, oh my God. And she, her body was man. It was all right. So I was like, Holy Shit, that's awesome. What's going on in there? And he goes, dude, just relaxed way to see her face. I'm like, Oh fuck. So I go there and it was like facial hair, acne. It looked like a Mexican dude and drag her face was just. So was it a guy or was. No, it was just a very unfortunate monster that decided to wear like from behind it looked awesome. I mean I wonder how much she works, but we asked if we could take a photo or something. One of the comics asked like, can I take a photo with your. But you know, because that's how crazy it was. And she was like 20 bucks the price for it.

Speaker 8:          02:00:27       It's like, you know, when you take a picture with Spiderman over at the Hollywood bowl poster or Hollywood boulevard, it's a donation, right? This story is that why would a hooker going into a store and try to get money when there's so many other hookers that go there? Something big for free. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:00:44       Well, not just using the via the sunset, so who does stock or sell their selves without being on the corner? You know what I mean? People walk by a storm like, oh, look at that girl.

Speaker 8:          02:00:54       You know there's a funny just walking that we're willing to suck Dick. You just had a fucking pulled back. The audit choke and fucking find out that you just need the clouds to part to see the true color of this guy's about crazy. Women went to the store. They go in there. I mean that'll happen that the fiber room that'll happen at the house of Blues. That whole area is just nuts. That very famous, very vegas. When a woman comes and she moves to La and she doesn't really know how the things that could happen. Yeah. The things that can happen to a woman, I'm a producer, I want to take you out to lunch. Next thing you know you're getting fucked by eight fucking I read whatever the fuck they do, rags or whatever. It's just so weird that chances are when you're a woman like you don't fucking know.

Speaker 8:          02:01:43       You know? Yeah. You could get lucky and wind up being Brooke Burke and being on dancing with the stars and making millions and smiling or yeah, you could suck one day, end up with a bad fucking guy that tells you who's next thing that you have a kid you here. It's just amazing and the same thing. You know, it's amazing fucking crap. Shoot man. For a woman, it's way harder, especially a woman trying to be a hot chick like I'm trying to be a professional hot check. Try and be an actress or something like that. Like so many of them in the volume. The numbers for every Gig that there is, the number of pretty girls that are driving in on buses and Lee especially now with the economy socking, how many of them were like, look, there's nothing here for me. I'm just going to give it a chance.

Speaker 8:          02:02:25       Just getting that bus and flying off to Hollywood. Woo. Amazing. Ah, well you and I have been here for so long now. We've kind of seen how weird it is to watch people arrive at facebook from girls that you're like, oh my God, what the fuck happened to you six years ago? You were sucking dicks behind the store and now you're a mom in Florida. Yeah. To get like, hey joey, I don't know if you're remember me and you look at the picture on facebook. You're like, oh my God, she's got like a crib and she always looks so much. They always look way more beat than live in the porn star pimp lifestyle. You are relaxed all the time. You know, you see him and they have 17 steps so far today, but that day I ran into so many crazy fucking women and men to men, men, women, everything.

Speaker 8:          02:03:16       That store was the, it was a, it was an attractor and it still is an attractor of crazy people comes up to you and says, can I talk to you for is negative, you know, you get funny and you know, I just wanted to be funny and they won't give me spots. What do I have to do to get spotted? And that's the magic answer. When they just say that to you, what are they doing? Guest spots and try to beat around the bush. Well, you could write jokes, you could go to a standup class or you can suck my dick. You know what I'm saying? Like you got three options and say, oh my God, it's. You had the one girl you talked about in the podcast and said, the less of message, I would send a letter about how your broker a broker.

Speaker 8:          02:03:55       And I didn't mean to break us. She was always willing to suck my dick. So what am I going remember with dirty fingernails when night me going, this is terrible like this and that little bathroom. The cubicle on the second floor. Remember the one by the phone where you answer that totally. How many fucking blow jobs that you get an ad from women that just said, if you suck my Dick when you put me on the belly room, show with you next week. Hey, call me and they'll just suck your dick for a fucking spot. Like in the belly room. Like a fucking Steven Soderbergh. He's going to fucking show up to the. And if they only knew about Mike Young's, just showcase. It's just a player. It's just fucking amazing. Out Women would fall. I started going on acting class and you book something and a girl sees you in acting class.

Speaker 8:          02:04:37       Oh my God. They're all over you outside. Like what do we need to do? What do I mean when you start sucking my dick or show me your pussy or something. You don't have any fucking victims. I had that with confused from acting class. Why? Actually when I was 415 pounds, like in 98, I had this 21 year old let me come over and fucking in the ass and I would fuck him and he asked him feel guilty. Like, when is she going to realize I'm a fat, disgusting slot? This chicken was like, right. Staying on that SUV, taking the garbage out. Let me suck your Dick. You hold. I'm a fucking Costar. You know what I'm saying? You got to hold out for the big fucking star. She was sucking Dick. What is wrong with you? $1,200 for the fucking day. Just sucking my Dick like I'm some stock.

Speaker 8:          02:05:19       I mean, she was serious. She was like, you have some girl that you were, you, you were getting in your acting class. That was also someone else. Someone was taking care of her. I don't know if he could say the guy's name. He had a black girl. Yeah. Yeah. We'll say it. I don't give a fuck. The Nero Nero had done. Everyone's got like these black chicks that he takes right from like south Florida. You're going to Florida. Those black chicks are raw, like go to Orlando and put those black chicks are mined from pumping out. They have no fucking Afro Sheen that had just goes up like Joe and Ahmed trading. They got fucking tattoos. That little heavy. This girl that Deniro had, he fixed her up. He gave a fake tits. He take away on her tattoos. He gave her the real hair. He bought that horse has she had this shit and he put her up in the fucking thing with Shaq lift and that's how we got the toddler.

Speaker 8:          02:06:14       What made you move? Like, you know, sometimes an acting class. They're like, well you want to meet at a coffee shop to do scenes or they either come to your house, are you go to that house? She said, you want to come to my house? I'll live in the Wilshire district. Okay. I didn't even know what the wish district is. I just started driving. She also had to pull off and there's a doorman and what the fuck is this bitch too? And after a while, one day she goes, my boyfriend's Deniro look at the sleep apnea machine, but she was telling me the whole story that she wouldn't see him and he would just call her on Friday and go get that black ass wash pop over for dinner. And it was all over the shop. How many of those do you think he has?

Speaker 8:          02:06:50       She said she knew she wasn't the only one. That's beautiful. And so they just do as a no questions asked policy, no questions asked when I come to town to trim down for a long time that buck wheat for years because was going to western that fucking cave that. I mean that's why he's got to keep doing these movies. And he's still in Russia. Those bad ones done some terrible ones. Bad ones now. But I think now he's too old and he enjoy his original original wife to either heavy set black jake. That's Kinda cute. You're like at least she's got some pizzazz, but you know, he had a couple of freaks that he had out there. And why not? I haven't seen a movie of his. It was good in a while. It's unfortunate when you think about it because he's the greatest actor of all time, in my opinion.

Speaker 8:          02:07:33       One of them, I shouldn't say the Gary Oldman's a bad motherfucker too. There's a lot of guys that are bad about Russell Crowe's bad motherfucker. This is a lot of bad motherfuckers, but you go back to like the raging bull days or the Cape fear days. Robert Deniro was a mother fucker. He was amazing man. And he was the first guy that really would like change his body. He gained a fuck load of weight for raging bull. Remember, he got in super good shape as a boxer and then he gained a lot of weight to play Ray Lamontagne, uh, in the, in the, in the later years. That was a fucking amazing performance drivers. Amazing performance. If you see him in taxi driver, that one scene where he goes to get Christopher walken and it's his turn and the guy smacks, smacks the guy back because you know you're going to die.

Speaker 8:          02:08:18       I'm gonna die anyway because we see good fellas. How good was he in goodfellows? How good was he in Godfather to the beginning? Yeah. Yeah. That shit. And he became like, that could be a young brand. Brandon. He really fucking had it down. He was, bro. That's one of my favorite movies of all. Godfather two is one of the most beautiful fucking. The Guy who stole that movie for me is that fucking Guinea. Fuck. A five, five angels. The guy that no mind jot in Las Vegas. I don't mind jot in Miami with Hyman Roth. That guy that was fucking crazy, that would always say shit, that Pachino he was the one that uh, duval made them commit suicide member. He went to see him in jail and at the end of the Romans they have a party and then they slip that fucking risks and that, that movie is a beautiful movement.

Speaker 8:          02:09:11       They go to Cuba and he tells them, Hey, I've seen something really interesting today. I seen the rebel blow up. And he goes, well, there's that tell you. He was a soldier. Gets paid to fight. Rebel does it for free. I don't like it. I didn't. I'm not gonna. Watch the movie again. Joe Rogan, I haven't seen that movie fucking movie again. I didn't see that on Dvr and I watched it about a month ago and I was blown away. Never seen it. It started on, this is how brilliant it starts out where the mother goes to the don and Sicily and says, you killed my husband and you killed my son. Spared him. He's fucking retarded. You don't. You don't like it because so many people like it. Is that one of those people are wearing God or good. What is it called again? Godfather father. Posters in their house and they only talk about it.

Speaker 8:          02:09:56       It's like, dude, that movie came out like 20 years ago and you're still talking about what's a great fucking movie? I know I get it, but it just wears on you. She goes, he goes, no, and he shoots the mother in front of. I don't remember this, but you're giving spoilers like a motherfucker, bro. He shoots the mother. Then he goes to Ellis island. He's alone. This world, he's fucking retarded. He had, he had yellow fever when he came from. I don't remember this, this neighborhood, but the whole is when he goes back to Sicily, he becomes Vito Corleone. He's got dog olive oil company. He goes back to Cici to get the guy who steals, who kills his mother, his father and his brother, and he goes up to 1000 in the stomach and he fucking rubs his blood on his shirt. That fucking acting. Think about that scene. He goes, we'll talk a little closer. I can ignore number to get a plan. He goes, really, motherfucker, this is the thing and this is for you, and he stabs him. Then he wipes the knife on his fucking shirt. You mother fucker. You motherfucker killing my family, bitch. He went back to the boat, took care of business.

Speaker 1:          02:11:00       What's a good one? I just don't know. I remember that. I do remember that part. The same people that like these movies always have, like the ringtone is somebody in the rack pack also. You know what? Like Dean Martin, is that what it is that with frank stallone likes to work out to music? No, it does. It does. He try to put it on a Justin's? Yes. What kind of music is he saying?

Speaker 8:          02:11:23       Album of coverage. Is it good shark bites? I need this. I need for you to sing this song. I've heard 30 million fucking times. Yeah. That's not necessary at all. No, he's on Lemon Jello. I don't need that shit. Peter. Who people want me to jail. That was the biggest scam of all life. Peter Lemon, lemon gentleman in the seventies, just marketing group. Wanted to try something and they took a fucking guy. His name is Peter Lemon Jello. Good looking blonde. Guy took his picture and one on every station and said, get the greatest hits of Peter Lemon Jello. Nobody. No. Pick the lemon. Jello. Watch what the fuck's be the lemon Jello, but those are his greatest hits by the fucking thing. He sold like a million copies. Nobody knew what it was. An album of just covers him singing merry Christmas and silent night. Peter Lemon, Jello. He was one album. Made him in the seventies, if you will, on TV marketing. How much it's changed. I think there's a media marketing. How much has changed in the seventies? Guy would go on TV. The greatest hits, they didn't have that much. Right. So you went back.

Speaker 1:          02:12:19       Well, how about when they tried to sell that dude who was playing the flute, the Pan Flute, master of the pamphlet. What was his name? Sam Fear. Zen Masters. Get the fuck. It's amazing that that has any effect on you at all. You're sitting at home slack, jaw and there's a dude playing the flute and you're like, fucking pamphlet. I got to get that.

Speaker 8:          02:12:42       Oh fuck. You Know Brittany Spears sells 10 million ounce.

Speaker 1:          02:12:48       Yeah, but at least that's like pop music. Do you kind of get. There's a lot of dumb teenagers out there. Sort of connects with the type of people that want frivolous dance music, but I don't get the pamphlet. There's a bunch of dudes would do like different master of the right. Yeah. And they sell them like in meditation places also fear. I bet a lot of dudes are pissed that he got that master of the pamphlet contract because you know, I mean, how many dudes were playing the pan flute going one day? That's going to pan out. The only guy panned out for was them fear. That fear. That's it.

Speaker 8:          02:13:22       When you pull the thing, a trombone

Speaker 1:          02:13:27       slide, slide whistle thing that you think in that Russell probably placed in this home, what would you say, please? This slide was. It looks like he would. I'm sorry. I'm just bitter with him. You don't like Russell brand? He said, Katie, is that what it is? You're upset about that. Really? Why are you a fan of Katy Perry? I Love Katy Perry. Do. If you had a chance, would you be with her? Of course I would do lover. I want to marry her. So you upset at Russell? I obviously didn't work out. Yeah it but don't get fucking married. Russell brand. He's also supposedly, he's English. He's Dick. Smells like shit. He's got fucked up teeth and he's trying to fuck her in the neck. That goes to 26 year old girl from fucking up north. She's a good girl. Good girl. And you treated her bad that she's fucking singer, man.

Speaker 1:          02:14:20       She's a famous singer. How do you know she's not crazy? Yeah. It might be just like a female comic. She just wants to talk about her songs all day and publicists and maybe she's nuts. You don't know. She comes in and puts that shit. Don't, don't play that role. Brian, how dare you. He uses the word telly. Telly. I liked when I say proper, it's a proper love. Russell restaurant. He's an animal. He's a proper funnels. He's 30 years old. He's 50, 50, 50 fucking years. You don't need to look really planners or did a lot of drugs. There's a lot of drugs. He's afraid you can't do nothing. Nothing bothered me. I like to get together. You let what you like to watch. That piece of shit. Why don't you watch your original one? The original one? The original ones. Great. There was no reason that we make that original is great. There's no reason to make it, but they did a pretty good job. It was a good movie. See the same exact character that he's in in every single day. Pretty much, but that's okay. So is a fucking Jason Bateman or not? It was the name. What the fuck's his name? The, the, the guy from the, the uh, the balding guy from England, Justin. Oh God damn the mechanic there. Jason. Jason, Jason, Jason say that. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. About a month ago to a mechanic isn't. There's nothing. I said to myself,

Speaker 8:          02:15:44       you know what, how can I put down a movie? I haven't seen a. and let me just take the Charles Branch and notion off. It might be a good movie,

Speaker 1:          02:15:53       right? Are you fucking kidding me? Just get mad at it. Oh,

Speaker 8:          02:15:57       he minutes in because that's the beauty of the mechanic. If you watch the original mechanic, it's the beginning. It's the longest dragged out scene of all time and it's one of the best hitch you'll ever see on film where he breaks into the guy's house and puts you to sleep and peace to a pills and the Dang. And, and what he does is he puts the gas on a shooter, so it looks like a fire. He did a very. And that's what I told people at the mechanic, wasn't about a guy blowing up things. It was about a 51 year old man that has to use his trades and he did everything. He didn't want it to seem like he was shooting. It wasn't a fucking act like, you know, if he would look

Speaker 5:          02:16:30       at your medical records, if you had a weak heart each shoot at your legs, so you would have to run. That's how he killed Jeremiah. Michael Vincent's father in that movie. I watched that thing with Jason Strand, Bro. No, no. Fifteen minutes. It went right off. It was a little too stylized and like the fight scenes like that. Vincent was trotting slams much. Jen might go. Vincent was a cool mother fucker walking into the room. Microphone jobs. Bronson was a cool motherfucker walking into the scene and I think that guy that played jam, Michael vintage rolls are good fucking. He's a great actor, but he overdid the role. Really? Yes. The role wasn't for a kid. That was crazy. It was for a kid that was spoiled to different vinyl. Maybe they played it crazy in this movie. You know when you're spoiled, when you're spoiled kid and your parents have a lot of money, you're spoiled like that.

Speaker 5:          02:17:21       That's what he was, you know, he was a bad ass in 30 days of night. Who's that guy? That same guy that played the Jan Marini is great and he's a good actor. I don't want them to remake and Charles Bronson movie. No, you know, no matter what you do, it's like you don't have to remake the movie man. How much? Just make another movie about a young man. Why can't I hit? Why? Yeah. Why can't you make another movie about a Hitman and just cause you guys rolling in his grave. You worked hard to be a scumbag. And Austin, this guy comes with his pretty face and shaved head and all of a sudden he's fucking shooting people by my fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Says what's up Joe Rogan go this week. Italian beef sandwiches. It's going to be off the fucking chain. The only ticket to the left folks are nosebleeds.

Speaker 5:          02:18:05       Are you serious? So I was left. People know the way back, I guess is a, it's a giant place with. It's like 3000, 200 people or something like that. It's huge. People driving from Canada. I'm going to have some fucking fun. We're selling. We made posters to Mike Maxwell. He's a, he's a serious fucking real deal. My Art Dot Com is a bad motherfucker. And Matt, Mike Maxwell, art on twitter, that's his twitter handle. And he's uh, he's coming with us and he's going to sign some posters too if you want to get your shit signed and we'll all sign it. Wall side. Get one brother ones when these crazy. We're going to have some fun. It's a killer. Pop. The card is sick man. There's a lot of good fights of the bisping Chael Sonnen fighting already talked about. Rashad Evans is going to take on Phil Davis. That's a good fucking.

Speaker 5:          02:18:52       I find. I like that fight a lot. That's a really interesting fucking fight. And Damien Maia is going to take on Chris Weidman. That's a good fight, right? And they took that fight on short notice, but that kid's a stud wrestler. Who knows how to put people to sleep, you know, he put Tom Law to sleep in the fucking with darce choke killer. He's a killer. And you know what? Matt Serra is a serious Jujitsu coach. You know, a lot of people don't remember that Matt Serra was at one point in time when he was competing and just straight grappling was right up there at the top of the fucking heap. He wanted decision over John John Machado, you know, I mean, he submitted a lot of fucking really good dudes. Sarah was a killer and just straight Jujitsu back when he was only competing in Jiu Jitsu before he. When you get into mixed martial arts, of course you have to.

Speaker 5:          02:19:41       You have to dedicate so much time to striking so much of your time to conditioning so much of your time to do all these different things that you know, your Jujitsu game doesn't get to express itself the ways, you know. He's getting involved in a lot of stand up fights and you know, sometimes dudes like they, one guy will take it down and hold onto you. It's you don't get to see it as if like it was a straight Jujitsu match where one guy only trying to submit you and you're trying to submit him. Then you get to really see a guy's Jujitsu and Matt Serra has some fucking top line Jujitsu. His Jujitsu is really tight man and you know, to have a guy like him teaching a guy like Weidman, you know, a guy was already fought mma many, many times. One the title, you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          02:20:24       Fought some of the best guys to have him teaching Weidman. You get a stud wrestler, a guy who has beaten, I believe he fought Phil Davis and rather wrestled filled Davidson, beat him in a straight wrestling competition, which is fucking crazy. Davis is an amazing wrestler. So weidman a killer wrestler and then on top of that he's learned submissions and on top of that he's just tough as fuck off his phone and he's all crazy with Jesus. He's another one of those dudes that's always crazy. Loves Jesus and he's like super religious and it's got that Jujitsu walk hand in hand. Yeah. Will they get that mad belief in themselves? There's something to be said for that. They used to scare the shit out of me when I used to fight like religious guys. I obviously think that religious guy, they always made me nervous like they had like a kind of confidence that fucking spooked and you can't beat them up because you feel like they got the fucking burn for an extra fucking week.

Speaker 5:          02:21:16       I wish you could come to Brazil. Joey. They start burning. They get a passport and started fucking. You've got to get a passport. Shit like that. Fucking people had the old country confused to Christianity. And how's that working for the Denver? Are they still in it? They ran into punches. Pilot. Who's punches pilot? The motherfucker from England. Tom Brady dumped his bitch when she was six months pregnant. Who's that? And not just dumped a bunch of fucking hot bitch and then jumped on the thing where he put the phones on. Tim Teebo his fucking head last week and this week ray Lewis went up there thinking he was going to the superbowl, stabbed somebody else, but you had a fucking stop up there too. They didn't cover the spread, but the under came

Speaker 7:          02:21:53       picker. You see that kicker lesson and the Patriot game? Is that what it was? The giant games. This clobbered. This kicker wasn't, didn't know you were supposed to go up or something. I don't know what the full story is. So at the last second he had to like run and kick the ball, you know, he was like on the sidelines they couldn't find them or anything and he missed it and I think that was like the kick that made them lose the superbowl or something like that. Oh my God. You got one job to do in the kitchen. And I was at that time he looked like suicidal and like fans were like, we didn't say anything bad to him because he looked like he was suicidal. It's like what some

Speaker 8:          02:22:26       of the quotes were saying fucking Bro. Izzy last week. Yeah, he's a white John Jones. Really? Six, five. I didn't know that. I was looking at him last week and his gift is his hearing. He lets them come around them and swat at them and all of a sudden this fucking dangerous because you don't even see it. Like if I was in my going down and maybe because I just am a punch. Motherfuckers do Brady Hammer Punch right from me. A bag. You want to take me down because I had dated. I dated a girl for my fucking thing. I will hit you with a hammer part that will crush your skull. Joe. They're putting their hands out. He so Paul, he stands in the pocket. You don't run. They don't move and he just watches and all of a sudden when that dude's phone that's then comes out man. And that motherfucker.

Speaker 8:          02:23:13       I mean he made me a believer a couple of years ago, but I was sitting on this six foot five bro. He ain't no fucking joke that do. When you see the guys around him, he's fucking tall. He's a big motherfucking strong. I was watching him. That's. He's got some kind of place eating that Brazilian chip that's to give you something. Does that help? What's that? Eating a Brazilian check made them a little crazy because she's fucking gotta. Be Crazy. If I was just out bumble, say whatever her name is.

Nowhere to go, so I hope that we do post an after party somewhere. So we're gonna. We're gonna. Have a party. We're going to see these people. I want to do that thing with Pete. The cop, the cop offered us some club and I'll announce it at the uh, at the actual shoe. Yeah. That's the best move for me to do nothing. And that's part of the fingers. These meet a lot of people though inside when we sell the posters to find. So it'll be cool, man. I'm going to feel for it. Before you leave, did you see that fucking cruise ship ship that sunk? Do you know those people? A bunch of people are dead. At least 20 people were dead. A bunch of people are missing or 12 people are dead. You are dead. They just found two or three more bodies last night. They're exploding a holes in it to today. You can get to more places

Speaker 7:          02:28:21       to find them. And I think there's 15.

Speaker 5:          02:28:23       Well, the cruise ship company started calling up the passengers saying that they would offer them 30 percent off their next vacation with them. That's nice. That's a great discount code. That's I imagine people that have jumped into the ocean to save their lives with their children. They should get free cruise for life. How would you imagine fucking cruise ship ever again? Fucking paid me. I went on one time to the cruise to nowhere in New York. Twenty four hours. I knew that shit wasn't trap. I don't like it at all. Oh, they got great food. They got nothing. They got fucking all you can eat and you gotta you gotta go out to the gallery. The smoke dope. No, no, no. Just leading me on dry fucking land. Anthony to Mia likes going on cruises doesn't mean. I don't know. I think he likes just going and getting hammered and going on cruises. I hate you. I don't. I can't get it. But the captain, the captain is totally to blame. Apparently. Just drove it into the rocks. This crazy. Yeah. So. And he jumped off for four hours before the last passenger got off. This asshole was off. Took her. He just took off. He crashed the fucking boat. Could you imagine you, you, you know, you spend billions of dollars and your cruise line keeping everything maintained perfect and some asshole drives your big and supposedly bus into a rock

Speaker 7:          02:29:39       and supposedly it was like something that same path that he did every day for years, but he got bored and said there was one part where you just wanted to do something different because you know, and so you went to a different way that you really. Yeah, because you can track it. You can track the crews on this website to see where boats go every single day. Imagine the audacity of

Speaker 5:          02:29:59       company to call you just a few days after, you know people lost loved ones. People. There's people missing still too, for a company to have the audacity to call you up and say, hey, we're going to offer you 30 percent off your next cruise just because we want you to. You know what the price of that cruise that you just almost died in. We're going to fuck it. Throw that out the window. How about that? We're going to race that. We're going to get like, they're so delusional. They think they're so detached, they think those people are ever going to get on a fucking cruise again. That fuck that man, that's you, you, you got a little piece of metal that's floating over an alien world and at any point in time something can happen and a whole could get punctured to that thing and then it sinks to the bottom of that era alien world where you can't live and then what are you in? Then you're in a little floatable raft bobbing around in shark soup and all this time

Speaker 7:          02:30:48       this has happened when Brendan Walsh and Doug Benson had been on this cruise ship with weed and like all these bands and stuff. This happened at the same time while they're online and you could know Doug's probably don't as an elegant way to, uh, Doug Benson and Brendan Walsh, or on a cruise ship. Yeah. With weezer and Wean and a bunch of people. It's like a, it's a weezer careers where they're just all in this huge boat. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:31:11       That actually sounds kind of see that, that, that made a crew sound. All right. If you can get a bunch of cool bands,

Speaker 7:          02:31:16       but you know, imagine Doug's just being on that boat with Doug [inaudible], you know, you're probably smoking shit loads of weed and you hear about that happening. You're probably like, oh my God, we're on a boat when it. Where are they? Where are they traveling? I don't know if you Google weezer cruise back yet. I think they came back yesterday. Yeah. All right. Let's bring this shit back around the harbor,
