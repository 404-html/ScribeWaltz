Speaker 1:          00:11          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13          Brian Post St Ladies and gentlemen just got done doing the podcast. You're hilarious. As always. Thanks buddy. Brian is one of those dudes that I've known for about probably 15 years or something like that. But I've been down here since. This is the first time we ever really sat down and were like a serious conversation for sure. But we talked when we worked together show. But yeah, nothing like that. Like the two hours. That was fun man. It was cool. Brian is no longer in the pot club. You folks, I'll be back. We caught him three months completely sober cause that's gotta be a weird thing to be like the POC community. He was one of those guys, one of them. I'm worth the metal community until somebody pointed out to me and I was like, yeah, you're right. Yeah. But uh, yeah, definitely don't do that many pot jokes, but it all kind of came from a plot place.

Speaker 2:          00:58          I mean, most of those jokes were written while I was high. And the thing, the important thing is that he's the one that indoctrinated duct Bateson who's probably the biggest pothead comedian. I mean nobody's connected more to pot as a comic than duck. It's like teaching karyotype about props like yes, exactly. But it's worse. These two things together and make fun of that. I did that. I wouldn't, I wouldn't say worse, but I mean it's bigger because carrot tops not spreading props all across the country and getting other people to do props. So that's done for that movie. Super High. Me. How many people got started smoking weed because of that movie? That a lot. Yeah, I've been a lot of people looked at that and go, what the fuck man? He looks fine. Print would bring up all over here. So this is if you, if you're upset and Doug done some monsters I guess. Yeah, I bet you did dude. You spawned it. Brian Post saying, ladies and gentlemen, thanks for being on the podcast. Thanks. Awesome. Thank you. Appreciate it.

Speaker 2:          01:58          Looks like that city and salt city. What's the, all this salt on the ground is actually what I get out of the tub. The tank rather, and it's also because a, at one point in time, back in the past I had a rupture in the lining and the saltwater leaked out and got over the floor and we had a wine and cleaning it out and doing a bunch of different things to fix it. New Tank from folate lab, float lab technology and so this all this shit on the ground. It's all just songs, Yolanda and all that. Now it's kind of boring. Our cane, Neil Brennan, thank you very much for being on the Poncho, man. Pleasure was all mine and get you into the isolation. It's in Venice. I'm going to call him for you. It'd be an awesome thing for you to sit and think of ideas.

Speaker 2:          02:52          There's no environment like that on the planet where you don't feel your body disconnect from your body and you're all inside your head. It's amazing. Pretty close to, I'm just walking around, I'm so in my head, but I, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a human isolation. Well in your head, in your head there would be no, I'm fucking here. When does it kick in? Well, it depends on how relaxed you know, how much you can let go. It takes a while to get comfortable with the experience cause it's so weird. I feel like I would cry. Does that make sense? You might cry. Have you ever cried? Not In there, but in real life yet. You have several times. Wow.

Speaker 2:          03:30          Oh no more than that. No person. No, I didn't cry your nap. No. It takes up more than a cartoon to get me to cry. Brown. A little bit of tears. Excuse me. First of all, it takes three d and live action. I kind of titanic like a motherfucker should really? Wow. That's twice I cried cause I paid $7 for that piece of like, did you really like titanic? Do you know what I liked about it when they were, uh, they did the flyover of the ship. When you look at the people walking and it's cause it's old CGI, they like still robotic. Yeah. I enjoy that about it. That's my favorite part of titanic. When everything looks fake like it. I thought it was a dumb move and I liked it. I liked it. I like the Capri. I would like it if it was just the thing crashing into the water because the special effects were awesome.

Speaker 2:          04:19          Other than that, no. You didn't like when he stenciled her, I would. It probably, that would have been that. Right, right. And I liked that she was naked and still like that was nice that you can think it. That's what an awful double standard the MPA has. Is that like she was tasteful naked right now, but she's still naked. I don't give a fuck. I still saw a woman's netball. Did you see her nipple? Yeah. I think I even remember whatever happened. That chick, she turned into a meet Bob Wright and she, no, she's all right. She got big. She didn't, she got you. That's good. Actually. Probably smaller than she was then Barilla. Yeah. Didn't she go meet bomb for a little while though? The Internet will agree with me. Christina Aguilera meet bomb. Wait, if you say anything negative about a lady, the Internet will agree.

Speaker 2:          05:03          Right, meatball or Kirstie alley and what a hog. Right. Whenever you ever look at her. When she was on cheers, she was so hot. Shit. Aye. The her first episode of chairs when I thought I was like, damn, like he's kind of big. She was a little big from it. He or she was wearing leather pants. I remember she was like purple leather pants and it's one of those acids where you just go, I don't, I think that's you don't like, it's too big for me. Uh, I like a size three. I mean not that is, I don't need this. That's how manly I am. I don't know. I just made that up, but uh, I don't like it. I like a nice ass. Got a great story about Mark Coleman. He was in the UFC heavyweight champion or hanging out once in a strip club. We had this girl said, I was laughing. He goes, she's only about 90 pounds.

Speaker 2:          05:51          And then he goes and puts, it got to be tight. That's how he was. He was breaking it down. She don't know nothing about so you can't have a loose, but say at that at that way class. He figured and he's a gorilla. Just got tagged or looking at rabbit.

Speaker 2:          07:33          Oh, it's mine. When Joey stopped coming to the comedy store, that's one of the things that killed it. She always stopped coming six months before the I got kicked out of their nose. When he stopped coming here, I was like, God, like what is right? He just fucking hated them. Yeah. It would just go by the fuck are we doing coming to this fucking shit or get angry at you. Come down and store and get the fuck out of here. That fucking place.

Speaker 2:          11:27          Why do they, when they call natives Indians, because I fucking retard was looking for my people. I said, I said, what are you doing on Columbus Day? Drive around until you don't know where the fuck you are. Anyway, it's true. I mean you had to talk about the GPS stuff. It's Columbus Day, how bad navigation was and how little they knew about what was out there in the world. They thought they were going to drop off the edge of the earth. They thought that they can get to the point there was in the ocean, wouldn't have a drop off and that would be, they fucking took a chance and they got all the way to America, you know, and thought they were in India, like there were so off. They weren't even really an American. They were in The Bahamas. Right then they went to The Bahamas was first.

Get home in my driveway. I pull into my driveway and I hear cut and my car liens, so I get out and the suspension has detached itself from the frame and the wheel is stuck in bent into the front fender and I'm like, that could have happened 10 minutes ago when I was in a highway that would be dead, so I got it all fixed. I got everything repaired and I got the shifts pension redone. No, no chip just designed it. Chip Foose just designed it and a guy named Troy Japan. Yay. Built it. Then I got a guy out here, Steve Stroke. He fixed everything. Did read to the suspension. I sold it. Got a Porsche gt three what? What? What does that it? It's in the garage fool, so I'll show him.
