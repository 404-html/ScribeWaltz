Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Four, three.

Speaker 1:          00:00:09       Welcome back man. Hey, thank you. Good to be here. Great to see you again. Yeah, I like your new spot. Thank you. Thank you very much. Ma'Am. You have a real flip phone. I do have a real foot said that you. You didn't go back to it. You've never left. I never left her. So you never went like iphone, android? Never. No. Never, never even thought about it. Never even thought about it. No. You see people taking pictures and using apps? Nothing. Nothing. Uh, I, I, I don't need the APP so I'm good. There's no draw at all. Nothing that using the internet to answering email. I have a laptop, I have a laptop at home and I do access the Internet, but when you're out you don't want to mess with it. No one of them out. I want to be out in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       You know, if you're, if you're looking at your phone, you're not in the world. And so you don't get either. You don't get either thing. He would get along very well. My friend Ari, he went back to a flip phone and he looks disdainfully sort of like a former alcoholics look it at everybody with a drink. Like there's no way you could just enjoy one drink you loser, right? Yeah. No, I, I, um, I just look around at this. I mean I'm an anthropologist and I am interested in human behavior and I look at the behavior like literally the physical behavior of people with, with smartphones and it doesn't, it looks I'm antisocial and unhappy and anxious and I don't want to be. I don't want to look like that and I don't want to feel like. I think those people feel, wow, that's deep.

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       I'm a junkie, you know? Uh, it's really interesting because, uh, I was at a restaurant the other day and I was looking around and literally everyone in the restaurant was looking at their phone. No one was talking to, to anybody. And I was thinking, what if there was a drug that did that? What if there was a drug that didn't kill you, but it just sucked up all your time and you just stared blankly at your hand. And did everything that you do while you're using a phone, people would be terrified, like you're staring at your hand and crashed into cars. You're staring at your hand and walking into Poles. Yeah, I mean, I mean there is a drug. It's that social media. I mean, I think the big lie of our generation is the phrase social media. It really isn't. It's antisocial media and it has a lot of uses and know whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       But it's not social in any human sense. And, and if you look at suicide rates, depression rates, ptsd rates, anxiety rates, they're doing nothing but going up in our society, mass shootings, you know, just something tragic just happened yesterday. I'm all those things. There are indicators of something and they're all going up in our society despite the fact that we're a very wealthy, powerful, relatively peaceful society. Like something's going on. I can't prove that it's, you know, the internet or social media, what I mean obviously, but, but the fact that those things are happening at the same time does make me wonder that these new devices certainly don't bring happiness because the numbers are going in the wrong direction. Well, I don't think they're designed to bring happiness, but there's certainly designed to give you access to information go perhaps, maybe

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       with some discipline they can be used in some sort of a way that that benefit

Speaker 3:          00:03:04       not. Well, yeah. I mean all of that information is available in your laptop at your desk at home. I think the problem is when, when people want to be socially, socially connected constantly, no matter what they're doing and that I think keeps people from actually fully experiencing whatever they're actually doing. I think there's definitely some truth to that, but I do like the fact that I can ask my phone questions like if I don't know anything and I can add a new feature on this Google Pixel, we squeezed the side of it and the Google assistant comes up and you can ask it questions. You squeeze it and ask a question. I mean, that's some space age shit, man, or it's downright creepy. I mean, you look at it, I mean, I, you know, I get it. I mean, you have all of human knowledge in your front pocket. Yeah. Accessible at every moment. Like I do understand the power of it and the appeal of it. I'm not saying there aren't great things about. Of course there are. Um, it's just, for me the downside outweighs the upside for other people. I guess it doesn't. But if you look again, if you look at mental health statistics in this country, we're doing something wrong because they're all going in the wrong direction. I agree with you. I just wonder if the mental health statistics are indicative of other issues.

Speaker 2:          00:04:18       You know, I think lifestyle, what you do with your time during the day, and I know a lot of people live a very deeply unsatisfying lives and I don't know if the phone accentuates that problem. I mean we were talking the other day about we were at the airport, we're waiting to fly home and there was some girl and she was talking, we were just ease dropping and she was talking about like the amazing race and how she, you know, this show so boring now and I can't wait to, I'm going to eat this and then I'm going to eat that and I, I'm supposed to get a raise at work. It's like all nonsense, non engaging, not interesting. There's no real life to anything she's talking about. And like this is most of our country or

Speaker 3:          00:05:01       a large part of our country. Oh absolutely. I mean the thing about social media is that it sort of weaponizes blend this, it allows, it gives people a platform for the most mundane, uninteresting aspects of their lives because they have to constantly, constantly be producing some kind of output of communication. Well and if not, producing it certainly absorbing it all right. Yeah. We were both feeling good

Speaker 2:          00:05:26       mining when I'm on twitter, like nothin, nothin, nothin, nothin.

Speaker 3:          00:05:31       Oh right. Oh murder. Oh look at this little monkey found. Oh, I mean there, no, I mean there's other people you could have on the show that could speak more intelligently to this, but I know that, I mean, I've heard that um, risk of suicide and face facebook are correlated. In other words, people that are are on facebook and in social media, they are at an increased risk of depression and thoughts of suicide and that and that. That's

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       terrifying. Do you think that that's correlation equals causation though? You know what I mean? Like, do you think that people on facebook all the time are doing that because they're already depressed?

Speaker 3:          00:06:06       Right? I mean, that's the question and what the correlation means. We have to look at something more closely. Yeah. Anxiety rates and teenagers have skyrocketed. Um, anxiety partly comes from a sort of a painful self awareness. And of course that's amplified by social media because you can never escape the opinions of your peers. I mean, that's crippling to people. I mean, we're not, you know, I wasn't the most popular kid in class by a long shot. And when, when I came home, whatever my whatever my issues were, were on hold until, you know, when I was a kid in high school, there was issues around hold till 8:00 AM the next morning. Right. You got a 12 hour break from your problems, now you don't. And it's really tough on kids.

Speaker 2:          00:06:41       Yeah. I can only imagine growing up today, I, you know, I think we got very lucky that the, we experienced the Internet in adulthood, you know, for me, I was, think I was 27 the first time I ever gone online and that's a nice, you know, and no one knew what online was back then. You weren't leaving any traces, you were just going out and looking at stuff. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:07:04       that's right. That's right. Yeah. I was. How old was I? I was about 36. I remember. I remember a girl asked me, do you ever logged on? And I say,

Speaker 2:          00:07:13       well, Donald, what? She had to explain to me what that meant. And then I literally said to all, that's never going to catch on. Come on. That's like a really. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, isn't that what they said about the first computers, like that was one of IBM's a initial reactions to the idea of the personal computer? I think that's the reaction to the first of everything except maybe the bow and arrow. I mean like when they invented the bone Arrow, everyone was like, no, that is going to catch on. That is cool. Right? But everything else, I think that's

Speaker 3:          00:07:42       skepticism. Like we don't, we don't need anything more. We're good. And then you realize, I mean that's the amazing thing about the human mind is that we invent this stuff and it doesn't mean that it's good. I mean we evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to live a very different environment that we live now. So these things that we invent, it doesn't mean that they're sort of psychologically good for us, but they definitely are incredible. I mean there are definitely amazing things.

Speaker 2:          00:08:05       Yeah. I don't think that necessarily they're good for us, but I don't think this is kind of sound weird, but I don't even think they're necessarily designed for us. I think they're designed for the future, I think, and I don't even think it's a design. I just think that all things move in an ever more complex direction and whatever a person is now is not going to be the same thing a thousand years from now or 100 years from now even. I think there's going to be some sort of symbiotic can actually train us in electronics like we're going to have it installed in our body.

Speaker 3:          00:08:33       Well that gets to a kind of profound question like what is the point of existence of human existence? What's the point of it? Is the point for as many humans as possible to leafs to lead safe human fulfilled lives? Or is it for the human race as an entity to produce the highest technological achievements and insights, you know? And, and I don't have a vote either way, um, but that it does sort of seem to be the question and that technology. I mean, we know does not lead to fulfillment and happiness, but it does lead design, topic, insight and to, you know, incredible. Um, under profound understanding of how the universe works in a physical sense.

Speaker 2:          00:09:14       Yeah. I wonder if what we're doing is just being caught up in the momentum of all this innovation and instead of like low using discipline or using some sort of a rational objective analysis of what it takes to be happy and then maybe pushing, pushing some of that stuff aside and engaging and actually physical activities, going out and doing things and making that almost like a prescription. Like, Hey, you know, look, let's look at your daily chart. Hey, you don't even get enough vitamins, buddy. Hey, you didn't get enough activity like you need. You need that in order to be in order to feel right, to feel, feel balanced.

Speaker 3:          00:09:52       Right. And it feeling right is the point of existence. Then iphone are probably not a good development. No. If the exchange of data, if the exchange of information is the point, then, then they're a great innovation. So it really depends on what we're all here for. I W I was in San Francisco with my wife and I were walking behind these two kids who were talking about about robots and one was they were sort of kids that were sort of sort of in the know about all this stuff and one guy was saying, you know, they're taking over, you know, in 50 years, you know, we're, we're, we're going to be, humans are going to be completely unnecessary, but I said to my wife, you know, we always were unnecessary, like none of this had to happen. It's not like the world needs. Human beings do exist and for some purpose, right? We just, we are here, but we didn't have to be here. And so if robots replace us, we go right back to where we would have been if we hadn't. If we hadn't evolved. And it was, it was just a funny way of thinking about it. Like none of this is actually necessary. It doesn't have to be happening.

Speaker 2:          00:10:51       No, it certainly doesn't. I mean, look, if we are finite life forms, if you're only going to be lived to be, if you're lucky, 90 years and when your health is going to fail and you're going to die, what was the, what should be our goal is to feel good, right? To have community in relation. That's a big part of that book. Tribe. Your, your book's fantastic by the way. I've read it twice and I read it again. I read it before. Then I read it again since, uh, since our first podcast.

Speaker 3:          00:11:18       You very much. Yeah, I've been getting a lot of. I keep getting a lot of good responses to it. And, and I think partly, I mean, whether you're a Democrat or Republican, this was a pretty unsettling time in this country. And um, and I, I think people are coming to the book a little bit just partly because they're wondering what is the glue that holds us all together and is there, it exists still. Like, I mean, I think there's a real question in people's minds about what is it that binds us together?

Speaker 2:          00:11:42       Well, there certainly is. And you really covered a lot of the sort of just not commonly discussed aspects of it, like the need for real community, the need to really, and the need to have something on the line now, the need to be in situations where there's real consequences and that it seems that this is part of the glue that holds us together.

Speaker 3:          00:12:09       I mean, the thing about technology is it buffers us from real consequences in the physical world, which is what's great about it, right? And uh, but the downside is that as you, as humans get buffered from consequences they need, they need each other less and less in order to survive. So now it's sort of modern modern homo sapiens in a suburban house with an iphone and a garage door opener and all that stuff. You know, you get a paycheck at work and you don't need your neighbors, you know, to, to get help. You gather food or hunt food or defend yourself from the gang, from the other neighborhood. I mean, it all kind of gets taken care of, which is a great liberation from your neighbors, from your community. But it deprives you of that essential human reliance on other people around you. That's what makes people feel good and safe and like they're leading meaningful lives. And so that transition to having a life that's not part of any community, um, that is a really tough one for people. And I think that's part of the reason for high depression rates and such in high ptsd rates in our society.

Speaker 2:          00:13:11       Yeah. I think that lack of community is a very confusing thing when you see most people just sliding into their garage and shutting the door, going into their house and they don't even know their neighbors. How that's really highlighted in your book how alien that is to the human experience until fairly recently. This idea of like living in these. Like I was in New York City this past weekend and there's enormous apartment, like my friend Jim was talking about this, he lived, Jim Norton lives in this enormous apartment building. Those, I don't know anybody there. And he goes, I live in a house, a building essentially a house with a thousand people. I don't know any of them.

Speaker 3:          00:13:46       Yeah. And listen, I mean I live in a little tenement building, but it's the same, same idea. There's a little cubby holes we all live in, but I, you know, I got to say, and I grew up in a suburb, but I got to say, at least in the building I live in, I'm in the lower east side, at least in the building I live in. I run into people in the landing and the staircase. There's no elevator in the staircase and you get to know them a little bit. The problem with the suburbs is that everything's a stone. You know, everyone's a stone's throw away behind a big hedge and you and you don't, you don't have to share an elevator with anyone. You can be totally isolated. And I grew up in that environment. It was crushing and, and I, you know, I was in a material sense, I was lucky we were affluent family, but I was not lucky in any human sets.

Speaker 2:          00:14:27       That's so fascinating. He say it was crushing to live the American dream. I mean, a lot of people's ideas. The American dream is living in a nice quiet suburb.

Speaker 3:          00:14:36       Yeah. I listen to. There's a lot that stream, like about it, but, but um, the, the data will tell you that people in those situations are not happy. I mean in, by the, the, the metrics by which we measure human fulfillment and human happiness, mental health, they suck in the suburbs. Um, and uh, and, and, and, and generally modern society is, as affluence goes up in society, the suicide rate goes up to the depression rate, ptsd, ptsd rate, all that stuff goes up with, with, with, without fluids.

Speaker 2:          00:15:07       Yeah. I've noticed that in some of the circles that I am hanging around with now because of Nice people, but the children of my children, my children's friends, parents, sorry, I am interacting with these people that I don't know from work, I don't know from social circles and just. And most of them are great, but a lot of them are on pills. Like a lot of like, like half of them are on pills. Pills, yeah. Yeah. They're, they're taking the adderall and then taking anxiety medication and they're taking antidepressants and they're mixing it all together with alcohol and some new freak out every week and there's literally no physical fear for anything. Everyone's driving a Mercedes. Everyone's living in a gated community. Everybody's. It's all smooth edges and corners. Everything is a very soft and easy and the. The big appeal seems to be the newest objects chase the newest objects.

Speaker 3:          00:16:12       It ends a really well known phenomenon that if you introduce a disaster into that environment, if you introduced the blitz in London or an earthquake or what have you, have flood tidal wave of war. People wake up out of their dream. I mean they're in a kind of dream state. I'm a part and for some people that's in, you know, induced by pills and some people it's just induced by isolation, but they're in a kind of dream state where they're not part of society in a meaningful way and a catastrophe wakes them up out of that. And, and people, I mean over and over again you can hear testimony of people saying, well, I really miss those days. The days after the earthquake, during the blitz, I mean, you, you from generation after generation that goes through there, there their things, right, there are tough things those days are missed and they're missed because people, the thing they actually like most is being an essential part of a small group that is struggling to survive.

Speaker 3:          00:17:06       Like that is the human experience for hundreds of thousands of years. We're wired for it. We're wired to like it. Uh, the people that responded to that challenge tended to pass on their DNA that people that didn't respond well didn't pass on their DNA were the descendants of the people that sort of took some thrill and from that challenge and, and acted well and with vigor and with community in the face of hardship and danger were the descendants of those people inevitably. And uh, uh, because the people that didn't act well didn't survive is as well, right? They didn't pass on their genes. And, uh, so that's one of the things we're missing in the big. The big trick is, I mean I'm not saying we're now in the suburbs band the car and live in a lean to, I mean no one would say that huge to this society too, but the trick is how can we have that close communal connection that buffers us from our, from mental health problems that makes us feel meaningful and fulfilled?

Speaker 3:          00:18:01       How can we have that and have the benefits of modern society, you know, like, can we do, can we do both? And I think that's the big challenge because what I see in America, I love this country, but what I see in my lifetime, I mean when I grew up, we didn't have mass shootings. I mean, you know, like that, that didn't happen. You go into a church with a machine gun and kill as many people as you can. Let's just didn't happen. What is going on? I mean to me it's a country in kind of. I mean those things are all a symptom of a country that's in the kind of psychic pain, you know, all the people on their iphones. I sort of get it but it. But also it makes me think you're anxious, like you're so anxious that you can't bear not to look at your feed for more than 20 seconds.

Speaker 2:          00:18:43       It's an, it's an addiction for sure. I mean, you're literally getting dopamine shots every time you check your feed and they're very small. It's a trickle. It's not like a real, like it's not really worth it. You don't get any real good feeling. Very rarely.

Speaker 3:          00:18:58       It's like fast food. Like the end of the end of it, you know, you go to the drive in, you know, get, get your cheeseburger and fries and a shake or whatever. Afterwards you're full, but you, you didn't get any nutrients. And, and social media is the same way. You're sort of socially full. But actually it's all calories that no nutrition. I mean there's nothing, nothing to sustain you.

Speaker 2:          00:19:19       Well, I've found for me personally that people get a lot of fulfillment out of tribes, for lack of a better word, of likeminded people doing similar things that are difficult. Absolutely. I see it amongst like rock climbers, a lot of rock climbers. They, they find like real community in other rock climbers and runners get it. Jujitsu. It's huge. And the Jiu Jitsu community horse, you know, um, and uh, I experienced it in a deep way. The first time I ever went hunting because hunting was almost like, like I had a wall that I didn't know. There was a door on it and I opened up the door and oh, there's a whole new area back here. Like your, your DNA like goes up. We know what to do with this. We're hunting now and you feel like, wow, this is crazy. Like this is lighting up parts of my brain or parts of my, my genetics.

Speaker 3:          00:20:11       Yeah. Listen, I went through that same door when I started boxing. I started late in life. I was 50. I go through a big life change. My first marriage ended and I needed something. I needed something a little different. And I think one of the things that really works for people is a situation where they're evaluated for their behavior rather than for how and where they were born. Yes. Right. So or how much money they have, which is a fun, you know, it is a function of a to some degree of how, how you were born, where you were born. Uh, and yeah, but so, you know, in high school you evaluated for the family, you come from, how you look for all that stuff. You don't have control over any of that stuff. But in the boxing ring out hunting, you know, whatever, there's a million things like this, you're evaluated by your peers for your conduct and that you have complete control over soldiers the same way, you know, and I was with this platoon in combat for non, for a year in eastern Afghanistan.

Speaker 3:          00:21:08       Those guys didn't care if you're a good luck with your bad looking if your dad was in prison or not really give a shit right? That what they cared is how you acted in that situation. And would you, would you, would you put the group, the welfare of the group ahead of your own welfare? And that was his basic human basic human question. Is the group more important to you than you are to you? And if we all answered that question with a yes, then we're good. And so you know, when you're in situations, hunting in the gym, Jujitsu, whatever it is, where you're not bringing your street identity in there, you're just, you're just a human being trying to act as well as possible with dignity and respect for others. You're good and it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you suck at Jujitsu, right? As long as you have that basic respect and hard work ethic and being freed from those things you're not responsible for and so and are not judged for it. That is a huge liberation and it really makes people feel close to each other.

Speaker 4:          00:22:06       Yeah, so people need mom and it's also. Do you think that a lot of what's going on today is just the fact that I don't think people are supposed to work in an office all day. I think it's probably bad for your biology. I think it's sitting in a chair all day is terrible for you. I think staring at a computer all day is terrible for you. All these things that people do or just counter to their contrary to what your body was designed for and that must cause a lot of depression and anxiety in people.

Speaker 3:          00:22:36       Yeah, I mean, if you, if you want to know what we were evolved for, you can look at current modern day hunter gatherers who more or less anthropologists agree represent our evolutionary past and you'll find that there's at least two hours of pretty vigorous movement everyday. You know, fast walking basically two hours a day by virtually everyone in the community. Um, you are almost never out of contact with, uh, I mean out of physical products, proximity with other people that you know extremely well. There's about four or five hours a day devoted to survival, food gathering, that kind of thing. We work eight, 10 hours a day, right? The most, quote primitive hunter gatherers and some of the harshest environments in the world spend around four hours a day surviving. But it survival is a group endeavor. It brings everyone together. Everyone's needed high protein, low no processed foods obviously. Um, uh, I mean, the Diet, obviously it's a very pure diet. Um, and people who live like that have extraordinarily good health, um, and if they survive childbirth and those first early years, I'm often live into their, into their seventies, eighties to 90. I mean, you know, West Bay basically live as long as westerners do with no medical intervention. I mean, it's pretty extraordinary. That is externally

Speaker 2:          00:23:57       when you think about it. I mean, what I saw an article and I didn't, I didn't read the article, but the headline was something along the lines of I was talking about artificial intelligence and it was a, whether or not the rise of artificial intelligence will, uh, will even out inequality. And I remember looking at that and one boy that's like giving into the hive mind, like artificial intelligence is going to cure all the woes of the world. Like we'll let the computer thing for you and everything's going to be even.

Speaker 3:          00:24:28       And you know, now that I'm thinking about it, the two guys, we were walking behind San Francisco, it wasn't robots, it was artificial intelligence they were talking about. I mean obviously they're connected. But yeah, it was, it was ai and, and um, you know, it's, I mean it's either ai is either the final blossoming of the human mind or it's the end. I don't think anyone knows which it is. It could easily

Speaker 2:          00:24:48       be the end. I've been thinking for the last few years that it's, we're some sort of electronic caterpillar is giving birth to some new butterfly. What we're doing is we're, we're the biological thing that makes the electronic thing and that the electronic thing is going to go, thanks, we got it now. And then we assume that the things that we hold dear, like emotions and comradery and this feeling that we have community, that that's important.

Speaker 3:          00:25:15       But

Speaker 2:          00:25:17       if we live and we die, it's important to us while we're alive. But what if we didn't exist? Is it important in air quotes to the universe? Is it important to the planet? Not necessarily just important as a human

Speaker 3:          00:25:31       understanding of physics, is that it was incalculably unlikely that the universe would exist and that life would start on this particular planet or on any planet. That it was extremely unlikely that even the universe would exist and um, so it's hard to say that anything would be important to add to it, to a system that, that, uh, statistically shouldn't have happened and that doesn't have a conscious and moral mind behind it. Like, I mean, no, of course we're not important. I mean if we were sitting on the moon and you watched a nuclear exchange between Russia and the United States that obliterated civilization, if you were sitting on the moon, you'd barely be able to see it. You would barely notice anything happened. Right? That's the moon. And that's pretty close. Of course it doesn't matter. So keep in mind that all those emotions, everything we are had survival value in our past or we, that we wouldn't have those things, right?

Speaker 3:          00:26:30       We're, we're, we're the legacy of an evolutionary process that went on for 2 million years. So if we feel sadness, if we feel anger, if we feel shame, all of those things had survival, survival, value for humans. And the individuals that had the capacity for those emotions made better citizens within their little community. We're better hunters were better, whatever, and so those emotions, we find them meaningful, but actually what they are is they helped us survive and now we have so altered our circumstances that survival is no longer a question. And so what do we do with those feelings? What did we do with those capacities? The ability to hunt that the dopamine that you get from hitting a target. I mean, teenage boys will sit in a basement for hours, days, years playing video games to practice their training for hunting right there, turning for hunting and war and they're getting rewarded with dopamine, which is exactly what should have been happening for 500,000 years. And now there's nothing to hunt, nothing to fight. They're still doing the behavior as they should because they're wired for it, but there's no useful purpose for it and they're making themselves irrelevant. They're human casualties of this technology and it's, I find it really tragic.

Speaker 2:          00:27:46       Are they more irrelevant than someone who plays sports?

Speaker 3:          00:27:51       I mean, I think our relevance comes from our, um, our relationship with our community and our society. And I mean, at least if you play sports, you're part of, you're part of the human community. And, and when you're in, when you're playing a video game by yourself, you're really not

Speaker 2:          00:28:08       by yourself. But a lot of kids, what they're doing now is they're playing these online games at playing against other people. They talk to each other online. They have headsets and they get, I mean, east sports is a big growing thing and it's, um, I mean it's, it's a fascinating thing because it's also sort of based on your ability to perform, you know, the ones who are the heroes are the ones who are like, um, when I was playing quake, there was this dude named fatality was, uh, his name. He just killed everybody was awesome, but it was, you know, he was the, he was the king because he was just the best at the game. So in the community of people that were only judged by their performance, he had risen to this very high level, but it was a community.

Speaker 3:          00:28:52       Well, you know, if you look at humans, you look at chimpanzees, we clearly need the proximity of others, like the physical proximity about it. So yeah, I mean the only way I can evaluate that is to say that's an that's awesome training for hunting and war and the military does use those games to train their soldiers and so I get it. It's effective. What I would do is look at suicide and depression rates and gamers and see are they above or below the national average for that age group and if they're above then there's a problem. Either depressive people are seeking that as a refuge or that activity makes people withdrawn and depressed and you know like either way it's a problem that needs to be solved that I have no idea what the data is, but that's where I would look.

Speaker 2:          00:29:32       Now, when you're researching all this data and you're putting together a book like tribe in your, you're putting it out, are you thinking to yourself that you have know that it's

Speaker 4:          00:29:41       not just an interesting study on human behavior, but it's also probably important for people to read, to kind of get an understanding and these, uh, to get an understanding of what it is it's causing people to have all this depression and anxiety that it may be. This is, this is something that needs to be said.

Speaker 3:          00:30:00       I mean, any categories, category statement I shouldn't make, but a lot of authors when they write books, it's their firm conviction that their book needs to be read by the public and that will help the public in some way, right? It will eliminate life illuminated America, luminate the world in some way. That's important. I mean, that's just a starting point for the two years of work that a book takes, right? You have a child. Your assumption is the child is going to be a good person in the world. Not a terrible person winds up shooting up a church, right? It's just a starting basic assumption. So for me, when I was writing tribe, I was trying to make sense of a number of different number of different things. I mean, one was that what the soldiers I was with in Afghanistan, I was really struck some months later that a lot of them wanted to go back to this sort of flea, bitten godforsaken outpost where they got shot at it every day and didn't want to come home to the US.

Speaker 3:          00:30:48       It's like that needs explaining. Yeah. Right. Um, and it made me think of this uncle that I had sort of surrogate uncle named Ellis Ellis settle. He was, um, he was Lakota Sioux and Apache is born in 19, 29 out west. And um, he had a very rough, interesting life and he's very well. Right? And I remember him telling me he was a sort of mentor figure for me and I remember him telling me when I was in my twenties, said, you know, all throughout the history of the United States, along the frontier, and this is how he put it. He said white people were always running off to join the Indians and the Indians never ran off to join the white people. And so here was this fact again, like, oh no one wants to go, go back to or go to the sort of modern world.

Speaker 4:          00:31:32       This wasn't even the modern world. This is the modern world in 18, 65,

Speaker 3:          00:31:36       right, or eight or 17, 55 or whatever. I mean at the, at the, the, um, right at the time it was the modern world, right? Uh, but so no one, no, it's basically the post agricultural, really a revolution world, the industrial world, the world of organized religion, organized government of, of uh, an industrial economy and an agriculture based system where people had jobs and you got up at dawn and plowed the fields all day and went to bed and your minister and your king told you what to do and you know, whatever. That's the modern world. And that's what nobody wants to be part of, including the soldiers I was with at Restrepo. Right. And so it just made me think maybe what the soldiers are missing isn't war, although that certainly has its charms for some people, but it's community is that they were with each other community with consequences.

Speaker 3:          00:32:29       That's right. Exactly. Community with consequences. Likewise for the native Americans were the tribal societies in North America, maybe with the young men, young men and some young women along the were looking for was an escape from the sort of oppressiveness of the congregation on Sunday mornings, the oppressiveness of the society that they were toiling in the regimented nature of an agric agrarian society. Maybe what they longed for was the closeness and freedom of a, of a tribal society. And indeed, I mean, there was this incredible sort of hemorrhaging of people from the frontier to the, to the tribes and some and even when people were kidnapped on rates, uh, by the Indians kidnapped from their log homes along the frontier and, and abducted and forcibly adopted into these tribal societies. Um, when, when given the chance to come home to be repatriated some years later, very often these people refuse to go. They didn't want to go back, they wanted to stay with their adopted, tried their adopted community. That, that is, that's amazing to me. And it says a lot about what the way humans are wired to

Speaker 4:          00:33:40       wanted to live, you know, that's, that was one of the craziest aspects of your book that I'd never heard that before. And how many people had done that. They were, they, they were kidnapped and then they said we like it here better. Yeah, that's right. And again, we're talking about more than 100 years ago. So we think of as modern society today is the only escalated those anxieties and woes and all the things that separated them from the tribal world.

Speaker 3:          00:34:04       That's right. And one of the things about tribes is there, there are sort of inherently egalitarian. It very hard to pass on pass on wealth and a non capitalist society in a mobile nomadic society is impossible to pass on wealth because you can't carry it. I mean, there's no way to carry wealth when, uh, when you're in a nomadic hunter gatherer society. So, so they're very, very egalitarian and they also guard against the sort of abuses of power, sort of one alpha male trying to sort of like bully people and take more than his share or for that matter, people sort of freeloading and not contributing to the group survival effort and sort of scamming a little bit of food here, a little bit of whatever they're. Both of those sins against the community are really harshly punished. So it's very galitary. Ian and I got a Galitary aneurysm is something we are all wired for it.

Speaker 3:          00:34:55       Right? And I think one of the distresses of a modern capitalist society is that it can't be a Galitary and um, and, and, and that's, that's painful for people. But then if you introduce a crisis, um, the blitz in London, for example, uh, an earthquake in Italy that I studied, um, what happens is that money doesn't matter anymore when the floodwaters are rising, when the bombs are falling, social class doesn't matter at all in it. It's like being in the, in the boxing gym, how you conduct yourself with respect to the others around you is actually what gets evaluated in a, you know, a poor man can be brave and generous just as easily as a rich man. There's no advantage to being wealthy or powerful when it comes to those basic human qualities. And that is a huge liberation. And so I'm, you know, I live in New York City and after nine slash 11, there was a bit of that in New York City.

Speaker 3:          00:35:45       I mean, you know, there's a lot of more people in New York, a lot of rich people, you know, whatever. Obviously we all know that, but after nine slash 11, no one was rich or poor or anything. We were all New Yorkers wondering if there was going to be another bomb dropped on us. Basically another attack on the city. So what happened in New York, the suicide rate went down. The, the violent crime rate went down. Vietnam vets in New York said, who had pete, who suffered from Ptsd said that their symptoms disappeared after nine slash 11. Everyone was needed and people and everyone for awhile, everyone was equal because we were all facing some danger that terrified us and that for all of its tragedy, that is an intoxicating social state to be in for human beings.

Speaker 4:          00:36:27       That's so bizarre. It's so bizarre, but it's also so make sense. One of the things that I also thought was fascinating in your book where you were talking about ptsd, Ptsd sufferers and how people in these veterans hospitals would be absolutely furious if they thought someone was faking their symptoms and that, that they, they had to be physically restrained to keep from attacking people that they thought were just joking the system and how many people are on ptsd benefits.

Speaker 3:          00:36:56       Yeah. I mean the numbers are really elusive, but. Well, you know what I have sort of anecdotally from veterans as well as people within the va, the Va administration who were acting as therapists or whatever a group counselors is that there's certain number of people and I, you know, I don't know what the fraction is, but there's a certain number of people who were not traumatized in war and ptsd is hard to prove or disprove and it's, you know, so obviously wide open for um, either an unintentional misdiagnosis or an intentional misrepresentation, whatever. And so I mean, of course, and any bureaucratic system gets scammed and pts deep benefits are no different. And, but it really is traumatizing. I mean seriously angering and traumatizing to soldiers who really were traumatized because they really were in combat. And keep in mind only about 10 percent of the US military experiences direct combat.

Speaker 4:          00:37:51       How would they know if someone was seriously traumatized? And the other thing that's fascinating is that as you were talking about in these small societies, free loaders are looked down upon as are the greedy Alpha males and try to dominate the wealth like that. The in these societies like egalitarian ideas are a much more, much more openly expressed. It's much more important that this is represented by these people that are legitimately suffering. Seeing someone was scamming the system and angry. Whereas say if you had a hurt knee or something like that and you were going to a doctor and you saw someone who was faking a back injury, you wouldn't be upset right where they were just robbing money from the insurance company and getting free.

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       Well yeah, there's a hurt knee doesn't have a sort of emotional cargo to it. Right. But combat does. I mean if you're in combat and you lost your best buddy and you got trauma from that as well, you should. Um, and then you're in some group therapy thing at the va with some guy who was in a rear base the whole time and is claiming 100 percent ptsd disability for some that never happened. Like, yeah, that would make you angry. It makes me angry because combat, this is extremely emotional and he get, I don't know, is it one in a million? One in 100, 100,000. I have no idea what the rates are and I'm not even sure what the va does and there's, there's, you know, in some ways incentivized not to find out, but, but it's, I am, I can tell you from like the real deal combat vets that happens, they smell it instantly and one way it gets sorted out is that those guys who are misrepresenting themselves get questioned by the combat vets.

Speaker 3:          00:39:26       Holy. So what unit were you with? Like he said, what happened exactly. Oh, a mortar hit the other side of the base. That's a pretty big base. I've been there, you know, it was a mile away and you're traumatized. Are you kidding? Like, you know what I mean? They'll get questioned. Right, right. Um, so I mean, like you, my question, someone who's bullshitting you about how much you know, how much a fighting's done with MMA or whatever. I mean, wherever your area of expertise is, I'm sure you can smell a fraud instantly. Right? Well everyone can. That's one of the things is one of the characteristics of humans because it, because we live in collective societies where we have to sort of trust one another. We're extremely good at smelling out misrepresentation and fraud were really, really good at it and it's one of the things that feels intolerable is to have someone who was unfairly gaining, gaining from the hard work of the rest of us. And, and, and I should just say, when I say a Galitary aneurysm, I don't mean that there's no hierarchy. Right, right. I mean it's complicated. Systems need hierarch need to order, right? Need Heart. I mean groups need hierarchy so that not everyone's a general. Not everyone's a private. I mean you need organization within the group, but I'm Galitary Ian means that nobody gets extra rights, you know, like all have the basically the same rights in the group. That's what that means. It

Speaker 4:          00:40:43       meaning, it all completely makes sense. It particularly makes sense. The idea that these people who were real combat vets who saw real action would be instantaneously able to discern whether or not someone was faking it. Yeah. Yeah. And that this. But that, this sort of mirrors what you were saying about these small tribes that in these small tribes, someone who's a freeloader is a extremely dangerous to the group. You'll look at it as a liability he looked at as someone who just can't be trusted and you need trust. You need community. And this is, this is what you're saying about a combat troops that what they want to know is that you're going to be willing to put your own safety secondary to the safety,

Speaker 3:          00:41:25       the troop. Right? And if everyone does that, everyone is safer. But if

Speaker 4:          00:41:29       no one, if some one person doesn't do that, I mean, that's always in the movies, right? It's always the one guy who runs away or the one guy who sells out or.

Speaker 3:          00:41:39       Yeah, that's right. And you know, those, those human themes are enduring and very powerful. So sometimes speak to a lot of liberal audiences, right? And, uh, and so I, I love doing this to them. Like, Oh, I'm a Democrat, so I sort of know those people pretty well, right? I grew up in Massachusetts and I get it, you know, and so, uh, it all, I'll say to them, okay, who hears it gets war and doesn't want to know anything or have anything to do with war and Dah, Dah, Dah. And of course everyone raises their hand, right? And um, and then I say, okay, who here has paid money to go be entertained by a Hollywood war movie? And everyone raises their hand. It seems like a contradiction. But when I go onto say to them is, look, if, if, if work and get a room full of passivist to go pay money to watch it, it's, there's something important going on in that narrative.

Speaker 3:          00:42:27       It's not a, you're not going to the movies to watch people get killed, right? You're not a sociopath. You're going to the movies to see these very ancient human concerns of who's loyal to the group, who's a coward, who's brave, who's willing to risk their life for someone else. I mean, these are, these are things that have kept humans alive or endangered them as the case may be for a million years. Of course they're compelling narratives. And in war you see those things happen, like in a sort of accelerated intense rate. I mean, you know, I grew up in a suburb. You almost never see someone have to choose between their own safety and the community. It never happens. That's the problem with the suburbs in war that happens every moment, every day. Right? So, so it gives you this sort of like human narrative in this incredibly compressed intense form which reconfirms the value, the human values we all have about, okay, if you're in a group, you have to love that group. Even if you're, if you disliked some of the people in it, like that's what it means to be part of a group. And that's what has kept humans alive for a very long time.

Speaker 4:          00:43:32       Even see that narrative in science fiction, futuristic movies like the Matrix right there, the one guy who sells out the other humans to the, to the Matrix and just says, look, I want, I want to be in the matrix. I want to have a great life and eat good food. And

Speaker 3:          00:43:48       yeah, I mean, listen, once you, once you are aware of this narrative, you see it everywhere and I mean, one part, there was some research that I did that didn't actually make it into the book. I couldn't quite fit it in, but I, I, I interviewed someone who had a consulting firm in Hollywood that did basically sort of like market research for the big studios and they would, they would screen films for audiences and then ask the audience's questions about the ending, about the characters, about how to construct the plot. They would sort of trying to figure out what's the public one is c, right? So what they found was that in disaster films, very typically, um, we're a community was facing a, a disaster, right? A plague or uh, you, uh, um, you know, a flood or a war or whatever when, you know, when the community had to rally to survive, right?

Speaker 3:          00:44:37       An alien invasion. But what does a million scenarios. But it's all the same basic story. You have these different characters. There's usually a, a male figure that takes the lead to difficulty defend the space. Right. There is often a female figure that's connected to him that sort of takes place of the, of the community that's being defended, take, takes care of the dresses, the wounds, dresses, the emotional wounds, I mean turn takes care of all that stuff while the man or the men are sort of physically defending the place there's. And then there's a guy who offered was really wealthy or well off before the catastrophe, who's continuing to act in a self serving way even during the catastrophe, when everyone's needed and everybody gets mad at that guy. That guy always dies, always dies. And then there's another character. And again, this is just very common in these narratives and easily Beta male.

Speaker 3:          00:45:38       Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. No, but keep in mind that these narratives of Ford by public opinion or this isn't the studio, is trying to make the public, um, force, feed the public like gender roles and you know, whatever this is the public saying. I like that. I don't like that. So the studios are responding to the questionnaires that these researchers give out. So one of the really interesting things, and this is totally inflammatory, but the role of the person defending like fizzle, you physically defending the community when they try to put a woman in that role, people have a problem with it and, and, and frankly often women have a problem with it. Like it's really, it's really, really interesting and women are just as important as men in a crisis or in anything, right? But the, what the public seems to want is the guy with the sword and the woman with the bandage, you know, or, or, or with the sort of reassuring, you know, like it gets divided like that and it's not, again, it's not the studio's forcing something on people as the people watching these films saying just voting on what the narrative that they like best.

Speaker 3:          00:46:43       But the, the other characters that I thought was really hilarious. There's often that, there is a, an estranged husband who's betrayed his wife and family in some way. He's on the outs, right? Uh, with his family and his, with his wife. And then the crisis happens. The martians invade the floodwaters rise, whatever it is. And he comes to the rescue and does the right thing and saves his wife and family and maybe even the wife's new boyfriend. I mean he even could have gotten to that stage. Right. And because he does the right thing, she takes him back.

Speaker 3:          00:47:14       God, it's funny, man. It's really just playing out these ancient archetypes to exactly what it's doing. I mean they read, I mean, those storylines resonate because they're ancient and because those, those roles in society helped us survive. And there's always the woman who in absence of the strong male figure rises to the occasion herself when some of the research I did with tribe, what I found, I studied this coal mine disaster in Canada. So it was all men trapped a two O, two miles down in these collapsed passageways in the miles. Two miles down, two miles down a, an angled shaft down. Yeah. So they had an explosion. Some gases ignited and the passageways collapsed. So they're two miles in their gaslight. Their, their, their, their batteries. Last, you know, 24 hours. Their water last 48 hours. Pretty soon they're just sitting in darkness. Not Knowing, not only if they'll survive, not knowing if their bodies will ever even be recovered, they no way waveness sitting in darkness trying.

Speaker 3:          00:48:12       So whoa, this is what happened. I mean obviously a situation like that takes needs leadership. So in the first minutes and hours there were these sort of Alpha males that weren't necessarily crew bosses, right? They didn't, they weren't within the traditional hierarchy. They were just guys who grabbed a pick ax and a shovel and said, come on guys, we're going to try to dig our way out. And they basically, I mean literally attacked the problem of these collapsed mine shafts. It, there was too much rubble to dig through. There were two miles down. So. So they, they, they, they dig, dug and dug and dug and it required these, these guys. And again, it was all men down there, but there was one sort of leader. Was this very aggressive. He didn't care what anyone else felt. Oh, you're scared. I don't give a shit.

Speaker 3:          00:48:57       Grab a shovel. We got to solve this problem. Like totally unempathic. Right? When they realized they couldn't dig their way out and they ran out of batteries and they're sitting in darkness, a new kind of leader was required and that was someone who was able to keep people's spirits up. Who is empathic, who listened to. The guy was really scared, was able to say, hey listen man, it's gonna be all right. It's okay to be scared. We're all scared, you know, that kind of voice. It's a different kind of leadership. Now. Typically in society, the male role would be the guy with the pickax attacking the problem. The female role would be the person sort of like trying to keep the group emotionally together and, and um, and functioning. And, but what happens in a, in a situation where there's all of one sex, those gender roles will be filled no matter what.

Speaker 3:          00:49:50       It would just be filled by people of the same sex. So if it was all women down there, someone, one woman would have grabbed the pickax and taken on what would be typically considered a quote male role. But she's female. So the gender roles that society needs to survive in adversity, in war, in nature, in a collapsed coal mine. It needs both gender roles, but either sex can fill those roles. It's amazing. And we will sort it out. So it doesn't matter who's male and female. What matters to that? Those two basic kinds of leadership and caretaking get taken care of. Wow. So how did those guys get out? They eventually. The rescuers eventually got to them. How long were they down there for? Over a week. I might even been two weeks. I mean, they, they, oh, oh, eight days. So I can't remember.

Speaker 3:          00:50:40       Actually. It's something, it's something like a week. Uh, how did they survive? I mean barely. I mean, you know, they, I mean, they ran out of water. They were, they were eating the bark off the timbers. Uh, the, you know, the support structures, they were eating coal. I mean, you can call. We're trying to. Yeah, they were drinking their own urine. I mean, you know. Yeah. And they, the guys died. I mean, not everyone survived. I'm one guy was trapped. His arms trapped between two collapse timbers and they were, you know, it was a pretty lively conversation about and he was begging them to cut his arm off so that he could at least be free and there was a pretty lively conversation with the other men in the group. Like did we do that or not? Right. And they decided not to do that.

Speaker 3:          00:51:18       If they, all they had was an acs. They're like, we chopped his arm off and free him. He might die from that. Right. And he was removed from where those guys were. So he was lonely. That was the thing. He was lonely. He was like, cut my arm off. I want to join you guys. And they didn't any, any died. Oh, amazing. Amazing sentence. Yeah. And so, you know what I mean? Not to whatever to steer this conversation too much, but I mean that's a, that's a microcosm in some ways for America, right? I mean every country is potentially trapped in a coal mine trying to figure out how to survive. We don't know. I mean the day before nine slash 11, we didn't know like 9:11 was coming, right? We don't know what's coming. Right, and the only way for any group of people, whether you it's $330, million or 18 people as it was in the coal mine, the only way for any group of people that to survive is to act collectively.

Speaker 3:          00:52:11       Right? Humans don't survive in nature by themselves and so in that coal mine, both kinds of people were needed. They happen to be all men but it didn't need it. Whatever. It doesn't matter. Gender doesn't matter. I mean sex doesn't matter. They need to both kinds of people. They needed aggressive Alphas that attack the problem and didn't care how people felt and were interested in like strict law and order and the group, you do this, you do that. You do what I say is a survival. You needed those kinds of people and you needed the other kind like, hey, we're going to be all right. Are you feeling okay? Yeah, we're, you know, like that kind of collaborative, empathic person. You needed that also. So when you look at the politics in this country, you need both conservatism and liberalism, right? You cannot, I mean a completely conservative America will be well defended, right?

Speaker 3:          00:53:03       No one's going to mess with us, right? America first, like no one will mess with us, but what will let, what will be left unaddressed is some of the internal dynamics of this country, um, which is frankly not at the foremost of conservative thought. I mean sort of racial disparity, economic disparity and all that stuff. Like, you know, I mean, that's not at the foremost of the conservative agenda and it shouldn't be. It doesn't need to be, it doesn't need to be because it's the forefront of the liberal agenda. And God forbid you have a country that's completely run by liberals. It'll get overrun immediately by the nearest armed neighbor. Right? What'd you. Liberals just aren't wired that way to be suspicious of the world. But what it, what liberals do quite well is to try to figure out a sort of system of fairness within the group that gets it.

Speaker 3:          00:53:49       Know it's just tries to equalize things and get everyone to sort of participate in to be valued and taken care of. Like I mean that it's all lovely, right? I mean that's needed also and so that every country is at its best when you have both of those dynamics going on and they're in a kind of dynamic tension with each other, but neither completely takes over. One of the things that breaks my heart watching this country is, is there's this idea on both sides, on the liberal side and on the conservative side that the other not only is totally wrong, but it's totally immoral and shouldn't exist, right? It's just not true in this country is not going to find peace until both sides of the political equation sort of reach across and shake the other person's hand and say, look, I disagree with you on almost everything, but I'm glad you're with us. I need you and I need to because I don't think like you do. I need you to think like you do and until this country figures out how to do that, we're going to be in this sort of awful partisans strife that eventually will destroy us. I bullets are not going to take down this country words well and they're going to be our words and it just breaks my heart to see this dynamic not only going on and on, but getting

Speaker 4:          00:54:55       worse, worse. It does seem to be getting worse and worse. And what's seems to be new is the idea from the liberals to silence people on the right and to, to think that free speech is important. What's important is their ideas and that their ideas are especially. I think now that trump is president and I think people feel even more emboldened

Speaker 3:          00:55:18       locked up in this. I mean, listen, I mean, I think it will. I mean honestly, I think it's equally both sides, but I. But I agree with you. I mean, the problem with the right with the left for me, and again, I'm a Democrat, so I, you know, I love evaluating my own size problems because they drive me. They make me more upset than the right wing's problems, right? Because because they're my people. Right. And I'm like, come on, can you, can you act a little better?

Speaker 4:          00:55:39       Pleased to see the irony though, that you've chosen a tribe and that tribe of people that you don't even know that these people are just. It's a political tribe.

Speaker 3:          00:55:47       Well, I mean, listen, I, I share those political, some of those political ideals and the conservative ideals I don't, I don't share, but I would hate to live in a country that didn't have conservatives in it even though I disagree because I disagree with them. I don't want to be surrounded by people I agree with. Right. And there are conservatives to do not want liberals in this country. Right. Shame on them. Sure. And likewise for liberals come in here and on both sides. So I think both sides tried to silence the voices of the other side. Frankly, I don't, you know, that's, that's a sin. I think that's committed equally on both sides. But one thing I wanted to bring up, because I actually made mistake last time I was on your on your show, I mentioned a book and I got the name wrong and it's such a good book and I wanted to, I just saw on twitter that people trying to find it and they couldn't because I got the name rock, it's called our political, our political nature, and by a guy named Avi Tushman and he collected an awful lot of data about the fact that political opinion is about 50 percent determined by genetics.

Speaker 3:          00:56:46       In other words, you inherit about half of your political opinion and the other half is acquired through experience, through exposure. So if you grew up in a liberal family, yeah, you're getting you probably you're, you're about 50 percent likely to wind up being a liberal because you absorb though that way of seeing the world. If I'm a Democrat, if I had. I grown up in a conservative family, I think I'd be a conservative. And I actually think having read this book, I think I'm actually a genetic conservative that adopted liberal values because of my environment. I think there's a lot of people who are genetic liberals who have adopted conservative values. I mean it. It's about 50 slash 50, but the point is, so it's Avi Tishman our political nature. That's the name of the book. I got it wrong. I just wanted to correct that, but the point of this to me is that, and he knows this, I mean scientists know this because when they look at identical twins that share almost all of their DNA, identical twins later in life are far more likely to have the same political opinion than fraternal twins, which don't share all their DNA.

Speaker 3:          00:57:52       You understand what I'm saying? Yeah, so that's how they know this. When they looked at identical twins, there's a much higher concordance of a political opinion later in life than for fraternal twins. That's how they know that it's around 50 percent of your political view is determined by genetics. If it's determined by genetics, that means it had survival value. That means that liberalism and conservatism both had survival value in our evolutionary past and is as a result, has become encoded in our DNA. Like other behaviors like generosity, other character traits like generosity, courage, things like that, those are all encoded in our DNA because they had survival value will likewise conservatism and liberalism, which means that in the argument, the discussion in this country about politics, you can disagree with people, go for it, democracy comes out of disagreement and compromise is great, but what you cannot do is point your finger across the aisle and say, not only are you wrong but you shouldn't exist, like go away, disappear.

Speaker 3:          00:58:50       You're not part of what America is. It's that assertion is completely contradictory to evolution and if and if it's contradicted your evolution, it won't work well. It seems to me that people have a really difficult time managing conflict, even managing verbal conflict, that when someone disagrees with them, they want to silence that person. They want to yell at that person, they want to scream and they they think about their own thoughts rather than putting themselves in the position of the other person or objectively recognizing that there is an important factor, they'd both. It's important to have both sides.

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       It's important to even be challenged on your ideas so you can solidify what's the root cause of your ideas. What is, where were they coming from? What, what, how, how much have you examined these ideas? Are you just married to them because they were given to you? Are these things you've adopted or are these really well considered thoughts that you've put through the mill?

Speaker 3:          00:59:46       Right. I mean, the thing is there were rules to contests, right? I mean, there are rules and MMA, right? There are rules and boxing. There were rules in marriages, right? I mean if you, you would never stay in a marriage where your spouse treated you the way the political parties treat each other right now. You would never stay. I mean, there's incredibly contemptuous, mocking, disparaging tone that both sides have. Like you, you were like, I'm Outta here. You know, my wife clearly just thinks I'm a complete dirt bag, or no one had talked. You know, you don't talk to someone like that that you have any respect for. Right? I'm Outta here. I think no one would stay in a marriage like that and what's happened, and this is new, right? This, I, we didn't grow up with this. Like this is a new thing where the political parties talk to each other.

Speaker 3:          01:00:31       I mean, disagreement is great, right? Come from, you know, we want eventually you compromise and you figure something out where nobody's happy, but that, you know, the machine goes on, right? The ship sails on. What's new now is this content and it toxic in marriage and it's toxic in a country too. And this is a new thing. And I think, and I think, um, if you really, if you really take in the reality that this truth, that half of our political opinions are genetically wired, you got to get rid of the contempt, you know, I mean, it's part of what we are as most people are aware of that. No, they're not right. That's what I'm talking about it. I mean, you know, um, and Congress plays on this, right? It's a great campaign strategy to like say things that are hateful things about the other side and consolidate your base.

Speaker 3:          01:01:16       And if you consult in both sides, do this right, and if you consolidate your base, then you're more likely to win the election you have, you're in a more solid political position so they can. And we know behavior, behavioral psychologists will tell you that one way to, to, um, make a group cohere, make it a closed ranks and strengthened its group commitment to itself. One way to do that is to introduce an enemy, and when there's no enemy groups naturally disperse because people just go off to do their individual thing. Of course, you know, you have the freedom to do that. There's no threat anywhere. Introduce a threat, boom, everyone's in a group. So what politicians do is they, they, they create a threat where there is none. You know, they say that other political party, they're actually trying to destroy democracy. They're not part of the democracy.

Speaker 3:          01:02:04       They're actually trying to destroy it. They're trying to destroy this country. Um, the same thing happened at the beginning of the Spanish civil war. My father grew up in Spain and I studied this matter, civil war quite a lot. The democratic reforms that were, that were coming in the thirties, you know, just land things like, you know, the vote for women, you have a, you know, pretty normal things, but there were a threat to the power structure in Spain and the military and the, um, so far right in Spain, the fascist basically said that those democratic reforms where people who were trying to destroy Spain. So you create an enemy that consolidates your power and you go on to win the election. It's great campaign strategy. It's just terrible for the nation.

Speaker 2:          01:02:43       Yeah. This, lock her up, lock her up. When, when trump was running, that was the big thing, right? The enemy that yet this was the enemy that was Hillary Clinton. She represented the evil Democrats who had been stealing and robbing and

Speaker 3:          01:02:57       right. And I, you know, I listen, I totally understand being in disagreement with Democrats. Right? But it's a different matters say that they're actually antithetical. The Democrats are antithetical to free democratic ideals,

Speaker 2:          01:03:10       but just seems to meet to. There's not a good party right now that the Republicans are mass, that Democrats are a mess. You know, they both suck, so reform them, right? I mean, or creative work, isn't there also an issue with just having two sides, right? Having the Yankees versus the red sox every year in the world series. Well those two sides, I just

Speaker 3:          01:03:29       do represent the sort of, the genetic strains in our liberal and conservative. I mean, it's good. It's going to break down one way or another in that direction. Right. And so, I mean, it is sort of a binary. I mean our brains are sort of binary in that way. Um, I mean as humans surviving the wild, you have to defend your group and you need fairness within the group. The, the two things you have to do to survive and remain a group. Right? Right. And, and so those tasks have been sort of like subcontracted out to conservatives into liberals and it's been that way for a very long time and you can even see some of those same behaviors like insearch in chimpanzee society. Right? So this is very, very ancient behavior. So like it, and I think you have to grips with it doesn't mean that the two groups have to act so a bismal with each other.

Speaker 3:          01:04:16       And, and I really think that if you want to save the, if you want to sort of save this country morally, politically, nationally, maybe, um, you know, really what you need is a bipartisan committee in Congress that calls people out and calls them out for doing and saying things that undermine our sense of unity as a nation. So when Democrats say he's not my president, that undermines the understanding of what democracy is easier, president. Like he got voted in man. Like that's what happens in a democracy is the guy you didn't vote for ends up being your president. That's what a democracy is. So just deal with it, right? I hate that. I hate that I'm a democrat. I didn't vote for him. But I hate when people say that. And likewise, when Donald trump sit, when citizen trump was accusing Barack Obama. And I understand not liking Obama, I don't really care if you don't like them or don't like him, but when citizen trump accused Barack Obama of not being a citizen and gop didn't repudiate that, I mean, think about it.

Speaker 3:          01:05:23       Citizen trump was telling every veteran and soldier fighting overseas that their commander in chief was an imposter, was a fraud, was not an American citizen, and has usurped the White House, right? That's a terribly destructive thing to tell men and women in uniform or in a trench getting shot at, right? And the gop like the DNC with this stupid. He's not my president thing, that the DNC is not rejecting that idea. They let people say it, they don't denounce it, right? The gop never repudiated that stupid idea that trump came along with and for the good of the nation. They both had to write. And this isn't a free speech issue. Everyone has the right legal right to make a fool of themselves. Go for it. But that doesn't mean the two political parties have to stay silent in the face of things that are completely toxic to our democracy. And they really should have spoken out and I think some kind of bipartisan commission in Congress that would call out those are the worst outrageous and calling the political parties to denounce them that that would be enormously positive thing in this country. I agree with you,

Speaker 4:          01:06:26       but I think it would take a truly exceptional person to look at the other side's faults and, and not capitalize on it, you know, and, and especially even if it's a false thing like the Obama thing with, with trump or any, any number of things you could find in that regard. But it seems to me like this is like the perfect time. If there was ever going to be a time where a third party with some sort of centrist type party would come around, this would be the perfect time where people are so. And we also, I think people recognize that what we're seeing on the right and the left in regards to Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump is you're seeing people that are pretending to be this thing right? With Donald Trump. He's a lifelong Democrat. And then all of a sudden he's a Republican. He's talking about God and I mean, this is just like, it's a show, it's a little dog and pony show on the right. And on the left you've got this woman who was part of the Clinton Foundation. They were essentially, it was a pay to play scheme. They were making millions of dollars and hundreds of thousand dollars for bullshit speeches that they would give to the banks. And this is not some sort of a, a real liberal. This is not a that the ideas that you were embracing about liberal values. I

Speaker 3:          01:07:36       mean, no, I mean the two parties basically have become sort of cartels to keep themselves in power. Yes. That's a great way to pray. And, and um, and you know, he'll, hillary was absolutely part of that on the, on the, on the left and you know, it, uh, all of it's antithetical to the highest ideals of the framers of the constitution and the people that established this country. And in and I, I mean, I hear you about the centrist party. That would be great. But there's, you know, I mean, the way the power structure works, the way the cartels work is they got all, they have access to all the funds, right? All the money, right? Where you, where do you, where do you get the money for something like that. You need to build something from scratch and get to speed and in

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       time to win an election, that's very, very hard to do. But at the very least, I mean, a centrist party could fall prey to that kind of toxic rhetoric as well. I mean, but I feel like there should be norms where freedom of speech is an absolute. I mean, we get it, but that the parties don't. They have a moral obligation to denounce things that they know undermine than unity of this country. I don't mean people in disagreement with one another. I mean a basic level of respect for the other person's personhood, for their citizenship, for their right to participate in the democratic process. And when somebody accuses the president of not being a citizen of the US, they're basically saying, I don't respect the system. Uh, like I, I, I, I think the entire system is a lie and, and, and I don't even think Donald Trump thought it was true.

Speaker 1:          01:09:04       I think it was a tactic and that the gop never called that out is really shameful. You don't think he thought it was true that the Obama was actually born in Kenya because I think he did because I know that he's really good friends with Alex Jones and talks to him all the time. I think he believes a lot of very wacky conspiracy, you know, I think he starts out believing that, but I, by the end, I mean, does he, I mean, did he, did, he did it for seven years. So many people did believe it though. I know, but he. But the thing is he was doing something that worked. He's a pragmatist. One of the things I really like about him in a way, I mean I hate, I find him sort of a moral in the way that it gives me the chills, but he's also a pragmatist, right?

Speaker 1:          01:09:41       So I think he's completely capable of advocating a position that he doesn't believe in, but I don't think he needs to believe in. He's like, enough people believe in this, that this is working for me. What was the benefit for him even chasing that idea down? I mean, he wasn't running for president back then, do you think he was thinking? I think he's been on it. I think he was considering it for a long time. So he was doing it to sort of deteriorate to Democratic Party. Yeah. And Yeah. And to see, see if this immigration stuff also, man, I, I mean maybe he believes in that stuff, maybe he doesn't, but it doesn't, it doesn't matter what he figured out very astutely as he identified a democratic demographic that feels like the country's getting overrun by immigrants. Right. And you know, statistics don't bear that out, but people feel that way and people feel that way.

Speaker 1:          01:10:22       They vote that way and he figured that out. Right. And so, I mean, more power to it, right? Like, I mean I'm, I'm not questioning his. I mean it worked for him. Right. But the only thing that I would say is like, please don't say anything, that I'm undermines the nation's sense of unity. Right. You know, that's the crucial thing. That's the thing that's keeping us safe in the world is that we're a unified country. And when you disparage the courts, for example, you're splitting the country apart, then the intelligence agencies don't do it. Right. I think you're drilling holes in your own boat, man. Are you astonished that all that works, that he can do that, that he can disparage the intelligence communities, that he could disparage the courts and that no one calls him out. No one says this is fucking outrageous. This is stupid. Especially knowing all of his campaigns ties to Russia that are coming out

Speaker 3:          01:11:13       now. Even more so. Well, listen, I mean, I, some processes happening that will eventually catch up with him. Like, I mean I, I mean, I don't know how it's gonna turn out. Am I surprised? Yes, of course. I'm surprised. I'm also surprised that the Democrats that, you know, within my lifetime went from being a party that was deeply concerned with the poor, with the working poor, uh, with, with, with people working in factories. You know what I mean? Those are at least the highest ideals, right? In my lifetime they went to, they became a completely elitist organization. They didn't give a shit about those people. Right. So, like that surprises me too. Right? So along comes Bernie Sanders who, whatever, you know, whatever his issues, he's, he's least sincere, you know what I mean? At least you trust the guy like that guy speaking his mind.

Speaker 3:          01:12:02       And the thing about Donald Trump, he's speaking his mind like he's not trying to, he's not, doesn't have these awful poll tested opinions like Hillary did and Jeb did. And all those guys like, he's like, no, no, no. This is what I think. I don't care how people, you know, how people react on this is as Martin Luther said, here I stand for, I can do no other. You know, a lot of places that trump stands, I don't agree with, but I actually, I'm actually impressed by his ability to say something no matter what the repercussions. This is kind of cool. Well, it is definitely a first, you know, I mean he's, I mean at the debate when he was talking to Hillary Clinton and I forget what exactly what you said, you know, uh, and he said because you'd be in jail and the whole place went crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:12:40       Like who the fuck has ever done that? It doesn't central debate. It's amazing in a work that I, you know, like my house kind of off to. Although I disagree with him. I'm almost every political point that he says he holds. But I, but I got to say like, like it worked and he, I wrote an essay and I was talking about different kinds of courage and you know, this sort of physical courage, right? And, and I mean lives are literally being courageous in the face of harm to your body. And I feel like trump is, you know, he's a bit of a bully and I think that to me, bullies and cowards are sort of the same thing, right? They're just two different sides of the same character trait. And I said, but that's not all trump is. He's actually morally, he's actually very courageous.

Speaker 3:          01:13:20       Like he's not a moral coward. He will say exactly what he thinks, no matter what the opinion's going to be. He has extreme confidence in who he is or he doesn't give a shit, you know? I mean, that's moral courage. It like this is what I believe and I'm going to say it. I don't care if I don't win, I don't care if I go to jail, here I stand for, I can do no other Martin simply could have is elitist mentality because he does believe that he's above a lot of the repercussions for saying these things. But a lot of people who are elitists are cowards and this thing. And I disagree with trump on just about all of his policies, right? But the thing I do kind of have to tip my hat to his head. He's not a moral coward. He works. He will say thing that every political pundit in the world will say, no, that's going to get, that's going to destroy you. You're going to attack John Mccain and you're gonna hope to win the Republican nomination and you're fucking crazy. And he did it and it works. But he attacked him for being captured.

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       I know, which is insane. And I think trump truly feels that way and I don't agree with them. But I do respect the fact that he said it in the face of all political advice. He didn't give a shit. He said it because he believed it. That's moral courage. I just disagree with his opinions. But I that moral courage, very few people have it. He has it and I just, I wish he used it to unify the country and he's still splitting the country. And that thing has any desire to unify the country. Very self serving. I agree. And I, you know, I don't think hilary did either, you know, and none. You know what I mean, and that's the problem with our pool parties right now is that they're serving themselves before they serve the country. Well, I think it speaks to what you're talking about in your book that no one is looking at this like a real tribe and uh, an enormous tribe of 350 million people, but there's no one person that's standing out as a real leader and at least what Obama was, I mean, whether you agree with his policies and there's a lot that I don't agree with is particularly in where the way flip flopped about whistleblowers and freedom of the press, those things disturb me greatly because I know how intelligent he is.

Speaker 1:          01:15:18       I know he's a lawyer. He was a statesman though. I mean, he really came across as a guy who you go, oh, well that, that guy should be the fucking president. He sounds like the president. He's, he's, he has a fantastic vocabulary. He speaks clearly. He, he's a very, he's a highly honed human being. That's right. That's right. No, no, I agree. And I, you know, there are things I didn't like whatever that about him, but, but absolutely as a, as a person, I mean he brought a huge, I thought he brought a huge sort of gravitas and dignity to the office. Dignity. Yes, definitely without a doubt. He mean he was probably one of the best ever at that. But I think that what we need now, um, is someone who genuinely wants to help the country be unified. Someone who genuinely wants to help the country, not help their party, not, not help themselves, not just think, well, hey, when this is all done, I'm going to make a fucking million dollars a year doing speaking fees or whatever, however much they make when they do that.

Speaker 1:          01:16:20       Well, yeah, and you're going to, I mean we're, I mean we need that to stay to remain a country. Yeah, right. I mean like, I mean, it really is headed towards a bad place I think. And so that person is going to have to overcome the sort of reflexive reaction of the left wing. You know, he's not my president. And the reflexive reaction of the right wing, the right wing hated Obama in ways that were completely out of proportion to Obama's actual policies. And you know, what Mitch Mcconnell said, you know, the Republicans job in Congress, their foremost job is to make sure that Barack Obama is a complete failure as a president like it that's not serving the country, not at all. Right? So, so you need a leader who is actually able to overcome that toxic thinking

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       in both parties, right? Right. I mean, who is Jesus coming back like, I know who's going to do this, who is going to do this? But I think the start is a bipartisan commission that starts to call people out. Right? So you, you have Republicans calling Republicans out because they're on this commission. Do you have Democrats Calling Democrats out? You need it. You got the free speech to make a fool of yourself, go for it. But you're not going to undermine this country without being called out by this commission. And um, and I was talking with someone in government pretty high up about this and I said, you know, I had sent my thing, you'll bullets aren't going to destroy this country, okay, is never going to destroy this country, um, but our own words we'll can destroy our democracy like that actually could do it if we play this hand drawn.

Speaker 3:          01:17:57       And I said, that makes partisan rhetoric actually a matter of national security. And when you can think about as an think about it as a national security concern, then you actually have a sort of political and legal basis for forming a commission that addresses it. And I really truly think that should happen. And if it doesn't, hopefully something else will happen. That works. But it's the only thing I can think of that will begin to address that, that can, that can rise up above the partisan interest of both parties because those, the parties clearly don't seem capable of doing it on their own. Now when you write a book, like try, when you outline all these issues that people have and all these issues historically that people have had, do you try to consider a solution? I mean, do you, do you have a solution?

Speaker 3:          01:18:44       Are you just examining all the various problems that we have? So I mean tribe was me trying to make sense of sort of what ails us, starting with, you know, people hemorrhaging off the frontier to the American Indians and on up to the soldiers. I was with mass shootings, you know, something's, something's not working for us. Right? What? So it was foremost in analysis. Um, and towards the end, um, I talked a little bit about solutions and one of the solutions I talked about was making a concerted effort to get rid of contemptuous partisan rhetoric in government. And I really felt that that trickles down and pollutes, it pollutes the water stream down, like downstream. It pollutes everything so that everyone all as citizens are drinking toxic water. Um, from, from that rhetoric and wondering if the unity can survive, like will this will the center hold? Um, you know, you hear your parents screaming at each other in the bedroom and saying unforgivable things to each other as a child, you might rightly think, wow, this marriage isn't lasting in this family is not lasting. That's how it feels to be a citizen of the United States right now. Like mom and dad are screaming at each other. And so I talked about contempt, disagree. If you want, don't speak with contempt about someone you share a combat outpost width and that's what this country potentially as don't you think also

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       with the mom and dad analogy that it also shows you how to behave in your own life. And I think that's one of the things that's really important about the president is the president does sort of represent the best example of what we can be. When we were kids growing up, that was the thing, like he asked the kid what they want to be. If someone said, I want to be president, and were like, Holy Shit, you're really going for a kid. You want to be the biggest job. That's the number one position. So you're supposed to be the best person ever, which is why we hold someone to such an incredible microscope, which is almost even more impressive that trump won after that, grab the pussy audio recording and that he could just brush that off as locker room talk. It's right in a way.

Speaker 1:          01:20:47       He's kind of right. I mean, it really is kind of fucked up that they did try to use that on them and pull it out the last minute. But it does give you also an understanding of how he thinks and behaves when no one's around. Right? I mean, you know, my problem with him was that I like if I look at the worst of his behavior, um, I mean people sent society says people to jail for the worst thing that they did. So it is actually legitimate to judge people's worst behavior and evaluate them on that basis. So if I look at the wharf, look at the worst of his behavior, even if I was a diehard Republican who, who adhere to all of the things he says he believes it. If I looked at the worst of his behavior, a mocking a gold star family, like mocking a disabled person that wasn't real though, you know that mocking a disabled person was sort of trumped up.

Speaker 1:          01:21:36       He does hate to use that word trump cup. He does that when he's talking about anyone. Like when you asked flustered like, oh, what are you going to do here? Like that they tried to say that he was mocking a reporter that it was disabled, but it's pretty clear that that's not right. Well, I mean maybe so, but with a, with a question from someone who's visibly disabled, maybe you just don't do that. You know what I mean? Like each pattern it does. Well maybe, but maybe I'm giving him more of the benefit of the doubt that I should. But if it was the only example that I wouldn't be thinking about it, but there is a sort of pattern that, that, that model from Mexico who gained some weight that he was walking. I mean like the mockery of less powerful people is sort of endless.

Speaker 1:          01:22:18       And so to me, I wouldn't, I wouldn't have that person at my dinner table, you know what I mean? Like I just with my close friends, like someone who was acting like that, he started acting, started doing that and my dinner table, I'd walk around, I get up and walk around the table, put them in a headlock, I think drag him out of my house. Right, right. I don't want to think that about my president. I want my president to be someone I'd be like glad to have at my dinner table. I would, would've. I didn't vote for George Bush by love to have that guy. I had dinner table, Ronald Reagan. Did you know what I mean? Like he's the first president and be like, no man, I don't want to subject my bi friends too that you ever read rudy errol woody Harrelson's account of a dinner that he had with trump. He said literally had to get up in the middle and go outside and smoke a joint just to just

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       relax himself. Yeah. I was talking about, I think you said early 2000. He had a dinner with trump. And he said he never met someone so narcissistic, so self obsessed.

Speaker 3:          01:23:15       Yeah. And you know, the, you know, my worry like in this conversation is that it will somehow seem partisan and like I will be saying the same things if trump were a democrat,

Speaker 2:          01:23:25       something about George Bush that you'd be happy to have him over. And I just think, I hope that what comes out of this is that a hero will rise and that someone will. Someone who's really legitimately good person will say, look, this is a, this is a fucking travis day. Like someone who actually could assume the role correctly will step into place. And it was see that very clearly in comparison. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:23:48       Well what I mean, do you get back to your question? One of the solutions that I talk about it, it's not in my book, I talk about this. This is national compulsory national service with a, with a military option. And in the your question was how do we make this nation feel like a nation? Right. And the problem psychologist will tell you that the more you sacrifice for something, the more you value it. And if you're part of something that doesn't require any sacrifice at all, you just don't value it very highly. Right. The advantage of national service it, and I don't mean the draft, I think I don't mean military service. I mean national service with a military option. I don't think it's moral to force someone to fight a war that they don't believe it. But what sort of service which, you know, whatever, whatever it is, the nation needs a lot of stuff done right.

Speaker 3:          01:24:33       And whatever that may be. But the point of it is, so if you had a military option, but otherwise you could teach in schools otherwise you could dig ditches. I don't whatever the nation needs done this work, this core of workers at 22, 23 years old does it for a year. My first wife was from, from the eastern, from eastern Europe and the young people formed work brigades in the summer and help harvest like harvest wheat and stuff like that was what she did when she was a teenage girl. And it was incredibly good for the kids over there and it made them feel like they're part of something. Right. And so what I would say, there's a downside to national service, which is the government's telling people what to do. Of course there's also an upside, which is it makes everyone feel like they're part of this thing called the United States and it puts white people and black people enrich and poured.

Speaker 3:          01:25:25       Everyone, puts them all in one big pot and stirs them up just like the military does. And they get to know each other. And so everything's is an upside and a downside to everything. Right? So national service has a very obvious downside, but the upside isn't discussed much, which is that it creates an American identity, a shared experience that all Americans have that like in Israel is compulsory service and that that is a common ground that every single Israeli has, whatever, wherever they fall in the political spectrum, they all have that shared experience and it's an enormously potent thing in that country. Keeping it bound together. And this country I

Speaker 1:          01:26:03       think needs something like that. I think it would be very, very helpful. Well, it'd be nice if people did have some. I mean if you, if you use some sort of connection to what it takes to keep things running, whether it's help fix the streets, whether it's, you know, help do something. But the problem that I would have it probably I would have with it is the idea that someone from the government would be able to require you to do something and that if you didn't do it, they could treat you the same way the irs treats you. If you don't pay your taxes, I just lock you in a cage, which is. Well, I mean one made, one way to do it might be to incentivize it by sort of making it mandatory, incentivizing it by giving people really large tax breaks for doing it.

Speaker 1:          01:26:45       Yeah, but young people aren't going to think about tax breaks. They're going to think about, fuck that man, I want to skateboard or I don't want to go, all right. Then they have to listen to me. Listen, for most of this nation's history, we've had a draft as the government telling people what to do. Right? And likewise with taxes, you don't pay your taxes, you go to jail. Like I mean the government does, the government puts red lights and intersections and you have to fucking stop. I agree. But to try to do that today, it'd be extremely difficult. The distrust of the government is so high and if the government comes along and says, you have to do all these things and then we go, wait a minute, are you doing these things? Are you going to join the military? You're 55 years old, your senator, are you going to go pick wheat or fucking fix the roads?

Speaker 1:          01:27:24       It definitely has to start. I mean, yeah, you can't. You're not going to get 60 year olds and in national service, right? They're already involved their lives. The great thing about 18, 19, 20 year olds, 22 year olds, is that their lives haven't really started yet. I mean that's why it works in Israel. Yeah. So are people gonna object you? Of course they are, but the question is how do we unify this country that the truth is like if we wanted to unify communities, you'd been in the car, right? People can, you know they are living there spending their whole lives within walking distance of their home that will, that will unify communities. We're just not willing to do that. What will unify the country's national service? We may not be willing to do it, but that's a different conversation from would it work or not?

Speaker 1:          01:28:05       My opinion is, is that it would help. It's a good opinion. I mean, I, I definitely see merit in it. I definitely think that would be something that would be a fascinating debate to have back and forth. I just wonder if people at any point in their lives today who would be willing to give up freedom for the government. I think people are used to this kind of like free ride. I pay my taxes and that's all you got from me. I don't have to vote. I don't have to do anything. You know, in Australia you have to vote and if you don't vote you get fined. Well that, you know, that's what you said it right there. That's the misconception. It's not for the government, it's for your neighbor, it's for your fellow citizens. Everything you pay your taxes, not for the government. You pay your taxes for the country, but you pay him to the Gulf, to the government.

Speaker 1:          01:28:47       There's no auditing of your taxes. And I think that's one of the things that freaks people out today. Like you don't know where that money is going. They don't have to tell you and if you don't give it to them, they'll lock you up. Right. And that's the problem with a large scale society is that collective effort. It's not clear that that collective effort is going to the whole entity. It looks like it's going to the tax man. Right? It's not. I mean that's an illusion, right. But I mean the check is to the irs, the irs handed over to the government that that's then spends it on the country. I mean, that's the reality, but it looks like the irs is oppressing you. Yeah, but that's actually not what's happening, right? The irs is an arm of government that you elected in. Right. And it's been charged with getting, getting money from people like that's just the irs isn't doing anything.

Speaker 1:          01:29:32       It was just like, it's like Tsa ever. I was standing in line at Tsa and someone was complaining about how long it was taking and, and, and the guy next to her, they didn't even know each other and the guy next to her who said, look, they're not doing it for them. They're doing it for us. Brian. They're searching all our stuff. They don't care. Right. They're not on the damn plane. They're searching our stuff for us. Likewise with the government, the government isn't doing it for itself is still new for us. Right. We like to think of it as one entity, right. We like to think of the irs as the government, you know, they are collecting the money. We almost think of it as them spending the money as well. We don't think of it. It was distributing it to the rest of the government.

Speaker 1:          01:30:12       That's right. Yeah, that's right. So if you want to gin up as sort of like antigovernment screed, like it's easy to play on that misperception because it's an easy misperception to, to have, I mean you get a $200 parking ticket in New York and he definitely feels like the parking bureau is like, is, is vengeful, is, you know what I mean, has targeted you personally as you're going to take your $200 and spend it on itself. That's what it feels like. The truth is that that $200 paves the fills in the potholes that you're going to be driving across next year. That's the truth of it, right? You know what we're talking about solutions for the woes of society in the end, particularly the individual. You have sort of found your own solution in journalism and, and embedded journalism in these very dangerous environments that this is how you have sort of reinforced your tribe.

Speaker 1:          01:31:00       And you talk about that in the book about how, you know, uh, how well you slept in this very tight confines in these bases with all these, like very loud snoring men. But the fact that you guys were all together in this very hostile environment, but that was your solution. Well, I mean, there wasn't a solution in this instance. I mean, it wasn't a longterm solution, but it did give me these experience of sort of, um, sort of shared a shared fate, right? I mean, it's sort of collective effort, right? I was part of this group, um, and my, my, my welfare was tied to the welfare of the group. My actions could help or hinder the group. I was judged by how I behaved in the group. Right. And that's, that's our evolutionary past. And it felt great. Right. And, um, so the, you know, the trick is we, you know, we live in a dispersed, modern society where that's just not going to be the 20 hour a day reality

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       for most people throughout their lives. But it may not need to be, you may just need a little bit of it, you know, maybe you get a little bit of that sort of collective, the collective norm at the boxing gym, you know, maybe you get it in the military, you know, maybe you get it hunting, you know, whatever, like there are ways to experience it and maybe you just don't, you maybe you get it a church in a. I mean, I'm not religious, but I, I, I understand church to be a profoundly communal activity and so I'm not saying burn down that suburbs and bend the car, although that would work pretty well. Um, maybe for your own personal sense of meaning and fulfillment in life. Find, find that collective experience in little bits and pieces and the little goes a long way. Yeah. And doing something and doing something difficult.

Speaker 3:          01:32:50       I think it's also very important. Absolutely. I mean getting together, shoot pool with your buddies every Thursday night. That's great. But it's not quite. We're talking about difficult things and things that test you physically and mentally for some reason there. Those seem to be a requirement for people and when people don't, don't fulfill that requirement. It seems to me those are the people that are most unhappy. Yeah, I mean the state there have to be stakes involved. Yes. There are no stakes to pool to golf right there. Pleasure gambling. Right. Right. But that, but that's not a collective, you know what I mean? That's not a collective state and um, they're pleasant activities, but what, you know, what, what reproduces our evolutionary past as being in a small group where the stakes are for the stakes are serious, if not life and death, but even, even if it's not life and death, at least they're real physical consequences.

Speaker 3:          01:33:41       And that collective action makes you more, makes the group more able to navigate those adversities successfully. And when you do that, um, it is, it's an intoxicating feeling is what we're wired for. It's what we're missing in our sort of modern lives. And you, you don't need, you don't need a huge amount of it to feel better. Another thing that seems to make people feel very fulfilled as creating things, working with their hands, creating anything, whether it's furniture, art, just making something, doing something where your mind is involved in natural task of bringing forth something into existence that didn't exist before. What we'll think about it. I mean, again, in terms of evolution, if doing something successfully produces a chemical reaction that feels good, a little bit of dopamine or in terms of communal connection, a little bit of Oxytocin, the, the, the trained monkey that we are, we'll continue doing that.

Speaker 3:          01:34:40       Good thing. So, so basically the tasks that helped with survival get rewarded with neurochemicals that feel good. Yeah. And the things that are dangerous to us, uh, and, and less than our chance for survival don't feel good. So being isolated, being alienated from your group, being an outcast feels bad and your survival chances go down, right? You don't want to stay in that place. You want to join the group again. And so there's these neurochemical reward incentives and punishments that get heard. People towards behaviors that help survival build, doing things, accomplishing things, building things that all feels good. It's clearly what we needed to do in our evolutionary past and is reinforced and creativity factors onto that. How that like say like art, like painting or something like that. Like there's something deeply satisfying to people that are painters. Well, uh, yeah, and what they're. I mean art, um, they know from the, from the incredible paintings on the caves and in the caves in France and Spain, Lesko and the other caves that art is one of the things that's used to bind communities together in ceremonies.

Speaker 3:          01:35:54       I mean, you can see you in church. I mean, there is no, there is no church in the land that doesn't have art on the walls, right? Um, the depictions of Christ or whatever or what are the visual aids that helps bind people into a group like, oh, we all believe in the same thing, right? So art is a great binding force. Music is an incredible binding force. So rhythmic like rhythm and heavy drumming rhythm. We'll get a whole group of people sort of moving in unison. And I'm, Jonathan Haidt has talked about, he talked about that sort of hive behavior and how it works and very, very powerful. So what I would say, and I'm just guessing here, but I would say is that the arch that are so intoxicating to be engaged in their survival value is that it makes the group cohere around a unified idea.

Speaker 3:          01:36:39       And that music does that. I'm the visual arts do that. Um, the spoken word poetry song, all those do that as well. And so the, you have a group of people that are there are unified on these all, all these different levels. So what happens when the enemy comes, I mean the music starts the sort of like visual pageantry starts like you get, you know, like the, you know, the war time posters showing heroic soldiers with rifle and bayonet or you get the, the war art, right? You get the martial music, all of that galvanizes the public spirit to face the enemy and it works extremely well. Wow. So you think that that's one of the reasons why art is so satisfying. I mean, I just assume that our evolution has produced that anything that feels good to us had survival value in our past, so of creating art feels good. That's because we are genetically predisposed towards doing things that bind the group together. Generosity feels good, right? If you walk down the street and you give someone $5, you just a random dude, you just give them five bucks and you measure the. The neurochemicals in his brain and your brain, you get more of a high than he does. Right? So generosity feels good. It's clearly adaptive and helps groups go here, right? Yeah. And Art as well,

Speaker 1:          01:37:55       so that art, when you create something amazing, what you're realizing is that someone's going to see that and go, wow, that's incredible. Like they're going to get a great feeling off of seeing your art. Yeah. You have the same vision, oh, I painted that tree and this other person or that antelope or that bison or whatever you find in the walls of the and this other person comes to like, oh my God, that's an incredible bison. There's no, like you did something the other person connected to now you the two of you are joined in your understanding of what that painting means. Right. And that's a very powerful thing. So if you drew that bison and no one else in the world ever saw it, I'm guessing that the chemical rewards for that creativity would be let will be lower. Yeah. I, you know, I noticed that in my children, my kids love to draw and one of the things that they love is showing their drawings.

Speaker 1:          01:38:44       I mean they love to draw but like not yet. Not yet, not yet. And then when they're done like look, try and I'm just like boom. They did getting that little rush themselves and you get the rush and I mean look, I mean just do it. It's easy to test like taking musician, measure their neurochemicals while they're practicing in a room by themselves and then put them in a, in a, in a stadium filled with 10,000 people and see what happens. Well, I'm guessing that the guy in the stadium with the Bruce Springsteen in front of 10,000 people is experiencing a neurochemical reality that he's not getting in his living room. Not only that'll probably a neurochemical reality that very few human beings will ever experience. That's right. Some sort of a strange. But think about the power of that. I mean, you know, any musician on stage is basically acting sort of in the role of the Shaman, right?

Speaker 1:          01:39:32       To like, I'm going to act. I'm going to act as a conduit between you all and the divine right and my music is going to do it. My words, you're going to do it by dances going to whatever it is, but I'm the conduit, right? I don't matter. I'm connecting you with a, with a divine feeling and that feeling is going to unify all of you and I'm going to play these chords. I'm going to sing this song and like magic. You are going to be tapping your feet in unison. Like how do you get 10,000 people do the same thing at the same time. You sing them a song is the only way to do it. That's an incredibly powerful thing and that's the uh, I mean that's the power of the Shaman. I mean bruce springsteen isn't a shaman literally, but he occupies that space in a modern, secular, secular society doesn't have shebeens but, but in the old days, that's what he would be.

Speaker 1:          01:40:17       Do you feel that way when you put a book out? Like when you put the book out, when you know it's done, you read it, it's done and he sent it out there and do what kind of weird feeling that you get. Are People going to read that? It's an interesting thing about a book because you actually never observe in real time people's reaction to it. I mean, I'm not perched in someone's arm chair watching them read in bed. You know what I mean? Like the general public about like reviews. Yeah, but that's also very. It's very distant. But when I started making documentaries for the first time, I had the experience or the experiencing of watching other people's experience when I'd done

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       right. I'm not watching the audience, I'm in the audience and I'm watching people react to ristreppo. Yes. I never got to see people react to the books I read because I'm not in there damn bedroom. Right? Right. But I am in the movie theater. I'm watching people react to the things that the films I made. And I wouldn't say it's apples. Oranges under know, which is one better was what, you know, whatever. But it's a very different experience in. It's incredibly powerful. Which do you like one better? I mean, movies just can't. They don't have enough bits of information. I mean a book. You can really communicate information, right? Very sophisticated ideas and they're permanent, right there. They are in the person's bookshelf and the person could underline that paragraph and go back to it. You know, you've actually affected sort of communal thinking. You've affected the way people understand the world of film is an experience more than it is a sort of data dump and um, or a philosophical argument.

Speaker 3:          01:41:52       And that experience is very, very powerful. It acts on a different part of the brain than a book does. It's much more emotional. Um, I mean, I've, you know, I've, I've choked up, I've teared up watching my own films because they're personal to me, you know, I've never done that reading my own book, rereading a book that I've written, so it's a different experience and I would never say this is different parts of the human mind like you need, you certainly need boats. So no long answer. I don't have a preference. I feel like I, I need both now. This documentary on Syria, um, when is this available? Well, it, we may, it's called Hell on earth. Um, our website is hell on earth.com. It's, um, how'd you get that? It seems like that would have already been taken, right? The different websites that are available.

Speaker 3:          01:42:38       And that's true. That's true. I thought about that. I didn't, I wasn't in charge of getting it by the wizard. Right. I'm going to have to pay for that one. So it was called Hell on earth. It's about the Syrian civil war. Um, we made it for National Geographic. I made it with Nick quested, my partner and all the films that I've made. Um, and it, it brought it broadcast last June. It's gonna, you know, nat Geo rebroadcasts, everything that they do, obviously you can also go to their website and stream it. It's about this treatment today. Yeah, absolutely. It's about the Syrian civil war, how it started. Um, and particularly how isis, why isis arose up out of that. And we all know what Isis is. This is grotesquely violent radical jihadist movement. Um, and, and that, um, we have all seen, seen their video, heard of their videos where they're beheading people and you know, in front of a video camera and a ghastly, ghastly things.

Speaker 3:          01:43:28       He said, why did that, why did that happen in Syria? How did that, that mutation occur at this point in history in that place. And so the, the, the film examines that. And um, were you there? Did you go to Syria? No, you know, after my friend Tim Hetherington was killed, uh, Tim, obviously I made restrepo with an, he was a brother and a good friend and a colleague and he was killed in Libya in 2011, uh, on an assignment that I was supposed to be on with him at the last minute. I couldn't go and he got killed. And so I stopped war reporting after that front line reporting. Syria was so dangerous that you couldn't think of going in there. I mean, in numerous kidnappings and beheadings, um, it was basically a suicide by the time we started working on the story. It was a suicide mission.

Speaker 3:          01:44:12       So we actually worked with Syrians in Syria who are documenting their own war. Wow. I'm a including an incredible family that was living under a, in territory under isis control and surviving. They were trying to figure out like, do we try to escape or not? And of course if you try to escape and you're caught, you're dead. They will drag your family out of a pickup truck in line. You open a wall, a machine gun you. But they were worried that if they stayed, they also die and they decided to escape. We got a camera to them at a very nondescript little cell phone camera and they self documented life under isis and the decision to leave and the um, their flight through the isis checkpoints through the front lines all the way to Turkey and they self documented and it's part of, it's the sort of through line in the movie.

Speaker 3:          01:44:59       Absolutely extraordinary family. Wow. And so then they're in Turkey, now you're in Turkey. Then they tried to get to Greece on a rubber raft on a Zodiac. They returned again. This is also documented by them. It's in the film. They returned back at the last moment by the, by the Turkish coast guard sent back and now they're increasing their actually doing really well. They started a small business. They're incredibly hard working, resourceful, beautiful people. I mean, they're, you know, like I wish they could come to this country. We'd be lucky to have them and they'd be lucky to have us. There are an incredible family and if you see the film, you'll see what I'm talking about.

Speaker 4:          01:45:30       That's a, that's a big point that a lot of people felt was missed at all the criticisms of immigrants coming over to this country, you know, the stock closed the border, stop allowing Muslims stop allowing all these people to come over from these dangerous areas that somehow know that these people would be agents of these dangerous areas coming to destroy our democracy. But these people are trapped. A lot of these people are, are people that are experiencing these horrible conditions, much like many of the people that originally made it to America and the.

Speaker 3:          01:45:58       Yeah. I mean, our country is immigrants. This country is. My father is a two time or refugee, right? I mean, he fled Spain during the civil war. I mean, he's passed away. He was born in Nineteen, 29, 19, 23. He fled Spain during the civil war. Then he fled France because of the Nazis rolled in. He came to this country. He was a brilliant physicist and we were lucky to have him and he was eternally lucky to be part of this country as well. Um, so what was odd about trump's try not to get political again, but I got to say what was odd about trump's travel ban did. There were countries that we'd never been attacked by. No one from those countries had ever attacked this country. Like, I don't want to go. Like what are those countries doing on the travel ban? This lunatic that killed people in New York. It was Becca. Stan like that wasn't on the travel ban. Like the, I mean, I understand trying to create a filter that keeps bad people out. Of course, every country does that just didn't understand this specific logic of those countries on the list. That made no sense to me.

Speaker 2:          01:46:53       No. It made no sense to anybody. And it's also, you're assuming that everybody in these areas is bad, including the people that try and escape that sounds. That sounds insane. And that sounds. It's just, it's cruel and anti human to not want people to have a chance. I'm not saying don't vet these people out. Don't interview them and communicate with them and find out what their backgrounds are. As much information as you can get you, of course you are you concerned because this is something that has been bothering me. I was concerned about my own reaction to yesterday's mass shooting that I was almost nonchalant about it. I was like, well, there's another one like that. We're getting numb

Speaker 3:          01:47:33       to mass shooting. You know, I ask myself two questions and it didn't mean to ask them and I'm just being honest and telling people this. I asked myself, I wonder if it was a white church or a black church. And I asked myself, I wonder if the attacker wasn't Islamic radical and a foreigner or was he a homegrown American? I assumed it was a. He obviously. Yeah. Um, and I don't even know what that says, what those questions say about me or about the country. But it's really interesting. Those are the first things I asked and I didn't like. I didn't like that. Those questions came to my mind so quickly. There was something about it that didn't feel good and they're very obvious questions to ask. I mean, you know, it's clear that those are very important things to know. But I didn't like that it came to me so quickly. Yeah, I am.

Speaker 2:          01:48:18       It's the exact same questions, but I also felt like it's just, these are patterns. They're inescapable patterns, whether it's the Vegas massacre or this one or the Orlando shootings. It's always a man and a. is it a Muslim or is it a crazy white guy?

Speaker 3:          01:48:34       Well, you know, in tribe I write about mass shootings are a very particular thing. I mean there's gang shootings in Chicago or whatever that may have a kind of logic to them. Right? Like you're controlling turf. There's money involved. Drugs would. Yeah, it makes sense. So, so you, a bunch of innocent people get shot. That's the price you pay for gang wars. There's a logic to it. There is mass shootings are completely nihilistic, right? It's someone killing as many people that he doesn't know right as possible before he dies. It's totally nihilistic. And what I found, and I did a lot of research into it, that, that those kinds of mass shootings typically happen in middle class communities like otherwise safe middle class communities or small low crime Christian communities, they have never happened in the inner city even literally never happened. Um, they, they happen in communities that are otherwise very safe, very Christian, very, very, um, boring frankly.

Speaker 3:          01:49:34       Um, and it really made me wonder like, is there, I mean, lots of countries have as many guns as we do. Every country has crazy people in it, in them, right? We are the only that does this to ourselves. And we do it only in a certain kind of community, right? We're doesn't happen in high crime, low income communities, right? It happens in the most sort of like small, quiet, Christian, low crime, bland, suburban or rural communities. That's where it happens. Uh, what does it say? Why is it that these communities are not producing crazy people? But somehow those people come to a place where they think this is a good thing to do. Like, why is that happening? My theory is that the deep alienation of the suburbs of sort of small town America, the law, the lack of real community effort, um, and the lack of national unity and the Pa, I mean the, the mass killings have risen abruptly in the last 15 years and I, you know, it's hard for me, it's, you don't murder people in your own community when that happens. It means the community doesn't exist, at least for the murderer. And

Speaker 2:          01:50:50       do you see any connection or do you consider any connection between psych drugs?

Speaker 3:          01:50:55       I mean, I don't know how many of these people are on psych drug

Speaker 2:          01:50:57       a tremendous amount. Like there was a study that, uh, that see if you could find it, Jamie. They connected all the mass shootings that have happened over the last two decades with all the different medications that people are on and every single one of them was on something or was withdrawing from.

Speaker 3:          01:51:16       Okay. So there's, here's the question, where are the drugs creating the behavior or the drugs? Treating a mental disorder that is self is tied to the behavior. Very good question, right? I mean there's, there's no way to know mass shootings of the nihilistic sort that I'm referring to started abrupt abruptly rose in the eighties. Okay. Um, and then doubled since 2006 and I think they're increasing even more since that. So

Speaker 2:          01:51:46       mass shooting over the last 20 years has one thing in common and isn't guns. Yeah. This is

Speaker 3:          01:51:52       right. But that's not, that's not just positive. Right. You know what I mean? Like it's, you're right. It's not. Correlation doesn't mean it couldn't be dishing. It could be the depression is rising in alienated communities and the depression is getting treated, unsuccessfully treated with drugs. All these people were on drugs. But really what's happening is that, and this is true suicide, depression, ptsd, anxiety, alienation, all of these things are going up in society and that's just statistically

Speaker 2:          01:52:19       unquestionably. The question that I would have about this though is that when I've talked to psyche, a psychiatrist about it, they say that the dissociative aspect of the psychiatric medications that are part of the problems that people do not feel, they don't feel the connection even to their actions, that they can do something horrific like shoot people and they might be even doing that to try to get some feeling.

Speaker 3:          01:52:42       Listen, that's totally possible. I would also offer this idea

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       that the massive national addiction to violent video games is a dissociated experience. You're shooting people, they're not real people. That doesn't happen. You know? I mean, I'm just are connected somehow. I don't know, but I'm just saying what you just described happening in the streets of America is exactly duplicated digitally in video games. Right? But the video games doesn't. It doesn't keep you from feeling things in the real world where the psych medications do. Right, but did the experience of shooting at human targets that aren't real. Right? If you incorporate that into how you feel about shooting and then you go out into the real world, it may not be that hard to particularly with the age of eight of psych drugs, drugs and whatever. Depression is sort of endemic in this society right now. It might not be hard to. To transpose that dissociated experience in a video game with digital images transpose it onto actual humans in the real world if you're sufficiently disturbed.

Speaker 1:          01:53:41       That's a very good connection and an interesting question because I haven't heard it a discussed when they're talking about war and how kids that grow up playing call of duty and things along those lines, they get really good at. It would be actually better in combat. They would have the tactics mapped out in their mind better. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, look, there's a TV program called active shooter, right? Like and they go back. I've just heard about it. I haven't seen it. I would never watch it, but it's, it's they go back and recreate. They re interview everyone who's survived active shooting incident and recreate it and now people watch for. I mean, in some sense, entertainment, right? TV is entertainment. They watch for entertainment, recreations of acting, shooting incidents that are, I think partly the result of the kind of deep alienation that happens in a, an immediate obsessed society that we're, no one's talking to each other.

Speaker 1:          01:54:30       You know what I mean? It's a perfect circle, right? Like, well, they're definitely escalating, right? I mean we had the event in New York where the guy runs over all those people and then a couple of days later or having the one in taxes. So this is, this is happening over the scale of one of the year, one every few years. We're getting a once a week. Well, yeah, and what's interesting, I mean in New York there was an ideology behind it, so it wasn't nihilistic. I mean it felt nihilistic to us, but to that guy, he actually believed in what he was doing, but the real mass shooters that they're just out there to kill as many people as possible. It's hard to know what the ideology is. Well, this guy was dishonorably discharged from the military for something. I forget what it was. So he was in a position, what's up?

Speaker 1:          01:55:11       It was a abuse on his spouse and child. Right. And he didn't have a license to own a gun, but you know, he owns whatever guns did he had. He got them illegally in Colorado where he drove to Colorado. That's what I heard. He got, it was in Texas. I think he got them into Colorado. Did he get them at a gun show or something like that? I don't know where I go, but yeah, I mean we're looking at little tiny details. The real question is how the fuck does a person do something like that? I mean shot babies, you know what I mean? Shot five-year-olds and

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       the whole thing is just. It doesn't even make sense. And I don't know if he was on a psych medication or if they know he was, but you know, just the staggering numbers of broken individuals that are committing these crimes. It's just very, very confusing. And you think that it's tied to what was what you were saying too, about communities about inner cities where you have impoverished high crime areas, but they're not seeing these things. Do you think because in these high crime communities are dealing with much more life and death and the struggles much more real, that they feel more connected?

Speaker 3:          01:56:19       I. This is totally a theory. I mean I have no idea. It's just the truth is that those awful sort of school shootings and mass shootings in the streets have never happened in a high crime, high crime neighborhood, and so one has to wonder what is it? It's possible that for all their very real stresses and traumas of poverty, that for all of those things, there is also more face to face communal connection in poor neighborhoods than in wealthy neighborhoods or in middle class neighborhoods and that, that communal connection. I mean literally meeting people in the landing of your apartment building, right? Meaning people in the door, stoop on the street, you know, with that, those kinds of human interactions even at even in a, in an economically stressed neighborhood, that those create enough of a sense of community that people who might otherwise go crazy and turn their guns in this nihilistic weigh on people, on innocent people that they just don't do it.

Speaker 3:          01:57:19       Because why would I do that to my own people? That's the and what I fear in this country is that we're losing the sense of what our own people are, what are our own people and if you're doing that in the streets of the neighboring town, like, you know, clearly there's been some loss of like some idea of what, what we belong to and that's where, you know, national service or a congressional commission that really calls out rhetoric that that undermines our sense of who we are as a nation. Like you know, it might start at the top changing. That might start at the top. It might help. Do you think there's any

Speaker 4:          01:57:52       incentive that the, these people experience to be someone who creates this big event where everybody has to

Speaker 3:          01:58:01       get them? I mean, I, I don't, I mean I'm guessing, but I'm a, I'm imagining that someone like that feels powerless and insignificant and abused by society and at least there'll be famous in their last acts and their death. They're going to cause a lot of reaction. They're going to. They're like, oh you, you messed with me my whole life. At least for the last five minutes about my life. You guys are the ones that are going to be scared. You're going to be begging me for mercy. No, I begged you for mercy my whole life. Now you're going to be begging me for mercy. I mean, I'm totally guessing, right? I'm just riffing here, but I, I wouldn't be surprised if there was something of that to it.

Speaker 2:          01:58:40       It's a good gas. I mean this has been a very common conversation lately as to whether or not you discussed these people and even bring up their names. I know in some places and some even media outlets, they don't want to report on the person. Individual is creating this chaos.

Speaker 3:          01:58:58       Well, you know, one of the things I think is a problem is that if you love this country, there is a certain pressure to think it's the best possible country ever. Right? Yeah. And I think it's very painful for Americans to actually look at the actual statistics and say, you know, for example, with mass shootings, we were the only country that does this to ourselves. The only one. There's not another country that has not at the rate that we do in China. They were, you know, there's a rash of knife attacks. Right. I mean, I'm just not that it doesn't happen at all, but if you really look over the last 20 years is more than that. Since the eighties when this shit started. Like we're the only country that does this regularly to ourselves. It regularly to the point where it's like every month practically. Right, right.

Speaker 3:          01:59:44       So it's, it's a sign. I mean, if your child was acting out in a violent way and punching kids in the playground, you think, okay, he's in pain. Right? He's acting out like, what's wrong with this kid? Like he's clearly in pain and some kind of pain and he's lashing out. Well the society is in some kind of pain, like, what is it you know, and you, you know, you can just miss me as a bleeding heart liberal, you know, whatever. I don't mean you. But one could dismiss me as a bleeding heart liberal. Like, okay, well then what's your, what's your question? That my question is what, what, why are we in so much pain? Right. That's the question that I think might begin to lead to an answer of why there's such high suicide rates in such a wealthy society. Why there's mass killing, you know, that would begin to answer those questions. If you don't like that question. What's your question? To answer those terrible tragedies. What's your question? Well, what you're saying is very compelling.

Speaker 2:          02:00:36       Uh, and it's, it's an aspect of this that I don't think is being considered. And I think your book is very important when it comes to that. I think the questions that you raise and the, all the, the various examples that you give there, it's really food for thought and I don't think it's being discussed in very many other circles. It's everyone's looking at the psychiatric drugs. Everyone's looking at the white men with guns and the gun problem, the NRA and all these various aspects. They're not looking at the root cause of this depression, anxiety and this detachment that we have from our neighbors and our community.

Speaker 3:          02:01:11       Look, I mean Somalia has got a lot more guns than we do, right? And there's plenty of violence in Somalia, but no one's walking down the streets of their own neighborhood, massacring their own people. Only we do that. And what is, you know, in a, in a sense, it's a call to a cry for help by our society, like, uh, not by that person. I'm saying generally the phenomenon within our society is I kind of cry for help. Like we are. Something is wrong psychically, spiritually wrong. Christians will say we're not a Christian enough country, but, uh, you know, like, that's, that's, that's, uh, that's not true. That's not the problem right there. There are um, peaceful Muslim societies and very violent Christian woods and you can correlate it with Christianity. Um, I think the one thing you can, there are democracy. There were their oppressive societies are very low violence and their full democracies like us, we lots of violence. So it's not the democratic system, right? Like what is it in my guests and it's only a guest. My guest is that a certain amount of the high suicide rates, high depression, anxiety, drug addiction, porn addiction, child abuse, mass shootings and shootings in the streets. My guess is that the common denominator in all those things is the true catastrophic lack of communal connection that many Americans experience. Well, it's,

Speaker 2:          02:02:28       it's a very compelling argument. It's a very compelling point that again, I don't see being discussed in very many other areas and I really appreciate it, man. I really appreciate your book. I think it's great and, uh, I really suggest anybody's interested in the subject. Please go read it. Tribe Sebastian younger. Thank you brother. Appreciate it man. I really enjoyed it. Thank you very much. Anytime. Come by. Alright, thanks everybody.

Speaker 5:          02:02:52       Awesome.
