Speaker 1:          00:00:00       No, three, two, one. I always wonder what you base your countdown on, Jamie. You got two things going. Why is it an accurate count on or use roughly guessing like a five count because we have a. does it delay the thing and then the thing and that thing and. Okay, well we're live. Chris, what's up to to be here. Thanks for doing this man. My pleasure. We were just talking about the term Paleo, like I put up a that we're gonna talk about nutrition and diet and all that good stuff and then somebody went to your page and it says, you know, Paleo and lifestyle expert. As soon as you have that word Paleo, people go, oh, fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:00:42       Serious baggage. That's true. I mean, every day I think about, Oh, I kinda wish I never would have used this word.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       Yeah. Well let's Mark Sisson went with primal. Yeah. He's. He uses that primal blueprint. Yeah. You know, that's his sort of distinction of it.

Speaker 2:          00:01:01       I like that. I mean they're both just words is what it really comes down to A. I thought about, I wrote a book that has the word Paleo in it, and I thought about even before I published a book, I was thinking, you know, what I'm talking about is not really what people mean when they say Paleo. It's a lot more inclusive and a lot less dogmatic and if I use this word, there's going to be pros and cons. The pro is people recognize it. It's, it's one word that that points at a whole way of thinking. I could have called it the new nutrient dense ancestral, you know, nutrition book, but that's not too catchy and like five people that read it. Um, and, but on the other hand, Paleo has a ton of baggage, as you said. You know, it, it, it. People get a certain idea when they hear that word. And for some it's good. For others it's kind of neutral. They don't know anything about it. And then for still others it's like instant turn off and you know, why should we be emulating our Paleo ancestors lifestyles. They all died when they were 30. This is stupid, you know, why should we do this? So it's a totally loaded term, I think we just need to get past it as, as a, you know, an idea or a term and look at what it's really pointing at it and evaluated on that basis.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       Yeah, I think that makes a lot sense. And also there was the issue with the term Paleolithic, like using the term Paleo and then there were some articles written about the actual diet of the Paleolithic people where they ate everything they got a hold of and if they got grains they eat a ton of grains. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:02:34       absolutely. So, I mean we know they weren't eating cheese doodles and drinking big Gulps, right? So it's kind of easier to talk about Paleo in terms of what it didn't include. So it didn't include processed and refined, you know, Brad flower cookies, muffins, uh, all kinds of packaged foods that comprise a large percentage of the American diet. I think that top six foods now, our grain based desserts, sugar sweetened beverages, pizza. I'm chicken dishes, which are primarily fried chicken nuggets. I'm forgetting the other two, but it's all crap. You know, the foods wasn't the prime or six primary foods. America Americans is just completely nutrient depleted junk, you know, so we can all agree that our Paleolithic ancestors weren't eating those foods and then we know it's pretty clear that they were eating a lot of neat. Well, I'm sure we'll talk about that. Meat and fish, wild fruits and vegetables, not the domesticated varieties that we're eating today, but wild fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds and some starchy plants.

Speaker 2:          00:03:42       So, so, so those are the two extremes. If we bracketed and then things like grains and the GMS were more of a question mark, like there's some recent evidence that shows that that lagoon consumption was probably pretty more common than we thought amongst our Paleo ancestors. They were, they came later onto the scene, but if they were there, they probably ate them. Is that based on geography? Like we're lagoons are present. Exactly. And what other food sources were available. It's pretty clear that they weren't the first option. You know, if they were able to slaughter an animal, they would have done that and, and eating the organs and the brain. And probably throw in the muscle meat to the dogs. Really? Yeah. Yeah. We have it backwards. I mean, when you look at traditional hunter gatherers and the way they eat animals, they go just like wild animals do.

Speaker 2:          00:04:29       When wild animal kills another animal, it goes straight for the organs. And that's because the organs are way more nutrient dense than the muscle needs. Um, and so traditional peoples, they knew the same thing even without having access to science and you know, knowing even what a nutrient was, they just over generations figured out that eating liver and the kidneys and the spleen and the brain was, was going to give them more energy, make them feel better, make them more fertile than eating the muscle meats. But did they eat the muscle meats at all? I mean, it seems to me that they probably did because they hungry. They use every part of the animal, but it was clear that the organs were where the, the, the, the favorite thing to eat. And how do we know this? I'm just start anthropological studies of hunter gathers a contemporary hunter gatherers, you know, in the sixties, seventies, eighties, there aren't many extent hunter gatherer groups that we can even study now because they've, you know, they've all been basically assimilated.

Speaker 2:          00:05:29       Um, but you know, like the Hudson Hunter gatherers in Africa and there are some groups that are still living a lifestyle that's relatively close to what they were living for the last 10,000 years. And we can learn a lot by studying those groups. And that's a pretty common theme in all of these traditional peoples as they. They focused on eating the organ meats, you know, second would be probably meet another animal products in terms of nutrient density. They ate a much broader variety of plant species and we eat like, you know, across the world. Most people eat, you know, four to eight plant species in their diet. A traditional hunter gatherer groups. It was over 100. Wow. They were just whatever was edible, huge diversity of plants. And that of course increase the nutrient density, increase the fiber that they were eating, which we now know feeds of beneficial gut bacteria.

Speaker 2:          00:06:19       Which has all kinds of uh, benefits for health and, and again, they weren't eating the foods that we are now, you know, uh, eating way more than we're eating anything else. And when I say we, I mean just Americans or people living in the industrialized world in general and that's, that's a problem because of this concept of a species appropriate diet and we know that all organisms evolve, evolve in a certain environment and they're are adapted to survive in that environment and when their diet or lifestyle it gets too far from what they evolved for, this mismatch occurs. And that mismatch is really responsible for all modern disease.

Speaker 1:          00:07:04       Yeah. That is something that I thought was really interesting, but reading some of your work and some of your articles that you had sort of narrowed down to I believe eight. The eight different factors that contribute to a, to ill health that are a lot of times ignored when diseases are, when, when someone gets, when someone gets diagnosed with an illness, almost immediately there's a drug prescribed to treat the illness, but there's not like sort of, um, backing up of the process to find out. Okay, how did you get to this position? Like what is your diet like? Are you getting enough sleep? What kind of stress are you under? Is your body. I'm exposed to toxins on a regular basis like you do you work with paint, you know what I mean? Are you, are you near something that's really bad for you to breathe?

Speaker 2:          00:07:56       Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the analogy I like to use is you have a rock in your shoe and it's making your foot hurt. You could take advil, right? And it's gonna. You'll probably feel less pain, but you could also just take your shoe off and dump out that rock. That would be a better idea. Right? I think we can all agree on that. And our Ma, our medical system is the equivalent of taking advil when you have that rock in your shoe, if you have high blood pressure, you go to the doctor, you'll get a medication to lower it. If you have high cholesterol, you'll be prescribed to staten and those can be effective at bringing those numbers down. But there's rarely any investigation into what's causing that symptom in the first place. And you know, the problem with that is take the high blood pressure medication, it lowers your blood pressure, but then you have no libido.

Speaker 2:          00:08:45       And so what's the solution there? Another drug that increases your libido, you get via Viagara, but then Viagra, you know, causes of some other side effect. And then you get prescribed another drug to deal with that side effect. And then by the time you're 65 or 70, you're taking seven or eight medications. And the statistics actually bear this out. You know, most people at that age are taking two handfuls of pills just to, you know, to, uh, to be able to get by. And that's really not the way that human beings evolved, evolved and are designed for.

Speaker 1:          00:09:21       It's also it becomes a problem because there's a lot of money being made on selling those things. Absolutely. And the pharmaceutical industry is this gigantic monster of a business where they're just making billions and billions of dollars and there's so much momentum when you have a big industry

Speaker 2:          00:09:40       that absolutely. And they realized a while back that the big money in drugs is not in treating sick people. It's in treating healthy people because they are way more healthy people than there are sick people. And so once you get done with making drugs to treat diseases, you need to start making drugs to give to people who are fundamentally healthy but maybe have like some one lab marker that's out of range. So take stat and drugs for example. You know, there's only a certain number of people that have already had heart attacks and are in danger, you know, high risk of having another heart attack. So you first stat and drug sales to grow. They need to expand beyond that population and start prescribing them to people who aren't necessarily at high risk for heart disease, but um, you know, maybe have slightly high cholesterol and that's where the real money is made.

Speaker 1:          00:10:32       Wow. So, so people that don't have really health consequences of this, like, uh, like if you have high cholesterol, high cholesterol is a lot of times associated with diet. Yeah. But the reality of cholesterol and cholesterol rich diets and blood lipids is that it doesn't really move the needle. It's so much more complex than that. And what is the cause of like if a person has high cholesterol, what are the potential causes?

Speaker 2:          00:11:01       So diet is definitely one genetics or not, or just certain genetic polymorphisms that make you more susceptible to having high cholesterol. But there are a number of causes. They're lesser known. So poor thyroid function. It's one cause because thyroid hormones required to clear ldl cholesterol from the circulation. So if you have, you know, even suboptimal thyroid function, not frank, hi. You know, full on hypothyroidism, but just a little bit of have a problem with thyroid. Your cholesterol can be high, and in fact, back in the eighties or seventies before statens were a, became a bigger part of the, of the treatment of high cholesterol doctors east to use low dose of thyroid hormone to treat high cholesterol. So they knew this at one time, um, disrupted gut microbiome and leaky gut, which I know you've talked about on this show with other guests, a ldl is actually an antimicrobial substance.

Speaker 2:          00:11:58       So the liver will make more ldl particles if there's toxins, endotoxins getting into the bloodstream from the gut. Um, infections can raise cholesterol, ldl and toxins can do that too. So there's studies showing mercury toxicity, for example, can raise cholesterol. So these are all the potential underlying causes of high cholesterol. So if someone comes to see me and they have that problem, I'm going to test for all of those things. I'm going to address those first. And then we see what happens and if their liquids normalized after that, great. You know, we've done our work and we end the avoid taking a drug that they never needed to take in the first place. If we retest and they're still in, their levels are still high, then we have a bigger conversation about what the actual risk is given their level, their age, their sex, their family history, the absence or presence of other risk factors like high blood pressure and uh, inflammation, you know, so it's, it's, it's really complex.

Speaker 2:          00:13:03       And then this idea that there's just an arbitrary number for total cholesterol and if you're higher than that, you need to take a staton and if you're lower than that, you don't is, um, I don't, I can't think of a good comparison right now, but it's ridiculously over simplified and it also has some effect, um, or your, your, your eight year amount of exercise and your overall, uh, amount of, uh, uh, what you put your body through as far as like stress, exercise, activity that has some sort of an effect on it as well. Absolutely. Cholesterol is a repair substance too. So if there's any kind of damage, endothelial damage in the arteries and the lining of the arteries, cholesterol can be moved to that site to repair the damage. Um, lifestyle choices definitely play a role. So you know, we need, I think getting back to your, to the original point here, we need to be thinking more holistically about what causes disease and how to treat it instead of just using bandaid approaches that suppress symptoms.

Speaker 2:          00:14:10       I mean we don't really have healthcare. We have disease management not to toe. That's a fundamental difference that we need to understand. Like if you think of disease as a spectrum where you know the far end is death and here is perfect health. Very rarely do people go from perfect health to, you know, straight to death. I mean that happens in trauma accidents and things like that. But usually we progressed along that spectrum and our conventional medical system is designed to intervene at the far end of that spectrum. You know, when we're, we're already kind of past the point of no return. You know, we had these drugs that suppress symptoms. We have pretty amazing trauma care. Like if I get hit by a bus, I don't want to go to the hospital, you know, we're, we're starting to be able to restore sight to the blind and do these incredible things. But they're all at that far end of the spectrum. A conventional medicine is really lousy at preventing disease in the first place or treating it at, at this end of the spectrum when it's closer to health and it's really bad at promoting health. In fact, in most medical school textbooks, there's not even a definition of health. It's just basically the absence of disease. But I think we can do better than that.

Speaker 1:          00:15:21       Yeah. It just seems logical. I mean, it seems that, that, that should be an approach that everyone should consider when you're looking at the broad spectrum of illnesses and diseases and injuries and all those different factors that are involved in making someone ill that this is what you're saying seems so common sense, but it's not common at all.

Speaker 2:          00:15:42       Not Common at all. Um, it does seem common sense to me and I think part of the problem. I mean, you hinted at it before with big Pharma, it's like there's little incentive for big Pharma, big Pharma to promote this kind of approach. Why, why, you know, what's their interest in doing that? I mean, it means less sales for them. They're there for profit corporations that are publicly owned and it's in their best interests of the shareholders to do things that grow the company and grow the business. Right? That's just how it is. That's how, that's how our system is. And you know, that's, that's a whole nother discussion. But um, it, it's problematic when it comes to healthcare because you know, the way it really should work is if you go into your doctor and you have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, your doctor sits down, says, asked you a whole bunch of questions about what you're eating, how you living, are you sleeping, are you exercising, you taking care of yourself, you managing your stress?

Speaker 2:          00:16:41       And then they do a whole bunch of testing. They don't just test your blood pressure, they don't just test your cholesterol, they test your gut, they test your, your hpa axis, which is what governs your whole stress response. They list HPA, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. So it's this, the brain, basically the connection between the brains and the brain and the adrenal glands, and it governs our stress response. So there are ways that we can test it to see how you're being affected by stress. So if you're under a lot of stress that's causing hormonal changes in your body, it can affect every aspect of your how we can test for this. So they would do a lot of testing upfront, which would be more expensive initially, but down the line it would save thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient. So let's take someone with type full fledge type two diabetes, depending on the estimate that I've seen, it can cost anywhere from 60 to 80,000 to $400,000 to care for that patient over the, their lifetime to the insurance company.

Speaker 2:          00:17:42       Because insurance is paying for a lot of these procedures. They develop, let's say retinopathy later. They go blind. They, you know, they, they require multiple operations and surgeries. They're taking expensive drugs. All of this stuff adds up. But let's say we could have spent $1,500 right off the bat when before they even develop type two diabetes to identify what was happening and you know, catch it before it happened and intervene. Then yeah, you spend a little bit more upfront, but you ended up saving tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars over the lifetime of the patient, so I think eventually the insurance companies are going to realize this because there are also for profit businesses and they're interested ultimately in things that can save money. They just don't yet see functional medicine, which is what we're talking about right here as something that could potentially save them a lot of money. They see it as something that they have to spend money on because the testing is more expensive upfront, but they're not looking at the longterm game.

Speaker 1:          00:18:45       I wonder if pharmaceutical companies are just going to buy up the insurance companies and use it like as a write off. A cynical person may have that thought. I mean I would, if I was a pharmaceutical company, I saw the writing on the wall like, hey, people are having way more access to information about health than ever before. They're going to start to make these healthy choices and we're kind of fuck guys, listen. What we're going to do is we've got to get in there early. Stranger things have happened. There's a lot of problems with this in terms of like doctors, when you, uh, you're a doctor, you have a line of patients waiting to get into your office and you have standard model of treatment that you've been sort of practicing for a long time. So to deviate from this path and to say, hey, you know, this whole rock in the shoe analogy that you brought up, which is brilliant, it's a perfect way to describe it. This all makes sense and it's logical and everything like that. But, uh, you know, hey, insurance is not going to cover all these different tests. We have a giant issue also in getting people to be proactive to actually do something. How many people do we know? I know a bunch that are fat, that talk about being fat, that have poor diets that drink too much and eat too much sugar and constantly eating crap and not exercising. They're 100 percent intellectually aware of this and they don't do a goddamn thing about it.

Speaker 2:          00:20:08       Yeah, you're right. It's a systemic problem, so if we break it down, you know, on the, on the doctor care providers side and the inpatient side, so the care provider's side, I mean they're as much victims as, as we are. It's as, as patients are to um, to this whole system that's been set up because as you pointed out, like the way the system works, most doctors who were working in an Hmo type of setting have like seven to 10 minutes to spend with a patient that's so crazy. That's not enough time to have the kind of conversation that you need to have even even to get beyond saying hello and writing a prescription, a prescription, which is basically what happens in of those encounters. And then you also mentioned that the standard of care, so they're legally required to, to, to take certain actions and certain circumstances and they, their medical license and their whole career could be at risk if they don't do that.

Speaker 2:          00:21:00       So even if they question, for example, prescribing statens to a patient who has a total cholesterol of 2:40 but no other risk factors. If they don't do that, then they could actually lose their job. And so, so it's, it's not, I'm not being critical of individual doctors here. I'm criticizing the whole system that we've created that, that I know many doctors, I trained doctors and I know many doctors and I can say that most of them are aware that the way that we're doing things is not working and they want to change it as much as anybody else, but they feel constrained by the system. And then the other problem is, you know, us as individuals, like the level of responsibility for our own health that we take. And I think, you know, this, we were, we all ultimately are responsible. So, so let, let me just say that, but it's also true that we're influenced by the system that we are part of.

Speaker 2:          00:21:57       And so, uh, you know, you, you get this whole culture which is basically oriented around disease management and suppressing symptoms with drugs. And that's what patients come to expect. And so I've heard from many doctors and there've actually been studies on this so that patients will go in to the doctor and they'll, they'll request a drug and they won't be satisfied unless they leave with a prescription for that drug, whether it's indicated for them or not. And this is because we're one of only two countries in the world that has direct to consumer drug advertising, the US and New Zealand and only two countries in the whole world that allow ads in magazines that are targeted towards consumers for drugs and the risk in doing this is exactly what we're talking about now. You get someone who's seen a drug ad in a magazine. They're like, I need that drug. They go into the doctor, they ask for it. The doctor knows it's not right for them, but the patient's not going to be satisfied unless they get that prescription. So the doctor caves and gives them that prescription.

Speaker 1:          00:22:59       I did not know we were one of two countries in the whole world. I thought new New Zealand was a little more on the ball. It's surprising in a way that New Zealand, you're a stupid as we are, but yeah, that's. That's a giant problem. The did that advertising model. Well, advertising is a giant problem period for people because we're so susceptible to influence

Speaker 2:          00:23:20       and they've shown this with food in particular that you know this the advert, the big, there's big Pharma and there's big food and big food. Capital B, capital F is this whole industrial food production system that is invested in selling us crap and they are well aware of how, you know, they study how to do this, so they have food scientists on staff that study the palatability and reward value of food. This is like technical stuff like how foods stimulates the, the reward centers in our brain and that, that pringles add hope, bet you can't just eat one. They will win that bet because they have, you know, scientists on staff that have engineered that food to make sure that you do eat more than just one because they, they, they study things like mouth feel and all of the different things that go into stimulating the reward centers in our brain to make us eat more than we should.

Speaker 2:          00:24:22       And so we are being manipulated and you know, we have a responsibility to see that and to get beyond it. I'm not saying it's not a cop out, you know, people aren't responsible for their actions, but it's, you know, there's more to it. We're, we're, we're in this environment where we're being consistently manipulated every day. It is very sneaky. The pringles things in particular. Absolutely. I mean, there, Ryan pulled that out there. I think about like if you had a plate and there's a, you have a baked potato with no salt or butter on one plate and then you've got another plate and it's potato. It's pringles. What do you think you're going to eat more of? I mean it's just, these are hardwired evolutionary mechanisms. We, we're, we're, we're hardwired to seek out novelty variety because it would ensure in an, in a preindustrial food environment that kind of hard wiring would actually be a selective advantage, meaning it would help us survive in a Paleolithic type of environment because we would seek out foods that had a variety of flavors, usually different flavors means different kinds of nutrients.

Speaker 2:          00:25:26       So we would, uh, someone who had that kind of programming would be more likely to survive. But when you take that evolutionary programming that was designed when we are living in a, you know, in a payload Olympic type of environment, and you transfer that into this modern environment that we live in where you've got the 7:11 on every corner with Doritos and big Gulps and candy and all this stuff. It's a total unmitigated disaster. Well, that environment, that environment of like a seven slash 11 when you go in there and there's just zero healthy choices and all of it is sugar drinks and these fucked up snacks that have no nutrients. And I'm like, yeah, that it's, it's such a bizarre common place that you can just pull into any one of those things. There's so many of them and they're just overwhelmed with unhealthy choices all over the world to now and you know, we've exported our crap to all of these other countries in the world and, and pretty much any country.

Speaker 2:          00:26:27       I mean, I, in my twenties, I traveled all over the world surfing and I was shocked at, you know, I'd, I'd be in this really remote place in Indonesia and I'd see like a coca cola barge going, going by from island to island in this little archipelago where there was nothing, you know, just huts on every assignment, but then you come up to this little hut and there'd be like a thing of coca cola bottles, you know, crazy. And we've managed to export this everywhere and it's just, you know, people, uh, it's hard to go against evolutionary programming because this, it's real and it's until unconscious. It's, it's below the, the cognitive center of our brain where we can rationally think about it. I mean, you mentioned before people who are overweight but don't make healthy choices, that's not because they don't intellectually understand that they need to make healthy choices. It's that they're fighting against this deeply hardwired programming that is totally incompatible with the modern food environment that we have and you know, for whatever reason, some people are more successful at getting past that than others.

Speaker 1:          00:27:39       Yeah. About being able to attach intellectually detached from the instincts where you, you know, for a fact that all these things are definitely bad for you. Even though there's a compelling desire to take them in, they have this ability to step back.

Speaker 2:          00:27:51       Yeah. It's, that's, that's sort of a learn thing. It's a learn thing, you know? It's not a natural thing. I mean, if you it, what's more natural is to see something that you crave and to eat and to eat it or drink it. I mean not that is a natural animal human experience. What's less natural is to see that, feel it, and then have a thought that says, no, this is actually not going to be good for me. And so I'm going to make a different choice. I mean, not. That's a, that's a. and I don't think it's the same. I don't think we even experienced those cravings in the same way. Like there are. Um, I mean, for example, if someone has a really screwed up gut and they've got a lot of bad bacteria or they have some fun, they have fungal overgrowth or something going on in there, those bacteria we now know and yeast can produce chemicals that actually affect our brain chemistry so that someone who's got a disrupted gut microbiome might experience those cravings way more strongly than I do. And so it's harder for them to intervene and stop that because it's almost like they have a, an alien presence in, in their body that is creating these foods. And it's really hard to overcome that.

Speaker 1:          00:29:06       I'm glad you brought that up because that was one of the things I was going to bring up next. Um, the idea that your gut biome actually controls your cravings and controls your, your desires for things and also when you cure that up or when you heal it and you start taking in healthy probiotics, your desires for different foods sort of emerge for me over the last few years, like say three years plus I've really gotten into probiotics, got really heavily into drinking Kombucha on a daily basis. And then I started eating a lot of Chee and a lot of fermented cabbage and then it became Kiefer and a lot of other different things. And now I take on it total gut health package with every food that I eat every time I eat something. And I think that like really concentrating on probiotics has boosted my immune system.

Speaker 1:          00:30:00       I'm very rarely sick if I'm sick, even though I travel so much. If I'm sick, it's for very short amount of time. Right. And then I snapped back pretty quickly and my desire for sugary foods is almost nonexistent unless I'm drunk or I just want to indulge. But like I used to have this massive desire all the time to eat like a sandwich or eat a bowl of pasta or, and now I look at it and if it's not even really food like it, my mind has sort of reached a tipping point. And then also my, my gut biome, I believe. I mean I'm just guessing has changed where like if someone is a piece of cake laying around, I don't look at that piece of cake and go, God, I got to stuff that in my face. I look at it and go, that is a lot of problems. That's a lot of sugar. That's a lot of not good for you. I'm going to, it's going to give me some mouth pleasure and then I'm going to feel fucking terrible our

Speaker 2:          00:30:54       right. Yeah. No, I think that's all true. All supported by the research. There's a lot of research now on the gut brain access which recognizes the bi directional connection between the gut and the brain. So in other words, how the health of our gut and our gut microbiome directly influences brain chemistry. Likewise, our brain chemistry, I directly influences our gut so it can work in both directions. So if you're under severe stress, for example, I think most people recognize the phrases, butterflies in my stomach before you go onstage and perform, that you feel that, you know, I don't know if you experienced that now since he performed so much. Do you still, do you still get the. Something's really important. Like I'm going to do a

Speaker 1:          00:31:38       yeah, comedy special that I'm gonna fail or something like that and I get like a little nervous most of the time you just, it's a heightened sense of like, okay, here we go right now. But when you were about to do something that's scary,

Speaker 2:          00:31:50       your pants right. There's another less for fine example of the gut brain connection. So it's been in our lexicon for a long time. So I think like on a popular basis, most people are like, Duh. Yeah, I know my brain's connected, my gut. But it's only been in the last 20, 30 years that the research has really come around to, you know, clarifying what those relationships are. So, um, we know that changes in the gut microbiome can affect our brain chemistry and in fact, the, the, uh, the prevailing theory now of what actually causes depression is called the inflammatory cytokine model of depression. And so it's not the thing that, where your serotonin levels are different than you know, and, and that's why you're depressed. It's that you have inflammation primarily in the gut and inflammatory cytokines travel from your gut through the bloodstream, up into your brain, across the blood brain barrier.

Speaker 2:          00:32:45       And they suppress the activity in the frontal cortex which basically causes the symptoms of depression. So there's, there's, this is totally mainstream, not fringe science, where they recognize that depression may be caused and anxiety may be caused by inflammation in the gut. So this is where the direction of science has been heading up. And then, you know, it stands to reason that if you take probiotics, you eat fermented foods, you eat fermentable fibers that grow, help feed the beneficial bacteria that are already in your gut. You can influence that bank brain chemistry. And so not only change your mood, you know, potentially heal depression and anxiety. And then even, you know, cognitive behavioral disorders, Adhd and things like that, but you could also profoundly changed the creating of food that you have because if pathogenic bacteria feed on sugar, so you may not just be dealing with your own cravings when you're craving sugar, you're dealing with the cravings of those pathogenic bacteria.

Speaker 2:          00:33:48       We know there are examples in nature of bacteria and microorganisms changing the behavior of their host in order to propagate their own survival. So, uh, I'm, I'm probably gonna Butcher, I don't remember the exact species, but, um, it's a parasite that gets into a particular insect and aquatic wildlife. There's that. And there's one, a land one that causes it to crawl up to the top of a blade of grass where it can then be eaten by the ultimate host that, that parasite wants to get into. Yeah. And I'm not remembering the exact species, but there's a biologist know that microorganisms can, can change our, our behavior. And, and we like to think that we're not animals, but we're subject to these same influences. Oh, 100 percent. I mean, it is a very bizarre distinction that we want to think we're people, we're not animals, we're special. We, if we've evolved beyond being animal

Speaker 1:          00:34:43       switch, it's cute. It's nice to think, and it's nice to separate ourselves because we're conscious and we're aware of our actions and, and that, those are all absolutely correct, but we're just a heightened state of animal life. Absolutely. End of the day. We're subject to the same influences, right?

Speaker 2:          00:34:58       I think so, and I think it causes a lot of harm to see ourselves as separate.

Speaker 1:          00:35:02       I think you're right. The term leaky gut, what does that mean? When people hear leaky gut, they've heard it a bunch of times. Um, it's, it's something that gets talked about a lot when people deal with in quote unquote gut health and probiotics, like what does, what is leaky gut mean?

Speaker 2:          00:35:20       So this is a, this is an interesting example of how, of what happens in research over time. So you know, 20 or 30 years ago if you went, if you were like a medical conference and you use the term leaky gut, you would have been laughed out of the room, you know, it was really the province of alternative medicine providers and quacks. And yet today, if you go search on pub med, you know, the major clearinghouse of, of medical studies, you can find thousands and thousands of articles on leaky gut. It will be actually talked about with the term intestinal permeability. And so what, what this means is a, it, if you, it's kind of interesting think about this, but your intestine is bake is basically a, uh, it's a, it's a hollow tube that goes from your mouth to your anus and anything inside the intestine is technically outside of the body. Really. It's weird to think of that way, but if you have a tube that's going all the way through your body and anything that's inside that tube is not actually inside your body. Whoa. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:36:29       So the, the tubes job is to decide what gets inside of the body and what stays out because anything that doesn't get absorbed just gets eliminated as waste without ever getting into your body. And we couldn't survive if we didn't have this ability to discern friend from foe. It's supposed to let nutrients that we need in, but keep toxins and other wastes out. Right? So that's the, the, the, one of the fundamental purposes of the gut barriers to it, it's other guide is to be a barrier. Basically diarrhea when you're not well, exactly. Clear that stuff out. Let's go everybody, everybody, everybody out right away. So, um, the, the, the guide is primarily a barrier. It's a barrier system and when, when that's working well it opens and closes appropriately. And so, you know, oh, nutrient, okay, open, let that in talks and waste closed.

Speaker 2:          00:37:21       Don't let that in. Uh, and, and so everyone's gut is permeable in an appropriate way, right? When it's working well, because if it wasn't permeable, it wouldn't be, we would die, we wouldn't be able to absorb nutrients. Um, but the other side of that spectrum is if it stops being permeable at the right times and starts letting things in that shouldn't be in there in the first place. That's what's called leaky gut. You know, you basically have an inability to to keep out stuff that's not supposed to get into your body. And then like so some of some examples would be large protein molecules. Typically we digest protein into small peptides that our immune system doesn't recognize it as foreign invaders and is able to use to grow muscle and do all the things that protein helps us to do. But if large protein molecules that have not been properly digested, sneak into the bloodstream, our body rec sees those things as foreign presence and creates antibodies to attack them.

Speaker 2:          00:38:26       And that's why we develop food allergies or food intolerances. Another thing that gets through the gut that shouldn't is called endotoxins. So these are toxins produced by a certain species of bacteria. Things like lipopolysaccharide and they can get through the gut barrier and then our body produces antibodies to them and attacks them as if they're foreign invaders, which they are in that case, they shouldn't be in there in the first place. And all of this basically creates a systemic inflammatory response. So, um, you know, whether it's food antigens that are getting in there that shouldn't be, or whether it's back bacterial endotoxins that are getting in there, that shouldn't be leaky gut leads to this chronic low grade infection, inflammation and basically all modern diseases that kill us like diabetes, heart disease, uh, even some of the ones we've already talked about, depression doesn't necessarily kill us, but all of the mental and behavioral diseases, autoimmune disease, which now in fact one in four women and one in six men, just crazy. And given that they don't really exist in traditional hunter gatherer societies, all of these are inflammatory conditions. So, uh, something that contributes to inflammation is going to significantly increase our risk of acquiring one of these diseases. And then eventually dying from one of them. Now when we say inflammation, that's another term that people here really,

Speaker 1:          00:39:50       but I don't think they necessarily understand. It's along the lines of

Speaker 2:          00:39:54       it. So like you did an awesome job clearing the thing for me too. It's solidified, but inflammation.

Speaker 1:          00:40:02       Why is inflammation caused by sugars? Why's it caused by simple sugars and corn syrup and things on those lines. Too much simple carbohydrates, like what is, what is causing that?

Speaker 2:          00:40:14       So there's this great paper published a few years ago by a professor from New Zealand, actually Ian Spread, Barry, I think is his name. Um, forgive me if I'm not getting that right in, but he, a distinguished between two different types of carbohydrates, a cellular and cellular, a cellular meaning lacking cell membrane and a cellular carbs are carbs that have been heavily processed where their natural cells that would be found in a plant, in a whole plant, like a start, like a sweet potato or a potato or something like that have been broken down in the processing. So you have white flour for example. Um, you know, originally came from a whole wheat plant that had its cells intact, but then it's been the seed or the kernel of the whole wheat has been removed and you just have the starch with no cell cells anymore. And what that means is, um, with, with cellular carbohydrates, our body has to really work to break those down and the actual glucose, the carbohydrate itself is relatively inaccessible because we have to work so hard to digest it and get at it.

Speaker 2:          00:41:24       If you think of an analogy like a nut, you know, like a whole walnut, it, you know, you have to do a lot to get to that. So it's gonna be hard to overeat those, um, in a, in a kind of a traditional setting because there's so much work involved at getting at it. Whereas if you have a bag of walnuts from trader Joe's that have already been shelled and, and, and they're just sitting there salted, you can just pound a whole bunch of those. So with this, a cellular carbohydrate, it's basically the equivalent of removing the shells from the nuts and just making those carbohydrates super accessible. Not only to us but to the bacteria in our gut, and so his argument was that when we eat a lot of processed and refined sugars that are, that are highly accessible to to to us and also to our gut bacteria, we basically create an imbalance in the gut where you have a proliferation of bad pathogenic bacteria that thrive on sugar and a reduction of good bacteria that we need to be healthy and not imbalanced. Then creates an inflammatory gut microbiota and as I described before that those inflammatory cytokines that are produced in the gut, they can travel out from the gut and affect the whole body systemically. So you know, 25 years, 100 years ago, hippocrates said, all disease begins in the gut and he didn't know, you know, any. He didn't have any of this modern science that we have now that shows that this is true, but he, it turns out that he, he was right.

Speaker 1:          00:42:56       That's fascinating that people have these ancients sayings like, follow your heart. And then we found out like fairly recently, within the last few decades at the heart is filled with neurons. Right? And that there might actually be some sort of memory or thinking, you know, quote unquote going on in your heart

Speaker 2:          00:43:15       and then having a sense of purpose is associated with greater longevity and better health, which is also following your heart.

Speaker 1:          00:43:22       Very strange sort of sentiments that turned out to be like, you think of them as just sort of old tales or old things that people say old expressions, but they turn out to actually have some basis in fact, almost instinctually

Speaker 2:          00:43:37       I think we're, we're kind of recovering lost knowledge at this point in a lot of ways and, but we're recovering it in different way. Like we're, we're using modern scientific tools to validate or clarify ancient wisdom that's been around for a long time and I think they both have a place. And, and I personally think it's fascinating to learn what the mechanisms are that explained that, that wisdom in those sayings. But I think we can sometimes be too quick to dismiss that wisdom as being like, you know, silly or stupid or not nonscientific.

Speaker 1:          00:44:13       Yeah. I, I definitely think. Well, I think it's very important that we today in this day have the tools to use science to sort of explain unequivocably why these things are factors in why these things exist and that we've proven in these studies. These are peer reviewed. Here we go. Here's the studies. It showed that. Oh yeah, well there's neurons in the heart. Oh yeah. Well that makes sense. You think that way? Oh, there's biome. There's a, there's actually like organisms and I think the way you described as great that there's like an alien living inside you that wants sugar because it really kind of is that there's organisms in our body. I got, I, I heard it explained once. I never forgot it, that there's more eco lie living inside your gut than there have ever been people ever.

Speaker 2:          00:44:58       Right? Yeah. And there are more microorganisms in our gut than there are stars in the universe. I think some crazy stuff. So that's where I step in and say, how's that possible? It doesn't make any sense. The Universe is infinite. Right? Well, there is that. I mean, I think that was the, the early conception. They're not, they maybe haven't read about the multiverse theories. Yeah. Because someone

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       who's like enormous, like Ralphie May, he has more cells, right? So he is, he's a, he's a bigger universe. Like how does that work?

Speaker 2:          00:45:28       Well, what you said about science is really true and I mean I love science. I'm dead. I'm going, I spend most of my days in interacting with science in some way and I think it's worth pointing out that there is some real um, problems with the way science is conducted today and uh, I think we run the risk of, you know, of worshiping like the randomized clinical trial and at the expense of other kinds of knowledge that can be just as important or more important in, in certain ways.

Speaker 1:          00:45:59       Well, one of the things that you brought up that I think is very important is who is funding some of these trials on pharmaceutical drugs and the efficacy of them and how they profit off of it and how, how many studies are sort of thrown out that don't fit the narrative.

Speaker 2:          00:46:17       The file drawer phenomenon. Yeah. Explain that. Well, so two thirds of medical research is funded by big Pharma and that makes, yeah, two thirds. So, um, you know, this is just human nature. Upton Sinclair said it's difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on him not understanding it. It's one of my favorite quotes because it explains a lot, right? And, um, so you can look at it just in terms of basic human nature, like if you're a researcher, you're being funded by a pharmaceutical company, you know, you know, even if it's not conscious, there's a subconscious thing there where you know that if your results are negative and don't support that drug, you're less likely to get the next, your next project funded and you're a human being. You want to have a job, you want, you want your work to be funded.

Speaker 2:          00:47:13       I mean, that's, it's really easy to understand, right? It's not like these are bad people who are all like in conspiracy to, to, um, push drugs on us. I think most researchers are good, good people and trying to do the right thing. Um, but it's a way that the system set up, that's the problem where they need to depend on pharmaceutical companies for their funding and it's really hard, you know, don't bite the hand that feeds you. It's just, it's, it's a time, you know, the age old saying, and there's a lot to that. Um, up until recently, I think there've been some recent changes here, but, uh, researchers, we're not required. A pharmaceutical companies were not required to publish negative results. So if they did a drug trial and the results didn't support the drug, it turned out that placebo, it was more effective or you know, their drug had side effects that made it not, not usable.

Speaker 2:          00:48:08       They, those studies just basically go into file drawer that they wouldn't actually be published in a journal. And there's been a movement to change that to where, you know, if a study is conducted, it needs to be registered and then no matter what the results are, they need to be published so that people have a chance to see not just the positive results that support the drug trials. But the ones that didn't. It'd be nice if that was retroactive, right? Um, but then there are other problems like fraud and so, uh, there was a pretty big study published in Jama a little while back by Java is Journal of American Medical Association, you know, very prominent prestigious journal and it was a guy named Charles siefert and he basically looked at the FDA, a monitoring of drug trials. So the FDA's job, one of their jobs is to make sure that the trial is being done to, uh, determine whether a medication is effective or done the way they should be and that, you know, there's no falsification of patient data or, and that patients are being there, their health is being protected adequately and there's no fraud going on.

Speaker 2:          00:49:18       So what he found was that in a, in a shocking number of cases where there was fraud, where the FDA actually I did identify fraud and it was serious enough that they took action in 96 percent of cases, the action that they took was not reported in any scientific journal. So let me give you a few examples. Like in one case, a researcher changed patient data to hide the patient had preexisting kidney and liver problems and they gave this guy chemotherapy treatment and he died and then the researcher ended up spending six years in jail and that was never mentioned in the study that was based on that trial data lake that was later published. So that's one example. Another example I did they do that. What was the most note? There's no, uh, the motivation is to get the drug approved and why would they hide the fact that this guy, that the FDA doesn't require companies, pharmaceutical companies to publish that data and because they say in their language and according to, to see for it in this paper, it's more essentially more important to the FDA to protect the commercial interests of these companies than it is to protect public health.

Speaker 2:          00:50:33       Even though this is an agency that is ostensibly there to protect public health,

Speaker 3:          00:50:40       skype. So maybe I'm getting it wrong. He had preexisting liver disease,

Speaker 2:          00:50:45       liver and kidney issues and cancer and a researcher thought changed, falsified his data and covered up that he, that, that this was known when he was given this chemotherapy drug.

Speaker 3:          00:51:00       But why would they do that? I just don't understand why they would cover up the fact that it guy was already sick. Like, wouldn't you think that that would be the opposite?

Speaker 2:          00:51:09       Let me use another example because I think this will help show what's happening here. So there was a Chinese site, you know, most drug trials, they take place at different sites, so they have multiple locations that are testing so that they can get data on different populations, you know, not just in white Americans, also Chinese people. And so they do it different centers. And so there was a, it was a trial for an anticoagulant drug. Um, and, uh, they found that this Chinese center had falsified a whole bunch of patient data and change the results. And if they took that Chinese center's data out of the equation, that drug would have failed. It wouldn't have been more effective than placebo. But even though the FDA busted this group in China, the study that was published on that drug, it's still included that data from the study in China and even studies that were being published 18 months later, still included that data in the original data set.

Speaker 2:          00:52:12       So the FDA busted them, it was clear that they had falsified the data and yet that data is still being included in the studies that doctors are relying on all over the world to make decisions about whether to prescribe these drugs. So there's, there's fraud happening and whether it's, you know, from financial interests or just human error that's not actually being reported and translating into clinical decisions that, that doctors are making. So there are a lot of it. And then the whole peer review process, you mentioned peer review to a, there was a pretty big study where, um, the, the, uh, paper was submitted to Bmj, British Medical Journal and other big medical journal with eight major errors and not a single one of the 221 scientists that were asked to review the paper, caught all of the errors and only 30 percent recommended rejecting the paper.

Speaker 2:          00:53:07       And this was even more problematic because half of those scientists were warned in advance, we're going to give you a paper that has a lot of errors. And, and the ones who were warned didn't get any more of the errors than the scientists that weren't warned in advance. They broke them up into two groups. Is that just lack of time to do the research and people being overwhelmed by a workload? I think that's probably part of it, but it's not really an excuse. I don't know. I mean it's, it's just, it's a problem with peer review because our artist, you know, it is a big part of the scientific method to, to have the results validated by somebody else. Or two, to review the work and make sure that it's sound, but what this paper indicated is that a lot of findings that we take to be true and valid might not actually be true and valid.

Speaker 2:          00:53:55       And you may have heard about this. It actually made the news, um, there was a recent, the open science collaboration did a review of 100 psychology studies and that had never been replicated. Replicating findings is really important in the scientific method to like if you design a study and you do it and you have, you find a certain result in science, it's not really considered to be valid unless I do it and, and confirm your results, you know, or someone else does. It's independent of you. And in a shocking number of studies, this never happens. And so they, this group went back and looked at 100 psychology studies and tried to replicate them using the, you know, almost identical conditions from the original studies. And in they were only able to do that in 35 percent of cases there. Uh, another group looked at a precancer, a clinical studies and found they could only replicate 11 percent of those.

Speaker 2:          00:54:52       It's a well known saying in the pharmaceutical world that, that, like more than half of the drug trials can't be replicated and have a group of researchers from Bayer, from a pharmaceutical company tried to do that in 2011. They took a bunch of trials and try to replicate them less than one quarter of them. They were able to replicate the results. So what this means is, um, you know, a study can be done, it's never validated and then a whole bunch of other studies are done that refer to that study and whole fields of scientific research are spawn on a study that was never confirmed or validated. So it's like a house of cards built on a foundation of falsehood. Well, so, you know, science is great. We need to keep improving science, but there's a lot of problems with the way that studies are performed right now.

Speaker 2:          00:55:42       And it, it's, it's both, you know, conflicts of interest that are based on money and it's just also human human error. And is it also just the overwhelming number of studies that are being done and how many people would have to be there to validate all the different money, money, money basically like a, I've talked to some research, I was just talking to some researchers about this and they said, look, nobody wants to be the second person to discover something. It's just not as cool. I mean, it's not as prestigious for your career. So like going around replicating other people's studies is not as exciting as doing your own original verbally. Yeah, exactly. You're a cover band and you, it's hard to get funding for it to replicate studies. Whereas

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       if you find you have an original finding, especially one that's tied that potential therapeutic use and a drug that can be made out of that, that's where the real money and interest is. So, um, that's one of the big problems. And uh, another one is just how long studies are done for like a omega, Omega three fats. We've all heard about the, these are good for us and you know, fish oil and all of that. When you look at studies, most of those studies are really short term and a back in the seventies or eighties, some longer term studies that are were like eight or 10 years we're done that found really different results for. And what they showed is that early on the results for one way, but the longer the study went on, the results started to go back in the other direction for Omega threes.

Speaker 2:          00:57:11       Yeah. We allow, we can come back to that in a second, but um, the point is like, something that happens in two weeks is not necessarily what's going to happen over four years, but the problem is that the typical studies are only lasts for two or three weeks, especially if they're a randomized trial because they're enormously expensive, you know, to isolate all the variables and make sure that patients are not changing too many different things and are just doing the intervention and to, you know, to do everything that needs to be done is incredibly expensive. And, and so, uh, we have a whole bunch of research findings that are based on two week periods that aren't applicable to how we live our life.

Speaker 3:          00:57:49       That is also, I think, uh, an issue with some anecdotal reports that people have about changing their diet. There's a lot of people that change their diet and short term they feel fantastic and they started having all these benefits. But then over the course of maybe three, four or five years or so, they started having real issues

Speaker 2:          00:58:06       and they don't necessarily tie that to the Diet because they remember feeling so much better when they first switched to it. So they don't think that what they're going, what's happening three or four years later. It could be the cause of their problems. I see this all the time with vegetarian and Vegan diets. That's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:58:24       In terms of that, because most people who switched to a vegetarian or Vegan Diet, you're going to see some instant benefits because of the fact that you have much more nutrient dense foods. You're eating a lot of vegetables. You're, you're, you're changing your diet and a lot of ways to the positive or towards a positive, away from what you were talking about, those primary foods that Americans tend to eat, all the process sugar or the just nonsense and chicken tenders and all that crap that people eat, which is just so goddamn common, right, so automatically over that you're going to see some longterm benefits, but one of the things that I've been reading is about people that have found that over the longterm, the lack. This is contrary to what a lot of people think. Lack of saturated fat and cholesterol, dietary cholesterol and saturated fat leads to hormonal imbalances, leads to your body having a harder time producing sex hormones and all these different with your health or your body almost starts robbing itself to make up for the nutritional deficiencies of your diet.

Speaker 2:          00:59:31       Yeah, yeah. I mean, we talked about this before, but humans are animals. We're, we're, we're omnivores. And wait a minute,

Speaker 3:          00:59:39       I saw a video on youtube. Here's a guy that says there's no way that we're herbivores, and then if we were some fucking wacky dude was saying, if you're really a, an Omnivore, you should be able to eat a squirrel. Just grab it and eat it raw. And like, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:59:55       no, this was the most bizarre, some strange arguments like we shouldn't drink milk because, you know, there were the only, uh, you know, we're the only animal in nature in, in nature that drinks the milk of another animal. Yeah. Well we're the only animal nature that uses iphones to have a whole. It's hilarious. He said that. What else? Appointed people do fly planes, movies, call each other on the phone and tell each other how awesome milk is. It's a ridiculous argument. But, um, so yeah, getting back to, to their ideological arguments more than scientific. Absolutely. Yeah. So it doesn't stand up to scrutiny, but with, with a vegetarian or Vegan Diet. So there's lots of different ways to look at this. This starting with an evolutionary perspective, which I was getting at, um, omnivores or opportunistic, they will eat whatever is available and they'll eat the most nutrient dense foods that are available if they have a choice.

Speaker 2:          01:00:50       And that's just, again, that's survival. You know, that an animal that is able to utilize the nutrients that are available in its environment to its maximum advantage is going to survive compared to one that doesn't. That's basic evolutionary theory. So, um, if you study traditional peoples, as far as I know, still there's never been a traditional pe group that, that has ever been identified that voluntarily followed a Vegan or even vegetarian diet that I know of. So that should tell you something right there. And ironically, the fact that you and I are even having this conversation, this wouldn't even be happening if humans had not learned it's eaten meat. Basically. There are a lot of anthropologists who now believe that eating meat was essentially what made us human. You know, we came down out of the trees and we develop the development of tools that could crack bones to give us access to the marrow, which is super nutrient dense or to sliced meat, which allowed us to be able to digest the meat more quickly.

Speaker 2:          01:01:52       Um, number one. And then to the development of fire, which allowed us to cook meat and cooking makes the nutrients in meat more bioavailable, allowed us to spend less time foraging for food. So most large primates like gorillas or chimpanzees spend over 80 percent of their day foraging for food because most of the foods that we eat are really not nutrient dense. So they have to eat a boatload of stuff and just sit there, chew on the plants all day to get enough nutrients. And, and so this evolutionary theory is that we learned to extract and harvest much more nutrient dense foods from animals, fats and, and other nutrients in the meats and organ meats. And we had, we could then spend a lot less of our time going around getting food which allowed us and then develop bigger brains and you know, become human and have this conversation where we're talking about a vegetarian and Vegan diets.

Speaker 3:          01:02:49       Yeah. It is kind of interesting. And it's also important to differentiate the difference between what you're saying is essentially the science behind the development of the human animal versus the moral and ethical debates that lead environmental and environmental debates. Which is awesome.

Speaker 2:          01:03:08       We can, we can, we can talk about that too.

Speaker 3:          01:03:10       Which would, which is what influences people to become vegetarians and vegans, which I totally respect. I understand what they're saying. The real problem is when they distort the reality of the scientific findings, the human animal and diet. And that's an issue with a lot of people that are vegetarians and vegans that go on about how healthy they feel and about how awesome, but they're not doing blood lipid profiles and when they do like Sam Harris, who is from an ethical perspective for ethical reasons, just tried Vegan diet and his health is suffering. He's giving real issues with his blood lipids. What can someone do if they want to follow that diet? Like what, what is imperative as far as healthy fats as far as getting, making sure that your body doesn't have, you're not taking in too many simple carbohydrates, like what, what, what steps need to be taken place and this is obviously not saying that you shouldn't follow a Vegan diet, it shouldn't follow a vegetarian diet and you do whatever you want to do, but there's gotta be some ways to mitigate some of the health consequences, right?

Speaker 2:          01:04:09       Yeah, there are. And I believe that I agree with you that people should be free to make their own choices. I've never pushed a particular diet. You know, people sometimes ask me, how do you convince someone to go Paleo? I said, I don't, I don't spend my time doing that. If, if someone wants my advice and asked me, I'll give it to them, but we're not going around, you know, proselytizing for a particular way of eating. Um, so yeah, let's break this down. We talked about the evolutionary argument for eating animal products and there's a scientific argument which now is what we're talking about, the issue with [inaudible], we should even kind of distinguish between vegetarian and Vegan diets because they're actually quite different and I think it is possible for some people to be healthy with a vegetarian diet. I think it's a lot less likely with a Vegan diet and I guess I would say it this way.

Speaker 2:          01:05:02       Um, if you have, if you're Vegan and you're eating a Vegan Diet, you need to have a perfect vegan diet to be healthy and you need to know what you're doing in terms of supplementation and how to meet the nutrient needs that aren't being met through diet. And it, at least in my experience, there are very few that actually do it right. Um, when it's done right, I think it's possible for some people to be, to be healthy and thrive. And that's obvious because there are people like rich roll who's out there. He's a Vegan triathlete who's out there doing centuries and killing it, ultra marathon. He, he is just an amazing athlete and he's Vegan and so, you know, you can't say that it's not working for it and if you try to say that you're going to, it looks like he's 30. He's like, yeah, he's a, he's a great guy.

Speaker 2:          01:05:50       I've met him a couple times. Um, and uh, so certainly it works for some people, but there are a lot of factors that determine whether it's gonna work. So one is, is how well you do it. I'm too is you know, whether you know, what you're dealing with supplementation in terms of getting the necessary nutrients. Three is genetics. So let me, there are genetic differences that determine how well we convert precursor nutrients into the nutrients that we actually need. And let me give three examples to make this more real. So one is EPA and Dha. These are these long chain Omega three fats that we've heard so much about that are crucial for brain function, cardiovascular function, etc. And we primarily, you get them by eating fish. There Are no sources of those in a plant based diet except for algae. Um, but an lg is not the bioavailable.

Speaker 2:          01:06:43       Right? And how many people do you know that eat algae? Not. I don't know. You can, you can. There's that famous green supplementation stuff. That's okay. You can use it as a supplement, but very few people are eating it. So, um, but, but there is something called alpha linolenic acid, which is in walnuts and flax seed. That's an omega three plant fat and humans in theory can convert some of that plant based omega three into this long chain epa and dha that we need. But the thing, here's the thing, only about five to 10 percent of that gets converted into epa and even less to dha, like two to five percent. So you have to be chugging tablespoons of flax oil in order to get as much epa or dha that you would get from eating just a little bit of fish. And that's if everything is going well because if you have deficiency of any nutrients that are involved in the enzymatic conversion of those plant based fats into the long chain fats, then you won't make those conversions at that optimal rate.

Speaker 2:          01:07:42       IT'll be even less and ironically many of those nutrients and nutrients that are not well represented in a vegan or vegetarian diet. So that's one example. Another would be vitamin k two, which is a, uh, a different form of vitamin k that's recently been discovered and it's really important for cardiovascular and bone health. It basically puts, make sure that calcium gets in our bones and our teeth and our heart tissues where it belongs and keeps it out of the soft tissues like our arteries, where calcium would make our arteries heart and increase the risk of a heart attack. So I'm two is only really in animal foods with the exception of some fermented foods like natto, which is a japanese fermented soybean product that most people cannot stand. Um, it's, it's a strong taste. Not very many people are eating it here, a kefir and, and sauerkraut and kimchi.

Speaker 2:          01:08:35       You have k, k, two in. It could fear. I've been dot kiefer my whole life. That's how I've never heard it sets how they say it, where firas from every other person I've ever met so says key. So don't worry about it. Okay. I'm saying kaffir from now, ari shaffir fear you'll be in the select few that know how to feel good about it already. So yes, you can feel superior now. Can I stop you real quick just because we're gonna want to get a little bit onto this track of what you were describing. Fish oil conversion and the difference between flax seed oil. What convenience take in order to sort of recommend that vegans take micro algae because it has preformed dha in it. So you bypass that whole conversion issue. If they do take micro algae, is that sufficient or how much different is that than eating fish?

Speaker 2:          01:09:32       Well, it's quite different because fish have a lot of other nutrients aside from epa and dha team, they have salinium. Um, they have a lot of other bioavailable nutrients. But, but, and the other disadvantages, you have to take a boatload of, of algae. Boatload give me a call. I think so there are different products have different amounts. But um, you know, I think you'd have to take six to nine caps capsules a day of the average algae supplement in order to meet your dha. That's not bad. No, it's absolutely possible, but that would be a good way to be healthy with the vegan diet. That would be one way to address the shortcoming of know of lack of dha on the vegan diet. There are other shortcomings, other nutrients like b 12, which are shoe. That's a big issue and vegans need to be supplementing with that.

Speaker 2:          01:10:27       TheRe's a myth out there that there are some plant sources of b12 like seaweed and in spirit like spirulina and nutritional yeast, but those actually contain a kind of phony forms of b 12 that, that can block the absorption of true b12, which is only found in animal products or supplements. So a 12 supplement would be really important as well. It's the source of a b 12 supplement. Um, they, it's synthetic, it's synthetic I think, but they just, there's three forms of be 12, there's, there's hydroxocobalamin and methylcobalamin or, or four forms that you can supplement with cyanocobalamin and adenosylcobalamin and cyanocobalamin is a synthetic form. And then the other ones are natural forms of b, 12 that you would encounter in food. So people can supplement with any of those, the natural forms, they're better to supplement with because they're more bioavailable. But definitely if a vegan, I would recommend supplementing with b 12 because there aren't any sources of it in the diet.

Speaker 2:          01:11:32       And studies have shown that 68 percent of vegetarians are deficient in b, 12. 80 three percent of vegans are versus just five percent of omnivores. Wow. So it's a big difference. We're not, you know, and that's a factor in, in many different issues, right? It's A factor in the production of muscle, uh, all production of all red blood cells depends on [inaudible] and full eight. And so I mean that's pretty fundamental, right? And then the myelin sheath requires be 12. And this is why b, 12 deficiency can mimic the signs of parkinson's or alzheimer's to these people who are aging. B, 12 deficiency happens in elderly people, not because they're on a vegan diet beat because they have low stomach acid and they don't absorb the b12 as well as we do when we're younger. And so a lot of people who are elderly who have symptoms of parkinson's or alzheimer's, they can sometimes be misdiagnosed with these conditions when they're actually just be 12 deficient.

Speaker 2:          01:12:27       So it's a series. It's a real, really important nutrient. Now, how can a vegans be assured that the [inaudible] that they're buying does not have a animal products? Uh, do, do they have betweeN when you bind the supplement fat typically it's usually safe. Yeah. Uh, I'm not the best person to ask about that because I'm, I'm not a vegan myself. I was a macrobiotic vegan at one point. What does that mean? What's the difference? That's deep. It's like a macrame. Macrobiotics is a, is a whole nother system of way of looking at food. It's a job, You know, japanese, uh, approach and um, you know, the whole reason I came to do what I'm doing now. So I goT really, really sick in my twenties. I almost died and I spent about 10 years just trying to get back to health. And what did you pick from?

Speaker 2:          01:13:19       I was in Indonesia. I mentioned earlier, I'd traveled around the world. I was surfing and I got the classic tropical illness, like immediate dysentery, giardia and blast assistance, hominis so to parasites and an amoeba and was just, you know, coming out of both ends, delirious, didn't remember really anything for three days. Um, luckily there was one other australian guy in the village that I was in who had some antibiotics and this medical kit that kind of brought me back from the brink, but between the parasites and then the multiple rounds of antibiotics I had to take to get rid of the parasites after that, it just wreaked havoc on my gut and it took me basically 10 years to recover. Oh yeah, 10 years. It was like the last decade when I was at 10 years because you approached it incorrectly and you could do it now or was

Speaker 1:          01:14:11       it just such a devastating round of disease?

Speaker 2:          01:14:15       I think a little of both. I mean I'm 42 now and I was 25 when this first happened and we didn't know anything about the gut and the microbiome compared to what we know now. Like there was very little awareness on that point. Yeah. Just in 15 years, it's just, or 20 years, it's, it's crazy. So, you know, I Took way more antibiotics than I would have done in retrospect because that's what the doctors were prescribing and saying, look, you've got these parasites, we got to get rid of them. This is how you do it and you know, and I think the antibiotics if could have been like the treatment was probably worse than the disease for me at that, you know, after the number of courses of antibiotics that I took. So along that path I tried to spell everY special diet you can possibly imagine including becoming a vegetarian and a vegan and then a macrobiotic vegan and raw food vegan.

Speaker 2:          01:15:08       I've been there, done that and I'm. so I'm completely sympathetic like to all. And I'm also a longtime meditater in buddhist. So I understand the ethical argument very well. Many of my friends don't eat meat. I'm sympathetic and I'm, I, I care about the environment. I'm sympathetic to that argument. I'm certainly not, you know, I'm coming to this from a place of I think a pretty balanced viewpoint. Um, and uh, the, the issues for me, the reason why I eventually brought animal products back into my diet was that I, I, it became clear that I needed to do that for my own health and I was able to reach a level of understanding and a about the moral, ethical and environmental choices that I was making. Um, that, that I felt good about.

Speaker 1:          01:16:03       Sam has brought up mollusks. He was saying that one option that vegans might want to consider is mollusks and that mollusks mollusks mollusks what a weird word, clams, mussels. Things along those lines are so primitive that the argument can be made that although they have movement where they open and close, that they lacked pain sensors. They lack, like the fundamental things that make us distinguish the difference between animal and plant life and that people might want to consider the consumption of mollusks same way they consider it. People eat mushrooms, mushrooms which are in a vegan diet or healthy or closer to an animal than they are to a plant. They actually take in oxygen. They breathe out carbon dioxide and fundamentally they reSemble living organisms that we consider like animals more than they consider plants more than they resemble places. Really

Speaker 2:          01:17:00       good point. And it starts, the lines start to get blurry because we know that some plants, for example, when they recognize that they're being eaten by a, they secrete toxins to protect themselves,

Speaker 3:          01:17:12       not just recognize that they're being eaten, but they've played recordings of the caterpillar eating a plant next to a plant and it's changed the actual taste of the leaves to the point where animals find them disgusting and it causes some animals to starve to death.

Speaker 2:          01:17:30       Not some level of awareness. I mean, you may not call that intelligence or sanctions, but it's some, you know, what's the difference there between um, a mollusk for example, who, that like you described blAcks, pain sensors and you know, what should we be prioritizing in that situation if we are, if we're using an ethical argument against eating meat, there's even thornier issue, which is there's no system of food production that does not involve the death of animals, it and. correct. So if you think about monocropping big, you know tiller with blades going through these fields, you're killing vols, you're killing rabbits, you're killing snakes, you're killing all kinds of small animals and is the value of a small animal life less than the value of a large animal life. Some philosophers or people who look at this morally have actually argued that killing a larger before like a cow that can feed many people is superior ethically or morally. Then you know a method of food production that kills many small animals in order to, you know, and won't feed as many people can. People treat density per. Don't like to look at that

Speaker 3:          01:18:42       because it's inconvenient. But I have friends that I have a good buddy of mine who has a farm in Iowa and he says when they run the combines over corn and grain and chopped down all the different things that they grow. You'll see vultures and crows and all these things circling the fields because there's all sorts of animals that get chewed up in that process. And in fact, more animals get chewed up to create a pound of grain. Like more animals, more more insects, more, I mean when insects are animals by the way, there are a life form and more different things get chewed up in creating that then would be if you've got a pound of meat, because as you said, one cow could to consolidate. A lot of people consume it over the course of a year and

Speaker 2:          01:19:29       the nutrient density is far superior to a pound of grains or even an equivalent amount of weight

Speaker 3:          01:19:36       grains, which you don't hear that argument. You hear the opposite argument where a cow consumes so much grass, it needs so much land to graze and that argument, unfortunately it's actually been distorted. I had some guys on from the documentary cowspiracy, which I don't think they were intentionally trying to deceive. I think they're really good guys and they're making, they're, they think they're making a really good point, but when you talk to ranchers and you get the actual number of how much acreage it takes to feed a cow, it's not as much as they thought it was. No, we can talk about that too. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       the, the, the, the interest to ethical argument is really interesting too for all of these reasons, but then you think about the method of death, right? So let's take like a, a humane slaughterhouse where there's a lot of care and consideration that goes into how the animals last moments are and how they actually slaughter the animals so that it's painless and quick. I can hear the vegans going crazy right now. This is jumbo shrimp. This is military intelligence is versus let's see this, this combine that goes through the field decapitates the mother vole and her babies in the nest die of starvation because their mother is not able to provide food for them. That's a, that's a arguably worse way for an animal to die. Right? Or even any of your rancher friends know what it's like, you know, they found one of their animals that's been killed by a predator.

Speaker 4:          01:21:00       And if you go on youtube and watch how like a hyena kill an animal to animal will still be alive while it's getting disemboweled yeah, that's not a very nice way to die. Right? And that's what wolves will do. And that's what I mean, that's a, that's a giant issue. The difference between the way a predator kill something in the way a person does, but on the other hand, of course it's impossible to deny the real issues with factory farming and the inhumane methods that are so common when you're buying these chicken nuggets. I guarantee you these are not ethically sourced ethically and humanely raised chickens. They're just not and know when you're driving on the highway and you see those trucks that are stuffed full of chickens and the chickens literally the little faces or poking out of the side of the truck that, that, that is in my opinion, a bigger issue.

Speaker 4:          01:21:44       Absolutely. And this is, I mean, interestingly enough, this is something where I think I have more in common with vegans than I do with like the average person is we both care about how food is produced. We care about, you know, I don't eat factory farmed meat. I don't eat factory farmed vegetables. You know, like I, I try to eat meat that's from local, from local farmer. I'm lucky that where I live, that that's accessible. Um, I buy produce from the farmers market, we grow a lot of produce in our backyard. Um, it's this whole food system that needs to change both in terms of conventional agriculture and the monocropping of wheat and corn and, and, and these kinds of and soybeans and plant foods, but also the, you know, mass production, conventional, um, a animal operations need to change as well. So I'm not arguing for that.

Speaker 4:          01:22:41       And I think that's absolutely a losing argument, but there is a lot of land that two thirds of the surface land in this in the world is not suitable for crop production and we, but it is suitable for raising animals. And, and if those animals are raised in a sustainable way, um, it, I think it is possible to feed the world with, you know, maybe not the amount of animal products that the average american is eating now. But, uh, we can utilize the available land in a much smarter way to produce nutrient dense foods. And we just, you know, we need to consider the whole cycle. Like we, we like to remove ourselves from the cycle of life and from nature. We're not animals, we're humans or separate from it. But when you consider that whole cycle and when you consider like the soil, for example, if you think you think of it as a bank account, when you plant crops, you're withdrawing from that bank account and if you want the soil to be healthy and continue to be able to support life, you need to put input.

Speaker 4:          01:23:43       You need To make a deposit back in that bank account. And the way we've been doing that in conventional agriculture is with, is with chemicals and thOse chemical fertilizers, they do kind of make a deposit in some way, but they also make it less the soil, less able to sequester carbon. They cause all kinds of problems with runoff and gi toxicity and water and local watershed systems. Um, and any organic farmer will tell you that the best way to add those inputs back in is the poop of animals along with their blood and their bone. And so that's that cycle of life where the animal inputs go into the soil. Those inputs, you know, the urine adds water to the soil, the poop ads, microorganisms that help the soil sequester carbon so that studies have shown that pasture raised animals are either net neutral in terms of carbon out put her, they actually even help sequester carbon so you could even argue that raising animals and eating animals is necessary for the benefit of our soils and our ecosystems in general yet, so if someone has has a, a large, you know, 20 acre plot of land and the using it to grow alfalfa or something that people eat or soybeans or something along those lines.

Speaker 4:          01:24:58       If they're not in some way contributing some sort of animal product to that soil, the soil is going to become nutritionally deficient and then the people who eat the plants that come out of that soil are going to get nutritionally deficient. Plants minerally deficient in particular that it's a giant issue with the United States farmlands. There's a booklet. It's received a lot of criticism, but it brings up some interesting points. It's called dead doctors don't lie. It's this guy dr joel wallach and a lot of is the things that he said have been rightly criticized, but what's interesting about what he's saying is when he's talking about minerally deficient plants and soil and that the United States is known, you know, when they've done studies on farm lands in the 19 thirties and forties, that there was an issue with mineral deficiency and so, um, that's where they started adding nitrogen and from, from the hopper method, you know, in, into soil and it helps and you can grow crops, but the difference between the food that you're getting that is grown with chemical fertilizers that address sOme of the issues that you're talking abouT versus the traditional method of compost and manure and animal products.

Speaker 4:          01:26:13       Like you're getting away healthier plant and when you're consuming it, you're getting a far more nutrient dense plant. Right? Not to mention the environmental implications of chemical fertilizers. Pesticides, I know dial got bone cancer because he grew up next to a golf course and the pesticides and all the shit that they would pump onto thE golf course to keeP the weeds from growing. Got into the well system And a bunch of people in this community like a huge amount got cancer, right. I want to go back to something you were saying about, you know, vegans and vegetarians anD how to kind of optimize if you're doing that diet. So, um, two things that I wanted to address. One was you asked about mollusks and that I've actually argued that a vegetarian diet with shellfish and organ meats would be better than a paleo diet with no shellfish and organ meats.

Speaker 4:          01:27:06       Interesting. And that's Because what we talked about earlier, muscle meats, organ meats and shellfish are the two most nutrient dense classes of foods. Like I, I've just been finishing the curriculum for my clinician training program where I'm going through systematically every nutrient and I'm looking at in nutrition data what the most, the highest food sources for those nutrients are. And again, I wish I had the thing to just lay it out and show you. But you know, in almost every case it's an organ meat or a shellfish. that's the highest source of that. Whether you're talking about 12 or iron or copper or zinc or full eight, it's always beef, liver, chicken, liver, clams, oysters, et cetera. And so if someone was a veggie vegetarian who was willing to fudge a little bit and eat organ meats and shellfish, I think that would be a healthier approach than someone who's just eating lean muscle.

Speaker 4:          01:28:04       Neat. Um, organs get tossed out a lot. It's a really. It's a real problem in the hunting world where when people got an animal, they leave the gut pile and there's even a gutless method that a lot of people use when they, uh, they take on a big game animal, like an elk or something like that. They just, they leave it behind. They leave the heart, they leave the liver. But I saw this documentary on wolves and was really fascinating was one of the ways that they distinguish who the alpha is. In the wolf pack is the alpha wolf is the one who eats the liver the liver faster. There are other animals that that's true. And I think that was true in hunter gather societies as well. And someone was trying to say to me, well, we'll livers process toxins, don't you think they'd be filled with toxins?

Speaker 4:          01:28:46       That's a common misconception. The liver processes then, but the, the fat stores them. So if you're concerned about toxins in food, you should make sure that you're eating, you know, pasture raised, organic fats like butter and cream and thing. If you dairy products, animal fats, grass fed, grass fed butter, if you eat lard or tallow or anything like that, it should come from pasture raised animals because the fat is where toxins are stored. The liver processes. then, um, so when you, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but so when you're eating anything that comes from an animal that's been fed grain, you're dealing with an animal that has the same sort of inflammation issuEs that a Person hAs from processing things that it's not naturally supposed to process. Like pat processed wheat and the bleached flour and things besides antibiotic residue. Yeah. So when you're taking in those animal products that we traditionally do, whether it's butter or milk or dairy or cheese or things along those lines, when you're taking those from an animal that's eating grain, you're actually getting the fats.

Speaker 4:          01:29:52       So your, your, it's less healthy than actually eating the liver of that animal. Yeah, I would. It may be. I mean the liver is more nutrient dense anyways. But um, pasture raised animal fats a have a lot more nutrients than conventionally raiseD fats because the animals are eating grass and grasses way more nutrient dense than the grains that, you know, conventional animals are fed. Also, the omega threes and sixes are different. The ratio a mega six is the same, but omega three is three or four times higher in pasture raised animals. Why does it make it six percent? It's a good question. It's, it used to be the kind of a consensus was that omega sixes would be higher in omega threes will be lower, but it actually looks like omega six is constant and omega three is higher. The omega three is higher because of the grass probably has more alpha linolenic acid, which is the plant based form, uh, that day.

Speaker 4:          01:30:48       Then animal does the conversion. I mean, that's the thing that's really interesting to, to consider here too is humans are really inefficient at making these conversions of these less active nutrients to the more active ones. We started talk about it with epa and dha, k, k, vitamin k, one is what's converted into k two cows are experts at doing that. They're really good at it. HumanS not so much. So when we eat the animal, the animals basically done the work for us. We get the preformed final nutrient that we need rather than having to do those steps ourselves and starting to rub is, is this a function of the adaptation of people developing while eating these animals? I think so, yeah. A beta carotenes another example that's a precursor to active vitamin a or retinol and beta carotenes have some benefits in our bodies, but retinols is the real thing.

Speaker 4:          01:31:39       You know, what we need more than anything. And uh, that conversion is as low as three to five percent. And some people on facts there, there are some who don't make the conversion at all and those are the people who turn orange after a carrot juice fast, ever see me when I'm with like the orange palms. but it happens. My friend andy used to drink so much characteristic the inside of his hands and his skin would turn orange so he probably wasn't good at converting beta carotene into retinol because we should be able to do that. But some people can't but isn't just the mass quantities. I mean it could be that too, but I'm a retinol is only really present in organ meats and pasture raised fats. It's not even really in muscle meats like, you know, lean ground beef or chicken breast, boneless chicken breast or um, so in order to get retinol we need to consume these pasture raise.

Speaker 4:          01:32:30       Fats are where we need to consume organ meats. And as you pointed out, we're going to be. It's really fallen out of favor in the us. And this is only recent, like I bet you our grandparents ate a lot more organ meats than we eat still in some parts of the world. They still eat organ meats more try. We do liver and onions are very famous dish. Yeah. Yeah. It's hard. And so you'll see like within the paleo, primal kind of world, the organ meats are making a comeback because we understand now with the nutrient density of these foods is and there's less now even in the mainstream world, there's less of a solid argument that can be made about these having cholesterol or high levels of saturated fat. It would prevent us from meeting them now, will it be the difference in terms of the nutritional density of mollusks versus organ meat?

Speaker 4:          01:33:19       So like if you were trying, if you had a vegetarian or a vegan who's on the fence and you know, you made these arguments that are very rational and logical and you said it, look, mollusks are essentially a very, very primitive form of life that doesn't feel pain. And you could argue that there's more evidence that some plants feel pain and plants also have some very intense level of communication where there, there's a really interesting, uh, uh, addition of radio lab recently where they went into this were they sort of are trying to understand the difference between, uh, the, not the difference rather, but the, the complicated relationship between these different plants and the mycelium in the soil and all of the different fungus in the soil that also acts as sort of a transportation method. The various nutrients and minerals. And they're actually pulling these minerals out of the rock and they're getting sugars from the plants and they're exchanging them for minerals.

Speaker 4:          01:34:15       And that there's this really complex interaction that we have sort of just looked at and said, oh, there's dirt. There's plants in it. But there's a lot going on between these various life forms. And one of them being fungus, which again is closEr to an animal than it is to a PlAnt, but is imperative for the life of these plants. AnD then somehow know that there were actually even sharing resources where if they find or they're allotting resources to certain plants that are more deficient or they're trying to channel resources to them. So there's some form of communication and exchange here. Yeah, that's, that's intelligence, right? I mean, paul stamets has done amazing work on this youngest in.

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       Yeah, I would say that that's a really good option. I mean, when you look at nutrients like specific nutrients that it goes back and forth between liver and, you know, organ meats and shellfish and some, some nutrients. A organ meats are higher like vitamin a or iron and other nutrients. Shellfish are generally higher like with zinc or copper. Um, but certainly even, even a shellfish are higher in almost all of the key nutrients that we need. Then a lot of the plant based food alternatives that they would be choosing from. And so if it's a vegan was willing to eat molluscs I would say that that would be a great idea. And, and, uh, the benefit there is you don't need to eat a lot, like three ounces, a single serving a can meet your copper requirement for the entire week. Oh wow. just one time.

Speaker 2:          01:35:49       Waste oysters and I've history and same with iron. I think if I'm going off the top of my head, I'll iron and zinc. It can nearly meet your entire weekly requirement. So it's not like you have to eat a ton of these things. You, you know, you have a serving of clams once a week and you have a serving of oysters once a week, uh, you know, on top of the, uh, getting as much nutrient density as you can, that should do, that'll be 12. That's iron that sink. That's copper, epa and dha. The launching of omega three fats are in these, uh, in these mollusks because as well, uh, and they're typically low on the toxicity, a scale to. They're not, they don't tend to hAve a lot of mercury. They don't bio accumulate a lot of toxins compared to some other predator species of fish that are higher in the food chain that accumulated a lot of toxins.

Speaker 2:          01:36:40       Is there any benefit to eating them cooked versus raw one way or the other? Well, you know, there's all, there is the chance of disease in eating raw oysters. Um, I think it's pretty minimal compared to some other risks, but it is there and cooking, you know, mitigates that. So definitely I think in general cooking makes the nutrients in meat and animal products more bioavailable rather than less. Uh, and that's in vegetables. It's, it depends on the vegetable and the um, and the method of cooking. But a, it, it's a mix. It's more of a mixed bag, but with me to generally improve the bioavailability. So it really is in a lot of ways an ideological issue where it's sort of framed that, you know, you don't want to contribute to suffering, but these things really don't suffer there. Yeah. But even there, you know, as we talked about, you're going to control, you're gonna contribute to suffering and potentially more if you're looking on the scale of individual lives, and it might sound like this is nitpicky, but it's not. we're talking about actual lives, you know, and, and then you have to start evaluating like is a cow more attention or worth the life of the cow worth more than the life of a rabbit or a

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       fall or the kind of animals that are being killed. And you know, in the production of these plant foods, um, it's a real question. And then you have insecticides and you have, you know, the amount of insects that get her killed. Killed. yeah. When you're processing crops, there's just no getting around. If you're buying anything that is from large scale agriculture, you were involved in the death of some sort of animals or insects. And I know the argument is like, there's an argument about intentionality and whether, you know, if, if, if I intended to kill this animal to eat it, it's different than if you didn't intend to eat it. To me that's, I'm not so sure about that. Yeah, because it's, it's almost like willful ignorance that, that, um, that these animals are being killed in the production of these plants that I'm eating.

Speaker 4:          01:38:48       I mean, I see the argument, but I'm not sure I buy it. I do as well. And I see the willful ignorance argument up until the point where it gets explained to you. So as soon as someone explained to you like you've just done about the combines and how they're chewing up all these animals. And by the way fonz too, it's a huge issue with deers because if you've ever seen a baby deer out in the wild, there's one of the weirdest things about them. When they're very young, they do not move. So in the face of danger, they have this instinct freeze so you can literally go up to a fawn and they'll, they'll be tucked up on the ground and they're healthy, completely healthy. And you could walk right next to the font and the headlights. Yeah. You could stomp on the ground next to them. They don't move.

Speaker 4:          01:39:27       They sit around and wait for their mother to retail. It's really interesting. They get chewed up by combines. It's really. I mean because these animals bed in these fields all the time and if something happens to the mother, especially if she gets attacked by a coyote or something along those lines and then the babies just get chewed up by the, by the combines. There's, yeah. There's another interesting question here too, which is more around like privilege and again like whether we see ourselves as part of the ecosystem and the food cycle or as separate from it. Did you think about like native american or traditional hunter gather or even contemporary people living in let's say in Afghanistan and all they can they have is a goat, you know, and they. Or a poor family in India who has access to a backyard cow, should they not eat, you know, milk and butter and those animal foods because of moral or ethical argument against that, or it seems like an argument coming from a tremendous place of privilege for, for us to, to say that the choices that they make are somehow wrong or immoral because they, you know, we can afford to make these different choices in defense of vegans.

Speaker 4:          01:40:46       I never hear that argument honestly. I see. I think I hear the argument that in America today you have the choice and in westernized you have the choice

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       and so that you can choose to contribute less to suffering, which I think ideologically makes a lot of sense. The problem is when you deal with the reality of it that you've sort of described about large scale agriculture, you're not. It means you're not immune to the suffering of animals in the death. It's just, it's just not the case. Especially when you talk about insects. I mean it's just, there's no way. It's just an insects, at least. I mean, in my mind are more complex and more complicated than mollusks.

Speaker 2:          01:41:26       Yeah, I mean certainly the, if you look at some of the studies on an insect behavior, that's, I think that would be born out. Yeah. But we have these like weird hierarchy, so we love bees. Bees are super important. These are another species that gets totally decimated by factory farming. Pesticides. Pesticides are really, really harmful for the bees. Um, yeah. I mean I agree with you. I think there is, you can say we have this because we have that privilege. We have the imperative not to cause more suffering, but I think what I get out of looking at those cultures is it's more clear to me how intertwined with with nature and the natural food systems that humans are in those circumstances, they're less removed from the basic cycle of life and it, it seems natural. And when you, you know, for the mussai pastoralist people to, to, to drink the blood of the cows and eat and drink the milk and eat the meat because that's inexorably intertwined to their culture and their way of life.

Speaker 2:          01:42:29       So that's why they survived. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, you know, I think this is a really nuanced, complex topic and there's a lot more to it than is typically shows up in the internet debates of that. Just go back and forth. But at the end of the day, from what I've seen as a clinician working with a lot of patients, a lot of ex vegans, a lot of ex vegetarians, is that some people can pull it off for a relatively long period of time and I think this is because they have the genes and the preexisting nutrient status and allows them to make those conversions of a less active nutrients to the more active forms. I'm better than the average person. Then you see someone who goes on a vegan diet and falls apart within a couple of months and this is the person who does not have the genes to make the, you know, they're poor converter and they also probably had preexisting nutrient deficiencies which made them less able to make those conversions. and so this kind of solves the question of, or addresses the question you hear some people say, well, why does that person, that person does a vegan diet? And he's pretty healthy, you know, like you're rich roll. Um, so it can't be, can't be problematic. Well, look, we don't all respond the same way to the same choices. Yeah, of course. BIo, the, the difference in

Speaker 4:          01:43:51       the way human beings respond to various foods can obviously be exhibited really quickly and easily with allergies. Food allergies, absolutely. How many people, I mean, we all know someone who has, like my friend brian, his mother, if she eats a Brazil nut, she's dead and she will chew those things all day and nothing happens other than I get bored with them, especially if she has to pay 600 bucks for an epi pen. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of different things that show the biodiversity of just human beings when we come from different parts of the world. Our ancestors came from different parts of the world. They developed and evolved under different diets. And that's where I think paleo is kind of fallen like a. Maybe has been less successful as a concept then it could have been otherwise. I really believe there's no one size fits all approach to diet or life in general.

Speaker 4:          01:44:49       But um, you know, if you take two different people, for example, like a off a person who is primarily sedentary, it works in an office, 60 pounds overweight, you know, prediabetic, um, you know, not doing really any physical activity. And then you take someone like Michael Phelps who's super athlete training, you know, burning calories every day. It's clear. It's clear to me that they're going to need a completely different dietary approach. Even if we talk about within a certain template or are, you know, choice of foods, you know, Michael Phelps is going to need a lot more carbohydrate. He's going to need lot higher calorie intake in general. He's going to need more nutrients. He's gonna need to be eating more regularly. You know, intermittent fasting is not going to work for him probably. Um, but it's amazing to me how often that is completely left out of the equation.

Speaker 4:          01:45:38       When, when, when there's discussion of diets, you see, you know, the books on everyone should be on a low fat diet. Then the next crazy low carb, everyone, you know, carbs are toxic. We shouldn't eat carbs and then you know, everyone should be on paleo and never touched another grain or lagoon or dairy product for the rest of their life. You know, that's just stupid. That's not the way it works is really important when you're talking about people like ultra marathon runners or people like Michael Phelps or just burning off massive amounts of calories. When you think about how much energy is involved in those sprints that he's doing across the pool and the training for those, which is just unbelieVably grueling. Yeah. I read this thing about him eating like several pizzas at night and you look at him and he's shredded. It doesn't zero body fat, like obviously his body's doing something with that.

Speaker 4:          01:46:25       It's kind of important. I think that is very important. Also when you're talking about sedentary lifestyles, contributing to diseases and in factors like high blood pressure and clogging of the arteries and you're just, your, your body is less likely to be healthy when you're not doing much with it, period. AbSolutely. And uh, I mean, I think that can work both ways. On the one hand, phelps would probably be better off choosing a different calorie source than pizzas, you know, arguably, I don't know. But uh, so he can get away with a lot more than I can say that he shouldn't be doing anything differently than what is the most successful swimmer. Isn't he like the most successful olympian? I think. Yeah. I don't think anyone's one any more gold medal. So what the heck do I know? Just keep on doing whatever you're doing. It's working.

Speaker 4:          01:47:16       Um, no, but I think genes play a role, you know, for sure you take a coming back to people like michael are rich, like I think rich could probably eat, almost, could have a lot of different diets and still be and still be phenomenal. I've had rich on the podcast before and he sort of explained his transition to being a vegan and it came from being really unhealthy and eating terrible, piss poor diet, eating super healthy and eating a really nutrient dense vegetables constantly and only that primarily and you know, obviously had a massive benefit from changing from the standard american diet that you outlined to this vegan diet. Right. MAkes you wonder what he, you know, what might have happened if he had done switch to like a paleo diet. Oh, don't say that. So nobody wants to hear that. Right. It's like, it's not, it's, it's one of those things that gets a hit.

Speaker 4:          01:48:11       There's an ideological wall that cannot be crossed and so no one even wants to look at the possibility of it being physically beneficial. You just say, that is not an option. I'm a vegan and this is what I do. That's fine. You know, I don't, like I said, I'm not invested in changing anyone's mind about that. Nor should you be. Yeah. Um, I want to go back to two things. One thing I want to go back to was your, you're talk about talking about fish oil, like the long term, uh, negative aspects of consuming fish oil. Like what were those? So, um, early on, I mean the history is kind of important to see how, because it illustrates the number of principles that we've been talKing about. So early research that, you know, they looked at traditionally knew it people and said, wow, these people don't really have heart disease.

Speaker 4:          01:48:55       What is it about their diet that could explain this? Wow. They eat mostly seal blubber and they have enormous intake of omega three fats, so it could be an omega three fats and then they start doing research and they find that there is an inverse association between omega three fat consumption, like in seafood and cardiovascular disease risk. In other words, people who eat more fish have fewer heart attacks and die of cardiovascular disease, much less. Okay. So pretty promising so far. So then it's like, okay, why don't we then give people fish oil supplements? And so they give people fish oil supplements. They do some, some research on that, that short term. And find that yes, there are, there do appear to be some benefits from fish oil supplementation, short term, but then over a longer period of time and met analysis

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       of longer term studies. They find that the benefits of fish oil I've probably been significantly overstated. And then in fact in some cases high doses of fish oil for an extended period of time actually appear to cause harm. And so there are few few important principles here. Number one is the the folly of looKing at one super isolated unusual population like the traditional in us who live in a really marginalized environment and looking at their diet and then extrapolating that to us who don't live in the arctic and don't have their diet or lifestyle and didn't evolve. You can evolve up there. And, and interestingly enough, some recent studies have found that the nun have certain genetic adaptations that allow them to thrive on very high doses of omega three, which we don't have. So, so that illustrates the problem with taking, you know, saying, oh this works for the anyway, so it should work for us.

Speaker 2:          01:50:51       it doesn't actually work that way. And now we know why, it's because of the genetics. Um, the second folly and this happens all the time and it's kind of a uniquely american thing. It's like, oh, a little bit as good. Well, a lot must be even better. That's me as he stares. Is bullet proof coffee over there? Yeah. Um, so yeah, I, uh, I, I think what is becoming more clear is that eating fish is good. Taking really high doses of fish oil for a long period of time may not be now what were the negative health benefits or the negative health effects rather well, an increase in cardiovascular disease risk in some cases and increase in some inflammatory markers. The thing to understand about omega three fats is they're very fragile. so fats have different levels of susceptibility to something called oxidative damage, which means a [inaudible] and they combine with oxygen and the fat becomes damaged and rancid and then can be harmful.

Speaker 2:          01:51:56       And that's, you know, brief description without going into the science. Um, and so saturated fats, because they are saturated with hydrogen atoms, they're not susceptible to oxidative damage and they're relatively stable. It can tolerate the application of temperature, like when you cook with it or light, you know, so if they're stored in a clear jar, they're not going to decompose and become rancid. Whereas polyunsaturated fats are, are lacking in hydrogen atoms. They become more susceptible to oxidative stress. and the most unsaturated fats are the long chain omega three fats. So this means that they, this is why you don't cook, you never hear anyone saying that you should cook with fish oil. You know, if you cook with it, you'll, you'll damage the fats will become rancid and oxidize. This is why fish oil is stored in opaque bottles to protect it from light because if light hits it, it will oxidize and become rancid.

Speaker 2:          01:52:54       And the suspicion is that if we eat, you know, we take these high doses of unsaturated fat, we actually increased the risk of oxidative stress, which can cause inflammation, which in turn is the root of all chronic disease. So, um, what I advise my patients is, you know, just eat fish and if for some reason you can't eat fish or won't eat fish, then taking some, some fish oil. Um, I prefer cod liver oil because it has vitamins a and d in addition to epa and dha, but at a relatively low dose or moderate dose, you know, maybe like a teaspoon a day, um, rather than going for like 20 grams or 15 grams a day of fish oil. So the real issue is in the oxidative stress. So, and also the, the, so the potential of something being rancid sort of mitigates or a diminishes all the positive benefits from it.

Speaker 2:          01:53:53       But if you can be assured that there was no rancid, well no because it can become damaged in your body. So there's two types of data. It can be damaged by heat or lighting outside of your body. That's less of an issue because storage, you know, people know this, the producers of these oils, no it. So they store them in, in a opaque bottles and when you get the fish oil, you're instructed to put it in the refrigerator, preserve it, but inside of your body, the fats can become oxidized to. And historically, when you look at traditional diets, you see that the majority of fat is, comes from saturated or mono unsaturated fat and there's only a small amount of fat that comes, it's polyunsaturated that they would get from eating nuts or seeds which are pretty high in polyunsaturated fats and olives. All of olive oil has some avocados, has some polyunsaturated fats, omega sixes, um, but there weren't, you know, there wasn't really an opportunity for them to be getting really high doses of polyunsaturated fat that you would get from taking multiple fish oil capsules in a day.

Speaker 2:          01:55:03       Um, so that. So that's the issue. And that's also actually why industrialized seed oils are bad for us. You know, things like corn oil, soybean oil, a sunflower and safflower, like all the stuff that's in chips and crackers and cookies and restaurant foods primarily is that when those oils get heated, they become rancid. And those rancid oils can be harmful. Wow. That is really important information. You know, it's also interesting, you're bringing up cod liver oil that's more like sort of ancient knowledge. Grandma and grandpa people would have you take a tablespoon of cod liver oil. You build

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       your house. When they were right, we talked about retinol, vitamin a, the active form of vitamin a in how it's not found in very many foods, just organ meats and pasture raised fats and a cod liver oil is from liver cod livers and the oil is very high in vitamin a. It's also high in vitamin d, which a lot of people are deficient in a and it's has epa and dha. So again, this is traditional wisdom. Our ancestors knew. They had, you know, they may not have scientifically understood what the benefit was, but they, they knew through trial and error. That is really interesting. Here's another thing that I wanted to bring up that we talked about earlier. The misconception that unsat, that saturated fats rather saturated fats and cholesterol are bad for you. You know, um, this is something that you hear vegans talk about all the time.

Speaker 4:          01:56:37       They don't do videos about it as saturated fats are terrible for you and it's just not true. Yeah. Unfortunately, they're not current with the science. I mean, even the us dietary guidelines now have no restriction on dietary cholesterol. So the most recent version of the dietary guidelines, you look at him, there is no restriction on dietary cholesterol. So the vegans are aligning themselves with science that's decades old at this point and they're out of step even with the conventional, totally vanilla mainstream dietary guidelines. I don't think they care. I think it's an ideological thing. Yeah. I think this is something that they have. They have their bullet points and saturated fats bad. Yeah. And they go to at saturated fats, consumption of animal products, bad cholesterol, bad. So this is based on, uh, an old understanding of how heart disease develops, which is kind of the pipe analogy we can call it.

Speaker 4:          01:57:28       So like break it down for us, chris, saturated fat and cholesterol are like gunk that clog up your pipes, right? That's kinda how we all were taught, you know, we all conceive of it. Um, so you eat, you know, a burger and egg yolks and that just gradually will build up and you know, as gunk in your arteries and eventually those arteries clogged. And the occlusion of the arteries, this is what causes a heart attack because blood can't get through to the heart and it causes a, an ischemic event, no oxygen, heart attack, um, or you know, platforms. And then the plaque ruptures and that in it blocks the artery and blood can't get to the heart and you have a heart attack. So that's kinda the, the dominant idea. And it turns out it's not actually true. Um, for one thing, there was actually just a study published that reviewed all of the randomized clinical trials that looked at substituting saturated polyunsaturated fat for saturated fat. So they took away people's butter and gave them corn oil and soybean oil, which I don't know how they found that people were willing to take that trade. But, um, vegans, yeah. This, this was at a time where saturated fat was seen as harmful and they probably gave them margarine. You know, some

Speaker 2:          01:58:41       of that other stuff. Remember when that was supposed to be good. I can't believe it's not butter, right? So terrible for you. It's hard to find it now. And so they reviewed 10 studies and they found that only one supported this notion, one of 10 supported this notion that, that replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat, which was good for you, and even that study was flawed because a much higher percentage of people in the control group were we're smoke were smokers, and um, had some other characteristics that would have made them more susceptible to having heart disease independent of whatever, what's going on with their diet. WaS that intentional? No, It was poorly designed study. Uh, I dunno, I mean, I guess it depends on whether you think the researchers were trying to get a particular outcome or whether you think it was just poor design.

Speaker 2:          01:59:36       Um, so there's the early studies suggested that if you eat more saturated fat and cholesterol, the cholesterol level in your blood would go up and they use that as a way of. And then everyone knew that high cholesterol in your blood causes heart attack. So if a plus b and b plus c equals c, then a equals c, right? So, um, but that turned out to not actually be true on two counts. Number one, when they just looked at the direct relationship between saturated fat intake and cholesterol intake and heart disease, just taking blood cholesterol completely out of the equation like let's forget about the mechanism. Let's just see if people who eat more fat and cholesterol actually have more heart attacks. When they did those studies, no difference. People who eat more fat and more cholesterol did not have more heart attacks than people who eat less, so that was a huge problem and then more recent studies have found that on average, saturated certainly dietary cholesterol intake has nothing to do with serum cholesterol levels.

Speaker 2:          02:00:41       For the vast majority of people, 70 percent of patients won't see any change in their diet, in their blood cholesterol levels by changing their dietary cholesterol levels one way or the other, and how do you account for the other 30? They're called hyper responders and that may be genetic, so they may have a certain ape geno type that predisposes them to be more susceptible to the effects of dietary cholesterol. They may be hyper absorbers of dietary cholesterol, so they actually absorb more through their gut than a typical person. But even those hyper responders, they found that both their total, their total cholesterol went up, but that was because both the good and bad cholesterol went up at the same time. So the effects were seen as being not clinically relevant because although you saw an increase in the total, it was driven by good going up as well as the bad going up a little bit. So it wasn't thought to be clinically significant.

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       Is it possible that like what we're talking about before longterm studies would reveal more because we were talking about a certain nutrients. When you eliminate them from the diet, it takes a long time to find the effect or what we're talking about with fish oil that maybe if a longterm study showed an increase in dietary cholesterol, you can see negative effects.

Speaker 2:          02:02:01       Yeah. I think long longterm studies could certainly reveal different effects. I think the biggest question here is should we be looking at a blood cholesterol levels as the sole arbiter of whether something is good or or bad for us? You know what I mean? Like let's say someone switches to a nutrient dense low carb diet from that standard american diet, and let's say every single thing about their health improves. They lose weight, they, they, uh, their insulin levels decrease. Their blood sugar levels go down on their blood pressure levels go down, their inflammatory markers go down. By the way, this is not a theoretical thing. This is something I see every day in my practice, but their total cholesterol goes up. Is that a bad thing? Is that a good thing? You know, should, should they go back to the standard american diet eating?

Speaker 3:          02:02:53       I'm sorry to interrupt you, but if you, could you explain what is the difference between bad cholesterol and good cholesterol to the people that.

Speaker 2:          02:02:59       Yeah. So this is a really big over simplification and it was created I think by the drug companies to make it seem very simple. Like, you know, good cholesterol, bad cholesterol, bad, our drug lowers your bad cholesterol. Good. You know that that's how simple they want it to be. It's not actually that simple. So called bad cholesterol actually has some, some important roles that it plays. It wasn't actually just dare to give us heart attacks contrary to that, you know, what that model would assume. Um, and what's even more wrong about referring to a cholesterol is we're not actually what's important is not really how much cholesterol we have. What's important is the lipoproteins. So let me see if I can use an analogy here. So imagine your bloodstream is like a highway and uh, the cars on the highway or the lipoproteins and the passengers in the car are the cholesterol, the lipoproteins carry around the body and a lipoproteins also carry fat soluble vitamins, like vitamin a and vitamin d and triglycerides and other things that, that our body actually needs.

Speaker 2:          02:04:13       So they're like a taxi service that carries cholesterol aNd fats and other nutrients all around the body and takes them to the cells where they're actually used. Okay. So for years it was thought that the amount of cholesterol inside the lipoproteins was the big issue. And that's what's measured when you go and you get a liquid panel and uc, you get your total cholesterol, your ldl and your hdl cholesterol. They're measuring the passengers in the cars, like how much cholesterol is inside of those particles, and that was thought to be the driving factor for risk for heart disease. We now know that it's not really the cholesterol inside of the particles that makes a difference. It's how many particles you have. So to use, come back to this analogy. If you have a highway and you've got a whole bunch of cars on the highway, it's as likely that want more likely when I'm gonna go off the road and crash, right?

Speaker 2:          02:05:07       And they'll crash into the artery, the site, the endothelial wall of the artery, and it'll damage the artery and they. And that's what initiates this whole process of plaque formation that eventually leads to heart disease. So it's literally like volume. It's a gradient driven process. So if you have a high number of particles in the luminal space of the artery, they will try to diffuse across the lumen. So it was an issue with overeating. No. So, uh, so what we're talking about here is the number of particles and all of the things that I talked about earlier that raised cholesterol. What I was actually referring to is things that raise ldl particles. I Just didn't want to go into all of this nuance at the risk of confusing people. So ldl versus hdl. Yeah. So you have ldl particles and you have hdl particles. Ldl stands for low density lipoprotein, hdl for high density lipoprotein.

Speaker 2:          02:06:02       And traditionally ldl particles have been viewed as bad. That's the bad cholesterol. And hdl particles have been viewed as good and there is something, there's definitely something to that. The, um, the single most important risk factor like marker from a, from a blood lipid standpoint are the two most would be l, ldl particle number, and another lipoprotein called lipoprotein little a. So I'm coming back to our analogy. If you have a whole lot of ldl particles are a whole lot of cars on the road, there's more of a chance that one of them's going to damage the artery and then that whole process of plaque formation is going to, is going to occur. And that's what increases the risk of heart disease. So the name of the game is to keep your ldl particle number down. and when we talk about the things that increase it, you know, going back to early in the interview, genetics do play a role.

Speaker 2:          02:07:03       diet definitely plays a role. But then also things like thyroid function, infections, inflammation and leaky gut play a role. So it's not happening in isolation, you know, it's our, it's, once again, we have to look at our whole health, you know, our diet, how we sleep, how we live, whether we have infections or inflammation or guts, guts, stuff going on. And I have many patients, I'm often guys who kind of be their only complaint is that they have high cholesterol and now I don't know if they're not. If they are, they really are 100 percent healthy. And that's the only complaint we test their ldl particle number. It's high. They say they have no gUt issues, they have no fatigue, no, no other health problems at all. But then I test their gut and I do all these testing and we find issues. We address those issues and their ldl particle drops by 30, 40, even 50 percent sometimes. Wow. Which is more than you would expect from a staton. So. So this again, this is another one of those things. It's way more nuanced than it than it's made out to be. And it is true that ldl particles play an important role in the, in how heart disease develops, but this dominant paradigm notion that saturated fat and dietary cholesterol are the main things that influence our ldl particle number is false.

Speaker 3:          02:08:28       My friend anthony bourdain was taking statents cause he, he, he used to eat a lot when still eats a lot and he was developing high blood pressure and you know, the, all the issues that were just outlining, he started training every day doing brazilian jujitsu, like got really obsessed with it. No longer has to take stanton's right. Changed his, changed his cholesterol profile, which is really kind of fascinating. I'm sure he's eating healthier, but to me that's a, that's a, that's, that's a very strange thing. Like what? What is happeNing that's causing his cholesterol to drop because of exercise at 58.

Speaker 2:          02:09:07       Did he lose weight? Lost a lot of ways. Thirty pounds. The fastest way you can normalize your cholesterol profile, a profile in your, your really your ldl particle number, which is even more important and your blood pressure is weight loss, but why is it a contributing factor? It's just there's a whole constellation of metabolic changes that happens when we become overweight that include insulin resistance and leptin resistance of the gut issues. you outlines all the gut issues, inflammation, and this creates like a glue that leads to dyslipidemia, which is this. So each particles, so we talked about this at the cars on the road, a car can only hold so much, so many passengers, right? and if you have a lot of fats, the fats will take up all the space and the cars and you will need more cars to carry a given amount of cholesterol around the body because we need cholesterol for sex hormone production and other things that you mentioned earlier in the show.

Speaker 2:          02:10:11       So if you have a lot of triglyceride, a lot of fat in your liver, the liver will maKe more ldl particles because it needs more particles to carry the amount of cholesterol that needs to get around the body. So that's actually what's happening and that might've been too much detail, but that's why when you're overweight and you have more fat, you actually have a higher ldl particle and when you loSe weight, the converse happens, you, you need fewer particles to transport the same amount of cholesterol, so your ldl particle will go down, your, your, uh, insulin and leptin sensitivity will improve, your gut may improve also, and your blood pressure will typically go down because the heart doesn't need to work as hard to pump as much blood. It makes sense. Um, the, the terminology of

Speaker 3:          02:11:01       bad cholesterol versus good cholesterol is Kind of problematic, isn't it? Because it doesn't ldl play some sort of beneficial roles if you don't want to eliminate ldl?

Speaker 2:          02:11:11       No. I mean, some have argued that it should be zero, but I don't, I don't think that that makes much sense biologically. I'm one role that it plaYs is it's antimicrobial ldl particles are antimicrobial, um, so that if, if toxins do get into the bloodstream, like lip lipopolysaccharide for example, a ldl particles can be, will be manufactured to deal with that, and that's one reason why chronic infections increase ldl particle number because the body is attempting to deal with that infection and the toxins. Um, as I mentioned as well, the ldl particles are like a taxi service that carry nutrients to different parts of the body, fat soluble vitamins and fats liKe triglycerides and antioxidants too that we need to function properly. So I think it's a question of balance. You know, we want to keep our ldl particle and arrange that contributes to health and doesn't increase our risk substantially for

Speaker 3:          02:12:06       disease. Yeah. It's one of those things that it's, it's so over simplified in the way people describe them. That sort of leads people to think, well, I just need to take a stat and almost take a pill and this is the way it's being described to people that have these issues by doctors and these very brief seven minute minute meetings that they're having with their doctors for the next person in line gets in this. It's a really bad system. It's a really bad system that and look where we're having this conversation and I'm a person who obviously I didn't go to school for this and I'm trying to take all this stuff in over a period of years of reading and watching documentaries and talking to people like you and dr rhonda patrick and and you know, so many different people. Rob wolf and so many dIfferent people that are experts in nutrition and the way the body processes nutrients and I'm still baffled by a massive amount of it. Given the many, many, many, many, many hours I've been paying attention to it. You know, it's incredibly complex.

Speaker 2:          02:13:15       So complex. I mean it's liKe any other pursuit. I think the more you know, the last, you know, the more you can just say, you realize that you can spend your lifetime, you know, learning about this and you still have many lifetimes to go before you felt like you really could master it.

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       Yeah. I think dennis mckenna had a great way of describing. I'm learning something and realizing how little you learn. That one, the bonfire of understanding increases. IT illuminates the surface layer of ignorance greater. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:13:45       I love that. Yeah, that's exactly how I feel about this. At the same time, I think our knowledge is advancing and we are in a different place even just 10 years ago than we were 10 years ago. Yes. We understand things. So

Speaker 3:          02:13:59       I think maybe some doctors know, right? Like there's a lot of people that would talk to their doctor and dr. Golf, oh,

Speaker 2:          02:14:04       that's nonsense. Oh, well these guys and these so called experts and they'll go on about it. Here's the interesting thing about that. Number one is that, uh, there's a real lag time between what's in the scientific literature that anyone can access. Now you know, I mean they may not, you may average person doesn't have access to the full text, but anyone could go to pubmed.gov and pull up abstracts from the hundreds of thousands of scientific studies that are published and you will see if you do that. I mean if you're inclined to do that, that they're, you know, the, the vast majority of recent research suggests that saturated dietary, saturated fat and dietary cholesterol are not major risk factors for heart disease. But the time it will take for that knowledge to percolate down to the average primary care provider is not weeks or months or even years.

Speaker 2:          02:15:00       It's probably decades because that's how long it took for the idea that saturated fat and dietary cholesterol are bad for us to get hammered into our heads. I mean, that started in the fifties and it didn't really sink in, I don't think until the eighties or the nineties, you know, with the boneless chicken, skinless chicken breast and the bagels with no butter or cream cheese and the, you know, like that was my generation like that, you know, pasta, carb loading and that whole thing. That was 30 years aFter this whole campaign started. and unfortunately I think it's going to take another couple of decades and hopefully it will go faster this time. And in there are some signs that it is going faster. But the average primary care provider, they're seeing patients 30, 40 hours a week. They have families, they have other, you know, that theIr own health to consider.

Speaker 2:          02:15:51       They're not going home at night and reading the scientific literature. They are trying to take care of their patients, trying to live their own life and they only know what they were taught in medical school, which, you know, unless they're doing continuing education and the medical school tech textbooks are out of date as soon as they're printed. Uh, and they're based on studies that were done 50 or 40 or 50 years ago. So this is a huge problem in medical education is that the current research, you know, the, the public policy and the standard of care is not based on the most recent research and, and the peer reviewed evidence that we available to us now. It's based off and on research that's decades old.

Speaker 3:          02:16:33       This stuff takes so long. The process people have these podcasts and they go over him three or four times and start taking notes and just try to make these changes in their life. If you wanted to give someone advice as to what is the best way to proceed. If someone's listening to this podcast and they say, okay, obviously I really need to know what's going on in my gut. I need to know what'S going on with, uh, my, my, my overall blood lipids, my health. Well yeah, my nutrient density. But what, what, what do, what does the average person to do? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:17:04       So I think the first very first thing is I can set them up in three words, eat real food. And you know, you can talk about paleo, primal, paleo template. Okay, that's bad. You know, I would argue that that's a step above, but just eating real food, like avoiding things that come in a bag or a box, you know, butter comes into box. All right, let's not get too hung up on that. But you know what I mean? When can say that, right? Actual actual real food, vegetables that come out come out of the ground and fruits and nuts and seeds and some, even some tubers, sweet potatoes, I think white potatoes get a bad rap and they're fine for most people as long as they're not, you know, fried and crappy oil and the skins are actually really good for you. Good for you.

Speaker 2:          02:17:47       And you know, eat some, some good pasture raised organic if possible, animal products and wild caught fish. Um, if yOu can do that, and I really think that, that, that would solve 80 percent of people's problems if you're already doing that or you've already got that down and you're still having additional issues. ThIs is where functional medicine comes in, which we've kind of touched on at various points along the way. Um, but this is an, is a relatively new and fast growing branch of medicine that is focused on addressing the underlying cause of illness, you Know, taking the pebble out of the shoe instead of just suppressing symptoms. And there are several training organizations out there. Institute for functional medicine is the, is been around the longest and it's pretty well known. I have kresser institute which just started, we're trAining the 200. We have 200 doctors and other healthcare professionalS in the program now.

Speaker 2:          02:18:44       And you can go to these websites and look for practitioners that practice functional medicine and unfortunately it's not yet at the level where there's one on every corner, like even like a yoga studio. Um, but it's changing fast. And you know, for example, mark hyman, who's a nine time number one New York times bestselling author dot a health expert. He recently was tapped to start the center for functional medicine at the cleveland clinic, which is a very prestigious medical institution and they already have a six month wait list and it's just, it's blowing up. So I think the tide is turning and, and pretty soon a lot of people will be seeing functional medicine practitioners, um, but these are the practitioners that are likely to be knowledgeable about how to properly test your, got, how to assess your hpa access, your stress tolerance and, and, and, um, resilience.

Speaker 2:          02:19:42       How to look at your functional, your blood chemistry panel. So look at your blood sugar, your lipids, your metabolic function, your vitamin d or b, 12 levels. take all of that information and then create a customized individual plan for you based on all of your lab test results, your current symptoms and signs, your health history, your family history, and your lifestyle and put all that together and then make a plan for you. And as you can imagine, that takes time. You know, the, the typical first appointment is more like an hour and a half, then seven minutes. And it's also, uh, can be more expensive because there's a lot of lab work that's done up front to try to figure out what's causing the problems. But I would argue that it's less expensive over the longterm because when you address the root of the problem, the, the treatment is going to be way more effective and it's going to be way longer lasting.

Speaker 3:          02:20:43       And I think I can say from my own personal experience from someone who's changed their diet in eliminated almost all sugar in terms of like added sugar, very, very little. Do I take in a daily basis are eliminated. Almost all simple carbs and my energy levels are so much better. Um, I don't craSh like I used to. I feel like overall my health is better. I talked about my, um, increased over the last few years of probiotics, made a giant benefit, made. It made a huge impact in terms of my ability to recover from illnesses, my ability to avoid on the sis. And I have little kids so my kids are in travel, which I travel in airplanes and just like disease vector labs, you know. But I survived them so much better than a lot of my peers who don't take care of themselves the same way. It just, it makes a big difference in that overall quality of life difference is so significant and it has such an impact on your productivity and your energy levels, your happiness because you're not constantly fighting diseases and illnesses. And that is another thing that people I think ignore or maybe you are not really aware of is the function of your health and your immune system and your gut biome and how it translates into your actual personality.

Speaker 2:          02:22:07       That's a huge point. I'm really glad you brought that up. Um, and it does that in a Couple of different ways. One Is just the actual chemical influence that we talked about, the year gut bacteria, how it influences your brain. Brain chemistry can affect your mood, but the other I think is more, uh, related to just how you experienced your life. When you feel good versus when you feel crappy. like you pointed out, your productivity increases, you're just happier, you have more time to be effective, and you're probably able to be more present with your kids and your, your, if you're in a relationship with your partner. And I mean it's, it's a dramatic difference. I think one of the downsides of how adaptable we are as human beings is we can get used to some pretty heavy stuff and people who, a lot of people I think are sick and they're not, or at least they're not. Well, you know, they're not really healthy and there's a kind of normalization of that. The top that happens in our culture, um, you know, it's just common to that people are taking drugs, people are taking more than one drug. Uh, they're, they're just, they don't feel well, they're not sleeping well. Um, you know, that's common, but I don't think it's normal and there's a really important difference between what's common and what's normal. I think that's an awesome point and I think

Speaker 3:          02:23:33       this has been a great conversation. I really, really thank you for coming in here and thanks for your awesome website. There's so much data and so much information there. A chris kresser.com for people that are interested, there's a ton of articles up there and if if they want to follow any of your other work were. Can you direct them?

Speaker 2:          02:23:50       Yeah. Chris kresser.com is the main place I have a podcast called revolution health radio and itunes and then for any clinicians that are interested in learning more about this approach is kresser institute.com. Thank you chris.

Speaker 3:          02:24:03       Appreciate it, man. This was awesome. I'm going to do this again. Love to take it in folks. Uh, we will be back tomorrow. Who's here tomorrow? Tony hinchcliffe the golden pony. Unhealthy cigarette smoking little fuck he'll be here tomorrow. See ya. Bye. I love you guys.

Speaker 2:          02:24:23       That was great.
