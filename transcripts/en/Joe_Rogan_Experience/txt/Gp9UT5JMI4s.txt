Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches. Just a few people at heard UFC from the old days and the hoist gracie days and the um, the vast majority of the public was kind of out of the loop and then they put it on the ultimate fighter and you know, it was sort of the prime of reality tv back then. And that fight between forrest griffin and Stephan Bonner, which was such a wild ass fight that sort of made mma and we really did it made the UFC and [inaudible] needs something like that. They need would if those two played it safe that night. It's a good point. What would we be here, Joe? It's a good point. Where do we beat y'all? It's a good point. I'd probably be a in Texas right now doing stand up.

Speaker 1:          00:42          I probably would have never worked for the, you probably would have went under. Yeah man. I mean keyboard warriors were telling forrest griffin how sloppy he looked at night and Stephan Bonner was, it showed or whatever the fuck they would say. You know, who does a chode does anybody know? Is that a real thing? You know what they like to call people today? I've known as a cook. I cook a cock. That's a big thing. I said, well, you know what it is. It's like the kids on the Internet have found a new insult. Like cock has only been around for like, yeah, okay. See You k w well it comes from a cuckold, which is like a guy who likes watching his wife get fucked by other men, usually manlier men. And uh, how the term Jolie, I'm online. I frequented the Internet, sir to cut, cut, cut, cold.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Right. Might say, correct me if I'm wrong Jamie, but I believe that's what it's about. You know, who would know, I wish Jim Norton was here. He could explain this to us in its entirety, but there is a whole genre of porn based or ah, around like really nerdy white guys who have like this smoking hot wife that's not satisfied. And some guys like, shut the fuck up and sit down. I'm going to fuck your wife in front of you. Oh No. And they cry. And some of them, they make the, they make the husband's suck their Dick. That happens too. Well, yeah, that's a cook. That's how, you know the husband is suck. His Dick is the cook. They guy that comes in as much of, that guy's a stud guy who comes in and smashes it. But I dunno if she's a stud, if he lets the guy stuck his deck.

Speaker 1:          02:16          That's just weird. Yeah. That's where it goes deep. You know, there's like a spectrum. Even cock porn, keeping cocked, porn has a, there's a lot of variables they have to take into consideration. But I see people calling people cox all the time. Like when you're calling another man to cook as an insult, what does that say about you and the porn that you watched it, you know, that is, that just says you frequent like reddit or something or you're on twitter all the time. I mean, I don't think it says anything about it. I just think it's, it's a new thing to call someone to hurt their feelings. You know, like there's no other, there's no equivalent word. Like, it's a new, it's a new sort of like a classification of someone to call someone a cook and you fucking cook. Yeah. You, well now I'm sorry I have to start calling people that. No, don't do it.

Speaker 2:          03:04          Can we just promoted it to the world? Isn't that kind of thing before and how it's going to be fucking Holy Shit. No, they've been doing it forever. They're going to call people like Hashtag powerful cook.

Speaker 1:          03:15          Oh, you just started something now, man. Just made a big mistake.

Speaker 1:          03:21          You know what? I noticed it a lot when a Kurt Kurt Metzger, Ooh, he's a writer for Amy Schumer show. He's funny. Standup comedian. Very funny guy. And uh, he was one of the writers for Amy Schumer's show when she was getting accused of plagiarism and all this stuff was going on and I was seeing all these people calling them a cock and I was like, what is this? And then I noticed it was like everywhere. People call people cooks. Like everyone's a cook, Cook. It's just a phase. I hope so. There you go. So if someone calls you a cook now, you know, I was like, what am I a chicken? Fuck is that

Speaker 2:          03:52          I don't get it. Cluck. Now I will get it. Oh yeah, the Internet's, I don't know all of my, all the haters. Now we're going to, can we call me a cook?

Speaker 1:          04:01          You think? I don't think it'll work. It doesn't work. If you don't like actually watching your wife get gorilla fuck by some greater, first of all, you got to find a dude. Fuck your wife day. You can't kick his ass. That's not, it's not like a regular Guy Joe Schilling. So this is a different sort of scenario. A real caucus supposed to be like a feeble person who lets, I'm a fucking Lawrence Taylor type dude come into his bedroom and fuck the shit out of his little white wife. Uh, there's a visual for it. Yeah, there you go. That kind of a thing. You know,

Speaker 2:          04:32          let's Tuck won't work. I mean then,

Speaker 1:          04:36          but they'll try it on you anyway. It's, I mean, I wonder if we've run out of insults. I mean it's just cause it's coq one day using it so often. Even when it's not, it's not really applicable. And they're doing it because it's a new one. Like we got a new one just like, it's not like this makes sense. Let me call him a faggot. This makes sense. Let me call him a pussy. No, it's like we've got this world, it's just throwing around until, it's almost like they found a new word and they just throw it and around until it's useless and we're promoting it quicker now. What, just reporters here, Joe Schilling was just talking about the world. You and I are, we're essentially journalists. Yeah. We're current events journalists. We're trying and might, there might be some old folks right now that it may be, uh, you know, not in the same social groups is us.

Speaker 1:          05:24          Maybe they live in Iowa or something like that. And uh, they just trying to dip their toe into the rest of the world. Like what, what are these kids talking about these days? Let me see what a comedian and a kickboxer have to say about the world. And then they find out about Cox and then, uh, you know, their wife later is going through their google search and she finds cock, what the hell is it called? Fuck is a cook. And then she starts looking up cook and she finds Kuk Porn. And then she gets excited and she thinks my house, but I don't want, Oh God, Oh fuck me in front of him. I know when I'm gonna do, I'm gonna set some shit up. And then she, uh, goes on craigslist, find some dude and she thanks. You know, she's fulfilling a fantasy. Try Spice up the relationship and suicide, murder, suicide, murder, suicide probably, right.

Speaker 1:          06:06          Yeah. That's, it's hard to come back from that one. Kenza how far in that far out in the sticks we're talking about what does a deal with Ahmad Ahmad, it's called a model. Got just the kitty thing. Cox and mods cucs a months. Furries I'm starting to cook is not going to catch on. I still don't get it. Still like still good cook, but she just call the Guy Cock your cock sucker fucking nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. You fucking cook. Yeah, they like it. It's a new word. It's exciting news. Let him use it. The people haven't had a new word to call people and so long and they're trying to take away so many of them. It used to be when I was a kid, you can call a kid a Faggot, you know, and now you gay bashing. Yeah. Back then it had nothing to do with being gay, but it's too late.

Speaker 1:          06:51          That's connected to that. It's really hard to use. Retard. It's hard to use. Retard. No today. You know, even though it's not even a classification for mental illness has nothing to do with down syndrome. Like retarded means slow growth, like slow to catch on. It is literally the perfect word to use for retards when someone's a retard, like calling them a retard is a perfect word. Like you would never say that about someone who has a disease or someone who has down syndrome, but if someone's like it wants trump wins, ward people talking over, that's where retired. That's a retard, right? Fucking radar. It's the right word. It's the word. These goddamn language police motherfuckers, they've, they've typed sensitive to sensitive punch of Cox fucking sensitive cucs they've traded debt catch up. Maybe I do like it. It's fucking, we need a new card. I'm happy.

Speaker 1:          07:46          It's horrendous. That actually works in the description. Right. It's weak little bitch that would let some other man fuck his wife. Yes. Same Person. It would be like, oh, don't call him a retard. Exactly. We need to be more sensitive about the way we communicate both they're really trying to do is just control people. It's a trend. It's the pussification. Yes. The goddamn pussification of America. I see something in America that's like the whole world, the whole world fucking pussification of everybody. Oh yeah. Well, and it's also not not being honest about what the fuck's going on. You know, like when something happens, we have to be real sensitive to who we insult post post, like attacks. Like with shit that was going on in Germany where all these women were getting raped during New Year's eve cut because of all these Islamic refugees that they had come in from Syria.

Speaker 1:          08:32          I mean, it's just, that's just the way it is. [inaudible] people are coming from a completely different culture in their culture. Women are much more suppressed. They come over to this country, Germany, where women are Western eyes, they're free and they're wearing skirts and their tits or hanging out and way they're dressed normal and getting attacked, and so what is the fucking mayor of? Was it Berlin? Tell them, stay away from men and dress different, stay an arm's length away from men and dress more conservatively. Like literally this fucking, these people are so sensitive and worried that they're going to hurt someone's feelings or they're going to be called Islamophobic or racist in some way, that they're, they're telling women who've done nothing wrong, that they should dress differently because they've unfortunately let these people in from another culture that think about things differently. Yeah, a bunch of Cox fucking Cox sensitive dazzle, the mayor of Berlin or wherever it was, it was a woman.

Speaker 1:          09:32          Was it Berlin? I remember when the city was, but that's a woman, so it's even more confusing. But boy did she get fucking raked over the coals online. People are getting tired of it. The pendulum swings both ways. You know, it swings towards ultra sensitivity and then people get sick of that and they go, what the fuck? And then they go hard the other way. I think that's one the reasons why trump is the republican nominee. I think Caitlyn Jenner is responsible for a lot of it. I think people saw that and they're like, what the fuck? They just like, what? What are you doing? What do you, what does this 62 year old man now he's a woman, call me kate on the cover of Vanity Fair, going to be naked on the cover of sports illustrated. And then she went like athlete of the year, fuck, get the fuck out of it.

Speaker 1:          10:17          She was a woman of the year. Yeah, woman of the year should a woman for a week. She winds women of the year just shows you men can do everything, including could. When women in the year be this cock. Jamie pulled up the fucking definition. Is this an urban dictionary? What's a better definition? I think that the one you gave, oh, how dare you? A demasculated millennial liberal male who often speaks of white privilege and modern feminism blames white men for all of the world's problems. Hmm. It's the new definition there, but now I like, I like this though. There it goes chat again with the megaphone telling everyone that he's a Vegan. What a cook. Okay. I like that. I liked that a lot. But um, look up cock hold, but cock hold is different. It's a different, uh, short for conservative. What fucking the word cock is most commonly used on twitter to describe anti white males while it was originally formed with the original meaning of Kack Kack hold the use of the word cock does not necessarily denote a sexual connotation.

Speaker 1:          11:23          Wow. It's morphing. The language is evolving before our eyes. Cox do not care about Islamic countries throwing gays off buildings or hanging them as much as the cake Baker who is Christian and weren't served gay wedding customers. Oh, that's interesting. Coxe. Give a free pass to anyone who criticized them for fear of looking racist or homophobic. We'll still have that lady in Germany is a cook. The word originated from white nationalists vocabulary. But he's still widely used by all. Okay. But that, so, but they took cock hold and turned it into this new thing go to. But what does cut the definition for KOC hold? So this has nothing to do with guys' wives getting bang by just to me, it's still real to me. Damn it. I was also like an official definition that I'm like a little dictionary from old English. Oh, it means a man whose wife was unfaithful.

Speaker 1:          12:13          Yeah. Cuckold which is, yeah, yeah. To make a cuckold of, so if you, okay, that's uh, that's how Norton I think described it to me like a man, if you, if your wife is out banging other dudes and you know about it, but you don't say anything, you become a cock hold. But there's also like cock hold porn where it's like I said, the guys there while like sobbing in the corner while his wife gets grilled, fucked. Interesting. The world is evolving. It's beautiful. So it's still open, open season then for use cook anyway you want, because we were really just hit like five definitions. I still have a fucking clue. I mean, yeah. I mean, a bunch of cooks it of cooks. I liked that one definition though. The the, the Vegan, it's gets on the megaphone. It's usually a Vegan who's been a Vegan for like a month to, all right. Those are my favorite fucking Cox. I can cook. Boy, how do you pull out of this and have a normal conversation? Where do we go from here, jo? Where did we go?

Speaker 3:          13:22          Okay. Okay.
