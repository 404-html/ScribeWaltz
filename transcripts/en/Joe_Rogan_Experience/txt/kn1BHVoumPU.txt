Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Dude, I'm so happy to be here.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Dude. I'm so happy you're here. I've been reading your book and it's fucking excellent. You're a really good writer.

Speaker 1:          00:00:06       Thank you so much. I killed myself doing that though. That is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. How long did it take? That two years. Wow. And when I got the deal, I had this delusional idea that it would be like writing 25,000 word essays and this was so wrong. This was so, so, so much harder than anything I'd ever done. Why was it so much harder than writing essays? Well, when you write essays, you are doing like these kinds of short things. It's limited. You have a beginning, a middle and an end. No characters, no dialogue. You know, simple narrative. Where does this man like keeping a plot together over 300 pages and then that plot is your life, which by definition has no plot. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:00:46       Oh, that makes sense. Yeah, it was. It hard to recall all the moments in your life and do them justice

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       so hard. And also for, for this book, because I work as a journalist, I fact checked it as best I could and nothing is more personally painful than fact checking the ends of various friendships and relationships and realizing what a jerk you were at the time.

Speaker 2:          00:01:06       Yeah, I can only imagine. Yeah. I don't want to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:01:10       Like, Oh man, I had a whole victimization narrative. Oh that was quite the quite wrong think.

Speaker 2:          00:01:15       Probably did too. Everybody does. You know everybody, I mean it's, it's, it's really strange when you go back and talk to people that you haven't talked to for a long time and you're like, okay, what is your, and you know, no, all judgments aside. Let's just give me your version of what happened and I'll tell you what I think happened and you know, I call my God, I don't know what the fuck the truth is anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:01:36       Yeah. I have this one thing where there was this one girl, she recalled something and she recalled it one way and then when she realized that it was actually two days later than she thought it was, which made it look like there was an article she had written, which had contradicted it. She kept insisting it hadn't happened. And I was like, man, here's your twitter. Here's my twitter, here's the twitter of the two other people who are at brunch. Here's the email confirming it had happened on this day. And finally she was like, I just give up. I give up, but I don't remember it.

Speaker 2:          00:02:04       Yeah, it's a, it's very strange when people are confronted by that fact too. Yeah. I had a, um, a friend that I'm no longer friends with. It insisted something. And then when my other friend jumped in and said, that's not what happened at all. It is. It was a psychedelic drug talk. I'm trying to avoid beat around the Bush, like I'm on regular radio or something. But, uh, he was insisting that he, uh, got me on this a psychedelic drug the first time in my, my other friend was like, um, no, that was mine. It was my drugs. I was there like, what are you talking about man? And then he just sort of stopped talking to us,

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       just like walked off and it comes back later with a new subject. Well, people love

Speaker 2:          00:02:43       to, you know, they love somehow or another to get glory from the past and lucky somehow or another it didn't. It's one of those things that never works. Sort of like name dropping, like name dropping has never worked ever. No one has ever said, I'm really good friends with Leonardo Dicaprio. And someone's gone, Whoa,

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       let me give you a movie now. Fucking amazing. No, immediately people go, oh, this guy's a name dropper. You know? Or he just happens to say it. It happens to be true. There's a fine line, but everybody knows what the difference is. Like when you're a name dropper comes, he can, you could smell it in a sentence, you know, it's just like, it comes off in the air. So this book is, um, it's, it's fucking super intimate. Like you, you like just, just cut the skin away and open your chest up and just the whole world could see your soul. You know, you, you peeled it out. I tried my best. I mean I just wanted to do something honest. You know what? It's definitely that I guess. I mean, I don't know. I wasn't there obviously. Um, two years is a long time to write something.

Speaker 3:          00:03:45       Like did you, how many times did you have to go back over it and oh God, like seven drafts and there's a hundred pages of cuts from this book too. That's in another word file that I might nine seven day for other essays. But it was like over and over and you know, because I had never written a book before, I didn't, I didn't realize, you know, how much extra you right. I feel like I was like building a block of marble basically out of words. And then I had to like cut away at the horrible ugly block of Marble I had made. And then finally something cool emerged. Yeah. They all say that all the great writers say that like my friend Steve or always use this quote, you have to kill your babies. Yeah, exactly. That's what they say, right? That's like the common writers conversation.

Speaker 3:          00:04:27       Kill your babies, but then you can keep your babies at another document and you can devote like one essay probaby where they make sense. That sounds similar to stand up comedy and a lot of ways like one of the hardest things about comedy isn't recognizing like I'm a bit, sometimes it's just too fat, there's too much stuff in it and you have to figure out what to chop off. But you have like these emotional connections to these punchlines like upon, I love this part, I love saying it. This is like my favorite part, but that favorite part doesn't necessarily enhance the whole thing. So you have to kind of chip it away and then the whole thing will be better without it. But it's, it's hard to do. Right. Oh God. I mean, the best piece I ever, I've advice I ever got when I started writing was um, my friend Laurie, who's that really cool journalist said to me, the worst articles I've ever written are the ones where I tried to say everything about a subject.

Speaker 3:          00:05:15       That makes sense. Yeah. Well you, your, your style is really interesting too because one of the things that was really cool, it's like you've got a lot of illustrations that go along with these stories. Now are these illustrations that you added in after the fact or the illustrations that you sort of drew while you were experiencing these things? A few of them I drew at the time. Like there are some old illustrations like from Turkey or from Paris that I did when I was teenager. Some stuff from occupied, but I'd say like over a hundred of them I did new for the book. Oh Wow. So that's a lot of extra work on top of that as well. Oh my God. How many days would you doing this every day? Or how will you find the time? Cause I know you're so busy doing journalism, you'd be busy doing

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       art. Like how'd you find the time to do this?

Speaker 1:          00:06:01       Um, I was a really horrible person to be around for quite a few months. Uh, I have the coolest boyfriend in the world. Thank you fred for putting up with me during this fred, Fred. Fred is, Fred is awesome. I, I had a few things. First, I had friends with a house in the country and they let me stay there for a number of weeks and they didn't have internet signal and a lot of it. So I, I didn't bring any of my fun books that I liked to read. So I was just stuck. It was just me in this fucking thing and we're going to beat each other. I rented a lot of hotel rooms. I had an an editor put a beat down on me and was like, you can't keep going off to other countries. You actually have to write this book that I contracted you for eye. And at one point he was like, are you fleeing towards zone? So you don't have to look at your book contract. Is that how it's going? I just, I think towards the end I didn't do anything but work on it. I just became this horrible like troll beast that didn't wash her hair and would growl at anyone who came near living entirely in coffee and just made it. That was how I did it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:07:01       That is a good way to do it. Right? If you can get somewhere without the internet. Yeah. I used to write a lot on airplanes. I so look forward to airplane flights. I'd be like, okay, I'm stuck in this seat. There's no Internet access. And then what the fuck do the airlines do? They put it

Speaker 4:          00:07:14       inner on the God damn planes. I know, right? And then you're like, oh, I need to see what someone says about me on twitter. Oh no, someone was wrong on twitter. I must remedy that.

Speaker 2:          00:07:23       Go on Amazon and buy a new pair of sneakers, you know? Exactly. It's so easy to just get distracted nowadays. It's just the world is becoming more and more available, you know? And if you're off in a cabin in the woods with no Internet access,

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       yeah. Your, your, your stock. You're, you're confronted with your own work to do.

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       Yeah. It's so attractive. That's such an attractive idea. It'd be off in a cab. It's so romantic, right. To be off in a cabin in the woods by herself working on your, your great work.

Speaker 1:          00:07:52       Except whenever I'm actually there, I want to like dig holes.

Speaker 4:          00:07:55       It was in my arms because I'm like, no,

Speaker 2:          00:07:59       there is a guy that I tweeted about today. Uh, there was an article that I tweeted where this guy decided he wanted to live by himself in the, uh, I think it was a northwest territory's who's going to do it for a solid year and, but he made it six months and then he had a satellite phone. It's like, come get me, I can't fucking do this anymore. But he was just going crazy like by himself for six months and it's a, it's a fascinating story. This is the guy right here. Norwegian adventurer spent six months alone in the north territory. Holderness and uh, it's really cool because the guy is, he is very good at describing like what he felt and what it was like and what he expected versus what it was really like. One of the things that he said that I thought was really interesting, he said, we are not meant to be alone and I kind of feel that way too. I feel like I, you know, people romanticize this idea of being this hermit. It's off in the woods, you know, the, the, the monk that's out meditating in the forest by himself, that shit is

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       like, it's like holding your breath. It's kind of cool for a little while, but you don't, you don't want to do it very long.

Speaker 1:          00:09:02       No, man, I think, I mean, it makes you go crazy. Like being in solitary things makes you go crazy. I recently did a really big investigative piece. I'm on some longterm solitary prisoners and these guys like were really smart guys. They were, you know, really, um, strong guys in my opinion. Like one of them, I consider them really a genius, but he had been in solitary for 14 years. Man. 14 years. And um, who is this? His name is Andre Jacobs. He, I was part of these group of whistleblowers called the Dallas six that, um, basically they were giving information about guards doing, I'm beating people up and being racist in this prison in PA and they're all in solitary and the guards retaliated. And then when one of the other guys, Carrington sued the Dea for, I'm not protecting him from the guards, the da turned around and charged them all with rioting.

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       And I got really into the case cause I was like, this seems semantically interesting. How do you ride if you're in solitary? I consider riding at group activity. Like if someone's riding in solitary, he could just leave them there and they get tired eventually and then the right would be over. You know, that's hilarious. He called it rioting. So there, so I uh, I did an investigative piece and eventually I got like video and stuff but, and it was bullshit and I really hope they're trial goes well in February, but as part of it, you know, he spent a lot of time talking to um, two of the guys and I mean you sat for real mental trauma from doing that and like, no one, even like the smartest, toughest, best person who has like a really loving mom that is really devoted to giving them, you know, all the books and all the support, even that person will suffer like real, real trauma from that.

Speaker 5:          00:10:44       Yeah. I've always wondered like when Bradley Manning was arrested and then later became Chelsea manning and spent how many years was he? She, you know, whenever the transition makes sense. Uh, how many years was she in solitary? Like cool. Like it was quite a long time and three years I think. Naked. Yeah. Naked and in cold conditions, like they literally tortured her, like take tortured her. Like they, what they decided when do you, when do you say her and when his him, cause when did she decide to transition? When she was in there. Right. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:20       See, like announce the transition, um, right after her trial. But she, um, I mean if you look at her chat logs with Adrian Lamo, she has one line where she says that what she's afraid of is being known to the world as a boy. So I think, I think she decided herself along a long time ago, but before she was arrested, yeah. Before she was arrested, but that she just didn't publicly announce it for a long time. That is a crazy, the worst things to be known as a boy. Yeah. Whoa. Yeah. It was a, it was a line from the chat log. And anyone who's listening to this, like, please fact check it. I don't want to get it wrong, but that's what I remember. But I remember thinking

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       like, who wouldn't lose their fucking mind being naked in a room by herself for years? Like what did they, they thought that she was a, um, a hazard to ourself or something.

Speaker 1:          00:12:05       They're, they're, they're bullshit excuses where he's like, oh, you're a suicide risk so we have to have you naked with no glasses, nothing to read, a horrible like suicide prevention blanket that you can't like, you know, wrap around you and just, we have to like torture here cause he might be a suicide risk. Like is she in like regular prison now or still in solitary? She's in regular prison right now actually like one of my most cherished possessions in the university. She wrote me a letter once cause I, I drew a birthday card for her. She dots her i's with little doves. It's really cute with doves. Yeah. She draws little doves on them. Every I, yeah. I hope this isn't a long letter now as a short one. Is that it was a gracious one. It wasn't me. It was, I think it, it reminded me of like, you know, the thank you card that like someone very graciously, right. Someone who's giving them a gift.

Speaker 2:          00:12:51       But what a bizarre set of circumstances. Someone who was a soldier who transition to becoming a woman and then sends letters at all, have the, the animal that's known as the symbol of peace. Yeah. Over all the eyes.

Speaker 1:          00:13:04       I mean, I think from her life you get the sense that part of the reason she wants to join the army, but she's just like so smart and she just wanted to go to college. I mean, I'm, from what I know kind of about reading her life story like this, this was someone who like her happiest time was like dating a dude who is around sort of like the mit hacker scene. And I think that if she was middle class and not poor, she just would have like gone to school and gotten a computer science degree and that would have been the whole thing. It's incredible that someone who exposes crimes

Speaker 2:          00:13:34       and that's uh, that's the only way you could look at what happened with Edward Snowden end with Bradley Manning. I mean, you could say that they did, what they did was treasonous you get isn't really treasonous when you're exposing crime. Like, isn't it supposed to be illegal to commit crime? And if your government is doing things that are illegal, isn't it your job as a patriot to expose those things? Like when do you, when is it not treasonous?

Speaker 1:          00:13:56       Oh God, yeah. I mean they're, both of them are heroes. Um, if no one is putting their own government in check, then that government will just tend to concentrating more and more power and people in it will concentrate to doing worse and worse things cause there's no sort of supervision and there's no way that you can love your country and I'll call it on. It's bullshit at all. I think that the opposite thing is treason. I think it's treason to say like, just because it's my country, any crime is justified

Speaker 2:          00:14:23       with a, what they're doing though is so horrible because they're making it so that no one ever does anything like this. Again, it's so they make such a giant example. Like Julian assange is literally like going crazy. The staying in that one house in, in London, he can't leave if he leaves the arrest him the moment he steps foot on that. Like what a crazy thing. Like he can get out in the balcony and wave to people and get a slight amount of vitamin D and then he has to go back inside and he's fucking trapped.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       Snowden is hanging out with Putin and Russia, which is just bizarre to me. So strange. I watched a bizarre Putin video today. Which food and video did he watch? Hooten they're analyzing his gait the way he walks. So creepy. Like why don't they just admit that they like have a crush on him and one have a sleep over? That is so weird. I mean, well it's because he has a very specific way of walking that's indicative of someone who has military training. It's called the gunslingers gate as I did. Did they make that term up themselves? I guess they probably did, but what he does is he swings his left arm but not his right, so he could pull his gun out really quickly. That's the idea. But what's really bizarre about the video is I didn't know how like opulent wherever he is, what palace or whatever the fuck it is.

Speaker 3:          00:15:41       Like they have these fucking ignore it. Like here it is, look at these. He norm is gold doors. Like let's play it. Let's play at Jamie. So he could watch this. Like if you watch as he walks, if you notice his left arm swings noticeably while his right arm stays relatively still in comparison, like a huge contrast. And he always does this and that's so that he could shoot you in the fucking head quicker. I think I got someone finds out there's an untreated rotator cuff injury and one of the that's true, right? We're just like looking way too into it. But apparently it's really common amongst these guys in the Russian military that, uh, get that move to some form of political power. But what's kind of creepy? It's about it. Backing up to the beginning again, Jamie, please. Um, what's creepy it's about is look at those fucking doors.

Speaker 3:          00:16:33       Like what is that like? What are those God damn doors. Look at all that gold. Everything's gold. I mean, I guess that's the vestiges of being an imperial power where people used to collect faberge eggs and he is, I mean, he is one of the most open dictators that you can see in modern society in which it's supposed to be some sort of a democracy. I'm not entirely familiar with how the Russians run their political system, but I know that he was out and then he was, you know, he puts some other guy and some sort of a puppet position and now he's back running the whole show. But it's, it's, he's a weird case man. I don't know how he manages it. It seems like guys like that someone always wants to kill them and just, it always falls apart. But he's managed to keep it together for a long, long, long time.

Speaker 3:          00:17:25       Now. He is, I mean, I can't say, I'm like super familiar with Russian politics, so I could, I might be talking bullshit, but I mean, he, you know, he was the ex head of the KGB. Like he seems incredibly versed and spying on people and killing people who are threats and maintaining his position at all costs. Yeah. He doesn't just kill him. He kills him like openly. Yeah. Hasn't gotten down in front of their girlfriends and stuff like that. He's just, it's just it massive terror tactic. Who was that one guy that was, yeah, he was walking with his girlfriend and his thought was that he had become so famous from criticizing and the Putin couldn't kill him because if he did it would be so obvious. Nope. No, he doesn't care. I mean, I always think about, um, there is a very respected, a journalist whose name, last name I won't pronounce cause I'll, I'll butcher it.

Speaker 3:          00:18:12       But um, yeah, she was also just like gunned down for criticizing him. Yeah. Well that's kind of happened sort or fear for theoretically at least in other places. But one on one of the weird ones in America was that Michael Hastings Guy, that guy. That's a, that's still, that one really freaks me out to this day. Cause if you don't know the story, Michael Hastings was, there's actually a ted talk, um, that's available right now. It's, I'm a podcast called the Ted Radio Hour, which I listened to all the time that had, um, one episode called disruptive leadership, but it actually focused on this general general mcallister. And they were kind of sympathetic to him in this, in this Ted talk because, uh, the idea was that he did a real leadership thing by stepping down and what, what it was was Michael Hastings had gotten embedded in this military organization, whether they were overseas and when the volcano erupted, remember that volcano in Iceland, it erupted and it's fucked up all the flights out of Europe and a, you couldn't fly from that part of the world to this part of the world.

Speaker 3:          00:19:24       So, uh, he got stuck. It was supposed to be a short trip and he got stuck over there for a month. And as he got closer and closer to these people, they've got more and more relaxed and they started telling jokes that were inappropriate about like Al Gore and, or Joseph Biden. And, um, along the lines of this, this Guy Michael Hastings formulated this article, published it in rolling stone and um, it became this sort of a national scandal and I believe his name is Miguel Esta right? Is that his name? He, um, he was forced to step down and that's what the whole focus of this ted radio hour was about was this guy, um, taking a leadership position, a leadership point of view by deciding that his position was not as important as the cause itself. And he was just going to step down because he had created this environment where it was too much controversy and he was upset that, um, President Obama didn't ask him to stay, but it is what it is and that's it. But what they don't say in this thing was just Michael Hastings guy who was in this recording, who's talking about what it was like when he was there and he committed suicide in one of the strangest, most controversial ways ever. I don't think it was a suicide. I think it was an accident. Well, some people think it was a suicide. Some people think it was an accident and that the black helicopter crew thinks that he

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       was murdered and that what they did is they took over the electronics in his Mercedes and they forced his car to drive right into a tree at 120 miles an hour with no brakes and explode. And let me, there's all this crazy, all these crazy conspiracy theories that are attached to it that say that engines don't go flying from a car like that unless there's a bomb involved. And you know, like, why would this guy do this? And it is pretty, pretty trippy stuff. And then there was claims that there was crystal meth in his system and then he was, you know, high on drugs and he had a problem with drugs in the past. But then the counter to that was people were like, well, no, he's probably doing adderall, which a lot of writers do.

Speaker 1:          00:21:29       Yeah, right. Yeah. It's like the New York drug. Everyone's on adderall in New York, is it? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, I know a lot of people who were very close to, to Michael Hastings and, um, I will say that people that I know that are very close to him think it was a tragic accident.

Speaker 2:          00:21:44       They just happened to be going 120 miles an hour on sunset boulevard.

Speaker 1:          00:21:48       Yeah. I mean that's, that's, that's for the people I know that, you know, he never hit his brakes. I, I can't, I can't debate it. But that's, that's just what I've heard from people, from people who I'm very close to who are close to him. I would say that too,

Speaker 2:          00:22:00       if I was close to that dude, I knew I was on some sort of a list. If you're close to that guy, you know, you gotta be on a list.

Speaker 1:          00:22:07       Oh my God. Well, I mean, probably like if you're an investigative journalist doing a lot of stuff in Iraq and Somalia, you're probably on the list. You're talking about yourself. Uh, I haven't done Somalia stuff. Um, no, I mean, but like a lot of his friends were investigative journalists mean. Yeah, I'm sure everybody's, I'm a, I'm probably on the list, probably analyst for having you right here. Dude. I know you dude. I'm in California. I don't know. I'm, I'm adopting adopting the a in the native dialect. I, I'm sure we're all on lists because how could you be interesting if you're not on the list? That's true.

Speaker 2:          00:22:36       It's sort of like a badge of courage to be on some sort of a list. Depends on what lists though, you know. But uh, yeah, it's a weird world we live in right now. I think it's a, it's, there's a temporary bridge right now. Let's go on, on where, where there, it's the NSA, you know, fill in the blank with whatever name of whatever organization that's supposedly watching over us. But they have a certain amount of power to look into people that we don't have yet that's temporary. It is going to come a time where this electronic barrier that we have in between each other, it's all going to dissolve and everyone's going to have the same sort of power to spy on everybody at the NSA has. And we're just going to have to accept it. It's going to be very straight. It's going to be like we're all camping. Oh okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:20       God's going to horrifying worlds. We already know too much about each other. We

Speaker 2:          00:23:24       do. Right. Was that a concern when you were writing this book cause you empty yourself out in this book. I mean you talk about sexual liaisons and you know, relationships and friendships and things gone wrong and was, did you, when you were writing this, did you ever say, man, I mean maybe I don't want everybody didn't know these things.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       I had a few things that were like that usually with actually with friendships, but ultimately I thought that it was more important to be honest though, the one thing that I did do was I felt like it would have been really unfair if I had taken kind of, you know, personal moments I had with someone like 15 years ago and just like put them in a book and that's on that person's google result without asking them. So while I tried to be pretty merciless with myself, with people who I'm still friends with, I got their approval on what I wrote about them. Oh, that's really cool. That's it. That's really important. That's it. That would be a real good way to destroy a friendship who started telling crazy, intimate stories about someone just not cool. Like it's not, it's not fair. You know? So, and I know that light, a lot of people disagree with that and they're like, they're my memories.

Speaker 1:          00:24:32       But I don't know. I don't think it's right. Especially if you're kind of the more famous one. It not cool. Yeah, we'll sing there. My memories. But if you share a moment with someone, I think it's kind of a group memory or at least a group moment. Yeah. It's kind of kind of collectively owned. And I, I ran them by my parents also. Dad's gotta be weird. That was the most terrifying thing. And there is the, cause I ran the parts about my parents buy them, but then they hadn't read the whole book. And I had this really terrifying thing when the book came out where I was like, oh my God, what are they going to think? I mean, I love my parents. I have really supportive relationship. I couldn't ask for like two cooler people on Earth unit knew my parents. But still you're always scared, right?

Speaker 1:          00:25:15       It's, it's scary to show yourself like that but, but they liked it. They liked it mostly. So I'm very happy about that. While you must have really open minded parents. My Mama, she used to be an illustrator and now she's mostly retired. She works kind of as a babysitter slash cats that are now and um, my dad and my dad's an academic. Oh that's cool. Well, so yeah, you seem obviously have some intelligent open minded parents so they've got to be really proud of you cause this is excellent stuff. Thank you so much. Yeah, they really are. And um, it was cool because I got to talk about how both of them influenced me so much in there. Totally, totally different ways. Like my mom is an amazing artist. She, she trusts so beautifully and she draws kind of like me. If I was a less bitter and jagged person like, like she drives like the sweet me and I was able to say like, this is how my mom taught me how to draw.

Speaker 1:          00:26:06       You know, this is how she inspired me. You've got some great people that are reviewed this too, man. You got Matt Taibbi to review this. Patton Oswald reviewed this. I mean this is really fucking impressive stuff. Thank you. And that, that's awesome. He actually interviewed me for my book launch in New York and I grew up reading that, you know, I was reading like the exile when I was 18 and I, I love his stuff in New York press. And what I love about Matt's work is that a lot of journalists like, they're like these really like narrow professional people that are very, very serious. And Matt was like this total wild man and he was yelling and now he does this incredible investigative journalism on finance and politics, but he still writes like a real person. He still writes and that kind of hunter s Thompson tone. That's exactly,

Speaker 5:          00:26:51       I was going to describe it like a lucid hunters Thompson. Exactly. Like this drug addled

Speaker 1:          00:26:57       yeah, yeah. Best of hunter s Thompson and less narcissistic bit and we know much less narcissistic now, but it was so influential on me cause I was like, wow, you can totally be this bad ass investigative journalist and you could also be this guy who when he was young was having these crazies often criminal adventures in like the aftermath of the Soviet Union falling. Those two things weren't nodding compatible at all. I, I always liked people like that who have lives that are really, really diverse.

Speaker 5:          00:27:23       Yeah, that's a really good way of describing him too because we do have this idea that if you're going to be an investigative journalist that your piece has to be sort of homogenized and that is going to the, the facts take precedent over the flavor of the pros and his has a lot of flavor. There's a lot of, there's a lot of personality in distributing those facts, but it doesn't get in the way of the facts.

Speaker 1:          00:27:46       Oh God, no, no, he's, it's, it's such like a master class on how to do it. And in fact it's really serves the facts. Cause especially when he's writing about financial journalism, I mean, finance can be so boring and so complicated that it can really be over most people's heads. And if you write it completely without flavor, most people will never even be able to sink into it at all. Yeah. Is

Speaker 5:          00:28:07       Guy that I got most of my information about the financial collapse about, and one of the things that disturbed me the most was how little reaction like publicly his articles caused. Like I thought like it would be one of those things where everyone would be sharing it. It would go, it would be on the front page of the New York Times today on CNN, Matt Taibbi uncover. And everybody would be like, Ooh, look at the facts. This is crazy. But meanwhile it was like this terrible, terrible scenario where the whole system was hijacked by these fucking criminals and no one seemed to care. It just w I have bills to pay, I have to keep going. I have a spin class at nine o'clock I can't be paying and no one, no one really gave it the attention or I shouldn't say no one but not publicly nationally. It didn't get nearly the attention that it deserves and he wrote a series of them and you know, some of them I was like, this guy's going to get fucking killed. Like these were, these were intense allegations and it's it and backed up. All of it backed up by facts and really well written and it's just like almost like it's too much for people. This is like,

Speaker 1:          00:29:19       it's like complicated. It deals with a lot of things that are kind of boring, very intellectually demanding, not necessarily partisan. And I think for a lot of people are like, what are you going to do?

Speaker 5:          00:29:30       Yeah, it bothers me that he's not more famous. That bothers me.

Speaker 1:          00:29:35       I think. I hope with the next book he will be, cause I think he's like one of the best journalists working in American.

Speaker 5:          00:29:41       Yeah, I agree. I agree. He's, he's amazing. He's amazing. Now you, how much time do you spend doing all this? You too. A lot of journalism and you do a lot of crazy shit. You go to a really nutty sort of dangerous places. I've been to a few. Yeah. What is like the most disturbing place that you've been to?

Speaker 1:          00:29:59       Dangerous place I went to was last summer when I went into Syria for a day. And that was, um, basically the reason why when I talk about how dangerous it was, the fact that I wouldn't even spend the night there shows probably something about my tolerance levels. But at that time, this coalition of Islamist groups had just kicked isis out of this border town called is Oz. And you could take a bus over to the Turkish border and then you could cross. And I did that with a war journalist friend of mine and I spent a day with the Islamic Front driving around his eyes. And one of the things, um, that was happening then was it was before, uh, James Foley was murdered, but we all knew that there were lots and lots of kidnappings there. And at that point we thought it was just for ransom and stuff, but still, you know, it's Kinda brings a terrible, terrible thing.

Speaker 1:          00:30:52       And when, um, the scariest thing that ever happened to me as a journalist was we're with these three, a young media activist slash fighter guys, really cool dudes. I mean, I liked them and we're in this car, we're driving around his eyes and the car slows to a halt. It just breaks down. And Patrick, the guy I'm with and immediately thinks it's set up for kidnapping to, you know, get, get us out of the car because that's one way that you can set things up for kidnappings. And the guys didn't have their guns. And so we had to walk to the media office, um, through his eyes and his eyes at that point looked like something out of Mad Max. Like it was just no women on the street, just men. A lot of Ak is, uh, even if a guy didn't have any k like they'd be holding like sticks and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:31:39       Um, they are, were, well there was a like what I can only describe as like a gun bodega, which is fascinating because it's sold all these different guns. Like it might sound like a beautiful antique, you know, Pearl in laid revolver that like someone's dad had, but then also grenades and stuff and grenades. Grenades. Yeah. Because you know, in case someone tried to kidnap you, you could have it grab a fucking, you come with me bitch. Yeah. Basically. Basically. Yeah. So, you know, we're walking through this town and um, that was I'd think the scariest thing that I ever did in my life. But it all turned out fine. And we got to the media office, which it was a government building that they, that these young men had taken over when they kicked out the central government. And I'm the director of it had been kidnapped by Isis and the young guys are there like watching, watching soccer cause everyone, everyone loves soccer there. And it was just, I don't know, it's like this feeling of being in place where, um,

Speaker 1:          00:32:43       the whole world is both fucking with it and abandoned it both at once, you know, and, um, and anything could happen. So that was the most dangerous thing I've ever done. Like nothing I've ever done was as dangerous as going to Syria. But I think the most dot personally disturbing thing was, um, I was in Gaza six months ago, I guess. And I went to shy IA, which is this neighborhood that was completely destroyed by Israel during protective edge. Like they bombed it and then they went in with tanks and then they went in with bulldozers. Like, so it's like flattened and it's just like gone. Like, you know, you, you go there and you're like, this is, this is a neighborhood that has been wrecked. And a lot of times when you see houses that have collapsed, you can see all of the stuff of people's lives and it like, you're like, oh, there's the cooking pots and there's the bed and there's all the stuff that's just trapped in.

Speaker 1:          00:33:34       And then people, because there's a big housing shortage obviously in Gaza, we're living in these bombed out buildings, you know, where their home was. And um, you know, with like no real like services or anything. Like I saw this, I was walking, it was kind of scrambling through this like building take pictures and then I just randomly walked into what I thought was an abandoned room and there's like an old guy there, you know, hanging out and you know, I was like, I'm really sorry to do, you know, invade, invade your home. And I was just just talking to him. But yeah, he had had like a, a baller gorgeous home before this and now he was just living in a little like the rack of one of the rooms.

Speaker 5:          00:34:14       Wow. Wow. It's, you know, the Mad Max is the way you described that, that city and that sort of apocalyptic scenario, something that we all worry could happen to us, to anything. But one of the things that I always try to remember is that the apocalypse is already here. It's just not here. Yeah. If you go there, it's there. Like in Gaza, it's there, that's the apocalypse. It's there. I mean it might as well be in that guy's house. I mean you are living like Mad Max, those people in that, what's the name of the city yet? I saw as, as, as and as Oz mean daddy is what everyone's terrified of. What everyone's terrified of is a reality where you walked on the street and everyone's carrying military weapons and you're just, it's chaos and there's, it's fairly lawless.

Speaker 1:          00:35:06       Yeah. I mean a lot of the refugee camps that I saw it, it's not that they were lawless. I would never describe them as that, but just in the sense of the extreme of falling in your life situation. There is a guy I met when I was in Iraqi Kurdistan. Uh, last time I was with Dr Borders there and he, you know, he was this like super smart dude. Like he was Kurdish, which meant that he was really discriminated against, but he scored so high on his math exams. He was able to go to like an elite engineering school and get an aeronautics degree. And know be, he's never not extend engineer. And like, this is a dude that would, you know, be beyond the path to like having an awesome job. And now like he's living in a tent with his whole family and his mom and everything. And you know, you'd never expect that when you're living in like an awesome city like Aleppo that he was living in. And then you're, and then the war comes and there's bombings and here you're driven out of your home and you're so displaced that eventually you're forced to, you know, be living in this tent with no end in sight and you're not allowed to like ever improve your circumstances because you have the wrong passport. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 5:          00:36:13       It's hard for anybody living in America to wrap their head around what it would be like to be there and be stuck in that position.

Speaker 1:          00:36:20       It really is. I mean, so the Syrian refugee, mm. Um, the Syrian refugee thing, one thing that I, I think perhaps isn't in the media enough is that the people who are coming to Europe right now, or the middle class of the country, because it's cost over a thousand dollars to pay it, to pay that pass smuggler to take you over. And every single one of those people could buy a plane ticket and travel like a normal person and not have their kids risk drowning and all of that. But they're banned from it cause they're Syrians. And the whole like taking the boat and walking from Greece to Germany and having volunteers give out water and sleeping on the streets and like the whole humanitarian disaster is just a function of not letting them buy plane tickets. That all, that's all it is.

Speaker 5:          00:37:05       Well, there's this big push in America now, especially among the Republicans not allow anyone from Syria to come into the United States.

Speaker 1:          00:37:13       It's crazy. Like not a single person with the Syrian refugee program has ever been arrested for terrorism offense. It's, it's like it's nuts. It's, it's solar brown, but they're so scary. They're terrorist. Oh my God. It's like one of them that's an asshole. I'm sure. I'm sure there's assholes, but not one of them was arrested for terrorism offenses.

Speaker 5:          00:37:31       If you look like a million Canadians and you're going to, and they're the nicest people ever,

Speaker 1:          00:37:35       there'd be like some of those guys that are in that, that big like ride was in Toronto. It's washing cars. Yeah. One of the ones size asking a car

Speaker 5:          00:37:41       or one of them from the Vancouver. A hockey riot. Yeah. Those assholes would make it through.

Speaker 1:          00:37:46       No, it's, it's crazy. And it's, um, it's really like personally upsetting to me because I've done so much, you know, work with Syrians over the last few years and like to see these like amazing people that I know who are so tough and so smart and have endured so much. Like being defamed like this, it's, I feel almost like someone's shit talking like my, like my, well, someone that's shit talking my friends, you know, it, it makes me angry on, um, a personal level, like not just a theoretical one.

Speaker 5:          00:38:13       Well, it's not just, it's, it's so short sighted because if you consider the fact that you're, you're talking about an entire group of people that's fleeing a terrible area. Exactly what you're saying. Well, they have all got to be bad. That that's one of the most racist things that you could ever say publicly in 2015 it gets sort of this weird excepted racism. And because of the fact that terrorism, it, like when you're dealing with Muslims, right? You're dealing with 1.6 is that what it is? Billion people, like a fifth of the world. And so the idea is saying, well, lead terrorist activities been, they have been done by Muslims. Why don't we kick all the white people out of America? Because white people have been responsible for all the mass shootings. I mean, that's more logical than this. It's so awful. And like the other thing that's to me like particularly like Moronic is I see some times in the media like, why aren't the Muslims condemning the terrorists?

Speaker 5:          00:39:11       Every single group that is actually on the ground, like fighting isis with guns. You know, they're Muslims. Yeah, yeah. They're like 90% Muslim or 95% Muslim. I mean a lot of them are war criminals too. I'm not saying they're good groups necessarily, but they're Muslim. Um, every single, like major Muslim religious leader in the world has condemned isis in terms that they wouldn't even use an America. I mean, it's astounding to me. I think that the only reason anyone would think that Muslims are and condemning isis is because they can't use google. Don't read the news and have never spoken to a Muslim or for the same reason why Matt Taibbi abies articles never really got as popular as I thought they should. People just don't have the time or the need. Everything is wonderful. You go to the supermarket, you buy food, it's really easy.

Speaker 5:          00:39:55       You know, go through the Mcdonald's, drive through your stomach's full. You sit home and watch netflix. You're good. Like you don't need to pay attention to Syria. Fuck those people. Keep them out. Donald Trump's going to keep us safe and you got to drink yourself into a coma. Wake up in the morning, do it all over again. Drink some coffee, get out the door, get your fucking car, do the same shit. As long as you can get to work. I got bills. As long as you can get to work, you're fine. It's just the idea of America in the first place was supposed to be a place where people could go or they didn't like where they were and they wanted a found, they wanted to establish a new life. They want it to, we're going to take a giant chance. We're going to get an a fucking stupid boat and make it across this giant body of water.

Speaker 5:          00:40:39       We don't even know what it looks like. They didn't have photos back then. That's one of the weirdest things about traveling to America. If you really stop and think about it, it was done when people didn't even have photographs. The first people that came over, if you wanted a picture of something, you had to fucking draw it right. And that's how crazy these people where they're like, I don't care. I saw drawing. It's a pretty trees. We're fucking getting in the boat. But they brought their babies and the grandma and shit and they got in a boat and they came to America because they had an idea and then idea was there is a better life here we can, we can make it and the to deny that to these people because they were born in the wrong patch of dirt. And I'm not saying they shouldn't be checked. You shouldn't go through a criminal background check and make sure you're not letting in some mass murderer or not letting in some rapist or some thieves or whatever. Yeah. I mean if there's a way to do that, that should be done. But the idea that you should never let anybody in that's from Syria. It's like God man, imagine you're cursed. You just cause you were born in the the shitty patch of dirt.

Speaker 1:          00:41:42       That's it. Yeah, that's exactly what the thinking is. It's like because you were born here like oh you carry some virus, you have to be quarantined. Didn't man. I'm like, I'm so, I'm so fucking grateful that you're saying this is like, Gee, your audience and with like on the massive platform you have. Like I, I know it sounds sappy and shit, but like, thank you. I really, yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:41:57       Well listen, thank you for going over there. If it wasn't for people like you and, and you know the, the vice people and all these journalists and all these people that go over there and show us in, in video form, like exactly what's happening. And you get to watch it and see what it's like. They go, oh, this is fucking chaos. Like this is in the world right now. 2015 while people were watching the emmy's and everybody's on the red carpet smiling. There's parts of the world that are like a Mad Max movie right now. Or like this refugee camp. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:42:29       I went to, er, it was a bunch of refugee camps in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. Like, people don't know it gets cold. They're like kids freeze to death. You know, every winter I'm in those camps cause it's like you're living under vinyl tarp in the mountains.

Speaker 5:          00:42:45       Jesus Christ. It's, it's very strange that the world is so uneven that there are places like the Congo that are like, that exist on the same timeline as park avenue, that there's, there's people that have door men that dress up like the guys that were holding open the door for Putin, hop into Uber, limousines, and you travel around the city, you know, with the right fragrances and the in the car. And it's, it's, we will live in really strange times because I think the disparity that existed that that's kind of always existed. There's always been disparity. There's always been, you know, the haves and the have nots. And in some places it's on a much more grand scale, but it's never been so obvious, especially cause

Speaker 1:          00:43:35       so many people are online now. Like I think a lot of people maybe don't realize that.

Speaker 5:          00:43:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       Especially in the Middle East, like how Internet connected people are. When I was in dummies, which is this a refuge, it was the refugee camp in Iraq that I, that I was at. One of the most popular stories was the store that was selling personal wifi hotspots. And you'd have people that were living in like a tent, you know, with tarp and like nothing, but they'd have like a wifi hotspot and that's because they had a family that was scattered all around the world. And the only way to communicate them with them was with whatsapp or with texting services like this or with skype. And so like the most important thing you were going to get was Internet access so that you could like talk to your brother that was in one country and your daughter that was in another, like that was more important than anything

Speaker 5:          00:44:20       you said, daughter, I'd heard your using.

Speaker 1:          00:44:22       Oh fuck. It's coming out man. I tried so hard. Yeah, I, yeah, it's, it's true. I'm from Queens originally.

Speaker 2:          00:44:33       Well, you know, it's Kinda crazy is I guarantee you it's, it is a high possibility that someone in one of those camps is listening to you right now. Oh, absolutely. Podcasts that have downloaded it from the Internet.

Speaker 1:          00:44:45       No, it's absolutely, it's absolutely true. Um, I wonder, I feel like if you're like, if someone who's listening is listening, you know, from a camper is listening, you know, in a refugee situation like I, man, how cool would it be to get someone like that on your show as a guest? If there is like a way with skype or something, that'd be amazing. I have to clear it with Donald Trump. Make sure he thinks it's our, our Syrian voices allowed into the country or would that cause isis, does isis come from Syrian voices? It's a disease of the mind.

Speaker 2:          00:45:13       He wants to stop the Internet to the Middle East. Have you heard this? This is the latest Donald Trump thing.

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       I had a signing last night, so I unfortunately I missed the intellectual glory. That was the republican debate. So fill me in on this. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:45:24       Didn't see it. But he was talking about this, that one of the things that they would do or he would do is knock off the internet to certain parts of the Middle East.

Speaker 1:          00:45:35       Why? Like how's that?

Speaker 2:          00:45:37       Well, because that's how they're plotting against us. Molly crab apple while you sit in your wonderful New York apartment writing books about sex, the terrorists, the terrorists are winning.

Speaker 1:          00:45:49       Oh God. I mean does so in Isis territories that those fuckers are occupying, they got rid of private Internet access in people's homes because they're really scared of the Internet. Two, they are super scared because there are all these citizen activists and journalists that are revealing shit about them on the Internet right now. Like if you're in rock cod, the only way to even get online is to be on these Internet cafes that are kind of run by dudes with Isis connections. Whoa. And, and um, that's because isis is also really fucking scared of the Internet. They really don't like it. Really? Yeah. Why is that? Well, because a lot of Syrians living and Iraqis living in their territories fucking hate them and they give Intel on them. Two, um, foreign journalists.

Speaker 2:          00:46:36       That's fascinating. So the Internet acts as a way that they communicate and establish plans, but it also acts as something that's plotting against them. Exactly. Same as the internet does it everywhere else. No, I mean, it's just communication. It's just people. Yeah. When you're a group of content that the whole world hates and your online guarantee, you're going to get some haters.

Speaker 1:          00:46:57       Yeah. I mean there's a, there's one group of, um, journalists there that became very famous that's called Brocka as being silently slaughtered that, I mean they did tons of work documenting isis shit and isis, I mean beheaded two of their members that were in Turkey and there are plenty of other citizen journalists there and yeah, isis is dead scared of normal of normal people who are living under their fucking occupation using the internet. They hate it.

Speaker 2:          00:47:24       You know, another thing, they're scared, they're scared of being killed by women.

Speaker 1:          00:47:27       So that's kind of, I think, I think

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       this is my theory that um, the Kurdish group, they won't go to heaven if a curtis girl kills them thing. I think like one person said that and then it still how much play it got in the media and they were like, aw man, this is good pr. Let's keep it, let's keep milking this one. I think so, yeah. That's, it makes sense. Ideologically, like within their religion. Is that something that they believe in? She get killed by a woman. You don't get all the virgins. No, I think that's bullshit. I think that would be, I think maybe there's like a macho thing, you know where they're like, well fuck a girl, girl shot my leg, but I, it's not a theological thing. Damn. It seems so good though. I know. It really, it seemed, it seems sweet, like some crazy Amazon scenario chasing isis and they just run away because they're scared of being killed by the women who are fighting Isis in the Ypj or you know, ferocious soldiers.

Speaker 3:          00:48:17       But either isis is scared of getting, they're scared of getting killed. Our soldiers were really allocated or if that was true though, allocated our resources correctly, I think there's probably enough really mean bitches in the world. We could put together a hell of a fucking army. I think so. I think so too, with tons of motivation. Could you imagine just jet jetson bombers piloted by women? Like that's it. Only women. Only women going after Isis because if they get killed by these women, there are Fox and they don't get to go to heaven. I think. I think you'd have to do like a more, I think at the bombings aren't doing shit against Isis. I think the Ypg is doing is, you know, I think I'd have to be more on the ground. Well, especially in Afghanistan, right? That's one of the things that people have always had a problem with invading Afghanistan.

Speaker 3:          00:49:09       It's essentially a series of mountain ranges occupied by warlords. There's not like, there's not a lot of access. It's not so easy to get to. The thing with Isis is what they do is they, I mean they move in, they occupy cities like a military occupation and they try to marry people and build families and they try to insert themselves as much as possible into the fabric of a city. And that's partially, in part, it's them making it so that if, if you, you know, bombed Rocca, he would be murdering hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians who were just too poor to get out to do it. Strategically embed themselves as a human shield. Yeah, exactly. And like there were, I mean the majority of Rocca is there like farmers who couldn't afford to get out because it's expensive to even get out of Syria. What a mess. What a crazy, chaotic, psychotic mess. It's really bizarre. That member, that Obama speech that he had on television, was it a year or so ago or he was talking about eminent military action against Syria and the whole country went, what are you fucking crazy? And then it just, it just stopped. Literally like silence. Like you didn't hear anything more about it. They just completely backed off just because Republicans and Democrats, everyone was like, are you out of your fucking mind? Like what could happen in look what happened

Speaker 5:          00:50:27       in Afghanistan? Look at the, the massive negative reaction the American public has had all these military actions. You're going to start up a new one on in Syria for what reason? Because somebody got gassed because they gas people. Like what do you, what you, what's going on that we need to sacrifice American lives over there. Exactly. Like what's the cause of all this?

Speaker 1:          00:50:46       I mean, what's really sort of a so tragic about Syria is that, um, Obama, um, this, this is me saying an opinion that's not necessarily mine, but it's opinion of that I've gotten from speaking to refugees. It, um, a lot of people I think felt very led on by what Obama said and they felt like, oh, there's going to be, you know, some support or I don't know, some action against Assad because I mean whatever one thinks about American intervention or not intervention, what asides did is a crime against humanity on a massive scale. What, whatever we think do you think we should have done what he did was fucking horrific. And anyone who is in Syria and you know who was at the receiving end of that would very often once someone else to intervene and explain to people what he did do, he ran like an industrial scale, um, arrest, torture killing program. He does something called barrel bombings, which are taking like basically like dumpsters full of t and t and shrapnel and dropping them in populated areas to target schools, targets. Hospitals are destroyed. A large swathes of Aleppo. And this isn't, this isn't me saying, um, this isn't me saying that I think the US should have intervened because I, I, I still don't know. But I, I'm very against the US intervening in general and anything cause I think we always fuck it up. But he also factually didn't do those things.

Speaker 5:          00:52:21       It's just hard to imagine that someone is capable of doing shit like that where people can get to, where people can get through in their minds that the, that allows them to do shit like that.

Speaker 1:          00:52:33       I think what it was was his, one of the things that was quite influential was his father put down, I'm sort of incipient insurgency opposition thing, uh, in a city called Hama by killing 20,000 people and like bombing the fuck out of the city. And it, it, it put it, put it down. And I think that perhaps in his mind he thought that he could do the same when there was an uprising against him. But obviously that wasn't what happened.

Speaker 5:          00:53:00       Well that's um, I mean that's a story of Saddam Hussein and his sons as well. I imagine being the son of a, an evil, brutal dictator.

Speaker 1:          00:53:08       Yeah. And you're just like, well, those sons was ended up like these fucking nero figures. Don't say it. I mean, it's like the father is very often like a thuggish military guy and then the sun is this a princeling who always got whatever he wanted in his life and that's when it gets so, so weird. You see

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       with like Kim Jong Il also. Exactly. Yeah. And Uday and Qusay is, I would assume, yeah, those motherfuckers who, God or it's more horrible stories about what they would do. They would find women that were getting married and they would take them from their husband, rape them, and then feed them to dogs. They had dogs that they had in their basement that they just didn't feed. And they would throw people that they didn't like to their dogs and the dogs are Tam apart. Whoa. And then they would watch of course. But the, the, the fact that a person can get to that place, that a person can get to that place where they eat w in the weirdest way. We're flexible in a beautiful way. You know, when you can see someone who can create beautiful songs and art and they can touch people with their words and their thoughts and their deeds and you know, they can, they can be something inspirational and amazing, but we're also flexible in this horrific way where they could play upon the worst fears and the worst, the worst emotions that people are capable of manifesting.

Speaker 5:          00:54:30       And they could just just attack and torture and maim and brutalized and murdered and they could do it wantonly and do it with no for no real reason. They could do it sadistically for fun, for recreation. The fact that that that's the same beast has just, they're human beings and it's like, I mean there could obviously be some anomalies in the brain itself, but essentially a good portion of what makes a person who they are is their environment and their life experiences and the nurturing and like how they were raised and what they're exposed to. And we get, we're so flexible and pliable because we want to survive that we're capable the same species during the same time period. We're not talking about like cave people that cannibalize because they didn't have books than it and understand it was bad and they had invented language yet over talking about people with the Internet, they're capable of doing these horrific things, but at the same time there's someone like, you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          00:55:32       You fill in the blank. There's a lot of beautiful people out there that do things, but my friend Justin wren was um, from these photos over here who goes to the Congo and he lives with the pygmies for six months a year and he, he need builds wells for them and he gets malaria and almost dies and you know, he's an American from Texas. He just went over there and saw how incredible these people were and he dedicates his life to it. He's like, to me, he's like one of my favorite people because he's just like this beautiful manifestation of like experiencing like friendship and love from these people. Then just becoming incredibly dedicated to try to take care of them. But these people exist at the same time. It's just, it's so hard to understand like a parent is a fucking parrot. You know, some parents you can tame and they'll eat peanuts out of your hand and other ones they live in the trees, but they're fucking parrots and were like everything all at once.

Speaker 5:          00:56:20       We're so, we're so weird or so weird, you know? I mean I'm a fan of people, don't get me wrong, but here you're pro people. I'm a huge fan of people. I love people. I think we're amazing but we're also horrible. You know, it's, it's what we're capable of is so strict cause like, you know, like you or I are not capable of those things. So for us to see that, like what we consider a horrible person in America, it's like someone who's says something horrible on, you know, on twitter about race or something like that or someone who's a, you know, disparaging about President Obama or you know, it's like, it's so minor and a lot of ways what we shame people for here, you know, he didn't use the correct gender pronoun you piece of Shit. You know, meanwhile there's terrible, terrible things that are going on at the same part of the world in the same time in other parts of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:57:15       I mean, I, I don't believe in our race to the bottom. It shouldn't be like, well, you haven't like thrown someone to the dog, so you're cool, you know? No, but I, I definitely, I, I definitely hear where you're coming from.

Speaker 5:          00:57:27       Hm. That is funny, right? You can always look at like Saddam Hussein's kids and I'm like, I'm fine.

Speaker 1:          00:57:32       Feel like all I did was punch a baby. I did not dog shamed me if my dad punching, shaming sharing's a new thing. Right. When did shaming come around? I mean, public shaming, like the term public shaming is sort of an old American tradition. We have a book called the scarlet letter about public shaming. Yeah. But not as a phrase, you know, like fat shaming, you know what you mean when it, when it became, um, slut shaming. Like these terms are very new. These are like, these are like this new concepts. I mean, I think that they're their new corn. Just to describe, to describe, um, you know, old behavior. The truth is I do think people should be criticized for like, I dunno, I feel like if you're going on twitter and you're writing, you're a dumb whore to random women. Like that is jerk ass behavior and people should tell you that you're being a fucking jerk for it. And she's really into it. That's her thing. She's previously expressed days. She says previously expressed a desire for that. Yeah. They have like an established relationship. You're a dumb whore. Oh, you fucker get over here. Like, yeah, no creek previous consent, but here's rent to random random women who don't have that in their twitter bio. That that's what they're into. I think like you were being a jerk ass. I'm someone who's like, fuck you. Stop calling random women whores on twitter. Oh yeah. I think that, I think that's fine.

Speaker 5:          00:58:50       That what we were talking about before about having no, um, that one day we're going to come a time where there's no boundaries between people. I'm really absolutely convinced this. Like, I've, I've, uh, I've had these weird, um, trips in a sensory deprivation tank where I've sort of seen this take place, the slow acceptance of what is the ultimate inevitable reality. And it, it kind of freaks me out sometimes I have to get out of the tank cause I just can't handle it because I really, I think like life as a person, we have this idea that we're gonna put our shell on and we're good. I've got Michelle on, this is going to be no shells. It's, it's, we're gonna just have to somehow or another like, you know how you have friends? Like I have friends that, uh, I'm almost too close to them. I know everything they do. You know, like, what'd you do? Ah, you fuck her? Why'd you do that? Oh my God, what are you doing? I just fucking lost my mind. And, but you know, everything like we're going to know that about everybody. It's just a matter of time.

Speaker 1:          00:59:44       But the thing is I don't think it's going to make us nicer to each other and make us like each other better. I think that one of the things that twitter has done, I mean I love twitter, like I'm addicted to twitter. I love it. I think it's really cool. But in addition to having a speak to all sorts of amazing people that we never would have spoken to before, it also like really revealed what other people were thinking and made us like really dislike them for it to knit a lot of ways. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Well it's also the anonymity, the ability to reach out to molly and just say some mean shit anonymously. You know, you're just this little egg. I'm a little egg, you know, that's all your, your icon is and you know, you have been a series of letters to represent your egg and then you're like, fuck you molly crab asshole. You fucking bitch already your bull shit. I mean, I believe that's how it went down. I think you're a fucking attention whore. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then you read that, you're like, oh,

Speaker 5:          01:00:36       you know, you've fucking anonymous person is searing my soul with your hate.

Speaker 1:          01:00:43       I mean I don't like, I get a lot of like as a, as I'm sure you do. I think, okay, so this is the thing. Sometimes the thing that helps him put it in perspective is I got 70,000 twitter followers and I think if I ever had any other grouping, like any real life grouping of 70,000 people, like what would be the jackass ratio that I would expect in that

Speaker 5:          01:01:01       it's always one in 100 that's my thought. My thought is it's one, it's the real 1% we should be concerned with the jackass 1% the mean people. Yeah, because I think they're, they're so, they're so calm. Like the idea of the 1% being like the real problem in America being successful people. I think if you've got the 1% of all the successful people together, only 1% of them would be evil cunts. I really believe that. I think 1% of Pr, I think you keep going with the 1% like how many of those will add of those people that are evil, how many of them are true sociopath? Probably ones percent of them too. I was like, he keeps going. But if you have 300 million people, you're dealing with 3 million assholes. Like if there's a hundred people, one of them is going to suck. And if you have 300 million, you have 3 million people that suck. And if they all get ahold of your twitter account, you're going to think the world has ended. You're going to think my God and you won't see the other 99. You won't see them because the hateful words of the one will just be overwhelming. And every now and then molly, your book's amazing collection.

Speaker 1:          01:02:05       Yeah, you'll,

Speaker 5:          01:02:05       you'll try to find it. I mean, I've watched people in scale, like I had, like we were talking about Lance Armstrong and I looked at the mentions that Lance Armstrong gets on twitter. Like anything he writes and like anything he wrote like had a great time, you know, uh, doing these, uh, this race was as good at times when you're running away from drug tests, like sake, I think they can't help it. It's like they, people just love to dig. They just love to fucking reach out of that rib cage, pull out your heart. Ah, they can't help it. They know they can. And it's also a new ability that human beings have sort of cultivated over the last couple of decades really didn't exist before. Well, before, like you would had to have like written on

Speaker 1:          01:02:46       letter left your mom's basement, walked all the way down to the block. Humans basement. Why don't I say like Your Dad's base and your girlfriend's based and there's so many other basements these people could be in. Like why do I have to put them all in their mom's basement? Because it's somehow or another for a man, the most pathetic thing. Like, mom, I'm done here. Mom. Stop yelling. I'm doubting. You're telling people they're wrong on the internet.

Speaker 5:          01:03:07       You're typing up a fucking stone and trying to hurt land, shine, kneeling, cycling, lying. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:03:19       I like, I liked that. That was, that was a, that was a good, uh, good personification of that.

Speaker 5:          01:03:24       It's like this feeling of just wanting to just somehow or another get a reaction and it's all losers. That's unfortunate. I mean, I hate to say that to those people, right? They're like, no, no, I'm a, I'm a winner. And I think he just, what he did was dishonorable. Okay, well then you might think it, but if you actually are sitting around trying to attack him, I guarantee you that his energy and focus that you could have best spent on your own life 100%

Speaker 1:          01:03:49       or like maybe if you're just like, I mean critical person who is a winner, you could have written a really great essay about like juicing in the sport that like really took him down and then, yeah, and then you have challenged, you're like meaning this in a positive and winning direction.

Speaker 5:          01:04:01       But if you really looked at the essay, honestly, you'd have to take down the whole sport itself. You mean you really wouldn't. Who if you want to take down Lance Armstrong, you'd have to take them down by his individual acts actions in defending his actions in the sport. Yeah. That, that's, that's, he admits that he, he's pretty open about the fact that he fucked up and then he made some pretty horrible choices. Does it though the sport itself, like if you really wanted to write an essay, you'd write what the fuck you bunch of steroid using bike riders. That's what you got.

Speaker 1:          01:04:33       Yeah. And you'd write like properly about the economic impetus and how all the ways that like top people were able to kind of condone it but then get out with their hands clean and you'd write something like that really channeled your meaning this into a positive direction that really tore shit.

Speaker 5:          01:04:47       Yeah. That's a weird thing about blogs too though. There's a lot of pee. I've, I've read some really mean blogs. People write about folks and I'm like, what's interesting about this is like blogs or not a conversation. It's like you're, you have this, uh, attack, this focused attack of, of an individual. But if that individual was there and they could respond to this and you could have a communicate, it would be a different thing. Like what it is is like, uh, it's like a, a message tied to the Clav, a raven that you're sending out. Like it's, there's, so it's such a one way thing. It's, it's not, it's not really an effective way to communicate cause you're not really trying to communicate. We tried to do is hurt somebody. Like when you see attack blogs, I mean they're the worst. Yeah. Well there's, there's some that deserve it. Like if you could write an an expo, say on someone who runs some horrible business that is using slave labor or fill in the blank on some terrible scenario that you could expose. Yeah, I mean the, the, the world should see it like, okay here Matt, Tie Ebs Expos, a's on the financial collapse. Brilliant, perfect. And you know that those are real, legitimate and important. But I've read some things that people written, they're just about like random celebrities or you know, like

Speaker 1:          01:05:59       you're just like why? Why are you that invested in tyler swift? Like how do you have so much opinion then it's Taylor.

Speaker 3:          01:06:05       Fuck, I'm not fucking Dork. I don't know anything. Well I'm a fucking Dork to haters. Gonna hate, hate, hate that fucking song. I liked that song, goddammit. Cause I have daughters and I have a wife that God damn songs playing all the time. They play in the car. When I'm with them, I'm like, that's okay, you can play that one. I liked that one. Cool. That's awesome. Sudden I'm embarrassed that I like it. It shows like diverse musical tastes. That's all right.

Speaker 5:          01:06:30       Definitely have that. Sometimes too diverse, you know. But um, I dunno how we got onto that, but it's like, yeah, like mean takedowns of like a some singer like come on really is this terrible person really affecting your life in some strange way. But the like the comments that people will make to people, I believe on twitter and facebook, all these, and not facebook, it's like slightly less anonymous, but all these anonymous methods of communicating, they're gonna dissolve slowly but surely the boundaries between people. It's not just going to be the NSA that can find out exactly what you're doing and who's saying what to who. It's going to be the whole fucking world. Everyone's going to be able to do that and it's going to be very, very weird. Very weird. The other thing is like, people,

Speaker 1:          01:07:17       we'll find out the people who are doing that. I remember there was this like asshole who made a bunch of twitter accounts to um, right that women who worked in tech but then just brand and women. He didn't like Rick Kuntz and he really fixated on this one woman who is a programmer at Tor, which is an anonymous web browser. And he like made seven twitter accounts at one point until I tell her she was a cunt. And so finally she was like, she was like this, this has gone on long enough. And um, when he was visiting her website, presumably to find more proof that she was a [inaudible], she got his Ip address track down where he worked in, posted his name and his workplace. And with the line that was like his classic she wrote should have used tour foucault.

Speaker 3:          01:08:02       I was like, you know, if you went up to a bunch of bunch of

Speaker 1:          01:08:06       women or if you went on to a bunch of women at bars and just screamed like cunt in their face, like eventually either them or their boyfriend or someone around is going to hit you. But because were doing this online

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       you thought like, wow, I can just go up to people and scream content. Nothing's ever going to happen. And some, you know it did. And there's no one's going to be sympathetic to anyone's going to get seven twitter accounts just to call some woman a con. Yeah. No, no one feels bad that he got hit that he got dogs were guy got talks. Well he was just expressing himself and exercising his first amendment rights. No, I think um, I really think we're, we're maybe a few years away from that just not being around anymore from it being some strange new world or we're all going to know exactly. I think I re I really believe that it's, we're maybe 10 years away from being able to reach those thoughts. Oh God. Can you imagine? Yeah. It's going to be very strange. Let's get the, all the romance and thinks is going to be gone because so much of like so much of like really exciting things in life is like anticipating and not knowing.

Speaker 5:          01:09:08       And then, you know, it's almost like the unwrapping of Christmas presents like, well, like when someone texts you, Hey, what are you doing? And you're like, yes, it's her book. You know, like there's that, that moment where you didn't know someone likes you or not like what's going on? And then you're going back and forth with each other is sending each other emails or you get that phone call out of the blue from someone he didn't know. They really were in the you and you're like, yeah, but when you know everyone's thoughts, it's going to be like all the Rome, ah, your enemy. You fucker. Why? Why are you playing? There's going to be no playing cool. There's going to be no, you know that all the, you know, you're, when you go to apply for a job, you're like, well, you fucking unlike me so I'll just get out of here. You think I'm a loser so you're not going to hire me. This is not going to mean the illusions. So although a lot of romance going to be gone a lot, a lot of the fun of things is not knowing. You know, we don't like that though.

Speaker 1:          01:10:01       No, I'm an, I'm an artist. I, I I like, I like the not knowing. I like the mystery. Sometimes

Speaker 5:          01:10:08       it's fine as long as it works out. Obviously it's worked out for you. You're a young woman, you're already, you already have a book published. You have many, many, many, many art pieces published. If journalism things that you've done. I was like, it's worked out for you and all this romance, but for some people that's not happening for them and they're like, God dammit. I just think it would be better if there was no secrets. But if you're that person and it wasn't working out for you, probably if there are no secrets, you would just have the crushing disappointment of realizing either no one was thinking of you or they're thinking bad things about you when it would just make you more unhappy maybe. But is what we are as human beings currently. Is that a static state and is this a state that we can expect to exist in, in sort of this form speaking with our mouths, making noises with our faces, interpretating it, interpreting it in our own minds and, and listening to other people say things and sort of establishing what their meaning is that it is that does this is going to be forever.

Speaker 5:          01:11:09       This is going to be how he went. No, no fucking way. Just like a monkey climbed off of a tree and you know, and eventually became a person 200 plus thousand years later or whatever the fuck it was. Whatever has led us to improve, to become what we are today is a continuous cycle. It's not going to stop. And I think that this idea that what we've got right now like, oh this, the romance of not knowing and you know, it's amazing and it all works out well. It's fucking, it's temporary. This is a little, when we look back in time to the amount of time that we've spent in this state, currently the Internet state, it's been so brief but so transcendent. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:50       Absolutely. It like the most transcendent thing. I mean I think as much or more than like the printing press probably more my God, one of the like really good articles I was reading about the refugee stuff is by the Iraqi journalists that I always plug cause he's so brilliant. Plays up dual a hud and he did this piece about, you know, people making the trip and one of the things he talked about is that this was a trip that when he was a young man in Iraq, he had tried to pay a smuggler to do and the smuggler like defrauded him and he didn't get to do it but it was all under the control of smugglers. Whereas now if you have a cell phone, like once you get from Turkey to Greece, once you do that little four hour boat ride, he just put on the gps maps on your cell phone and you walk, wow, you don't need smugglers after that. Isn't that crazy? It completely up ended the end to this entire like really like disgusting, nasty business.

Speaker 5:          01:12:43       Well similar in a lot of ways to the business of sneaking people over from Mexico. You know, I have a friend who has been living in America for more than 20 years because I've known him for, I've known him for 18 years. So He's, I think he's been living in America for like 27, 28 years. And that's how he came over. I came over in a fucking van in the middle of the night and they got out and there was a guy behind them that had a, a stick, like, uh, they, they would take like a giant, like branch from a tree with all the leaves. And as they walked, one guy behind them would waive the branch back and forth to cover up their footsteps. Yeah, yeah. And they did it through the middle of the night. And, um, they eventually got to some sort of border town where there was an Arizona or whatever and uh, they made their way and infiltrated into cities and eventually found jobs and barely survived, barely fed themselves. And Fuck, man, he just imagined that life. And then there's all these people we've got to tighten up our borders.

Speaker 1:          01:13:45       Fuck man. Like that. That's high enough that the borders should, I mean, trump's like idiot idea of that wall. It's not even like physically possible to build, cause we'd have to go through all these like rivers and take over people's land and his like, how did we get presidential candidates who, not that they're stupid, not they're crazy, but who like fundamentally denied physical reality. Like this is what, this is where we are right now. We, yeah, I don't think he

Speaker 5:          01:14:07       necessarily as a presidential candidate, I don't buy it.

Speaker 1:          01:14:10       You think you think it's to the other ones look moderate

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       and reasonable? No, I don't think it's, um, some grand conspiracy. I think it's him riding this crazy wave of attention and trying to think in his own mind that it's justified because he's shining light on these important issues in a way that only he can because he's independently wealthy and he's not bound to, you know, the, um, the, the, the wishes of his constituents. He can just kind of go out there and say, I want to put a giant wall up and call it the trump wall and then we're going to keep off the Mexicans. Yeah. And meanwhile, everybody wants to fucking kill him and in his face as fallen off his bones. It's just, it's so bizarre. It's so cohen brothers ask that like, he really does seem like satire. I mean, he's like the ultimate American satire president candidate.

Speaker 1:          01:14:59       Did you ever interview him like back before, right?

Speaker 5:          01:15:01       No, no, I've never met him. Nothing.

Speaker 1:          01:15:04       I, uh, I, once I confronted him at a press conference in Dubai, it's like one of my finest moments. I know. I was really scared because Dubai is a, it's please state, you know, there's no free speech there. It's real, real, you know, they'll lock you up and they're rich enough. They don't really care about your American passport that much. And so as that, this press conference where he had these

Speaker 1:          01:15:24       golf courses that he was licensing his name too. And I had some Intel that the guys that were building the golf courses were getting 200 bucks a month to do construction work. And like the Emirates, the average salary of an Mrr adi is, I think it's like sixty thousand sixty thousand a year I think. And he's gets 200 a month, you know, did you like hard ass construction work? And so I get up during the press conference where he's getting his ass kissed and I'm waving my hand around and I say, you know, Mr. Trump, you've been saying how, you know this all stands for luxury and your construction guys are getting $200 a month. Are You satisfied with that? And his mouth fucking shriveled. I've never seen it like shriveled, this little tiny bros but of hate. And I got so yelled at. But um, he yelled at you.

Speaker 1:          01:16:06       He didn't yell at me that the, the underling yelled at me. He's under the underlying from the MRI pr firm that was there. What did they say? That's not an appropriate question. How's that? Not Appropriate. I know. And then the next question was, Mr. Trump, you stand for luxury in Dubai stands for luxury. Is that why you do buy like each other? Some tough, tough stuff. So did he answer you? No, he didn't. He didn't answer me. He just like mouth trivial and like Ivanka his mouth when all small like everyone's mouth went really small with anger.

Speaker 5:          01:16:34       Cos this is a long time ago, right? Is that the drawing?

Speaker 1:          01:16:37       Yeah. Yeah, that's the drawing and man, ah, ah, he was so angry at me cause I, cause I took like a little startup to just picture of him. But yeah, he was like, they're talking about how New York should be more like Dubai because in Dubai everything was perfect. Yeah. Yeah. He, he liked the ass kissing. He said that he built the greatest architectural buildings in New York. I beg to differ.

Speaker 6:          01:16:58       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:16:58       Wow. He really said that. You know, my friend Joey Diaz grew up in New York and he said, one of the things that people forget about Donald Trump is all the disputes that he had with small local construction that used, they use for projects. And now these people like wound up going out of business and they, you know, they couldn't, they couldn't battle him financially. And like, he's like this wave of people that hate him in that whole construction business. I don't know who's right and who's wrong about those disputes, but the idea that you could take that model, which is already problematic in America and then take it and wrap it up in a giant way and do buy that fucking piece that vice did on those people that are in Dubai that are trapped where they take their passports. I think that, I think I did a big piece on that.

Speaker 5:          01:17:46       Did you? Yeah, there was a, um, um, how long ago was your amendment? No, this was a few years ago. Like maybe six or seven years ago. There was a, um, a camp that they went to and these men were crow, just openly weeping. There was showing this like hole in the ground where they have to shit. And they were showing how poor the water is and they had promised them a substantial amount of money per month and they were coming over from India and the Philippines, a lot of third world countries. And once they got there they would take their passports away and then reduce their salary traumatically, you know, and they couldn't leave and they were forcing them to build these structures. Exactly. Yeah. It's totally like that. And then the other really fucked up thing is that like these guys, they're not passive. Like they try to strike and stuff, especially very often.

Speaker 5:          01:18:34       Not only do they reduce their salaries, they just don't pay him. Like, and can you imagine like you've like a wife and kids at home, you know, who are like depending on you to like go to another country and you know, make, make money for the family and then you just don't get paid for three months. Like, it's like, you know, breaking a whole family. And so these guys will do strikes, they'll do sit downs in front of the buses and then they hold them off to jail and deport them when they do that. And it's, it's scary. It's so scary that it's again, what we're talking about, the spectrum of human behavior that, I mean it's like a few steps away from being a serial killer, but it's just this s s sort of pathological detachment from compassion. You know, that you don't, you don't care about these people that are risking their lives to make these giant buildings that are, these royal people are gonna walk on roses and they throw at their feet and step into these things and go skiing in the middle of summer.

Speaker 5:          01:19:23       And these gigantic buildings they make, they make these crazy fucking structures over there cause they, they almost have an unlimited budget. It's almost like they have like an idea in their head, you know, I would like to fly in doors and they're like, okay, we're going to build you a mile high fucking gigantic building where you could fly inside. And you know, and then you have planes that you could fly indoors. Like I shouldn't even have said that because someone in Dubai is probably listening and a light bulb went off in their head yes and indoor flight course. And it's what's so strange is like I was prepared to like hate Dubai. How Dubai look like. I hate how Dubai is, but I mean I was prepared to like aesthetically hated as well as ethically

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       hated. But what's weird is when you go there, it's beautiful. That's the thing. It's like, I remember I was looking at that building like the Shard, you know the worlds, the worlds tallest building Alberg did you go in it? Um, I went down to the ground floor and I bought a $20 cup of coffee. $20 is $20. Oh my God. How it taste like a fucking cup of iced coffee. We have a day. Was that was just sort of a bevel an object. But so I was like going into, I was going into it like prepared to like really like aesthetically judge it too. And like the thing is it's like so beautiful. And then I was remembering, I was like for cy is also beautiful and look at how that was made and it was this weird thing cause you, you think about how splendors always made and how like the most beautiful things in the world, you know, always are constructed and you definitely go there and you're like, this is the city of the future and this is the new aristocrats and this is beautiful and it's all being built by slaves who are dying to build it.

Speaker 5:          01:21:03       Well I dunno if it's the future with stuff in the future of that area, but they just have this strange world where it was incredibly poor up until just a few decades ago and then all of a sudden they start pumping oil out of that place and the money is astronomical and the change in the amount of money that area has, the few that have it, the, the, the, the disparity of wealth is just unimaginable.

Speaker 1:          01:21:32       One of the kinds of interesting things that they did in Abu Dhabi, which actually I kind of, I admire it, is that in a lot of countries when they get oil money, like someone steals it, you know, up top. But in Abu Dhabi what they did was they gave citizens a lot of entitlements to stuff. Like you get free education. If you're in a Morati, you get a free healthcare housing, get a stipend, a Mrit. Women are like super, super educated. Most, uh, most of the phds are Mrid women. So like, that's awesome. But the thing is, the flip side of that is like citizens are only 10% of the population and it's like 90, 90% of the people, the people who do everything, like the engineers, the shop, the shop workers, the maids, the, um, you know, construction dudes like the people who do every manner of work are not citizens and have no rights to anything. Wow.

Speaker 5:          01:22:19       That's a trip. We're, you know, we're looking on the outside at that place. I mean, I, I've, I've talked to people that I've been, I've been to Dubai and I've been to Abu Dhabi, I was there for a UFC event. And uh, you know, without getting into anything political, it's beautiful, you know, and you're like, wow, these are, these people have done a great job and constructing these things. But the guy, the guys that I was with, um, some of them went to, uh, they went to Dubai because we have the night off and I was tired so I to stay home, if they went to Dubai, the guy, we're going to go to a bar. And you know how it just, some places you can go to drink, like you have to drink in certain play because it's illegal to have alcohol, but there's some sort of weird loophole and they said it was all Russian prostitutes.

Speaker 5:          01:23:04       They said it was just like these predatory coyote women that had crossed over. I would just like looking to dig just a pocket cash from banging all these rich dudes. And I was like, whoa. Like I, the, my friend went to a bar and he said, I'm not bullshitting. This bar might've been 80% hookers and I go, that might, he goes, I never seen anything like it in my life. Yeah. Women go over there to like, it's make to make some serious money. Bet You can. I bet you can fucking clean it up. But it's probably really dangerous too, right. You know, I never did. I never really did research on like sex work in Dubai. Like my, and I'm like, I'll be like, I know mostly about construction work in something about the maids and not so much, but I think for anyone who's not a citizen, it's dangerous because you like don't have any real rights if you're not a citizen.

Speaker 5:          01:23:52       Yeah. I remember, I think it was a British couple that were making out on the beach and they were arrested. They were just kissing. They were just, but they were openly showing affection on the beach and they were thrown in jail. I'm like, whoa. Wow. This is another one. This is the craziest one. There was a British man who, um, he had eaten a poppy seed Bagel and poppy seeds will, you will test positive for heroin if you eat, like it's trace amounts, but obviously it's not enough to be psychoactive, but it's enough to show up in a really comprehensive blood examination. So they tested this guy and uh, he tested positive for heroin and they put him in a fucking cell. They're like, he had a poppy seed Bagel at Heathrow airport and that big old got him locked up in a jail cell.

Speaker 5:          01:24:41       Like, whoa. There's another woman who was an executive at Brillstein Gray, which is a very prominent Los Angeles Entertainment Group. And, uh, she had, um, what does that shit that people take? It's a, it's a natural thing. Oh, I'm you take it when you want to go to bed. Uh, no, no, no, no, no. It wasn't that it was a Melatonin. Should Melatonin fucking Melatonin. Yes. You can't have Melatonin. They arrested her, locked her up, took her passport, put her in a jail cell for fucking Melatonin and then you know, somehow or another somehow got word of it and they got her out eventually. But what a terrifying moment it must have been for her. There was another guy who had a marijuana seed like, or a stem or a piece of marijuana that was wedged in between the tread of his shoes. That was it. And that was enough to put him in jail and he was going to be sentenced for some fucking astronomical amount of time.

Speaker 5:          01:25:39       And I don't know what happened to that poor guy, but unfortunately for him, he was a black guy with dreadlocks from England and they were like, ah, dude. Forever cage forever. Yeah, it's a really, really, really racist. Some of them are here. We'll go right here. Some of the horror stories would be reported by the BBC four year jail term for possession of 0.003 grams of cannabis stuck to the bottom of his shoe. That's the guy that's Keith Brown. Robert Dalton on trial for alleged possession of 0.3 grams of cannabis, 0.03 unnamed 20 year old on trial for allegedly zaw cannabis. Mostly.

Speaker 1:          01:26:20       I had this one dude I met there, he's, he's on the rowdy and he was really interesting. His name is Allen Edmonds store and he, I mean like he's so brave, right. Cause you have so many privileges like as an Mri especially came from like a good family and everything, you know, you can really just coast it if you're Mrd and your, you know, from a well off family. And he made a web forum that let people um, discuss, uh, basically discuss the royal family frankly. And it also, it let people discuss religion kind of frankly. And if you were an atheist, you can talk about it on the web forum and they fucking, they locked him up for was hinged Elford I have to have to check this but I want to say was around nine months and then factored in with scabies when he was in jail and then when they let him out affected and purposely, yeah, that's what he said. He said that they like gave him a blanket that had scabies on it.

Speaker 1:          01:27:08       And then when he was out the, he had the series of unfortunate events that happened up over $100,000 accidentally disappeared from his bank account and no one knows how it got, how I got missing. And then like on two occasions at guys just sort of jumped out and beat the shit out of him and no one knows who they were. You know, it's a mystery and his car just gets stolen all the time. And the tires keep getting error taken out of it. And you know, magical mystery. No one knows who's behind that. Uh Huh.

Speaker 5:          01:27:35       Fuck yeah. Could you imagine if you like pissed off some royal family and they just hired some dude and they pay him and your job is to fuck with this guy forever. Like that's it. That's your job. Or you know, if you're like some sort of a rich billionaire character, you could hire a bunch of people and you could have a whole team, you know, and their, their jobs just to fuck with people. There's this one guy, I don't like them. Let's go get them. I mean, that wouldn't be hard. Like if you're like some trump guy and you've got billions of dollars and someone like molly crab, apple makes you feel like shit at some Dubai press event and you're like, fuck this bitch. This is what we're going to do. I'm going to hire a team and I'm going to fuck with molly crab apples life. I mean that's a reality. Like someone who's not wealthy, they could do something like that. That's scary shit. Yeah, they definitely, they definitely, they definitely could know they could hire somebody. Just every time he got to your car, your tires are flat. Like what the fuck?

Speaker 1:          01:28:30       At a certain point though, you'd probably put up like a little cam on your car and you know, or you'd hire some people to, yeah, exactly. It'd be like war of the proxies, war

Speaker 5:          01:28:38       proxies. That's it, right? Yeah. I don't know what, or have you gone to any places that were positive in your journalism escapades?

Speaker 1:          01:28:48       I love Istanbul. Istanbul is like one of my favorite cities ever. It's just so gorgeous. And it's so exciting. And you walked down like Easter collage I, Jesse, which is, um, sort of the main street in a neighborhood called Bay Olu and it's like, there's like lights and all these couples hand in hand and everyone's playing music. There's like kids selling flower crowns. It's just like, it feels like the sort of boulevard that every other boulevard in the world is trying to be. It's so magic. And I mean, I could, I could just walk around Istanbul like anytime of day or night and I would never not like have my heartbeat faster that city. Wow. So that's your favorite spot? That's my favorite spot. You'd ever be an ex. Pat moved to Istanbul and they're arresting a lot of that. They have a bad record unfortunately for arresting journalists.

Speaker 1:          01:29:33       They are one of the, uh, one of my colleagues. Yeah. One of my colleagues' advice, uh, this, um, brilliant, uh, Kurdish dude, um, Mohammed Rasulullah, he is like currently in jail right now for doing journalism and Turkey and vices. Like you're trying really hard to get him out, but he is like rotting in a jail cell and they claim that he is isis because he used it in cryption. He is a Kurdish dude. He's a Kurdish dude that like covers all of the anti isis stuff. He's not, he's not isis. This is so embarrassing and a name and yeah, he's, he's routing in a jail cell there. How long has he been there? Oh God, it's over. I think it's going to be going on three months now. And they, I don't think they've even really charged them yet. They're just like leaked statements to the press.

Speaker 1:          01:30:16       Wow. But, um, that, that aside, I, you know, the, the political repression aside, I really do find it assembled, be marvelous city. No place is perfect. They charged him with, so what is his actual w what is their grievance with them? What does the actual issue, he was going with these two British vice journalists and they were covering a clashes between the Turkish government and Kurds in the south and they pick them up doing that. So they just decided they didn't like him. [inaudible] he's doing Carl's in trouble. Well they, they've been actually like deporting and fucking with a lot of journalists who have been doing this. But I think, I think it's like they, the two British guys got out cause you know they're British. Whereas if you're in a rocky Kurd like no, but who's going to, who's going to be the person putting pressure on Turkey for you? I'm sure you're aware of that Saudi Arabian blogger that's been beaten repeatedly there. Yeah. So that's, that's a fucking horrible story too. That's one of the weirdest aspects of the United States. A relationship with Saudi Arabia. It's like we'll talk about all the atrocities that are committed by all these different countries, but Saudi Arabia is moderate and meanwhile they like sent, they sentenced a poet to death for poetry in Saudi recently.

Speaker 3:          01:31:29       How bad was the poetry though? Was it like def jam slam comedy in the little things? All right. Why are you poetry shaming? Why are you, why are you have what you have to free verse shame right now, you know? No, it's a phrase in reverse. When you make culture that doesn't like, or how did he meet her or anything? No, Haikus a short one. Right. I'm not much into poetry, but I remember I, I've gone to, I went to a poetry slam in Venice once, which is the perfect place to go because people take themselves so fucking seriously. And that was with a buddy of mine and we were a high

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       as you should ever be, what you were in public walking around talking to people like barely aware of reality. And we walked by this place and it was a poetry slam and we ha, I'm like, we have to go inside, we have to go inside. And we went inside and we were both like biting her hands. Try not to laugh because it was just so for po preposterous, just so you know, that really just pretentious save the world type

Speaker 1:          01:32:26       true.

Speaker 2:          01:32:28       20 year old white guys with dreadlocks.

Speaker 1:          01:32:30       Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I do. I mean, I think as a visual artist I have a similar thing when I see like really, really bad art work and I'm just like, not only are you shaming yourself, you're shaming my whole profession here.

Speaker 2:          01:32:44       Yeah. But you know what I also like as I've gotten older and sort of understand the nuance of life, like what this guy's doing, this is stupid shame shamp slam whatever poetry. What he really is doing is she's trying to express himself and he's developing as a person and right now it's kind of ridiculous to other people that are maybe a little bit more well versed in the ways of the world and with a more social experience. What he's trying to do is like he sees the world is wrong and he wants to get Social Brownie points by pointing it out and you know, and people clap and cheer and he's so, he sat down this loose leaf binder and wrote all this stuff out and he's just feels like he's really good. And one day he'll look back at that and go, what a fucking moron. I was just like, I'll look back at, I have a comedy notebook from 1990 and I should probably burn it in case someone breaks in my house and finds it.

Speaker 1:          01:33:35       Dude. Like if you die then someone will publish the collected papers of Joe Rogan and this will be your most famous thing,

Speaker 2:          01:33:43       a bit in there about wonder woman, like trying to explain wonder woman. It's so bad, but I was, you know, 21 years old or whatever the fuck I was at the time. It's like, it's just, that's what you're, you're when you suck then one of your yacht, I mean it takes a while to get good at anything.

Speaker 1:          01:33:58       Many years I, sometimes I look back at my old drawings and I'm like, how did I ever get hired as an artist? What delusional process did I ever think that I'd be an artist putting these things out there and again and again and again in the face of very deserted projection for many years. But it worked out right? Because like if you just keep chipping away at it and eventually eventually get through. And I really, I tried to actually really write about that in my book because I feel like sometimes a lot of artists they front and they act like, oh, I was just really good from the start and then it was really easy and I was like, no, I sucked from the start. And it was really hard.

Speaker 2:          01:34:31       Yeah. Most comedians will tell you that they suck from the start except the ones that are aren't that good, which will claim that they were always awesome was the ones, I think all my friends that are, that are really good, they'll all tell you they're fucking newer were terrible. I have um, two young daughters and one of the cool things is watching their art. Like they're really in the art, especially my seven year old is really into it. She draws every day. It's so cool. And, um, W W I watch her early stuff like I save all our and,

Speaker 5:          01:34:57       or at least representations like, you know, like some of it and watching like there early like control of her motor skills in our hands from the time she was like three to four years later. This just dramatic difference in what she's ability, you know, her ability to draw things and draw representations and figure out like perspective and sizes. And we were going through this book yesterday, she has this um, how to draw a figures book and it was the weirdest fucking thing because um, it was these princesses, it's just trying to draw princesses and um, I'm, I'm looking at the book and we're going through it together and you know, it's like one of those books where you have a framework, you know, like there's like balls and sticks and you try to like make the framework and then you had the close to the framework and totally.

Speaker 5:          01:35:48       But the women's legs were like more than twice as long as they should have been. When you're trying to do those like fashiony cartoon drawings, everyone is like so stretched out and that's what's weird is that you get so used to seeing that, that when you see like cartoon people done it, they're real proportions. They all look like weird and stubby. Yeah. Well that's gotta be weird for it because it doesn't seem that way for men. Like I was looking at the representations of men, they're fairly proportionate, but with, with women, it was all these insanely long legs and insanely skinny bodies. And I was like, this is fucking strange. So much so that I had a pointed out to her, you know, she's like, uh, you know, she's drawing it. I go, well here's the deal. You know, I'm like, this is, you can draw it like this.

Speaker 5:          01:36:35       One of the beautiful things about art is you can do whatever you want. If you want to make people that have giant hands that are size of those phone number ones that people were at a football game, you could totally do that. No one can stop you. It's cause it's just drawing is your expression. Whatever you want to do, but if you want to draw like a real person. And so then we started, I started showing her like a real human body. I'm like, okay, I'm going to stand up and I'll stand up next to the wall. And what we're gonna do is we're going to mark on the wall where the top of my head is and where my waist is. Awesome. And so we went from the top of my head to the waist and then we went from the waist down to the feet and I said, and you notice that like they're pretty much the same or at least close, but the women in these cartoon things you're supposed to draw were no bullshit.

Speaker 5:          01:37:16       There was twice as much length in their legs as there was from your waist up to their head. And she was like, well why do they do that? And I go, well thank some people think that it looks better to make people that aren't real, that that are like longer than reality, but like why do we accept that? Because like if there was a woman and that she had like, like a normal proportion body but enormous tits, just freakish tits. Like everybody would look at that and go, what the fuck are you making these kids draw, you know? But for, for whatever reason, like having the, and by the way, some people have freakish tits. There's, there's people that for whatever reason there's that, that poor dude who can't go

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       to the airport without getting frisked cause he has this giant Hog, has like some 20 inch Dick. I was like, he's got the, got the world's largest deck. And like they, they always check his pants to think he's carrying drugs or something. Well there's women out there that are just naturally born with enormous breasts and there's nothing they could do about it. There's no one born with knowing that there's no one six feet tall and only two feet of them are upper body and the rest of it, his legs, that's just doesn't exist. You know, it's, it's crazy. And even when I was at art school, we would have a different formula for drying figures and there was like they would measure it and head. So it's like this figure is nine heads and a fashion figure. W W which what they called it, which is, you know, that take her for a fashion illustration was like so many more heads than like any other figure.

Speaker 3:          01:38:41       And so it was like that crazy along the unaided thing and exactly what you're saying with like the crazy daddy long legs, legs. It's very strange because for men we, I've never talked to a man who understands that look because men are not attracted. I mean I'm sure everybody varies, right? But most men are not attractive to these stick figure people. But women are expected to be stick figure people to be models. It's one of the weirdest things. And then women think that in order to be attractive, they have to be like these media representations of women. So they have to starve themselves. And then men are like, no, don't do that. No one likes that. But, so like there's this weird disconnect between what the opposite sex or, I mean, I don't know, I can't speak for lesbians obviously, but with the opposite sex finds attractive and the representations of attractive women like sucked in cheeks, ba basically like on death's door, like, yeah, she's hot.

Speaker 3:          01:39:37       Like, no, that's weird. It's, it's weird to see someone all cracked out and skinny like that being the most with the most obvious representation of like a, a beautiful person in Nice clothes. I mean, I think it's, you know, fashion models aren't for men, you know, or they're not first, they're not for straight men. They're supposed to appeal to women who are buying the clothing. But do they even, I don't, I mean, I think, you know, fashion, I think, you know, women of all sizes, skinny, skinny, whatever. I think I'll be super beautiful as long as that's really you. Yeah. As long as you're not harming yourself to do it. But, um, I think that, I don't know, I think the idea is that you can just hang any clothing on them and it doesn't affect the hang of the clothing. So it's like almost like they're as close to it being like a coat hanger as possible. I think that's the theoretical underpinnings of it. Um, but yeah, it's true. Like if you look at like a, like a playboy model or like a model for like, you know, like black men's magazine or you know, like a model for Max. I'm like, they're like the super fit young women, you know, who like have like really good like muscles and a really curvy. Yeah, well people like men are naturally attracted to women with a certain amount of body fat. It's a natural thing to be

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       healthy. Like the whole idea of breasts and butts and hips being attractive is because genetically women who have those things will carry children better and we'll be more likely to be able to nourish those children because they're healthy. It's the total genetic thing. So much so this is the weirdest aspect of it. So much so that if a woman has fake boobs, like you know, they're fake, you know, there's no disconnect at all. You're absolutely aware that she has gone through surgery to cut her skin stuff. Bags of water in the air that make them stick out. You're like, oh, but they stick out more. Like men will be more attracted sexually and the sexual attraction is supposed to at least represent wanting to breed with that person like you. You are not just trekked, you're tricking yourself like it's the Wa like fake boobs are one of the weirdest things of all time.

Speaker 5:          01:41:50       If you really stop and look at, if we were, if aliens came down from another planet or even historians, because I guarantee you, like we were talking about like Bradley Manning and Chelsea Manning, there's gonna come a time in whatever, not so distant future the next hundred years, but they're just going to be able to turn you into a woman. You know, you're going to say like, I don't want to be a woman anymore. I'd like to be a man. They'll make you a man for a year. I mean like, Eh, I like being molly better. You go back to me and molly instead of Mike, Molly, and Mike the show, right? And you, I think they going to be able to do that with press. They're going to be able to do that with everything. They're going to be able to manipulate genetics to the point where, um, if you ever seen or listened to this or radio lab, a episode on Crispr, I hadn't know it, that crispr is an a new method of manipulating genetics that they, that they have invented.

Speaker 5:          01:42:38       It's a really super complicated thing that I'm going to butcher, but they've invented it by studying the DNA of viruses and they figured out how to utilize that, that sort of method to manipulate eventually at least human dna and the point where they're going to be able to change your traits. They got to make a change. They're going to be able to change so many different things, introduce genes into specific areas of your body and fix problems or change things that you don't like. Are they going to go do some fucking freaky shit? And this is just one invention that is, I think 2012 it was invented and by the time 2032 rolls around, who the fuck knows what they're going to have? I think we're really close to be able to, to just completely manipulate human bodies. But the point being when historians go back and they look at fake boobs, they're going to be like, what the fuck were these people doing? Like how weird is this? There's going to be a smithsonian that has like boxes of like silicone and this is the early days and this was when they went to céline and you know, we're going to look at that stuff going, what a strange time to be alive. But the thing is though, like with chicory and like matters of aesthetics, I didn't even want to call it trickery. I mean there's all sorts of like you can

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       like totally like admire, like think a guy like looks really hot and a sharp suit even though you know it's not really his scan. You know what I mean? It's, it's not, there's, there's a whole like sort of visual appreciation of other people that doesn't necessarily just have to do with like what's the, you know, the quote unquote real or like what's your genetic heritage? That's really true. A closer, a great exam. That's a really good example because that is weird. Like you see someone who's dressed sharp and you go, Ooh man, he looks great in that suit. Like that's a beautiful vest. Like wow, that looks awesome on him. That's a strange thing. Like you look good with stuff on you. Yeah, exactly. It could hang stuff on you that makes you look good or professional or authoritive or all of these other things, even though like they're just like stuff that you're wearing. I wonder if that's a truth. The same with hermit crabs. Oh my. Out a good shell. Could you imagine like someone's like, I'm wearing like the really slick cool. Shall look, I'm going to get all the girl hermit crabs right now. Yeah, probably right. There's some weird things in nature with animals doing things like, oh, how about animals that can actually money. Have you ever paid attention to octopus at all? Um, [inaudible] you know, I'm like, I'm pretty shamefully ignorant. You might have to educate me here. I had, well apparently cuddle

Speaker 5:          01:45:02       fish are just as bizarre if not more. But my friend Remy Warren is a, um, he's a host of a show called the Apex Predator where they, um, they monitor, they will, they sort of, um, try to emulate the different attributes that certain predators have and how they survive and see like if there's like some, a human version of that. And, and um, they, they, they like check out like how, uh, it's called heroin and that those tall birds Harun herons, herons. How do you say that? Heron heron herons. Um, like how they walk with their crazy long legs and then stab at the water looking for like frogs and shit. And he did one on octopus's and at of all the different animals we were talking about, he was like, you know, there's all these cool animals. They were talking about like how wolves will chase down packs of elk and how they corner them and in these canyons and draws and how they figured out how to trap them.

Speaker 5:          01:45:59       It's really fascinating. But when he started talking about octopus, he's like, dude, you have never see our fucking aliens. Like, look at these things like what color they can change their colors. Like this is real. They can change their colors and immediately adapt to their environment to the point where they're indistinguishable from the background. This is amazing. Oh, they're insane. They're insane. They're there. They can, they can instantaneously like within fractions of a second change the outside of their body to look exactly like a coral reef, not just in the image but in the texture. They do all kinds of, they can change themselves to look more like predators or like dangerous things. It's, it's incredible what they can do. You live from the coolest world. My God. Oh, the world's amazing. The world. The ocean still like, um, there's some new project that they're doing right now.

Speaker 5:          01:46:53       Um, or they're trying to map the ocean floor and there without a doubt they're going to discover some freaky fucking fish life marine life down there that we've never encountered before. But just these creatures were just starting to learn what these things are doing. Like, look at that like a flower or something on fast motion. That's an octopus. That's not to be a Wiki or something looks like, but watch this, it, it, it can merge with these, um, coral reefs and it looks like a coral reef. So it's literally developed this ability to turn his body into the shape of a reef. And then it's little tiny. I mean it's, it curls, it's tentacles up into little tiny legs and runs on two legs. It's fucking incredible. They're amazing. Wow. And look, it's like a teardrop shape. That's so cool. It's amazing. He's just octopuses is just cause they're fun to draw with all the tentacles and stuff.

Speaker 5:          01:47:54       But I, God, yeah, I had no idea. I had no idea. Like the fact that they can do it like that they just change like fucking what a weird world and the communicate with each other somehow through that. And we don't know how we know they're really fucking smart though. Are they going to take it all over after we destroy everything? The OCTOPI are going to rule the earth. Well, that's something I've been like really dwelling on lately when it comes to marine life and dolphins and orcas and I'm a huge believer that they are just as intelligent as us, if not more. And that what we're doing with seaworld and all these wild dolphin shows is nothing less than slavery. It's slavery of some alien intelligence that we can't communicate with. We don't understand what they're saying. So really, um, can hear you. I don't know what you're saying.

Speaker 5:          01:48:41       So fucking jumped for fish or starve. It's your choice. And um, I've, I've thought about it but like our ideas about what is intelligent, like we don't think that something's intelligent and less, it does exactly what we do. When we, when we think of intelligence, we say, okay, well molly, send me an email. I sent her an email back. I know she's intelligent. She's communicating through an email. The Dolphin is not a fucking make an email. He's an idiot. You know, like, but they don't need email. Like why do we need email? We need email cause we need to communicate well. They can communicate from miles through the water with their chirps and their noises. They recognize each other from, you know, years and years being apart from each other. Even though to us, they all look the fucking same. They can move and manipulate through three d space in the water.

Speaker 5:          01:49:26       They don't need a house because they're smart enough to go with a water's warm fishes everywhere and it's free so they don't need jobs. So all these ideas that we have is like what represents intelligence, all that stuff, stupid cause to them. I feel like, well I'm going to build a house and drive my car to work. They're like, what are you talking about, bitch or under the water? Like if you do like, I need a hoard it all the fish and my thing and like kill them and then I'll sell you the fucking fish for calc. That's a great idea. They'd be like, what? Like your high dolphin. I'm going to write you a letter from my laptop was, there's no internet down here. Stupid. There's no like you're a crap dolphin. Yeah, you're, you're, you're fucking laptops, not gonna work on their water asshole.

Speaker 5:          01:50:05       So all of our ideas about what, what's intelligent is only based on our ability to manipulate or environment or create things that didn't exist. So our intelligence is a very bizarre intelligence because it's, we the only intelligence that can not just manipulate our or environment that's local. But our environment globally, like we can, we can essentially change the weather. We can spray, we can cloud seed and make it rain and put like, that's one of the weird things they do in Abu Dhabi. They make it rain every week. They do it on purpose. They spray the sky with some sort of silver something or another that makes it, I don't forget what the exact compound is, but it actually causes it to rain. And they've been doing it like once a week for years. They have rainstorms that they manufacturer, we're freaks, we're freaks. And our intelligence is fundamentally built on dissatisfaction, which I mean we have to have, cause we're also like weak and not apex predators necessarily.

Speaker 5:          01:51:04       And we're getting weaker I think too. I think that's part of it. You know, if you went back to the early humans and you compare it like our tendons and bone structure and are they, are they really humans? Are they, are they stronger than us? It was that they were like shorter and stuff. The, her dolls were so not really humans right there, like a type of human and the how they categorize them, they were way stronger than I was. So they weren't just stronger than us. They were like really short. There were like five foot five foot two and, but like 220 pounds just fucking gorilla like with super thick bones and fic heads. And then they don't really know exactly how intelligent they were either. This, all this speculation as to whether or not they figured out tools on their own or whether they copied them from Homo sapiens and where homosapiens came from and they interbreed and there's debate on that as well.

Speaker 5:          01:51:56       And it's a, and then they're always fun on these, fucking knew their violin. Another one, like within the last couple of weeks they found another new species of human. We didn't know existed. They found some large tooth that, uh, turned out to be not category, it was a human tooth, but not categorized in any previous version of human beings that they were aware of before. Or if they found quite a few of them now, including the, I'm sure you've heard of like that. The hobbit people they found the island of Flores, that was 14,000 years ago. That's not that long ago. No luck. That's not before the beginning of recorded history as it, it's quill. I always a little bit before, a little bit depends on whose version of the beginning of recorded history is. There's a bought a bunch of people that believe, um, there's this guy that I've had on my podcast a few times now.

Speaker 5:          01:52:44       His name's Randall Carlson and he's an expert in, um, cataclysmic events and, uh, especially a asteroidal impacts. And, uh, him and this guy, Graham Hancock have worked together and Graham Hancock wrote this book called fingerprints of the Gods. It was a really controversial book in the 90s. And then now he has a new one called magicians of the gods, which is sort of shows how much of his early work that was widely criticized was actually substantiated now by science where these ancient structures that didn't make any sense. So they were trying to figure out like who fucking built these and how the WHO or how they here and archeologists sort of try to put like vague dates on them. And the idea behind it was that civilization has not evolved and it's not progressed on a, a straight plane, but rather there's been these peaks and valleys. And then what has happened is people have gotten this very high level of sophistication and culture and then massive cataclysmic disasters have white people out almost to the brink of extinction.

Speaker 5:          01:53:44       And they've arisen back up again. So like science is like, found quite a few of them. But one of the big ones they keep pointing out is that there's somewhere around 12,000 years ago, there was a series of uh, impacts on the earth and has been proven by science now because over the last few years they've discovered this stuff called, I think it's called Triton night, but it's essentially called nuclear glass. And it exists around where the, um, do nuclear tests and it also at exists at meteor impact sites and it's, the impact creates heat that's so intense. It turns sand and rock to glass and they find this stuff all throughout Europe and all through, and it's all around the same time period, which also coincides with the end of the ice age. And it also coincides with a thousand plus years later, the beginning of modern civilization, agriculture, mathematics. And so their, their theory is that that wasn't exactly the beginning, but that was a rebirth. And if there was most likely thousands of years of civilization that existed before that, but it was almost entirely wiped out when people are just bombarded with rocks from the sky.

Speaker 1:          01:54:53       I mean it makes a lot of sense, especially when societies where less interconnected, like the whole reason you know stuff various like you know, math or astrology survived the dark ages in Europe was because in the Middle East people were able to keep it alive. We live in a time now where unless they literally wiped out everyone, it'd be very hard to do that. But in a world where people don't have that level of communication where they don't have that level of connection where they don't have that level of knowledge sharing, it would be very easy for one society to kind of, you know, get to that peak and then something horrifying happening to it and no other societies could carry on that legacy.

Speaker 5:          01:55:29       Yeah, I mean it would be pretty easy, especially today in our culture because everything has become digital. It's one of the weirdest things about us advancing and evolving is that as things move to the cloud and as things become much, much less physical books like your book here, but much more like laptops and kindle

Speaker 1:          01:55:49       Kendall and it has 150 books on or something like that. It's that thin. It just sits right in my backpack. I mean the what, that's crazy. It's crazy. It's like this magicians thing. But also you could potentially like drop a server that had the only copy of something and have that only copy disappear. Yeah. Yeah. And if the power goes out, you're not getting any of this stuff. I had a friend who was um, he was going back into an area where he couldn't bring books cause there are checkpoints and um, had a lot of, and he um, had uh, his itunes account with something that like, it just, you, the country that was tied to you couldn't buy good ebooks on. So I remember I was getting him, I got him all these pirated copies of like 1984 and like James Baldwin and catch 22 and stuff to read and it, you know, he only has like a few hours of power a day and he's like reading like 1984 on his phone. And it was like the craziest illustration of both the like ubiquity of, you know, a book and also the limits of it in this sort of cloud edge. Yeah. There's a lot of limits of it. Our entire society is dependent upon the grid. If the grid goes down, almost none of this stuff is effective, but by the same token, he could smuggle all these books, past checkpoints and no one knew he had. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:57:06       Right. Yeah. No, I mean there's, there's definitely, if you're in a war torn area like that, it's a great, it's just, to me, it, it freaks me out when I think of, if something like that happened. Like there was, um, a big event, I think it was in Indonesia and at 70,000 years ago, they think that civilization was wiped out to the point of there being only a couple thousand people left on the planet. Yeah. Super Volcano erupted. Um, if anything remotely like that happened, we would instantaneously be brought right back to where people were 50,000 years ago.

Speaker 1:          01:57:38       Well, most of us don't have any sort of skills to maintain or rebuild anything. I mean, I don't, I, I know if there like the Zombie apocalypse, I, I'd be like fucking food or something. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:57:48       And what if we broke into a home depot? Like there's a home depot that's like a few miles from here. How many fucking people could get a hammer from there? There's a lot of people out here, you know, this is not enough. There's not enough hammers. Yeah. I mean, we wouldn't even, I mean, we'd hope the shelters that we have hold up, but then where are we going to get food? Like what do, unless we get into the ocean and go fishing, like what are you gonna get to shoot deer? How many deer? They're like five and this whole neighborhood, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:58:13       Well it's the level of population density we have could never be supported by like traditional agriculture ever.

Speaker 5:          01:58:18       Not Anymore. No. It's weird. You know what else is weird? The friend of mine pointed this out. He goes, why is it that when you walked on the street you see all these plants but none of them grow food. Like everyone grows plants everywhere. But there are all these fucking useless plants. Like what? Wouldn't it be amazing if like cities were filled with plants that grow fruit and all the, the grasses and stuff he saw were edible and there was lettuce everywhere. Like literally everything had food on it. Like it would be just the same amount of water used, but you would actually get something out of it. But we're so rich, they were like, nope. Pine trees. No, I want to oak, I want a beautiful oak here. Like we don't, you know, we don't support the, the, the, the trees and the plants around us that we can actually eat.

Speaker 1:          01:59:04       I remember one time I was in um, Spain and I was like 17, it was broke and I was with my, my, my friend and we saw like, wow, he's orange, cheesy, steal a lot of oranges to be like, climb up the tree and be like, steal all the oranges. And then we like peel them and then they're like bitter and dry and we're like, these are fucking decorative oranges. They tricked us. They tricked us with their there. These oranges are lies. And I, I think that they specifically probably planted those type of oranges to avoid bad people like us climbing the trees and stealing all of them.

Speaker 3:          01:59:34       Is that funny? You're a bad person because you're doing what people have done for the last week. Exactly. Yeah. We're bad person for picking fruit from a tree. How strange. This is w and it's also probably those were what orange is really tasted like before we start fucking with them. I refuse to believe that that's a cruel world.

Speaker 5:          01:59:53       Well, they, they know that the fact for like corn, a lot of other food was like really gross before people started manipulating it.

Speaker 1:          02:00:01       Truth, truth, but orange is, I want to, I want to believe that like prehistoric oranges were a tasty treat and these were not,

Speaker 5:          02:00:07       I dunno, I, I ate an apple the other day and me and my friends were laughing more eating these apples were like, these fucking things have definitely been fucked with like there were big, big giant and they were so juicy. We're like, what kind of genetically modified shit are we eating right now? Because these are just not normal apples. Giant juicy, delicious apples.

Speaker 1:          02:00:27       Probably in like the middle of apple off season two. Yeah, probably. Do you ever had a crab apple, molly crab apple? I have a photo of Mandurah crab apple tree, but I don't, I don't know if her friend took that one. I don't know if I've ever eaten the crab apple man. I, I, I'm sure this will get remedied someday, but uh, not, not yet. I don't think. Really. Yeah, I mean I, oh no, you're, oh my God. You're right. God, I'm getting like deep into the memory bank. When I was seven and I lived in far rockaway. I think one of the neighbors had a crab apple tree or it had the tree with the little apples. There's the ground, the crab apples. And I believe that, um, I believe I stole some of them and I believe they're very sour.

Speaker 3:          02:01:06       Yeah, I remember them. Yeah, they're very sour. I ate one of those when I was a little kid. Well more than once. I'm sure when I was a little kid growing up from Massachusetts, I remember biting into those things. Oh yeah. So much hope. Yeah, the good they're throwing at people though. That's what we use them for. The kids taste nice. Chuck them at each other. Small and hard like, yeah. Well you know your little tiny hands and get a good grip on the crab apple new whip it. Nice. Nice. Um, what else you got going on these days besides, I know you're promoting this book and uh, besides that, so I'm going to really excited

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       about this. I'm going to India for a month cause there's all these literary festivals in India, so I'm getting to good. Yeah, I'm getting to it. Like Dji pour and Mumbai and ben before. No, it's my first time in my life. So I'm really excited about that. And then besides that, you know, I think I'm reaching that point of burnout where I, and just, I'm like actually planning to take a month off. I know it sounds like fun. It sounds like fucking blast for me, but I think I, I'm going to like lie on a beach and go or something and read a lot of books. And other than that, the only thing I really have to talk about is my super dork hobby, which is a, um, I've been studying, um, literary Arabic for the last year and I got pretty good at translating stuff. Written stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:02:19       Really? Yeah. Yeah. I'm really pretty proud of it. I do this every morning. Uh, so I'm translating, uh, like long dialogue by the Syrian poet that's called sex poetry in the revolution and it is bad ass. But other than that, I, I think I'm actually going into that lake time where I'm just making like a little blank space. And then at the end of that I'll probably be back doing a bunch of journalism for vice doing stuff on prisons in the Middle East working on my next book project and I don't know, seeing, seeing where life goes cause thing that's so strange about doing a memoir or is it really is like sectioning off at chapter six section off, you know, 15 years of your life and then you've taken all of that and you've put it into this book for him. You've made it into an object and then you go onto what's next. And I, I guess while I have the vague contours of that in my head, part of me just wants to do nothing for awhile and then the plan will come to me.

Speaker 2:          02:03:17       I think that's a great idea. I'm, I'm thinking the same thing about my own life right now. I think I'm too involved and too many different things and I could use a reset, like a calming as to, I think you get that. It's all good stuff and that's the problem and I think that's what you're experiencing as well. Like, you have so many cool things you have going on. Awesome. I feel so lucky. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:03:40       But it's, but if there's no space, I mean can absorb them. Yeah. It's like that, that Louis C K thing about like never being bored, you know? I mean I have that in the best of all possible ways. I have like so many cool opportunities, but if you never have like any, any time to like be bored or be down, you're just like bouncing from thing to thing and yeah, I think, yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:04:00       Louis C K thing about never being born. I'm not aware of it.

Speaker 1:          02:04:03       Uh, it was like a monologue that he had a, about where he was saying that since we have smartphones, basically we just, right now I remember it. Yeah. So you never had like any space to feel anything or to, or to be bored. And so you're just always in a state of distraction. And I think it can be like that with work stuff too. So after that, probably just probably just doing a bunch of journalism stuff. I work a lot with a really cool, I'm Syrian American nonprofit that I'm going to plug here. They're called cutter. I'm foundation and I'm they k a r a m and they do something really cool because a lot attention right now it's on the Syrian refugees that make it to Europe, but they actually work with people who are displaced inside Syria. And then also people like on the border and for the last two years, uh, I've taken part in a program with them where we go down to the schools that are on the border and they bring like, they bring the dentists, the fix all the kids' teeth. They uh, bring up I doctors that get all the kids glasses that need it, but then they also bring like writers and philosophers and architects and like, you know, people who teach classes with the kids. And I was a, I always do murals there. I've done murals in two schools now and so next spring I'll probably be back with them a painting, lots of rebellious cats all over a school in southeast Turkey.

Speaker 5:          02:05:18       Wow. You live such a low ball, broad and fascinating life. I mean you've had so many really intense experiences and and, and all over the place, like about both, all the place professionally and creatively. And then geographically there's so much going on. Like you, you, you're not living a boring life.

Speaker 1:          02:05:41       No, I feel so lucky. I mean that's why it's so hard for me to be, I need to take a reset because it's like the whole world is so big and cool and I love so many things in it.

Speaker 5:          02:05:49       Yeah. But I think, I think your instincts are correct though. He's just, it seems to me like you're just, you've got so much going on all the time. Constantly in so many different arenas.

Speaker 1:          02:06:00       Yeah. It's, it's a lot. But I don't know. Must be, it must be the same with you too. I mean like you d ina, you do comedy, you do this like super like thoughtful talk thing. Do you like host MMA stuff? You mean you've done like so many fucking things and I mean it's just cause like I feel perhaps you feel this way. Like the world is just so big and weird and interesting and like I just want to like learn stuff.

Speaker 5:          02:06:20       Yeah. I wish I could live 10 different lives simultaneously and have a bunch of different careers that I'd be interested in. Same. Same. Exactly. But it's like to do any of those things correctly requires so much attention and focus. It's almost like you can't, you can enjoy too many things cause you then the one thing that you enjoy the most or that you choose to enjoy the most, he really can't focus on it correctly

Speaker 1:          02:06:44       or else you just never ever, ever have downtime ever.

Speaker 5:          02:06:47       Yeah, I'm close to that. I get close to that sometimes but it's not good. But it's weird because like my non downtime seems very recreational.

Speaker 1:          02:06:56       Yeah. Yeah. It's like, it's Super Fun. Like I don't want to like complain like wow, I get to travel all over the world and meet fascinating people in Confront Bastards Boohoo for me. And yet he didn't, you know, it at a certain, at a certain point,

Speaker 5:          02:07:11       you know, um, this is a big compliment, but I'm a, and I don't mean this in terms of an imitation, but your, your drawing of trump and Ivanka was very ralph steadman s

Speaker 1:          02:07:23       oh, I idolize that guy. I love him. No, that's it. That's a massive compliment. Like I think that man is like a God amongst men.

Speaker 5:          02:07:29       He's a bad motherfucker for sure. But that image is just so much like, I think of it as like a, the Kentucky Derby is decadent. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:07:39       Monster like toad people. Oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:07:41       I've got that on framed on my wall, my office, a print from a stubbins illustration of the Kentucky Derby.

Speaker 4:          02:07:48       Cool. Have you ever had, have you ever like had him on the shower? Do you want to get to Kenya?

Speaker 5:          02:07:51       I would love to. I mean, I don't know if he's ever in Los Angeles, but I prefer to do these things in person. But if he's ever here, I would love to have much to talk to him about a hunter and what it looks like and what does last at for time hundred dose and with acid.

Speaker 4:          02:08:05       Oh, when they, when they went to, when they went to the rumble in the jungle and hunter like sold their tickets and, and he was like drawing and off the TV screen.

Speaker 5:          02:08:13       Yeah, he was swimming in the pool and he totally fucked the whole story up because he thought that one was going to kill Muhammad Ali and he didn't want to see it. So you put a Richard Nixon mask on and swam around the yeah, the bull. He to this day over, well not to this day, obviously he's dead but considered that one of his biggest journalistic failures and he went into a giant slump after he did that because like he realized that his decadence and his indulgence had actually gotten in the way of an amazing moment in history. God just to realize like the fucking like beautiful beast that like you rode to being who you were. Like it was turning around and like becoming like a sort of cliche that was fucking up everything. You liked it. Well that's what the, did you ever see the uh, Alex Gibney movie?

Speaker 5:          02:08:56       Uh, Gonzo? The life and times of Dr. Hunter is fucking incredible. It's so good. It's such a good documentary. But that was almost like initially that's how they started the movie off. He started the movie off explaining that at the end of his life, hunter had really stopped being creative. The writing wasn't there anymore. The things that he wrote were like really a middling, they weren't that good. And it was because his indulgences and his excesses had really cooked his brain and he just had, he had become almost a caricature of himself. And along the lines, some of the interviews they had found him when he was a younger man and when he had started to become famous and he was actually worried about that very thing. You were saying like, I, I can't even get out of my own way anymore. And they don't even necessarily, when I'm, when I'm doing these things, I can't tell whether or not they want me and they want my take on things or whether they want the reality itself like an I, I'm, he goes, it's almost, it would almost be better if I died like for my own work.

Speaker 5:          02:10:03       And that was like, wow, this guy is like experiencing like a really early version of both. Also very rare that a journalist's becomes that famous. So, so rare, so rare. But I mean I think the problem was that he, at a certain point he stopped growing and changing and pushing himself and it was just more comfortable to like stay in the mask. Yeah, no doubt. Yeah. I think, um, and also the indulgences and the substances became not just a habit but a physical addiction. And at that point in time, he's more of a slave to that than he is. Even though the work itself and the work itself is almost like something that he's eventually going to get to. I'll get to that eventually. I'll get to that. But it's just cocaine and we read off a list when Lance Armstrong was here yesterday of a typical day in the life of hunter s Thompson as far as, oh God.

Speaker 5:          02:10:54       Yeah. It just starts with like massive. What it does it start with like ether or coke. What does it start with? Starts with a sh. It's like chivas regal cocaine. Dunhill cigarettes, cocaine. Chivas. Regal caught me like we read it all off. It's fucking preposterous. Like you should be fucking dead. And then it says at midnight, hunter s Thompson is ready to write and this is like after getting up at three God, you spend your entire time like pouring liquids into your head and then smoking things. But for a while it worked. Man. He wrote some insane shit during that time. He wrote some amazing stuff for, it's almost like he just red lined his brain, never changed the oil and kept the metal ground down. I got it. Be Boring and I got to go. I'm really sorry to hear. All right, well thank you. No please. No worries. Thank you so much for coming on. And everybody drawing blood is the book.
