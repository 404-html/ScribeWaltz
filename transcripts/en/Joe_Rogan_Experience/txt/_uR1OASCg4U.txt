Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Turn on the lava lamp. He knows how to turn it on. Everything. His name is young Jamie. Three, two, one. I'm live with Nick Swardson, former drug dealer. Tell us your tale. Tell us your tale of. Of Youth Gone Wild. It's a tale of youth gone wild. Wild. How many people like broke windows? Because they heard that song, but like wild. Finally somebody labeled at we use in songs could be inspiring in a bad way sometimes. Right? Get you to do some stupid shit. Did you know any people carelessly whispered? I know fucking careless. Do how many people woke people up before they woke them up? They were not ready to go. They weren't planning on going solo cod. Yeah. I'm going to host a lot of fucking people this year. When you stop and think about George Michael Prince, who is the latest one? There was some big one in Lincoln Park.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       Chester Bennington. This task faster. That was a big one. And Chris Cornell both in the same way. Yeah. And then he committed suicide on his birthday to birthday do. Yeah. That was a really. That was a weird one, man, that guy was 41 on top of the world, the lead singer, one of the biggest rock bands of all time, but it's hard to say like what caused him to be so fucked up, but most people point to he was very sexually abused when he was a young kid and that just, he never, he just never recovered from that. And then, you know. Yeah, I never knew him, but I had friends that are really close to them and they just said he was the most gentle, sweet guy. Fucking powerful voicemail. Shred. Powerful. Yeah. No, it's horrible. It's so hard for people to understand that you could be the lead singer of like, I mean, arguably one of the biggest bands of our generation.

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       Yeah. Giant, huge arena filled up. There was a photo of him standing on stage with no shirt on and this massive arena show and everybody had their cell phone lights on. You know, people do that now instead of lighters. I was a kid when I was a boy. We didn't have cell phone. We burned bodies. We had fire and we had fucking fire hazard, but he was, um, he was standing on stage and I was like, yeah, that's the photo. Like, look at that Shit, man. That's no one could ever possibly imagine that that guy would not be insanely happy. I mean, look how many people love that guy. You, you're just getting a tiny fraction of the love that guy must've gotten and it still wasn't enough. Yeah. So hard to understand. I mean, yeah, that level of just in her sadness and darkness.

Speaker 1:          00:02:42       Good Lord. It's just awful to think of. That guy went through to get to that point and he had six kids. Yeah. So I mean, it's just like, it had to be so much that even having kids and being with his kids wasn't enough. Fuck man, that's a crazy picture though. That's a sick photo. Oh, mine. All the way up in the rafters. Yeah, I mean that's probably like 30,000 people or something crazy. Yeah. Well look at all the people that don't have phones. Yeah. What's their deal? Losers. Maybe they're just cheap mirror. They're like, Ari, like maybe they just went flip phone. I can't handle it, can't handle the APPS. It's just too much. Too much temptation. Always resisting and he's going to be chopping his own. Would soon are, he's going to have a. well, I guarantee you. He told me you wanted to buy land and I was like, do you want to like build a house?

Speaker 1:          00:03:32       He goes, no, no, no, just want to camp there. I was like, what? Buy Land to camp on. He's going to buy like land, but he's not going to build a house like land land or like camping. He's kids. Was that. They were calling it glamping, which is camping with them. It was him. Big Jay Oakerson. Big J posted on his instagram page, but he loves being outside. He loves nature. They just. I mean, I get it. Look if you can camp, if you really don't need a house, what do you need? Do you need a trailer to keep your shit in? Like a trailer to put pots and pans and if. Yeah, if you still want shit. You know what I mean? You can't, can't have posters anymore, but yeah. No poster template. Farrah Fawcett on the roof of your tent. Youth Gone Wild poster up.

Speaker 1:          00:04:21       Yeah. How many fucking go camping? Why do you have to like buy that's outside camping. If you're. If you own a plot of land and then you're just sleeping on it, is that technically camping? That's a very good point. That's sleeping on your land. That's like if you're hunting and there's a fence around the animals and you're only on one acre. Exactly. Is that really hunting? Fucking hunting. Just chasing down shit that can't run away. Yeah. Yeah. You're feeling you're not camping. No. Bears are going to just wander up by your campsite. Nope. That's part of the thrill of being a camper. You're out there for real in the wild. Yeah. You can't be on your own little land unless your land is huge, but then if you land it's huge and yet it's like say if you have like one of those ranches in Texas, you know, Texas is like something insane.

Speaker 1:          00:05:05       Amount of Texas is private land. It's not a lot of public land in Texas. It's just all giant ranches and some of them are like 10,000 plus acres, like twenty thousand one hundred thousand. Like you could camp there I guess because it takes you like three hours to drive across it. That's weird. He had drove to your house. That's too much land too much, right? It's too much. Why do you need that much land? How about Ted Turner? Doesn't that guy owns the most land of anybody in the country here today? King ranch sprawls 825,000 acres of South Texas. Land an area larger than the state of Rhode Island. Oh my gosh. Are you kidding me? As the home of 35,000 cattle and over 200 quarter horses, king ranch, one of the largest ranches in the world today. I wonder if they hunt on that ranch. Who? Which king? Some fucking baller. He might as well be a case King of Rhode Island. Burger King.

Speaker 2:          00:05:59       Maybe it's a burger king guy. Isn't sane man. That is insane. No gay bars. I get this three or four in there for sure. It would be amazing. No gay bars, but there's plenty of truck stops. Rest stops are like where they're at now. They haven't really gotten to the full on gay bar, not full admittance. They just wanted to meet at the rest stops when we were kids. That was like the thing like you'd always know. The dudes would try to bang dudes at arrest a hundred percent. Like if you're at a rest stop and someone knocks on your door and it's a dude. He's looking to get a blow job. Just no rest there. Nobody's resting. You're wide awake and in your mouth they figure out to meet at rest up. So I've always wondered like how does that work? CB radio, breaker breaker one nine. I'm looking to suck some Dick. Anybody out there hollaback? Sixty nine or 69 or come on and rigor. Rigor. One night I like to make bathroom smell of Shit excites me over.

Speaker 2:          00:07:05       Was it a senator or whatever the politician was. The gentleman who got arrested in a sting operation because so many dudes were sucking dicks in the bathroom at the airport in Minneapolis where I'm from. Yeah. Then people called me about it. I was like, what the fuck? I don't know. Hey Man, what's the airport? What's the stole? Was it how many taps? It'd be so many people that they actually went and put a cop there to try to bus people. I mean, how many people have to get their dick sucked in a place before they hire a cop? We found a hotspot. So here it is. Senator pleaded guilty reportedly after bathroom stall incident. That's Minneapolis St Paul Airport. Yeah. And he was, uh, he was like tapping on the ground. They had a way a dad that was a tap move. Yeah. Okay. What is, he said at the time of the incident incident, I complained to the police.

Speaker 2:          00:08:03       They were misconstrue my actions. I was not involved in any inappropriate conduct. He said I should have had the advice of counsel and resolving this matter in hindsight, I should not have pled guilty. I was trying to handle this matter myself quickly and expeditiously get it. And I travel wearing tap shoes. See, part of me thinks it's hilarious, but part of me is sad that this guy has to like hide what he's into and he has to hide in bathroom stalls and learn some fucking secret tap and just smell farts from around the world as he's coming. According to the report cited by roll call, Craig tapped his right foot, which the officer said he recognized as a signal used by persons wishing to engage in lewd conduct. But what if you were there and you just tapping your foot? Yeah. What if you're just impatient because your shit's taking other stuff next.

Speaker 2:          00:08:51       Oh, he also then entered the stall next door and block the door with his luggage. Oh Gee. What does that. How does P, other people get in then? Oh my God, I was in there with somebody. He was trying to block anybody from coming in. Oh my God. He must've been just going to town on guys and then airport. That was the spot and people are kicking trying to kick in the door. What was happening there? I got it, but how does it like. How does a spot become notorious? Like how does arrested, what does it say? Proceeded to swipe his hand under the stall divider several times. I want to know what the fuck was. The cop was saying, if he was like, stop. I can't do it. I can't Tuck your tick here. We don't know what the cop was saying. The cop was totally leading him on. I mean it sounded like he had the green light. Unless the guy's a total psychopath. When you go into a stall with another dude and you stack up your luggage in front of the door, that's a bold move. It's weird. It seems like you would only do that if you were emboldened. Didn't just tap his foot. He touched the officer's foot with his foot. He reached his foot all the way under. Here's my question. We know cops are full of Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:09:58       All right. Just like people. People full shit. Put cops are people. Not all cops. A lot of cops are awesome. We know some cops are full of shit. Like when when something like this happens, I feel like that's one person versus another person. I don't really feel like a cop's word is worth more than a regular person's word because I think a cop was just a regular person. I think you should listen to them when they're doing the job, but something like this, it might've been exactly as this cop described, but it might've been like that Baltimore cop that got busted planting drugs with his fucking camera had a body camera on, and what he didn't understand is when you turn on a body camera, it records 30 seconds before you turned it on, so just in case you turn it on in a moment of duress was something crazy is going on. You're like, shit, the camera and you present on vacancy. Someone committing a crime, perhaps you have a 32nd buffer. I didn't know that. He didn't know that either. Dude. So they got on video, 30 seconds of him going back in planting the drugs that he then pretended to.

Speaker 2:          00:10:53       Oh fine. Oh my God. That's horrifying. Horrible. Fucking horrifying,

Speaker 3:          00:10:59       horrible. See? Because if you're gonna be able to convict somebody on, this guy says this and that guy says that, and who do you believe? I believe the copies an officer of the law. That's crazy because it's just a person and this is not a disrespectful thing. It's cops. I'm not, I'm not a disrespectful person, but the amount of power is a scary amount of power and it's just a person. Now, some people like I have a bunch of friends are cops and they know how to handle it. You know, they've handled it and they've, they, they get it, they know what it is and they're real cool about it. Like big John McCarthy, the ref for the UFC. He's one of the best examples. Big John is a. He was a serious cop in, involved in some fucking hairy shit for years. One of the nicest guys you ever want to meet and totally fair and reasonable guy.

Speaker 3:          00:11:42       And he was the guy, you know, that was like a bright and shining example of what a cop could be. And if the world is filled with big John McCarthy's as cops, it'd be a wonderful place and I think we all figured out, but cops are just people, men, especially when these cops are going into these situations, like imagine me in a 21 year old guy or however the fuck old you are, and all of a sudden you're working in Camden, New Jersey. I get the fuck Outta here. You're not ready for that. You're saying regular dude and you're going to get thrust into some chaotic, almost semi war zone in some of these bad neighborhoods. These people have to patrol. Yeah. And just another world with another set of rules and just shit. Just going down and you're coming up on is most likely a threat to your life.

Speaker 3:          00:12:28       You pull a guy over, like you pulled a guy over in a 65 impala. What are the odds that guy doesn't have a gun, right? You see like one of them low rider cars and you see some, some gangster look and fellows with some crazy face tattoos and shit and they're driving those cars. Can you imagine having to pull over someone who you knew was probably willing to shoot you and you have to talk to them about their brake light being off or they were five miles an hour above the speed limit. You, you know the videos, you've seen videos of cops getting shot. We have, you know that that could happen. You around. People just lying all the time. They're all lying. Yeah. How many of them are telling the truth? They talked to you. Ninety percent fellowship. Ninety percent. So every day it's just true

Speaker 4:          00:13:10       panic. I mean like when I would get pulled over, I mean like I panicked. I fucking like, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:13:15       that cop, that shot, that chick, the recent one where the woman called in Minnesota. Yeah. She called for the police and then she came out and when she came out the cops shot her. That to me is the perfect example of why we should reassess what a cop is and reassess like how many people get to be cops. It's an extraordinary responsibility you're putting on just any person, an ordinary person. I would say. I think you have to be an extraordinary person to be a good cop for sure. You also have to deal with the fact that there's been a lot of bad cops and there's a lot of prejudice against cops. It was like two giant factors, but I think that job where you decide whether or not you pull the trigger and end someone's life and you're a panicker. You know you're a panicker.

Speaker 3:          00:14:06       You're not a. you're not a guy who does well in, in confrontational situations. Maybe you haven't been in a lot of conflicts. Maybe you've seen too much shit. Maybe seen too many people get shot. Maybe you're suffering from PTSD. Maybe you're on edge all the time. Maybe you have nightmares that someone's going to take you out and then all sudden you're in the hallway and this lady comes out or an alleyway and shoot her and you're like, what the fuck? Like you. You might not even saw her. You know, people have hallucinations under great duress, like when they think their life is on the line, they see things that aren't really there. It happens to people all the time. They'll, they'll mistake someone for something else. The mistake someone for an attacker.

Speaker 4:          00:14:40       I mean, that's fucking insane. I mean she called the cops crazy. That's what's fucking insane to call nine one one because she heard what she thought was a woman being assaulted and then approach a cop car

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       and they get fucking shot phrasing. I mean like what? But it's what it is, is people not handling pressure very well. Pressure is, it's. It is such a massive factor in the way people behave and there's no bigger pressure than you showing up. You have bright shiny lights. You're in the enemy car. Okay. You were in the NMP enemy uniform and they know you have a gun. And how many of them have watched so many videos on tv of cops planting evidence on Youtube of cops planting evidence of kids being shot by cops and stores were cops got shot in the back. I mean like crazy shit. So you're dealing with the weight of that when you step out of your car. Yeah, I mean that's the anxiety. Twenty four slash seven. That's a job that is insanely hard to do and we should, we should figure out a way to reengineer that position.

Speaker 1:          00:15:44       We should figure out a way to give them more help, more support and explain like, like the, the only way like cops and civilians are going to get along is if there's no fuck ups or very, very few fuck ups. Like anytime something like this happens, you realize you got to realize like you got a bad system. Like the system is. You can't have just a regular person and give them a gun kind of psychological training. Do they have. Have you seen what they're. What they're like, how did they get the Gig? If you seen what they're like under the gun. Have you seen what they're like when someone wants to beat their ass? Have you seen what they're like when someone is throwing punches at him, trying to kill them? Some guy randomly, right? He answers a call. He opens a door, guys throwing bombs at them.

Speaker 1:          00:16:24       How does he, what does he do? How does he handle this? Does he shoot the guy? Does he run away? Can you fight back? Has He ever been punched? Right. Fuck man. You're asking some regular person to just be involved in it potential like civilian warzone on any given day, like if you're in Miami, Florida and someone gunshots fired in a warehouse. So like, what are the odds? These guys don't have like piles of cocaine in his warehouse machine. I've seen narchos come on, man. Well that's the thing. It's like you've never seen a mellow cop movie. There was no like, chill movie where it's like, alright, yeah, you got a speeding ticket and then did today and then the end is fucking nuts except smoking the bandit. It's pretty proven. Then they drove recklessly. Do nobody around. Yeah, I mean nobody to hit. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:17:12       I have a question for you. Okay. What is this I hear about, um, your dream pills? The pills. Somebody said that you approached your Alpha brain. It's a nootropic what it is, it's actually nutrients that are building blocks for human neurotransmitters, like certain foods that are called, or I'm saying foods because you eat them. It's their supplements, mostly vitamins and minerals and a bunch of different things that you can get from plants and there's a series of different kinds of nootropics and if you've never looked into it, it's a cool thing to study. There's actually supplements out there that enhance

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       your memory and they enhance your reaction time as well, like, well, you know, how you feel like if you're hung over or you wouldn't even understand what this is, such a man of health never drank, but that feeling where you're like kind of foggy, like cut or some days you just kind of. It's not firing, right? So we know for sure this is really obvious to everybody that there's a difference in your performance based on a variety of factors, right? Right. Lack of sleep, nutrition, exercise, stress. There's a whole host of factors that affect how your brain forms nootropics. What they can do is boost up your brain's ability to remember things like verbal memory is a big one that they show. And we did two double blind placebo controlled studies about Alpha brain. That's one of the things we found. We found, um, memory reaction time and peak alpha flow state all improvements and all like statistically significant improvements in those areas.

Speaker 3:          00:18:50       So what I've found is a, uh, there was a company called neuro. One is the supplement. I forget his company, but it's Bill Roman, you know bill very well. Yeah. That guy is Jesus. John Savage, savage as a football player, super savage. And remember we're going to talk about the new cte study that just came out. It's crazy with football players, but anyway, Bill Roman [inaudible], he used to be friends with this dude Sarah and no name and no name was, uh, that were cool radio station in San Francisco. Still love doing them and I'm no name was friends with Roman asking romanesque. He was training him. He was like, he was like trying to get him in shape. It's like, come on you fuck, I'm going to work you out. And you put them through a bunch of brutal workouts. And then he gave him some of his supplement and that's how I found out about it.

Speaker 3:          00:19:36       And to supplement neuro one he invented because he was suffering from head injuries because he had been so many concussions, man, he's having memory problems and all sorts of issues. So he started looking into um, nutritional cures like what, what helps boost neurotransmitters, which helps boost serotonin. There's, there's like five htp is a big one that helps boost serotonin and l trip to fan as well because El Tryptofan actually converts to a five htp and then you have to add in a bunch of other shit like adaptogens and b vitamins and all these different things. Like there's a combination that you can hit of, of nutrients and Bill Romanowski uses. I think he used a little caffeine in his as well. Anything to do with him by the way. This is not an advertisement. We don't sell neuro one, but it's the shit. It's really good. And that's, that's the first thing I found out about it, found out about that. And then we wound up making Alpha brain, which is our version of it with a bunch of things at work together synergistically. And um, if you take that stuff before bedtime, a lot of times you get freaky dreams. Like if you take it like an hour before bedtime, like right. It seems to like, right when you go to sleep, you know, that's when it's just getting into your system. And I guess when you go into your rem

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       sleep, you get an extra fucking fat, juicy pipe of neurotransmitters to work when you started having freaky ass dream. There's this full inception. Yeah, of a Paratha. Tim is really good too. People love that stuff. Love that. Coleen Coleen is a big one. That's one of the ingredients, the lucky charms. I definitely am lucky charm. They should be. People will be like times made me very smart today. They're basically, you know, their nutrients. Yeah. No, that's a trip. No, I was just super skeptical about this. And you definitely should be. You definitely should be. I would never ever in a million years try to sell someone something that doesn't work. I would have zero desire and doing that. So everything that we do it on it, I use. Yeah, I use I or I believe in it. It's like there's nothing. There's no horseshit thing, so when this whole new tropics thing came out, we like, we rushed and Got Alpha brain out and a lot of people call bullshit.

Speaker 2:          00:21:44       They're like, they're like, there's no studies. No science is a snake oil. I was like, Oh, you got to have like all your ducks in a row. You start claiming that you have nutrient regardless of whatever anecdotal evidence you have good learning, but I mean that's weird because people never just cry bullshit over stuff for no reason. People never just go, what? No, fuck that. It's like everything that. Everything that happens. What I saw Katie Perry sitting down with Deray Mckesson, mckesson or Mac doesn't have a black lives matter and Katy Perry was apologizing about cultural appropriation because I guess she wore braids for whatever fucking reason and she was sitting there is the weirdest thing ever. Man, they're both on a couch and they have no shoes on and she's touching him and he's wearing a blue vest. I was like, what the fuck am I watching?

Speaker 2:          00:22:33       Was that in the dream or was that a real look? Look, here's the thing, dude wears that blue vest everywhere. I mean, he loves that blue vest that says, look, you know what I'm saying? It's like Mr Rogers, Mr Rogers, first of all, to get the socks. I love socks. Strong. Confident man. Are they in the Matrix? Those socks are rainbows, homie. What bitch colors there? And so she's culturally appropriating a lesbian right now with her hair. She should be careful. She's culturally appropriating. Literally an old lesbian. She Re hipster an insane asylum that there. And that's her bathroom where she shits that uh, that picture on the wall. It comes down and she climbs on top and shits in the mouth. Oh my, uh, yeah. It's crazy. It's a new thing. It's a new thing. All the celebrities are doing like, look how they're sitting here facing each other. It's so bizarre. I can't play any of this because I don't want to get the video pulled off youtube. But uh, it's mostly, it's him sitting there listening to her just go like this. Coming out of her barfing, she just didn't want people to be mad at her for doing. For wearing braids. Yeah, for for cultural outrage. Let's see what she looked like when she was culturally appropriate and cultural appropriation is

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       so crazy. The idea that you can't have braids if you're white. Oh my God. Do people just trying to control people. They're trying to control people whether they're fucking two cents. Everybody wants to throw in and chime in. Yeah. It's just everywhere. Everybody wants to be like, oh no, no, no, no. I got. I have something to say. It's like, all right, well, and everybody wants to be able to be mad. They want to have a reason to get mad. Yeah. We talked about that earlier. Everybody wants to be Super Superman. Yeah. We were talking about the behind the scenes stuff at shows and about how many different mindsets you have to kind of manage when you're working on a show and how many people were just looking. You get outraged about stuff. Especially lately. It's so. It's a weird fucking time for this. Yeah. No, you cannot have choke.

Speaker 4:          00:24:29       I mean, I, I sent out like loose cannon tweets sometimes, then I would do it more back in the day and then I just liked the more I, you know, you get shit faced and then like write a tweet and I'm like, I just, I don't want to deal with what somehow somebody could even. I mean even like innocuous, harmless instagrams and stuff, people will still like jump on them and be like, Hey, I saw this bird. And they're like, well what's the kind of bird is a, well, what did you fuck it? Or I don't know what I mean. Like, well you hit it on the brim out. I decided to it. Don't you think though that for the most part, most of the interactions are pretty nice. There's just a snip of the most. Yeah, right. There's a small but those small percentage you don't forget.

Speaker 4:          00:25:10       No, and it's, it's just, I mean it's the ones that are really irrational and the ones that always make me laugh for people, it'll go like they'll comment or something and I don't really read comments like an uber on a plane or something and I'll just like, oh, I'll see you check out the comments. Some will be like, hey, fuck you, you're a piece of shit. I'm like, all right, like it. And then they'll come back like, can't believe you like that. Like I was just kidding. Like I'm a huge fan and I'm just like, well this is just weird for me because you're just sending it. You just wrote a whole thing about hi, I'm a piece of shit and I just liked it and the night you're like, Nah, I just, I just want to get you to respond. Yeah. From their perspective, like that's the best way to get them to respond.

Speaker 4:          00:25:46       Like that's the best way. Like that way you know, you'll, you'll be, you'll have your back up against the wall. Well, it's like you said, it's like when a lot of this stuff's positive and then the ones that pop or the people that are like, hey, you're fucking fist sucks. You know what I mean? That's so rude. Which, uh, does your face does not suck. It's dce dude, you're fine. This fifth. Listen, there's a lot of people out there with some fucked up faces that would kill for your face book. But no, I was saying about dreams I would have like when I would detox from like a fucking booze extravaganza and I went out of dreams. That's why I was intrigued because I would have fucking crazy dreams where I would be. It would be so lucid. I went here, riders on the storm right now I can say some stuff that was like a, like a mixed version elevator on mushrooms, like Dj version.

Speaker 4:          00:26:39       So you detox detox. I would have these dreams and there were so loose. I'd be like walking around the dream and I'd be. And I knew it. No, I was dreaming and I couldn't wake myself up and I would try to wake myself up. So then I would try to like jump dive out of a window to wake myself up or try to like do something that will like jar me awake and then I would do it and then I would wake up and then I would be in another fucking dream to not be in my bedroom. And I'd be like, Oh, I'm going to go up and get some water. And then all of a sudden realize, oh my God, I'm still in the dream because this isn't the shit on my walls. And I'd have to wake myself up again. Fucking gnarly dude. Like you psyched yourself out in the dream. Wake up like, Hey, wake up. Wake up. Oh look, you're awake. Know who does really just more dream your wicks.

Speaker 4:          00:27:26       Yeah. So it. So it was kind of fascinated by that. It makes you wonder what is real. If you could live in a perpetual dream, what's going on there? You still, there's something happening. You're experiencing things. It's things are happening. Whether you're lying there with your eyes closed or not, there's a bunch of shit that's going on. A bunch of experiences that your senses are taken in that are pretty fucking remarkably similar to real life. Right? Like that's why it's so crazy because it feels real. Right. That's why dreams like especially lucid dreams trip you out because it feels real. It feels real. But I liked it like when you dream like a really weird dream, you just accept the reality of like, like when I remember a drag I'll be like, yeah, I just totally was in the stream of just accepted that I was like riding a rabbit, you know what I mean? Like over a fucking skyscraper to like Save Katy Perry's face or something. You know, we totally accept them. Like what I'm doing.

Speaker 3:          00:28:19       Look at that fucking beard, that Fabulous Morrison and people didn't have beards back then either when he had. He grew this beard. The video is him in a fucking beautiful old mustang being a bad motherfucker.

Speaker 4:          00:28:32       Yeah. Beards were like considered rogue back then. Oh yeah, he was. He was this rogue because it came, man. He used to post Dick on stage, went to jail for it. He's driving to the Tempe Improv right there. I remember that he was going to go see joey. How do we know

Speaker 3:          00:28:48       what really goes on when you're asleep for eight hours? How do we know when you're out cold? When you call you're out, right? How the fuck do we know what's actually happening? What's going on in these this dream states? Because you only remember a fraction of the time you're out, right? There's a fraction of the time would have dreams aren't fake. What if they're just some alternative reality that you occasionally intermingle with when you're conscious or unconscious rather like when you go into a dream state, maybe that's just like the shadow of something that just happened that was real. Maybe you have like these these moments that seemed like eight hours to you or five hours to you, but you're really interfacing with some completely different timeline and some completely different reality and the world is pliable. It's not locked down like rocks aren't rocks and water isn't water, but everything's fluid and changing constantly and that's why when you're in these dreams, you freak out because all of a sudden like the physics of reality are gone to Napa and do it.

Speaker 3:          00:29:51       Maybe there might be a war. Look, just the fact that this world exists in the state that it exists in this world is very, very bizarre. If it wasn't real like the. This reality wasn't real. If we all lived in some sort of a black and white print version of life and then you got to experience the life that you and I know that students stand up and being in La and flying and planes and using the Internet and experiencing life in the 21st century in 2017, you would be like, this is the craziest psychedelic trip. If you went to Time Square, you would never. You'd never experienced anything like human culture and you went to Time Square. You would be for wreaking the fuck out. Yeah, that'd be insane. It would be insane. We're just so used to it. We're so used to it. We don't realize how bizarre the actual world is.

Speaker 3:          00:30:42       Well, yeah, I mean it's possible that these dream worlds, that these are just different worlds that you tap into when you conk out every night is a different world. B could be infinite, could be you're running a series of lives like you have multiple lives going on and your decisions you make in this conscious life affect all of them and maybe you have other lives when you're asleep that are conscious when you're awake, but much like you're asleep and you don't remember what the fuck is going on when they're asleep, they don't remember what the fuck is going on and you interface. You might not just be nick swardson stand up comedian. You might be an entity that interfaces with multiple different dimensions in the night and you just don't remember it. Just like you don't remember sleeping right? You don't remember dreaming. You don't remember a lot of shit that happens when you're conked out for eight hours, right?

Speaker 3:          00:31:30       Well, they probably don't remember. When you're awake and you're, you're interfacing, you're not just shutting off like your. Your brain wants to. Everything needs to shut off so that your other self in this other dimension can interact and can go about its its world and maybe eight hours to it as a month or a week to us, we don't even fucking know. Maybe that's a huge important part of being a person is that other world has to, has to coincide with it. Maybe that's why Michael Jackson died because they gave him that shit that knocked him out. That didn't. You don't dream under that shit. They would basically put them under anesthesia every night and he wouldn't get to interface with the other world. Alright. I gotta go.

Speaker 4:          00:32:14       No, you never know. I'm fascinated. I'm fascinated by dreams. They fucking are weird man. But I mean, yeah, the. Maybe they do mean something. Maybe there's another most likely not. I mean I'm just covered in spiders and screening. I think that's basically. Well you can let her roll your workout stuff in your dream sometimes, like you'll experience that workout stuff, but I don't. I don't work out every names. I never go to the gym and dreams. That's a good. I've never fucking

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       ever worked out and in a dream have never done that either. That's fucking crazy. I used to throw kicks in my dreams. I used to like when I was young, but especially like girlfriends would complain. I would like twitch. I would like literally like throw a kick. I remember when bill permit jokes about it, like sounded like a Bruce Bruce springsteen song throwing kicks in the night. It was like an old ice house chronicles. We went on a whole rant about it. That's really interesting. Springsteen, a lot of guys have that problem. Like fighters have that problem. Dude, my fucking old roommate in New York, we couldn't wake him up. You had to, you had to like throw something at them from across the room and then hide because he. Because he would wake up in an immediate Malay. It was immediately like game time and we thought we found out the hard way.

Speaker 2:          00:33:29       We were like, Hey, wake up. Then it was just thing they name and it was just like he would just even take him like fucking like 15 seconds to like, come back down. Oh my God. Yeah, so I dunno what every day. Alternate every fucking day. What if an alarm clock woke him up? He wakes up swinging or no, that has be a person. It would have to be a person's. Why? Just put an alarm clock next to him will. You couldn't afford it. We were the alarm clock, the bloody alarm clock. Some people don't like to be woken up, man and they get super mad at you and the other people just chill like, Hey, what's up? What's going on and why? You guys waking me up. Hey man, where are you naked? You ever seen someone get knocked out and they ask questions. They think like what's going on here?

Speaker 2:          00:34:11       So it's the weirdest thing. Like what? Where, why are you guys here? Like why are you guys staring out? Right? I've seen it before but I've never. Not in front of me. Dude, it's weird. It's weird to the brain, the human brain when it gets shut off and then comes back on. It's almost like an old windows, 95 computer when it reboots and you see the das thing right now you see the, what is that, that black with a white screen, the boot screen does it dot the dos screen and then it would take a long time to boot up and it'd be all Janky and shit and you wouldn't be able to click on the Internet yet. And it was like when you get claimed, like I imagined football players, it's the same thing, but they oftentimes don't remember shit. They don't remember anything that happened.

Speaker 2:          00:34:54       They might not even remember like getting into the ring. They might not remember any of that. I was gonna say. I mean you've seen so many fighters go through it. Do they? Do they ever remember the knockout? Some of them do, yeah. Some of them remember everything. They remember seeing like, oh fuck. Like that last moment where he's like, he caught me. Yeah. And they're just out. Yeah, they remember getting hit. They'll remember what hit them. Some of them, some of them don't remember anything. That's the thing about brain damage. It's a, it gets completely variable. It's variable, like there's some guys that just, they've been knocked out a ton of times and they're okay. It's weird. Like Alistair overeem is a perfect example. He's been knocked out of gang of times and he's fine like it. At least he appears to be. He's very lucid, very articulate. I mean he's a,

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       he's got his composure but after fights he doesn't, you know, like when you get cracked, like he got knocked out when he fought steep Emile church and this is not his fault and I said after this that I don't think we should interview with fighters anymore after they get knocked out because he said that he thought that Steve Bay tapped. He thought he had the guillotine and steepbank tapped. Right. So he was saying that in the replay. So we had to play the replay back because we didn't know if he was right. I'm like, we'll play it because he was saying this to me while I was interviewing them. That's why. So we played it and you couldn't see the tabby. I think he believed it was just because he just got knocked out. Yeah, that's not a good idea to interview people after they get knocked out.

Speaker 3:          00:36:15       Terrible idea. Terrible. And I've thought it before, but I never, I really, you know, I just felt a felt bad, like I had to play the video because he said that it happened. So if he said that it happened, my job as an interviewer is to play that video. I just expected him to say something along the lines of, you know, I thought I had um, if you could remember the fight, I thought I had him, but he got them. He got me fair play to him, you know, the normal stuff. Give them a chance to represent themselves. So when that was going on I was like, okay, this is not fair. This is like, he's, he just got knocked out cold and there's no way, like three minutes later. Yeah, no way. No Way. And then everybody gets mad at them for that. You know, you can't get mad at someone for that.

Speaker 3:          00:36:56       It's too weird. Yeah. So this study came out today. I'm Brendan Schaub. Send it to me because he's freaking out. It said that. What is it? Something like 97 percent. Okay. That they examined 111 former NFL players. Only one didn't have cte. Wow. Not only that, they found that 87 percent of people who play football at any level had cte. This is what's really crazy. Men who played football at all levels, all levels for like. So I, I assume that's got to mean like high school, including high school. Well, yeah. And who is that guy? Jamie. We talked about this before. Forgive me for not a football fan. I liked football, but just don't know enough about it. Who is that guy that jumped on the car? Chris Henry was his name. Yeah. That guy was young and like a super stud athlete. Right. I'd have been like 25, 26, something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:37:51       When they did an autopsy on him, they found out he had severe. CTE was like, this guy's brain is wrecked like pole. See if you could pull that study up because people were super shocked because he was in his prime. Yeah, I mean he was in his prime and he was a super athlete. Yeah, I remember that. I mean you, Jamie, you know a lot about football. What or how much of a bad ass was he a as far as like top wide receivers. It wasn't maybe like in the top 10, but yes, he was. No, he was starting. He was starting to get to come into his own man. He died in a traffic accident, had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Pathi. I always fucked that up. And cephalopathy and sap and sap and Cephalon hmm. That's a sense of apathy and Sepa Apathy, right? Pathi and SEFA law and cephalopathy and cephalopathy.

Speaker 3:          00:38:41       Boom. Oh my God. It's got to be neurosurgeons going crazy right now. Shut the fuck up. You idiot. You can't even pronounce a word. A form of degenerative brain damage caused by multiple hits to the head at the time of his death. According to the scientist had brain injury research center, a research center affiliated with West Virginia University. The guy says in quotes, we would have been very happy if the results have been negative, but multiple areas of Chris Henry's brain showed cte and then they go into details about it. So you gotta think like here's a guy who's in his prime 28 years old, right? Just bad motherfucker and he's not showing any signs of like falling apart and he's got ce cte.

Speaker 4:          00:39:21       It's not scary. Well, I mean it makes you think too. I mean I talked about that. A lot of my friends is I'm a big nfl dude, diehard football fan and we were talking the other day like does, does it continue? I mean like 25 years from now, the rates for a lot of these guys. Well, yeah, but I'm saying like does the NFL, I mean, oh I see what you're saying. Does the NFL continue? I mean at some point these studies and these things are going to come out and it's just gonna be, you know, it's horrifying.

Speaker 3:          00:39:47       Better off fighting. I think you can get knocked out and fighting and you definitely get brain damage and fighting, but I think if you become like a mighty mouse, like if you get to a skill level that very few people get to when you were at a super elite skill level, I think you'd probably take less damage. It's hard to say because there's been some fucking wars with the mighty mouse thing might be a bad example because he's so fucking good. A lot of his fights or just mismatches, you know? It's not like there's another mighty mouse out there that's trying to fuck him. I'm like someone and not everyone can be the mighty mouse, you know what I'm saying? Like it has to be. There's going to be various levels of competency across the board, but like if you could fight the way that guy fights, like he doesn't.

Speaker 3:          00:40:27       He's not a brawler. He's not doing anything stupid. He's not just like biting on his mouthpiece and throwing bombs. He's super technical in his approach. He's a consummate professional and like a strategic wizard and how he approaches interacting with guys who are almost strategically wizard. Although that was caught that though I'm a wizard at all over your tents, um, but what he does is just the, probably the safest way to do it, the smartest way to do it because he's just so competent it, he's not getting hit and he's his, his, his tactics are so clever and so skillful that he's able to like avoid a lot of like big bombs that come his way. Football players aren't avoiding shit.

Speaker 4:          00:41:07       Now you're getting hit getting hit. You're getting hit.

Speaker 3:          00:41:10       Like there's no mighty mouse in the football world, right? If you're a linebacker, you're fucking hitting people or hitting you. You're hitting them.

Speaker 4:          00:41:17       If you're on the line, you're not. It's nonstop. I mean to, not just that he's not even getting hit in the head. They're saying doing this, like slamming each other. That stuff jerks your neck and your head and all that stuff. Just the sheer impact. What are you going to sell the. They just started this weekend.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       This is like the pilot, what they're calling the American flag football leagues. So there's like some former NFL players in this. Why don't they just blow guys on the field yet? I don't know if this is going to be interesting to know. Yeah, that's football. That was depressing. Why'd you show that you can't have that? No one that guy knows while he's doing it. The logo put on figure skating, figure skating. We need to get something more manly. Rhythmic gymnastics. I liked their helmets or lack thereof though. I like that. I think that's very smart. Um, you know, we just, there's a rugby helmets. Those are rugby helmets, helmets, the headgear. There's more protect your ears and I'll be going to help them if they had ground maybe. I guess maybe a little bit. I would just wear ear muffs. They used to have those things in.

Speaker 1:          00:42:16       When I competed in the taekwondo days, that guy's got knocked out and one of the real horrible things was that they get kicked in the head knocked out. They usually out cold and their head would bounce off the ground. So depending upon where the fight was taking place, most of the time there was no surface like we would fight like on an actual basketball court. Like there's a video of me fighting on an actual basketball court, you can see the lines on the court, it's solid wood, and then you kick a guy and they'd fall back in their head, would bounce off the off the wood and it was terrible. Like some people got knocked out and it was horrible. So they started making. People were first, it was a head gear that you can just wear on the back of your head literally just to protect you when you get knocked out so that your head didn't bounce off.

Speaker 1:          00:42:57       And then some guys, they started making you. Some guys voluntarily did it. He started making you aware of the bigger all-inclusive helmet. So it's a big foam. Protect it around your head, like the you by football games, like a foam? No, it's like a. You can find it. Pull up a taekwondo head gear. It's like your face is exposed, but like you have like these things to cover your ears and the foam over the protects him head Jerry later. That's what it looks like. That's exactly what it looks like. There's an adidas one, so it's like see how it's got the foam around the ears and the foam on the top of the head. Your face is completely exposed and most. I don't know what that one is. That's not a Friday the 13th. The one you had on his. Perfect. That's a real tech window mass.

Speaker 1:          00:43:39       The white one or the Red One? There's an adidas one. Yeah. So that's in those are world taekwondo federation. Once some of the International Taekwondo Federation ones, those tournaments, a lot of them, they did a differently and they did the fucking stuck old school a lot of times. I remember they still had the, uh, the wood floors and there was no head gear. They, I think they probably change them as time goes on, but they, um, those, those head gears were designed really mostly to protect you when you got knocked out from your head, bounced off the ground. Then they start making people find on pads too. After a while they changed the flooring. I mean, yeah, heads is key. Yeah. It's fucking hard wood. Yeah. It's been the, the being I found on the fucking meant a hockey rink, a hockey rink that didn't have any water in it. They put a tarp down like God, they put a tarp down. We fought on concrete. It was horrible. Why you put tarp down at that

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       point? People get knocked out. Two in one dude who got knocked out. His eyebrow bounced off the, uh, off the concrete. Like, you know, there was basically just like the, whatever the bottom of a ice skating rink would be. You would drink. It was for the bay state games too is a big tournament. It was a big deal because the bay state games or the Olympic festival and it was the first time and I think only time they ever had taekwondo in it. If I, if I were going, I was going to guess, I think I was 19, so it was like 86. So, uh, these guys, yeah. There's one google taekwondo tournament, kids on a hardwood floor. Again, see this might be, it might be a tournament where they spar or it might be a tournament where they. Oh, that looks like they have headgear on the ground, right? They have, they do, they have forums turned out that little red thing, right? Yeah. Those are head gears. What's the bar behind the. I don't know what the fuck that is. Like a float day for a pool. I don't know what that is. That might be, um, a different kind of tournament. It might be a point tournament. I think it's floating, floating to new. It's a new sport that comes to the Dildo whipping.

Speaker 2:          00:45:38       So I was uh, I was thinking about this this past weekend. I was talking to somebody about that Brown bunny movie. We've talked about that movie before that said Vincent Gallo movie where then he was a close 78. Oh, you said it perfect. I've never said it right. Ever. I'm very good at trickle Joe. Seven. Yeah, seven years. Yeah. And we're talking about how that fucked his career for sure. And probably fucked her career for a few years too, right? Yeah. I mean he was so promising to be a lead Gargoyle, but he was weird. Freaky dude freaking fucking out there. I mean, like I had friends that were friends with them years ago and they're like, this dude's just on another planet, you know what I mean? Like, of course. I mean he got his Dick Sucked in a movie for real and he got his dick sucked by a movie star that's not just like getting your Dick sucked.

Speaker 2:          00:46:31       I mean, she's had a really good career though. She's done a bunch of shit since then. Yeah, that was a while ago. So she, um, I don't, I'm out of the loop. So what was, what has she been in fuck? She's one of those chicks it like pops up and she was on an hbo show, but she was on big love feel like I remember a lot of good indie films, but I feel like I remember there was some bad ass to her in the beginning. Am I wrong? She was in kids. Was there first thing? Oh Wow. She wasn't a movie called three needles. That sounds hilarious. Kids heavy. Yeah. Shattered glass is dope. It's just in party monster. Hold on a second. Shit. Jenny and the girl, the main girl, Jenny and forest gump. Forrest gump. Forrest gump. Fucked her on camera. I don't remember. Kids. I just remember it was a chick that got eds. I think so, yeah. Dude fucks her while she's asleep. She's like, don't want to change. Just be casper and she's got aids and the ideas. She gave him aids

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       jokes on you. Screen writers. What was the or what was he telling you? He was in the wire. Everybody's said that I looked like him when I was in high school. I remember that. I was like, great. Click on that. And what year was that movie? Boys don't cry. American psycho. She's done some shit dude. Yeah, but when did all that stuff happened? Like when did the Brown bunny movie happen? No, you just back up. It was right there. Go back the list bro. Right up there. Yeah, there it is. Okay, so you got an academy award winning movie. Boys don't cry. Yeah. Then she's like, time to fuck. No, it looks like time to fuck was before that. No, no Brown bunny. It's fucking after boys don't cry. That's down now it's, it goes lower. I'm going the wrong way. I was thinking the top was the more recent ones.

Speaker 4:          00:48:20       Wow. Yeah. Yeah. That's a crazy choice. So she's still done a bunch of stuff since Brown bunny. She did Zodiac. I mean she was willing to be on big love, but not an agent must be so confused. What do you want to do? He had a real. He had a real backlash. Vincent Gallo, didn't he? I mean I think he's one of those like self imploding dudes. I don't think he was ever really like. He did Buffalo, 66, which is actually a cool movie. She, she never stopped working. So you go 2003, killing it. Yeah. So it didn't impact her negatively. Maybe did. I don't know, but she still worked. But you don't really hear about that dude anymore. And before that movie he was like a. He was a big. He was in Buffalo, 66. Remember that? Yeah. That's a great fucking movie. It just said that.

Speaker 4:          00:49:07       Joe, did you say that? Are you in? So sorry you're in a dream state. I was trying to remember. I was trying to remember what we were just talking about. Yeah. Buffalo 66 is cool. Him and reach. You did. I didn't hear you say that. I feel embarrassed. I wasn't listening to him pray for the cardinal sin of conversation. I was just struggling with my memory. It's ironically enough after telling you about nootropics. Yeah, my four helmet now. I did yoga today. I drained my brain. I'm a 15 percent stupider when I do yoga. I want to get back and doing yoga 15 percent stupid or in what way? For like four or five hours. Just wrecked. Yeah. Hot Yoga like my brain could God my brain cooks. I did that once and then uh, I was like, I'll try it. My sister talked me into it and I was 15 minutes into it and I thought we were done and I was like, all right.

Speaker 4:          00:49:57       And then I got up and I'm like, we have to be done. And the woman was like, no, we have like another 45 minutes. I'm like, well, you fucking do. Like, I, like, I just got out of there. It was so intense. I had done yoga a couple times, I gotten cocky and it was, you know, I really liked yoga, like kind of center me and show me the fuck out, you know, and then I tried the hot shit and it was just not cool man. It was too intense. It's intense. Like you definitely, I was dizzy and. But you know what it is dude, it's not the best if you have to use your brain

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       right afterwards for like really solid, like three or four hours, but it is really good in terms of like overall, like the overall, the overall your health and the way you interface with the world. Way more chilled out if you do it a lot. Yeah. But Shit. So you did it and then just immediately got in your car and then drove away. What else do I do? Stay tent up plot of land. Lump. I should go up in that area. Yeah. I took a shower and got the fuck out of there. Got something to eat. Dinner, shower. I did of course got to sweat. I think there's something really good for your body though that especially that hot one. I think that 104 degrees and stretching out, I just think it makes you more pliable. Definitely makes you more flexible. Like when you're doing it, you can get into positions that you can't get into when you're cold.

Speaker 2:          00:51:20       So that means to me like there's some, there's some sort of a benefit in being like really warm in terms of pliability. The muscle tissue. Yeah, a hundred percent, a hundred percent that settlement questions. I mean it wouldn't be that popular if it weren't, it didn't have some kind of effect. Yeah. Even like, you know, it's like even like getting in any situation when you're cold and stretching or trying to do anything active at the sucks. Sucks. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You can't, you don't perform at your best when it's 80 below zero outside. Yeah. Like I get a massage the other day and it was freezing in the air conditioning on and I stopped the guy and I'm like, what the fuck you doing? Man? Was like, what? Oh, did you try to get some? No, no, but I was like, what the fuck man, like turn this off.

Speaker 2:          00:52:02       A friend of mine, his girlfriend was a misuse at one of those uh, Burke Williams places or something like that, you know, might not have been that place, but it was like a high end spa place and they had a deal that one of them dudes go because he had a, he was running a whole prostitution ring in there where guys would come in really. And it was like a, uh, like a name brand place. Yeah, like a legit place. And he just developed clientele that knew that he would suck their Dick, he'd give you a massage and suck your Dick. Like he just had the market cornered I guess. I guess it was when, when he likes sucking Dick and uh, he wanted to make some money for massages. So his books were Phil fucking are saving up for that land. That land is going to pay for itself, that, that land ain't gotta fuck itself.

Speaker 2:          00:52:52       Yeah. So if I can just plug my show. Typical Rick Season Two already canceled. I already told you that. Yeah, you told me that we were just speaking of red glowing relationship with comedy central. At least they gave it a shot. How long? How many episodes did they do before it canceled it? We did two seasons of six episodes each season. You can still watch it, but when it's not going further, what is it a surprise to you that they canceled it? No, no, no. That we had to show that we wanted to do. We wanted to bring you on to do something that was called

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       Bro Sasson and it was about a guy who's raised by an assassin and then he got the assassin. Dad feels bad that his son never had a real life. He just grew up in a sas environment, that jungle, so he sends them to college and becomes the ultimate Frat dude, but he moonlights as an assassin still, but he's still a frat guy during the day. Oh God. And that was me when I would sleep in the bed, in the or in the attic and then I would be an assassin that like on the down low at night, but I was always too high or hung over or too drunk and we wanted to you to be one of the guys that would be a recurring assassin. Dude, I'm in comedy central. Bought it in the room that I wrote the script. Everybody. It was like, this is hilarious. And they were like, no. And then just passed on it. Whoa. Yeah. I was like, alright, cool, good talk. Then I rewrote it for free and they were like, yeah, we still don't want to do it. I'm like, well why'd you buy it? They're like, I dunno. I was like, cool. See you guys later.

Speaker 3:          00:54:17       Good Talk. Hello Netflix. So our heartbeat and executive. Imagine some of the bad shows that come their way. They'd probably get so confused, you know, it's probably like bad cops, like network executives, like we get mad at them because they fuck shows up or they put in their own input. Or can you imagine how many bad shows come their way? How many just terrible ones? Think about the ones that are on the air and they're thinking about getting their job fired. The show's going to get canceled. People are gonna lose money. They're going to be out of a job. They won't be able to pay their mortgage. Like, fuck, there's all this pressure on them. Fuck. And they're like, yeah, we'll buy it. We'll buy it. Nick will have to show why I hate the show. I hated to. Sorry Dude, can I process like these people were on adderall.

Speaker 3:          00:55:02       They're all tweaking their work. They're working 10, 12 hours a day and adderall is a lot like math. If you don't know that folks. One of the, one of the key things with people they do when they do math is their shit at decision making. Their decision making turns to shit caught. Two Headline Joe Rogan says, all network executives are doing meth. That's how the. I wish that's how it works on that lane. I have a buddy of mine who's a writer and he told me everyone's on it. I said, really? He goes, yeah, he goes, I just know so many journalists are on it. So many writers are on it. They're all on adderall.

Speaker 4:          00:55:35       Well especially, I mean in Los Angeles, just like in terms of what I've seen socially out and about. I mean, Holy Shit, every chick is on adderall. It's like fucking nuts. I've never. I've done it once and I was just shitfaced somebody gay man. Of course I put in my mouth and then I just, I didn't really feel it, but you know, it kind of made me a little bit more alert, like Kinda cookie, but it wasn't anything special. But I have friends that they just, they take it constantly.

Speaker 3:          00:56:02       Yeah, it depends. I'm sure on the dosage. It depends on the person, depends on how you can handle and maybe you can maybe some people it's super beneficial and they can actually handle it. I'm not saying it's not, I'm just saying for sure there's some abuse going on. I know people that abused

Speaker 4:          00:56:16       certain things are made for a certain purpose. You know what I mean? Like when you make a pill that helps people like focus certain situation Ed folks. Yeah. That sounds like you fucking take it coachella with like a bottle of fucking fireball. That's not why anybody made it. They weren't like, yeah. This is a pill that you take at a music festival with fireball agreement along floor

Speaker 2:          00:56:44       it again, the youth gone wild skid row. Yeah. That's good road, right? Isn't it? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:56:53       I try to karaoke skid row once I was a fucking horrible mistake. I try to a karaoke. That song. I will remember you yesterday and it fucking goes on for like six minutes. And I know Larry

Speaker 2:          00:57:08       sounds like crying blog. It was horrible. I drove by the hotel the other day where Jamie Lane died. Do you know Janie Lane? The lead singer of warrant?

Speaker 4:          00:57:17       She's my

Speaker 2:          00:57:20       in the hotel right over in woodland hills. How'd he die? Um, vegetables. Eat too many vegetables. No Dude. It was all salads in his house. His place was filled to the wall with salad. Oh my God. Fucked up man. He got two healthy. So healthy drink too much water. You've heard of that? People dying from drinking too much water like Frat hazings and shit like that. One. They have water chugging contest. Super Bad folks do not do that. You can get to a state where your body literally can't process all the water inside of it and you die. You can fucking what I eat, die drinking water. How does it kill you? It ruins your Oregon's portion. I do not know. We should find that answer. You drown? That's a good question. Something happens. Some sort of toxicity, some, some effect of the water toxicity. Sound smart. When you say toxicity, it's a good word to throw in. If you're in the middle of words. We're dealing with a lot of issues and you know the random toxicity of the environment. Comedy Central.

Speaker 2:          00:58:26       Are they going to keep going with this is not happening without Ari, is that the deals are going to keep it on the Arrow season and that's it. I don't know. It was a fucking genius idea. What to take him off that show? Yeah, so fucking weird. It's genius. What? Pull them off of. I wish we could talk about why it happened. We can't, I wonder if we can know that he's got a special on Netflix. I have to ask for permission where the store is ridiculous. It's hard, man. Like I said, hard being an executive, hard being what we call a content provider. Nick, I believe you're a content provider. Got to provide with comedy central.

Speaker 4:          00:59:03       But I mean I'm just saying in general, I don't think it's that hard. If you have talent that is proven in that you trust. Like if I a network and you brought me a show that would for me, that would be a 90 percent chance that would go to pilot for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:59:17       Is nicked become executive. I'm figuring out my career was,

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       I was uh, playing the odds before they weren't 90 slash 10. It wasn't that good. Was it like 50 slash 50? So I liked the odd. So do you think you could maybe do that? My job for me?

Speaker 4:          00:59:33       Yeah, for sure. Yes. I will sign up for corporate America executive Bro. Could you imagine if decided like, I don't like to show us your pick and I'm going to be one of you. I have not thought about doing that because I hear it. I have so many friends. We all, we're all from the same talent pool of comedians and writers and suffer like everybody has stories where it's like, guy, I pitched this. I'm like, that's fucking hilarious. So like, yeah, it's fucking. They were like, no, I don't get it. Well why don't you just start doing shit on your own? Because like you did with Simon Rex in particular. I feel like you guys could easily do that on your own and put it on youtube and I bet it wouldn't be giant. We could. I mean we're going to try to shop it around to a couple of other networks and why get involved with, with other people?

Speaker 4:          01:00:12       Well, because I already have established contents. We already have two seasons and it's already there. So we just need somebody to go like, yeah, we get it. What do you own it? Like you can bring it somewhere else. Yeah, because it's just through streaming, which, you know, comedy central is obviously like cool enough that to give us that and then all the executives got fired. So. Because one well done not because they're like, what the fuck did you give him? Jesus Christ, you just going to check it away. It's going to go on vacation. Have you heard about his dreams? He's a lucky man.

Speaker 1:          01:00:46       He's kind of crazy, man. Yeah, man. You got to do it yourself. You know, it's not their fault. Even. It's like counting on them to know what the fuck they're doing. They know what the fuck they're dealing with. A really be a TV executive. Who wants to do that? How many people want to do that? They might think they want to do it, but once you realize like the stress involved, fuck all that man. It doesn't seem that complicated though, right? I don't think so. I mean if you have people that, you know, someone could bring you Seinfeld and friends and you know, the whatever name some other show brings some big ass frazier, some big ass sitcoms. Cheers. Cheers. Perfect example. And you look like a goddamn genius. He's the guy that got chairs in the air. Whoa. But you could've just got lucky.

Speaker 1:          01:01:31       They could have brought you the fucking sex in the city or the single guy or a lot of sitcoms and everybody forgot. They could have brought you a lot of bulk toilet. The musical. There was a lot of Bads, coach, you know, remember coach like coach the fuck up. Fuck is wrong with you man. My bad, bad experience. Well that's you. That's don't put that on coach. The guy who was a writer for that show on a Sitcom I did. It was like whoa. He just acted up, backed it up. Just swing. And with the old double edge, broadsword chop shop

Speaker 4:          01:02:09       I would say. But that's a different conversation. Have a network, major neck and like in one of those main, like NBC, CBS, like that's so arbitrary on what's going to be a hit. Yeah. But what they bring you like is your. I mean

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       obviously I'm come the town pool of talented people. Yeah, for sure. But even talented people occasionally create turds

Speaker 4:          01:02:27       of course. Right. So if you're a crap shoot, I'm not saying that. I'm saying there's different levels of like what could you know, what's got a better chance? Like if you bring something with a vision and it's really, you know, like you're, you're passionate about it. I would go, okay, joe is bringing me this impassioned idea that I think is funny. I'll give them a pilot. That's the thing is about

Speaker 3:          01:02:48       shows. This is a really hard part about shows you're developing, you're developing them while you're presenting them. So like the show starts out, it's a new show. You're trying to develop the characters, you develop, the way they interact each other while you're putting it on the air, like you creating any, putting on the air. Like as time goes on, things get like you saw like Seinfeld, like in the later years or friends. A perfect example. Everybody knew the characters. Everybody just flowed together. You knew even though there were a new scripts, like the thing was so established, like what was funny about it and how it worked. When you're creating a new shell, they're always like fire and peeling that Kevin James Show. Like they're, they're like, they change out the swap out the wife, like they did it on bewitched. Get her out and bring a new one in and you need a black neighbor and be like, okay, you need a gay friend. And then like, you know when, when it's not working, everybody wants to throw their fucking ges into the soup mix. Like I know the perfect thing this is missing and that's what happens with those shows. Right? They all just get looped. They just get all these different opinions until they take out like South Park, they don't listen to shit.

Speaker 4:          01:03:49       They'll listen to anything. But that's my point is that if you comment, major networks is different. Like the cable networks, they have a little bit more leeway where it's like, you know, if somebody comes in with, if, if talent comes in with a strong idea and a strong script and a strong vision and stuff like that, I think that's different with networks you're getting, you know, a bunch of major show runners with an idea and you know, they're trying to fit into a formula that's different. It's still hard. It's still hard, but it's, I'm just saying there's different percentages of it. Yeah, no, for sure. I mean, South Park came in and they were like, I mean, I remember stories where they were like, they didn't get any notes. They were like, they don't even live here. I don't think. I think they live in Colorado or something. They were just like, yeah, well we're gonna make this show and just like, stay the fuck away. That's probably a good move from evergreen. It was like one of my favorite places ever. Did you ever see the

Speaker 3:          01:04:40       original one? What would Brian Boitano do? Yeah, of course. That is, that's how they got started and that is to this day, like one of the funniest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life. When someone gave him, he was actually a girl I was dating. She was an agent's assistant and she got a vhs copy of it and she, uh, she brought it over my house and we watched together. We were fucking crying, just falling on the ground crying. He was so silly.

Speaker 4:          01:05:01       And Jesus versus Santa. Yeah. That was insane. I didn't say thing. I got the vhs tape in like 1996. I'm to say. That's exactly what it, that's the time somewhere around there. And I had that vhs and I would watch it. I was like, what? This is insane. It was amazing. So, and

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       it's kind of funny because it's much more shitty animation and drawing even in the current one, which is crazy hard to believe, you know, you watch it. It's like you're watching like ancient, like ancient cave art of Jesus or something. You know what I mean? It's like, it's weird when you're seeing this old way they used to draw everybody in comparisons to the new voices are so good. Oh, he's amazing. Yeah, they're genius. Those guys are amazing. Trey Parker did the voice in this new, um, what was the fucking animated show that I watched? He did the voice of someone then to despicable me and that's what it is. Despicable me realize. Yeah. Yeah. I saw it with my kids. It's hilarious. Those despicable me. Really good. Even if you're in a full grown adult, they are fucking fun movies. My kids love them, but I actually love them.

Speaker 2:          01:06:08       They're fun. Those movies are good, man. You saw the third one, I saw them all. I've seen the first two have kids, Bro. I seen him multiple times. Hold her kids. I saw underwear, man. Oh yeah. Captain underpants or something like that. And if they want underwear, man show called captain underpants. Yeah, as a they made a movie out of it. I'm probably not going to see that by myself. That'd be super weird because some guys just watching captain and they make good fucking kids movies today. Those despicable me movies are good movies. Yeah, they're really. Well. The third one holds up. Third One holds up. My bistronic is one. A lot of people don't like the minions. One of those little fuckers like they need. The other guy grew to balance out demands. Yeah. You can't just have the minions. Minions went rogue because it's just all these fucking assholes.

Speaker 2:          01:06:55       People didn't like it. I found it. I think it was good. I enjoyed it. I found it entertaining. Fuck them. Fuck them Indians. Well, like toy story, toy story three. It was like one of the best movies I've ever seen. I started crying. Yeah, it was good. Yeah, I wept. Yeah. There were some dark moments when the teddy bears trying to fucking throw them into the incinerator. That was intense. Intense Shit. Lots of air. Lots of. Have you ever see babe the pep talking pig moving. Did you ever see babe pig in the city? Part Two? I don't think I see that movie. They decided to take the talking pig, like broad farm movie. Throw them in the city where some of the dogs are prostitutes. It goes so fucking rogue. It's amazing. You'll love it. I'll text you and remind you. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          01:07:45       A pig in the city and there was a big outrage because it was so like aggressive and weirdly. It's super dark and trippy. Whoa. Big P there. Prostitute dogs. I swear to God. That's one of the hooker dogs and the pink. That is hilarious. Got that Harlot. That's hilarious. Yeah. Weirder dogs, man. They used to be wolves. They scare the shit out of me. I figured out a way to turn them into that and have them live with us. I think about that when I'm around my dog because my. I got a new dog recently, seven months old

Speaker 3:          01:08:15       now. I got him a few months back and he's a golden retriever. Okay. It is the least wolf like dog that has ever existed on the planet. This dog has like zero aggression in him. Like even when he play fights, like play, fight with another dog, just like zero threat of anybody getting hurt. It's like there's the, the mellowest comments and you gotta think like somehow or another people figured out how to take a wolf and slowly whittle it down until you make that. Right. Like what? What was he eating? They probably gave him some weird fucking shit and messed with his brain denial. It's just breeding. They figured out a way where, I mean, I think that life is crazy pliable and where you have the best chance of success. I mean, obviously this is not my theory, but where life has the best chance of success, it kind of molds itself to that.

Speaker 3:          01:09:08       Whether it's by putting people in colder climates, making their skin lighter so they get more vitamin D because there's no sun out. So you're saying it's atmosphere related. Could be, yeah, and the atmosphere of a dog is the only way that dog got food. It had to be super cool with people, so the dogs that were cool with people are the ones that stuck around and they kept breeding and breeding and the ones that are the coolest with the people, the ones who got fed and the other one's got shot and killed and he didn't get to breed, so it's always like the ones that are the coolest with the people that got closer and closer to the campfire and they get the scraps thrown their way. It was a sweet deal. You Bark and they. They're cool with you and they give you free food and you keep the fucking wolves and the bears from eating them and you bark, bark, bark when anything comes and they can be alert.

Speaker 3:          01:09:49       That was the whole deal with people and wolves and dogs and so they figured out a way over countless generations to turn that wolf into this fucking dog like into a poodle. Like they figured out how to do that and it's just life adapts. It. Find some weird ways through and next thing you know you're holding a French bulldog. Like what the fuck? That used to be a wolf. A wolf got whittled down to. I'm not. No disrespect to French bulldogs. They're adorable. I love those little dogs, but it's like, how the fuck did that even happen? Yeah. You never see like stone, like cave drawings. The poodles that didn't exist. It literally couldn't exist with perfect pum pum, like ankles and shit. You know what they found out about dogs, it's really fucked up, is that all of them came from wolves. They thought there was like that.

Speaker 3:          01:10:33       Like dogs came from like a bunch of different wild canids, you know, a bunch of different like African dogs and different dog. Nope. Nope. All of them came from wolves. All of them. That's super weird, dude. Well then a wolf like fucked a frog or something because there's no way a fucking bulldog just comes from a wolf. It does. Slowly but surely over thousands of years, they turn a wolf into a bulldog. Nuts. Are we going to go back to wolves? Do you think we could turn into Jello for sure. We could turn into some cube like thing that sits in a hard form that we carry around. If people found out human and you can't break your bones if you don't have any, you can move things telekinetically now and everyone's going to fit into this fucking cube and we

Speaker 2:          01:11:13       just would be this square thing with no bones. Just slops right into this just indestructable plastic barrier that you carry around in life until you wanted to fuck. And then when you wanted to fuck, you guys would get close to the bed and then you would just ooze out on top of each other. You would like open your doors together and just ooze on top of each other. That's my entire family in Arkansas that you just described to that zip pills. It's everything else. Got Them skittles. I don't try. Dogs scare me because the dog bit my balls. When I was a kid, I was playing with a ball in my front yard and I'll never forget it and I rounded third and a dog lashed out and punctured my scrotum and I ran into the house and I pulled my pants down and my mom started screaming and I just sit, so dogs have always to this day, every time I walk past the dog, I'm horrified, dude, Dude.

Speaker 2:          01:12:04       Yeah, not cool. That ain't cool. Maybe I won't be Jello Guy. Yeah, for sure. No worry about it's better path and getting bitten then nuts by a dog. Yeah. If you have no Oregon's okay. Nothing can break down. You're just a giant hive of tissue and everything now is a dream, but it's a dream that you can control. They've gotten to the point where you don't need a physical structure. You don't need skulls and Oregon's and livers, all that stuff is handled exogenously. They bring in things. They bring in like these connections, these tubes that link up to you and then slowly our bodies devolved to the point. We don't have Oregon's anymore. We rely on all our organ functions to be handled outside of the body by machines because it's way more efficient and allows you to stay in the dream state and control your life.

Speaker 2:          01:12:50       Do you have eyes? No, dude. There's no need. You see way better and the dream state, you have a mass of cells that somehow or another contains consciousness that interfaces with the dream state. Twenty four slash seven. Can I wear a hat? You can, but it doesn't matter. You don't have a head like a hat on the table. That'd be a Jello shot. You can, but you know, not a lot of juice there. You want to be a big fat tube, like a garbage dumpster filled with cells. The more cells, maybe you have the more horsepower in the dream dimension, right? That's how to make sense, right? Obviously what we're definitely devolving, right? If you go from like if you look at other primates, like primitive primates and you'll get a rang of tens and gorillas and they would fuck us up. We're so weak compared to them. Right? So if you were obviously like the weakest by far of all the primates, other than like little tiny monkeys. Yeah, for sure. So by far our bodies have gotten weaker and dozier and less capable and like our tendons are not the same. They are so much stronger than us. So there's something that's happening to our body was getting smolder and softer and weaker and they've a plant based diet, just even gorillas, chimps eat the fuck out of everything though. They eat it, they're more closer to us. They're horrifying. That story about

Speaker 1:          01:14:11       the guy who brought his chimp birthday cake and the monkey attacked him and then bit his nose off his fingers and ripped his penis off. Yeah, bite his fingers off. But it's fingers did his fingers up and his nose. You know the story? Yeah. The toward space apart. He was jealous. The chimp that attacked him was jealous because he brought a birthday cake to a chimp that used to be his. See the chimp used to be his and he would say the worst is that it? Is that the story? The chimp used to be his and he brought the chimp to a sanctuary when it got older, because as they get older, they get super sketchy. They start biting people's fingers. No, they get super aggressive and the consequences of them being aggressive or so ferocious. Don't, don't show me any pictures, please. Andi want to see it, so he had to give up the champion.

Speaker 1:          01:14:57       The chimp loved him still. So you'd go visit him on his birthday. He brought him a cake with the other chimps, saw the data and get a cake and someone fucked up and left some doors open and the chimps opened the doors and just fucked him up because he didn't give him a cake. That's all it was because he didn't give him a cake. They tore his fingers off the towards Dickoff just because they didn't give him a cake. Was that the idea? Was it because of the character? Was it the fire? No. Fairness. No, no, no. It was a fairness issue. They were jealous that he gave the cake to the one champion. They didn't get any cake and they were fucking furious. And you're also dealing with these chimps that are contained in this artificial environment that our freedom and they want to lash out anyway, and they directly associate people with being their captors.

Speaker 1:          01:15:39       You know, the people are the ones that keep them in there. The people, the ones that feed on the people, the ones that control them. And then if they can get out and fuck up, the person doesn't give him a birthday cake. Yeah. Feel like the worst aspects of people. Magnified Times. 100. Like you'd see it right in front of us. Like, yeah, this is what we used to be. This is how we got to 2017. You have to be fucking ferocious. You couldn't be like, hey man, I'm just here to be like one with the animals. Back in the days of like living with Jaguars and shit. You had to Russia, you had to, you had to literally. Yeah, it was live or die. So when we think of like what we're becoming, we're obviously becoming more passive. We're becoming more better able to deal with, uh, interacting with each other, without violence and that all that.

Speaker 1:          01:16:25       All that stuff makes us mushier all of it. Is this making more? It's not even a week. It's just like physically not, not attuned to violence. Right? So for physically not attuned to vote, why do we need all the strength? Like why do you, why do you need to be so fast? If I was trying to kill you, you don't. You sit in a cubicle all day. So everything just starts to just like a bulldog their face. Somehow they figured out to make the face. I'll flat or whole body's going to do that, man, I'm going to just flatten out. So, uh, and then our body's going to absorb the bones. Once we start like encasing ourselves and we'd go back to the Jello. Paypal. Yeah. You realize you don't even need food. You work like a, like a plant. You have this, this box that contains you and it uses photosynthesis.

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       Fuel your cells don't like water and shit. Just like soil. He needs some soil. You're going to put some soil below. You're going to be a plant. You're going to go back to plants. Fuck plants in the Matrix. Like in a week now I'll take a while. Alright, good. 100 million years or so. It will definitely be like some sort of a gigantic organism connected to some, probably some natural internet. You know what they'll do with their figure, they'll get to a point where they're like, you know what, this regular Internet is too unreliable. We're constantly relying on these cables. I have a new idea. Here's my new idea. We are going to make an internet by going into all these plants and genetically engineering them and turning them into Wifi towers. So everything is a wifi tower and this is the new Internet. They're all connected with each other and you through using a computer or a cell phone or whatever, you're interfacing with nature now.

Speaker 3:          01:18:00       You're no longer interfacing with some artificial servers and the verizon, you know, a fucking throttling your data because they don't like using Netflix. No, no, no, no, no. Now you're dealing with re-engineered plants where plants are now the distributors of information. I can't Tevye Tevye Bro, but it might be real. I mean they know that plants talk to each other. There are a hundred percent certain of the prince plants allocate resources. They have this whole, uh, underlying, like there's like a, a whole, almost like an internet of mycelium and like fungus and all this different shit. All their network of their root system and everything that they communicate with each other about what we don't know. We know that they do certain things like plants here, uh, other plants getting eaten and they changed their flavor profile and they become toxic. They have like a terrible toxic taste to them.

Speaker 3:          01:18:56       Wet. Yeah, giraffes do that. Not always. It's works or not drops of eucalyptus trees do that when drafts are eating them and uh, a bunch of different trees. They've shown that when you, not only can they, this is the craziest study they did. Not only is it not knowing for sure that these plants are being eaten, but if they hear it. So they played recordings of like crunching recordings of Caterpillar is eating leaves and they've played it next to these trees and the trees altered their profile. They started reading some sort of a chemical that makes their leaves taste terrible. So what they found is like that, like if it'll happen in Africa, we're one plant will be thanks to the Acacia tree. That's what it is. It is right. I'm pretty sure things. The occasional one that changes, it's not eucalyptus is the Acacia tree and one animal will be eating it. The other animals catch wind that something's eating it and they literally become toxic to them. They taste like shit and so they won't eat it and they'll starve to death rather than eat the plants some crazy chemical strategy and they communicate with each other. That's how they find out that this other plant is getting eaten. It goes through the ground. They have this fiber of Jesus. It goes to the ground. They have this fiber

Speaker 1:          01:20:07       of all these different organic things like like fungus and mushrooms and shit. They're communicating with the Lord. It's amazing. That is amazing to think that like they just don't even hear it. The allocate resources, they're like figure out a way to allocate resources towards plants that are connected to them that are more needy. It's a very bizarre. We totally don't know why they do it. We taught me, we don't know how they're doing, it's all some new thing over the last 20 years that people are beginning to figure out that these plants are somehow or another interacting with each other and maybe interacting with their environment a way that we just don't understand yet. It's fucking weird, man. I mean they might be conscious and just some way we just don't imagine we can't imagine it. Right. But there might be some sort of, uh, you know, we think of consciousness as like, hey man, I'm going to go to the store to do a set, you know, hey man, you know, I'm going to go take my girl to the movies.

Speaker 1:          01:21:01       That fucking planet of the apes thing looks sweet, you know, that's what we think of as consciousness. Every day I do that. But without language and whatever the fuck plants use for communicating, it might be some sort of a weird language that they have the, we don't even perceive. But we could even have classified that as language could be. We don't know. I mean, I don't know. I'm just guessing. I'm talking shit while I'm hydro right time asking questions because I just want to figure out what to have a more plant based diet, but I don't want motherfuckers whispering and shit. Yeah. Like donate careless whispers in your cauliflower.

Speaker 1:          01:21:40       Mark somebody, but maybe they like to eat them because they didn't like it. Eat them. How come when you shit out there? Seeds. That's how plants get distributed. Well, yeah. Also how do they know what tastes like shit to us? If they're altering how it tastes, they're trying to get us to eat it and it was just trying to make it better for us to eat them. Maybe they're like, oh, maybe oh he's eating mark. Maybe I'll fucking create a new spice and maybe it'll be better and he'll eat me faster. Some shit. Hence peaches. Why pizza so delicious to try and trick you into eating them. So you shit out one of those pits, right? If you get some nice nutritious shit, especially if you've been eating nothing but peaches, your shit would probably be fucking Primo for growing a peach. Just ready for an s and m dungeon.

Speaker 1:          01:22:27       You're out there in the woods, you take a massive dump with a bunch of peach pits in it and they fertilized and then a new peach tree grows and this one's even better. It talks to you in a deep, slowly, just like a wolf becoming a French bulldog. The peaches become sweeter and sweeter and sweeter, and then even we get in the mix like, you know what, this whole peach sweeten and shit just seeing happening fast enough for me like me and my boys Monsanto, we brought scalpels and laser beams and birth control pills and we're going to figure out how to get these peaches. Super Sweet. And they last for a year, right? Yeah. But what if you'd take a shit and the tree grows and it's not pages and shit. That's shit the shit. And you can't hack that square. That's what ends up happening.

Speaker 1:          01:23:10       The peaches get so sweet that they turn into shit. Yeah, right. You. That's the world I want to live in. It's like you fix it until you break it. Exactly. You fucked up. You tried to sweet. Try to get the peaches to sweet and he got to the point of grady nature rebelled. Yeah, so that's the argument for diseases, right? The reason why there's so many diseases for human beings is that there's just too many of us in nature's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You can't just do this. You can't just have 7 billion of one thing. This is fucking stupid. We've got to kill some of these things. No, we kind of figured out a way. No, we got like plague and all these different things. We're like, no, no, no. We got injections. We're gonna. Kill all that, and then we're going to keep battling it. One step ahead. Diseases and scientists are going to war everyday on the front lines.

Speaker 2:          01:23:54       I mean, that's what's going on, dude. Nature is trying to. Jack, you think they just trying to pull their. They're pulling the plug on us. What was the last time you dog

Speaker 1:          01:24:03       sick? I don't have a dog. If you have a dog, here's what you do. You give your dog a Parvo shot. They get distemper, they get rabies and they're good. They go around eating everything they find licking, licking everything, pissing on everything. What percentage of dogs get sick? Is it even one was the dogs that get cancer? Right. That can happen, but like dogs getting cold weather. When does your dog gets sick? Your dog starts sneezing. Dog. Ever get it?

Speaker 2:          01:24:32       Hold the fuck Outta here at dogs. Don't get my dogs. I don't have a dog, but if he did, I mean I've never heard of a dog getting it like a sinus infection. They happen. They happen when those bulldogs for sure they get all fucked up because their noses only like a half an inch long where they have upper respiratory like horrible problems. I have friends that are bulldogs and they said it's a fucking nightmare. One of my dogs, half bulldog. He's half bull dog and half Shiba Inu. So he's got like a little bit of a longer face. Watches that star wars character. What is the sheep dog? Okay, son of a bitch. You fucking made that up. I didn't to country. Little Furry dog.

Speaker 2:          01:25:10       That's a little on the aggressive side. You know? Get a little cunty. Senior dogs, half content, half country, half months. Naps just wants a nap, but he gets country with other dogs. He bit my puppy in the face. It's pretty cool. So your dog? No, that's not my dog, but my other dog, the biggest dog a have is the most chill. He doesn't fuck with anybody. What the fuck dog was that? Oh, I did not have eyeballs. It did have eyeballs. Do you need glasses? Let's pull that picture up. Oh, look at that little cutie. That's why I got him because he looked like that when he was a baby. That's what your dog looks like a little bit. Basically a little more bulldog to them.

Speaker 1:          01:25:51       Tell it her eyes. But the thing about dogs, man, it's just stayed very so much. Personality wise. It's a trip. You could have three dogs from the same litter and one of them's just a totally different kind of dog. And the other ones, like when they get dogs for police dog training, they never know like what dog's gonna, like how they're going to come out. Like you look for a specific type of behavior, but you don't know why he's like good blood lines and everything like that. But out of illiterate, they're not 100 percent even in a good bloodline, but they're normally what kind of

Speaker 4:          01:26:17       police dogs are never. Like, there are specific, like German shepherds are. What are they?

Speaker 1:          01:26:22       Uh, they have a bunch of different dogs. They use Belgian malinois are really good, but those are super hard to control. The golden doodle get attack dog. They're real good attack dogs like the second sick on people that like very effective because they're super hyper aggressive and they'll just go right for your throat and fuck you up. They use those a lot in military, what they would call the military theater. Oh Hm. I like that. Is that what they say? They'll say that military theater, military theater. And they said that starting closing at seven and then it's like a way to sound smarter than you really are. If you said using something in the military theater, like what kind of an asshole says that military at theater, anything you sound like you're smart with the diarrhea theater. We're going to the. Yeah. If they like had musicals and they did them in basketball courts, they'd make $2. Nobody go see a musical and a basketball court. You have to go to that. Now I have to dress up and you can see it. How it really is. Sneakers squeaking on. Aluminum steps and these people have no microphone and then below you doing their stupid play. Yeah, that'd be shit. Be like, get the fuck Outta here. Bitch theater. Who it went to the um, this new musical at the gymnasium. It was terrible. Everyone started throwing toilet paper down on them.

Speaker 1:          01:27:37       You go to the theater, you like this place is old. This must roll. I've got a new suit for the gym. Yeah. Nobody's ever said that. Going to the theater. Some of the theaters that you're performing, when you start performing in theaters across the country, you'll perform in a place. It's like star. It was founded in 19, 20 old. Weird backstages you going to walk through and everything. It's fucking pretty dope.

Speaker 4:          01:27:59       Oh, what I was going to say earlier as we were talking about Florida and I did my last tour and I did 55 cities. Everything was great and there were only the only train wreck shows where Florida and uh, I did a performance art center and it was in, I believe Orlando I'm going to say. And I showed up and they had, I went backstage and they have these huge murals for wicked and the lion king and all these huge productions. And then there was nick swardson and so I was like, all right, did this show me to stop the show? Because to chick's got into a fistfight. Oh, of course. Over what? I have no idea. It was in the balcony and I was like trying to figure out what was happening, but I couldn't because they were escorted out. And then afterwards they're like, yeah, it was a fight. And then bunch of people, there's vomit all over the bathrooms. So that I went out to the staff and was like, what happened? And all the staff were these old women that were like used to plays and musicals and weren't ready for the next sorts and fucking tornado to come in. So all

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       these, like 80 year old women were not equipped for like this, that people are sleeping in the bathroom. There's puke on the floor. Like that is hilarious. It was pretty funny. I was like, yeah, sorry about that. Next week though, we've got a next week. It's a resurgence of cats being brought back by. Popular demand. Is cats being played anywhere across the country because I know it's not on Broadway anymore. I don't know actually asked that same question. It's not on Broadway at all. That was a, the, I have a bad, bad, uh, opinion of musicals and a lot of is based on a girl that I dated when I was 18 who made me go to see cats with her and what not. And you're 18, you don't have any fucking patience for anything. Well, yeah. What the fuck? Definitely don't have any paid two years old musical people that are dressing up.

Speaker 2:          01:29:51       It is playing somewhere. Ooh. Where's it playing on Broadway apparent. Andrew Lloyd Webber's. Long running classic is back on Broadway. Exclamation point. I mean from Caroline's. Remember? Yeah. I don't mean to diss it. Last time I saw it was 30 fucking years ago, 32 years ago almost. Well, there's still cats have not evolved. I feel like I need to go now. Let's go. Go, go. Build lasted like seven stars of death deep and we should eat first like hey, take the stars of death, like full on. Take five stars of death and then have a stake. So this is my thought process. You're sitting in a restaurant like right after you order it, you go, all right, let's do this. You dumped this stars of death down your system and then the food starts coming so the food piles on your body has to struggle to digest the star and all the fat from your food like steak and mashed potatoes.

Speaker 2:          01:30:47       If you're feeling non quito and as you get it gets cooked. And like, right when these dudes like Doo Doo, Doo Doo Doo Doo dee dee dee, you, you're just in a cyclone of fear and self doubt and self criticism and introspective thinking and feeling vulnerable about everyone's watching you and you know you're going to die and everyone's going to die. And uh, and then, and then to top it off though, we bring a litter box and so we all dedicated to the litter box and then when they get mad at us for like, it's fucking were around cats too. This is perfect. I was in Pittsburgh and uh, I showed up for UFC in Pittsburgh at the same time when they had a furry convention. Oh no way. Just told you go. I would've gone into, couldn't had to work, cancel the show. I can't. I had a show and then I had to use. I like, it was there for both shows and that had the UFC way inside the way ends on Friday. And then I had the show right after. I didn't want to go anyway. I just, I just want to, like they were, you could see enough by seeing them interact in the streets, but as you're driving down the street, you would see fucking dozens and dozens of people in these furry outfits. Dozens. I mean everywhere you looked, you saw like these mascots, like

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       squirrels, fucking people that are dressed up like monkeys. Look at that. Fox is and shit. Then they fuck each other. Yeah, they do. Well, here's, so you know that anybody wearing that is fucking something. Yeah. And you know what you might like try to fuck a female Fox and you pull down the pants and it's a hairy dude, but you know, like, well God damn it, I'm already here. I'm not really ready for this. But like look how they're all walking around and they get together of um, there's photos of thousands of them together. Just thousands and people love it. It's got to be so hot. But do they physically hot? Yeah, like outfit. I mean I've worn costumes like that just said like sketches and shit. Okay. But what do you, what is going on here in this picture? This is so strange. They're courting each other.

Speaker 1:          01:32:41       They're holding hands and staring into juices, eyes like, you know what this is? It's like you saw cartoons and your little kid and they just fucked your brain and be like, well this is what I'm looking forward to when I get out of this house. Then you got out of the house, you hear car accidents, gunshots, rape, but do they fuck each other while they're both wearing a costume or do they fuck people that aren't wearing a costume? Apparently, and this is it. I'm sorry if you are a member of the furry community and I misrepresent you, but some of them have hatches were their asshole is sort of like those old school pajamas in those. A wild west cartoons. Remember the wild west pajamas where they had like a. like Popeye always had those dukie flap and you've got two buttons that cover your shit, like the shit trap and you open up the trap door and drop a bomb in there and then button that fucker back up.

Speaker 1:          01:33:27       They didn't have. They probably had draw strings. They probably didn't even have like rubber waistbands back then. Right? Like how it goes. Big Buttons on either side. How do they tighten down your underwear? Back then it was buttons that makes sense. It's probably a buttons in the front. Buttons in the Shitter who did buttons on everything back then, so these kids, they thought that was the future and then they went out there and they got punched in the face. The moment they left their house and then probably somebody did terrible things to them and they went to school and they got picked on and then he had are just wishing they were a squirrel holistically. It was horrible. Just look in the cartoon. That was my favorite thought when I was young and what's this girl cartoon and be like, Oh, you want to be a squirrel?

Speaker 1:          01:34:05       I didn't want to go to school. Didn't want to do this anymore. Just want to be a squirrel. Will the hotel where we were at, they got a request with. They're filled up with furries except me and a few of the other UFC staff. I'm not. I'm not lying. It's filled and they got a request and the request was the furies asked if they could put a litter box in the lobby. No Way. Yes. They wanted to pay for a litter box, be brought into the lobby. They liked this whole convention is all us, so can we do that? And like. I was like, what the fuck are you talking about? They took my idea for cats. They tried to get a litter box and put it in the front lobby of like the western in Pittsburgh to make smell. Ian Apparently. I mean it could have all just been just good to be like, come on man. Well they definitely were asking for food to be delivered in bowls on the ground. Whatever they ordered. They wanted to put a bowl like a dog food bowl and it on the ground. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       It was several different rooms that were requesting this that I can see though if you're going to go that distance, but if you're not taking a shit in the fucking lobby, right? August, you don't know until you ask. I think it's all us. It's all us here. It's just all us. We're amongst friends. We'll pay. We'll pay him. Let me just ask. Let's just ask like, they're so crazy. They just probably asked. Yeah, I mean I like have. They'll just have a litter box in your room. In the lobby. Yeah. Come on, man. I've been a lot of them. Had them in their room going up that fucking flight of stairs with a Duffel bag filled with litter housekeeping and a big Ole fucking plastic cement mixer for the kitty litter and one of those plastic cement mixes. You know, ever make concrete. When you were a kid.

Speaker 4:          01:35:49       Do you ever have to make concrete? No. Construction jobs. Sometimes you'd have to make concrete so you have to pour the shit and pour the water and mix it. You have to mix it. And this big old fucking plastic tub that was a lot like a big litter box and you could just do that just to get one of them. Cement mix and tubs could. Lord, I want to do that. I want to try it. If you get thousands of people, I would get into a furry outfit. I don't want to get fucked, but would you be. Who would I be? Yeah, it could be a furry. Like what creature would you? Uh, what do you feel like your spirit animal is? Nick? It's a good question.

Speaker 4:          01:36:27       I don't know. Maybe. Do you think you're a monkey or wolf? I would say a monkey over a wolf if those are the options. Okay. So we're moving more towards monkey. I'm just trying to get like a taste palate. It's a series of questions that I use to determine which one will be best for you. Oh, I would say a squirrel. Squirrel. Yeah. Like you already midwest. You are rat, but your tail is so cute. We let it slide. Plus you only eat nuts and plants. Yeah. Rats eat everything. Yeah. Sketchy. Yeah. Rats or just can't be trusted carrying diseases. Squirrels are chill. I used to hang out with girls in New York. I would go into a union square and I wouldn't get up. I saw a guy get a bag of nuts and I watched him. He would sit in the middle of the park and the squirrels would come and crawl on him and he would put the, he would put a nut in his fist and the squirrels would reach in like, like it was like a little hole and pull those out and eat it on his arm.

Speaker 4:          01:37:20       So I studied this guy for weeks and I was like, I don't want to fucking do that. So I go and I get a bag of nuts and I got the courage up and I got into the middle of the park and I sat there and the squirrels started coming on me and I started getting panicky but you can't panic. So I zoned out and then the squirrels started feeding out of my hands and I started becoming squirrel man. And then I started. I wanted to show my friends. So I bring my buddies and the like, like to the park with me and I'm like, watch this. And they'd be like, what the fuck are you doing now? And I'm like, watching this girls will be on my arms and stuff. And my friends were like, dude, I'm not on board with this. Nobody thought it was cool.

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       It just thought I was like a fucking complete lunatic. And I saw it. I was like this. I thought it was like an x men or something like that. I had gotten this like power that I dialed into like a whole. I don't know. He became like a beastmaster. Yeah, I thought it was rad. But you remember that show? Yeah, of course. The duties to be able to tell animals what to do and they all listen to him. That was the shit fucking ripped. The one thing she could remake. They fucking doubt. That'd be a sweet remake. I know 100 percent. You should be the beastmaster. You or me? We could be beastmaster. We could do it. Brothers and sisters. Beastmaster need a bunch of chicks to. We gotta you gotTa have diversity today. If you're going to pitch a show, we should have at least one black female trans beastmaster look at them.

Speaker 1:          01:38:41       That seems like the newer version of the master. Is that the original beastmaster? I didn't know. There's that guy right above that. Yeah. That was the original beastmaster dad was the dude that was in a movie called laserblast. Laserblast was a fucking favorite science fiction movie of mine when I was a kid. Man. Like during the star wars days. Yeah. And he found his gun. He found his gun on the right. Oh, so bad. You put it was this alien gun that you put in your arm, like you put your arm in it rather like you fist this gun, I guess how it works. And he found this thing like the alien that's crashed their spaceship and lost their gun and this dude picked it up and the gun slowly but surely turned him into this monster. It was awesome fucking thing. Yeah. See that guy like see the pictures?

Speaker 1:          01:39:33       Those are the actual aliens. That's what he turned into. Those. The laserblast 1978 dude. Yeah. It was 11 years old and this came out. So when you see the guy like in the upper pictures, go scroll up, scroll up a little bit, see that like the one with the teeth out and the left hand side. And the top on the left hand side. Yeah, that one. That, that is what he turned into when he kept fucking with that gun. The more it was like sort of like a take on columns ring in a way, right? Like the more he fucked with his gun, like the more he would become like one of those aliens and start shooting shit with this weird fisting gun. It was dope though, Dude. See if you can get a clip. You find a clip online. Turns into me in Vegas. Hey Dude. When you're 11, it's awesome. Cool screen. It's a special preview. Oh this is a preview. See? So dude, find system. The desert. What the fuck can the aliens like? Oh No. He's got a gun. They're pissed off. See? They're in their spaceship and he uses it right now. Somewhere on this.

Speaker 5:          01:40:35       Yeah. See the spaceship lands and visitors to the effect. Oh my God is the greatest thing of all time. Shot them. Fuck them up. And they fucked him up. Anything on this in the future? Look it up. He just looks like a Douche, right? Turned into a monster. Look. Tried to take it away, ladies.

Speaker 2:          01:41:35       We have the new studio. We should do a fight companion with this movie laser blast wound. You don't drink anymore? I do. You do? I'm just taking a break. How much of a break? I'm sorry. I started on the movie and like two weeks, so I'm taking a break until after Labor Day. After Labor Day you and I will get fucked up and we'll watch laserblast 100 percent and we will start it from play. Will Watch this fucking silly movie. Play more of it. Keep it. Just keep it running in the background the entire time. This show's on.

Speaker 4:          01:42:07       Yeah, it was like 10 seconds left of the trailer. So bad. How bad is it? That looks really bad. I'm a gun. Sounds like that. Oh, I was

Speaker 2:          01:42:18       wrong. That's not. That's not the laserblast guy. It's a different grants and different. It looks like he's from another movie though. The Guy, the laser blast guy was in or the beastmaster guy was in some other movies. He looks familiar. He looks like an old of shit. What is this a French for? Not The whole movie. They said, well wait, show beastmaster trailer, how bad it is. Look how bad. Like even though like the fucking letters or shaky like when they play the letters because when they can't even keep it, no effort into the skill back then they would like, they would do all the shit by hand like a bunch of monkeys. That's a dude. Kim Milford. Cheryl Smith was probably hot as fuck back in the day, right? She definitely did. Coke, do you think so? I mean it was 1978. I don't think they were.

Speaker 2:          01:43:05       Do. I don't think you had a choice back then? Yeah, they made you do coke. They punched in your face after you when you were born and you had to wear bell bottoms. This is the beginning of the movie. Dude's like, Hey, what's that? Like this movie? So fucking stupid. He's like, well, just walking through boiling hot shit desert. So I think this is like the alien with a gun. Well, let's save it until we wait. Okay. Yeah. That's what we watched and we'll save it. Yeah. Yeah. This is the original alien that he was a. that's what it was, that that guy dies and leaves him the gun boiler alert, so I'm wrong. I thought that that guy was the beastmaster guy, but beastmaster doesn't matter. We were still turned onto a gem with laser blast. I'm glad I remembered that. I don't how I remembered that.

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       I don't know how the fuck that's still in my brain because I haven't seen that movie and I probably haven't seen it since like a year after I watched the first sign, that singer he was in, he was in some movie, played a blind guy. That guy's been in everything. Yeah. He was a teen wolf. Kissing a dude. What's that all about? Cut that out. A beauty and the beast. He's going Lrg on that. Yeah, he's in. That guy's got a gang of movies. He did, but also peace master and the young and the restless. If you had a beastmaster, would it. Would people think it was racist? If you hired a black guy, what do you mean? If you had a guy that could talk to monkeys, because obviously he's a white guy. If it's a white guy in the white guy can walk into the forest falcons land on them and fucking drafts come up to him and he gives him an apple and shit.

Speaker 1:          01:44:45       Everybody's cool with it. But if you had a black guy like jet black, Wesley Snipes Black and he's walking through the jungle and all the animals flocked to him and he, he had the monkeys, they talk to each other. He tells the monkeys what to do. People will be like no fucking way. That is so racist. Are you saying that black people are like closer to these animals to fuck? No, no, no. That's what we're saying. No, no, no. We're saying he's really cool and the animals like, that's not what I got out of it bro. How come white people can't talk to monkeys but black people can't get the fuck out of here with your racist bullshit ass ablest movie. Right? But, but if it's a white blonde guy, you're like, yeah, as soon as I can talk to anything, it's amazing. He's like channels. The spirits with these animals.

Speaker 1:          01:45:33       They know he's pure. Isn't official here supposed to a Unicorn? People would freak out. He doesn't have any clothes on it, but it's Harris quaffed. He's like, he doesn't need clothes, bro. I just need shampoo and conditioner. He lives in the jungle, but his hair is just perfect. Fits just like styles, a little kind of frosted lightly. Somehow he is highlighted for the forest. Doesn't make any sense. He's super close with the eagles. Dude. I had a hawk issue in my backyard yesterday. Um, I tweeted. I instagram is picture that I found a hawk dead in my yard that another animal had something had bitten. It's head off. She's eaten. It's a breast tissue. Okay. So that was a while back. Well, yesterday I was out in my yard and I let the chickens out. I've chickens and the chickens are wandering around and there's three fucking hawks.

Speaker 1:          01:46:27       They're not big hawks. They're small. They're like the size of this thermos, you know, so probably like 12 inches high or something. Not a big hawk, but they're trying to jack these chickens. They're there like on the chicken coop and one of them swoops down and slams into the Mesh like bangs into the mesh of the chicken coop. Like just trying to get at them. She's a dude. So I'm like, this is crazy. So I have my kids come out and my wife come out and we're looking at these birds swooping down and one of them landing on top of the roof and the other one's in the trees. I'm like, this is so fucking strange, man. What is going on? And they're just making noise like really loud. They're juveniles and I've, I've found two of them that are dead and what I'm thinking, the two of them that I found that are dead are bigger.

Speaker 1:          01:47:13       So I did, I saw these animals, these small ones. And then the next day I found a dead one in the dead. One a also had its head missing. I think there's some sort of a, a bird war going on in my neighborhood that there's like a bird gang war going on and I think there's hawks and there's larger hawks. And um, one of my friends saw a larger hawk eating baby hawks in a tree. Good Lord. Yeah, yeah, he was, he was in the, on the way down the street and uh, apparently go into his car and he saw these hawks that are in our neighborhood killing these baby hawks and we're like, what the fuck is going on? And so I was like, well, so there were, the babies were there by themselves. They were like in the. And then the hawks killing the babies. Like he saw it happen.

Speaker 1:          01:48:02       I was like, that is insane. So this is like some sort of a gang war because they told them about the hawks being dead and he found one of them like, that shit is getting real in your neighborhood. Did it's crazy fucking hock Mageddon I wonder. I think it's just hawks killing other hawks. Like they're trying to like establish probably just like all these other animal. Apparently mountain lions do that. Two bears do that. They'll kill young ones to find other people's young and kill them because they think they're competition. There's only so many rats, you know, or a rabbit that the hawk and eat cad. Fuck Dude, that's been 10th. So we found two, two different hawks with no heads. Do you normally have a lot of hawks? Neighborhood is definitely. You see them all the time. You see him floating around. There's circling all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:48:45       See them all the time. You go all throughout the Hollywood hills. You can see him. I don't know if I've ever seen a hug. Maybe my friend Tom, Tom Sharona director, he was in his house and studio city and he watched a, a, like a dove or some small bird just get jacked by a hawk right in front of them. It was sitting on a, on a, um, a fence. Just the burbs just sitting there chilling. Oh, what a wonderful day to be a bird. And he said this Hawk just came to swap. Just grabbed them right there and fucking flew off. And they do it just for fun, right? They don't know. They eat them. They eat birds. Do they really do birds? The birds? Yeah. We played a video of owls, Jack and hawk. Oh yeah, never seen that jacking a hog. Hey. Yeah, it's crazy. I've seen owls eat rabbits and shit. Right? They put a night vision camera on this tree so they could capture these, uh, these hawks that we're in this, uh, this little nest together. It might be even a young hawk and is our will comes in from out of the sky like you don't see anything until you see his eyes. He seeds floating eyes. And then who watch this? Watch this video. It's amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       That's a hawk. Yeah. Watch this. Boom. Later. Just Jackson his buddies like more time. One more time. One more time. Yeah, let's see that again. See the little eyes in the distance. See how they're floating. Oh, Holy Shit. This bitch. Oh my gosh. Crazy. Is that so? There you go. There's your answer. Birdsy Burger. Dude. That's intense. Seat the fuck out of each. I mean if you see Ethan Hawke and your neighborhood, you get fucking lily worried. Looking very predatory lately. That would be really scary. That would be dope. I wish my last name or Hark. You can make it hawk, but he did think he does names like Ethan Wiener Schnitzel, like got to be mysterious. I've got to be Hawk eighth and Shama Llama. Dang. Dang. There's a lot of people have done that. Right? Like Jamie Foxx, he had the most brilliant idea ever. He made his name and Androgynous name so that he would get picked as people to go up in the laugh factory because it was an open mic and they would pick chicks more than they would pick dudes because there weren't very many chicks, so they're trying to get a certain amount of checks.

Speaker 2:          01:50:57       So he made his name ambiguous. He changed his name to Jamie Foxx with two x's. That's pretty cool. Smart. His old standups. Hilarious. I used to watch this little showtime. Suppose he's going to be on on Thursday. Is He really? Oh, that's amazing. Like I can do everything. Yeah. He's just bizarre. God suddenly talented. He can sing. He can act like in like little legitimate would sing and legitimately enact act and do stand up and stand up. Stand up some fucking hardest. I mean, that's to be like a monster. He was a big headliner dude. Did you remember when it was a monster? It just stopped doing it. The foxhole member, when he had that character they did on in living color. The woman with the giant crazy lips. Fucking hilarious. Who would walk on? He was the original duck face, right? Wasn't she? Was. Did she do that wasn't my imagining that she made a duck face? No, she did. Is that the original founder? Right.

Speaker 2:          01:51:53       Can I see Wanda? Do you think that ugly? Wanda is the original of the duck? Yeah. There's the duck face. Ugly wonder that character. It might be the original duck fat. That might be what? Like what? Everybody copies. That's already hilarious, right? They're hilarious dude in living color is a forgotten show as one of the funniest fucking shows. Our. Yeah. It was amazing to do. Remember Handyman. Yeah, of course. Do Remember File Marshal Bill. I remember Marshall. Bill Kinda can't stop coughing. Um, Fire Marshal Bill. I was, I was playing pool. Me and my friend John were playing pool in New York in this show was on a, you know, above the pool table and we were like, what the fuck? Like I can't even believe this is a real show. Like there would never been a show. Like when Jim Carrey played that guy who'd been burnt up in a fire, never been a fucking sketch show where they show to guy the burns all over his face.

Speaker 2:          01:52:47       Like, what the fuck? Oh yeah. And also remember that he had no lips a little bit crazy. That is insane. Clip. We'll also Venus de Milo. The person was. Did Crystal Meth, crystal Meth, trans weightlifter. Like what the, how do you even pitch that? What a crazy show people forgot. How about two snaps up? Remember that? It was amazing. People forgot. They forgot how good the show was. Yeah, they were great when we were young in the nineties. This was the show. Yeah, it was hilarious because this show is the show that launched Jennifer, Jennifer Lopez. It didn't launch her. She was a flag girl bro. Well, yeah, but I mean, but she wasn't acting on the show. Didn't matter, dude. She became a fly girl. Come on son and have some respect, right? No, I'm just saying pressed, pressed. It's. She's flagger. I just. I remember her being a flagger. I'm saying she didn't. That was her first thing. Was there a freezer? First thing, man, where she got her in the front. That's turned the bottom. Holy Fuck. I want my money back. What have you done? What do you really look like?

Speaker 2:          01:54:02       How did you do that? That is funny that they had. She was the first girl I girls. She was the first girl. Become famous for her ass. Right? Not for her. Obviously she's talented. Don't get me wrong. Now. OCI, great shape, but she also resisted the temptation to accentuate that ass and artificial manner. She's stuck with squats and dancing, respect, respect. Because she was the original big booty girl, right? I mean if you think about it and then all those other chicks. Yeah, that's the first person I remember when people are like, Oh shit, some people are taking it too far. I saw a young lady this weekend that was just taking it way too far. Well, I mean why it's a implants to me are so bizarre. I don't know why the fuck. I don't know what that does. That's a real. But that Jennifer Lopez, but that is a bottom. That's, that's legit. That is Latina DNA. That's exercise, squats, dancing, and just the sheer love of Dick that just just comes out in everything. She does like, look at that. God Damn that woman's hot. She's 48. She can be 100 watts. She's creative. She's 100 and looks just like that. People will line up to fuck her. Look at her skin. She's an insane, insanely hot. Some westworld shit while she's got like super power DNA, like there's no way you just get that with a regular person. That's like super power DNA. Yeah. No, that's amazing. Um, what was the point? It's like my skin. Oh, see she, she stayed natural man. That's the crazy thing. Like there's so many women like and obviously not her stature where they're like

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       legit movie stars and stuff like that. But like some of these pop gals or stuff in so much fucking stuff into their ass that it wiggles a waterbed themselves. There was some. What is the girl's name at Iggy Azalea. Is that her name? There's a video that she's doing what? She's shaking her ass and it's literally like trying to fuck in a waterbed. It's like whoosh. Sound effects. It's like stop slow down. Unless that's your real ass. In which case multiple policies. Multiple. Realize your big ass shaming, your body shaming and body shaming. But if you have a crazy body, we're going to talk about it. And if you're asked that giant people gonna talk about it. I guess it's body shaming to be. No, it's. It's a surgery shaming. That's what it is.

Speaker 4:          01:56:41       I think that's legitimate to surgery. Shame.

Speaker 3:          01:56:43       Sure. Right. If you call it like if it's like if we had done that earlier, would we have lost Michael Jackson? Like if so many surgery shamed in like soup a dude, hey, hey, hey, stop. Yeah. What do you. What are you doing? What's going on? Why does your nose doing this? Once you go into why is he getting so small? He doesn't know. Started caving in. Met Everyone. Was Katie

Speaker 4:          01:57:04       aware? Good Lord. Good Lord. I mean I have a friend so I went to dinner with a friend of mine. She's awesome and I hadn't seen her for awhile and she got plastic surgery, plastic surgery and I didn't, she didn't bring it up. I hadn't seen her for like five years and I was, it, it was noticeable. Not Big Time but enough and I didn't know how to handle it. I didn't know what to do so I just didn't say anything but I wanted to be like, why? But, you know, once somebody already does it, it's kind of a moot point to be like, Hey, what you do, go back. So I just let it go. But it was really awkward because it was, she was already fucking gorgeous and then I was, I don't know why she did that to herself. So it was really, it was really bizarre. It's very bizarre feeling you. Have you experienced that? Have you had seen? I mean, you must've.

Speaker 3:          01:57:55       I have, but my friend, um, even weirder was dating a girl in the Asian girl who got that eye surgery when. Yeah. Yeah. And he hadn't seen her in a long time. And then he actually told me about this. Excuse me, after we did the podcast, we were talking about that eye surgery. Remember when we showed it, like how many Korean women in particular are getting this crazy surgery where it changes your face. It makes your eyes way bigger. They cut your lids. Oh, give you like this anime, weird look. And it's apparently super, super popular. He hadn't seen her in awhile and then he saw her and she had the thing done and he didn't recognize her. He was like, what? Right. It was like, it was off. It was like if I saw you and all of a sudden your eyes were giant and had to go, hey, what's up nick? I could look at that.

Speaker 2:          01:58:43       Wow. You that. In that case it looks really good, but I was going to say Bravo, but it's a, it's a weird thing that is like super, super common to get that look. Right. So they go from having. Is that a bunch of different girls who that scares the shit out of it. We have a friend. I just realized who got it done. If that's a bunch of different girls. That freaked me the fuck out. Have you seen him? No, he got it done. You know what that is? Of course he did the same thing with the eyes. Let's keep it on the DL. Yeah, that's why I wrote it down and show you. But that's like your. She's becoming westernized to see this is what they do. It's so crazy, dude. They slice your lid and then they take like a chunk out of it.

Speaker 2:          01:59:24       Like say if you were cutting up a mango in a slices, they take a nice little mango slice and then stitch that bad boy up and then your lids are just way smaller. Says nations have different need for beauty choice. As in Korea, the land is small and crowded that everyone can see can look at each other in the face. What the fuck he talking about? No, you don't like having slanty eyes. That's all it is. You don't like the way your eyes look. I get it. Don't say crazy shit unless that's a translation problem. Nations have different need for beauty. Listen to this explanation. Hey, why do you guys have so many eye surgeries? Well, in Korea the land is small and crowded and that everybody can see can look each other. In that case, the fuck. Did you say you're. You're on pills?

Speaker 2:          02:00:15       Yeah, they got faced. Well, it must be some sort of a translation issue. I think so, yeah. Because like if you said that to me, I'm like, nick is. I think he's gone crazy duties. He doesn't. The sentences don't make sense. No, Joe didn't do many sense. I drunk my eyes. Couldn't see about your face. Hi, what's wrong? What was that weird? Yeah. No, my friend that I hadn't seen for awhile. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what to say, so I just started screaming and threw hot water on her face. Oh my God. As Taos that lives. I could. I started screaming. We've got a boiling pot of water and started yelling at the restaurant and everybody stopped and I just ran out, jumped into cow. Do you remember the night of the living dead or not? Dead invasion of the body snatchers when someone would turn into one of those things and they would just be like, just something wrong. Yeah. Like, I don't know, something's wrong with nick. He just doesn't seem like nick anymore. There was a slight wrong. Nothing you wouldn't wander off and really be an alien would find the pod, but go find the pot under your bed, like cobwebs and shit. Like oh ill will. It's like the thing. I remember the thing I do. That was the fucking. It's the best movie. One of my favorite movies of all time. The original John Carpenter is. Fuck

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       yeah. Well that was so trippy. That was a no. Yeah, that was a remake, but it was good. Awesome. Phenomenal remake. But that was so trippy because you didn't know until they burn their blood. Who is an alien. So you, you're just walk around like, Yo, what happened to Gary? I don't know. You all right, mark? Yeah. Yeah. Just tired. Didn't he get the dog to it became part of the day. Remember that when they burned it, they got the dog to technicals and shit. Remember when they're doing an operations guy, God remember when they're doing an operation on the guy in the chest, opens up and becomes jaws and bites his arms on the. What's it called? The Fridge? A little simulator. Fibulator, defibrillators. And it's fucking this. Go through it. Turned into jaws and open up and bit his arms off. Yeah. That be ruled that movies.

Speaker 4:          02:02:37       And it holds up even though the effects are bizarre. It holds up. It's still gives you like wicked anxiety dude. Kurt Russell. And this movie is like one of my all time favorite. Yeah, look at that. That's crazy. It opens up and bites on guys. Cheers. Cheers. He could be. He's not, he shouldn't be. Just say was, is this a scene from cheers. That's one of the last episodes. So they cut them off. Yeah. They like, these guys are going crazy. Like Steve Your cutoff. Remember it turned into a big spider thing. Yeah. That was Kinda the head popped up legs and started running around like a spider. That movie was scary as fuck, man. How about the end and is the best? Don't spoiler alert. Spoiler. I didn't. I didn't that Rick Baker. Yeah, for sure. That's Rick Baker. He's the special effects guy that did American Werewolf in London is fucking ledge.

Speaker 4:          02:03:26       He passed away, right? I do not think he did. I think he's still alive. Oh, sorry. Right. I believe Rick Baker still alive. I think he was just working on something. Something that's going on right now. I forget what it was, but I feel like, uh, there's some new project that I just read something about. I forget what the. Goddamn it. Did you see the new version of the thing? They did a third version. I saw it. I thought it was good. I did not like it. Oh dear. You know, I just thought it was. I wanted to like it, but I just thought it. I thought it was bad. Okay. Bro. People get mad if you don't like things they like, yeah bro. You know, maybe you suck. You saw they turn it on, you get mad at you, but also I'm somebody who were like, I wanna like shit.

Speaker 4:          02:04:09       So like when people are like, oh, you're just a hater, it's like, no, I fucking go to a movie because I want to like it. If I watch something like I don't want to hate something, why would I go? Why would I make an effort to go to a movie to hate it? That's fucking retarded. I agreed to go and then I'm like, oh, this is, I don't like this. And then people go, no you don't. And I'm like, no, I don't. I just, I didn't like it. It wasn't, you know. And I'm on your side Bro. Thank you Jesus. Everyone so touchy. Yeah, that's ridiculous. Did you see life

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       with Ryan Reynolds? I did see life. Did you like it? I liked it. Did you like it Jamie? I liked it. I put it on twitter and I got attacked. People like your flow Canadian chose sucked. That movie. Blue was stupid, was cliche. Same Old Shit was a rebuff of aliens. There's a lot of people that liked it, but it was like, it seemed like there was a good percentage of them that hated it. Well, here's the thing, it's like that critique where people go, it's, you know, they took this, this and it's like, yeah, movies do borrow a certain elements and especially like life had certain stuff that, yeah, devices that they used, but it's also, it's still, you just have to go. Okay. And then like sit back and just enjoy performances and enjoy what they made. It's a fucking really well shot movie.

Speaker 2:          02:05:18       You know what it really highlighted to me that television shows like contagious bro. Now you're doing it. Yeah. Thanks. Television shows like house of cards in game of thrones, these serial shows, they've ruined movies. This is why, because like to tell a story in 90 minutes or so limited, you can only get so invested in the character. There's only so many different plot twists you can have. Like especially like this sort of a genre, right? Like you take an alien life form, it gets onboard board that people and tries to kill him. Okay. How many, how many times have we seen that? We've seen that a thousand times in movies, right? Right. So you're gonna run into a bunch of pr and you've got to jam it all into 90 minutes. Like there's certain things that have to be like plot mechanisms. They have to take place.

Speaker 2:          02:05:59       Like the alien has to attack the first person. You're going to see it coming. There's going to be like a bunch of shit going on. You have to adhere to certain cliches. Got Devices. That's that. People that the Jew like prometheus's I did like I didn't like is I didn't love it and I liked the new alien. I didn't see the new alien, but I heard it's awesome. It's great. I mean I liked both of them. I got a lot of shit for that. People are like, you're a fucking idiot. And I was like, easy grandma. Be hanging around with me. And what is that? No, it wasn't my ground. Nobody know, but people I do hang out with people that are critical like director friends and shit, but oh, directors of the worst to watch a movie with. Yeah, they're pretty bad director people because they're, they're so beyond critical, but like I'm critical of comedy.

Speaker 2:          02:06:41       It's like when I go to comedies, I walk out of a lot of them because I just. I'm like, you know what the worst is if you. You're around actors that haven't made it. Actors that like barely work negative. I don't even understand that choice. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. That's really bad. Whatever happened to his career, you're like, that's Daniel Day Lewis. What's his middle of the day? And his crew are really fell off after that movie. Somebody said that about the dude and Jurassic Park. My keys in fucking Jurassic Park. It's one of the biggest movies of all time. Everyone's career falls off after Jurassic Park. Okay. It's no way to get bigger. You stupid. Fuck. Like I'm sure the guy probably did a lot of movies after Jurassic fucking park also. Maybe he made enough money that he doesn't have to do movies anymore. You twat right? Yeah. He's his fucking Jurassic dollars

Speaker 4:          02:07:37       and can I have my latte? I'm tired of this. Who's his choice? His career. His career totally dropped off. Did you say nonfat nonfat soy, nonfat soy sugar free please? Yeah, it is funny. Like, I'll uh, I'll do interviews for stuff and they'll be like, yeah man, I'm just looking over your stuff. Why did you do that movie? And I'm like, because my friend was in it and he asked me to do it because I suck. Like I fucking. Yeah. I'm friends with people and they were doing a project and they're like, hey, you want to do this? I'm like, all right, I'm not going to go. No, fuck you man. My friend. Like, yeah, there's other variables besides, you know. Yeah man. I was willing to do your assassin show. Exactly there. It says right there. You would do that. Trust me. Exactly. I didn't even look into it.

Speaker 4:          02:08:29       Yeah. That could find out like halfway into the filming, Nick eats a pound of adderall a day, a full pound of adderall. They, they, they deliver it in pounds. He just on adderall. He doesn't even know he's making a movie. He just found out it's a movie. I thought he was in a dream about making a movie. You just found out he's actually making a movie. He has no, he thought it was at the fit, so he hasn't slept in a year. Just one year, no sleep. This guy puts adderall on his foot and then kicks it in the next mouth thing. If you didn't sleep for a long time but you were still up moving, you would probably just start. Just start hallucinating, right? Isn't that what people did right? Was the story. I did a show in Tahoe riders on the storm riders. I did a show in Tahoe and I forgot to be hydrated so I didn't get hydrated at all.

Speaker 4:          02:09:17       And so I didn't drink any water and I was drinking on the plane that me and my buddy got an arena and he drove a Tahoe. We were drinking in Tahoe and I did my show. We just kept drinking. I didn't drink any water. And then I got back. I was up like, I dunno, maybe like 15 hours. And then, uh, I kept drinking and like didn't really think about it. And I'm at the Casino, I'm having fun. And then I started feeling sick and then um, I tried to go to bed and I can't. And then, so I'm awake throughout the night and then the next day I'm like still awake and I'm like kind of panicking now because I haven't slept for like over 24 hours. And now I have, like, I've realized that I have altitude sickness because I had my puking and then I haven't, so I'm starting to drink water.

Speaker 4:          02:09:58       So I got, I drank and I had alcohol poisoning and altitude sickness and sleep deprivation. So I flew home to La and I had slept for like 30 fucking six hours and I'm in my bed. I'm like, I got to go to sleep so I get in my bed and then, uh, I just start hearing like music and like all this stuff and like people, like there was a party next door but there was no party. And then so I was like, what the fuck? And then I'm lying in my bed and I just hear pounding on my floor. And I was like, what the fuck? And I heard like legitimate, like pounding. And I was like totally awake and I realized I hadn't slept and then I like took like a sunlight, some sleeping, like at some Nyquil or something. And then I finally got to bed cheese. But it was super weird, man.

Speaker 1:          02:10:41       Yeah. I've heard people that do those races, those ultra marathon races, they start seeing shit that's not their cam. Didn't have that happen to him. But I've heard other people, they see people on the side of the road waving at them that aren't even there. Really did altitude we ever got out suit fucks with me real bad. My friend Ben, Ben, Brian who was on the show last week, the week before last, he was talking about how he was in Nepal and he was getting out to sickness while he's in Nepal and he saw a baby on the side of the road and there was no baby. And he saw a wolf saw wolves. Like two guys. There's a wolf is a wolf. And they're like, oh my God, how many know what he's way the fuck up there. Yeah, bugs are bad. You know, he's above 13,000 feet. And uh, and he was sick too. He was. Everybody got food poisoning. So he calls food poisoning and altitude sickness. Oh. And it was just seeing things. It's not a baby. He's like, you guys don't see that baby.

Speaker 4:          02:11:34       Nobody was like, oh my God, you see a baby, you see a baby, it's a baby. Just chill on the side of the road. It'd be like, look, look closer at the baby. And then I just pushed him off. Deuces you, that Guy Deuces dot. You're the one who cuts his losses. Like this guy is not going to make it. Bang. I've got to think about survival. The group, man, your buddy would not survive around me. Do last. And think how you would've handled things differently. I never saw last summer. So I went up to sewed,

Speaker 1:          02:12:03       never saw one episode. I've heard that. I watch it. Yes, up until like the last season and then quit. I heard it. I heard it kind of jumped ship last season. It was like they're all standing around while there's a pool that brings you back to life. And no one's freaking out. Like, what is wrong? What the fuck? Kind of show my watching. Did you guys forget? The people have to believe this shit. Okay. What do you do? They're just standing around there and like that perfect order that you do on sitcoms was the person talking here and there's another person talking about with that never happens in real life. The perfect blocking. Yeah. Perfect. Blocking and we let people look at each other. You fucking asshole. You all standing around. No one's freaking out. There's a pond that brings people back to life and you guys are just phoning it in.

Speaker 4:          02:12:47       I think that's why I jumped ship and excited to see derailed. Super Bad. And then I heard the. The writers didn't think it was going to go that long and so they ran out of shit that. So that somebody told me that they were like, yeah, we didn't think it was. We weren't really ready

Speaker 1:          02:13:00       in the beginning though. The beginning. It's so good. It's such a good show for the first, like she knows how many seasons I binge watched was like five or six, right? Yeah. Up until the last season it started to fall apart. He died, I fell apart, spoiler alert. It's that many people on the show. And our boy dominic who was on the show has been on this podcast. My funny, my buddy, uh, Jorge Garcia. And then what happened to kind of overweight, uh, won the lottery and there's the girl, that girl from last. She did it. Oh, she was one of the girls

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       in the hobbit movie. Yeah. Yeah. She was like an Elf elf chick hot as fuck. She the elephants. And then. So as Dominic Monaghan. Yeah. He was enough to. She was hot. No, no. Dominic was something else. Wasn't the hobbit. He was a hobbit. Yeah. One of my favorite moments. I was in an additional one time years ago, and the Lord of the rings, you just come out and I had seen it and we were auditioning for some shitty movie and he was in the waiting room and they came out and they're like, we're running about 40 minutes behind. I was like, are you fucking kidding me? He was like, Jesus, man, what the hell? And I go, why? What are you doing here? And he goes, what do you mean? I go, you were just in Lord of the rings. And he goes, yeah. And he goes, and I go there, they shouldn't make you wait 40 minutes, dude.

Speaker 2:          02:14:13       That would be fucking mad. And he was like, you're right. I go, yeah, no shit. I go fucking call your agent, man. You're a fucking in the rear. One of the rings of the Lord. Will you do doing that? Just to kick him out of there so that you can get the. No, I would have let him go in front of me. I'm the good guy. Wow. I was like, I would have been failed. I was like, dude, you're in the biggest movie of the world. Put that picture back up once. See something here. I forgot all these characters. Now remembering them when I'm seeing this again. Remember the Middle Eastern guy was named his name. He's a bad motherfucker. He was a first Middle Eastern do to get the fuck white chicks in a big time show, right? He had a hot white girlfriend did there. Keith urban is on it.

Speaker 2:          02:14:53       No, that's not keith. Urban pro. Dare you and then there's the Korean guy who was in Hawaii five o and he just, they want to believe in Hawaii. They're pissed off. They were saying that they don't get enough respect like the Asian actors weren't getting paid as much as the white actors and Hawaii. Five o. That was the complaint. I don't know if it's true. I don't know if I would complainant. If I was on a show in Hawaii, I'd be like, yeah, just pay me and fucking Doritos. I don't give a shit dude. I think after awhile you just get tired of everything you're doing. If you're doing somebody show and in paradise you tired of being impaired. I said, bet right. Don't they say people get island fever. They moved to like a Wahoo and then after awhile I'm like, I gotta get Outta here.

Speaker 2:          02:15:34       I can't do that as well. Right. I guess I don't know if I could. I would love to do that. That's a fever I would not mind getting. Do you see yourself living in Maui in the future? Yeah, my buddy. We'll put a bar there. You buddy opened a bar in Maui? Yeah. And he said, um, I opened a bar, it's a true story, and I go, can I get a job? And he goes, what do you mean? I go, I don't know, can I? What can I bartend? What if you was like, yeah, the House Mc. I don't want to fucking be the house. I'm seeing them just have a microphone and start talking to people away from Bob. That sounds horrible. That went from really per Paris paradise sick. Is that a word? Yeah. To know? Yeah. I don't want to be a fucking. I don't know. I don't want a microphone. It would be nice to like, bartend and be like, yeah, Robin Cook a couple of my tabs over here. Just be like cocktail. You know what I mean? They can give you a sweet apartment above the bar and you wake up with a pounding headache every day because you're just drinking yourself to death. Yeah. Fuck yeah. Sign

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       me up.

Speaker 1:          02:16:31       Sound of the water crashing into the bottom of the building. Hit some way is like stone pylons and hold this bar up and it's elevated over, partially elevated over the water. Eat some leeching off the tree. Fresh leg. It's really a contradiction. It's a conundrum because you're in paradise. It's the most beautiful place on earth. It's peaceful. You're relaxed, you've given away all your personal belongings. You're a pure minimalist. Now what do you have? You have a few pairs of shorts, some flip flops, and a microphone. Case. The microphone downstairs breaks because that's what you do. Now you go down and talk to people. Go down tonight, Nick d do standup anymore. Well, can I do stand up? I don't have a mic, but you know, they never know when I'm coming.

Speaker 4:          02:17:12       I have a mic. So yeah, it's kind of whenever I want to do it. Immediately you telling me you wouldn't go to a bar if you knew that every night Joey Diaz was going to take a microphone and just start walking through the crowd and talking shit. A hundred percent. I would do that 100 percent. Yeah. But that's Joey Diaz. Like, um, I wouldn't be good at that. It wouldn't be now, but you got to get better. Okay. Can you get better at being a bar guy? Bar EMC? EMC. It's a skill man. Like anything else, like playing golf, like jerking off, you get better at it. Right? It doesn't make sense. It doesn't, but I think it does. No. Maybe you could just be like, you turn to a singer. Everybody's like Nikki. She really tell jokes again. No Man. I'm Jimmy Buffett songs. What? I make my voice though.

Speaker 4:          02:17:59       So I'm like diarrhea and have everybody clap. Yeah, he could have like funny songs. Yeah. That's the move, right? I'm on board. Right? I hope I get to go to dinner. Joe, where you going? I'm going to leave right now. You can play. It's pretty soon. You're going to a vegan place. Dude. You're healthy and up. What are you doing? I know, I'm trying to, uh, just, just kind of get back into shape. Yeah. So getting back into the gym and uh, I'm in. I've been pretty good with my diet. I'm getting kind of fascinated by diet. So I've been off dairy for eight years. Whoa. And then, uh, I've been pretty much cut out sugar. I have like dark chocolate if I really like start craving shit, but I'm trying to like really get my body. I'm like really fascinated by diets by new fascination.

Speaker 4:          02:18:43       Well, you find the difference, right? You eat healthy. The difference. When I quit eating dairy and it was some random dude at a juice bar who worked there and I was always sick and he was like, hey man, you're always six words in. And I go, yeah. And he was like, do you eat a lot of dairy? And I go, yeah, he goes, do this. He goes, quit eating dairy for two weeks. See how you feel. He's like cold Turkey. And I go, okay, fuck it. So I did. And I haven't been back in eight years. My sleep, everything. My stomach never got sick, never got migraines. It changed everything. And then I got super fascinated by that. I still drank by tits off, you know what I mean? Have you tried raw milk? No. Apparently some people have an issue with homogenized and pasteurized milk and they don't have it with raw milk or they don't have it with goats

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       milk too. Especially raw goat's milk. I've heard about goats milk. I just want to just bypass all of it. I do like almond milk and rice milk. Yeah, well it's, it's a, it's an ethical thing to bypass to if you really stop and think about it because there's something fucking creepy about mass produced like handles yanking on titties and these cows that are like kind of perpetually pregnant. Like isn't that what they are? They're the cows. Like they're constantly nursing. Right. So they're, they're, they make them get knocked up nor to have the milk come out. Right. The milk doesn't just come, it's out in there. Their nursing. It's a little weird. I don't know. It's weird. It's fucking weird. But I want to try to fuck with going Vegan for a little bit and just see how it is. So you know, so far how long you been doing it?

Speaker 3:          02:20:11       Two days. But I mean, for the most part, I don't really eat a lot of red meat and uh, I mean I eat like chicken and fish, but I'm going to try to go vegan. I'm going to try to do it for like two weeks, you know, one way that you can get protein that's very ethical and um, you don't even have to think about it too much is scallops and muscles and things along those lines when you eat, I'm the fuck. Are they called mollusks? Is that the word? Shellfish. Shellfish is what I'm looking for. Shellfish in particular, like especially like clams and oysters, oysters and things along those lines. They're so primitive. They don't even have nervous systems. We just think of them as like an animal, like a living creature because they can move and close this. But a venus fly trap is probably way more sophisticated and it's a plant way more sophisticated in organism than that.

Speaker 3:          02:21:06       And then, especially if you're talking about those acacia trees, they'll have this communications that there's nothing going on like that with mollusks. They're like really stupid. There was super ancient life forms that are kind of meat, but they're almost like what we're talking about, like that fucking gelatinous thing inside of the box. That's what they're like. You could eat it. Yeah. Scallops are amazing. I mean, I've had scallops. They're amazing because they will. Yes. Oh, scalp is a mosque like clams and mussels and mosque. Oh, that's a genre expert. Five minutes ago. Can you remember the name of it? I just forgot, but scallops are amazing, but those things are like a good way. Oysters, they're a good way to get protein. A lot of them is sustainable. A lot of those things are sustainable because they actually make like farms have them. They grow them on the ground the same way you would grow fruit.

Speaker 3:          02:21:53       They grow them on the ground of an ocean obviously, but the same way you would grow fruit or grow vegetables, like you can grow these things and they're a good source of quote unquote animal protein in an ethical way. Like these things are so primitive. They have like they're, they're, they're not feeling shit. Like they're not getting bummed out that you're eating right. They just clamped down and closed. They were like super duper high in protein. Yeah, very high in protein. Really good for you. I'm oysters are a good way to, especially oysters in olive oil. It's a good way to stay in a fat based diet like Ketogenic Diet because there's so much fat

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       in them for the olive oil and then the oysters themselves. Very, very healthy for you. Yeah. Really good for your body. I got sick from noise because I had too many at one time, but there's a different, different story. You know, raw oysters. You really got to get fresh. What are you talking about? Talking about cooked, smoked oysters. You getting like cans? Like I take them with me on the road. I'll tell you a buy them in bulk and I'll take them with me on the road. So I have healthy snacks like in my hotel rooms. And Oysters isn't bad for you? No, no. I'm sure like there's some leaching of all sorts of different things. When you put something into a container. I wouldn't. I wouldn't say she eat it every day because I used to eat sardines every day, but I turned positive for arsenic.

Speaker 1:          02:23:10       They found traces of arsenic in my system and they were like deadly. It is, but apparently it's just one of the heavy metals that is a at the bottom of the ocean that's affected by pollution. The levels of it are affected by pollution and so these sardines are particularly the kind of bottom feeders and if you're in a polluted area and you get sardines from polluted area, they'll have heavy metals in them, you know like mercury, Mercury here that. So I got off the sardines for awhile and went back and got tested. It was a hundred percent clean. They were like, it's gotTa, be the sardines. I said, totally makes sense. Can't eat them every day, bro. I was eating like three or four cans a day, like three or four kids. Anything is high in sodium. Two sodiums. Okay. Just drink as long as you drink water.

Speaker 1:          02:23:57       Sodium was fine. Like the idea that there's a, a total misconception about sodium causing high blood pressure and heart attacks. That was all based on a bullshit study at. Somebody pushed through what? What was that study like? Sodium does not cause high blood pressure. Go Google that because there was this whole bogus study that people keep repeating over and over again about salt. Obviously you have too much of anything to kill you, right? Like we talked about, water. Water will fuck you up too much. Salt will definitely kill you. Too many star trek a pound of salt. You're fucking dead, man. You're a dead man. You can eat a pound of meat. It's time to end the war on salt. Zealous drive by politicians to limit our salt intake has little basis in science. Yeah, it's bullshit. Not only that, it's an essential mineral like you need salt, salt.

Speaker 1:          02:24:43       Is it really important that you don't want to have too much of it? Absolutely. That meaning like you don't want to cover everything in Salt. Just like you don't want to drink too much water, just like you don't want to eat too much fruit. Like if you eat too many oranges, it's not good. You get 100 oranges is not good for you. It's horrible. So much sugar. So much sugar. Yeah. But to have a good healthy amount of salt in your diet, especially like Himalayan salts, really good minerals that shit's ancient. These things are like Himalayan salt. That's salt crystal thing. That lamp, that salt water. If you ate that, see that one over there and it's lit. What if you ate that? Probably super good. Make Your Dick hard as a rock that um, that thing's supposed to like emit energy man.

Speaker 2:          02:25:25       Feels like it wasn't at. It's over there. We, you, Jamie. Remind me to replace the battery in that one or whatever the fuck it needs. It doesn't need a new bowl. Just duck. Duck like Oh fuck. We're at burn me. Yeah. Don't fuck with it. Did it shouldn't? No. Dude. Is it plugged in? Plugged in anymore? I think I unplugged it. I hope you wrote off. It doesn't work and just keep it plugged in while it's just in there cooking. I cut back on smoking. Yeah, I've been good with my diet. I'm like really fascinated by it. So you got somebody doing this for you. You talking to a nutritionist? Eating Shit and just going by he makes sure that you you get what you really should do really should do and I can send you to a guy is go to a real good doctor that specializes in nutritional profiles and get your blood work done and let them find out like, do you need maybe you need nice and you need vitamin D, need vitamin B like here you are low in this or you're low in that. There's a lot of stuff that people neglect in there and didn't even know. You know, you don't know until you actually get your blood work done. You don't know what's low. What's.

Speaker 4:          02:26:29       I do want to do that. I mean I'd take a lot of vitamins and stuff and I asked her. I think I, I kind of like, I'm doing a decent job just going rogue. That was my last tattoo by the way. How drunk were you when you. I was actually pretty deezer. I got him. I got to Vegas. Why did you decide to write rogue and your arm and was me and my buddies and we'd go like one more like partying and like my buddy will text me like, hey, you want to go to the gym? And I'm like, I'm going fucking rogue. Then that just means that it's gonna I'm signing up for your vendor.

Speaker 2:          02:27:02       Good partier though, Dude. Oh, tell you I've run into you going rogue many times and it's never been anything but hugs and laughs.

Speaker 4:          02:27:09       Oh yeah. No, I'm like a really good drunk, like I know how to do it and I know I'm not like people like see me. Like I post photos and shit. I'm always, you know, out like raging and I'm not always raging but when I do it's really controlled. It's not like you're good at it. I've, I've built up a tolerance of an I know what I'm doing. Like I don't just do any shot that's handed to me and just like I, I dunno, I, I keep it very simple. But yeah, I get really fired up. I just, I love drinking and going out. Yeah. I've never like fighter guy or I'm never like Moody Dark Guy. That's the worst. The depressed cry guy. So Jesus, will you stop. Why are you crying all over? He broke up. It happens. Yeah. So for you. Yeah. I'll never quit drinking drinking's to fun though. Thank you. Know it said that I. Yeah, I don't. I mean I'll take break.

Speaker 2:          02:28:08       I liked drinking. It's fun. I don't like the effects of it on the body, but it's, that's the, that's the fucking tradeoff. The tradeoff is it's fun for a little while and then you're like, oh, was in Italy? I drink wine every night. I was in Italy. I just got back. I drank wine seven nights in a row. Uh, drank many glasses of wine. I passed a seven nights in a row. I totally went off the rails with my diet. I gained five pounds of to. It's Italy. That's what I'm saying, Dawg. Shit, yeah. You got to go off the rails and enjoy yourself. But it's fun to go off the rails and get back on the rails and you appreciate being on the rails unlike the way you think. Yeah. But you're like, you're not a drunk that I'd ever avoid. If I see this.

Speaker 2:          02:28:53       Certain people, we all know them. You see them drunk and you're like, oh no, I can't be responsible for this. I gotta get Outta here. Yeah. No, it's scary. There's some comics where I'm like, Ooh, I gotTa Babysit, Babysit this person. There's some dark motherfuckers completion. So that to me, broom, like, oh my God, I can't do this. Can't do this. I can't read your texts. I can't help you with this. This is yours. Yeah. People go bad. Rogue Scott. My kids, Bro. Okay. Okay. I got it. Hey, look at the time. You're not thinking rational. You're drunk. Party didn't do a family. Meanwhile in the middle of it, like he's gone through tinder, swiping the fucking worst. I lost one of my best friends who is like one of my road fucking buddies. And He, uh, my roommate was friends with his ex girlfriend and they were watching a movie and I came home and I went to bed and said hi to him.

Speaker 2:          02:29:55       And then the next day he like flipped out on me and I texted him. I go, what's up man? He's like, my ex girlfriend was at air, fucking house. I go, yeah, it was watch a movie with my buddy. And he's like, what the fuck man? It's like he didn't tell me fuck you. And then I never talked to me again. So you were supposed to tell him that his ex girlfriend is dating your buddy? Yeah. It's like, well it was so bizarre and he's one of my best friends and he won't talk to me. That you wouldn't, didn't tell him about it. Yeah. And it's been a year and he won't talk to me anymore. Whoa. Now does he, did he want you to stop it in some way? I don't know. I never found out. That doesn't make any sense. So I could understand like if you want, if you told him he would just get bummed out.

Speaker 2:          02:30:38       Right. Well that's the thing. They were just watching a movie. It wasn't like a, but they weren't dating. It was just really weird. Anyway, my point being is that while you around soon as you got out of the room, it was a love song, but it's like it's like bad road friend that just gets fucking needs this, you know, I, I just can't deal with drama. Like when I go out, I don't want drama and nobody does. I think what we're talking about earlier, how chimps have this horrific behavior. I think there's some of that leftover and people, and I think it comes out when you get involved in relationships and breakups. I think you see that angry chimp come out sometimes. Oh yeah. Alcohol is one of those things. Obviously it affects not just even

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       alcohol, so jealousy too though. Just jealousy as well. Yeah, but also, but jealousy fueled with alcohol, which is a disaster. I mean you look at the people that are in jail right now because they got drunk and got jealous and pulled out a gun or pulled out a baseball bat and just went

Speaker 3:          02:31:35       and then add coke to that and you get confident, confident, crazed, righteous. I'll show her like you live in in some stupid two dimensional movie, like you don't even thinking about the consequences.

Speaker 4:          02:31:48       Can't even cocaine. I can't even. I can't even do it. I never got really into it. I mean, I definitely did it, but I was never one of those guys that was just. I mean I have friends still that go hard in the paint with that and they're like creeping into their forties and they're still every weekend.

Speaker 3:          02:32:04       Dunkin has a great bit on adderall that I wish I had adderall and cocaine that I wish I could share with the audience. You'll have to go see him. Duncan trussell live in New York City. Love you don. During the last end up, he moved. He's happy there. I'm really upset because he liked it. I was hoping he hated it. He's living in Brooklyn. He's like the king of Brooklyn. I can see him like in Brooklyn. They took him in and they gave him fresh hats.

Speaker 6:          02:32:23       He's like, hey guys. Hey guys. You're sweet e's.

Speaker 3:          02:32:30       He did a recent podcast, folks with Aubrey. Aubrey Marcus. It's amazing. It's really good. His live podcasts are incredible, really good. He's got a fucking cult. Duncan's essentially running a colt. He's. He would be the best caught later. He has a house. Omer. Here's a guy who was like the House Ohm guy. Now the guy did ohm and did. Oh, I'm so good. And his name was like fucking bobby. Something like shallow Monga, some fucking ancient ingesting Swami Swami rick or something like that and this guy does an ome in front of his live audience and it was so good.

Speaker 6:          02:33:01       Will you be the household?

Speaker 3:          02:33:04       Really? Yeah. That guy's a house home guy. Every time. Dunkin doesn't show that. Guys going to do owns for them. Oh good Lord. He has a chance that he does. We, we, we've done it before. Like in audiences. We started off a show with it once. It didn't work. It was a disaster. It was a terrible idea. We started off a show where we all got on stage and had the audience ohm and then Duncan went, did stand up, but there were so weirded out by the time they were like, what the fuck are you guys doing? So we did it a couple of times, we did a couple of times to like breath blessed the show.

Speaker 4:          02:33:36       I remember when I had my twitch channel to Duncan does a twitch stream every so often and what is he doing here? He is a Watt James Corden dancing in some way, but he had a mask on and was holding a thing. Of course it's pretty fun to watch. Yeah, he's out of his mind. Don't get and wrote on my vagina mask is that a vagina? Looks like a vagina, vagina, vagina, mask. I had my show on comedy central, pretend time, a sketch show and it was like really aggressive and weird. So I was like, Oh Duncan, you got to write on it. So I brought Dunkin onto right. And every sketch he would hand in, I was always like, all right, what the fuck is this going to be? And it was so insane.

Speaker 6:          02:34:14       Yeah. Like you're playing like a pussy and makes shit that

Speaker 7:          02:34:18       like elves and like the I can juggle knives and then they like each other's ass. That was

Speaker 4:          02:34:24       a psycho. I would have to like just every sketch or try to find what is arable out of it, but I mean there were like obviously moments of brilliance, but were sometimes I was like, dude, what the fuck is this?
