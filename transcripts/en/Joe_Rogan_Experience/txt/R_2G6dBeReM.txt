Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. You don't think of that as being a stress like they think of stress as being bills. They think of stress as being traffic, no stresses, every, all those things are stress, relationships, friendships, work conflict. When you're at work all day and you hate your job, that stress, that is stress that grinds on you. That feeling like when you get out of work at the end of the day and you have that weight lifted off your shoulders, that means you're in a bad job. You gotta figure out a way where you don't have that. If it's possible, if it's possible, find that way. That was me 10 years ago. I was a municipal tax assessor in, stayed in New Jersey. Amazing. It was the just saying all those things together make me want to fucking jump off a roof on Friday. I would literally get depressed on Friday because I knew Monday was coming.

Speaker 1:          00:51          Yeah, I know that feeling. It was fuck. It was God damn hell, but I was making a shitload of money. My mom was so proud of me. I had the four o one k and the six weeks off vacation I was living the American dream. I fucking hated myself. I sat around, I remember this was the turning point for me. I sat around a boardroom table and I was a lot younger than my closest peer and I'm looking at all these older dudes and we're all sitting there and suits and like all were so fucking important, you know, being those dickheads and they're all overweight, they're all, they all have red faces and they're all talking about how they're going to fucking, you know, sneak off to the bar before they go home because they don't want to deal with the fucking family and the kids and all the fucking bullshit.

Speaker 1:          01:27          Like I get it the fuck out of here. I have to get the fuck Outta here, where I'm going to fucking die like this. I got to change my life. And that's what we did. And I kind of threw that away. Resigned from the position, took the job as the strength coach at team quest up in the Portland, Oregon, moved across the country for fucking minimum wage to clean toilets and left that job behind. And I fucking loved it. I loved scrubbing disgusting, Shitty Gym Mats at five o'clock in the morning and not sitting in a beautiful corner office, you know, for x amount of dollars per year. Because I was, I was doing what I loved and I gave myself the opportunity and a chance to do something with my life and get leery of distress. I think that's why I'm kind of veering off it.

Speaker 1:          02:05          That's what it was talking. I was so stressed out and I was riding my bike and fuck, I remember it was freezing cold, fucking raining. And I'm riding my fucking stupid bike cause we only have one vehicle. You and my wife had to go fucking work. I'm riding my fucking bike six miles to the gym and I fucking loved it. It was such a pure, crisp, cold morning and it was just so alive in life, you know? And it was, everything was brand new again. And I was in my mid twenties at that point, mid later twenties. At that point. It's fucking cool shit man. But he gave me the best advice ever, uh, that ever got in comedy. And I, I talked about this in my act a little bit, like I tell the story, but we were hanging out after we did a show one night in Cleveland at the, at this big amphitheater. And after the show I'm talking to these two girls and they're like, you're so funny of that. And I'm like, once you come back to the hook towel, yeah, come hang up. Dave might stop by. You know, I was trying to say that. Yeah, I was trying to pick up these chicks. He actually wasn't gonna stop by the imagine if you were in the middle of boner and she heard Dave's voice and she's like, get off me.

Speaker 2:          03:00          Yeah, exactly. Imagine me. His cock blocking anybody standing in the living room. I'm Rick James Bitch. Oh my God. Is it him? I need a meet him. He's not going anywhere. I'll come in 30 seconds. He was awesome. No rape. He was an awesome wing man cause he was, he was, he's married and he was like a great dude about it. He was just like, you know, he would sit there and like talk to you, you know, with the chicks and then like he'd peel off and then you'd be there with the checks. Man, it was fucking beautiful. And the chicks would go, you must be special. Oh Dude. Well they also just saw you open for dude, it was so, oh look at you. You're glow. There's really, it was nice. It was nice. It was really nice. So I was talking to these two girls after one of the shows in Cleveland and uh, and I'm like, come back to the hotel and they're, they're being wishy washy.

Speaker 2:          03:53          And I'm like, all right, whatever. And they take my number and I go backstage and I'm bitching to Dave and the, the tour bus driver about these checks. And I'm like, you know, they fucking just being on wishy washy and I don't know this and I don't know, it's just annoying. Just fucking hanging out. If you're going to hang out and the bus driver goes, Joe, I'm to tell you what you need to do, man. You need to walk up to that girl, look her dead in the eye and say, do you want to suck my Dick or not? Right. And I was like, terrible advice. I was like, okay, okay. And uh, and I was considering it for a second and then Chappelle goes, don't do that shit man. Don't do it. You're going to fuck around. Joe. You're going to get famous one of these days. 10 years from now, that bitch will be on hard going, Joe Derosa told me to suck his dick and Cleveland once.

Speaker 1:          04:41          That's how I grew up. I mean, I would go out a lot of times during school and I'd just go up, sleep on the mountain, come back, do chores, milk cows, go to school, you know, go to football practice, go home, do chores, go up on the mountain, sleep on the mountain, come back home. I mean, that was kind of how, how my brothers and I grew up and it's just, I mean I just have a yearning for the wild. I mean there some of the coolest experiences that I've had in life have been when I'm by myself and go and do something totally random that, that, that nobody else would really even think about. I say, shit, I shouldn't say nobody, but it's like, you know, in college I'd drive home two hours to my folks' house, then I drive another hour up to the canyon.

Speaker 1:          05:19          By the time I get to the trail head, it's 11 o'clock at night, hike in for three or four hours, find some more sleep, get up on top of the mountain. And I'm sitting there as, as the sun's coming up and three wolverines come up, you know, and circle the lake and it's like back then, you know, in the, in the 90s there weren't wolverines in Idaho. There weren't supposed to be anyway. I mean I was one of the very first or very few to actually see wild wolverines in Idaho. And it's like, had I not been there by myself, experienced in that, in that canyon, you know, if there's other people or other things, those wolverines might not have been as comfortable, you know, but because I was there by myself and I'm the only one there looking down over it, I had that. And there's, there's a lot of opportunities like that that when you have someone else there, you're focused on the group, you know what you're focused on, your conversations, your buddies, your friends and everything.

Speaker 1:          06:07          You're not, you're not really tuned in to what's around you. You're not tuned in to your surroundings. And so there's certain things that I think you miss out on when you've got other people there. And it's not that I don't enjoy that sometimes, but I feel like when I'm there, like there's a connection, you know, there's a connection to the land, there's a connection to the environment, and, uh, you know, you could bring all of into if, if you're, if you're a Hippie, you know, tree hugger, Voodoo type person, you can bring in the nature and the gods and all that kind of stuff into the whole element. But that really and truly is what is what it is, is you're out there with no one but yourself and God and his creation. I mean, that's it. It's all surrounding you. Yeah. And being like that deep in nature where you're actually a part of it because you're not, you're not talking to anyone. So there's no, there's no conversations going on in your conversations there just with myself. But you know what I'm saying? It's like you don't, there's nothing, no anchor that brings you back to civilization. You just seeing wild shit. You're just seeing wildlife. You're seeing animals that would exist that way regardless of whether or not you were there or not. Yeah.
