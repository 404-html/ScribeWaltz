Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Boom. All right. I love when I see something online where I see someone who takes the idea of fixing something or reengineering something you're making, it just goes so far out there. Something totally irrational. Go. Who is this fucking crazy guy yet? I saw, I think the first thing I saw was your Bronco. Um, the uh, icon Bronco, which is just, you took a car, which is the Ford Bronco, the, the 60s and early seventies versions, which are, you know, this kind of slight, it's a cool car. It's a cool old car. A lot of people take the tops off of them and they're always kind of rickety and funky looking and you just engineered this thing to this, to the nth degree with these, these billet door openers and the way you have this step comes out when he's, I'm like, who the fuck is this guy?

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       And I'm so then I started going into your, your website and the two different companies, Tlc, where you take old land cruisers and reengineer those and put modern engines and suspensions. And I'm like what the, I just love that someone like you is out there. Sweet. Thank you. Cause I had no investors that were smarter than me. They said you're fucked our don't even do this bad business. But they were wrong though. They were wrong obviously. I mean your shop is enormous. There's like a beehive. People were constantly buzzing around there working. You've got a hundred different projects going concurrently. You're, you're the Bronco Build. Would you say like a three year wait list right now? Yeah. We've sold 62 of them so far and delivery dates unfortunately are running like late third quarter 2018 which sucks. It drives me nuts. Is there anything that you can do to ramp that up?

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       You would have to just have like four or five of those giant warehouses. That's part of the problem. So like we're trying to move and find a bigger building. We're just about 50,000 square now and it's all ass and elbows like a, I think we could hire maybe three or more guys before we're out of space. But more importantly, it's difficult to find those people because kind of the idiocy of what I do is going against modern trends and American design and manufacturer. So it's really hard to find people that have the crazy skillset that, that we require. Well, that's what really impressed me about what you're doing. W what, what impressed me about what you're doing is not just that you're reengineering things and improving and upgrading, but there's this, this ode to craftsmanship. There's this, this passion in what you're doing where it might not necessarily make sense. Oh, everything we do, if you want to just want to bring up that term practicality, it makes absolutely no sense. Um, but to me that's kind of why we do it and why I'm so passionate about every project we do because I've approached it from the obtuse angle of, okay, that's how it's been done in the past. And you know, stock restorations are great and they fit niche and they're right

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       for that guy. Personally, I have no patience for archaic mechanical interface, but I love and to just static. And then resto shops, hot rod shops. Traditionally they buy this piece, that piece and kind of cobbled together and that's cool. But I always thought, well, you've got this convergence of cad design, you know, computer aided design resources and a convergence of reverse engineering and low volume manufacturing capabilities that kind of are creating a perfect storm where the stupid stuff we can dream up an execute and make a relatively viable business model out of it wasn't even possible 10 years ago. So I've been lucky enough to find enough people that Gri with my craziness and let me not compromise and whore it out, but to really hold the line and keep pushing the boundaries and keep geeking out further and further. Well, it seems like over the last year or so I've been hearing about you more and more and more and more.

Speaker 2:          00:03:57       And then Jay Leno's garage featured, uh, he, he's featured a few of your cars. Yeah, we've been on Jay's show I think four times now. What a fucking trip that places, Huh? Off? Just I was just there on Tuesday. Oh my God. It was just is what I Geek boner I had walking around that place a willing to keep your Chesney because what's crazy is a lot of people don't realize the depth of that subculture. So Jay is wonderful in that. He's almost become sort of a spokesman for the niches and odd proclivities in mechanical goodness. But just in La alone there's tons of dudes with these ridiculous man caves full of wild mechanical beasts and it is so cool. And that's another thing like I never had the intelligence to anticipate when I built the first icon, which was based on the Fj 40 Land Cruiser, I just built it because it was keeping me up at night and I have this idea and after doing a design job for Toyota, I told Mr Toyota about my stupid idea and he kind of sort of off the record bowed and said, go for it full, but we won't get in your way.

Speaker 2:          00:05:03       So I built it to realize that sort of model I had in my head. Then I went back and added up how much it costs and I saw shit, no one's going to go for this. This is stupid. And I talked to some people smarter than me, really big brand people and they said, no, keep it pure, keep it what you want and what you're proud of and you'll build a market. So I gambled and rolled with them and now like 30 plus percent of our clients have two or more of our projects where I was having a hard time getting my head around. People would be able to justify the expense of one of them. Well there's so well done. And one of the things that I was really impressed with was just the Fj 62 land cruiser conversions that you've done. Like cause that for a lot of people that aren't fans of that aesthetic or fans of that, that's just a regular four door suburban type SUV vehicle. They just, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       most people would look at that and they would go, there it is on the big screen when they would look at that and go, oh that's, you know, that's cool. One of those cars. But that's part of the appeal though. Yeah, because it's pure utility. There's no fluff, there's nothing superfluous and people yearn for that. Cause if you look at modern cars, I don't care what it is, longevity, simplicity, durability, no one's thinking about those things anymore. They're priorities are totally different. So a lot of guys go, hey, I, I used to have one of those land cruisers, man, I miss that thing. I go to the dealer, I look at everything, I can buy whatever I want and it's sucks. Everything's plastic, has no soul, doesn't have that utilitarian route to it. So there's kind of a subculture that'll gravitate to wanting to go back to that.

Speaker 1:          00:06:42       And some of them are cool with them stock, but more and more people have been perverted by modern vehicles and like could we make the pedal on the right actually do something and really do something well your, your Bronco was like this beautiful. So I mean that, that, that shape with the icon bumper, it's, it's, it's so sexy to the average person looking at it. It's sexy, but did this, it's like you kind of have to be a fan of that style of Land Cruiser four door with the hatch and the back Land Cruiser, but what you've done is like completely bonkers. This is what, what this is is an Fj 62 and you call them a one 42 right? Because you take an FJ 80 and you combine it with the Fj 62 so what he does is he takes his fucking thing, strips it down to nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:07:31       I mean you could, you could do this way better than me. Paul urea coats it, media blasts it the that you, you take this thing and make it a combination of monitored underpinnings completely redone as far as like weather protection and the moisture protection. It's like at a level that nobody ever engineered before and then you took put a modern corvette engine in it, 450 horsepower plus, I mean this is bananas and you're, you're taking this car that was like how much was where these new, I think they were expensive when they were new, but that means what? 20 grand? Probably 25 grand I think, and engineer's him to the point where they're 160 plus thousand dollar cars. It's total stealth wealth, like the natural decline of the appeal. I find like guys will take these on surf trips down through Central America and not have to stress out or freak out or worry about, you know, the other preconceived notions like you know, people see you're rolling in a nice modern supercar sports car.

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       And unfortunately in our culture is a lot of guys are, I'll look at that. Rich pricking his Porsche, right? You know, it just gets beyond that. So either totally invisible or you get kind of warm fuzzy thumbs up, smiles and it's, it's just a whole different energy. Well then I started going into the sub code. I was what wasn't aware that there was a subculture of people that were obsessed with [inaudible]. It's amazing. There's so many different little Twitter follower that you can go to. We could see the images that they post or Instagram. These cars have this crazy legendary following where people just are obsessed with these old, like it was this, what years are these? These 1989 1900 specifically the ones with the four rectangular headlights, the Fj six two or [inaudible] 88 to 90 and then the proceeding models, the Fj six D, which looks about the same, those were from 81 to 87 why?

Speaker 1:          00:09:21       What gave you the motivation to take this particular type of car and engineered to such an incredible degree? What we started with the older ones, such a forties right? Yeah, the forties which are really sexy, that call, it's tremendous. It's crazy. But we started with a 40 and then the 45 pickups and wagons and the Fj 55 wagons. So it's just sort of the culture of evolved in that those were so archaic because they were earlier standards earlier. Tokes yeah, choke and one barrel carb. Three on the tree and drum brakes. No power. Yeah. So I think as these got older and the average conditions of the ones people could find out there became lesser and lesser, that market naturally extended into these models and people say, well, Hey, well what about a 60 what about a six to, we're even doing the MCJ eighties doing major rest of [inaudible] 91 to 97 versions because again, there's a certain, um, attachment that people will have with them that even though the truck has gone or it had shortcomings that still holds a spot in their heart, which is kind of a big part of the 98% of the battle is already won with icon because the majority of our projects, we're starting with something that already gives people warm and fuzzies.

Speaker 1:          00:10:39       Any of these cars have cult followings and shortcomings, which is kind of the perfect formula to let me revision them and create something like a new option for people that appreciate it. Well, I wasn't even a fan of these, but I became a fan from just going over your website and then watching the vehicles. I watched a couple of the videos and Jonathan has these videos that he puts on youtube. We put sticks, a couple of Gopros and the cars, and you personally take them out, which is very good videos to suck. No, they don't. No, they don't suck it off. They're great. They're really effective because yeah, throw one of those, like the second one down the, that one right there, they're not even remotely sucky. What they are is 100% authentic. Like when you're taking these cars out, you're going over all the different upgrades and different things that you've done to them. That's when you really start getting it. You Go, oh, this guy's fucking crazy. And as crazy as me at $170,000 $20,000 car.

Speaker 1:          00:11:41       Yeah. And that's been a, cause I don't have the budget, but B, because I concur with you that brands like these, if they're not driven out of the vision of the singular lunatic, then they're, they're not worth doing. So I wanted to keep that relationship and personal relationship. So although I just knock the videos out and edit them real quick. But I really want people to understand the level of geekness that we do. And well, you even leave in when you dropped your Gopro and one of them, I love that too. Up here it goes, bump, bump, bump. But this, this is the passion comes through and I'm, I'm a, I'm a big fan of contagious passion. And I mean there's things that I was never interested in before. Like I never gave a fuck about cooking. I loved good food, but I'd never give a fuck about cooking until I watched Anthony Bourdain's, no reservations.

Speaker 1:          00:12:34       And I'd see the passion that this guy has about chefs and about preparation and the, you know, just the, the amount of skill that is involved in creating a perfect meal. And then I started to get, I'm like, oh, this is an art form. It's an art form that I never understood. Totally. This is an art form. Kneeling is an art form. That's the history of the world in a nutshell. Anyone who's ever done a great thing, be it important or not be a he, a chef, a sculptor, a seamstress, a woodcarver, a leader, a political figure or whatever. It was that inner passion that drove it and made it distinct and really matter. So fortunately I'm feeling like I'm not the only idiot in the last three or four years. It's kind of like this, like it's like there's a renaissance. I think consumers are tired of the big box, luxury branded kind of bullshit marketing facade and want like we all already have enough crap in the first world, right?

Speaker 1:          00:13:33       So if you're going to buy another something like you with your pool cues and you're going to buy another pull cue, there's going to be a story to that. Fuck it. It's going to mean something in someone's going to put their heart and soul on that. So I'm starting to see this sort of craftsmen, collective renaissance of makers of people creating stuff out of passion, not out of a spreadsheet and a vcs formula of how well it's going to do on Wall Street. But product first because I think we forgot about that as a country we, we kind of walked away from that slowly seeing that come back. Yeah. It seems recently. Yeah. Recently that's become like all sorts of things. I watched a video on this company called Brooklyn Cut. It was another, a manmade. The knives. Yeah, and I was like, this is fascinating. I never gave a shit about a guy making dies and I'm watching this guy make these handmade butcher knives and kitchen knives. I was like, ah, but you could see like the sweat and dirt in his hands and he's going over the edges and making sure everything's Nice. Like Ah, there's something about that, that I'm as an adult, just starting to recognize this contagious aspect and how important it is and how when you see people that are passionate about things, no matter what it is, like you said, like, you know, make making furniture

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       or anything, it's, there's something about it that gets you excited. Like you're almost, you're pulling some of their energy from their creation. Yeah, the semi. That's the, that's the perfect formula. Because then also even if you don't become a consumer, their price point doesn't make sense or whatever. Just if you respect it and understand where they're coming from and you in turn are inspired to do whatever it is that you know you've been staying in your cubicle and earning your good salary but your soul is dead and you start tinkering at night, get in the garage on the weekends or whatever it is. I think that's key because you know our government for decades now has been telling us just go to target and buy something and we'll all be fine. Which I think is just asinine because that was, the country was built on people trying new ideas and taking risk and standing up for what they believe in and if we just turn into a nation of consumers, then why should anyone give a shit about our opinion and our nosiness telling them how to run their country.

Speaker 2:          00:15:51       This is another thing that I was really struck by when I was tooling around your shop, which is insanely impressive and sitting in your cars is that they'll build quality, like you're sitting in everything. Like this fucking thing is going to last a hundred years, like all of your stuff. And then we had that conversation about planned obsolescence that companies are actually engineering planned obsolescence into their automobiles, which had business. A lot of people always think is like some sort of a conspiracy theory. Like oh, that's, you know, nonsense. They're just trying to do the best thing they can with modern electronics and some of that stuff breaks. But that's not really the case. All Shit. Yeah. Explain to me what you explained to me today. Basically I think in the old days you were dealing with products were designed and manufactured for the sake of the product, you know, pretty simple, linear, pure concept.

Speaker 2:          00:16:42       Um, unfortunately I would blame it on Wall Street more than anything in that suddenly the product in a product company was no longer the priority. The priority was the margin, the scalability, the numbers for the shareholders. So the second you take your eye off of the product being what drives the company, it's going to go to shit one way or another. So like car companies, I mean there's stories that uh, a certain Japanese car company whose name I will not mention actually went and studied, paid Microsoft and said, oh wait a minute. So you're a consumer buys a laptop. When the battery dies, you're retaining that client. And the vast majority of those clients aren't buying a battery. They're buying another laptop. Oh, this could the business this very good. So how racist of you by the way, very racist. You know, I love the whole world baby, but it's doing it and I wouldn't, I don't mean to infer that this is an Asian dish, certainly not corporate priority.

Speaker 2:          00:17:48       It's global is guilty as anyone American has been. That's been the one that people point to because American cars, especially like in the 80s where such shit, they would just fall apart on a regular basis. Yeah. So you know, we could have a long bitch fest about what unions have done to impact product and viability of American manufacturer and all that. It's another story, but I think on the product level, suddenly automotive brands, we're looking at creating a vehicle that by nature the durability of the components within and the complexity of the architecture to facilitate all the perversions that we've come to expect in modern cars automatically set the obsolescence cycle. So it's much better business, although much worse for the future to make a vehicle Wizbang nifty, groovy designed to survive a life cycle of a lease or warranty cycle and then it's off to the landfill and then what happens?

Speaker 2:          00:18:43       Repeat consumer, you come back and yet by another one, Japan's taken it in other nations to and even crazier level to promote the GDP. It's actually hard for you to own your car the older it gets, your inspections become more routine. They go from a yearly to quarterly and on and on and on. Registration goes up every year, insurance goes up. This is in Japan. It goes yearly to quarterly to what was he goes, I believe it's yearly to buy annual to quarterly and then if it's a really old vehicle, it's like monthly and then the [inaudible] scrutiny, like you have one little league, oh and then you can't get your red. You've got to dial that in. So it's been great for, you know, domestic manufacturing numbers and keeping industry propped up, but it's kind of bullshit and shortsighted I think on a cultural level. Well, it's fascinating because they're known for their door ability like Toyota cars, especially.

Speaker 2:          00:19:38       Honda's are the reliability. Like if you own, let's say an Lx five 70 which are great trucks and modern SUV version of the Land Cruiser, they're brilliant. They're strong. Yeah. It'll run forever probably. And it's super durable. But let's talk about your touch screen on the dash. When that bugger breaks, you can't use your climate control and a whole bunch of other things. I already have an Lx five 70 and it's the touchscreens dog shit, but really is dog shit. Now let's flash forward to your, you love your truck. The warranty has expired and that screen takes a shit. Well that the problem is everything is engineered into it. Like the climate control is my point. It's part of no labs for it now. That part is available now and it's federally mandated that it must be available for a specific window of time. That part today, I'm going to make an educated guess. It's a $9,000 module for you to buy that stupid touchscreen. Yes sir. It's shit though. It's not good. It's not that responsive. Okay. So five years from now it dies. It's out of warranty. You'll love the truck. It's nine grant. If it is still available, what do you do? You likely say I fuck it and you go get a new one back to their business model.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       Yeah, it's a, it's disturbing that that's actually an engineered idea that they want stuff to break. That's not what we want when we want to stop. What people really appreciate his stuff that's durable, but your mass consumers to blame ourselves because like I dunno, I get in a modern car like a nice fancy car. Uh, and, and if people go, God, it's 140 grand this you Porsche of blah blah blah, but I drive it and go man, hell on earth. Did they get it to do all this neat shit for only 140 grand? That's true all the way through to people go on to box stores and buying, you know, a backpack for the kids for school and they want in 1995 or 1295 backpack. Now granted they'll replace it four or five times because it's a heartless pilot poo that no one cared about versus buying one from, I dunno, fill center Tanner goods or one of these upcoming passion-based brands where maybe it's an 80 or $120 bag, but the kid alone it, you know, for 20 years.

Speaker 1:          00:21:46       Right. So I think that's part of the reeducation of the consumer that hopefully in turn will insight and motivate manufacturers large and small to re prioritize what drives design. Are they mutually exclusive when it comes to options like magnetic ride control and all this crazy shit that they have now, these sensors that adjust to the fact that one wheel slipping and they counter and all this traction control and stability management and all this jazz. Isn't that stuff just going to break? I mean, yeah, I mean the traditional answer they'd give you if you asked to, you know, top ag engineer, he'd say, oh, but it's all computer based. So as is no veiling pots. Yeah. But their circuit boards that take a shit and solders, that split and code that becomes corrupted and on and on, a nice tire that you can change in the side of the road, exact shits out, you're fucked.

Speaker 1:          00:22:38       And the biggest issue is trying to get those parts to support that vehicle when you are the last of the Mohicans who's trying to keep it on the road and keep it going. You know, most manufacturers could give it to him and as soon as they're federally not required to maintain those parts, they want nothing to do with them. So it gets to a point where like there's cars that are classic that you're always going to get parts for. Like you're always going to get poor, be able to get parts for like a 70 Chevy Nova know because people love them and there's a big market for it. But like a 91 civic, it's like, Ooh, what is that? Your dumpster diving and that's, yeah, you're fuck kind of. Yeah, that's a, it's a weird thing that these, there's some cars and some vehicles that attain this classic status and then they'll always be classic. But like a 2010 Mercedes, like nobody wants that. They just don't want it. I mean, you might want it, it's not, it's not a terrible car to drive. And you can resell them in Cuba for big money, right? Yeah. Pretty soon. Emerging market. Yes. But you know, I think you just got back from there, didn't you? I saw some of your photos. You must have been geeked out and all those cars down there. Stupid. I'm surprised I didn't

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       get arrested though because we went there officially is like a guest of the governing family on a arts mission and uh, cause we sort of anticipated less scrutiny at customs. I carried, my backpack had literally about 95 pounds worth of vintage car parts. So I figured out how to ingratiate myself with the motoring locals in our hurry, which was amazing because I got taken to some crazy hoards and fines of really wild early cars because of that. But yeah, I brought soldering guns, soldering wire bulbs, relay these, all sorts of stuff cause they, the ingenuity, the resourcefulness of that country in the spirit of the people is just phenomenal. We've talked about it a dozen times on this podcast because I love the fact that they didn't have access to new cars. So what they did is they just reconditioned and upgraded and fixed all their old cars to the point where those Yank tanks is what they call them.

Speaker 2:          00:24:47       Those 1950s plus Chevy's and they're, they're just driving them around all over the place. The vast majority of the cars on the road are those or recent import Chinese vehicles because the Chinese government kinda got in bed with them and partnered on import automotive distribution companies. There's, I just wrote about it for 'em, um, the automotive editor for Penthouse in the article that comes out in the next issue, which I don't think anyone fucking reads, but I enjoy writing them. Someone should read a pen house. But anyway, um, was about that and the change in the culture. But it's interesting, they've actually recently passed a federal law there that makes it illegal to export any of these vehicles because as they loosen the restrictions on inbound vehicles, they anticipated potentially there'd be a reduction in the demand. But I don't think it's going to happen from all the people that I talked to from all walks of life there.

Speaker 2:          00:25:42       It's become like a, it's a cultural icon to them. So, and I think it expresses a lot of the human spirit and Cuba and how they've presser veered and managed to make things work with what they have. But I mean, most of them that I drove around in like, you know, you'd be in a 57 Chevy Bel air convertible and it's running a 70s Russian Volga diesel. Really? That's actually, I was in Castro's ex, uh, late sixties limousine. We rented three of his limos and the fleet, or didn't really rent, but it was a friendly arrangement to drive out a couple hours out of Havana to go look at a very rare Aston Martin that I knew about. That's the only one in the country that had been abandoned there. That's a one of one early Aston. So we drove these crazy old rush and limousines to go for there and I ended up on the side of the road twice having to fix them.

Speaker 2:          00:26:40       And then again, like we were, we were going out to hear drunk at like two in the morning and our Russian law to taxi cab broke down. Uh, it was pretty funny. So I have some pretty funny pictures of my cabby looking at me. Just completely incredulous. I'm underneath the car with bailing water, cubing it up, cubing it up. So how were they keeping these things running? How they get access to parts? Are they manufacturing their own parts or they re re anything? Yeah. I mean if for example, it's a tourist, if you forget your toothbrush, you're going to spend three days trying to find a fucking toothbrush. So where do you think you're going to get a brake drum for a 48 olds? So did you stay at a hotel when you were at? Yeah, and some people stay at people's homes. That's a big new trend and I'd recommend it.

Speaker 2:          00:27:30       Same with the, uh, the home restaurant industry that's growing there. The backstory to that is there was a recent limited allowance that allowed private individuals to create small businesses. So people are opening up their homes, they're repurposing these beautiful derelict old buildings and opening magnificent restaurants in them. And well, magnificent might be a strong word because the food kind of sucks, but really? Yeah. Well cause they can't, again, they can't get anything. So like the food that's imported comes from, and what the government said they could import from who they could say it it from. So unless the dude has his own farm and garden and herb resource, which a lot of them do, it greatly limits what ends up on the plate. But so it looks cool. They just take people in and they have like two seats at their kitchen. Yeah, I think they're called Pella.

Speaker 2:          00:28:22       Doris I think is the word. And some of the best meals in experience in discussions in human interface we had were in those environments is super cool. So are they or do they take like a broken part and reconfigure it? Did they make a new one or they, I mean it's everything from Jb weld, chewing gum, duct tape and corks and coat hangers through two incredibly gifted, resourceful, generally the older generation. And I met one guy in particular in his eighties who's very well known down there. There's a big car club called Friends of fun GL. So fine. Joe was a great racer back in the fifties who in fact one the first big Havana rally and there's this magnificent poster that's like the holy grail of Car Geek posters. I still want one, can't find it. But anyway, the second year he went there to compete again and Castro had him kidnapped because they didn't want him winning because he was an Argentinian.

Speaker 2:          00:29:20       Oh. And then they were like, he can't win. So they held him captive and apparently treated him quite well and didn't release them until after the race. But this friends of find Dzhokhar club is founded by one of the local guys who was on his mechanic team that first year and he knows everybody with anything that has a motor and wheels and the, he took me to meet this older gentleman and this guy will not only make the part, he'll make the tool needed to make the damn part. So they're forging and casting. Wow. They're on stuff and it's phenomenal. Like we could learn a lot of lessons and macgyvering shit back together from them. Well that is one thing that we're, we're missing and we're losing the people, the skilled crafts from that have the ability to make metal pieces, which we used to be a big thing.

Speaker 2:          00:30:08       I mean there are people in the hot rod world, it's a big thing. Fabricators are very high in demand because they do so much custom work. But it's such a tiny, tiny fraction. But again, I think if we step back, the thing that keeps me from becoming a depressed drunk is the feeling that that's changing. It's becoming more important to the greater general population. People are more inspired and be it in metal, be it in leather, be it in soup, be it in cutlery, whatever the hell it is. There seems to be a growing trend and people giving a shit and returning back to that. And I think also more importantly perhaps feeling how it changes them as an individual. So like for me, my past life I had a completely different career and I wasn't really, I got into it loving it and over the years like I really didn't have the control and creative input that I thought I did despite putting my heart and soul in it or a past a point despite getting dispassionate about it.

Speaker 2:          00:31:13       And it starts to kill your soul. When I was young and dumb and we didn't have kids yet, my wife and I spontaneously basically quit our jobs. And started our automotive, the first one, TLC. I mean, it could have totally screwed up and not work. I'm lucky that it did, but I think most epically important, it, it, it reinvigorated me as an individual. So I am, I'm more proud and passionate and content, which in turn hopefully makes me less of an asshole. The rest of the people that I interface with him on this planet. So I think big cultural sense, that's a wonderful thing that I'm seeing and it's not unique to America. The, the ripple effect is really, yeah. I think around the world, people are wanting to return to those values. Well, and it's also, there's something about like if, if someone drives, like say one of your, um, Fj forties that you re-engineered, they kind of, they're driving around in a piece of art. It's not just a car that like those volcanic black ones that you, I mean, that's so, it's so, I mean, I con but it's so iconic. Thank you know, it really is it, it's your thing like [inaudible] now it's art, man. That's my whole approach is like it should be, it's a functioning sculpture. There's art. Even in the way your doors closed, like I was, I shut your door. I don't if she knows like in your showroom like four or five times because it's just so

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       well done. It's not, there's nothing wonky. It's just clink, clink. It's just you could feel that and like I think when people drive something that or use that guy's knives or you know, or this clock that we have here, it's like you feel the craftsmanship and in Poughkeepsie on a more important level. Yeah. Whereas like if you have like a cool piece of electronic, it's cool. You know, I love a cool iPhone or a cool laptop, but I don't, I love this laptop. I write all my jokes on him. I do it right. All emails and jazz, but I don't feel anything out of it. This isn't like some guys creation. It's not a relationship. Yeah. Some women didn't carve these keys with her skilled hands and I feel it when I'm typing no to this. It's kind of manufacturer and it's cool that that can be done too.

Speaker 1:          00:33:25       But there's a, there's another level of stuff. There's another level of feeling that you get from functional art. Yeah, totally. And you know, like the, probably the most sort of a two expression of that brand theology is our derelicts, which some people like just don't, you know, I had ran into a guy came running up at a stoplight this morning. I was test driving a 54 desoto, explain what a derelict is because people think you're talking about bums kind of. So basically a derelict is where we'll take a car with epic Patina, like just timeworn natural decay, but not a rust bucket. So like a barn find, we'll take that car, we'll laser scan it, get it into cad, chuck the original chassis and mechanical and everything, and evolve that into a modern, highly capable daily driver. But the art is trying to make it look like we did nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:34:20       So this guy had a light. He's like, you think you're going to make it? I'm like, yeah, I'm good because we got to fix it up. I'm like, Nope, I'm done. Well, what color? You're gonna paint it red? Nope, I'm done. What? I don't get it. So, but to me that's kind of part of the fun. Well what these, everyone does get it. They look like an old car, but you put this desoto up on a lift and showed it to me and it's got this insane, fully independent suspension. And this is the, that's the icons. But the, if you find [inaudible] are elected will come right up. Yeah. Um, or the derelict, not a reformer, but these cars look on the outside as if it's just an old car. But then you look down the wheels like, Hey, wait a minute. What's going on here? And then he got kind of like, oh, hold up a second.

Speaker 1:          00:35:09       You have modern corvette engines in the just bad shit. Oh, it's insane. Like what is this one right here? This, that power power. And asked her what a great man. So that car was inspired by the first derelict, which is mine, which is a 52 desoto wagon. So like in this, it has a one off chassis. We partner with Art Morrison on most of our chassis engineering and we gave it a gold tooth, like a crock because it had a cavity. I was just kind of fun. But yeah, like five 50 horse, a SRT, eight Hemi fuel, Lee, five speed, automatic independent suspension, six piston, hydro boosted breaks, Modern Climate Control, Bluetooth, audio, blah, blah, blah. But all like packaged in head and so it's totally under the radar. Totally under the radar to the point where the knob that controls the old school radio actually controls the volume on this Bluetooth enabled system that syncs up with your phone.

Speaker 1:          00:36:03       Yeah, it's, it's an incredible digital bit. One Addis and not digital to analog, but pure digital audio. Kind of love the, it's amazing what you're doing is so cool because like someone, if they didn't know and they looked out on the outside, they literally have no idea, but then you would look inside and go, wow, that is a really well preserved interior by minute. What's that? It just looks off. I like onions, so if you start peeling back, there's a lot of layers to the absurdities in, in building these and then that video, and she gave me a hard time for my hat after six had, it's all fucked up. I thought it was perfect. That's perfect. There are assholes. I'll give you a hard time about everything you could to save babies all the time. We have too many babies. A trill trollers used to just rip me a new one and over the years it's gotten better is I think people have gotten a more thorough understanding of what we're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:36:57       Well also trolls are like snake venom. You'd get a little bit and it fucks you up, but over time it becomes, you become immune to it and they actually help you. People were like overly critical and assholes and they actually help you in the long run. They really do because they make you understand that. It's just, there's too many people. You can't just pay attention to everyone's opinion. There's just too many fucking people. They just remind you that we could use a little Darwinian trimming of the herd. There's that, but it's also, it's really on them. What is this fucking thing you've got here? This customer total shit like God, this Si the interior was just nuts. Oh my God. It's amazing. That's beautiful. So that's that 50 Buick Roadmaster convertible last on the road in 1958 we, one of our hunters is actually a ups driver.

Speaker 1:          00:37:46       Saw that in some dude's backyard and had tipped us and we grabbed it back up. Hold on. Or what is that? A ups drivers to the best hunters. Really? Yeah. We pay finder's fees to them all the time cause they're delivering packages and they see something covered by leaves guys, guys, fucking car. God, those seats are incredible. That one's now running a about a 600 horse ls, seven dry some. That card is applied now. Who's got that thing that's a calling client. Yeah. Remember the Super Bird, the 70 super broom guys, former. We're building, this is the same owner. He's taking a superbird which is one of the iconic American muscle cars and putting completely modern underpinnings that you were going to do a Hellcat set up, right? Yeah. Which is for folks who don't know what we're talking about cause we're geeking out here. Um, Hellcat

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       is the Chrysler SRT version, the newest of their bad ass challenges beast. Yeah. It's what I drove on my comedy special, the 707 horsepower red challenger. It's fucking incredible. So after talking to the creative team in the SRT division at Mopar, we actually learned that we're not going to go that route. We'd like to, but you talk about complexity in modern vehicles without being too much of a geek that that runs what's called a can bus network. So the electrical network in that car is no longer yeses and nos x's and o's. It's constant data stream. So like even the dam don't light it could be talking to the brake pedal that's talking to the trainee. So it makes it very difficult to really engineer those right. And a non native platforms. So with SRT support, we're actually going to the company that builds their race engines and we're going to do our own scratch built scat 6.4 blown.

Speaker 2:          00:39:31       So we'll, that's our performance target. But we originally were just going to buy one and disassemble it and repurpose it, and we got talked out of that. That's crazy. The all that stuff, but all that stuff has also enabled them to have two keys. Correct. Which is hilarious because one of them that you give to the valet only gives it 500 horsepower. It's like, do you know fucking fast? That is. It's like here, take this tone down version, and then the other one, the red key gives you 707 horsepower, which is incredibly manageable. It's really weird. It's so all the electronics and all the jazz, even 10 years ago when they would do a performance model, they'd just shoe horned in the biggest motor they could find. That car to me is a great example of change, good change in Detroit. It is so engineered to be what it is.

Speaker 2:          00:40:22       It's not just throw a motor in it and sell it. No, they, it's really drivable. It's almost like a gt car more than it. There's a sports car, even a muscle car. It's like a, it feels like a big Cadillac your ride there, but it'll suck it down when you need it. When you stomp the gas on its speaking speak epic. That duality of the two different keys. There's an engine builder out near our shop. This guy a motor, it's like his trainer motor has entry level motors like Ooh thousand horse if that's the alien import. The alien a Ma intake manifold guy. Is that? Yeah, the one that Nelson racing with her legs open. Is it Nelson? Nelson? Tom Is evil genius but oh God, that guy's crazy. Shit. Dual gastic. So you've got a toggle switch under the dash there is dual computer networks, dual tanks, dual injectors.

Speaker 2:          00:41:10       So you've got your low output at a thousand hearts and then it flick of a switch, it goes to the jet fuel tank into the other computer network and now it's like 2000 horsepower. Yeah, that guy built an 1800 horsepower, 69 Chevelle for my friend, the white one. But no, it's like a light blue. We did a white one called on fuck with Hubble. That's the machine. The badges says unfuckwithable and it's quite true other than it's probably going to rip itself in half within five years. Well, it's also, you know, the first corner on the first quarter, the 200 horsepower portion is going to beat you. We try and not do. Right. So although over the years I've been pushing the envelope with more and more and more horsepower and it's hard to return once you've gone there. I, we try and never build what we call a call to sack rides where it's so into a corner of, yeah, wow, let's 2000 horsepower.

Speaker 2:          00:42:02       But it overheats. If you stand still, it won't idle. The AC won't work, you know, or so much power. It's not trackable. Trying to keep everything we do relatively practical, so whatever performance we have, it's in measure with the refinement, the trackability, like the thrift master pickups we're building, people keep asking for more power. Well, 447 horsepower is what we have found to be the maximum amount of power you can put in it without it just being asinine and never hooking up and just spinning tires. Yeah. It seems like they might have painted themselves into a corner with this American horsepower war, because when you get things like the 777 horsepower challenger, and then you've got the Mustang Shelby that has six 62 and what's, what are you going to have five years from now? You're gonna have a million horsepower. What do you, what do we mean?

Speaker 2:          00:42:55       Where are you going to take it to? It's going to, well, kind of like empires. I think if you look at the history of automotive design and trends, there's always a kind of a, a specific, uh, graph of a rise and fall, right? So I think, you know, just as emissions laws came in and impacted the first air of the muscle cars and the starting in 66 with dod and EPA, I think you're gonna see the same thing with these were the, the corporate numbers will never allow that kind of output vehicle to be predominant because it impacts the ratio. So, I don't know the exact numbers, but I would fathom to say that for every three hellcats they sell, they would have arguably had better business selling 26 banger versions and the final corporate fleet, uh, admissions of it is such that that thing eats up so much of their allotted emissions, they're able to produce that, it limits them.

Speaker 2:          00:43:48       So I think that should be a great opportunity. I think Cadillac is showing early signs of embracing it correctly, which is, okay, well let's get back to craftsmanship. So yeah, we can do this motor and it's super sexy and all that. But what about that plastic ridiculous dash that we've turned into? What about all this Foa would, and like, Whoa, gee, why don't we start making more quality materials? Which I think could be a really interesting opportunity because on the other side of the coin, you look at what the Chrysler Fiat ownership a Ferrari has done to Ferrari product. You'll happen a new Ferrari. The Nav Systems, the same thing that's in your kids jeep Rubicon. Are you kidding me? And the plastic stuff that, oh, it, well it has a sexy Porsche as well that looks like aluminum, but it's plastic. It's just the same thing that's in a Hyundai or a key or anything else and I think they better be careful to hold the line of that quality in that tactile, that human interface or what's the point?

Speaker 2:          00:44:44       It's just a badge car. Well, they've made some pro real errors in navigation systems and not keeping them up update and current because if you're going to have all that electronic jazz hip, better, better be good to go there. Yeah. Yeah. Like A, I have a friend who is a Maserati and this fucking piece of shit. Oh my God. The navigation things. Just dog shit. But it's just Chrysler stuff that some pencil pusher said, hey, I already paid for this. Let's stick it in the, no, no traffic doesn't know where the traffic is. Can Update. CanNot reroute you like [inaudible] come on my fucking phone does all this. Was this why like Ferrari and Porsche to a certain extent as well. I actually had more respect for them when they were making less money. You know, when, when like the era of the air, it lasted the air cold like a nine, nine, seven.

Speaker 2:          00:45:27       Yeah. There's no nav three, right? Yeah, no, I'm sorry, nine, nine, three. Well, I can picture some German guy going via not sat drive his car. There's no couple to either fuck you, you know, and like, but they had the balls to say, Hey, this is what we are. We're not for everyone. We have a backup camera. It's a sports car. It is minimalist. Deal with it. Dig It. Great. Don't go buy a Miata. We don't care. We are who we are. Lotus is kind of doing that. They have because they don't do that anymore. No, I mean the little tiny, those little tiny one I've been hearing is lotus just making so much money off of licensing tee shirts and product and crap that the cars are kind of a pain in their ass. So the engineering arm is still alive and somewhat well, but the cars, I mean, they had what, seven concepts, uh, in the last two years.

Speaker 2:          00:46:17       And then production viability of any and all of them is all but gone. It just takes such deep pockets to get one of those coach built versions of those cars. Like what singers doing, singer for it. I see guys like Robin, I I think it's viable that if we are the creative sorts who are smart enough to acknowledge that we're dumb enough to not be the numbers sorts but to build our team and add those people to the team. I think we can make viable businesses out of it. Now the second you want to make 50,000 a hundred thousand, 300 half a million of them a year, I think that is the bigger struggle because I think there's, there's conflicts at core with the efficiencies that those business models demand in the modern world to be considered competitive, et cetera. It's like, you know, with a Ferrari talking about coming out with an SUV because you know some pencil pusher, stockholder of power somewhere like we need more market share. You need to come up with something else. I mean even when Porsche with the Cayenne and stuff like yeah, it's off core, but I can understand the business numbers made perfect sense

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       to grab a Torah egg and package it up in one of those Cayenne turbos. They're a fucking spaceship. Yeah, it's a spaceship. It goes zero to 60 in four seconds and it's a fucking truck and it handles like it's on rails. It doesn't even make sense. It defies the laws of physics. I agree. Same with the new uh, turbo. A Panamera that's, oh yeah. Oh my God. That thing's in love. That trainee, that PDA. See, I want to take a car like that. Package that fucker into an old three split window. Three 56 [inaudible] has an all wheel drive, like six 60 horse PDK paddle shift. But what does that thing weigh? Those things didn't weigh 2,500 pounds. So is that the amount of power for 2,500 pounds? That'd be so crazy. By the time you stuff all that crap in there, it's, you're going to be back up to 4,000 but it's still be a hell of an e ticket ride.

Speaker 1:          00:48:22       It would be insane. The is there like is there a market, like everyone loves those old cars so people love like 69 Camaro's and those old school cars. Do you think there's a market for someone to come along and do what singers doing? Cause what singer is doing is taking your, when you buy a singer car it's technically a nine six four which is like a 1989 Porsche. But it's not really, it's a carbon fiber body that drive train is totally re-engineered. He's using his, he Cosworth still, I think you had a Cosworth engine so he's got a 400 plus horsepower, uh, air cooled like the pre, I mean air cools kind of a stupid way to do it. But there's the people love that sound that the air cooled produces and it has such a mechanical sort of an engaging feel to that. You know that there's that field that those engines have that people fall in love with.

Speaker 1:          00:49:19       So he's got this kind of like very niche market or niche market if you don't like me re butchering that word. But is there a market for someone doing that with an American car? Like building a 1969 Camaro today, like a reengineered Camaro? Certainly. So I think traditionally there's two ways it's been done and there's a pending third way it might be able to soon be done. Traditionally you've got a guy who doesn't give a damn respects quality, finds a pro builder, and there's plenty of geeks like us out there who do exactly what you're talking about. And they build six digit super freak, super trick for that dude. One car and that's it. Build one and all the engineerings applied to that one car. Then you have the professional quote unquote shops that Cmr kit. So they see that car on Barrett Jackson and it sells for two 50 and they'd go, well shit, my friends got some six to nine in the backyard. I can put those together, make them shine, and we'd get some money. If you're talking about that guy fast and loud, aren't ya? I don't know. I have no personal issues with him. No, but it's, it's just like show people see an opera. It's, it's more the wolves, you know, people that see an opportunity. So then that's like Broncos traditionally

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       and, and, and it's not to say anything negative about that community, but the, the shop owners go, okay, what is the perceived tolerance of the guy who might call me and wants a restored Bronco and right or wrong, that may have been 40 grand, 50 grand. So then what do they do? They go and they try and make a feasible business model of delivering whatever the hell they can at that perceived market tolerance. So you either have the guy who won off builds for the occasional funded guy, you have the slightly more commercial versions of shops, which in mass tend to cut corners or make sacrifices to me to perceive market three, you've got the new breed of fools like me and robid singer and, and more and more guys who throw caution to the wind, ignore the established price tolerance, focus on the quality and then try and build a market from scratch.

Speaker 2:          00:51:23       In the future. There's, there's a house bill that just got presented that has been promoted by our, our big trade group called Sema, which is going to really work to create a new federal classification for ultra low volume vehicular manufacturers will take responsibility for tailpipes emissions but get exemptions from larger impact mass market vehicle crash test certification, which makes it impossible. But it look, you know, we can only build 200 a year, 300 a year if that law passes. I think people are going to be shocked how many geeks in the fringes like us and like us that are not branded yet that have the engineering prowess and resources to do exactly what you're talking about. Like that body for 69 Camaro and by that entire body brand new, you can almost buy that whole car via mail order and Lego together in Boston over the winter.

Speaker 2:          00:52:16       Like companies like year one. Yeah. And, and I think there's issues there with quality control licensing deals, making the OEMs and forced quality with the license so that this emerging market doesn't step on its own dick because nothing fits anything. And there's plenty of concerns there, but bigger picture, the capabilities of the shops and the resources and the tooling and all this stuff coming together. If this law comes into play, you're going to see an immediate new subculture in custom vehicles built to a very high level at a more and more feasible price point because we'll all get that, that scale. And like as of today for me, when I'm these Broncos, I'm paying triple a day for the old bronco. I need to restore and modify into my final equation. I'm paying triple what I paid before I open my mouth and we came out with them and they're there.

Speaker 2:          00:53:13       It's a shrinking. So you've kind of fucked yourself. Totally free market. Oh yeah. Ruined it. So if I had had the intelligence and finance, I would a chip Monck away a hundred of them. Well, you, you were talking about this before, uh, when we were in your lot, when you were talking to me about how you got into business. It's kind of on a bet and you chip Monck the way a bunch of Fj forties and tried to create a market. Yeah, he explained that. Okay. Basically I've always been a big fan of getting out of my little box and traveling the world and respecting different cultures and viewpoints, et Cetera, sides and a lot of traveling. I found how it was incredible how often you'd be in a really remote locale where a vehicle is literally life or death, how much the people loved the land cruisers on a whole different level than what North Americans dig about.

Speaker 2:          00:54:04       Artek cute. It's Kinda like, it's Kinda like a safari vehicle. Like no, like life of fucking death. This is what gets you out of the Bush live and people have such a deep affinity for them. So back here in the states, all my cars are over restored. I want something for Fun Dogs, Surfing Beach, whatever. Bought an old FJ 40 like I had grown to love on a, on a prior trip, geeked out and restored it, et Cetera. So I was at a business class extension class. I didn't go to college at USC and we got into a debate over supply and demand. Me and another student and the professor, my theory was supply and demands bullshit. Cause if nowadays if you control the supply you couldn't create the demand. They said I was an idiot back and forth, turn it into a bat and I was given, I think it was six months to drive a trackable market up 30 points and I think it was like a thousand bucks bed or whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:54:58       So um, although I was still active in my prior career in my spare time and was spare money, I had already invested in a couple automotive shops just because I was already wrenching and restoring stuff in my garage and helping these guys with their business model but using their resources cause I didn't have a lift in my shop and my house. So yeah, went out and bought every FJ 40 worth the rat's ass that I could find. I did find you perhaps through, I think about four 30 probably about 30 of them, 30 of them in six months. But this is like thrifty nickel. No, that was like two months real. Yeah. Oh my wasn't working. I would say just road trips rampage by 12 or so, and then I call the transporter and coordinate and send the 18 wheeler to go pick up those 12 and then keep going called the other transport or pick up the next 12 and then chip might come away.

Speaker 2:          00:55:52       I didn't geek out at first. All I did was fixed the problems. They had clean them up really well and then bring them back to market. And this is in the day of the recycler and the thrifty nickel and all that. And it was like shooting ducks in a barrel because hey, culturally people dug them, but there wasn't like a cult around them and nobody was restoring them worth a damn. They would like throw Leftover v eight and a $20 paint job and chrome rims from their brothers, El Camino or whatever. No one was treating them like conventional classics. So that was just very simple premise of give them more respect, represent them better, bring them back to the market. I betcha there's a bunch of men and women that dig them who aren't engaging because of the quality level, what they see. And then luckily I was right and I went back for them to pay me on the bet and no one would pay me.

Speaker 2:          00:56:44       They wouldn't pay, you know the best. So what did they say? It was just a joke dude. Just a joke. You 35 cars fun as all hell. I made out like a bandit. I've made, uh, when you, when in fact those cars, the profit from those cars let my wife and I piss off and go to South Africa for like three months and have a killer vacation when we were young and single. And that's the vacation where we're lamenting these dude's never pay it up. But I'm like, but I think there's something there. And honey, you hate your job. I don't really like mine anymore. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. I love these stories over hits low. We get home. Let's just quit. Yes, we're like, we were in our twenties so we quit. I took like three credit cards, 20 grand, my quiver of trucks, a wing and a prayer took over my friend's lease cause he wanted to move his classic car shop to Santa Monica.

Speaker 2:          00:57:36       And literally like we put a post it note, it was like 1200 square feet. I put like, I dunno, five or six trucks, glass window in Van. I put the trucks in the window, put a piece of cardboard on the door, my cell number, and I'd carry around my old Motorola, you know, Tan brick cell phone, just go about my life. And people started calling it just like third truck we sold. We sold to a dude who's like, hey, if you ever heard of the Internet, we're like, yeah, we heard about that. Sounds like what you're saying, these six, oh, that was barely write and be like, well, it sounds pretty wild, man. He's like, yeah, well I designed websites are like, cool, what are those? So we actually traded the FJ 40. We sold this guy for a website. Wow. It was just, again, serendipity, uh, has been so good to me that just shows you how insane technology has changed in just a short amount of time.

Speaker 2:          00:58:31       We have, one of our sponsors is company called Squarespace and you, you can make a website, no bullshit in about 10 minutes. And it's a bad ass website, drag and drop. If you have a series of images, it's so easy to do for building online store. You got to trade a fucking car for a website nowadays for like I, we're redesigning the icon site, it's going to go live in a couple of weeks. And being the geek that I am like, I'm like didn't want to Redo it. Our current sites, okay, no one's pitch and it gets the job done. But apparently it's written in some language of some company that got bought by someone who got bought or got shelled by the last guy who bought them. And then we got a notice that like, well you know what? Browsers could be tomorrow. It could be in a year, but literally like a light switch, my site won't be decipherable.

Speaker 2:          00:59:15       I'm like fuck. So if I'm going to do it, I want to do it right. So my director and I spent like eight months geeking out and researching all the automotive sites, which I, you know, got a lot of ideas of what to and what not to do and my program or I'm like Mister America for manufacturing, but my programmers in Afghanistan, so other than my server freaking out and then wanting to blog, you're getting hacked from Afghanistan. Once we got that cleared up, this dude is a rockstar from Afghanistan. He's got like 20 young employees. He's fresh out of college. All of his employees are college kids were paying them way board then they're used to making locally, but 10% what I was paying the fancy pants agency in New York that to the old site. Wow. And overnight, like I'll give them all the notes and we'll do the layout at like 5:00 PM I come in at work, like there'll be an email, it comes in at 5:00 AM boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Everything's done.

Speaker 1:          01:00:10       Dude, get me this guy's number rocks the house. Jesus fucking Christ. I'm down with hanging out with Afghanis. I loved that. I love that kind of strategy. I love the fact that you just went for it. I love people. Go for it. Don't sit around and fucking hate your life for the next two days,

Speaker 2:          01:00:25       decades and Afghanis just yet again. Another example of a guy who's like, there's no opportunity here. Life sucks. I don't like my job, but wait a minute, maybe I could do programming for, for you know, the guy followed his passion and yet again, he's doing a great job in succeeding commercially and personally because he put his heart and what he dies and it does a good job.

Speaker 1:          01:00:45       Yeah, there's anywhere it's possible and I love I, one of the things that's come out of this podcast, it's been a surprising and amazing is how many people have done the same thing. How many people that have listened to these podcasts and God and listen to people like you talk and just spread their passion. Go fuck it. I'm doing it. And then just figured out a way to do it on the weekends and nights after work and then put it together and then get a viable business model.

Speaker 2:          01:01:09       I tell you, well, when you and I are 80 and we're not producing, maybe we can't do anything anymore and we sit back and we think about our lives outside of family and and and the people in our immediate circle. I think the thing that we're going to carry the longest term true pride about is having in little ways or big inspired other people and made a positive impact and just like that, like the fact that this podcast you probably when you started that cow, whatever, okay it will be a side thing on and get rolling with it but it's turned in, it's created an entire community and it's inspired other people like I've, we call them our COO, my kudos emails. So just being a goober. If I'm on a blog or I am listening to a podcast and I hear of another craftsmen, I don't care what he's doing.

Speaker 2:          01:01:59       Like the dude with the petrified wood I was telling you about earlier. If I find there's somebody out there following their dream and they're doing something that I think is killer, I'll figure out bigger, small who they are, where they are. Get their email and I always send out an email, my subject lines always Kudos and it's just dude, good for you. Well done. Pitch and go forward. Proudy of that's great. And they're honest and they have to be or this wouldn't happen. But it has turned into so many friendships, opportunities and relationships, collaborative projects like it just, it's good, warm, fuzzy karmic. And for both of you, when the guy receives that email, that is fuel. That's the reason I started sending him is because I started getting them and I noticed how it impacted and empowered me to stick to what was important.

Speaker 2:          01:02:46       And it's everything that, the thing you were telling me about is that, is that going to have a website? The stools that he makes and the, the, the tables in the mix only seen him on Instagram. And there's another one. Uh, tell me where it is again. What is the name on Instagram? This, I got to find it. He's using petrified wood, right? It takes petrified wood and then through the cracks and the petrified wood, generally like a trunk Helen bed diodes in the thing. So like at night it like bleeds light and is like organic. There's this other dude who's in, where is he? He's pedago way. I think the guy takes gourds and he carves them in the most incredible filigree, intricate way. Turns them into ceiling lights. So they broadcast this most incredible spectrum of shadow and color and like it's a, it's a fucking cord.

Speaker 2:          01:03:40       The guy turns it into just like out there, there's the, the Sanchez brothers or family, three generations. Okay. This Mexican dudes in New Mexico or Arizona and I think New Mexico, now they have state licenses to pick up firewood. So they're out in the old growth areas in the desert competing with dudes who are looking for firewood, but they're looking for fallen old growth timber or standing dead. These guys take these pieces of wood and we'll pick up turquoise and metals in that same area. They literally take them back to their studio. And I don't know about the older generation, but I've met the youngest. He'll sit back and stare at that would roll a fatty and burn it and get intimate with the shape of the wood. And it can sit there for an hour or five years until one day he's like, Oh yeah, a chair.

Speaker 2:          01:04:40       And he like sees the vision of the shape in it. So they do like bowls and trays and staircases and tables and shit. Gene of his would take Fletcher's Instagram page. He put up this insane table that someone did along those lines. It looks like it was carved out of a single block of wood and some guy had this really unique idea for the side of a table, like the front seat. When do it, what was the guy's name that made those, uh, the, the table too. I don't remember the gourd or the table. I suck with names, but I'll, I'll email it to you. I wish we could pimp them on the show. But

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       in another guy like that, there's a guy on disability in Detroit who was, uh, increase the most gifted welder. I've PR. I'm a damn good welder. And this guy's a rockstar. So his name's Josh Welton Brown dog welding. He no longer can work because of these, have these massive surgeries in both arms. Fuck. But to just to keep himself alive like his spirit alive. He started doing artistic efforts with as wells. So this dude literally takes scrap metal or old shovels, hammers them, messes with them. Repurposes them and s does these incredible sculptures out of scrap metal water, no dogs and cars and whoa that tables the table. The kick ass. Yeah it doesn't, I don't think he put a source. No look at that though. It's like it's all one giant block of wood and I think it probably is sectioned off on the left side that we can't see.

Speaker 1:          01:06:15       It's hard to tell but on the right side, the side that's facing us, it's sort of like steps like you know what it looks like. He took in cuts of posts, beams like for buys and sectioned them in to like a butcher block pattern. Like guys who are doing that with walls to where from like a paper, it's exactly what it looks like. Right? It doesn't fit with your printer hub of the wood that they don't use for the paper pulp and you leave him at dis similar lengths and you put them at 90 degrees on a wall and you do a whole wall of and cut tree limbs look super cool. We've been doing more and more hardwood. There's a company called urban hardwoods that sells tables like that. Jamie, she would pull pulled out, set up and they essentially, they take really cool old hardwood chunks and make them these really unique tables.

Speaker 1:          01:07:10       They're not perfectly smooth. A lot of them have like see if you go to the gallery, if they have a, you could see some of their, some of the stuff that they do, but then they kind of do this on a large, a fairly large scale and they go all over the world or all of the country rather to find chunks of wood. There's also like a auto aero art, I think it's called, or aero art. The Dude's that take airplanes scrap and repurpose it into furniture and stuff. So cool. Yeah. Well, this kind of, yeah, the here you see these guys actually taking the wood itself. They'll have giant cranes carry these logs. It's brilliant. My Buddy Eric is a a pool cue manufacturer. He's like one of the most sought after in the world. He runs a company called sugar tree cues. It's all completely handmade, all his own and he's one of those guys who will drive around in his truck and if he sees a log like off the side, like he lives in New Mexico, he'll drive like a mile into the desert and figure out a way to chop this fucking iron wood into the back of his truck and then make these

Speaker 2:          01:08:15       pool cues with it with the most detailed figures on mother nature has an inland, just let the natural Turkey, he'll, he'll do points like he'll cut pieces together but he doesn't like inlay. Like some people they'll, there's different styles of cues. Some of them they'll inlay like abalone are little pieces of bone or what? Mastodon. Ivory is one that he uses occasionally for like the joint like 10,000 year old mass did it because apparently that's super prevalent. Like you can find a lot of that stuff and it's actually been growing because of the crackdown on elephant ivory that is actually created a, a strong market spike. I was just learning that and Africa last month, you know, but I used to do fine furniture, um, as a highlight. I used to sculpt, paint pre-raphaelite style, do woodworking. I did leather working, but these are all hobbies, just different things I'd explore and I actually gave a couple minutes thought of making a commercial go of my furniture, but it was like add up the hours.

Speaker 2:          01:09:19       Like no, not going to happen. Like all quarter Sawn White Oak. I'd fume it instead of standing at, which is like way old school way of doing it. That makes no sense. Hume, what does that mean? Fuming? You basically create like a desiccant chamber, like a sealed chamber and you put a desiccant in there that sucks all the oxygen out of the year. So that in turn surface cures the wood. And the longer you leave it in there, depending on the type of wood and the coarseness of the grain, it'll impact and stay in the wood. So like early Stickley, Gustav Stickley Furniture, arts and crafts era stuff, most of that, a big part of its durability is not just that it's quarter sawn, but that it's fumed ammonia, fanny desiccant ammonia is what's traditionally used. What does the, what does desiccant, what does that mean? Um, I believe it's the process of extracting oxygen and moisture and that's what ammonia does.

Speaker 2:          01:10:08       Yeah. Why you try and take a breath and your desk and chamber when you're doing something you're so unfilmed it looks like maybe like a white oak and it gets down to black at 32 hours. Yeah. And they're dreaming. It's not that calculable. It depends on the size and the grain. And you literally, you put it in there and you make it clear so you can just check on the bugger and let it sit in there and darken up until you find that sweet spot they need is take it out and surface, wax it or wireless and you're done. And if you get a gnarly, uh, scratching it, that's not just on the top of the grain, it permeates and really nice and deep. So like that thrift master you saw, that's old Puget sound, sunken logs brought back up, killed quarter sawn and processed and fumed.

Speaker 2:          01:10:56       But then we do a marine Matt seal for durability because of that, you know, being a truck bed. But so I still get a little bit of time to, to have fun with hardwoods. We integrate them sometimes. Well if you decided to do that and put the same passion that you put into icon, I'm sure it would be just as big success. It's just one of those things. People, I mean I have, the market's not as big I guess. Is it more people probably buy cars? Does that make none? Doesn't he make sense? People buy tables, chairs, couches and shit. It's just hard finding something cool. If you want to put like a cool piece of furniture in your house, good luck. You'd have, you know, there's some stuff that you can get it. Retail stores like restoration hardware has some pretty nice stuff, but it doesn't, yeah, he raised, you're like someone just farted.

Speaker 2:          01:11:42       That guy is screwed. More heritage brands and designers, he'll steal your design, lock, stock and barrel and take it to market weight to come after him and go, yeah. Sumi real ambig. Uh, they did a horrible thing with the guys that originally designed the famous American navy aluminum tall chairs. They just stole it, went to market, had it made in India or whatever. But that's actually a very cool story for people that care about these things that it's worth looking into. And they no longer republic lead comment on it. But there was a settlement and the owner of, what is that Navy chair company? There's southern cal company been around forever, I don't know since like the forties. But anyway, he said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're not going to screw me. Just cause you're a big, and I'm little. And he leveraged everything he had to do and did a big campaign to be made right and protect it.

Speaker 2:          01:12:33       So they that the courts upheld his complaint, shutdown restoration hardware's effort, made them pay damages and they protected this guys designed and trademark and brand shouldn't just be damages when someone plagiarizes like that or steals it, don't even get me started. Trademark infringement, copyright violation. We go to trade shows and see designs that I penned and developed and did the cat, did everything myself and house. I've seen the exact product, lock, stock and barrel on a supplier's booth at Sema for sale retail. There's no way that guy say, dude, what are you doing when you call me? You got my cell. Like you can make that so much cheaper than I can. That would have given you my files. We could have worked something out and go, hmm, yeah, that's business and this. What do you sue them? How do you do deal with that?

Speaker 2:          01:13:20       No, I licked my wounds and walk away. Fuck. I just learned a lesson and go fucking humans in business that but not all. Just a few like hunts. There was, there's a rickshaw driver in Havana that I realized after I'd given away all my car parts, I had a tire patch kit still my backpack. And I remember this kid we had, we had had a conversation, I speak Spanish, we'd had a conversation early in the trip and like Ah, he'd appreciate that cause he had been telling me like the, the mafioso that you know, runs the ric shawl rentals, just like in the Greek New York cab deal. If he gets a flat, he's got to bring it back there and they charge him some ridiculous rate to fix the flat and it's on him. So I, Oh this kid will appreciate my kit. So late at night I find him, I give him the kid, he's stoked, takes me out. We just go for a drive and a talk and he nailed it in broken

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       English. She was saying the difference between Communism, socialism and western capitalistic driven things. It's like, you know, there's values in them all and none of them work independent. And perhaps the perfect cultures of the future would be a fusion of socialism in certain respects. Such as, you know, education and medicine would have you and but also the free market capitalist. He goes, but the end, he was explaining to failures of each and he nailed it. Capitalism has no conscience. And to me that that's it. That's it. If we can figure out a way to still have brands and products and consumerism that has a conscience both to its consumers, its shareholders, the environment like just to wake up awareness, not this me, me, mine, Mine, mine, then that would be cool. It isn't it the cat, the idea of capitalism is sort of independent of the human being.

Speaker 1:          01:15:06       It's like the idea of capitalism, this idea of eternal growth that's sort of independent of the human being, but the human being practices, capitalism. So it's up to the human being to have conscience. So I think it's maybe I'd, I'd prefer to hope that what you just described would be corporate TISM if that was well, right, like a corporation, I can understand having no conscience and then it's up to the individuals to hold them to some level of accountability. Yeah. And I also please go just money for the sake of money and capitalism as a priority. I think if we could put that in check and reset those priorities, I think it would serve everyone well on many different levels, but also I think that but what do I know? I'm just some fucking mechanic. No, don't you dare do that. You're dead on. And I also think that it could be taught whether it's just primary education or whether it's being taught at in business school that when you steal you're not going to be happy.

Speaker 1:          01:16:03       You're going to know that what you did. Is it legitimate, you're a fraud totally. And that these, no, there's no way to go round really relevant and important, which goes back to accountability. Do you mean do something stupid? Now I turn around and sue somebody. It's like, well you did something stupid. Whatever happened is saying, oh, I fucked up it. Just being accountable for it. Look what happens to authors when you, you hear about an author or writer, a plagiarizing and they get caught and then someone takes their work and shows the, the original and like, look, there's 50 different examples of this guy taking full passages from these books and, and repackaging it as his own. That guy's done. Yeah, they're fucking done. And that's essentially what these people are doing to do in the same thing when they get called out, they kind of, they pay the lawsuits and the, but they're allowed to keep practicing. And that if we treated those companies the same way we treat those writers, then things would really change. And people looked at restoration hardware and went, oh, you did what? Oh fuck. He goes, yeah, I'm going to design within reach. Yeah, it's more expensive. But they work

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       with these companies. The problem is that history, it's a location. There's a big building. You'd go there and you know, I need a fucking couch catalog and the like, those aircraft chairs, I'm damn jumped it. I am too. But I'm like, not. Once I heard that story, I'm like, I can't do it. Can't support. What you'd need to do is hire someone to rip off their design of their air craft chair. There you go. Beat them at their own game. Fuck. I mean, is that real? I mean, can you do that? I can't think you can get tapped though on education. Um, I think that's another thing that, uh, is so important and misguided. You know, suddenly blue collar is a bad thing. Well, I mean, I've got a neighbor who, a plumber, he's doing fine. Don't worry about him. Yeah, you can meet a lot of money, blue collar.

Speaker 2:          01:17:53       And I think that our school system, not, not only not supporting that, but not educating kids on the Plethora of opportunities in the world for careers and the importance of loving what you do versus expecting people to fit in these silos of doctor or lawyer or where's she at the, I'm going to take a two second half cooked idea and I'm going to sell it, become an internet billionaire with good luck with that. But it's like, it's like the Palae dreams of the Brazilian kids. Like, oh, okay, but I hope you got another plan. But we're not even, we're not even teaching kids how to write a check and balance personal finances in school, not to mention showing them the opportunities the world has and help them identify what they care about. We just kick them off to college where they party for two years in a hopefully on their own, find something that matters to them or they continue doing whatever they thought they were supposed to be doing and don't discover what they love until it's too late.

Speaker 2:          01:18:53       And if they get any inspiration from their teachers or professors are going to get these little nuggets that they have to nurture like little embers the night. It's not like a constant, not a cultural education. Yeah, I think it's, Norway does a kick ass thing where I think it's 10th grade you do an internship with like first they sort of give you the big picture and then you can pick where you want to do an internship and then you do it and then your final year in high school is preparing you for the career future that speaks to you that you've already identified. So when kids go into business right away or off for further continuing education, they care about it and there were already engaged. They're not just getting kind of churned through this system where they don't even know what the hell they want to do.

Speaker 2:          01:19:42       So. So it's just making money, charging them for a debt they'll carry through their professional career. Well, it's also hard because the teachers are so unmotivated here, so it's, it's so difficult to get people and pay them like a poverty wage and expect them to be enthusiastic about presenting limitless possibilities to these kids. Well, they don't even have limitless possibilities in their own life. They're fucked. And some shitbag $40,000 a year job that has a complete ceiling on it as far as growth potential and as far as the appreciation that people have for what they're doing. And that's something I struggle with. I mean, I pay over market in my world and none of my people make what I honestly think they should. But if you look at the business model of it and all the ridiculous cost of doing business and scale in America, not to mention California it, it's like the business that I, you know, I see guys go to China or wherever they go to make something feasible.

Speaker 2:          01:20:39       We can bitch about that all we want. But if we look at the entitlements and taxes and all the crap that's developed around, it's like I di, I think these guys should make double what they're making. Show me the business model. Like literally I've been searching for it. I just finished reading a great book called Spark, which is about Lincoln, which is one of the earliest is still one of the predominant welding manufacturers in America and this guy was doing revolutionary stuff with employee retentions and like he was paying out such big bonuses that the bonus is generally we're 110% of the salary to all employees at all level. He would basically at the end of the year, look at whatever the, whatever the taxable profit of the company was and disburse it as bonuses. So you have to pay the tax and the IRS got pissed and investigated them several times, but it held up.

Speaker 2:          01:21:31       But now they have a proud, educated, healthy workforce, some of which had been there for three generations. There are multinational company, they've managed to stay progressive, competitive and dominant. Having this model of this pay structure in this community that goes against what every economist that, I mean there, this book is still one of the, it started as a Harvard case study and it's become the most common business case study ever in North American universities. From what I understand. And is it duplicated? Is anybody tried to replicate what they're doing and there's been different efforts but not to the extent that they have. And in fact they failed with it and other nations because there become cultural conflicts with the viability. But like I'm studying that, like what could I do that we make that work. But you know when you're, you know, California Shit, we're busy.

Speaker 2:          01:22:33       We've got a one to five year backorder on all the different icons. If I wanted dude's let's work harder. Let's come in Saturday. Let's, I'll work Saturday. Everyone came. It's not mandatory. It's up to you, dude. I, okay. Over time is one thing and that's fair and reasonable, but all your workman's comp and all your insurance is an everything rise exponentially based on you doing that. So like waiting a year, d incentivizing me to give my guys bonus income, increase our productivity and therefore the productivity of the nation on a bigger impact company. Not My little

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       stuff, but it makes it disincentivize you to create more. It's more costs on top. It's hilarious that they were investigated by the IRS for generosity. Yeah, basically. And it took him years and years, but they, they want, hey look, it's so gross. You have to fight the fucking government. Like who are you? Who are you? Yeah, you, you aren't you guys supposed to be just protecting us from fucking war? What do you do? What are you doing? You're investigating generosity. Yeah. No, nothing but fun. It's so bizarre. We didn't bore the car geek cannot hold. No, no. I think you have a wider reach. These, these, these people are, they're, they're, they're loving this. This is great stuff. This is fuel. Do you get a hard time to bring it back to the car stuff too? Like the Desoto that you showed me too, which is just fabulous.

Speaker 1:          01:23:58       Do you get a hard time from people that want to keep everything, numbers matching those Fuckos, those goddamn crazy there, whatever the world, and I'm okay with it. I just, if they call me, I'm first one to go, dude, you're talking to the wrong guy. There's a desoto specialist in Kansas that we'll do it down to the factory imperfections and chalk marks that you love so much and joy. I mean, the way I see it, Henry Ford was kind of a prick, but he was a genius and he said a couple of clever things. My favorite being, there's an ass for every seat, so I don't expect what I do to make sense to everyone, nor do nor that should be a two way street. So there there's a place in that. I think that's a dying market. I think that guy's somewhat of a dinosaur in our market.

Speaker 1:          01:24:47       People expect it to evolve, but there's a finite number of those to Soto's. That's the argument against, but they can eat me. I mean that's a station wagon, which traditionally no one's given a shit about. They were work the hardest, thrown away wet. No one cares. They have the least amount of parts support. They're the most expensive to restore with the least return if you look at it as an investment. Here's a perfect example. I have a 1965 corvette and my neighbor has a 1965 corvette and my neighbor was driving up the hill in his car while my car was being returned to me from Steve Strope at a purely shave. Yeah, he's the one who builds my car. He's nuts. I love him. He's the best. Um, Steve, uh, my car is not stock at all and this guy is bone stock. This guy just ready.

Speaker 1:          01:25:36       It looks at you like you're just a moron. Looked at me like I tried to feed Ted Nugent a Tofu Turkey. It was a really, the look on his face. He goes, what? He goes, what is that stock? And it comes out with this fucking 35 series rear tires and like ruined it. He looked at me like I was a total, it's not even nothing stocked. I the only thing that stuck is the panels the the entire frame or at least stock anymore either? No, he actually got it from, I got it from our motors and, and then shipped it to him and he did all the extra work to it, but the, the underpinnings and everything was already done. He's quite the craftsman. Oh, he's a bad motherfucker. He's in it. He's a mad man when it comes to that stuff. But the point is this guy, but those cars are sort of precious.

Speaker 1:          01:26:18       So 65 Corvettes are precious. There's a finite number of them. And he looked at me like, what the fuck did you do? I've gotten hate mail. Yeah. I've got a couple cars in the line that we're going to do soon that are really going to piss off the purists. But I gotta tell Ya, it's part of the fun. To me that's 63 Ferrari or we're going to build, oh my God, the Ferrari East does urgh just going to lose their shit over it. Whatever. Yeah. Ferrari. Easters Dana White, my friend who owns the UFC, one of the president of UFC. Dana. Yeah. He wanted an Fj for a while, but he didn't like the wait time. He disappeared on me. Yeah, that's Dana Heath. He wants things guest today. What do you got? You got anything right now? Let's go. Um, he has a test to Rosa and uh, he always wanted a test to Ross and as a kid, so he got some money, got to test throw.

Speaker 1:          01:27:05       So, but he had the interior completely stripped out and he had everything completely redone, like modern stereo system. Totally new upholstery and people who have found out about it, but just appalling, I think even changed the wheels. Just how dare he, but you can't do that where you can do it with other cars. It's sort of like, even with Porsche's, you know, the r group, Porsches, they would take those scaled out laws have become acceptable, like Magnus Walker's conditions. Yeah. I love that guy too. He's a character he's been on here. Um, you know what? There's three Ferrari's, his own for rise. You don't do that. They don't do that with also with Rolls Royces, which you're going to differ is that I've done, I've pissed off the rover guys. This is the best vehicle ever. How would you've ruined it? I'm like, well you, what you did unfortunately was get peoples dick hard for something that you don't want to do again because you, one of the things I asked you about it right away, I was like, got defender.

Speaker 1:          01:27:58       You're like, nope, nope, nope. Don't do it. That's fucking do it. Don't, don't fucking do it. Do it. If I cannot speak reason, pull out time defender video. Put a icon. Defender one ten one 10 is colored in the night. Oh my God. It's a fucking work of art. It's a beautiful, beautiful cause. Suck. They're beautiful. But like whoever's sketched, it was a rockstar. Whoever executed it was an account. Everything that could be compromised was comparable. But as you said, in my opinion, these are essentially, they were, they were just utilitary vehicles or utility vehicles, agriculture vehicles, and they get great for what they were, but they don't line up right. But it wasn't a priority. What do you think about like west coast defender, you know when he's doing, he's taking these things and kind of like re rebuilding them from the bottom up. Um, just a different kind of thing. Totally different thing. He's more respectful of the original. The most established company with that approach is called East Coast rover. He c. R they're held in the highest regard with a tradition. The the west coast

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       dude. I haven't met him. I've seen him very nice. Got some media, good guy. But I don't know the depth of their expertise. I do know that that car is a disaster because so many people had been importing them and calling it older than it really was. And then there's crazy stories out there. I mean the federal government has seized, I think 60 68 of them were, they destroy the destroyer, which is fucking crazy. If it's out, if it's past like 95 I think they've been in the right, but then it turned into a cluster fuck because of the story I heard was that when they were confirming by Vin number with Land Rover corporate, they were only for privacy concerns giving land rover the last six digits of the ven. So rovers like, oh yeah, now that's not an 80 full, that's a, that's a 2002 well the repeated the Vin, the last six digits cut repeated through the decades.

Speaker 2:          01:29:57       So a lot of these cars were stolen and not stolen, seized. And in some cases erroneously scrapped whether they want illegal. So I don't know. The ones that I built, I'll only use a u s model cause I don't want anything to do with that shit show. But I have to have much important, we're actually importing a 1946 [inaudible] from France this week. What does a Simcoe, it's, it's uh, wealthsimple Sitka I believe was owned by Ford and they built all sorts of stuff under license. The car that we're going to do as this, it's like a funky two door woody version of the Fiat top Alina that was licensed to the French market to be made by Sim. So, but that thing's so old. It will be easy to import. This video just totally gives me a boner. Well, what you've done is create like the perfect defender but you don't want to do it again.

Speaker 2:          01:30:50       I mean this means he doing but it still wasn't perfect, which is what bugged me. But it has a design game. Beautiful Look, pray, but it's not, it's like it's got this manly utility that's a lot to it. It's just, it just makes you want to own it and it makes you want to drive around in it and deal with all of its quirks. It's so that means some, it's the shapes that just become so satisfying for whatever reason. Nailed it. The shape on them is just magic. Everything. The, the bulge that the hood has, the fender flares. I like how you have in a different color, like a, I like how you repurpose the events and you know, redesign the site. Actually work because they didn't do anything before a whole. Yeah. And there are plastic and you use twisted parts too. Right? Okay. They get some good work to quality. But which she did, man, this is amazing. He fucking, you need to do this more. You do, I'm sorry. You need to make these, this would be as big of a seller as those Goddamn Broncos. Yeah. But I can't get the bodies. And the other issue is the way the bodies are built there, their angle iron with aluminum riveted to it. So like boat builders of known not to do that since World War One. So the rest themselves from the inside out. There's nothing I can do about it,

Speaker 1:          01:32:05       but can't that be done again, like the way you do your FJ forties. Um, so let me explain this to folks. When I got there, you have this FJ 40 which is this a Toyota jeep like vehicle from the 1960s and seventies. And what you've done is, oh actually they went deep into the 80s right. With that shame early eighties the, that you've made a completely new version of it. So it is sort of an FJ 40 but there's nothing that's really from an Fj 40 you've just got the shape that you've completely had remanufacturer in a in a beautiful new aluminum.

Speaker 2:          01:32:39       So we keep sort of core components so that we can still justify an illegal front that it is a resto mod but it has with color resto mod fuck it. Structural portion of the firewall, bib, hinge, headlight, Bezel, pedal back a couple of things. It's a joke. That's why we're hoping to get this law passed cause cause then you don't need the old car. We can purpose build it. This is so fucking pray. The fjs traditionally had rust issues so we crafted out of 60 61 aluminum. But the way that body shape we can get away with pretty crude construction techniques with the rover, there's things about it that you couldn't so you could reinterpret it and then you're probably up legal creek with Land Rover that you'd have to negotiate and come to terms with. The other issue is even the tooling, as primitive as it might be for the Fj, if I was the only geek using those bodies, I could have never made a business model for the amortization of the development cost of the tools needed to make it so other companies that run the company that makes, it's called rubbish. They're in Canada, they have a fairly significant market of which I'm probably a minority too, which guys buy them and build their own thing or

Speaker 1:          01:33:58       this thing is so incredible, which, and looking at the video, this defender one 10 with the internal sub frame,

Speaker 2:          01:34:04       you're into the edit j video now. Oh, this afternoon. Okay. Is this the Fj 44 yup. Okay, so this is a four door, four door version, which didn't really exist. Right? This is also something that you've created. Yeah. It just never made sense to us that it didn't, back in those days when Toyota did do a four door wagon version, Land Cruiser, the body style had nothing to do with the 40 I always thought the 40 would be cool as a four door and actually there's a 40 that's a two data. A client on the phone, it was ready to rock and his wife suffers shoulder saying you can't have it. If you can't take the kids with you on the weekend, you ain't getting it. So this is when we were a little bit hungrier earlier on with the brand. I did a quick and dirty like South Park Quality Photoshop rendering turn one into a four door, punted it to him and she's like, you can get one of those.

Speaker 2:          01:34:52       So I'm like, all right. So I winged it on what the costs were going to be. Lost some money on it, but it took that design and made it our next new model. And then now it's, it's, it's our most popular cause six passengers. If this law passes and you can sort of just build your own vehicles, do you anticipate ever just building something completely from scratch? Yes. Yeah. I mean, part of me is challenging myself because like I mentioned earlier, a big part of why what I do now is appealing to people is that people already have history and story and emotions tied to these vehicles. But I have other stupid ideas that are like based on theoreticals of like if the industrial revolution hadn't happened when it happened and streamlined art moderne continued to prosper and develop as a design style, where, what would that final ultimate vision be?

Speaker 2:          01:35:45       I want to build that car, but much harder to market it because no one has an affinity. It's called the Helio's, um, based on the creek God of the wind. And it's, I would design it to fit on the new test, the platform. And it's like if Howard Hughes drank too many, he didn't drink apparently, but if he got drunk with Buck Minister fueler and Gordon pure record, two great designers, what would that Napkin sketch of look like? It's like, what would he have taken Corella Deville to the country club in big gnarly aircraft and the spired burnished aluminum leather straps, a little bit of steam punk, a little bit of aerospace hot Rod Tesla audacious thing to build it. That sounds awesome. Yeah, I'm, I'm in. I like it. I love it. These, these, these designs, you know, I think a big part of what you're saying is definitely true that people have this connection to these particular shapes that they fell in love with, like the Fj 40 like the Bronco.

Speaker 2:          01:36:46       But I think that your company also is developing that on its own. You're, you're, you're developing your own sort of following. Thank you. Yeah, so I set out, I think you're right. I think long term that's better. Like right now, if I did a vehicle holy of our own design, the titling process follows that of like a kit car, which is not scalable. So if, if that law evolves, I'm, I'm all in. I got tons of stupid ideas. Yeah, that's a weird thing. Right? Like the, the kit car thing, that's like, they would sell a lot of those like the uh, the noble, the noble, which I sell. What does that mean? It's an English car, right? Yeah. And then they just get the body and you have to buy a roller and then you have to have another duty to put the drive training.

Speaker 2:          01:37:29       Or what's crazier is still is the way the laws are currently, and this bill we're trying to get past is literally just the combination of existing laws saying, look, this is all out there, but right now companies can't do it. So if some dude in his backyard has some spare two by fours and some corrugated sheeting and a VA, he can hack together a death trap, take it down. If it has turn signals, tail lights and basic stuff, he's good to go. If a company were to build that same assemblage, it's not legal. So it's just asinine because the companies are going to have the technical resources, the financial wherewithal, the accountability, et Cetera, to create a safer, better, more conscious product. So it makes no sense to me. That's why we're hoping it will make sense to Congress because we know how good they are efficiently reviewing and passing things.

Speaker 2:          01:38:18       That'll further our nation's interest. At least on paper. The companies have enough money to do that. There's the the leap right from the initial investment to putting together an actual car, but it's so much cheaper now. What do you got there? That's the Helios. Oh, it's gotten so much more cost effective and viable to bring out. Highly engineered, no compromise. High quality, low volume product. Is this anywhere online where Jamie can pull this up? This is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. Send send this to Jane where which, where's the Google icon? Helio's, H, e l. I. O. S and it'll pop right up. This is sick. You'd sell a million of these, five of the things. You're going to build that thing and we tried to suicides, attention. His engineering team drafted a letter and send it to me. He was so sweet. That title was like peanut butter for chocolate, begging Ilan to support this.

Speaker 2:          01:39:07       Not on a branded level, but give us a meal. Tesla and the technological, the the engineering support to repurpose the Tesla in this unique platform. But we never got his attention. Somebody needs to get ahold of him please. I don't, I'm not saying Twitter, Bama but Twitter but I'm just ready for whoever wants to support it at this point. I'll do it. Electric gas or diesel. I just need to see it fucking built cause it's just keeps me awake. That's so beautiful. And the, again the suicided, that's Howard's original experimental planes stunt plane that he built his topic age. Wine too. I like the original version of the things. That's a series of panels showing inspirations that we start with a fuselage of the plane. Then we roll it into road going form. Then we start to do the packaging factors and the kid kept evolving.

Speaker 2:          01:39:58       Wow. God this is fucking crazy. Deal panels, Sun roofs that are on cranks with exposed gear and leather ratchet. So there's like that somewhat steam punk interface of the mechanical power windows seem deal. I want like brass cure. See, see the gears rotate as well as Dale. I love it. I love the little leather covered dash to the hand stitched dash and the rivets. If I had the cash, this thing would already be under construct. Fuck, I just built it for myself. But you know all these rich dudes, it seems like someone would have already dove into this. Totally. This is a no lose. This is gorgeous, but it's expensive. Oh yeah. Well no profit. This thing would still cost me probably 1.31 point 4 million just to deny it first right now like yeah, I could make it look good and everything but like engineered finite analyze like balls out done. It'd be at least 1.1 call you Texas friend that wanted a chainsaw. That Ferrari

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       in half. Let's see. He only likes Ferraris because everybody knows what a frog. So that's another promise. Some dudes look at this and go yet, but it's not the Bentley. So those people need to eat dick. They really do all of them. Why are you being like that all at least in and my friend, money's no option. Exclusivity. I had recently in Encino, I was driving one of our things and this like stereotypical Armenian guy with, you know, the big gold and the loafers and the whole night. Nice. He leans over, he looks in peaks in the window. It goes props, but all, I thought that was killer. It was really cool. Armenians, man, I love how they just wear it on their sleeve. There's one of my favorite people and they're like, don't fuck with me. I am what I am and I'm going to protect the baby.

Speaker 1:          01:41:41       They're not trying to change at all. Gold chains. Fucking flying high go baby. Yeah. This is a beautiful thing, man, to creating things like this is, this is beautiful. I love it. It's a dream. I'm stoked. I'm glad you're doing it. I just think it's so important. It's so important that someone out there is creating these bizarre creations, these, these even more important, someone's buying them. Yes, but they're gonna be doing it. But I'd be doing it in my garage at my house. And just kind of wanting to tell. And the fact that you put out, like we said early, you put out all these videos and you put all these, these, these images, even if people aren't, they don't have the cash to buy him. People get inspired. But what you're doing, oh fucking for sure. 100%. Tell me how much is it like a defender to reengineer? Cause I, your video is very extensive. Like you had to reengineer price. How much is something like that cost? Ah, the defenders, the d 90 and the one time we've done two so far, uh, anywhere from 250 to low, 400,000.

Speaker 1:          01:42:44       And that's a car angel. And I have to tell somebody that, but these people that you are building these nuts, they're just crazy. And they go, well yeah I've tried it this way. I one built by and, but these all, they suck. I get what you do. Just do it. So most people who would do a Matthew Perlman's, great guy, he's a guy, does west coast defenders, met them, hung out with them and seen his shop. What he's doing is rebuilding them. Exactly. But brand new, smarter than me. But, but what you're doing, you're reengineering everything. Is there anybody out there re he reengineering everything, the suspension, the subframe, the, the way the, the floor is sealed and polyuria coded and you're just tying it to a stupid level. Um, I guess singer, singer and then arch motorcycles. Mm. Um, those guys I'd say are on par with rethinking every little nuance and going balls out on it. If you ever heard, have you met those guys down in Long Beach? And it's a Keanu Reeves and um, um, ah, man, I can't remember his name. He's a sweetheart, um,

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       guard, guard, guard and Kiana, his company. And they're doing a lovely, lovely, lovely job. Now it's to a guy like you, Google auto drive cars have to be the devil. Yes. That's the devil. It is. What's going to happen? Are we gonna we're gonna not be able to drive our own cars in the future. Is that a possibility? You know, I've been thinking long and hard about that and it's been something that um, different people in my sub culture have openly been concerned and discussing and there's many different takes on it, but I think I'm pretty centered on it. I think actually it's a positive thing and that cars is like the Prius and stuff, you know, started the generation where people don't have an emotional relationship with their vehicle. It's a tool. It's literally like an APP on your phone. It gets you from a to B or even more dispassionately.

Speaker 2:          01:44:42       Screw it. You Uber around and you don't care. You don't have that relationship. So I think culturally as autonomous vehicles and all that continue to grow and evolve, you are going to see them eventually become predominant. And I think we're going to start to see lobbying and federal support of that direction because there's a lot of rational reasons behind it. That being said, I think it will further strengthen the demand for the freaks and the Geeks, the outliers such as my brand because people are going to yearn for that relationship, that attachment, and I think there's always going to be people. Even the guy who's got the autonomous Mercedes at that says commuter, but on the it's like, oh no, I mean this thing's got to, it's caught a manual transmission and there's, there's, there's pedals by the way, and there's three of those pedals and you have to push that one down to get it to, you know, I think there, there's that visceral relationship that is always going to be part of mankind and I'm not worried about it.

Speaker 2:          01:45:43       If I was trying to start a big car company, then I would be worried about it. American muscle cars are one of the only companies that are sticking to that manual transmission model. I mean some cars like the z 28 and the like up until this version of the corvette, you couldn't get the high end corvette and anything but a manual like the Zr one admissions laws are screwing that pooch because it's so much harder for them to certify a manual car than an automatic cause. The automatic, the shifts cycles and efficiencies are much easier to track and to regulate and pretense for in the programming and engineering dynamics of the car. So that's, it's an emissions issue more than anything. Also nowadays, the odd today's automatics are quicker than of course, man. Well that's the Porsche deal. I mean the, the version of what that car public, sure.

Speaker 2:          01:46:33       As to why, but the real answer is based on emissions and efficiency as far as gas and fuel consumption control over efficiency more than honest efficiency because you manual driven, right? You can make it work. I mean the CVT train constant velocity. Everyone said how amazing they were going to be for efficiency and there's, you know, they work with the snowy tears. Yeah, it's an automatic, but it's like if you picture a cone form, it's spins out. So the ratio is constantly changing as you go through your speed cycles, but seemed like a great idea, but at the end of the day and true world use, they realize, oh yeah, no, it was incredibly inefficient just to spoil the fucker. You were deficit of 10% and your fuel economy. So I think it'll, it'll hopefully shift back and like how many more gears can they shoved in our automatic to try and meet emissions as well.

Speaker 2:          01:47:26       Yeah, they're going to eight now and they're doing seven, seven with manuals now too, which is weird. Pain in the ass. It's just, it's an awkward pattern, but again, it's a business case, right? It's a hell of a lot easier to add. Shove a couple more gears to keep that motor in it tighter, more controlled, more predictable rpm band than it is to evolve and keep engineering internal combustion. Make it better for all of your motor runs. So hesitant to do that until it's regulated or competition forces that transition. It's just, to me it's a bummer that a lot of these sports cars at the very least are going by Norberg ring times and there they want zero to 60 times and not how they make you feel. Yeah, but that's what a sports car, it's always been. Most of the Times driving, you're not, you're not counting laps when you're a, you're on little by little to hunger.

Speaker 2:          01:48:17       Rather, you're not looking for laptops. You're looking for pure enjoyment and if you're shifting the gears, you're going to get more enjoyment because you're going to be more connected to the experience. Totally. But, and more than that too, like drove a 97 nine nine three 12 turbo to a friend's House to drive his new 50th anniversary, nine 11 sexy car bitch and colors, beautiful tactile surfaces. Cool tweet. You tried it. It doesn't feel like a Porsche to me. There's so many distractions and knobs and widgets and Gizmos and switches and alarms and babysitters and lawyers on board versus that nine, nine, three yet. It's radically, yeah. Can shake your teeth. Yes. It can blow your eardrums out when you drunk Indian nail it, whatever it is, what it is. It had purity of purpose and I think many brands, but most notably automotive brands have fallen prey to focus groups where they try and create a product that appeals to this mythical large demographic of everyone's going to love it, which in turn I think they step on there we we, because it doesn't speak to any one, it doesn't have clarity, purpose in its engineering and design.

Speaker 2:          01:49:32       It doesn't have the balls to say, I'm not for everyone. This is what I do and I do it damn well. Not only that, it doesn't appeal to automotive enthusiasts. It appeals to people. That might not be the same thing. The you could say the same thing about sitcoms. You could say the same thing. Movies. When someone creates something odd and unique, it's very difficult for other people to agree to it. If they give it to a focus group or a heart for the poor bastard producer, writer it actually sell it because everyone wants to dumb it down to the largest common denominator, the formula they were able to sell to the ads. You know the advertisers last season or what that company's doing a whatever catwalk show. Well let's do a dog walk, whatever it is and yeah, well isn't that the case Wa or one of the best examples for why a business like yours works is it's you and your wife.

Speaker 2:          01:50:23       I mean it's you, it's you and your, and I think that singular vision is consumers are ganging up to demand that thank goodness, but I mean you tick, I've always said you take like every modern four door sedan, car paying all of them black, take all the fucking emblems off, put them on a big empty airplane hangar, bringing it thousand of the general public car geeks and not ask them to name all these cars. Well who makes them, which brand they are. But you know, one would get better than a d plus because they're all copying each other and all trying to not be too out land issue. Too unique or too different. All they're doing is making their blink bigger. The grills bigger, the emblem larger, and it's like there's a loss of, of, of, uh, of individualism. Well, there's only a few that you could recognize based on sort of the iconic grills like BMWs.

Speaker 2:          01:51:16       They have those too. Like jeeps, you can kind of recognize those. But boy, there's a Hyundai that looks just like a fucking Mercedes now. I mean, I've seen it many times. I thought it was a Mercedes and it's hard. It's that look like Aston Martins and on and on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a lot of that going on right now. There's a lot of like, boy, if this was the music business, you might get fucking sued. You're, you're stealing notes. Right? Totally. Do you, is there anything that excites you about modern automobiles that they're creating now? Is there anything that you find that it is a positive? You had a lot of them. Mechanical engineering is mindblowing electromagnetic suspension system. I'm finding quite interesting and hoping to start dabbling in. Yeah, constantly. What did, I just think a lot of it's superfluous and promoting self obsolescence.

Speaker 2:          01:52:03       So I'm like always cautious, but I mean, I'm not immune to it. So like I'll lease a crazy new car once in a while, but I'll do a one year or two year leash and I'll, I'll put it in its place like it's so complex. It's Asinine. It's going to fall apart. But right now is really fun, you know? But usually like within six months I'm bored because it has no soul and then I lose my ass and move on. Well, we'll hop back in my desoto what I, yeah, well there's a total difference in the what? That you're aware you're doing it. Whereas like the Lexus, I love my big Lexus truck because it's, Oh yeah, it's floats over everything and it's just bone quiet. It's just woo smooth. But you're not experiencing it the way you experience, say like one of your fjs or something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:52:52       So, I mean, I've got a lot of clients who maybe daily they're going to hop in that Lx for the boring commute, but then when they really want to engage or with the themselves, the vehicle, the family of the hobby, the locale, then they're going to hop in the icon and they're going to be, it's more of an experience. One of the things that I like about you and what you're doing with your company is you as a person, you have this broad variety of interests and respects for cultures and various things, and I noticed the from following your Instagram, but you, you do a lot of trips and he'd take a lot of trips to these different cultures. Are you doing this because this is something you personally enjoy? Are you like consciously trying to enrich yourself like, yeah, it's always been priority number one.

Speaker 2:          01:53:34       I think as a, as Americans, we have a bad habit of having blinders on and not understanding there's the shit that we get all es or panties in a knot about mean absolutely nothing. On the opposite side of the coin. I think progress is a misrepresented benefit to mankind. I've been to some remote cultures where I think those people are a hell of a lot more balanced and centered and family focused and healthy. Um, then we are in our progress. So I liked, I love traveling. It's super important to me. And as a designer, um, understanding different cultures, approaches to solutions complex or simple or use of color and texture and materials. It just enriches what I do to, to no end. But I think it's, it's really a much bigger picture life thing. Like, um, it's gotten more expensive now I have two teenage signs, but like we'll travel less but we'll, we'll still make sure that to do those trips and bring the kids at least half the time.

Speaker 2:          01:54:40       So you know, we, they have that, that perspective. Yeah. Then the enrichment is sort of, it's not like calculable, you can't like put it on a scale. Like, Hey, we should go to Africa because it's worth this. It just changes the way you see the world and how you, when you make eye contact with someone, what you're expecting out of that person or what's your open to experiencing from that person. I think travelers open themselves up to such a crazy greater level to be able to embrace and experience and you just never know what's going to happen. And what one trip or handshake or eye contact will turn into them. I'm on the board of this kickass charity called go campaign. You should come one year. We do a really fun cars and casino night at the shop. When do you do it? Joel Mchale was our host this year.

Speaker 2:          01:55:32       We do it the first weekend. Amaze us. We love him to one of my favorite humans. Um, so you know we were in, in Africa a couple of weeks ago and yeah, we were doing the safari camping glamping thing, but we were in Tanzania because we're, we're starting a big fundraiser this year with go, um, to create a new center like children's center. Cause, um, if you have physical or mental disabilities in many African cultures, it's, it's frightening what happens. So there's, um, there's ways to impact the world outside of buildings, silly cars for rich guys. But both experiences, you know, doing something for a children's center, Tanzania, those relationships, those experiences all helped me gain a different and better, hopefully more valuable perspective on everything down to how I'm going to build a car or what material we're going to use. So I think what we were talking about earlier about teaching inspiration in school and you know, teaching people how to think and how to fall passion, that it's a lacking component.

Speaker 2:          01:56:37       I think you could also say these sort of the same thing about traveling and experiencing different cultures exchange program. It's not richer. It's not as appreciated. Or as, as, as um, uh, what's the word? Um, it's not as encouraged, you know, it's what it is. Well and sadly enough to, unfortunately nowadays a lot of your global travels, you might as well be at the third street promenade in Santa Monica or Paris or Barcelona or wherever because this big box commoditize the tourist experience has become this kind of homologated experience that's one size fit on you. It's the gap or whatever. It's the same box stores and think more and more. It's like Disneyland travel unless you really work hard at it to find the culture in the people, so that's kind of scary. Yeah, you got to really go looking for it. I found all of garden, the Sao Paulo airport, so they go, sorry, olive garden, but you see like what Detroit is doing in the airport.

Speaker 2:          01:57:39       They did a great example of this hopeful, this renaissance I speak of and hope they kicked out all the generic bullshit, typical airport concessionaire food, Chili's, brands, all that crap. Right? Then they invited in local restaurant tours, local chefs, local craft beer makers, gave them all killer deals. He said, come and rich, our airport communicate Detroit, why people should be in Detroit. The Passion, the craft of Detroit. Be a part of that, which is just killer. It's my friend's restaurant just got put in there and he's super stoked. It's, it's, it's, it's a win win. Detroit was depressing when I was there, but one of the things that was kind of cool was that I was seeing like a resurgence of all these very small sort of craft businesses and that'll be the only thing that'll ever save Detroit, in my humble opinion. And he has, you get past the topical depression. It's a very inspiring place. Yeah. There's, there's, there's opportunity because the real estate is insanely cheap and there's, you

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       know, there's young people and young people or young people everywhere, they have hopes and passions and they, they have the internet and they look around, they go, that's a fucking building right here, man. Let's just do this. And boom. Yeah. Let me look what Shinola is done. Am I, I dunno, which I know have done. Oh, should I know this is cool brand that does watches and I thought it was like, Shit. I know. I thought what it's like a term that's, that's where they got the new shoe Polish. It was back a pre World War II and that's where they got the name from it. You don't know shit from Shinola. They're parallel being more product with purpose and story. So like, Oh, you bought that, you don't know shit from Shinola. This is Shinola. A watch. Oh, it started as a watch. Then they own Filson.

Speaker 1:          01:59:27       Then they've got a wonderful American northwest cultural icon, leather goods outdoors company. So yeah, they, they do, uh, bags and watches and bicycles and leather goods and they're getting into notebooks and all sorts of stuff. But their whole thing is the cultural renaissance of Detroit supporting Detroit. They're opening up facilities in old worn out industrial buildings, re-purposing. I'm training local kids to build it like their watches. They're assembling their own movements in Detroit and training people because there wasn't a skillset for it. So it's those efforts times a billion at companies large and small, that are the future of our country. And I think, uh, most poignantly with Detroit near term. Well. It's one of those things I think that when you, you see like a lack of opportunity. You see people sort of try to create their own opportunities. He engineered by either stealing the copper out of your building Sao Paulo style, steal your car, redistribute wealth problem solved or yeah, like stopping and thinking and engage.

Speaker 1:          02:00:39       You can't find a job. Make a job. Yeah. Well Detroit has a real problem with them stealing pipes and stuff that they're doing that from a lot of buildings, rain, but I just do love the fact that when you've, you find a dip, like we were talking about with Cuba where they don't have any cars, so let's just figure out a way to make these fucking cars weren't making it work and what you're seeing in a lot of these other places where there's not a lot of great jobs, there's not a lot, so they're creating their own possibilities and creating that. It's happened for so long that it's become a source of pride for their culture, which then makes it that much more important. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Listen man, you've got a busy company to run and I really, really appreciate your time and I'm sure you have a lot of stuff you have to get done, but it is important to do and I really appreciate you taking the time to really come to the shop and kind of really understand or lunacy and uh, it's an awesomely impressive, awesomely impressive and inspirational.
