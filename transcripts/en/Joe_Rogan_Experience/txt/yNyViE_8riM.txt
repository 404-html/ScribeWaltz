Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. I'm doing everything I can do possibly a cryo machine. Um, you name a hyperbaric chamber. Everything I could do, I'm looking for the edge because everyone's, they get, they got a champ. I'm, I'm broke. They got money. They. So imagine what they got and now I'm scrambling to get everything I could get. You know what I need to get to the next level. I know, I know, I see it, I see it, I see it. Any man and I'm me, like many other people rooting for you. Thank you. Oh, just, it's frustrating when I see you getting close to these fights with guys like David Hay and then it falls apart to sucker. What happened when they said he was going to fight you? I went over to England champion. They showed me nothing but love. They seen the true character of who he really is.

Speaker 1:          00:39          He ain't really a good dude, man. He's not a, he's a businessman, but he's also like a, you know, he's a, he's a, he's a weird dude man. You know what I mean? You, I shook his hand. We said we had a goal because be grateful, great fight, win, lose or draw for either one of us. Um, and everything was set and he did everything they needed me to do and then he just did the, uh, he felt he was looking for another deal. And the truth of the matter is, I heard this from the inside that he was like, it's too dangerous, you know, that's just the bottom line, which is what they often. He's a fairly small heavyweight. Y'All smash them up. That was an easy one for me. That was a layup. I was like, oh, look at him on one smashed.

Speaker 1:          01:14          And he was scared. A little steam in his eyes. I'm from Brownsville. I got one thing I can smell when you're, when you're scared. I'm from the same neighborhood as Mike Tyson. Ready Paul? I know. When the man scared, I went up on him. Joe. I looked in his eyes. I seen his lips. He was trembling. He was scared. I could smell it. I'll be like, oh, this is a layup layup champ. This is an easy one, champ. Yeah. What does he wait? He's not a, it's not only a heavy guy. I had that one child. I could see me just snatching them Vegan.

Speaker 1:          01:44          I'm eating bowls and cows and all dinosaurs. Straight animal for you. There's a lot of momentum in your side. It's just a matter of getting a fight signed. The heavyweight division right now, it's pretty exciting. It's not in the face done the big fights, but I'm just saying for, for Brown, those people to try to act like they had, they were going to grab the bull by the Horn and not be able to come with a deal. You know, they had to. I think they have a couple of days until we go to bed. Like if that was the case that we should have just went the purse. But I'm ready now. I'm ready now. I don't want no more delays. I don't want to play with this boy. Another boy. Don't want to pay with this man. This young man with a family. I don't want to play with him.

Speaker 1:          02:25          I want the bellarine because he and my way up. I understand, but he's in my way and it's nothing like people don't want to stand like you could call me crazy, but that's what. That's okay. Look, I my mind and my mind. This is like a already written destiny. I was allowed of shape. I was dealt and now I wanted to kill myself and now I came back with nothing behind me, but the people, the people's chairs, everywhere I go, he's in my way. He's just like a tornado come and he's a role. I'm a terrible part. He just said my weight because I got a bigger picture champion all the belts I want to people around the world, all the belts chair. I want people all around the world and be like, Yo, here's my story. I got to. I don't have a great record.

Speaker 1:          03:04          I've got like six or seven months, five, six months. Who knows? I had ups and downs. I've never been considered a great, but I fought guys who will tell you on the low man, he get busy. Excellent. Is Louis. They'll tell you guys who, who, who know me or who, who boxing acts. Chris Bird. They say, you know what, Shannon never read that. Never really seen Shannon. They never really seen Shannon. I'm honest. I'm not. I'm, I'm keeping it real. I ain't never seen me. They going to see me win this fight. Get done. They're going to see me. They gonna see the real shit. They going to say, wow, we didn't know he had a lot of talent. We didn't know. Let's go chat, chat. They won't see it for real. This is a lot of suffering. Pain Champ and a lot of love too because they're all around the world.

Speaker 1:          03:44          They see them. Let's go champion. They feel in the positivity and they said, you know what jam we behind you man. The people should. That's not happening in boxing champ and that's, and that is another reason that's fueling me to look at the box and you look at the state of the heavyweight division. It was flat before me, champ. Couldn't go, was doing nothing was sticking up division for gears. Grab whole, grab, hold. Come on. Champion. Heavyweight champion of the world. You're supposed to be the biggest project. Sports. You're supposed to be out there doing interviews. You're supposed to be Muhammad Ali here to stay around people around kids around the world, supposed to know that they had, which had been the world when I was out there trying to campaign and even to this day, you ask somebody who's the head we're championing rural. They don't even know. Nobody knew. Nobody knows now. And he was a white guy. Yeah, but ask them now who's they don't even know. Nobody knows. Nobody knows. Now you go around and I keep people call me one thing, champ. Yeah. They say chat when you're fighting. Exactly. So that's what I. that's what I'm talking about. Bringing back the imagery to the game.
