Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Byron bowers, Ladies and gentlemen. Hey, what's going on? What's up brother? Man, thank you for having me. My pleasure. What's the latest and the greatest with Byron? You've been traveling all over the place, man. Check your instagram out. Oh Man. I just got back from the Dominican Republic a few days ago and uh, it was a very interesting experience. Yeah. Yeah. Like anytime you go somewhere tropical you like, man, this place is beautiful. And then by the third day he'd be like, man, this is, this is horrible politics. The way they treat people. Oh. So you see the balance of, you know, everything. Especially as a, you know, uh, being from where I'm from and being black and what's going on, I'm always in exotic places when cops are killing black people. So it pulls you out of the situation and it lets you see how fucked up things or for like the Haitian people.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       But yeah, I mean at pretty much every third world country deals with all kinds of fucked up shit. Yeah, like way worse than we have it here. It puts things into perspective. Like, I often think like if, if United States wasn't established just a few hundred years ago, if that didn't happen, like what would the world be like? Like what would most of the world be like? A lot of these countries that you visit where you deal with insane police corruption. Like I've, I've had friends that have been pulled over in Mexico and you know, the, the, the cops basically just straight up tell you like, do you want to get out of this? Give me some fucking money. I think I had a situation like that coming through Tsa, but I didn't realize until they let me go. But they held me for a long time where, uh, in Dominican Republic because I had on a button up shirt that's denim, like the one I'm wearing now.

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       And they was like, take your jacket off and I'm precheck. So when he would come precheck it's like a white privilege. And I'm like, I'm not taking off my shoes. This is not a jacket. This is a shirt. So in the Dominican Republic, yeah, doing this and I'm flying out on glasses and stuff. And they was like, oh, okay, oh it's a shirt, huh? Come through. And then as soon as I came through there was like this your bag. And he started trying to take my cologne like, yeah, that's flammable. You can't take that on a plane or my umbrella, you can't take umbrellas on the plane. That's a weapon. Sorry. And they just held me there and we just made eye contact with each other. I'm like, show me on the chart. That's all I kept saying. And then after awhile they was like, you know what, you can take it, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       So after a while they just gave up. Yeah, they gave up because I was like, okay, if I check the bag can I take everything? And he was like, yeah, so what I did, I unloaded all my bags and start rearranging things so I could put it so I can check it, can make it back to America. But once they saw me doing that and they saw how neat I was, like every time they touched somebody had to put it back a certain way. They like it. It's just going to be a waste of time, but even us. Yeah, but don't they have rules? We have rules as far as like how many ounces of liquid and stuff like that you could take on a plane. They do, but it made it over there. So that's why I was trying to get them to explain to me like why exactly it probably made it over there because the people that work at Tsa over here fucking barely paying attention.

Speaker 1:          00:03:18       Well you take it everywhere. I take it everywhere. But how big is your Cologne? First of all? Clones. Stinky man when we were in that I love. I love it. I know you disagree with Cologne. You know what I mean? Just a great political point. Disagree with Cologne. You more Alpha though. You know what I mean? You can choke them out with your muscles and I could choke them with the smell. I'm not exactly sure where to go with that. But. So how big is the Cologne? So you're like three point something ounces. Okay. So I think you could bring on like four ounces of liquid. Yeah. Isn't that how it works? Yep. Toiletry bag. Yeah. It was a total tree back. Now mind you, I just, I kept, I went from Montreal to some from Montreal, from New York and Montreal here to Dominican Republic. So this same luggage has been like everywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:04:07       So what were you doing down in Dominican Republic? Oh, I met up with some friends of mine from college, some African homeboys and I hopped in on their trip because they visit the Dr Lot and I wanted to see what it was like and I snuck it a lot. Like I came back sore. But yeah, I did a lot of time in the water morning, evening and like late afternoon. What's beautiful for that? Yeah, that's one of the cool things about this tropical climates, the uh, the oceans down, they're amazing. The ocean. It's amazing. Some of the reefs wasn't as you know, not like when I was in Jamaica or when I, like in Hawaii where everything just comes alive and it looks at the city, but it definitely. You do feel like you landed on another planet to me and you're flying like I'm cruising over, you know the terrain.

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       You mean when you're swimming? When I swim? Yeah. Anytime I snorkeled like it's that it's that other world experience to me. Yeah man. I'm a big fan of the water, but the sharks fuck it up for me. Yeah. I'm just not going to get neat. But yeah, that's the thing about it. Sometimes I keep looking around like especially if it's not a lot of things in the water, but I saw squared that was the most beautiful thing I saw from this trip was just like 40 baby squid all lined up in a row that looked like they'd just been born, you know, Popo and they were just there and I didn't even know they was squid. I thought it was like fish with interest in his fans because it looked like, you know, like a lady just doing her dress like that. When I got close I could. I realized that I was at a tentacle part a and I was just locked eyes with him and I was like, oh, this is the most beautiful thing. You know, Duncan trussell. Yeah. Dunkin has this new virtual reality thing. It's a virtual, it's an htv

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       vive. And uh, you put it on and you, you actually feel like you're underwater. They have this program because I think it's called deep blue or something like that. Something blue, um, but you put it on and one of the uh, reality programs that you put on is an ocean one and you're standing at the bottom of this like ocean area and these fish swim by and it's, it's not a hundred percent realistic because the graphics on totally there yet, but it's like 85 percent realistic. And as amazing a whale pulls up to you and you get to look at the whale, like you look in his eyes. But like, I dunno if you've ever used any kind of virtual reality. I'm pretty new to it too, but you get a full 360 degrees so you can look down, you can look up, you can look everywhere.

Speaker 2:          00:06:47       So this whale, as it's in front of you, you could choose different spots on the whale that you look at it, you can look at its eyes, you can look at its tail. It's fucking fascinating. And it lets you know that, you know, within a hundred years from now, probably not even, probably more like 20 the 20 years from now. Oh, this is it. Is this the program? So this is it right here. So you, you stand there and you're looking around like that dude's just looking around with these goggles on and this is what you're seeing. I mean, you're seeing it feels like the actual ocean. Yeah. That's, uh, that's basically what it, that's basically what it looks and feels like a, that's beautiful right there. It's crazy that that's what is it like 79 percent of the earth or some point that is. Yeah, we looked it up the other day.

Speaker 2:          00:07:35       It was over 70 percent of the earth is water and 95 percent of that is ocean water. That's amazing because almost like how they say our bodies are made up of the same. Not Quite. I think a bodies like 60 percent. They used to say it was like 90 percent water, so finding out what it is. I think the human body is actually only 60 percent water, something like that. Maybe. But I've, I've, I've experienced virtual reality, the one where you could just travel everywhere around the world. 60th five average human bodies between 50 and 65 percent water averaging around 57 to 60 percent average percentage of water and infants as much higher typically around 75 to 78 percent water. Huh? That makes sense. Dropping into 65 by one year of age. A little water balloons. It's probably why the scan gets crazy. Like the older we get, the water's drop it in, drop it in there. Then like I said, the percentage goes down. The older you get. Oh Man, he probably just drinking too much. He'll get wrinkles and stuff. That's actually Collagen. That's, um, that's the wrinkle thing is the last set of your skin gives out your body stops producing college incorrectly, but you can mitigate some of that moisture and you know, some people use creams and shit like that, but at the end of the day, time, time when

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       certain ways. I definitely use creams. I use cranes. Do you clone? Yeah. All the things that stink things. Well I can't use, I can't use dyes and perfumes and lotions. How come it, it makes my skin, it dries my skin out and make it break out perfumes and lotions. But you can work alone. Yeah. I wear Cologne, Cologne last, a certain amount of hours and it lands on your skin. So, you know, look at you. You clump correctional Atlanta. Scared. So dedicated. Have you always worn Cologne? No. Well once I got into it, my mom, like I was raised by my mom, like sense of smell is just so strong, you know, so it was always frigates around and to me that's the first like that. That can alter your mindset or your mood. Like when you smell something good. Yeah. Yeah. It's an anchor.

Speaker 1:          00:09:48       It'll, it can cause like a, like a mental trigger. Yeah. It brings you back to that place like certain smells, like smell of apple pie. If your mom cooked up a pie or something like that, you could smell it immediately. Transport you back to that good place or bad place or bad place. Like yeah, like I like, like sexy smells, so I like to be reminded of something that's pleasant life a woman, smells, you know, so I don't wear like hardcore masculine. But I liked the smell like a rose, like you like to smell like a rose. I like to smell like something fresh like that, you know? I'm learning a lot about like, yeah, it takes me two hours to pick out my fragrance, you know what I mean? But hold on, it takes you two hours to pick out your fragrance. It's just in a day or like when you go to a fragrance store.

Speaker 1:          00:10:36       When I went, when I went to the fragrance store. So you're that dude, you're just wandering around. They're touching this one? Yeah, smelling it. And if I don't get like a small, like erection, like that little erection. Yeah. Like if it don't turn me on in a sense it's not the one. Huh? But you know, it just like, you know, like when you feel the energy of a lady or you know, whatever you're attracted to the sound of a motor when it goes by, you know what I mean? Well I'm with you on that. Yeah. Yeah. They've said that on with engines that actually like when you hear an engine revving, it actually raises men's testosterone. But why? I wonder why it's uh, it's like, I don't know that anybody ever driven a car with pipes, which is rare in California that have custom pipes.

Speaker 1:          00:11:24       But you think it's rare? Yeah. It'll be like for as far as like loud and those fucking things are everywhere really. Yeah. They cracked down on them here. It's not like in Georgia. I'm from Georgia where you can, you can get a Honda and put in open exhaust. I have a quarter inch and take the stuff off us. He that stupid. If you've got a Honda. Yeah. You shouldn't do that. If you're a four cylinder, that's awful. I did that before, but my friend had a Cobra Mustang, 68 a and you can hear that car coming down

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       the street, but when you hear in a real car with a real motor is almost like a, like a tiger growl in the song. It's just an energy that want to release. When you press the gas, you know, so that it makes you, it just does something to you. What's little explosions? I mean it's controlled explosions essentially and that's what it engineers, right? It's just the steel explosion container and all these pistons are in there and they're all firing. I don't know. As much as I know about cars. I really should know more about like how engines work. Like I really don't know that much. I kind of know there's some, I ain't gotta have cam shafts and you've got to have some cylinders and there's a spark plugs and night, some shit and some fire explosions going off. I don't really know know, you know more about me when it comes to cars.

Speaker 2:          00:12:43       I know the simple like few air spark gets it going. That's it, yeah. Yeah. The simplicity of it. But you are in the cars to your conversations. I definitely liked them, but I can't get into it. We'll displacement and offsets and the correct suspension and steering. You don't know about all that stuff? No, no. I just know what I like body shapes and what it feels like. But don't you enjoy like what it feels like when you drive them? Like you have a nice car when you drive that thing, like you know, like it has like a certain feel to the way like when you turn corners and stuff like that. Certain responsiveness to it. Yeah, that's true. I definitely know that but there's not, I can't dial it in. I can't put that in a computer and be like, hmm, you know, like I need my suspension adjusted.

Speaker 2:          00:13:28       Should I go with this call? Oversell a colo visit. But that's the beautiful thing about the Internet. You know, you have a bmw so you can go to a BMW forum and then you can say, you know, what is the deal with this year? A three series. Like what's the best suspension set up for handling and some some people like comfort, some people like handling. That's the real trade off is because if you really want the car to sit flat around corners that it has to have a little more stiffness, still feel everything a little bit more and I feel that and I liked that. Like I had enough for for 83, which to me the best, but it was the best car or home. Those portions are sweet man. Those are underrated cars to be able to fill a cart. The field role do this, like you're on a boat was amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:14:15       A lot of cars don't give you that feeling. The boat feeling like you know the street is uneven when you drive it now instead of just the flattest most paved street, you know, you could feel the wave in it. Oh, because you must have pretty stiff suspension. Yeah. That car came like that though. Yeah. Well those older cars were way more responsive. They were way lighter too. Like if you go to like the really older porsches like the old nine slash 11. So the long hood models, I think it was like 65 or 64, I think it was two 73. Those models, they're really light, like that's a 2000 pound car a lot of

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       times. So you feel everything when you bumping around those things? Yeah, it feels more like a go cart, you know. And that was ignorant with my, like I had to buy tires for it and they was like, uh, it's 83 and I'm like, it's 150 horses. I'd take it to the tire place. And he was like, yeah, you need these $150 tires. And I'm like, no, fuck that. This car, the only got 150 horses. Let's put some van tires on it, you know. And I bought two brand new van tires. What's a van like times that were going on a van. Why would you do that? Because it to me it's just a tire. Oh that's ridiculous. Slot slid on the freeway or bunch of times just stopping and wasn't used to not having abs. Automatic breaks. And every time it stumped the brakes, you know the car was slide on the freeway, but I would stop in enough distance to where a slot and not hit the car. So you had antilock brakes? No, I didn't. I didn't have it. What kind of car was this not for, for those? Didn't have any brakes? No, not 83. They didn't come to like 86.

Speaker 1:          00:15:57       And you put van tires on Jesus Christ. Dude, that's a sacrilege. That's terrible. It was. It was what you learned lessons, you know, anytime you work on your car is cool, but you learn your lessons. You learned about Torque, torque, applying torque to old cars and plastic pieces. Breaking. Yeah. And all types of stuff that, you know, antifreeze tastes like. You know what? Any furniture, we drink it in the fridge for you if you don't drink it, but you have to rework working on a leak or changing something in drips and it gets in your mouth and Oh, I get it. It is sweet. It's like koolaid almost doesn't really taste that good. I would have no idea. It looks disgusting and antifreeze looks nasty. Looks like, like, like nuclear waste or something. Yeah. So yeah. You learn your lessons with cars by. You still carrying those old ones.

Speaker 1:          00:16:51       Yeah, they're different, you know, you can actually work on them. You can open up the hood, there's stuff you can change and swap out. You can go to pep boys or whatever by a part. New Cars, man. You open up the hood. It's just like a computer. It's like opening up the back of a imac or. Yeah, that's true. He have no idea what the fuck's going on there. And everything's connected to some sort of a, you know, a computer management system. So, you know, three, three and the bemer it's three. Three what? Three computers. Really? Yeah. They ignition switch when you put the key in, talks to this module, reads the key code and it talks back and allows the car to crank, but all they have to go through the main computer also. Wow. And I know that because I know Colin and I studied engineering for two, my senior year and I had to, um, I had to snatch a remote start system, faulty remote start system out of the basement when I got it. So I had to go under the Dash. Rewire everything.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       You did all that? Yeah. Wow. Why'd you do that? To take it out, but you did, you know what you were doing? What, what made you decide to embark on that? That seems like something I would want to take to a dealer. Well, I learned how to do install car stereos. Oh my friend, when I was younger, he used to steal a car. Radios. He taught me three basic things to start a radio is like the cars, you know, power ground, you could turn the radio on and the remote wire was, makes it switched on and off. Would you really don't need a remote wire at the test or radio just like you got jumped, started answering. But you know, you know, you start to learn a pattern of things just like the universe had patterns when you learn a combustion and stuff like that. Just the pattern is was important to me.

Speaker 2:          00:18:39       That makes sense. No, the universe has a pattern and then the universe, because now I'm the bigger pattern scale, you know, but the media, yeah, the university has a pattern of the way it runs to me. You know what I mean? When it comes to seasons and things like that. The revolution of earth around the sun, you know. But Stereo's also had that pattern. That's an interesting comparison. Well they definitely have like whenever you're dealing with electronics, you have to have power in the ground and then there's a bunch of other stuff that goes on. I've installed some stairs when I was younger, you know, but, but they were easy back then. It wasn't that hard, you know, there wasn't that, it wasn't that complicated. You get to everything pretty easily. Give up the dash pretty easily. Pull out the existing stereo and you just have to figure out where the power is and where the wires connect.

Speaker 2:          00:19:28       You tie everything up. It wasn't that hard, but I would never fuck with a new car. Like, you know, like a new lexus or something like that. Try to take stereo out of one of those things was more tough. But if I break it down to you like this coding and stuff is all if an statements right. If end if, ands. So if this go there, go here, right? Ones and zeroes, right. If there's one poem here because zero boom here and it's just a bunch of that going on, right. Computing at one time. That's the pattern, right. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:20:02       has it as a simple. Yeah. Well it's more complicated than that. Right? Well it's not going on. What does a bunch of those all in one was. It's amazing how well these cars work when you really think about it because like I'm like I have a lexus and I have a key that is actually in my wallet. It's a credit card and that's my key. So I don't ever take a key, I just get in my car and it always knows it's me. I come near it. The light goes on near the side. Mirrors the side. Mirrors have like an underside light. The light goes on, the handle illuminates let you know you there, it opens for you, you get in, you just press start and go. It's crazy how often it works. We get never fucks up. Yeah. And that's cool. It is cool.

Speaker 2:          00:20:45       But it's just when you think about how many different things fail in terms of electronics, you know how many different people's iphones start fucking up most cars, especially when it comes to like your card, a German engineering or Japanese engineering, something like that. They're so fucking reliable. I mean the, the amount of times that they actually do fuck up is people complain about it but it's pretty small. And while I was in school and I learned a study in [inaudible] 95 when it came to the Lexus and the Honda, the car, we're pretty much perfect [inaudible]. So they had to add features. So now have you noticed where everything is about the features and less about, you know, and there's a cycle of cars having more power and cost saving gas cars having power. That's just a pattern. It's just gonna happen. Um, but yeah, it's all about the features now.

Speaker 2:          00:21:41       Even with phones, it's all about the features. Yeah. Well for sure. I mean with new cars tube is like you have to have apps and all sorts of different things that your car can do. But those older cars, the one of the interesting thing is how long some of them lasts. Like I have a friend who has Alexa, so it was a million miles on it. It's a million miles because the gs $300, the fourth member. But model it is the older, bigger ones. The big one. Yeah. That's, that's the one that's supposed to be an asset car asset car. Yeah. Like, it's gonna appreciate really because yeah, you know, the foreign cars are just now starting to appreciate versus the old American cars. Well you mean foreign, like Japanese cars. German cars are always kind of appreciated, right? Like porsches. But yeah. Porsche's and stuff like that, but as far as like the little light.

Speaker 2:          00:22:33       Yeah. Japanese cars and like the Lexus. Well, you know what's really appreciating now it's kind of interesting is those old Nissan skylines. Yeah. The ones that became the gtrs. When you look at a gtr now, it's very different looking, very spaceship looking, but the older ones are kind of like more retro and kind of cool looking. But the oldest ones now are starting to become really valuable. Yeah. Like the early nineties and late eighties. Yeah. It's just hard to find one. It's not molested because a lot of people took, um, and they did shit to the fenders and they fucked with this. He fucked with that. I just told her ticket about that the other day we was talking about cars and I was like, yeah, it's hard to find something that you could find one. It's not been molested. She was like, what in the heck? Explain to her what molested was and what retard tranny is. Retard. Yeah. For a car. Yeah. We don't turn over. It's like when they don't move forward with something is holding it back. Yeah, you called it a retard retard, like have you tried to turn the car and it won't turn over retarded. Slow like it won't turn and then mostly using like the Europe, Europeans use it

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       most of the time. Do they really use it like a standard term? Yeah, like some of the blogs and stuff. It's like, you know, it's amazing. Do you read blogs? I'm cars. Yeah, like when I, because I work on my car myself. So yeah, anytime you are trying to diagnose a problem, it's more reading then going actually going out to figure out what it is. That's interesting. You read all that kind of stuff but you don't read up about like suspensions or different tire offsets or anything like that or no? How come? I don't know. I think uh, I don't, I really never really have what they call a super car up or modified it too much, you know, so everything I get, I used to just ride basically with it and I can have fun with that because I'm not a high horsepower guy.

Speaker 1:          00:24:33       I just need it to be quick and like turn and handled well and I just live dangerously within that. You know, you live dangerously well. Those cars, like, you know, you have a BMW three series. Like those cars, they're handled. They handled great anyway. Like my friend Eddie bought one of those a few years back and he had before that, like an old shitty bronco and when he got that a bmw three series, he was like, oh my God man. He goes, I like driving now. He goes, I never knew that driving was actually fun. Yeah. Like I would go, he would go, he was a, I would take Mulholland just for fun, like just decided I'm gonna take it this way if no longer just because I'm bored, you know? I took, I was in Topanga like last month with the car. The road is a road as a ward now.

Speaker 1:          00:25:23       Pure warped. My role is a warped from what? From just breaking and like his driving Topanga. Topanga. How many times did you do it that day? I was filming something like a documentary and I went hard that day, but it was already working for. I went that day. You were filming a documentary in your car? Yeah. What are you doing? Um, somebody was doing a documentary on creating comedians create content and I was showing them like what, how, how I get inspired and what gets me in the mood and the car is one of those things, you know, because when you talk about, you're talking about engineering, so kind of you know, and putting it in comedy set. Yeah. And I'm just a balance between the left and right brain, the logic side and the creative side and the balance between the two because my style is basically that balance, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:26:22       Oh, you don't know. Well, I'm, I'm trying to get. So you get this by driving, is that what you're saying? Yeah, I've been driving is something that's, that's beautiful. I took him to a junk yard also cause the death of a car and the rebirth of parts when you need it, you know, the life and death, the Yang Yang of that. And I took him to paint a cane because I did la, I did acid in Topanga. And it's a good place to. Acid. Yeah. So at one part we kind of an original though, a lot of acid going onto panga. So when you, when you out there, you got nature right? And then when you turned onto the street, you have all these sports cars, you know, which is beautiful. You got a manmade creation. They also has life to it. Are you looking at just trying to follow you? I get it. I get what you're saying. So we found and I took traction control off and it was four of us in that little car and we just slid around a corner a corner and uh, those guys were scared, you know? Yeah. You're sliding. Yeah, it was a residential street. They should be kind of nervous. It was a little nervous and I was a little nervous, but that will made it fun. You know, we did that together. He has tricky though because that's kind of a lot of people drive into Topanga. Yeah. And that's what adds to the, the edginess of it, just like my set, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:27:42       is that line you can call that edginess or irresponsible on public roads, you could call it that. Yeah. What I don't, you know, once you get into that, that's like trying to figure out the offset of attire, you know what I mean? What do you mean? Those little details, little details of what's fucking dangerous. There's no, that's not a little detail when you slide in sideways on a residential road. No. One thing that's a little detail. Yeah. That, that, that could be the difference between, you know, a man that was close in like somebody to call nine one one, you know, uh, yeah. That's irresponsible, right? Isn't it? No, it's fine. No worries. Just edgy to scuttle sliding around. Losing control of your car on public roads. No big deal. It's like when you, we will be at high school at parties and like a, a gun would come out.

Speaker 1:          00:28:35       Oh Jesus, you thought the Party was fine. But when that pistol came out, that's when real excitement happens in school. Dudes are pulling guns out in your parties. Yeah, right apart. A party wasn't good and lets the cops showed up. Jesus Christ. So you have the cops didn't show it was all right. And so when guns were getting pulled out, what were they getting pulled out for? Oh, people probably was arguing about something. Some. How many times did you see this? A. Not a lot of times this will happen. It just what happened regularly, like, you know, at the night clothes and you started going to nightclubs. Yeah. These things will happen, you know? Yeah. What do you think about all this shit lately? That it seems like every couple of days there's some sort of a mass shooting. Well, the, the, the problem with being a black guy from the, those areas in your thirties, that's just what happens, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:29:27       So, um, but in your twenties at any man really took me in the twenties is more fight. It's like that military, like we're not going to take this, Yada Yada Yada. But you know, and I could imagine like I'd be imagined sometimes I look at it a funny way like this, my grandmother, this is nothing, you know what I mean? Because they were like hanging people and throw them over the bridge and the county where she's from and shoot them shot guns for fun. So this is like, you know, to me in her mind she's like, oh they need an excuse now who is doing this? What do you mean? Like they were throwing people, hanging over bridges, shooting them for fun. Yeah, because I'm from the south, so things are a little, you know, little old school sometimes it's not that long ago when certain things happen, you know, like Jim Crow and like these things aren't that old, but you still hear the stories.

Speaker 1:          00:30:22       You're, you're, you're brought up a, I don't know, I don't want to say racist, but you brought up to like these people are their enemy or be careful when you're on that side of town or like they say you might not come back home when you leave the house. So when you're talking about is white people doing fucked up shit to black people like that. This was something that was so common that it was just talked about all the time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you still have nice people, you know? Um, it's an honesty in it that I don't see anywhere else because when I got out here people act like racism didn't exist and it affected comedy like three years ago. You know, who the fuck was acting like racism doesn't exist. What would be like, oh, it's not, come on and it's not that bad at or who was in that?

Speaker 1:          00:31:07       People would say that it's not that bad. Like we don't. When people love to say there's no racism because Obama's black. Hilarious. That's one of my favorite ones. Yeah. Like people. And I was like, well I'm still shellshocked but my situation is different because I was treated unfair within my own community. Then I left my community, you know, like I had the whole light skin dark. My sister, light skinned, fair skinned. I'm dark skin, you know? So you were treated poorly within your own kid because your skins too dark because of that one thing and you know, single mother being looked upon differently and we are in the Bible belt so there's a lot of like not having nice clothes and bullying Brian and then I got sent to a white school when I was bad at my first year. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:31:57       So to me it was like this whole, this whole world is crazy, you know? Yeah. That's the weird thing, isn't it, that the racism inside the black community between light skinned and dark skinned people. Well it isn't until you go to Brazil and you see, um, where they all Brazilian and see the racism Brazilians or you know, you started hanging out with other cultures and start seeing the separation with the other coaches in saying that what I call a pattern of human behavior. Well there's definitely a pattern and human behavior and trying to find groups that they belong to and then an alienating, isolating themselves from the other groups.

Speaker 2:          00:32:41       Yeah, that's a, that's an unfortunate thing that people do and they do it. The feminist thing to me to separate man from woman.

Speaker 3:          00:32:48       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:32:50       and then you got the, you know, the gays and then you got what's going on in between the black people in the cops know. I mean we just two groups that are opposing each other more so now than ever. So you think feminism is separating men from women? That's what they're doing. I think it's a, it's a slight shifting of,

Speaker 3:          00:33:12       uh,

Speaker 2:          00:33:13       especially with the guys, you know what I mean? Oh, male feminists, male feminists and male feminists or barely real. It's weird. It's a weird situation. You know, he just parked his joint. Keep up with you. Male, male feminists. So seriously, barely real. They're barely real. There's a very tiny percentage of men that are actually male feminists. The smallest percentage are actually adhere to those ideologies. The vast majority are doing what's called virtue signaling. Michael Shermer has got the best expression. I wonder if that's his expression. I see it everywhere. I see it more often now than ever before. I think since he's been on this podcast, but um, what they're doing is just trying to make everybody think that they're amazing. They're there, so virtuous there, so ethical and so moral and so open minded and fair and they're thinking that they've, you know, they identify as a feminist, but most of it is guys that just can't get any pussy. Well, I thought I was the truth. I thought I was a true feminist, but I was talking to this young lady about how beautiful women are and I was like, they like, I like to be in place with beautiful women. They like cars once good, you sure. And she was like, you objectify women. And I was like, well, I guess I take the five women then, you know, you see that thing Jamie and a thing I tweeted the other day from Cosmo Cosmopolitan magazine side-by-side cover. It was a retweet from the amazing atheist.

Speaker 2:          00:34:41       We'd a side by side cover. One of them was white men who objectify women are the effing worst. And then, and the very next cover it showed CV. It's identifying men's bulges during the Olympics. Yup. It's hilarious. That's hypocrites. Yeah. But I always had confirmed, confirmed men who objectify women are effing horrible. Thirty six summer Olympic bulges that deserve gold and then it's just guys abs with their, you know, speedos, looking at their cocks. It's hilarious. People are fucking hilarious. I agree. And I feel like, you know, when I talk I try to be as truthful as possible, but I only learned through my ignorance. You know what I mean? You only learn. Well I learned, we learned through my ignorance, but you learned a lot from shit that you didn't know I'm messing up. You know what I mean? Yeah. Or Yeah. Or not knowing.

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       Yeah, I mean I think there's a, I think feminism and all these things, this is like a giant scale, right? And then there's, there's feminism that totally makes sense to me. I think there's a lot of women that, um, they did get treated unfairly. They work with assholes who just want to fuck them or want to treat him like shit because they're a woman or they have power over them and they know they can pull some stuff on them that they can't pull on men. I think that's 100 percent real and I think there's a lot of women that are awesome. They're, they're, they're cool, they're creative, they're funny, they're powerful and you know, to call it feminism or whatever it is. They're just awesome humans. It happened to be women, you know, so I think like the, in some ways the idea of feminism is to recognize those women for what they are just awesome human beings and to sort of shield them and protect them against a lot of sexism, a lot of misogyny and a lot of shit that gets directed and their direction.

Speaker 4:          00:36:40       And I know it's real. I've seen it. It's 100 percent real. Yeah, that's true. It's a lot of sexism, just like anybody that would say to you that there's no racism that is fucking papaschase. Of course there's racism is racism amongst black people, against other black people. Yeah. I experienced that. This, I think there's just ignorance, just foolish people and I think in a lot of ways it's not even the people's fault. A lot of what we are is a measurement of who our parents were, who their parents were, the neighborhoods that we lived in, the people that were exposed to and the think process, the thought process that surrounds these areas. It's super difficult to escape. You know, it's just really hard for people to think outside of the box. It's easier now because you might live in a bad neighborhood with a bunch of silly people that don't think very well, but you have access to the Internet now. So now you can start to take it into their ideas and consider those ideas and say, well, maybe these fucking people around me are asshole.

Speaker 1:          00:37:37       Well, the problem with the Internet is, and I got friends and family that don't have the thought of going to the Internet. You know, that's the problem with the Internet, not the Internet. But when you know that situation, you know. Um, yeah. So if I have a conversation with somebody and I was like, why don't you just google it? And they was like, what I'm asking you. Yeah. You're, you're hanging around with Chili people. Well this is just real people. I'm related to, you know what I mean? Yeah. There's nothing you can do about that. No, but it's like you got to leave them behind. It's tough though. It's tough. It's tough, man. I mean, I would have left, but I realized once I left home, the smarter, the only person that's educated or the person who thought outside the box is gone. You were the only person that was thinking outside the box for the most part. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:38:26       Yeah. Well, what do they think about you being like this sort of subversive comedian? You know, you're this like minded, free speaking. It says wild shit onstage. You know, they don't get it. Uh, the funding. No,

Speaker 1:          00:38:43       to be honest, I'm here to tell them they're wrong. Nah, they don't. You can just tell by the look in their face when they see it. Um, isn't that what they, it's not worldstar hip hop. Is that what they're expecting? Yeah, that's what they found. Like, look at this dude gets slapped, know. Yeah. So it's just a different. I've, I've, I've socially, economically, mentally crossed over, uh, but it happened so long ago that you felt like you can't relate sometimes when you're talking to them. Well in a sense, but the thing, you know, there's things you find interesting, uh, they might not find interesting and it's always a thing in the black community when they was like, how a desegregation in the black community because it took the doctors and lawyers out of the community but don't think, I don't want to hang around them. Niggas ain't trying to sit around motherfuckers that drink alcohol all day, you know what I mean? And they tend to talk about how to invest in what percentage the bank returns versus, you know, uh, our, uh, you know, ira or something like that was like, he tried to like. So I see. I understand why these things happen now. Why people move out. Yeah. Yeah. You know, um, but that's the journey that I'm on. And then I try to go back and his spleen, those things, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:40:06       there's amazing aspects to all sorts of different ethnicities, different parts of the world, different groups of humans. There's like amazing aspects of their culture that they, they have that it's gonna, it's gonna be weird if all that stuff gets lost. But I think ultimately what human beings eventually you're going to have to figure out is the only things that matter or like, I mean it's really like basically straight Martin Luther King Jr. Yeah, judge a man by the content of his character or a woman who are you. But we can identifY each other so easily by what we look like or where we're from. It's so easy. So, so many people are like so proud of being from a certain part of the world and in some place I think in some ways I think it's kinda cool. Like armenians talk some shit about Armenia and armenians. They'll smack the fuck outta of play, man.

Speaker 4:          00:41:04       They're fucking loyal to that and they don't even live there anymore. Man. That's like being someone who's really into being american and living in south America. You know, you talk shit. If you talk to shift to an ex pat like that lives in south America, you know, if you're like, man, America is shit. America's fucked up. It's ruined the world. He's like, yeah, that's why I'm here. I'm here, bitch, get the fuck out. I got the fuck out because they didn't want to deal with anymore that you can't. Like there's something cool about that. These people that come over and they are unapologetically like one of the things I like about armenians, I don't mean to. I'm not picking on them, I'm complimenting them. They're unapologetically masculine. Those dudes will were fucking wife beaters. Tank tops with a gold chains hanging down. It's hilarious. They're like rockets.

Speaker 4:          00:41:52       So old school. I like it. A lot of ways to test out or they look like they looked through. You sometimes. See I don't want to lose that because I think there's something cool about what that, that, that community represents. I don't want to lose that. I don't think you, you lose it. I hope not. I mean, I'm from a situation, like I got african friends and when we met they had to sneak me in their home. Um, because I'm not african really? Because you're from America. Yeah. What part of africa? They from Nigeria. Okay. It's funny like saying, saying someone's african, it's like you don't fucking big africa is so many different countries in it. I was a, I think it was umeboshi. I was watching some documentary about Namibia last night. I think it's a mirrored bia. No, maybe not. Maybe Namibia. Namibia. Extremely under-populated.

Speaker 4:          00:42:49       It's enormous. It's like bigger than Texas by like one quarter, which is Texas fucking huge. So this country is bigger than Texas by more than one quarter and I think it only has like 2 million people in it. And uh, they were, they were showing the little, this one village that they visited, how little rain father was. They had one inch of rain in three years. It's crazy, man. When you look into how these people live, like I like watching documentaries that highlight human beings that just easily could be you or me easily if just this happened. And that happened. And her mother gave birth in this weird part of the world and they're just people, man, they're waving. These kids are real playful. They're waving to everybody. they, they're waving to the camera. They're so excited that the camera people are there to film this and they're out there cooking and it's so dry, it's so dry, you know, you look at it and be like, where are they getting their water?

Speaker 4:          00:43:47       Where's the fucking water? There's no water. This is crazy. They had a on this documentary, they had a problem, was a show. It's actually called uncharted. So this guy named jim shockey and he travels all over the world and he's a professional hunter. And he visits these communities. a lot of times he's helping people. He had to, they had to take out some crocodiles that it'd become addicted to eating people or customers accustomed to eating people. And this one, they had to stop a hyena that was killing all their livestock is hyena would come in and just mangled their livestock. And uh, they had to get up in the middle of the night and then drive there super early in the morning before the sun came up to observe this hyena because he would only be there for like a few moments. The early, early morning.

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       Then we'd Bolt. But it looks like a werewolf like this werewolf. It's tearing apart this cow and I'm watching this and I'm like, man, these people are living in these little houses near this. This fucking thing is out there. Just mangling their cows. They have no water. It's dry as fuck. It's so fascinating. Men. Anyway, dot is a country in africa. Yeah, of course. there's other countries that are tropical. There's other crunch. it means africa's, it is insane how big that place is. I haven't even been. I was going to go this summer, but I found out that you have to take malaria shots and I'm like, I'm not going to have a malaria medication to my kids. Fuck that. Fuck that. Those shots. I'm not a fan of. The malaria ones are supposed to be particularly abrasive on your body. And there's, I don't want to see my kids walking around poison just because I thought it would be cool to go see an elephant.

Speaker 2:          00:45:25       It's natural environment to live on my own. I mean, I think it would be fucking cool to see for sure. Yeah. Africa, the africans I met with so real, but they broke down. The white man will theory to me, the white man wolf yet. What's that like? You're not full blooded. Not african. Normal. Are you white man's will. You'd like to appear. Oh, that's you. That you would be the white man's wolf. That's why on the low the community black people saying, no, we're not african americans because they consider themselves african americans. Yeah. I had a buddy of mine. I went to africa to another black guy was telling me the same thing. He's like, dude, he goes, don't don't ever call yourself an african american. He goes, because you go over there. He goeS, they don't like it. He goes, they don't like you.

Speaker 2:          00:46:10       They don't want to see you. And they're jealous and they get angry at you and they want to fuck you up. And I go, really? He goes, don't ever think you're going back to africa? No, but it's weird because you see people holding up the fist and all this other stuff, but we're so far removed. I can send us a group of people that, you know, the things have happened in our past. So we're afraid of that, but we don't know how future looks either. Well, it seems cool to have this idea that there's africa and it's like, like fucking narnia or like it's like a, it's like the, the blue people that lived in, um, the fucking avatar avatar. What was that planet? The planet they lived on. That's what about the name of those trees with beautiful matt? It's like I read it reminded me of other tanium. Pandora. Pandora. Dora. Yeah. Pandora or I'm pandora and dora. Yeah, that's hilarious. Um, but I remember like the way people would think of a native american life, like a, it's really similar. Yeah, I think they'd had this idealic existence. It was beautiful. They lived in harmony with nature. They only killed what they needed. And there's no war. Like I've had a bizarre conversation with hippies about north America,

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       but native americans, and not that I'm anti native american, I'm by far the opposite. I think it is insanely cool that this place was populated just a few hundred years ago by people that were essentially living the way people live tens of thousands of years ago. And they were successful at it. They were, they didn't even horses, man. They didn't have horses until european settlers. There's a lot of people don't realize what's even more fucking weird about that is that horses actually evolved in north America. Horses started in north America and made their way to africa on land masses and became zebras the course of millions of years. This is a, one of the weirdest things about plains indians and horses is that they didn't really have them, but they, there's some belief. this is all from this guy dan flores, who's a, um, I guess you would call it an environmental historian.

Speaker 4:          00:48:27       I think that's what he's called. Um, but I'm reading one of his books on coyotes. But when he was talking about north America that they almost, they had like, almost like a myth about, uh, about horses. Like it's possible that at one point in time they had domesticated horses somewhere in north America, killed tens of thousands of years ago. But this is all like pre ice age, ice age, hits, ice age thaws out like a lot. A lot of shit has gone down here. But those people, they did not live in avatar. Existence Is my point. Like native americans, we would go to war with each other. They fucking kill each other. They do horrible things. The ones in the great lakes area, they did a lot of cannibalism. Yep. The nez perce, I think they, the name of the indian they were talking about, they were like, kill their enemies and shIt.

Speaker 4:          00:49:16       They would find trappers and kill them and eat them. You know, like it was not this beautiful world, but dave's doing the same thing. But I thinK it's just a matter of resources. Right. That's how I look at a light or. Yeah, that's also the same reason why racism exists. It's like people get in this us versus them thing. We want these people, whoever these people are, they want, you know what? Everybody has to be on this team and fuck everybody else because that's the only way they feel like they can survive. That's the oLd way, you know, but what's interesting to me, I think is that in this day and age, thAt old way is just melting in front of our eyes because people understand each other. I mean white people, that black lives movement hashtagged on their fucking twitter page. A fuck load man. How many people today are racist and compare it to a hundred years ago it was probably radically lower.

Speaker 4:          00:50:08       Is lower. It's amazing. Like how white women want to fuck black dudes because of this thing. Sure. So in a way, it's not all for nothing. You know what it's like to. It's like your first liner, your first responder, like the nine slash 11 firemen. They got mad pussy after nine slash 11. Those guys were superstars. Girls would just fuck firemen for real, especially if a girl worked in a building that was close to where the towers went down. Like those guys were goddamn heroes there. All their hero genes fired up. That's it. I wonder if that's what makes men want to do it in the first place. They know that women are going to think through heroes. Fuck them.

Speaker 1:          00:50:42       I think so. I think guys like want to be the alpha, you know, in a certain. I found my plAce to be an alpha, you know what I mean? So if I was a black guy, I would probably play up racism big time just for white pussy. However you could play it up its chicks that, that told me yet now you just want to make out with black dude, they feel nothing they could do. so they just want to make out what black this guy and they could do. They feel they feel so whatever about what's happening. Oh they want to just make out, just to make, make it. Could you somehow. And I was like, you know, well, there's a few videos that have come out this year to just every where everybody's got to go. Okay,

Speaker 4:          00:51:22       we'll now give me an excuse now explain it now. There's a few that are like the one that the guy got shot in his car, reaching for his wallet with his wife and kid in the car with you telling me these things don't exist. Because everybody was like, ah, that's how they said it went down. But you know, the guy probably said something or he went and reached for something or maybe he had a record. Maybe they knew this guy was a dangerous. Nope. Nope, nope, nope, nope. Just to dude complying, reaching for his wallet and gets unloaded on by some fucking psycho, some stressed out ptsd. Who knows what the fuck is going on in that guy's head. Who knows? You know, one of The things I thought was interesting, they had this video online recently that I saw it was, um, they took this guy who was an active, um, he was a big time detractor of the police who's talking about how horrible the police are.

Speaker 4:          00:52:21       And they invited him to go through like one of their police training safety courses. And what they do is they, you're supposed to determine when to shoot or when you, when you can get shot, when, when someone can be a threat, when you have to shoot them. It was fucking amazing. It's amazing to watch because this guy in just a few of these scenarios started freaking out. like he got shot in a couple of them. When they shoot you, they shoot at the ground in front of you with a blank. Like, like. So you had to realize that this is how quick a cop can get shot by a psycho. And so there's different times where he got pulled over, he pulled someone over or where he was handling this one guy in a parking lot and the guy went behind the car real quick and they came out and shot him like within a second, you know, it was like, sir, can I see some identification, sir? Yeah man. Hey man, I'm just working, dude. I'm skipping my stuff here. And he goes in the back and pulls out a gun and shoots him. He's like, this happened. This is an actual scenario. Yeah. This has happened and it's probably happened 100 times. A bunch of times. Yeah. So they have to. They're always fucking like this man. They're always arguing.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       And you know how people are. Some people like, oh my god, we're almost out of gas. Oh my god, we're almost, we're almost doing this. What are we going to do? What we do there? And you're like, will you shut the fuck up if we get out of gas, will walk to a goddamn gas dash station. It'll take us 20 minutes. We'll get some gas will come back. Don't cry. Jesus christ. Yeah, I know somebody to talk to a cop and they said that when they started working and then 11 years later. Oh yeah. Going into those areas where these things always happen and after years and yeah, it just, it just wears on you for sure. And I know from the air just me growing up in situations, you know what I mean? I wouldn't want to go back. I barely go back there, you know, so.

Speaker 1:          00:54:08       But they do give you nerves. Your nerves heightened, it naturally kicks in 100 percent, you know, and like, yeah. And soMe people can't handle those nerves. You learned how To breathe quietly. You don't know, like somebody, you could walk down the street and somebody could pull a pistol out on those things though. I've been driving down the street with my ex lady and she was talking and I was like, get down because I saw a guy draw on a corner and shoot across the street at another guy that's the gun went up. We drove under the, the, the, the fire. Right. But it was long. It was long. Oh my god. And then they went up, we went under, oh, we got the second shot off and I drove and I was like, man, that was crazy. Like I'm that guy, like lady, like get up, we made that was crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:54:54       And she's like, you didn't call the police. And I'm like, for what is he like to tell what happened? And I was like, I don't want to be. And that's how crazy it is, the way you don't even want to be involved because you've got to go to the cops. And I ended up calling the police and I'm just like, he described a victim. I was like, white t shirt, blue jeans, that's all I said. And that he was like, was he black? And that was just a long pause. It was a long poles like sarah is he black. And I was like, man, you know, that nick was black man.

Speaker 1:          00:55:33       It felt weird. But yeah, because I realized, yeah, like it's just weird things that happened. But uh, it's interesting with goes on because I met guys who shot at people before and shot people. So if you hear anything About my set, you know, I know both sides, you know what I mean? So it's just interesting attitude, you know, the chop people, how many of them got caught? One. Oh my god, one because he ended up shooting my best friend's sister and her baby in a passion crime. Oh jesus. And his last words to me was, he was weird. I was leaving the house one night, we was in the projectS, you know, he played, you know, play cards and shit, like I don't really want in thAt like that. Um, but I remember

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       and he was on the steps and he looked, he looked up at me and he's like a mad. He was like, you're smart, you got a chance to get out of here. And it was one of those weird moments, You know, uh, and he was like, man, just keep doing you. No matter how weird or whatever, people say, y'all just keep doing you type. He's like, I love you. And I use love like that. So I was just like, all right, you know, and then I left. And then that was my last tIme seeing him. You know, how long after that did they do the crime? Probably like a week or two because I was out of town and I got back and they were just. Yeah, there's war zones. That's what more zone. I mean, when you're in an area that has a lot of shootings, so much so that you drive under a car.

Speaker 2:          00:57:11       You don't even want to call the cops, you know, if you saw something like that in beverly hills, if you were an average person who's like a successful accountant, he was a nice home in beverly hills and you're driving to your house and someone shoots over your car, fucking for sure you're calling the police, right? Because it's rare. Doesn't happen. They're very often. That is if you think, how many people died during war time? Every year. Um, how many find this out, jamie? How many? Uh, I wonder if this is possible to know. I was going to say, how many shootings occur in Iraq and Afghanistan? How many military involved exchanges of firearms? And then compare it to how many people get killed in America every day from gunfire and you know, everybody's like, well, this is just a gun, a gun, right? Tissue. No, just not just looking at what's happening, like looking at where they're like super dangerous spots and the, and the in the mindset and the lack of the so called lack of resources people think they have.

Speaker 2:          00:58:14       Yeah. Um, I all. When you say lack of resources, you mean no hope for the future. Oh, it just fear based. So I got to eat. You know what I mean? Like the power company don't care that, you know, you all love each other and you're trying to go to better your life. Exactly. And Sometimes your lady, your girl don't even want to heAr that either. I think that is a big part of what keeps these communities exactly the same way. You know, there's a dude named eddie wong, he's a chef and an author and he's done a bunch of cool shit and he's funny dudes. Got a show on vice and he brought up this idea of universal basic income and he's like, you know, just giving people enough money every year so they live, you know, like you don't have to worry about your bills, you don't have to. Everything's paid for. yeah. Everything after that you have to work for. And I remember thinking time is fucking ridiculous. You can't get. People think people are going to get fucking lazy. They're just not, that is not, that's not gonna work. But now the more I think about it, the more I think of that might be like the best way to curb crime, the curb need to curb people doing things at a total desperation to,

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       uh, to curb A certain amount of despair that some people feel. And then from there it might be like a jumpstart for people pursuing other ideas that might successfully contribute to the economy. and I'm, I don't know enough about the economy to really comment is I'm just reading a bunch of different things a bunch of people have said about it. And I'm like, well, so it might actually make sense in terms of law enforcement, in terms of unemployment, like all sorts of different things you would have to factor in like where the money would come from. and I was like, wow, it's kind of counterintuitive. But once you look into what you like, look if how many of these people that are super desperate and don't have money for bills, there's no jobs. How many of those people would relax a lot if they got x amount of dollars a year, whatever it is, they would survive.

Speaker 1:          01:00:11       I know like with myself, I'm like, I'm around people that make money now and they like, money's not important, but I'm like, you made it to the mountaintop already. You know what I mean? You made a certain income, but when you're surviving you don't have time to feel things. You don't have time to be philosophical, to fail. Yeah. I feel like I'm sad. You know what I mean? Like, or these things. Like I even look at my mom definitely now because she had at one point lost her children and she had to get them back and she raised us in survival mode so she never thought or reading a self help book or learn how to money manage all those things, you know what I mean? And me and my sister had a place now where we could do those things, you know, we can talk about, you know, how we feel or even look back and see where we went wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:01:00       And tHat's just a luxury that, you know, I see what you're saying. My mother, who was a father, a mother, a woman who becomes a guy and take though roles on it, does something to her emotionally, you know what I mean? Uh, you know, so, um, when the kids is gone now she might have a chance to grow and see what things went wrong. If she doesn't feel it's too late. Yeah. But in survival mode, I try to tell people that who tried to talk about these issues but never have been in this situation before and feel the need to go out and see why people get out and don't look back or they try to help people and people concentrating on other things. The reason why. Yeah. That. Yeah, the survIval mode is very primal. You know, the law, the law don't matter and survival model or a. Yeah, you can take things. You could run up in this door and take things because you just that hungry. You know what I mean? So yeah. I've seen and been a part of all these things. You like clothes, you want luxury stuff to the point that you would take it, you know, go to the mall and take a polo shirt. Yeah. You know what I mean? You know, so yeah. Yeah. Survival mode is a place that most have no idea,

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       right? Most people would just guessing me included, just guessing.

Speaker 1:          01:02:23       Well, as people that is in a situation even worse than mine and I'm. Yeah. You see what it, it, it does the people. And after a while they kind of like it. They might make six figures, but they still go to the projects because it's exciting. It's exciting. One and two. They can't communicate with people who've been making 100,000 they whole life. I grew up in that situation.

Speaker 4:          01:02:47       Well, you know, that's a big thing with people that go to war. People that have been to war, they for some reason, even though it was awful and saw friends die. It was the best time of their life. Yeah. It's like there's something about living knowing that any moment you could be dead that makes the live moments, the moments where you're not that more special and then you come back here and everything's sort of muted. Yeah. Just tone down. You know? I think that's why a lot of rich people, they start, if they don't have any meaning in their life, they don't have a thing that they're really into. They just start buying shit. They just start collecting houses and boats and they're just trying to figure out there's got to be something exciting to do here. There's got to be something.

Speaker 1:          01:03:29       Yeah. You know. Well, once I started making like $30,000 a year doing a standup, it changed me because I came, I wasn't invited to la. I slept on the floor for a year. You know what I mean? I did the whole car thing and built everything up from there. He lived in out of the car. You were doing that for like a couple of weeks, you know, but everybody's got a cool story that makes it, that might make it that I know a lot of people like rhonda rousey. She had a cool living out of that was a very interesting interview. A lot of emotional, a lot of people that live in out of your car, you be to meet x. That's kinda normal for la. But I figured, I think I made it cop. Pardon me, think I made him. I graduate from college because I was a fresh graduate from college and I was like, I got to unlearn everything I was taught. now how so? Because it's institutionalized thinking to me there's no difference between the university. Yeah. There's no difference between college and prison sometimes to meet what bay way different. You can quit college. Well, yeah you can't. you can't. That's true. But you know, both get money for how many occupants they have and right. I Look at those stats and they teach. You assert it's a society within both, you know. Then even the military, because I went to Afghanistan for 13 days, I think colleges are incredibly important,

Speaker 4:          01:04:44       but I think that like all things when the world around them evolved quicker than they do, it creates issues and I think a lot of what you're seeing, I've, I've talked to some kids who go to school that are taking these classes from ridiculous left wing professors who are basically communists. You know, there, there's a lot of them. IT's not just a few and this left wing thinking is like super uber prevalent on campus to the point where it's like distorting kid's versions and views of the world and it's trickled down. It's the students is to faculty. There's a lot going on. It's ultimately a lot of it is like the people at the very top of it all. It's really kind of fascinating because those people are shaping people's minds and they're involved in a lot of ways from what comes out of that in a cultural sense, but there's a lot of backlash because that too is a lot of people that are going to those schools and now we're reading online accounts of what these professors do and how these. A lot of these professors have zero experience in the world itself. They just live in academia. They, they get the degree can go from getting a degree to teaching and they teach and they just don't enter the world, so they live in this world of these sort of esoteric ideas or these philosophies that they would like to be real but might not necessarily be real. They teach kids.

Speaker 1:          01:06:10       I was kind of fortunate in that because like I test, I took some weird tests in elementary school that sent me to these schools, a upper middle class high school and they just figure it out. You're smart. Yeah, but It alienated me from my community, my, like my. We got bused to a school, so everybody in my apartment complex got on the bus and went to school And then we got separated to where it was like five black people in this class and when we would go to lunch we have to walk on different sides of the hall and everybody in my neighborhood just coming through the whole stuff. So things started to happen then, but how could they not see that coming? That almost seems like one of those government experiments, lIke a psychological tuskegee experiment, you know what I mean in a, in a sense.

Speaker 1:          01:06:58       But what happened was by the time, like my professors were like rich millionaires because they taught the subject that they did well in. Right. You know what I mean? Uh, I would say like a comedy comedian, I mean a comedy class, except that that teacher made it right. You know what I mean? So they write books and they write their own books. They got millions, you know, they're doing this because they want to, you know, they retired already. I think my stat teacher retired at 30, you know what I mean? 30. Yeah. He wrote his own book and I didn't like that goddamn because I couldn't steal this book. You couldn't steal It went up because he wrote his own book. So he gave. We had to buy it from him and, and he download the uh, downloaded somehow. Oh, that's interesting. But sold you his aunt.

Speaker 1:          01:07:47       He had to sell his books. Every time a class he taught. Ooh, that's tricky. So I went to college my freshman year and then have books because in high school they provided books, books. So I made a, I made money to buy a book and they got booked buyback programs, but they give you 25 percent with a book's worth and I just couldn't get into that. So I had this still books and I would sell the books at 50 percent. You steal them and sell them. And what would you steal a physical copy of the book? Where would you get them from the bookstore to snag them from the bookstore? Yeah, because the thIng that the alarm they had where they alarm and it's fun because the engineering books school, but it never was hooked up properly. So. And I was standing up just to put it in my waistband and walk out.

Speaker 1:          01:08:36       This is all very alleged. Id never really happened. Never really happened. You know what I mean? This is just fiction. If I was the right cast, if I was to write a book though is how it will be done. Right. But I didn't do it like a massive. I didn't do massive because I know what grand theft is. Right. You know what I mean? So it's only a few people that I supplied and it's easy. You buy, you getting it for 50 percent and then you can have that money back at the end of the semester. Yeah. That's a good deal. Yeah. That's a pretty good deal when, when except for stealing, stealing, stealing part. But

Speaker 2:          01:09:08       I allegedly might've gotten college books that way to a lot of super common. Well Today kids can just download most things, right? Yeah, that's true. It must be really hard for them to sell their books now because kids can just go to like a bit torrent because especially if there's like a college course that's an a major university and most likely someone's gonna upload it to a torrent. Right? We assume, but we wasn't tourists. I went to school when napster drops, so we was a group. Oh shit. That's pushed all that for. I remember now. I remember the crazy argument about napster. I remember I had to sit back and go. I remember very clearly when that metallica guy got involved, lars ulrich got involved and he was saying that this is stealing and and it was going crazy and freaking out. I remember literally sitting back because I was listening to it on sirius satellite radio.

Speaker 2:          01:09:58       I Think it wasn't something I was listening to something on my car. What year was that? Like what year was napster? O two. Was there even sirius satellite radio. My imagine this might have been the radio actual radio. Xm was right around that same time. I think it might've been whoever was out here, it might have been howard stern. it was listening to something and they were talking about it and I remember thinking just stepping back and going, whoa, this is a new thing. Like people have figured out how to get stuff for free online that normally it'd be like 20 bucks or 10 bucks, where the fuck it is. And I remember thinking, whoa, this is a new door that just opened up. I remember, I remember like sitting back in my chair, I was in my car, I remember the fucking parking lot. I was going to buy dog food and I was listening to this and I remember I sat back and I went, oh man, this was a moment. Yeah, it was a real moment in our culture.

Speaker 1:          01:10:52       Well before then, look, our dorms didn't even have the internet, right? You didn't have an internet. You sTill had to go to the computer lab. So check this out, check this out. This was the hustle. We met two white guys. One guy broke his foot when he was young and his dad gave him my old computer and he started working a little car game and from there he learned programming. Right. He said we can get him access to a computer lab. He could supply our rooms with internet because they was wired, but it wasn't hooked up. Oh, so he can get the numbers and if and statements and make the thing communicate with one another. So a few of us in the dorms had internet. whoa. And this hack the door, it's like an episode of mash and this the problem with learning how to learn how to hustle and survival mode.

Speaker 1:          01:11:40       You learn how to get stuff for free, but you don't learn how to monetIze it all the time. But what we did was we, we started selling like cds and stuff like that. You know what I mean? So you download stuff and then sell, sell, sell because nobody had laptops. I'm nothing like that. Oh wow. Yeah. A friend of mine called the crazy stories. We're going to look back on this. This is like, those people were in the camera first got invented. Yeah. Yeah. We started around for four hours and he painted us. You know whaT I mean? This is literally what that's like. This is what happens man. And thanks to I think a year or two earlier, I was in the crack game a little bit. You were in the crack game a little bit. Like 600 would be a meme. I was in the crack game a little bit.

Speaker 1:          01:12:27       What this thing was new. ThiS thing was a new hustle because more people love music. Yeah. When did the crack game open up? That was 80. The eighties something. That was when everything became a. They blamed everything on crack. Yeah, it was. They literally blamed everything on crack. The epidemic. like all white people are terrified to crack. They thought that for sure. For sure. Do you want to match that brand? Now you're lookIng at it. Oh wow. So like the top off of it. Put in your drink, you'll get smArter. It um, it affected me in the nineties, mid nineties. How so? With my father and my aunt to see, see a deterioration, deterioration of people and families, like full on somebody you look up to. Just, you know, it was a, it was a way for people to get coke way easier. Right? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:13:30       That's basically what it is at the same high for it or the amount of for cheaper, you know what I mean? Five, $10, but it has a different effect. It must have some sort of a different effect because people said that the crack thing, like after you do it, it's like really good in the beginning and then it's not so good after awhile. But at the same with coke, I think you still chasing that happened. Did you ever know say yet though? Leaving the possibility. Open bowers ready to party, you know, everything I've done, I do it for experiment with it and to understand addiction and learn like comedy makes me so happy that I don't have to lean on anything for any emotional thing. So when I do it it's just to see what it's like. Right. So like when I did shrooms, you know, that was, I was there documenting the experience and then I will go back into it and then I can go out being self aware mentally.

Speaker 2:          01:14:26       Almost like from an engineering perspective, we trYing to back engineer what's going on during these drugs to try to figure it out. Let me write this stuff down. Then I'll go back and look at it and try to figure out how I got there. Well, even when I got into business, it was like, let's see what makes you so powerful. I remember having it in my hand like, let'S see what makes you so powerful. You were sayIng that to the crack itself. What did it say? oh sure. You basically,

Speaker 1:          01:14:52       when it ended, what was the low? For me, when I stopped selling the low, it was a low for me because I didn't know that the person who sells it is addicted just as much as the user because you're addicted to selling it. The power, the money. When you walk in a building and people know who you are and people you can use the control you have over people. I'm like, this will wipe

Speaker 2:          01:15:14       power. Feels like

Speaker 1:          01:15:19       that's. It was a guy who ran into a store, got some clothes and brought it back because he dIdn't have any money. That's a powerful thing, you know? Right. Yeah. People are sucking your dick, you know, stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          01:15:38       Wait a minute. How's it equate to guide getting some clothes and bring them back? What? How, what the power. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:15:45       because they don't. There's nothing they would normally do. You can make somebody do that. You know what I mean? So I look at it like if I was, and I can think like a one percent because I got a business education in business. So they give you a republican mindset. So if I was in control of over society, right? And I had a group of poor people and I control the resources and this happened on the street with drugs to this drug, they will get robbed. If I control the resources, I can allow it to go out or I can not allow to go out. I can control the price point and if you can't afford it, you know what I mean? Then it's like, okay, let's see what else you could do

Speaker 2:          01:16:24       to get this thing that you want. So you were getting addicted to the power of controlling these people, having these people dependent upon you that you would show up, you be important, you'd be making money doing something that's kind of dangerous. There's like a bunch of different things going on, but I think I did it enough to see it, but I didn't do it long enough to get out. I think probably like six months or a semester to. How'd you get out of it? I had the

Speaker 1:          01:16:47       one point I had, I got propositioned to take control over this town and it was at a point consciously why? Like I was at a private college. I lived the triple life. I had basketball scholarship, I had classes that I was failing. It was a religious college, I had white friends and then I would go to the black community and hustle at night. There's a lot of stuff to do. You know what I mean? And I'm like, at one point I was shot at, I was hanging with my white friends and they didn't know what the fuck was going on. He got shot at with your white friends because they wanted to buy weed, but guess what? They had to go get weed in this other place. You know what I mean? Uh, yeah. so, and that, that person allegedly, his uncle worked for me.

Speaker 1:          01:17:36       this is the first allegedly of all this is a legit, you know what I mean? So, uh, I remember it was a pharmaceutical company in that town that made a lot of money and I remember standing outside face to face with it and I was like, this is a setup, we will never win this. All the money Is right here in this pharmaceutical company is illegal, you know, and I met a guy who was addicted to crack and he owns a pharmaceutical company and cvs bought them out for like one point five, one point $8,000,000 and you know, all that money went, you know, um, and uh, and these and these things made me be like. And then the fact I was getting angry because I'm feeling realized how unfair life is because now mean black people who grandparents went to college, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          01:18:27       And during that time they will do like brown paper bag test to see if he was allowed to go to school within the black community. They will put a brown paper bag up to you and if you were lighter than that, you know, you could go to school and stuff. But yeah, who did this? This was like certain hbsu bsu, black universities and stuff like that. I know they would do that just to get into a fraternity, you know? Really? Yeah. You could research this stuff. A brown paper bag is so white. I know you're telling me, look at me.

Speaker 1:          01:18:59       Wow. Uh, so the anger started to come and then you In the streets hustling. And I don't think I had the mentality. It got to one part. I knew that if I crossed the line, lIke if I woulda hurt, harm somebody in a very bad way, there's no coming back from that. I don't think I was ready to make that decision. But I do know the guys, when I left, he went on to build that part of town and finished. It was just two of us at the time. But it became a a crew of six and each made 13, five a week. Take home mom. By the time they hit five, six or seven years. But by the time I linked back up wIth him, he was the only one left alive, alive or not in jail. And no religion saved them reAlly. So he pulled it out because religion, the rest of them are gone. Yeah. But I just saw the way my mind works. I just saw stuff early. You know, you just put the pieces together early. Right? Well that's, that's a skill I just killed a lot of people who have to learn. And you learn about watching either you do your own fuck ups or you watch a lot of people fuck up around you. Yeah. Like if you talked to the children

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       of alcoholics, they rarely drink. Not, I shouldn't say rarely. When I should say is I run into a lot of people who were the children of alcoholics who realize like fuck that noise. And they realized growing up with unreliable parents fucked up and this and those people like proof positive. You don't have to actually go through the mistake to learn yourself,

Speaker 1:          01:20:32       but once I learned I didn't hate drug dealers no more, but until then I did because one, not my dad I out and they, I heard he climbed the flagpole for, for fun because he didn't have no money. But before then this was the guy that raised me who, who managed to. We live in a small bedroom apartment, two bedroom apartment to him, a five bedroom house and cars and boats because he was just that smart and good and I seen it all disappeared, you know what I mean, what I call it, like Carol King falling or something like that. So I just wanted to see like the other parts of that and I will be in the crack crack house asking people's parents about their kids how to make kids feel about this and they, you know. No, no, no. YoU know, I talk about that right now. Like I'm like, so even during that time, still like gathering information and just, you know, well, what's most insidious about crack is that affects poor neighborhoods in general and black neighborhoods in particular. Like

Speaker 4:          01:21:37       that was one of the weIrder drugs because there was cracking poor white neighborhoods. Like there was an area called lowell in Massachusetts that had a big problem, I think it was crack or was it heroin? But there's a lot of it was crack neighborhoods for sure. Like I know I know poor white people that smoke crack, but it seems way more prevalent in black communities And it, I always wonder like, what is, um, what's the need that's being met when, when a, when a drug provides a certain type of sensation, like what is the need that's being met that is uniquely attracted to certain neighborhoods.

Speaker 1:          01:22:19       I don't know that I really don't know. I know it was cheap for certain. It wasn't cheap where we was doing it, that that's what made it so profitable.

Speaker 4:          01:22:25       But do you think that it's because of all these pressures that you were talking about, like you're, you're talking about this despair. He talking about how it just feels like you can't get out, you're stuck in this bad place with all this danger and violence and just the constant fucking pressure of that. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:22:42       I think so. I think I look at what my dad, the type of people they are personality wise, very friendly and then being in a bible belt where you're taught to behave a certain way but they are real like horny people and they like the fuck. It's true. You know what I mean? They do. You know what I mean? So I'm just Being confined, you know, growing up with two parents. I here, my friend be like they have to have pressures. I didn't have, I didn't have a curfew and nothing, you know, but I was just a good kid. I was still, they call me a square when I was younger I didn't partake anything but I will be out. I'd be like, it'll be like right there and I see it, but just instinctively I knew better but I see people came up a certain way with certain values.

Speaker 1:          01:23:29       Even my friends, they had to live with that for awhile. Well, I had the freedom to be like, nAh, I'm going to do this. So you had the forethought or the foresight to see where this could all be a problem and then you got proven. Correct. So You got, you got to see all these other people fuck up doing all these things. Yeah. Well I noticed like, oh my god, my grandmother and granddaddy snuff cigarette people snuff. That stuff. So weird though. My grandmas, they slam that shit for people don't even know whAt it's like. Snuff is like a powder form of tobacco. Um, almost like chewing tobacco is what the dude's dead, but you don't. It's an snuff is what the women, there's a powder form and they still put a mouth and they got a spit cup and they will always be like, oh, you know, as a kid, go grab my spit cup and you watch a lady just spitting up this beautiful aspect.

Speaker 1:          01:24:22       They get a paper towel and put it at the bottom. So don't make a noise. You remember? That was like a big deal. And the wild west, they have spittoons yeah. Remember that I saw movies. That's the capital, the capital in sacramento, and they got those spit things. I used to work with this dude. He was a stuntman unfair factor. It's name is peri perry is crazy. He used to swallow was tobacco juice. Oh, that's a good aNswer because he said he said he, he was working on the movie sets so often that um, he couldn't spit. It couldn't like carry around as cop and spit. So he started to swallow and this juice and they got used to it the most. I drank. I drank, I drank. And their tObacco tobacco. Before you drank tobacco, not drink alcohol and tobacco, because I used to do focus groups.

Speaker 1:          01:25:14       Might have Algeria and friends they put me on. So that gIve you 50, 75, 100, $200 to drink and taste it and give you opinion on it. Right? But if you [inaudible] my name is byron bowels, which can be byron powers, which could be Brian Bowers, Brian Powers. I could do full focus focus groups in one day. So you just change the name a little bit. Change name, put on a different shirt. Income for like, this is the hustles that we had to in college to me, colleges with four people learn white collar crimes and stuff. Right? So I had to do tobacco and they never would do it. Some people and I will do it and then they will be at a tobacco me like it'd be like me and the red and the white guys, they all like, yeah man, this one tastes a little more like stuck at the citrus flavor pops more than this, you know? And I'm in there

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       just lit. I'm like, oh man, they're just choosing my hanging out my mouth. I can't even spit. Right. What is the feeling of doing chewing tobacco when you don't do it? Was duty in that group? Uh, I think it's like I'm the equivalent to like, it. You just get like a weird buzz feeling. Like you just really like your eyes are red and they say it's really good to write on the nicotine is one of the best things to write on. It's like, it's like a more. It's like an alertness alert. Like if I eat chocolate, drink coffee, like my heart exploded, I just started doing this, you know what I mean? So it's like an alert version of that. But you still like happy and stuff at the same time, like as if you're on alcohol, it's like you buzzed in A way. So it's better, better than, than coffee. Uh, it's more of a, a drunk feeling in coffee, huh? To me from chewing tobacco. This is what kind of, this is just like the loose leaf stuff or stuff that you will know when you watch them do it and then you. And then you got, you don't even know how to spit and you like.

Speaker 2:          01:27:11       yeah. And I saw this one fucking dude, uh, who was doing public service announcements, who's going to colleges and high schools rather, and grammar schools. And he was missing most of his lower jaw. He got jaw cancer from doing chewing tobacco. I think he was a baseball player. He used to be this strapping handsome gentleman. And then as time went on the cancer, eight, his jaw, his things, to me, it's things to me, it's like a stronger a spearmint mint stealing. And if you don't know how to do it right, it gets all in your well. How many people actually get cancer from that stuff? I don't know, man. It seems like there's a lot of people that do that stuff, right? They don't got no electronic version now. They got. No, no, no, no. Well, I mean I apparently, according to people that smoke cigarettes, e-cigarettes just don't give you the same rush.

Speaker 2:          01:28:05       They don't believe that they don't give you thAt kick like a at the end of the day to me. But it's still smoke going inside your lungs. Yes. it's still smoke on of lungs, but it's not those e-cigarettes or vapor. it's actually a liquid tobacco. It vaporizes the liquid tobacco in some sort of particles have to be in the air, but it's a. It's attached to vapor to different experience than the coal. I mean, the hot smoke from fire that was caused that burn with hydrogen or something that you've ever raised in the air. Hydrogen turns into air. You burn it, you know, or is it turned the water? Some water, oxygen or water? Some hydrogen burning. Burning hydrogen turned the oxygen or does it turn the water? The water comes out of jamie and google five things at the time. We need to goddamn assessment. Um, but yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:28:59       Yeah, put cigarettes, man. they do give you a weird rush. I don't smoke cigarettes, but I've had hits of people cigarettes before. Just to see what it feels like. Like a tony hinchcliffe kamia pull off a cigarette the other night right before I went on stage. it gives you like a rush. It gives you, like your, your mind fires up. And he's like, dude, be careful. You can get addicted. These thIngs. I'm like, I am not getting addicted to your fucking cigarette and relax. I'm just going to take one puff of a cigarette. That's how I feel about stuff. Like certain things. When I told my mom did acid and I tell people in the south, I do ask them, hey, thank you know what happened to your father? Why would you go down the same path? They think it's the same trend. See things different.

Speaker 2:          01:29:45       I understand what he went through, but. And also I came back as moses also, so that didn't help. ExcUse me, but I came back like, we mean it came back. I met god. Oh, after you do, these are the instructions. EverythIng's, everything's gonna. Be okay. I seen life, I seen death. I time traveled. Hm? Yeah. That sounds pretty a trippy. It's like god dammit, byron, you went nutty all not around what those white people. But that adds on to the fact they already think I went and for graduating and saying I'm going to do stand up. So they were right. Then. It's like you're confirming, but they're confirming that they were right. Oh, well yeah. In a sense they already like nuts. This guy is already. He's out there. I don't know what he's doing to an asset. crazy. He's, he's telling. He's telling jokes.

Speaker 2:          01:30:37       I got introduced like, yeah, this is my nephew who graduate from college. He say he gonna go tell jokes. Like it's a joke. Yeah. I got introduced to his dad and tell him how much Kevin Hart makes. I said, tell. Tell those people how much capital. This was before kevin. It was before kevin. Tell him how much jamie foxx made. Tell him how much. I mean, fill in the blank. Go to martin lawrence, work your way up the million different fucking comedians like jet graduated from college is a less likely scenario than if you're actually funny. Making a lot of money doing standard. Yeah. You know, like I, it's now. Now you're at the point be like this is all you do. And I'm like, yeah. And they like, oh, they realize Now that you're. I was in Dominican Republic and I was like, what you do? I was like, I talked to people for a living and he was like, that's all.

Speaker 2:          01:31:23       I was like, yeah, well you gotta write some shit down. You got to fIgure out what's funny about what you're about to say. it's a little more complicated than that, but yeah, at the end of the day, that's all it is. I call it communication. That's all. Yeah. You know, at this level a level that it's interesting now because I'm in a weird space with far as stand up weird space to me how so far as to show business. So that's a show business. How so? Because there's a place in show business where art meets the business part. You know what I [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       and that's when it gets interesting. That's when the fight begins of like, you know, uh, do uh, what platforms can I, can this be allowed on or okay, you're going to put me on the show at five people. I waNt to do a show. It's just myself, you know, and those things. Or you got agents now you ask them to book you and then you don't hear from them for five months, you know. So that was the weird part of just learning that part of show business.

Speaker 4:          01:32:30       navigating the waters of sharks. Yeah. It's funny, daniel tosh and I were at the improv. NaMedrop watch me, we're at the improv the other night and there was this one dude who was a manager is kind of shifty character and daniel came over and he was like, that guy gives me the creeps and I tell him, I go, you don't know. That guy said to me once, he said to me, you're the one that got away. And he said, dude, he said the same fucking thing to me. And then tosh even tweeted it to me with a bunch of passes. At the eNd of it, it's, there's gonna be those guys. But if you find someone that's good, you know, you develop a good relationship with a good agent and a good manager. It's like everything else, man. You can come to hollywood and meet a bunch of crazy actors or you can meet a bunch of artists.

Speaker 4:          01:33:18       You know, you can meet a bunch of people that are completely out of their fucking mind full of shit. DoiNg math, doing adderall day, promising you the world never delivering shit. Or you can meet some of the people that you. And I know from the comedy store, like you're in a family, like you're part of the comedy store family. That's true. You go down there and there's so many of us. I mean, I hate to keep bringing it up, but this goddamn love fest at that place, you know, it's a very interesting. It's bEautiful, right? People's like, oh, that's weird. Energy is bad anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:33:48       Like, it's a, it's a frat and you know, and this is a thing,

Speaker 4:          01:33:53       it's a different place for sure than it's ever been before. But there's, there's no bad energy at the comedy store. That's a goddamn hug fest.

Speaker 1:          01:34:01       Well, I, I, I, I felt a little something when I first went there. That's probably what brought me to the store honestly. Um, because I started in the urban rooms and they didn't want to book me because it was too far. It was too experimental, my style. So I was like gonna try to get into comedy store. And I was like, I broke in the club before I know how tough it is or whatever. And he's like, hey, you can't go there. They don't, they don't let black comics and they racist and I was like, they racist. I was like, man, I've been dealing with racism. Like that's easy. That's a mental thing and that's what I did. What do you think the comedy store was? Racist. That's what I heard. Who said that? Like a lot of black comments were saying that when I got here, I bet they weren't that funny. Well, it's different, you know, it's a different style. First off and a racism is mental. Like, you know, to me hollywood is racist. You go in a room and be like too light, too dark, too tall, too short, too fat, but then it's sexist. It's

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       just. Then it's, it's a sizes, just like they don't like fat people. There's a lot of things at hollywood is, but it's because they're trying to fill apart. I have an idea in their head and what it's going to be and not live. You let that get to you. I had went through so much mentally they. I was like, that ain't going to stop. That's nothing. But yeah. But still they were racist. They were still in higher you like it's not the comedy store is, is they get a lot of pressure to be more this more diverse, more. I know I've seen it. I've talked to them about it. Yeah. Well they tried to do is just book the funniest people. That's what they always try to do. Just before the guy was booking it was fucking crazy, but his idea, he probably thought he was doing the right thing.

Speaker 2:          01:35:42       He did. Well, that's how I made it through that. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. You know, so everything else was easy. I sat there and listened to the talks and you let it, you can let it affect you or you can or you can be like, fuck it. Well people don't know that. That stopped like, well, like two years ago that guy stopped working there and from then on it's become a completely different environment. It's insane now. It's so much better and I'm glad I'm a part of it. Like as far as making the cut because the talent as far what people got going on, I still feel like a regular comic compared to what the people that I'm on stage with now and that says something about me I've failed confidence wise, but also letting me know like, you know, I gotta get, you know, whatever else I need to get done done. You know what I mean? Like I should be like, amongst the big book, I feel like it'd be a monster, big monster, big boy. Monks amongst.

Speaker 2:          01:36:44       I get it because after a while you do rooms and you're the funniest person in the room and that can make you cocky. But then one night somebody don't show up or somebody don't want to follow joe rogan and you have to follow joe rogan and then you learn what season is on a different level and you can't cheat your way to being seasoned in anything. You know, you gotta put your time in your timing. Yeah. Yeah. And that's one of the things that comedy store's always been very good at giving guys opportunities because of the fact that also there's a bunch of people on it at night. It might be, you know, people on an average lineup was like 13 or 14, 12, 12, 12, so 12 people doing 15 minute sets and the show goes on all day. So you're going to get some opportunities if you're a young guy or young girl to go on, like right after chris delea or right after, you know, a joey diaz or ron white, you get a chance to see these people take these tough spots after they just watched he go on after ron white, you're going on after someone.

Speaker 2:          01:37:50       These people love. They love that guy. Come to see him. They're excited when he's there. They're

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       all googly eyed. The. That was their time. There's a bunch. If ron white's at the comedy store, there's a good chance that a bunch of people in the audience came there specifically to see him. So if you go on right after him, you have to introduce them to the world of byron bowers. You know, it takes a little time, you gotta like ease them in, you've got to relax them that now you know, ron's gone. I know that he was only here for 15 minutes but he's gone and now I'm going to come up and it's, it's a very, very unique environment in that sense because it gives us a chance to also see how other people do that and then also see, I mean, you're going to get the chance to see 12 different people styles if you sit there the whole night. Yeah, that's true. So much difference in their style and so funny. So much. I mean big difference between you who's really funny and a guy like michael costa who's already really funny, our, uh, as well all really funny. But when you look at the two of you guys together, what you both have in common is that you both have like all this really cool potential and you might see that 10 times.

Speaker 1:          01:38:59       Yeah. So, you know, and it's weird because tommy told me this, he was like, look, we started you in the belly. We're going to put you in a. Later he broke the whole thing down for me. He's like, your stuff is regional, right? He's like, well, I'm gonna put you up in front of these international people at 2:00 in the morning. And I was like, what? And what happened was I started learning how to communicate with. I thought it was funny, tell jokes and then he said, by the time we put you in the main room with these guys to do theaters, you will learn how to perform it in front of a group of people between 220,000 by the time you mastered these rooms. So he to me, regardless, I listened to what people say he told to them, but he didn't have those conversations with me.

Speaker 1:          01:39:40       He just made it. It just prolonged what I thought I was ready for. But by the time I got to the main room and I'm used to doing these intimate or all tea rooms and I'm performing behind like you are louis. And I'm seeing like, oh, this is a broader audience and I got to perform. I got to walk the stage. I got to. I can't do it like I've been doing it in the or, right. I gotta I gotta up the ante and it made me grow as a comic and I tell people now like, yo, you performing the main room at midnight, you're going to be just as strong as somebody who does it at 8:00 by the time it's all over. And when you go to another club and you get an 8:00 spot, boom, you're gonna kill it. Yeah. So you run them with weights on.

Speaker 1:          01:40:23       Yeah, for sure. I just take cso for this hbo, uh, I was at just for laughs and I did that gallery show they have there and they had to do a warm up show and my wall was so strong I had to close the typing. You know, I had to close the taping because they, cause I, they had me like up at a time. You got to close the shit that y'all had to close the taping and I didn't want to close the taping. But in their mind they like, now you're strong enough to do this, you know what I mean? Um, and my first time with the montreal, I went up first doing them audition montreal comedy festival. Yeah. The first time I did the, uh, the call back that got me to montreal. I went up first and I didn't want to go first, but the set was so strong. It affected the next three comedians after me because people were just staring at him. And when you do content, like you just said,

Speaker 4:          01:41:18       but did it affect them or did they just not be that good? Well, there's a, that's a lot of what it is, right? It's like when someone sees you kill what the. One of the big things that happened to, one of the beautiful things about the comedy store, about what you're talking about going on after I was telling people that are killing is you learn how to relax. There's a lot of what happens is when a guy has to go on after someone that's really strong is that they panic and when they panic, they can't even be themselves, which is not as funny as that guy. Yeah, that's true. I used to feel that was a big thing that happened to me. I would always go after. There's a ton of guys that are going to have to. One of the ones who would always bomb afterwards, martin lawrence, he was just too good back then in two famous and too popular and you know, he would do it 45 minutes and then I would do whatever like 15 minutes after him and I always bombed, but I always.

Speaker 4:          01:42:05       That was the spot that I got and I realized like a bunch of things I would see here. My own jokes come out and knew they were not good. Like I didn't think they were good. So I realized like okay, I've got to change pretty much everything about my approach because what I'm doing is I got comfortable. I found like a little area that I could sort of a right and performing and these are, these are the jokes that I've sort of got and try to work with and I didn't try to expand enough. And when you get stuck into a situation where you have to kind of duke it out for survival, it makes you reassess. That's true. Why is all this bad? Like what's, what's going wrong? Like what am I. People don't like doing that because if you do, everybody wants to think they're a finished product. Right? That's like, no, that's the comfort zone, right? Everybody wants to stay inside their comfort zone. This is it. I'm good. I'm pretty happy with the way things are like, okay. But if you do that, like it's gonna take too long. Like if you really want to get, you want to be like a martin lawrence, like you're not going to do it by being comfortable. So it's not going to happen.

Speaker 1:          01:43:03       That's true. That's why I came up to you that night. I had a following and was like, yo, that was some heavy weights right there. You know what I mean? Off loans. Just content like. Yeah, just the content and life experiences and sandstone learning like okay, if I tell these stories about my dad, schizophrenia and stuff, they don't even have to be the funniest. They just so interesting. They hold. Wait, yeah. That if a funny guy to come up and talk about relationships, people still going to be like, man, that last year was crazy, but when I start doing that, people wouldn't just come up to me saying, you find it more. They were just like, man, that's that. I know what that's like because my aunt was paranoia, schizophrenia, and to me that's the universe saying hi, now you're onto something, but that only comes through.

Speaker 1:          01:43:51       Failed to me. Like you've improved through failure. Like the light bulb was invented through failure, you know what I mean? Not through getting it right the first time to 10,000 times, but that thing to get perfect. You know? So I think also we were thinking a big part of what you just said, that it's important as you were talking about the way it feels when you're listening to it, that it's not like your standard relationship stuff, that it's something that's in some ways more, more enticing. Right. It's an interesting subject like schizophrenia, like there's something, there's weight to it, right? Yeah. It's honest. It's honest. Like my, my black lives matter stuff is honest and is not going to get me liked by people, but it's how I feel, you know what I mean? And it's, it's, it's, it's to even, to me it's a little messed up how I feel about the situation, but it's honest at the moment how I feel about this.

Speaker 1:          01:44:47       How do you feel about it? We'll talk about it. Well I can, but to me, not that it's the worst part of me about the video is that he got shot in front of a toyota camry and I'm like, that's how shallow I am. If it was me, I would've found a bands or something to crawl near just because I know it's gonna look good because I'm about to go viral, right? And I want to look good before I get turned into a hashtag because that's what the police are doing is turning niggers in the hashtags. And I turned to somebody look white. I was like, you know, the average lifespan for a young black man, 25, but hashtags live forever. So it's the thing about fear, death and shallowness. And like, that's the complexity of my bits, but I have to admit, and that's a true how I really felt, you know, when even when he hit the car and I was like, oh, that the car was bouncing.

Speaker 1:          01:45:34       I was like, look at the suspension on that. But that's what makes it funny. The people, you know what I mean, that's what makes it fun of the people. But I have to learn to, you know, as artists we learned and you do this, you learn to let go of those things. But the more work I don't get, the more honest I would come because you don't, you stop trying to fit in and you don't care if they're trying to book a nice black guy no more. You get paid, you take another jacket off, you take another shirt off to you just dealt with no shirt on. Like, look, I'm in my thirties. I got wrinkles right here now. But I never got laid more in my life. You know, like he's just honest, like, uh, and it's something relieving. It's something whatever from a kid who was quiet growing up and held everything in such a release into being able to put this stuff out. Yeah. That's probably something a lot of people don't understand. Right? A lot of people don't understand that like that. Where you're coming from is not just where you are now, but it's where you started out. Yeah. And you, you, you're taking particular joy in your freedom. It's particularly unusual the way you're expressing yourself. Yeah, and it's. And as, as being volunteers, that vulnerability that people talk about, but

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       as you grow, as I grow as a person, my comedy has grown. Yeah. That's got to happen. It doesn't, it doesn't have. I read something in the day on jen kirkman and there was talking about. She was talking about the comedy is one of those things you actually do get better at when you get older and it's one of those things, a rare thing for women to, that they're still at like a 40 year old woman, doesn't have a lot of opportunity as an actress, you know, kind of play some mom rolls and stuff like that. But as far as like to lead something but a 40 year old comic, like a lot of them are just kinda getting started. True. Look at sarah silverman. She's better now than ever. She's like, what is she like 46 or something like that. Like everything like attractive and sexy with a woman.

Speaker 2:          01:47:34       Like it just, it just grows on, its not, it's not the way you look, the way you carry yourself and the way you move when you talk to. You're trying to say your fan out the bat signal before. But I look at it like I'm talking about like all women now. You know, you told her that before. Yeah. I told him this was attractive looking woman. You know what I mean? Like I've been in the green room with her. Respected the boundaries, you know what I mean? Not stare there. I see little bits but she's very nice person too. She's nice outside and it don't get all like yeah no shit. But for sure she's real friendly too. She's a. And by the way, I'm talking about all women with that ladies, like if you have self esteem problems like we all do and don't think, oh, because your hair doesn't look a certain way.

Speaker 2:          01:48:19       It's all there, but it, it kind of comes when you stopped giving a fuck, you know, mean sexiness in some ways. Yeah. Because people that are like super nervous about everything, every aspect about them to get a draining exhausting because you know that there's a lot going on. There was too much chaos, doesn't allow you to be comfortable when someone's comfortable in their own skin and they don't give a fuck. Like it's like, ah, I kind of like being around you. He relaxed me. He will let me know that it's okay to not give a fuck. That's what the benefit of the true. Not give a fuck people through not give a fuck. People make you appreciate things better. Women say I look sexy now. And I was like, what? Who are they? Why are they learning? I don't know why they line is something that some energy they feel and I don't believe him because I'm still that kid with the look.

Speaker 2:          01:49:07       You're a talented guy. That's what it is. What they. My mom still that kid with the scar on his face. Yeah. And the crooked teeth, you know? Well you're, you're handsome black gentlemen and you're funny. Smell good though. Just smile. That's what I hear. But you know, I mean talent is a big thing too, right? You see a lot of talented people in all, all sorts of different businesses. Even even like businessmen, like a businessman as well, that she just after him for his money, maybe you know, maybe that guy has that really beautiful wife because they're just after him for his money or maybe they're attracted to his talent for being successful. Like there's a little bit of that too. It's not just the money. Yeah. Like I don't think women would be as attracted to a guy who just won the lottery and got $500, million dollars as they would to some guy who's some media mogul who started his own business, built it up into an empire and now has $500,000,000. That's true. Those guys are different. Like they have that wizard air about them. Like this guy, you know, like a certain type of like elan musk how much pussy elan musk must have to beat away from him. How many girls are just

Speaker 2:          01:50:25       bombing on him? Just constantly because he's a super genius. Multibillionaire was several successful businesses. He invented fucking pay pal. He's built his own cars that run on electricity. He's making a fucking rocket ship to go to the moon is making a hyperloop that's going to go to san francisco in 30 seconds or whatever the fuck and I'll still questioning it. I looked at his stock today. I still question. She's not a part of me like this is going to be like the naked general electric. That's what I'm telling people in my mind. The thing that thing he's going to do with energy, you know, he's doing that with everything. He's a super winter. There's, there's certain guys that are just super winters and he seems to come without any of the baggage the most super winters come with. You know, there's a lot of baggage that most, most of these like crazy entrepreneur type characters are also genius has come with.

Speaker 2:          01:51:20       He doesn't seem to. He's like remarkably stable for someone who's that fucking smart and successful. He's like a god damn alien. That guy. It was weird because I had tickets talk about the silicone valley guys and made money now. And it's like, it's like they said, yeah, they nurse, but now they got money and power. So they act like that when you see them out. They 10 women, you know what I mean? Kissing all on the neck and acting like the guys we used to beat them up the job, you know what I mean? They get bullied. But if you look at the warren buffetts and the, the uh, bill gates and the guys was just like, yeah, this is my lady right here. Spent all my time working on algorithms, but it's a new day now. You know, warren buffet still lives in the same fucking house in omaha.

Speaker 2:          01:52:01       Yeah. Me and hannah was a in that neighborhood. Did you see his house? Nope, but we airbnb the property and they stared at us. When you airbnb property in that community and you have to have a cookout at 5:00 in the morning, you don't get some stairs and the next day he had a cookout at 5:00 in the morning show after party. And then was it like when you making a lot of noise or something? I don't think so. Just the average is that, you know, people make after they leave the club. That's pretty loud, you know, stumbling around 5:00 in the morning. Shit. Would it be annoying as fuck if you live next door to that house and you know, try and get some sleep? I think so. Probably. Yeah. The house across the street had three volvos in the driveway. I was like, oh, that's a lot of safety.

Speaker 2:          01:52:48       Yeah. That's a lot of white people. That's too much. It must be furious at you for waking up, so I don't know. We woke him up, but the grill was outside and so they can smell it. Yeah, and they had chilean sea bass and we came with an appetite, you know, but don't you think that that was probably pretty loud. Like how loud were you guys? I don't think it was that lab. I fell asleep. Oh, but it was. We did turn people away though. You know, how many people were there? I don't think it probably be like five or seven, but more came, but that's chaos. Five or seven. Seven people that are awake at 5:00 in the morning. Those people were probably lit up loud as fuck. Barbecuing doesn't bother you. I slept well. I didn't bother me, but at the same time I don't.

Speaker 2:          01:53:31       If I look at it from my neighborhood and my neighborhoods I lived in and they bring that bouncy castle over and they play the myriad. I see the 5:00 in the morning, which happens. Doesn't be like, oh, okay. I get it. I get it. I don't hate on him though. Right. But that's, that's the neighborhood that you chose to live in. Yeah, right. That's what they do. Like you're saying, you live in a mexican neighborhood here. Actually people asked for fucking parties. They got roosters in my niche kind of deal that get up at 5:00 AM. Three am in the morning. Dude, my gardener had the son of one of my dogs, my gardeners friend of mine and he's cool as fuck. Doesn't speak very much english, but he's. He's cool as fuck. He's got like 100 fucking roosters. 100 of them in his yard. His yard is like a chicken fighting ring.

Speaker 2:          01:54:19       Chicken fighting is different man. It's funny, like you tell people that you know somebody that fights dogs and they look at you like what a monster of a person. Because dogs are really complex and they love you. They have give you unconditional love and for you to violate that and making them fight each other is fucked up. I get it. I agree with it. One hundred percent. I'm not saying that, but you tell people that, you know, somebody fights chickens and they go like, they don't even get grossed out. I mean there's some super vegans probably get really pissed off or animal rights activist, but the average person doesn't give a fuck about a chicken and if those chickens are fucking each other up with spurs on, they put like razor blades on their back feet and they cut each other up. I noticed that I saw a tape before vic went down, have a recruitment training tape and that was my first time seeing the animals electrocuted and how they breed them and stuff like that. This was a real tight good that was going around the hood because people was fighting these animals and I know people that executed dog that I'm closely friends with. You know what I mean? And it's very, you know, interesting situation. But once again, you're talking about people who was like, oh, we was treated worse than that. You know, it's still that innately that's in you. But it's shocking when people come out against dogs like that and

Speaker 1:          01:55:43       that's why you have certain communities like, oh, what will we get shot by the cops or you know, and all this other stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:55:50       Well there's certain communities were dog fighting is super normal to. That's what I'm saying. Like is this normal? It wasn't a but I don't mean normal in that it's like less offensive than how the adult human beings are treated in that neighborhood. I mean, it's a part of the culture. Yeah, that's what I mean. Yeah. In the south, right? Yeah. Yeah. I know dude who had like 30 dogs used to keep 30 dogs in his yard. He's a professional pool player. He had a big ass yard down in, I think it was Kentucky and he, he, he was part of what he gambled on. He had dogs that they train and they would fight them, you know, and the person that I am right now looks at that and goes, well that, that's a fucking terrible thing to do. Like why would you do that? Like that? That should be absolutely illegal. But him, whatever his life was like him growing up in wherever he grew up, that was a normal thing. So I, I absolutely judge them. I absolutely judge anybody there

Speaker 1:          01:56:51       does that. But it is. We don't understand. Yeah, it's weird. Like, and to me, I think understanding comes from me personally. Like if we could really assess ourselves and look at our demons and accept all dana's right, how bad that we could possibly do some real fucked up things. Then it will make us judges other less and then the conversation can be had they try to understand. But yeah, it's certain things that you see that you accept depending on where you are are, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          01:57:24       More than a lot of ways than what you're saying is like those, those principles of life and those things that you're talking about, these different patterns that you see in electronics where the universe, you kind of see that in life. You see that in comedy to exactly what you were talking about in comedy. Like having gone through things, making mistakes, making things like really obvious and then realizing, whoa, I got to look at this for what it really is versus people who look at things through a distorted perception like most of the people that you know that have distorted perceptions of their own abilities or distorted perceptions of their own life or where they fit in in the world. Those are the people that don't progress because they're not looking at themselves. They're not. They're not taking these assessments of themselves accurately so they're not moving forward. They stay where they're at because they think that where they're at with whatever they're trying to do is good enough or it's perfect or it's better than it really is.

Speaker 1:          01:58:21       That's true, but yeah. What I learned from my last, my acid trip that the one you saw me today after that, yeah, the in art and in our genes because I saw idea or conception with. I told you it moves everything for

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       my art, moves everything forward and the jane, like you have a child or you have an idea that moves the culture or the human species and everything continues to evolve and move forward. Without those things we would. We continue to make the same mistakes over there, stuck with certain things, you know? Yeah. We're fueled by these things that we create, whether their innovation or whether they're a piece of art, a movie, you know, we were fueled buddies things and sometimes in a negative way. I mean, how many people have you met that act like a movie? Like they think they say things like they're in a movie. Oh yeah. A bunch of people. I know a dude who got in a fight with another dude and as they were scrapping, like as we're about to fight, he goes, tonight, we dine in hell.

Speaker 2:          01:59:34       He yelled that at him and the dude told me, I'm like, are you fucking serious? He's like, yeah, it really, really said that to me. That's a layer. And the guy was like, why did you fucking say tonight we dine in hell. And so they get in a fight. And the other guy, the guy who didn't say that turned out to be a really good wrestler. So the whole thing was a disaster for the other guy. Well the guy did the guy who said that dying in hell that night. Well not. I mean it's just he thought he was in a fucking movie or something. I mean he was drunk too. There's a lot going on. Right? But it's just that movies create these scenarios in people's minds that they almost want to reinvent in the real world. If a similar situation presents itself, you know, you really think you could say something fucking stupid.

Speaker 2:          02:00:19       I mean, I was, I said some things before that sounds. You know what I mean? And especially in the throes of passion, in the throes of passion. But by even poetic, you know what I mean? That should be. That should be the title of your first netflix special, the throes of passion. But byron bowers and you just sitting there with your legs crossed with like some nice slippers on in front of a fire. That's what I call it now. Reading a book. That's what I called it. Now I won't even say fucking no more. I call it because I feel I'd do something a little more creative, a little more different. I don't call it create just a lot more involved. It's a little more. There's a little more passionate about. So you're trying to separate yourself, like your branding, your style. Fucking oh, I wouldn't do that.

Speaker 2:          02:01:03       That'll be interesting. That's a lot of fucking right there. Well you think about how many different kinds of music there is. There's only one pint of vodka and you know like it. Music is a style of expressing what's going on inside your mind, your imagination, sodas. So was fucking a lot of ways we should have like different classifications for fucking men. We kind of did. We have basic bitch fucking, which is like missionary little kisses. Fucking grill. Fucking. Yeah. That's very important. You need to couch, you've got stuff in the corner of the couch. That's what gorilla fucking is about. You gotta grab a hold of things, going to be all subtraction. You might want to keep your shoes on. You got some traction.

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       I got this nike rope, a leather and not weird and I put it out on these young lady and I put it around her neck like a, like a puppy, like elise. And she was like, what are you doing? And I was like, it's the exact right thing to ask. And I was like a normal. I was like, I'll show you, I'll show you. Get up and try to move when she got to try to move like that. But yeah, she liked it and it turned on. And then to the fact that she wanted her around her neck and I put it around her neck and the more, you know, poor white girl, right. I don't want to say, but it's gotta be, you know what I mean? Yeah. A jewish probably, you know what I mean? So I'm super liberal. Jews and blacks now.

Speaker 1:          02:02:29       So as I'm pulling it, she got more turned on, but then she died because he started licking my thing and I got because I'm a skinny dude, somebody my was shaking like this and in my mind I was like, this ain't me, you know, I just let the rope go. Follow your instincts, your instincts with the knock killer. That's good. She wasn't gonna die and I don't think I'm strong. I think you could definitely kill someone with a belt around her neck. That was a length of rope, but it's kind of like the same thing, isn't it? Well, the rope belt, what kind of leather? Very good. Very good leather, you know? Very little. But it seems like you definitely kill somebody with a rope. It hurt. It would hurt if you, if you hit them with the leather, you know, but then you can kill them if you can like pull hard enough. You could kill somebody with any kind of like thin wire. I think I could probably kill someone with a boot lace. That's probably true. That's probably a true. Be careful about that. If I got a good grip on it, you know to to. It's not hard. The, the human nac is real vulnerable. No. The weird part about that is having a condom on, you know, like what part of this is safe. Like that's hilarious. She's got ligature marks or nac but std or she didn't get aids but she still did.

Speaker 1:          02:03:57       Yeah. Rough sex is fucking strange, man. You gotta be real careful with that because if you do weird shit and beat each other up and the girl goes to the cops, you're fucked. Yeah. Especially if they're not the same race and that's when black people will be like I told you, I told you I was reading about this thing in toronto. There was just this judge in toronto, that sentence, this man, he was convicted of rape and he had consensual sex in his opinion with this woman and this woman had sent them these text messages saying, you know, come on over, let's have some savage sex and this and that.

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       And then afterwards, and he broke up with her. She decided or after they had a bunch of these experiences. I forget how it works, either way, she lied to the judge and to the court about sending those texts and then because she had deleted them, but then they somehow or another recovered them and they found that she lied about that and she lied about a few other things too, but the judge started quoting all this feminist theory and quoting different feminist writers and a wound up getting this guy convicted, which is beyond a reasonable doubt. Like as soon as someone says, I did not send him a text asking him for sex and then you find out they did in fact send a text asking them for sex and it deleted. Well then you've got reasonable doubt like instantaneously you have doubt because you have to go, okay, what about the rest of this stuff you're telling me isn't true?

Speaker 2:          02:05:28       Now I'm not saying that he didn't force her to give him a blow job or that he did. I don't know. I wasn't there. He doesn't. The judge doesn't know either, but in my opinion, you instantaneously have to have reasonable doubt when you find out that someone's willing to lie about certain aspects of what happened. Yeah. So, uh, I was, I was watching this and I was listening to this, uh, this woman, uh, from what does that, what's that conservative website, the blaze or something like that. Is that what it is that Glenn Beck things and it is at the blaze. She did this breakdown of it and I was like, god, it's so, so dangerous when you get involved. Crazy people. You're sticking your dick and crazy people like you don't, you don't really know what's going to happen. Like you, you're there choking that girl with a rope and she's looking your arm like, where's this going to escalate to, you know, you can things only a volvo and these kids only place to go or she doesn't know that you've been snipped and uh, you don't tell her that, uh, you, you can't get pregnant.

Speaker 2:          02:06:36       So you keep pumping loads of nowhere and you've got to keep ramping up the sex. And so now she's wearing a helmet. And you're fucking driving it through a wall. Oh, that'll be interesting to doing that to make her happy. But you really don't like it at all. Both of you are confused. She thinks it makes you happy, but you think it makes her happy and you're just giving her cte and throwing her head through wallboard. I mean, someone has for sure putting a helmet on and some on fuck them from behind and slammed her head through a wall. That's 100 percent right. That's definitely happened. I think so. What are you looking up, jamie? I was looking at this case, but I stumbled across something I haven't seen before. Did you know canadian lawyers have to wear an outfit like this? Thank god. So you know the ridiculous. I looked up canadian lawyers and they're all good. The lord. All the lawyers have to dress like that. That's hilarious. Oh my goodness. Look at this fucking outfit they have on. They might as well be working at like one of those, a reenactment restaurants, medieval times.

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       That's why none of them are smart. They got wigs too. They are barrister. Wow. Male barristers make more than doubled their female. Um, what does it say there? It's dot, dot, dot. What does it say? Do the female had to wait weeks to just wrong crushing question. Bullshit. Oh, their female colleagues. Male barristers with their ridiculous wigs that his. God damn hilarious. Wow. That's, that's an Australia though that you just pulled up still. There's parts of the world makes you wonder, like what would happen if the United States had been formed? There's parts of the world that are still wearing wigs when they're doing their law stuff. She's hot as fuck outfits. Portrait of a woman in canadian law. She don't have to wear a wig, but the outfit looks better on her. You want her to visit you in jail? No. She tells you. I'm sorry I didn't mean to convict you and I'm going to work to get you out.

Speaker 2:          02:08:41       And she don't have no oatmeal's. He better not come with a different outfit in jail. You have to bring an oatmeal. Yes. Let me see the light. She carries them. Quaker state. What's it called? Wait. Quaker state is. Oh yeah. Yeah. There's some. That's a funny one, right? Like what the fuck does pilgrims have to do with oats? Did they grow the oats? Is that what the deal is? Because he's a quaker. It's not a pilgrim, right? Quaker oats, that's like a. That's like saying I'm going to buy mormon granola. Right. You imagine how many people would buy scientology flakes. Oh, that'll be dope. Right? I mean, that's exactly what it is. Are clear. How about catholic? Crisp. That's my morning cereal. I enjoy catholic. Chris. Everybody got the same bowl? How can. What does quaker oats. It's religious cereal. What? What it. What the fuck does a quaker?

Speaker 2:          02:09:33       I have to do anything. They didn't give a fuck about quakers. Quakers were so innocuous that they were willing to use them as props was like the way they sell klondike bars with polar bears. They use the quaker. It just says that was the first. That was the right it. The layers. Don't you think that's what they did? That do make sense. Totally. I bet quakers had fucking zero interest in quaker oats. I bet they don't get paid. I bet they get fucked over on the commissions. I bet the quaker oats company keeps all the money. Pepsi owns it now. There you go. Those quakers are out there going, what the fuck? This is ours. This is our outfit. But you look at that outfit and you go that some wholesome oats. I bet that oats doesn't even swear he doesn't drink. That oats makes its own butter. That oats lives and the either niceness falchuk way in a field and they plow with the fucking like a regular mechanical plow and they do everything old school. Right? My grandmother was

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       telling about the cotton gin class time I went to see. She liked it. She on her way out. You telling me about this? We were in the back of the comedy store. Yeah. It was interesting. And then so she wasn't alive when the cotton gin was korean mother, her mother. These are the stories she heard. My grandmother was alive. I was like, what drugs did y'all do when you were young? And she said, aspirin just came out, jesus. So that's what. That was the. That was the thing. You know what? I mean, we mean people took aspirin for recreation or she was just like, that was just the, that was just the thing outside of like, you know, home grown because they was farmers. My grandmother was like, that. Remind me of the movie, the help, the help, the help. I don't know that movie. It's like, it's about the, uh, that black lady who raised the white family type thing to help. Is that a recent movie? Really? Um, who was in it? Who was in will be goldberg, white family raised her preppy goldberg. Hilarity ensues. Emma stone was in it. Here's a picture.

Speaker 1:          02:11:36       What fucking movie is this? It helped. I have no idea what this was. My grandmother. So those two black women raised those two white women. But in a sense, in like the relationship that happened, like I went to one of my grandmother's birthday part, I think she was like 80 and it was a white family there. And I was like, who are these people? And their, my family. That's the family that's your grandmother helped used to nanny for and they remained close because of, you know, uh, she helped raise these young ladies, you know what I mean? Man, they fly, my mom, my grandmother out to philly to spend time with them and stuff like that. Uh, and it's, uh, it's an interesting, you know, situation. So, uh, just to hear these stories and you know, my grandmother telling me about when the cotton gin and she broke it down like, yeah, we'll tape the cotton and take the seeds out and let it go.

Speaker 1:          02:12:32       And people are amazed by this. They just watching it like, whoa. Like that was the thing that people looked at, like how people look at computers. Like, oh man, what are we going to do now? The napster revelation. Yeah. Like, whoa, what are we gonna do for her? This thing is here to put us out of work. And you know how people would do a day's work and got to, like she said, once slavery in it and people had to get paid how somebody, I don't know if it was a father or somebody dealing with a job and they gave him a dime, you know? Wow. So now you're not getting lodging or food or nothing like that and you got to earn a wage and you get like a dime, like doing like some heavy, you know, things. And who this is blowing my mind amongst everything else that's going on in the world, you know, you know what's crazy, that person living that life and making a dime and living in a modern semi modern to us, you know, modern in

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       its context, society is doing so much better than someone who was born 200 years before that. Yeah. And so much better than someone, you know, any anytime prior to that. So check this out. My grandmother's 90. So the women on her side. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:13:45       Family along longer. My mother, my grandmother, his mother died at 107. So between them two, you got over, you know, you got like over 200 years. That's incredible. So, uh, it's just an interesting

Speaker 4:          02:14:00       timeframe, you know, when you, when we look back at people that lived like a couple of hundred years ago, we think to ourselves like, fuck that, you know, especially if you were a slave or if like, if he would, if you were a free person living in America in 18, 10, let's just go to 18, 10, just a regular person like you. And I don't want to do that. You don't want to go back to that fucking life. Like, good lord, good luck getting fresh milk. Good luck finding vegetables. Uh, in most cities, like good luck getting everything delivered to you. They didn't even have cars yet. Ah

Speaker 1:          02:14:34       man, this is a good thing. I, since I lived, I was born in athens. My first six years in athens is a small town with uga is even athens before. So everything I ate vegetable wise was grown, you know, in that area, in the yard, in the backyard. That's amazing there. The grapes on the vine, the tomatoes came out the ground, the chickens, you know, my grandfather haul chicken. So the chicken, the a's came out of the backyard. He shot there, we fished on saturdays for cut the fish, here's off, get the skin off and they're from in the yard. He took the grapes from the vines and made wine and if he caught an abundance of fish, he will keep enough for her family and all the neighbors traded food. So my first six years is like, when you know, when you, eight or 10, they put a pellet gun in your hand, you work your way up to a hunting rifles.

Speaker 1:          02:15:29       Um, so that's what I left when I moved to the city. That's interesting. So I was a country, so vegetables and everything tasted good, you know, you get the corn off the stalk and then grandma and corn was yellow. It was like a lighter color. It was like a whitish color. She make cream corn from scratch. Um, the preserves, it was jelly was made. Uh, the rabbits squirrel, the pks fell out of the tree. You can third, you hungry. You just go outside at any time and grab food, grab two peanuts, squeezing with your hand. You got a snack, you know, and that's, that was the first, like six years, like food was there things you put them, you get a bucket, you opened them. He used to run your thumb, thumb through them, which I didn't like none of that, but that's what, that's what it was. Well there's something beautiful about that right? At this point. Yeah. At this point, because they overcharge them for that stuff now, but for

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       them it is not easy, but it looked. They made it look easy. Well, it's large scale. Everybody could do it like that. You'd have to have small populations of people with good pieces of land. Like you know, I'm sure your grandfather had to have some. My grandfather had a similar situation in New Jersey. He had a pretty good sized backyard. It was all garden. He had his area where he would drive to his driveway and then everything to the right of the driveway was all sticks in the ground and tomato plants and my grandfather grew everything and they turned their tomatoes into tomato sauce and my grandmother made homemade tomato sauce and like all of his vegetables, he would grow. Everything that he would eat all year would be like in that garden. That's a. That was a normal thing for the immigrants, you know, for people who grew, who came here from other parts of the world where you know, you had to have a supply of food, which is true.

Speaker 2:          02:17:19       I mean, it only makes sense. We figured out a way to truck things in. People have, you know, once we start tracking things in, nobody grows anything anymore. I heard a story about people like my uncle and his friend I have in money and they put $300 together and bought a goat and ate off that goat. You know? Smart. Yeah. They faded a little bit and then they ate off of it for like a month. Yeah. If you, if you kill a goat in your yard though, when people find out about it, this is my friend used to say his name, but my gardener guy that I was talking about earlier, he had, well his name's jose. It's not like you don't know. You don't know which jose it is.

Speaker 2:          02:17:56       I don't want to give away his identity. Probably jose conseco, but this, uh, he uh, he got a goat and uh, him and his, uh, his friends killed it in the yard and butchered it. And then they had a cookout and the neighbor complained apparently, and he didn't understand. He was like, what do you like? What's bothering you about this? Like, what is he didn't like? He literally didn't understand. He's like, it's safe. It's healthy. Like this is an animal. I know, I know where that the meat coming from, you know, he's trying to explain this to me in his broken english. He's like, I know where this animals meat comes from. Like why would anybody have a problem with that? If you buy meat yourself, I don't know, like he didn't understand, you know, he came from Mexico. He did just did not understand why someone would have a problem with him killing a goat and a yard.

Speaker 2:          02:18:47       Like course I killed the goat in the yard. What do you want me to kill a kid? It didn't make sense to him. They're like, you can't kill a goat in the yard. He's like, where the fuck do you kill your goat? And like, you don't kill your kid. Strange like, well what do you get your meat? You go to the store. He's like, well, you don't know where that fucking meat even came for his idea. That was alien. It's the logic is man of how things happen. I'm too weird. And you're like, yeah, if you talk to older people, you understand struggle. You know what people actually went through and on a good part, like my grandma taught me about the first dryers. Yeah. And my grandma like, no,

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       don't use it once a month. Once a month. Yeah, don't because they, you know this better. The of lennon in the sun. It still better to dry your clothes in the sun because the sun kills bacteria. Really? That's why you will. If you look at how to tie them and they say, how do you take care of denim and keeps it from fading, they'd be like it and hanging in the sun because the sun kills the bacteria that gets rid of the smell. But when I'm in jeans fade because of, because of the now you want to clean your genes because it might get smells and the like. When you break it in jeans, you really don't watch him like that. You know you were. I'm just like everyday type stuff and the dye in the denim fades and it at the cotton shrinks and all that bullshit. So hang them in the sun, you know, to keep it from shrinking.

Speaker 1:          02:20:16       That keep them from shrinking. And it was heat though. That was just the water. And then the evaporation from the extreme heat, extreme dryer, that's what makes them shrink. Right? But if you hang it in the sun, you're still. The sun still kills some of the bacteria and stuff and it makes sense. But if you ever drive, if you ever like, we don't do it here, but I did something. I had to stay in the country home and you watch like a sheet or a shirt and you hang out in the sun and with the air hit it and it just the freshness of the smell, you know, and what was smart about this place, they put the lemon trees near the hanging place. So now you're close to the city. A lemon smell to it. Right? Because the wind that comes through. That make sense? Yeah, it does actually make sense. But if you're in a city and it's polluted, that's different. That's different. Yeah. You're

Speaker 4:          02:21:09       clothes might smell funky. Like that's the weirdest thing to me is when people are around people who smoke cigarettes, how strong the smell is in there. Close. Strong. Like I never realized it until I would come home from back when you could smoke in clubs. It was a big thing. Comedy clubs, man. I mean everybody smoked. It was just constantly. We'd go to a bar, everybody smoked, you would go to comedy clubs. Everybody smoked and I remember not realizing when I smelled like and then taking a shower and then picking up my clothes and be like, what the fuck? Like they stunk. It's smells bad. That is a weird thing, man, that people have something that gives him cancer. It makes everyone around them stink. Like not even me. I wasn't even smoking, but being around those people made me stink and people like, who cares? I need my smokes.

Speaker 1:          02:22:07       I used to smell like gasoline when I had the nine, four it because they had a hairline crack in the gas tank, so if you fill it all the way up to the funerals that get in the car. My barracuda, I used to have to drive with him

Speaker 4:          02:22:19       window open, fucking terrible smoke and fumes and shit. We're getting that car. Worst smell. I remember the gasoline smell. I remember that car and I met in that stu about that car and you really broke it down kinda with and they're like, oh, this is a real old school car. Like the problems that people I know have an old schools. They car was built to look great. That was a problem with the suspension, the setup and everything was very low. She was very low to the ground because it was so low to the ground and bottom out on things. Yeah, it wasn't, it didn't handle very well because it wasn't designed for that. It was just designed to be like a really low car, like it was tubbed. So the back, the back area where the backseat is, was all cut out and then the frame was welded and bent up so that the wheel tuck deep back wheel.

Speaker 4:          02:23:07       Well, it looks great. I seen him as stupid as fuck. I watched the being made. Uh, and um, you know, I learned with my friends who got old school cars. Once you've started, you just can't modify. One thing was certain cars, you know, especially when it comes to suspension and wheels and not doing the brakes. Well, you know what they do now, it's really interesting. They do these different companies have suspensions and frames that they build for these old cars. Yeah. That's one of the problems with those old cars. You're like the suspension and the frames are just, it's so whack, which don't have fully independent suspension there. The way it's all set up is so old school, so they have some upgrades and that can definitely enhance the way these cars perform, but now they do say certain companies like art morrison, they take a suspension and they build a frame and it's like say if you're going to build like a 1969 mustang, they would build a frame and suspension for the [inaudible] 69 mustang, and then you take the old body and you bolted down to this modern frame suspension.

Speaker 4:          02:24:09       You have a car that performs infinitely credits and the original car, it's going to be waste, stiffer, it's way better designed, and then they have all these suspension improvements. Now they've figured out a way to make suspensions that adjust the way on modern car does. So it just constantly like thousands of times a second. So if you're driving a car, like if you say like you get a brand new bmw seven series, yeah, those things are smooth as a baby's ass. Just whooo. So comfortable with that. And one of the reasons why they're so comfortable is there, the suspension is constantly adjusting. It's constantly adjusting to whether it's bumpy outside are smooth and every bump that it hits it calibrates what it needs to do to adjust for this impact. And you get this incredibly stabilized, right? I'm doing a shitty job of explain. There's a lot of people right now, there's car experts like you don't know who to go. Cars that make sense. I know enough to kind of butchered that, but this, uh, they know now they know how to do that with old school cars so they can take that 1969 mustang and put a similar type of computerized suspension arrangement in it where it's constantly adjusting to the, um, the,

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       the, the terrain. They're also figuring out how to do antilock brakes on old cars. They haven't figured out that totally yet. That's a little bit of a struggle. My, a friend of mine, he, he bills and sell cars, but he knows exactly which ones he liked. Like the 71 chevelle. Oh yeah. He had the 68 colbert, which I drove, and that was two cars and scary. I drove the 68 cobra mustang. He put 10,000 into the motor and it was like over 500 horses and if it, if it rained a little bit, yeah. Uh, for me it had a kenny bail blower on it. Oh god. And that was my first experience with a supercharger and how hype they are [inaudible]. It's like you could lose control of that car. Easy. And a viper or jews. Yeah. I drove a viper before I drove one of those ones and a rented one.

Speaker 2:          02:26:13       I have valet. I got lucky and just an idol. That call goes. It just goes. Oh yeah. Well you've seen the new ones. Yeah, they have a poll is up. They have this new viper viper ar something I think it's called. I think that's what it's called, attack that attack mode. This thing is fucking insane. It's basically a race car that you could buy, but what they're doing with these vipers is that bringing them to these race cars, these race tracks, and it just breaks every record, every race, every race track. They take it on this thing break, right? Breaks records, and it looks ridiculous. Even the curves straight away. Oh fuck you. At curves. It's got giant tires on it. The tires are super wide and it's got more than 600 horsepower. What is it called? Jimmy acr. Acr. That's it. Easier. You've got to look at this thing.

Speaker 2:          02:27:03       The deep bevels in the hood. Look at that face. Get the fuck outta here. You kidding me? It's supposed to be just a fucking preposterous automobile and you could buy that at a store. I mean, it has ground effects that come right out of a race car, but this thing is insane. When people, uh, review it when the review and that's like you independent canyon going sideways when that far it was just a little bit, you know, if you're going to love it, it's just, that's just long enough. Yes. Less than a second is long enough for fun. Yeah. To, you know, it's a great road. Keep placing more. That shit. Don't shut it off. You know, it's a great road to go to. There's a road off of um, the to chris. Chris. Yeah. Yeah. The, I know what you're talking about. I don't know the name of it.

Speaker 2:          02:27:55       It's a road off the two, but it's like if you take the 2:10 and uh, you head towards pasadena and you go up into the mountains. Yeah. You know, there's this crazy abandoned roads where you might not have anybody out there except maybe like a dude on a motorcycle and everything's like turning and twisty. They do a lot of testing out there. If you go out, they'll use like mules, like a car that uh, they cover, like they would take this car and then they would cover it over with like graphics, even some plastic or something. So you couldn't tell what it looked like. I've seen that before. It's kind of dope. Look at that thing. Jesus christ. Yeah. They trying to get me to go up to somebody trying to get me to go up to the chris highway up there off the two of them are fun.

Speaker 2:          02:28:36       You should go up there, go up there with your card because you don't even have to drive fast. I have a good time up there, but I don't drive on any of them. If there's a car in front of me, I might slow up and wait for it to go by, but I'm doing like 40, 40, which is a lot. That's down. That's downloadable for what'd you post to do with a car like this? You wouldn't be doing that. You'd be going a lot faster. That's the problem with these cars as opposed to like an old car. Like say if you got like an old bmw. You know what? I really like those. I love those. They're cool man. Yeah man. And their little boxy and. But when you drive those things, apparently you feel everything. They're so small. I'll see this. See if you could pull up the smoking tire two.

Speaker 2:          02:29:19       Oh, oh two. Um, he uh, some dude had a souped up one and then not even souped up like you put a giant engine and it was just like a really well done version of that engine, but he's driving around in it. I met matt before he comes. Matt farah? Yeah. He couldn't come to the club is a big comedy fan. He's a good dude. He's, he's a real good dude and he fucking loves cars. So this is a give you some volume on this. This is a course. He's. What I really like about him too is he's like a regular dude. Like he's not trying to pretend to be some super professional presenter. He's just a guy who knows a fuck load about cars and really loves them. And look at this thing, man. What year is that, jamie? They build them up properly from what I can see. No, no, no. That's the name of the car. Jamie [inaudible] doesn't say what year I was running into. They've swapped the interior for this luxe package, which is only available in europe. Let's scoot ahead so you can hear what it feels like when he's driving. This thing, yeah, here we go.

Speaker 5:          02:30:33       An interesting because on the one hand it was sorta bmw's corporate engine at the time, but it actually the way up to and they would use these seasoned m 10 blocks to build their crazy turbo formula one engines and there's a really neat documentary about the history of pedals.

Speaker 2:          02:30:57       See he's a. That's what I'm saying. This is a serious geek when it comes to cars or really knows his shit though. You know what I like when he's in the car with a person who built the car much time and money you put in. I'm going to put all this time and his money and his energy in it and he was like, that's you're not going to find another car like this. He was like, we bought to drive it. Then he'll take off like the brakes, a little squishy and the suspension little off, but it's got a nice little pull to it. Like he just started with this like just disappeared off the title. He is honest. Honest jamie. Sixty six to 77 dope little car man. Well, little fucking beer can though. You know who I had a chance to pleasure to meet and I used to have to try to.

Speaker 2:          02:31:38       I used to drive around downtown and by nine and see if I can find it at night. Magnus magnus. Yeah. I had the pleasure of meeting. Somebody was trying to get rid of a nine to eight and we went over there and he showed us around. Oh yeah. No, he's a real friendly guy here. His place is amazing. There's so many old porsches. I think he's got like one, two, three, four, five, six. He's probably got at least 10 of them no more. I counted like 17 or 17 main room and um, he got some more like the 9,009 s nine, nine, 14. Oh, it's kind a bunch of turbos to quite a few turbos now. He really got into a turbo phase where he's buying those nine, three zero turbos. Yeah. He's an interesting character man, because his love of his crash. You fucked.

Speaker 2:          02:32:29       Oh boom. Did. Yeah, that was really dumb. You got a little silly. He plowed into the back or the side of his car into the back of a giant. It looks like a car carrier, just that's why you're not supposed to drive like that. Byron. It's not supposed to go sideways on public roads. It wasn't that I just, I just my my ass with a little bit. I called it. His cars are all like pretty reasonably horse powered up to magnus has cars, like he doesn't have anything like really crazy, but a shark worst gave him one of their cars to drive around for a little and a shark works made 800 horsepower gt two and magnus a painted it like a different paint scheme. You know, he's a crazy paint schemes. I got a picture with that one. Oh, the guy that was sitting outside?

Speaker 2:          02:33:25       Yeah. I'm their scared the fuck out of me. I drove that car of real scared the fuck out of me. It's one of the few cars where I drove it once. I was like, eh, I'm good. Like this is too much, but I see I see yours and I'm like, I'm good on that. I just want to stop, you know, I liked naturally aspirated because a way of pools in the certain time. It just was like taking like a nice little breather in. There. It is right there. Yeah. I saw that. The car, that car is so fast, it just doesn't even make any sense.

Speaker 6:          02:34:03       Downhill

Speaker 2:          02:34:05       with the gravity. See he's um, he's taken it around some corners here is actually this exact same road where I took it. Oh, I was there at this time. I was there with them when they were doing this. But this car is too fast. It's too fast. I mean it's not maybe too fast for a race car driver, but too fast for a guy like me because it just, you don't like one of the cool things about like that 2002. As you get to ring the engine out, there's a lot of range where you can drive your rev it up and that's where you get your power and you, you can go plenty fast than it. The handling of those cars. A lot of times it's connected to the lightness and the whole. All the feel of the car is coming from the fact that it's not, there's not a lot there.

Speaker 2:          02:34:51       This car is a totally different experience. This car is like all about managing the pedal because if you stomp on the pedal, that fucking thing is going spinning. It's way too powerful, but you know, it's one of those things where they keep coming up with new and improved cars every year. Every year cars get faster and faster and faster. Especially performance cars. They've broken the three second barrier. A lot of cars you could buy today goes zero to 60 in less than three seconds to. There's a gang of them. I want to drive with gotti. Fuck. Was I going to sit in one? Do not drive it with just sitting there. That might as well be a spaceship. The, uh, those neurons. Yeah, those are ridiculous. The um, yeah. My homeboy he built, he built this 69 shelby. The 68 got damaged so the insurance had to cut them a check and he spent that money and built a 69, 69 that I haven't drove and he don't drive it as much because it's worth a lot of money.

Speaker 2:          02:35:53       Look at that 1000, 200 horsepower. That's a lot. That's ridiculous. That's a ridiculous car. I saw one of those the other day in beverly hills. Some was, it wasn't the, uh, the, the yellow, the yellow and black one. I'm. No. What color was it? I don't remember what color. I want to say it was white, but it had arab license plates on it, which is really interesting. They're getting these cars and these super rich dudes from Saudi Arabia, they bring them over for saudi summer. See, that's what's going on right now. Where we are is hot as fuck. Where they live. It's crazy way on where they live is like 150 fucking degrees or something nutty. And so they come over here when they've got crazy oil money, they come over here and they bring that. They bring these cars with their plates that are registered to those other places and they drive them around and they get away with it because they're super rich like is nothing dude. Did you see that shit that happened where these guys were racing in beverly hills? There were racing with a ferrari and a gt three, a porsche gt three and they were fucking racing on a residential street in beverly hills just flying through fucking red lights and the neighbors saw them do it. So the neighbors all we're fucking furious. They're all standing outside on their street, holding up their cameras

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       and filming these guys right here it is right here. This guy has got them oats of ferrari. It looks like. I don't know which version, but then the, the gt three. I mean these guys are a full lying down residential roads. You got two things run at the same time, buddy. You got two windows running. But I'm so while while these guys are doing this, the neighbors are aware of it. So they start

Speaker 2:          02:37:43       filming because it probably do. See you look at it, see everybody. And then. So this car fucking started smoking guys, engine started smoking and he pulled it into his driveway. But look at everybody standing out here with their fucking cameras.

Speaker 1:          02:37:57       They'll realize like, oh my god, this guy's a piece of shit. No one cop insight. That's crazy to me.

Speaker 2:          02:38:02       But it's so funny. Everybody's like, world's school of course going to blow up. Everybody's assuming that car's gonna explode. So they're filming it.

Speaker 1:          02:38:14       So this guy was driving his car so fast and so hard that it caught on fire. So I'll never buy a fucking ferrari by the way, are people should not be designing things. I saw I a, a solid nine. 18 that with the dubai plates on it. They had the nerve to put the silver metallic paint on it. So not only bought expensive car, they put the real. What made the car look chrome? Oh, I've seen that. Justin bieber had one of those chrome fisker. How do I know that? Why? Because I'm friends with jamie. Jamie tells me these things. The cops in shout out to the cops in the beverly hills because they nice. You know, I was coming through the apart, fell off my, my, my pores that holds the alternator and the, and the serpentine belt together. So the car was just lose power.

Speaker 1:          02:39:09       Right. So I'm running through beverly hills. I was going to the summit a, the is a place on mulholland drive. I was standing there and I'm, I'm in beverly hills with no lights on, just driving up the street and the cops pull us over and I turn off the car, can't turn off the car. Well, not because it's not going to come back home. I turn it off. They was like, what? Let me explain to you what's going on, is a piece of mail. Tried to explain to them the mechanics. They was like, nah. I was like, I get out the car and you can do whatever you need to do with this car because I'll here, it's going to be here. And uh, I had my, my african homeboy who I just want to try with me all right. And he's like, hey officer, what's going on?

Speaker 1:          02:39:54       He's not going to show you how powerful this thing is that I do. And he's like, look, I'll work for the artists a lot of guff from visiting from Washington dc. I worked for the national government. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's like, I got the irs notice saying that they should have shot them onsite so everybody's afraid of the irs, the terrify, pull the bags out, yada yada, yada. And then he was like, okay, you're free to go. And then I was in somebody's shrubs and uh, you know, uh, there was a cop right there. He was like, sorry, you don't have to be so close and like in the bushes. And I remember looking at him, but sometimes it's fun having your face in the bush. And I smiled and he was just like, he's like, just step away. They get my jokes, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          02:40:38       Well, there's tents been a. So the pulling people over no lights that say they can't shut their car off. They don't know what kind of crazy shit you're doing. Yeah, that's true. I mean, you pull up to a dude, there's two dudes. One of them's from the, from africa who works for the irs. The other one's a comedian with some weird jokes. Their cars running, they can't, they can't shut the car off. Something to talk about it. Right. But a lot of shit could be going on here. Like whenever you deal with someone who won't, they don't have their lifetime. That's weird. Like, okay, why is this guy not as full time? And then you deal with another thing. You won't show this car off. What, what? What's going on? Like there's a bunch of shit that supposed to happen. One, you're supposed to have your lifetime to get pulled over.

Speaker 1:          02:41:17       Shut your car off. You show your id. Everything is supposed to go according to plan. So you're throwing in all these new poles. So the improv game, we're doing no lights. Okay. Why don't you have lights? I can't. Doesn't work. Altair got an issue. Alright. Shut your car off. I can't shut the car off. Stays here. I'm gonna. Tell you it's is true stuff. When I moved in, I had a honda prelude. I put a time of building it. Fourth generation drove here. I used to get pulled over all the time. Black on black. I, I lived in inglewood and I realized like all the time I get my car search put in the back of police cars and I talked to a cop and he told me about proximity and how criminals operate and when they wake up they get descriptions in the morning and if you fit that description they going to profile you and that's when I realized like, oh, I'm living in the wrong neighborhood driving the wrong vehicle.

Speaker 1:          02:42:02       So when I got denied for four, I get what I call corporate old white man colors that champagne or that boring gray and I just drive and now I have really no problems. You know what I mean? That's what I, that's the thing. It's like how my mind works sometimes to figure out that pattern and be like, okay, this is what it's getting pulled over and stuff. Then I need to, you know, I don't know if it's the survival in your way, but it's like I have to shift and some people real. I'd be like, I don't feel like I should shift like that, but I'm like, you know, the cops, the cops will be like, slow down. I've messed up in the. I was doing 60 on franklin one time just enjoying my life because white women jogging and everything and the street. I'm like, this ain't bad, you know, life is great. I tell jokes and the cops were just like, sir, you slow down. And I remember putting my hand out the window, like no problem officer. Then that was it and I was like, this is amazing right here.

Speaker 1:          02:43:03       But I also experienced another white privilege thing when I had an. I had an accident in the nine, four, four and it was a latino people and the guy got out of the car. The cops showed up and I was sitting on the car, the old white guy, sir, is this your car? And I was like, yes sir. He was like, okay, everything is gonna be okay. And then he went. He lit into the mess and people to where I got uncomfortable for a while. I almost said something to yelling at the mexican people assuming this ain't regulation and where the paperwork for this and asking them all the time, let me see your id. When did you get this? And and me coming from Georgia, not using. I'm used to seeing black people treat it, but no other culture, so to. I almost stepped in but something was like hold on, don't.

Speaker 1:          02:43:45       And I swim sitting on the car like damn, feeling guilty. Like this was white, white guilt feels like, but I'm still on the other side. Right. So I'm just letting it ride. Like, you know, that's funny, but like I said before, it's like when you in that place where you see different stuff, it's shapes you. Somehow it gets that understanding. I think with a lot of cops, something can happen to where they pull over so many people that are illegal immigrants. They start getting upset and start getting upset of that and they treat it like disproportionately. You know? I've seen a lot of fucking people that are driving illegally in los angeles truth. I got rear ended by a dude. That's right. I remember that there was no driver's license, but I know a lot of white people who were driving illegally. They don't worry about it.

Speaker 1:          02:44:36       Nothing happens. But you do. If you get pulled over though, if they find that if a cop finds out, you're driving illegally, you're in trouble. Yeah, for sure. Everybody, no matter who you are, they'll tell your car, but the odds are you're getting pulled over. It's kind of slim. Um, um, yes. The odds are greater if you are black or if you're mexican of getting pulled over. I would say that probably, definitely true. Cut the me getting out the car like this and was like, no, not you. And you're like, oh, I was just stretching, you know. Yeah. But you know this, it's what it is to me. You know what I mean? I wouldn't want to be a fucking cop. Oh no, no. I think me honestly, I think that their job is to nurture to nerveracking for the regular person. And I think so too.

Speaker 1:          02:45:22       And they don't make enough money to go through the mental part of it. Exactly. To affect their relationships and their family. Life. Suicides. Yeah. The cops commit suicide. Lots of cops feel despair. It's a crazy job. This is a crazy job, you know? Yeah. Like, yeah, they got to go. Like I said, I got to go. They got a reputation. Cops have almost a reputation now of a, of a black man to act like they, like people look at them like prejudice against. Yeah. And it's like, oh, to me it's like, oh shit, truths. Ironic. Um, and they have to go in those situations. They have to go to the hood with that reputation. Yup. And that's outfit on. And that's a scary thing. You know what I mean? If your outfit is being represented by people that do and fucked up things like those videos that we were talking about earlier, that's your outfit, that's the team you're on.

Speaker 1:          02:46:14       So you have to go and you know that these people are gonna see you and looking at you and know that you represent that team, that they've been watching all these videos. And I'm from a place where the cops looked like said the cops, they treated you fucked up like, oh, they were dirty. So it's a different ballgame. You know what I mean? Yeah. Um, but that's what it is. It's so much that isn't understood outside of the videos that are being. Do you think there's a way on stage that you can relay a lot of this stuff that you're talking about? Say I feel like, um, if you could figure out a way to make humor out of the difference between your background growing up and what you're experiencing now and you just, you're on your own unique perspective. Yeah, I'm talking, I'm slowly talking about it.

Speaker 1:          02:47:03       Yeah, you can ask. Touch. When I worked with tosh, my opening jail, I walk on stage and be like, not all black lives matter. Some niggas should die and that's a shot. Just 30 seconds. I will get applause break in 30 seconds at the, at the tense time or that. And by that I'm telling them, I explained the story of the protests when traffic is being held up and I'm driving with my gas light on. Yeah, and I'm like, this don't if this, my car dies, I'm a hostage in a situation I don't want to be in. And then feeling sorry for that black guy who's stuck in traffic and don't know why. And every white person looking at him and he liked this ain't got nothing to do with me. I'm just on my way to owners counties. I can fuck this white girl.

Speaker 1:          02:47:49       That was the bit, but all of it's based on truth. But you know what I mean, on truth, I felt like when those black lives matter protesters were shutting down highways, I'm like fucking white people. It was white people that are trying too hard to be dealt with. Black lives matters. So they took it to the highway and shut down the highway. So I knew this one dude is like a super, super lefty guy and he uh, he was a part of the black lives matter shutting down highways and I was like, what are you doing man out in berkeley? But super, super liberal, crazy people. It is a hierarchy of black people just like a of white people. And me and jim martin neighbors, we say some shit like real niggas don't give a fuck about black issues. It's just true because their survival mode, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          02:48:34       You know, so things like, you know, education and shit like that don't really matter who leaving to me. I didn't talk about politics going on. So I really don't care about politics. That's how I feel about it. Like I still got to grind either way. Do you care at all? Like when you, when you're looking at hillary clinton and Donald Trump, like what's your thought? You just don't think about things. I think, and I said this before, before everything got crazy. Trump got crazy. Uh, I understand sometimes where he's coming from through educational purposes. I understand republican mindset, you know what I mean? Because that was taught to export

Speaker 2:          02:49:08       businesses and stuff like that. You know, all that makes sense to me. But I don't think. I think this part is for ratings. I see it as a show and I think, I think trump is like a, uh, a character. Uh, definitely they want everybody to vote for hillary. I think they're gonna lead people that way, like you leave water to go down a certain ravine and then hillary is gonna make a because their personality and the best, like it ain't like a barack obama people be like, oh, like this lady. But I think once you get in, she'd been to kind of personnel is terrible. Well, you know, I think she's going to make some adjustments on the low that's going to really fuck up people. She does things that make me super nervous to sing. Have you ever see the video of her? Was she was talking about uh, uh, gaddafi. She, she's, she was laughing about how uh, she, I think she says we came, we saw he died and it was like off camera and like she, I don't think she realized that she was being filmed or this is just not her behaving like I'm gonna play it for you.

Speaker 7:          02:50:13       This came, we saw he died. Yes, we came, we saw he died. What

Speaker 2:          02:50:23       is basically she's also looking off at someone else, like for their approval when looking at the woman she's talking to necessarily. It's just, that's so weird thing to joke about, the enormity, the magnitude of assassinating a foreign leader, whether he's a dictator, dictator or not, like there's a lot going on there you are overthrowing the ruler of a government even though it was a terrible reader and you are now opening up that government and those people that were being suppressed by that car, you were opening them up to the turmoil of establishing a new leader. That's true. And that's where it is right now. So when you see someone who is running for president and they are joking around about a scenario that has taken place that they were a part of, she was a part of. And that scenario is now directly connected to horrific tragedies and this chaos that, that is an isis stronghold. Now, Libya is nicest store. So I, uh, that, that, that sits in that living situation isn't the. Yeah. Okay. This goes on Libya. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's none. None of those things are good. You know, whenever you have a brutal dictator like Iraq, saddam hussein, it's not good when the world is entertaining. Brutal dictators is a brutal dictator that's in charge of these people. They're, they're, you know, it's not, it's not fair is dangerous and we have to interact with this person in some way. I love a country where there's a curfew and I'm thinking that's going to happen here, but I just love a country

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       where the public has a curfew for women at a certain time and they will. If a chick was out by myself, they just put a straight into van. Yeah. And if the republicans and if a dude was out and his lights wasn't right or he's on a motorbike, the cop got on the bike with him and rolling with it. The jail, he had to take the copper jail. Whoa. Uh, so yeah, it's certain things like, you know, that it's like, wow, that I, that I see like it happened here. And as far as that video, to me that's how people power act. When I say like real, like rich and successful, powerful people like and poor people. I always tell people they don't give a fuck the people in the middle of all the ones that's timid and like, we should do this for animals in that, but those people and poor people like you listened to that jokes.

Speaker 1:          02:52:53       They don't give a fuck. Just like guys I met, we talked about man, I shot three times, man, I shot the first time they go through, he started hobbling. I was like, oh shit. And the gun jammed. I got nervous. Like these are the stories. So I had the ability to sit with both and just the, the, and it ain't, it ain't my comedy is based off this too. So I got to be like one of these people to talking to some of these murders, someone with a gun. It's laughing and joking around about it. It's got to be fucked up, but it's like this guy didn't die but he did get hit, you know, but you hear it's like somebody telling his story and they tell him how bad it was because you know, they live, they live it and it was over something simple.

Speaker 1:          02:53:33       Like I told you next time I see you that this was going to go down, you know what I mean? And it just went down, you know, over something simple. But I always say like the people like that at the top when people at the bottom don't give a fuck and that's. And if you look at the politics and now you got trump and you got to support it. The redneck shit that people say they don't like those top and bottom people that pattern wise. Um, but I think yeah, hillary get in, I think they're trying to lose everybody the whole way and then she's gone on the low side, some document that's really gonna fuck people up down the line. Those are my predictions. Why do you think she's going to do that? You know how you find that outfit? Why? You know, how you found out later on?

Speaker 1:          02:54:14       Like, oh man, that document, that president signed three years ago. Fuck people up, right? Oh yeah. You know what I mean? It was a lot of the us. Yeah. So I think it's going to be something like that. Well, she's gotten away with so much already. That's what I'm saying. She's gotten away with so much already. The idea that she's gonna stop once you get to the office is ridiculous because she broke so many fucking laws where their email server, all the lies that she told about bengazi all throughout her career. There's like, there's many websites document all the time. They've caught her lying about like pretty important issues. The idea that she's going to stop doing that once she becomes president. It's crazy. She's gotten away with it. She lies when she talks about getting caught in lies like what? You talked about the fbi. I'm having this long interview with her about her email server. There's a direct video

Speaker 4:          02:55:04       that shows like the direct comparison between what she said and what he said, what she said and when he said it's horrible. It's horrible to watch. Like how is this person even qualified to run for office? Forget about the fact that everybody wants a woman to be the the new president. I get it. Yeah. That'd be fun for everybody. Yeah, let's, let's do this.

Speaker 2:          02:55:24       The one, six months to that new car smell gone, but this is, she's not the one. This is not the one you don't want.

Speaker 4:          02:55:31       I mean, the only thing good is that she's a longterm politician, so she understands the business. The only thing bad is that she's a longterm politician. She knows the business. So the both things.

Speaker 2:          02:55:42       She knows the business sucks and people don't understand it as a business. You know what I mean? They are mostly caught up in it. Exactly. But I definitely think, I think people like we all should, we could find a better way to do things better. I'm hoping and not put power and like church and government and these things. It's just hard. It's got such a stranglehold. Yeah. The idea that you have to register as either a democrat or republican to vote in the primaries, the primaries decide which candidate is going to represent these parties. It's a show rate. It's never been more obvious. So that's a charade. And I fully never learned learned it because I look at the bigger picture and the pattern. So, you know, um, well byron, we're going to come back

Speaker 4:          02:56:26       four years and we'll see if you're right about hillary clinton if she fucked up because you don't remember just a little while ago, everybody was saying that, that, uh, hillary clinton, that the fbi was going to drop some bombshell and that more information was going to come out about the horrible things that she's involved with and she's done and then she's going to probably be indicted and then she's gonna wind up pulling out and she's not going to be running for president. That was like the big rumors just a few months ago now. Trump has gotten so fucked up. He's done so much stupid shit and said so much stupid shit. Then now, like the harvard republican club for the first time in over a hundred years is coming out against the nominee. The, there's like a bunch of different prominent politicians that have come out against him. Like you don't remember that. Usually by the time someone gets to a point where they're running for president, the republican nominee with mitt romney or anyone else, like they're kind of embraced, you know, like, okay, we've got the nominee, everything's in order, let's move forward. That's not happening now. Even even with the election just a couple of months away, people were freaking out and they got to go. We can't have this guy, this guy can't be our guy.

Speaker 2:          02:57:32       Well, what happened in dr. They got a lady, you know, I'm in charge and it was some sneaky stuff like that, but when she got here, she started doing the curfews and she took the haitians and kicked them out. You know, she gave him to be fair. She was like, you got this amount of money, you can stay a haitian church. Yeah. So it got in. God was showing me scars that allowed them to stay into in the dr. So yeah, it got real for me over there because I finally talk to

Speaker 1:          02:58:02       these dudes that used to be kids asked for money and now they adults asking for money, what's going on? And they started breaking it down like, yeah, let's see. A group of people just like kicked out of a country like that. And he's like, man, maybe we, maybe we should be glad we're lost tribe that could easily be,

Speaker 4:          02:58:19       you know, it could always be worse for sure. Yeah. Yeah. And they look up to us and he was like, you know, it was like, regardless of what's happening, and I know this guy, I know black people getting killed by the cops, but you still got a chance to be something. And I couldn't even say nothing like me while North Korea looks up to them. North Korea, you know, at least they don't have to deal with dear leader. They don't have to cry for hours and hours when his dad died, if they don't cry correctly, they get put in jail for six months and forced to work in labor camps. They have labor camps in North Korea where people are literally starving to death when they sick dogs on them and the dogs eat them. I mean, this is game of thrones type shit and it's going on right now.

Speaker 4:          02:59:00       This guy who he grew up in a slave camp, he was a child of someone who was convicted of some sort of a crime and forced to work in these slave camps, grew up in this camp, did not know the rest of the world, did not know that there was a whole world out there and somehow or another escaped, but he talked about, turned his own family in like they had, um, they have everybody narcan on. Everybody turned his whole family and in his description of the different levels of torture and treatment, like different levels of slavery, what you're capable of doing when you're almost dead, what you're capable of doing. Like they have it like classified, like what jobs you get dependent upon how close you are to death. Fucking terrible man. It's crazy. Like, you know, you hear these stories, you meet people that like one six degrees away from that. Yeah. You know, what's crazy is that it's 2016 and where we're living here in los angeles, this super progressive at the front line of culture, we feel like, well, hey, everything's looking up. Everything's getting great. No, I'm hearing no Korea. You fucked up the world, fucked you, and you got you gotta. This is where you. You came out into the world. That's your spot or Namibia. What we're talking about before an inter rainfall in three years you're like, fuck thirsty, fuck

Speaker 1:          03:00:16       you got all that koolaid and only the interwar to come in. If they even get koolaid to get going. Now is that my mind processed, starving. That's a. There's not a lot of food there. All that peanut butter they're eating and they can't shoot animals and shit. That's all I can do. Byron bowers, ladies and gentlemen. Hey man. Glad we did this experience.
