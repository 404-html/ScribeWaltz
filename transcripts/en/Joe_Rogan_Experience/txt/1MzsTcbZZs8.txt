Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. Do you get blood work done?

Speaker 2:          00:05          Um, I haven't, I, I have uh, I've got prescription to like measure like all, like my nutrient levels and I've just been too lazy to go get it done. That's ridiculous though. You're a professional at the highest level of the game and I'm, I'm an idiot. I don't know, I just, I just, I'm a procrastinator with it because you know, one day I'll, I'll feel like crappy and I'll be talking to my osteopath. It'd be like go get these blood work done, see what your deficiencies are. So we will get a prescription and I'll never go do it. I'm scared of needles. It's a big thing. You're scared of needles. Get the fuck Outta here. I pass out. I'm not joking. I'm not scared to fight in a cage many times doing ivs or stuff like that. Yeah man, I hate it. I sold like when you're rehydrating like when they give you an ivy, you pass out and faint and then I will wake up and everyone's looking at almost attacked for us and a couple of guys because I woke up and didn't know where it was and I was just like, that's sucks.

Speaker 1:          01:18          I used to date this girl who couldn't even watch someone get a needle in a movie. She would black out.

Speaker 2:          01:22          Yeah. Yeah. If I think about it too hard then I'll let get my stomach will like, that's so weird. Yeah. But that's the only logical. I don't understand what that is and it only happened like it only started happening like four or five years ago. Reward like blood because you have to get blood work done for the fights, right. Past your HIV and all that stuff. And before I would just be like, yeah, and it's done. Walk away now. Then all of a sudden out of nowhere, every time I see a needle coming my way, I see my face will get white and for no reason that's so strange. So I have to like, get on my phone like this, I have to lay down like it's a whole host of look away and look. Oh yeah. Distract myself. Wow. Even talking about right now, like, get like a.

Speaker 1:          02:08          that's so strange. I mean it was, it would make more sense. It was something you always had. Yeah. It's so weird. Like my ex girlfriend, her dad had it and she said that her dad one time, um, her brother got like a severe sunburn and the blisters all over him and the Dad saw it and the dad fainted. And what's crazy is that dad was a fucking doctor. He was, he was, he was a dentist. So I'm like, how the fuck is this guy like me? Obviously you must deal with some fucked up shit and gory things.

Speaker 2:          02:38          Stills in dentistry too weird.

Speaker 1:          02:42          He, I guess he was okay with needles, but he would see certain things like he saw his son with blisters from listers because you know, like from, from the sun, from sunburn. And he apparently had a really bad sunburn. It's weird. It's fucking weird, right? Yeah, it's in her family. I guess, but it's weird that you acquired it. That's virtually nowhere. It was just like one, it was, I was doing blood work for uh, a fight and I was at the hospital and that was just like everyday and then I passed out and ever since then it happens. So I have to be really careful. Uh, but this guy goes around and just records people. Regular people walks up to you, records you and puts it online and whatever. He edits it together and puts it on Youtube. What else? Kinda fucked up. Fucked up.

Speaker 1:          03:33          That's very fucked up is he agreed. I wouldn't know who. We know who the guy is, no idea. So he doesn't put himself on ever fuck that guy. So he walks up to people and gets a various responses. Some people like he walks up to chew all this stuff. Got pulled off youtube, but it's on La live leak now. He walks up to two mormons, the ones that go door to door and they're super polite. They're like, whoa. They're like, oh, you're recording us. Whatever. They have a nice conversation and they walk off. But then other people, they're trying to knock them out, but I think it's so. It's so interesting how the camera in and of itself almost has this social view of of like like a weapon in a way. It's like you're pointing that thing at me because you're attempting to take. The person's not doing anything wrong by pointing the thing.

Speaker 1:          04:26          No, no, no. I mean the person that's getting recorded, you're not doing anything wrong. Why does it make us feel so uncomfortable? You're opening up a door for a bunch of other people to enter into your life. If you take a guy, I'll got back. I took a camera on you. I don't know you. I find you take a camera and then I put it on the youtube channel that has a million subscribers like yours does. Well, no, no, no. Let's say the person doesn't know that when they're being recorded. Okay. That right? Like if you're out in the street, probably doesn't count for you because somebody might know who you are and what in that case, but if you're a regular everyday person and someone walks up to you with their smartphone and they're just a few feet away from you, recording you that like that's what he's doing.

Speaker 1:          05:05          He's not announcing that it's going to be on youtube, but people's reactions are intense. Shouldn't be phone still is fun and kick him in the Dick. Fuck that. But maybe he wins. He wins that way. He wins the housing when. Because I stole his phone. No, because that's because that's a way better clip. If you don't get it, if you don't get that phone, oh, I'll get his phone, get his phone. Well, whatever you may, you may be more gifted than others who fail in his clips to get it from him. Like a sprinter. While he's, he, he starts to get he. He moves away at the right time. This guy's crazy. He interrupts like, uh, he, he. There are cases where he walks behind the cash register at Mcdonald's and starts recording people that are making burgers and they're just like, what the fuck? Or in certain cases, like he don't, he walks, he walks into like a, um, a card game that's going on private card game and he's recording it like he takes risks to, to get that footage. But I agree with you. Fuck that guy. But at the same time, I think it sort of unveils something about humanity and how we're not completely ready for a fully recorded future.
