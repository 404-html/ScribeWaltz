Speaker 1:          00:00:06       The Joe Rogan experience,

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       Joe Rogan podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:00:14       Joshua, thanks for being here, man. I appreciate it. I really enjoy your show. Oh, thank you. You're, you're huff post show. I've seen it many, many times and we were just discussing the excellent recent one that you did with Mark Marin, which I really loved, but I had him on Friday. I came to know you because of the, the whole, uh, how should we say this canceled core Baer report thing. This, this ill advised a jump at racism or the idea of racism. Yeah. Someone that's comedy central tweeted something that Kobe had said out of context, out of context. And it was taken up as being a racist quip by an Internet activist. And I had not really, I wasn't really familiar with her. I'd never heard of or anything. And I had her on huff post live briefly and she, she didn't like the fact that I was a white man, that I got myself into all kinds of trouble.

Speaker 1:          00:01:08       I'll just explain exploded into one of those twitter storms. I mean, I think that was partly the precipitating event that and then actually forced cold beer to address it. He did a whole segment on his show about her and about the whole twitter storm on Monday, but it really kind of got traction when I had her on huff post live on. I think it was the Friday morning and um, yeah, we shouldn't go into, I should say what the joke was so that people know because it was, it was really unbelievably ridiculous. It was unfortunate because if she had seen the actual joke in context, it would not have been offensive. Oh, I don't agree with that really. I think she just takes umbrage at things, but figure biggest she likes to. I think there was a, there was a type of twitter reaction that is just a project predictable knee jerk.

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       It's a choice to take things out of context. I agree with that, but I think that it would've been almost impossible if she'd actually seen the full clip. Like she would have had to be on the starting line wanting to launch, but go, fuck, I can't go after them. This is the, what the context was that he's willing to show the Asian community how much I care by introducing the Ching Chong Ding Dong Foundation for sensitivity to orientals or whatever, and it was meant to be a, it was a satire of the Washington redskins original Americans Foundation. So they come up with this original Americans Foundation. So Dan Snyder was trying to, it was trying to say, instead of changing the name of the redskins a, I'm going to give money to like this African American charity. I mean, sorry, native American charity and call bear satirized the redskins by saying because he had been accused of doing some anti Asian things in the past like bits where he just kind of impersonal. It's an Asian or something. So he was like, well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna. Uh, make that right by setting up this Chin Chung Ding Dong charity for orientals or whatever. Right. That was the gag rose. The Gag. Well, it's, it's, his thing is character.

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       I mean, core Cole bear is a, it's like an archie bunker of course. I mean, he's, he's not a real guy. This is a role that he plays a ridiculous, ignorant Republican and that that is, that's, that's the satire, and to miss that and to do this cancel core bear thing. Colbert, same as name, wrong every time, but I never say it. I watch it. I don't say his name, but to do that it just, it, it highlights in the support that he got, but the social justice warriors or the support that she got rather than this by the social justice warriors on this was. It was so maddening.

Speaker 4:          00:03:35       People who should know better joe, they shouldn't fight. I had people, I had twitter hate campaigns coming at me from left right and center from like from black comics who I had known like who should know better because they're comics that it's baffling to me when people engage with one another purely on the basis of their identity and not on the basis of the actual intellectual point at hand, like weird does set high go too far or whatever. Like I was just roundly prevented from having any opinion about what satire is on the basis of the fact that I'm a white man. Yeah, you got to check your privilege son. Check your privilege. Did you check it? I didn't check it. Check it happen. I need to check my privilege APP. I never know what I would sell that is to create an app where you can just click on it and gives you a score from one to 10 about what your privileges. Well, it's an interesting thing

Speaker 3:          00:04:27       because it it. It immediately allow someone to marginalize your opinion by virtue of the fact that you are European or in your case Australian or whatever your whatever your roots are like you can instantly discount

Speaker 4:          00:04:40       any credible point that you might have had. Just to clarify, for people who haven't seen the way that the interview with this Hashtag activist twitter person went, I was basically she was buying. She basically literally said that I. my opinion is completely worthless because I as a white man, I would not be expected to understand the lived experience of women of color. Now she's a 23 year old Korean American middle class. It was a lot, so I don't know what, but what's incredible to me, the struggle is real. Josh, what's incredible to me is that, you know, when you meet somebody and you just get a real sense of like, wow, this person is interesting. They're original or authentic, like this is, this person is a, is a snowflake. I want to, you know, they're a fingerprint. They're like something unique. That's what we should all be hoping for. Right, and we should all be hoping to engage with one another on, on levels that enable us to bring that out in each other. She was the exact opposite of that. Like it was basically an identity talking to another identity. It was a generic. It was a label talking to a label. Yeah. There's an issue with this.

Speaker 3:          00:05:50       This need to correct people that to define yourself by correcting people that I think people are. They're looking for people to step out of line so they can check them and instead of looking at this subtle nuanced life that we live where there's, there's, there's so many different variables when it comes to human interaction and communication. There's so much when you. You're throwing in satire as well, and it's a satire television show. The fact that this is an all put through some sort of a observational filter before you immediately knee jerk react and and, and attack. It just shows that there's a real issue with the ability to communicate. The ability to communicate is a wonderful thing. The fact that we all have it, that you know, you can do your show. I can do my show, we can all tweet, anybody can tweet, anybody can go crazy and just write whatever they want on their blog.

Speaker 3:          00:06:40       It's great. It a lot of ways, but it's also ridiculous because people who have not considered that they do possess the English language, they have the ability to communicate, but what they're essentially doing is just piecing together what they think is like an argument based on these predetermined patterns that they've picked up. Exactly. You know, as you as a white male wouldn't understand a woman of color. What fucking color you. Well, like what, what, how your white. I mean you're, you're Asian, but I mean when you're talking about the color of your skin, you can't say color. You just can't. You might want to say ethnicity. You might want to say, you know, uh, whatever, uh, background,

Speaker 4:          00:07:21       let me clarify that there is. I completely concede that there is a lived experience of being a certain being a minority ethnicity, especially in America or in Australia, new countries that is different from being a white man and I'm rushed. I absolutely concede that. The thing is why can't we talk about the actual details of the experience without assuming that there's a homogeneity between that experience as well. Like not every Asian experience in America is the same. They have certain commonalities in that they're subject to racism in a way that you and I aren't, but they are so wildly different. Let's talk about the details of the experience and what's acceptable and how we, how we want to converse with one another. Let's not assume that because a person has a particular set bunch of labels attached to them, gay, straight, Asian, white man, woman, whatever, that that immediately disqualifies them from having a conversation about these things. Yeah, absolutely. And also

Speaker 3:          00:08:17       this idea of check your privilege. What you're doing is just discounting someone's opinion immediately. You're, you're using it as a tool and it's a lazy tool. It's a lazy tool to look. There's some people that you want to just be able to say, check your privilege. You. You basically want to say shut the fuck up because you don't have the time to go through all the things that are wrong with their arguments, but there are other people like yourself. You're a very complex dude. You talk very well. You're very well spoken, you're very measured and the things that you say, I've watched your show many, many times. You're not a knee jerk reactionary guy. You're not an asshole. So for someone to say that to you, it just shows that this is something that just gets used. It just gets thrown out there like, here's a weapon that I have. We're in the middle of a conversation. Instead of having this dialogue where we're considering each other's points of view and different lives that we've led, he just boom, throw the snow, smoke bomb on the ground, check your privilege.

Speaker 4:          00:09:08       Well, it's also, it's the easiest way to lose

Speaker 3:          00:09:11       good friends too, like privileged checker APP.

Speaker 4:          00:09:16       It exists. It exists. That's the need to check it. That's great. I'm going to download it. I'll download it and check my privilege. It's also the, it's the clearest way to, to lose allies in the fight against racism as well for these self appointed kind of, um, people who, who do these kinds of twitter campaigns and online stuff. And the WHO's who the check your privilege brigade, you know, I am the most obvious ally for antiracist. So I'm like the least racist guy. I should be. I should be, it should be a no brainer for me to release racist non, the less racist guy, the second least racist guy won the race and it's made me what I have to keep reminding myself is this the self appointed spokespeople who uh, you know, for race like this person then not the people who I need to be defending when I'm, when I'm trying to defend minorities.

Speaker 4:          00:10:16       These are, they are, they are doing active harm to the cause. Like the poor black working mom doesn't have time to get angry on twitter. Like I should be defending her. Not a 23 year old Korean American Middle Classico who's making me, who's basically alienating me and all the likeminded people from the legitimate worthwhile pursuit of fighting racism because it makes me feel like, well, if I'm, if I'm going to be rejected out of hand, regardless of what I do, simply on the basis of the fact that I'm a white man. Fuck you. All right, cool. You've just lost an ally.

Speaker 3:          00:10:50       Yeah, that is true. I mean that is a very good point. Um, and another good point is when you're 23, fuck look, she's probably smarter than me. When I was 23, I was retarded when I was 23. I was really fucking dumb and that's just something I'm willing to concede. And if, if you had a video of me explaining my position on anything at 23, at 47, I would have to go, fuck, I'm so sorry. I don't know. I just didn't know anything

Speaker 4:          00:11:18       and stupid. I have some. I have a certain level of empathy for that. I mean, I don't know that girl. So this really isn't, for me, that whole affair was much less about her than about the easy way in which people jump onto jingoistic bandwagons about things

Speaker 3:          00:11:32       and also that they demand cancellation. They demand people getting fired

Speaker 4:          00:11:38       censorious. So it's so dictatorial. It's so. It's so antithetical to everything that we should value about the kind of the great rumbling dialogue of debate. You know, the, the, the first amendment. One of the great things about this country is a whole bunch of crazy people shouting at each other

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       and you know, hopefully the best idea wins in the end. You don't shut people down without a doubt. And I think a lot of these people, they respond. I think a lot of people were very sympathetic to someone who's been bullied and they look at marginalized people, whether it's a certain races or genders or sexual orientation, and they, they immediately stand up for those people because they think those people had been bullied and marginalized. But in doing so, they often resort to the very same tactics that are often used against these people that are marginalized. They become bullies and they rally the troops and that's why this term social justice warrior is so apt because they're attacking. This is like this aggressive campaign. It's not a campaign of psychedelic love where they say like, you, your, your perspective is wrong man. We have to look at this from a different way.

Speaker 1:          00:12:42       And like, you know, there's no, there's no sympathy. This is like a very aggressive sort of movement and you know, you could say that I think it's possible to make the argument that there's a necessity to some of that because I think that the aggression against people that are, have been marginalized, the aggression against certain races and sexual orientations and certain genders, and you could say that it's necessary to have something equally aggressive in the opposite direction to sort of achieve some type of balance. I could see that but, but make sure that what you're targeting is the actual offense. Like don't just. Yes, that's the thing. I mean if we want to have an actual conversation about the boundaries of satire and let's have that conversation, right. It's not canceled core bear and, and you know, that I can't have. Yeah, you're really having trouble with that.

Speaker 1:          00:13:32       And I met. I'm an idiot. You next time you want to say Kobe just in of um, you know, it's, it's so stupid and complicated and it, what also frustrates me is the fact that if someone transgressed as a certain boundary, you, there are certain words that you can say that immediately give the other person the right to disqualify everything you're talking about. There are, there are, there are ways. Like, I'll give you an example. Uh, I'm, I'm, I'm constantly dealing with the immigration department. Obviously you can probably tell by my accent that I wasn't born here. Uh, and as far as bureaucracy is go, I mean it's like, it's as if the DMV had control of your entire existence. It is just nightmarish. It's like pulling fingernails just to get to do the most basic stuff. Like what kind of stuff like, oh, it's just really renewing your visa visa.

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       Um, yeah. I mean, when you are not American and you're here and you have to have the right to work here, there are certain hoops that you have to jump through and that the regulations are so arcane and so it's so difficult to comply with and you know, you fill in a form in triplicate and then it goes through a bazillion different things. Then it comes back as a different, one line was wrong. So then you have to go in and you have to wait for ages to get a ticket to say somebody and then you wait for another three hours and then they tell you that you're at the wrong booth. So you have to go back. And I mean it's just, you know, dealing with bureaucracy is like,

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       it's just a horrible thing to deal with. Um, but I have no recourse against any of that because that's just the power of the state and if, if I want, want to be able to be here than I have to have to cop that. But last time I came into the country I was at wit's end. The battle with stuff. And the immigration officer at the airport, uh, made a joke. He said, I live on A. Actually, I can't really tell the story without giving away my address, but that's where I just don't come and don't hunt me down on people. I live on a strong do it. That won't give you the.

Speaker 1:          00:15:23       I look at the fucking show listening to St Huff Post live man. Alright. Alright. Alright, I'll beat around the bush, please do. Um, I live on it

Speaker 4:          00:15:34       on a street that has the name of a fruit that is named after a fruit. Okay. Uh, and he and this, this guy, these immigration, he was like, oh, I guess I guess you got a lot of fruits there, Huh? Oh No. Right. So okay. Stupid like kind of anti gay quip or something. Obviously I don't come across as Super Gay. So he obviously didn't know that I was gay and he was like, okay, that's fine. I didn't find that particularly offensive. I came out and as I was standing at the baggage claim, I was like, oh, all the indignities that the immigration department has put me through, which is so much worse than that. If I wanted to like get this guy sanctioned, I could complain about that and that little thing which was completely harmless and stupid would be the one thing that they would, that he would actually get censored for. Whereas all the other bullshit that I've been put through because it doesn't fit into the box of having been discriminatory like people can get away with, you know, so if you, if you make a joke that can be perceived as being racist, homophobic, anything like that, all of a sudden it's the worst fucking thing in the world. But you can do anything else and you don't kind of trip the trip wire.

Speaker 1:          00:16:37       No, you're not supposed to make any jokes when you're in those situations. Especially not job. I'm not, but he can kenny though if you complained. I don't think he can,

Speaker 4:          00:16:49       but why? Yeah. But it, it frustrates me that that is such a bad thing. I don't know. Like when did we all get together and decide that some stupid guy, he's probably, you know, he, he, he grew up in a neighborhood where you make a joke about fruits. It's not like, I mean, yes, it's a stupid thing to do, we shouldn't do it. But why is that the worst thing that has been, that has been for foisted upon me by the Immigration Department in the past three years.

Speaker 1:          00:17:14       Well, and what if you were both gay and you were making jokes about straight people like breeders, you know, or he thought you were gay and it turned out you were straight and you know, he assumed that he could make a joke about heterosexual people and then you like, this guy's a fucking asshole. He thought I was heterosexual. I think everyone just has to take a chill pill as saying Australia. Just say that. Here we have, we invented it and we sent it over there. You recycled it back here. It's pretty new for you. I'm sure. We kind of abandoned that in the eighties and we abandoned that once we've invented cars. I was saying you invented cars in the. We did 18. Eighties. All right. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was pretty funny. I still don't know minute which vernacular is Australia in which been accurate roads of American and because you don't like, I'll often say things and people like and I have no idea.

Speaker 1:          00:18:03       What did I say that a day. Oh, that's right. Uh, we will, we will be able to leave work early. And I was like, oh, we get an early mark. Everyone was like, what an early mark. Oh Wow. I've never heard of that. But I like, I've, I've basically been in the states for like 10 years and I still, because you don't notice what you're not hearing. Right, right. You don't notice that people aren't saying early. Mark. My English friends always say taking the piss. Yeah, sure. You're taking the piss. Yeah. Like what the fuck that means that you fucking with somebody. Like if you say are you fucking with them? You make making a joke. Yeah. Yeah. I think we just have to take a chill pill and just let ourselves joke about like when Greg Fitz was on, he made some joke that was could have been construed as being homophobic or something.

Speaker 1:          00:18:43       He was. Oh, that's right. It's saying I'm the first guy who asks another guy out, get to fuck him, and then he was like, oh, that's terrible. I shouldn't have said that. And I was like, I was screaming into my podcast. Go, no, that's fine. That is a. That is a joke, right? It's obviously a joke. It's obviously a. it's kind of a parody of the sort of stupid thing that a straight person who doesn't know. People would say like, yeah, well people are people worried even about a joke that is not mean like a joke about like a Joe. You can make a joke about black guys having big dicks and someone could say that's racist like, but isn't it a good thing to have a big like it's racist in a positive way. Even racist in a pot and it's what we were talking about earlier.

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       People are just at the starting block looking to get upset, but Sarah Silverman has a bit about that. She was on the. Yeah, I think she was on Conan years ago and she was like, um, is it racist to say like, I love chinks and she had the bitch he had wanted to do. She nixed it was she wanted to be like, I love the n word. I love like, and she would have actually said it on the air. So yeah, Nigga. Oh, can't believe you said it. Yeah, you can get in trouble just for that. I know. Then I hate saying the n word. I think it's so stupid and facile, but it's great if you're black and you can just call your friends at. Well I listen, I, I do have some empathy for minorities being able to reclaim terminology and I do think that a black person that has the right to say it, like we've screwed it for 400 years.

Speaker 1:          00:20:17       The least we can do is let you say the word that we can't say. Well, it wasn't we, but I agree with you mean you say we, but I mean really, I had nothing to do with it. You had nothing to do with it. I'm pretty sure Jamie's never owned any slaves. Yeah. But we still have the benefit. We benefit from an institutional system that had, that took advantage of that. So check your white privilege, right? Josh steps. Do we have the APP yet? Can I get a check? They come around, uh, for, for, for, as far as, yeah. Who's at 10?

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       Like Dick Cheney?

Speaker 4:          00:20:49       Yeah. Yeah. I'm Sean Hannity, Rockefeller's, Sean Hannity, you know, those guys were there just like they complete this so privileged that they don't even, they're not even aware of how privileged they are.

Speaker 3:          00:20:59       I would love to get Sean Hannity fucked up on mushrooms. What would come out? Crying tears. A lot of tears. Lot of sadness. A lot of reality.

Speaker 4:          00:21:09       Yeah. More. Or would he just dessert? Would he just peel away like an invisible onion and there's nothing underneath the shell.

Speaker 3:          00:21:16       Most likely. I mean, essentially he's cold bear in a real life for them. Yeah. You know what I mean? That's what he is. I said it right. Yeah, that's good. Good. Good boy. Thank you. Um, he's a parody. It's a parody without knowing that he's a parody and it's a lot of the way bill o'reilly is. It's like they play to these people with nine volt brains. They have these people that live in is very small box of ideology and this box only contains a few support our troops and Falcon the need to keep my guns and gays are trying to fucking marry and that's going to ruin the and Obama's a fucking Muslim. It's like this box these people live in and if you can fit into that box project, that frequency, you can make a lot of money.

Speaker 4:          00:22:04       It's the same as what we're talking about, about the labels, you know, they basically, they live in a world of labels and order. Yeah. Um, and you know, people, especially Sean Hannity, I think Bill O'reilly is a smarter Guy Than Shawn Hannity and sometimes diverges from the orthodoxy, but Hannity is literally a puppet for a grab bag of, of pre packaged ideas that come from Roger ailes. And that's it. He's a spokes means just a spokesperson. There's no independent thinking going on there and profits from that and I mean, I think that happens on the other side as well. Going back to the whole canceled Kobe. I think the people who are, who are doing that are also just plucking out of a preset, um, you know, it's a jigsaw puzzle box when they've got all the little pieces of things that they believe and they're not open to listening to other people or considering new ideas. What is this something that's Suey Park tweeted during that time

Speaker 3:          00:22:55       period. Racism and whiteness go together. Only white people can be racist. I mean, that's just a product that is so awesome. What is the question? You're assuming that whites are more racist than others and that racism by whites is worse than racism by first versus whites. Dumb question. Racism and whiteness go together. Only white people can be racist. That is awesome.

Speaker 4:          00:23:21       I, it just depends on you. Then she's just not using the term racist.

Speaker 3:          00:23:25       She's in the bears, which he is. Yeah, she's at Cole bear on the other side. She's Sean Hannity, you mean? Well, both. She's a female parody. Yeah. Kobe. The character without willing to do willing fully doing it. Yeah. Without consciously doing it. She's doing that. Yeah. That's what that was saying, that only white people can be racist.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       Jesus Christ. That's so crazy. Did you. I mean any. Anybody that has seen the. The riots in La when they pulled white people out of cars and hit him in the head with bricks, I'm pretty sure that's kind of racist about what they did to the Korean community and so fucking Korean. Exactly. Absolutely. No racism. Exactly. I mean just a child. It's a child with ideas that don't really vet out under scrutiny. What offends me more frankly about that particular tweet than the house been how stupid it is. Just the mangling of the English language in abusing the word racism. So much like I'm an English major. She's just not using the word racism in the meaning of the word. If racism means that you judge people on the basis of their rights rather than on the basis of their individual attributes, then of course just definitionally anyone can be racist, have any rights.

Speaker 1:          00:24:30       Of course, not only that, there's many people inside of a race that are racist towards others that vary in that race. There are many black people that are racist against darker black people. Right. That is a fact. That's a fact. Often discussed in the African American community and it happens in Asian communities. That happens in India a lot. There are, you know, there are seven eleven's in India that have full of face creams that make your skin water. Yes, absolutely. Well, in the Philippines Gludethyon, which is a, an amino acid or an antioxidant, rather. They inject glutathione and they, they, they use it as a way of bleaching the skin. It's like a very common practice. It's bizarre and it's roots are not just in, it's not a cosmetic thing. It's a race thing because look, there's a lot of white people that are fucking tanning themselves, so they look like orange, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:25:21       I mean, what is that? That's an aesthetic, right? They're trying to look different. These people are there. They're trying to be wider. Yeah. It's, it's a really creepy thing. Yeah. And if you want to end up with a world, I mean, something that I'm passionate about working towards and I hope will eventually happen is a world in which we have basically ignored rice to the greatest possible extent where we are all just treating each other as individual human beings. Trying to find what's special about one another, giving people, giving each other the benefit of the doubt and not teaming up against each other. How do you best foster that? How do you best bring about that? You don't do it, I don't think by hunkering down into your tribe and throwing pot shots at other people because of their race or agenda. I mean, give me a break.

Speaker 1:          00:26:07       Yeah, I agree. I think it's actually happening now and I think that what we're seeing in this cancel Colbert thing and what we're seeing with these social justice warriors, although I think it's ill advised, I think what it is is the adolescent stage of this growth, this social growth that we're undergoing right now, and I think that we're in this process of understanding each other that is unprecedented as process of exchanging information that is unprecedented. And I think that the negative aspects of it is that, yeah, you know, you have to deal with some people that do have limited patterns of thinking and they'll just, you know, Hashtag cancel Colbert and Suny Park's

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       my hero and you get all that kind of shit. But I think this is a long process of hundreds of years. But in this process, and this, this, the time that I've been alive, I was born in 1967, so between 67 and 2014, where we're at right now has been in epic change in culture. I mean, unbelievable. When I was a child. Um, I, I was born in New Jersey and I moved to San Francisco when I was seven and I grew up around a lot of different people, so I didn't, I did. There's a lot of things that I didn't understand about like racism and homophobia. I, when I moved to Florida, I was 11 years old when I moved to Florida and um, my um, my neighbor, this kid that I used to hang out with his, his dad was getting super angry that black people or that gay people rather we're allowed to get married and he through this fucking newspaper down because you can't fucking believe this shit.

Speaker 3:          00:27:40       They're trying to get married. And I remember it was 11, a fucking silly bitch. This guy is like, what do you give a fuck? My neighbors were gay in San Francisco. I grew up next to gay people. They were always there. I did. I totally didn't understand it. And between that and today it is very rare that you come across someone who actually gets angry in any urban environment. Yep. The gay people were going to get married. It's pretty much accepted like hook me. There's the, the. There was always this economic argument about fucking insurance and some, but I always felt like those were bullshit arguments because how is that affecting. You don't really raising your insurance rates

Speaker 4:          00:28:15       and understand all that stuff. It's like when jared did you, did you notice my interview with Jeremy on it by any chance last year? It blew up momentarily when he said that for a minute. What's his word? And he basically said if you have gay marriage than a father could marry his son to avoid death taxes because if you want it to pass on his estate, then then you could marry your son and then you'd be transferring the property to your spouse instead of to a kid. I guess you could. This is Jeremy Irons and actor, the actor Academy Academy Award winning actor, but it was probably just pointing something out. That's right. That's right. And then the British, because he's very, very famous in the UK. The British press picked this up and you know, how crazy the British tabloids can be and it was like a huge, huge firestorm over there.

Speaker 4:          00:29:04       Um, and I felt bad. I felt sorry for him because it was a, you know what it's like when you do a long interview and you just say something, you know, it was a 33 minute interview and he's, he, he mused on that in like the 31st minute of the interview and if you know, you just chatting on a couch feels casual. He just thinks he's rising a kind of thought experiment and then the British press will go crazy about Jeremy Irons speaks out against gay marriage in a slightly unfair way, but that's the kind of like stupid us thought experiment that obviously. So if that ever happened then you would just change the law about incest, right? Right. It's a nonissue.

Speaker 3:          00:29:38       Is it legal to marry your son? No, not even legal. No. No, I don't think so, but maybe it is. I don't know. It's hard to imagine whether or not they would ever actually bothered to write that law because what if a son, I mean, let's throw this out there. It's even more offensive would. If a son and a father, they're both consenting adults and they decide they love each other. No one have sex all the time. Who's to say that that's bad? If they like it, they both like it. If the sun's 30 and the father is 50 and they said, Look Dad, I think you fucking hot. Let's. If they both agree. I mean if you're not talking about children you're talking about and there's no history of sex between them whatsoever. There's no slow indoctrination by the dad. Look, I basically think that we should have the largest amount of freedom.

Speaker 3:          00:30:23       Yes. It's consistent with a society that in a culture that function, so I wouldn't say that that should be against the law, but it's hard to disentangle that from the power differential there is between a father and a son. It's to imagine dirty. My Dad. No, no fucking power over me when I was 30. Yeah. I think that certain point in time, I mean 40 and 60, you know, you're really older men and if it was like 120 140, then now we're talking. But that's hard to fuck a hundred 20 year old man they break. Yeah. You know, I just don't. I just don't think there's anything wrong with two people that consent to do what they both enjoyed doing. And I know this is a weird example, but I think that as long as they both enjoy it, like why do we care? And we care because of the confines of culture.

Speaker 3:          00:31:11       It's one of the interesting things about animals. Bonobo monkeys will have sex with everybody except the mother will not have sex with, with the sun. That's interesting. The father has sex with the sons, the father of sex of the daughters. The brothers and sisters have sex. Brothers have sex with each other. Everybody has sex with everybody. Everyone's gay. They're all bisexual except the mothers. I get out of here, bitch. No Dick from you. Interesting. Yeah. That's the only the only boundary that they will not cross, which is fascinating. I should emphasize that if people are watching this and I look horribly claiming it's because I'm sick. You don't look clammy, you look fine to do by. Um. Yeah. And I appreciate you getting in here and doing this. I really do. No problem. I, I'm allowed to pollute you. I didn't want to pollute anyone else in the house was fine.

Speaker 3:          00:31:55       I take antibiotics. You'll be okay. And there's only two of you in here. I didn't want to never get sick. The kids, a fucking soldier really? He'll be fine. Good for him. Um, but again, it's sort of the same thing that Jeremy Irons thing. It's this desire to be offended or this green light to be offended. You see the green light go hit the gas. We got one. We got an opening time to be pissed. I do think that this is a part of a process. I think this is a part of a process of along with the erosion of privacy, along with the, the symbiotic connection that we have to technology which is connecting us and some sort of very strange way and this erosion of privacy, symbiotic nature.

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       Of the, the technological world that we live in, and then on top of that, all these opinions that are coming in like this distribution method of twitter and social media and facebook. You could just, you could make a facebook post that resonates and within a couple days fucking millions of people can see it. Hey, alex from target. Who's Alex from target. Oh, you've been up in the woods. I have. There's been a viral meme last week. What happened? I want to talk about, you know, Canada holidays. Well, um, uh, there was this photo of this, of this 15 year old checkout guy at target who was cute and a girl tweeted it and twitter blew up with just retweets of this picture of this kid who suddenly begun. He went from 144 twitter followers to 600,000 twitter followers in like 24 hours. Holy Shit. Just because teenage girls thought he was adorable.

Speaker 4:          00:33:31       He ended up on Ellen. Oh my God. Yeah. Alex from twitter. Hashtag Alex from twitter. Blew up the world, blew up, blew up the incident. He is a little cutie pie. Let's look at Alan. Good for her. She's the best. She's awesome at that. Um, so yeah, I mean when you're talking about how things can just spiral out of control, this connectedness is insane. The spontaneity I'm a little bit worried about whether it's getting too crazy. Like, I mean it reminds me like Nuremberg or something. It's like what happens if you get a bunch of crazy bigots? What, what happens if you multiply the thing that happened with, to me with cancel callback by a million times. Like he could just overwhelm your consciousness, can overwhelm your life. You can, but, but your life is going to be different. I mean, it's changed Alex's life, that's for sure.

Speaker 4:          00:34:26       For sure. Damn sure. Do you know what that kid's father must be like all day, but he's had winning propositions. I'm sure it's probably just the amount of sheer photos of vaginas sent his way. His iphone going to need one of these big 128 gigs and so, oh Labia. Although I just is just getting bombed. Or imagine if he becomes like a famous person, like he gets a reality show or something like that. And why not? I mean if honey booboo can get one, how about, you know Alex from target when you're talking about the Bonobos as well, like that's a whole other element of human sexuality that you can open up in terms of terms of overcoming labels and overcoming the way that we think about each other and the boxes that society wants to sort of fill us in. There been a lot of societies where people were a lot more bisexual than they are in this society right now.

Speaker 4:          00:35:17       Almost all of them in ancient Rome and Paris in the 19th century and a lot of Polynesian islands and things like that. So in the great kind of sweep of trying to become a culture that's more accepting of individuals and individuality. That's something that I hope happens that you, that we do where we are less sort of judgmental about the way that we think about each other's sexuality. And I think that sometimes the gay. I'm kind of going off on a bit of a tangent here, but just while it occurs to me sometimes the gay community or the gay lobby, the extremely, you know, pro gay lobby can do a disservice to the sort of mission of sexual fulfillment by requiring you to pick a team by requiring you to buy, but making it seem like gayness has a certain politics and has a certain fashion style and has a certain way of speaking and way of behaving and that you have to defend that and, and fight for it. Why can't you just Shag who you want and love anymore,

Speaker 3:          00:36:17       you know, by picking a team. Is that an issue in the gay community? Like if someone is gay, then they decided to be straight for a little while. They get criticism. Yeah. That's funny. Well, I mean imagine if. Yeah, that's like the opposite of what they should be promoting. I mean, the whole idea about the ability to be gay was like, leave me alone. Let me do what I want to. If I'm not, you know, if I'm not hurting anybody, if it's consensual, if this is what we both enjoy doing, why do you care? Why do you care? Because you have to care. Because this is, this is a fight that we have to fight, you know, can, can a person also like this. If you're a meat eater, can you have a salad? I mean, if you're a vegetarian, you're right, you don't eat meat. But if you're a person who eats meat, can you have a fucking salad? If I see you eating a salad like we do with that salad, pussy

Speaker 4:          00:37:10       and like, then that's great. But it's also not like a. If something, if like a tiny flick of animal blood has like been on one of the pieces that one of the billions of pieces of lettuce that you ate, like that's not a sin. You know what I mean? Like their, uh, their uh, their, uh, now at some whole foods different, um, uh, what do you call them? Bread cutting machines for the organic bread and the nonorganic bread because people are so crazy about their organic bread that they don't want to crumb of non organic bread to touch the organic bread. That is a religion.

Speaker 3:          00:37:45       Just cry, cry. They don't understand what organic even means and then when you're having bread, okay, this is the reality of food. If you are having bread, it is changed from the wheat that used to exist in the early 19 hundreds from the early 19 hundreds to today. The wheat that you have has been modified and genetically modified. It's not genetically modified in a laboratory where they're splicing genes, but it is the sense of natural selection. They've they've. They've selected on natural manmade splicing plants together with scalpels and shit. What they've done is creating. They've created a heartier plant that can survive better, has better yields, and it's. I mean, what is organic? It just means it doesn't have pesticides. That's right. I think that's the main thing they care about when you're slicing and you're not getting in front on pesticide stupid because it becomes a kind of a spiritual

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       thing almost. It's like a, it's like you have to pray to the gods of the organic. God's. Yeah. Well the vegetarian option, you know the whole thing. My favorite is the vegans who have cats. Yeah, because guess what? Fuck face. You're not a Vegan. If you're fucking buyin murdered animals that are stuffed into cans for little tabby and you see all these people, they have their cats and they don't believe in animal cruelty, but yet the fucking cats. Those cats are cool as shit. I have this, I have two cats, but I have one cat. She's this big fluff ball. She's 18 years old. I've had it forever. She's a sweetheart. She Meat Company come near me. I was at Yale. You pick her up. She starts purring immediately. She's the best cat. She's a fucking murderer. If I leave her outside in the courtyard and a bird is stupid enough to come near her, she will snatch that fucker.

Speaker 1:          00:39:23       I have a sky, snap it's neck and bring it in and drop it at my feet. Yeah, and she thinks it's fun. I mean, she's not hungry. She's not starving to death. She does that shift for a goof. She's a fucking bowl of food. They're full all the time. She wants. She can eat. She's a fucking murderer and that's what you have. If you are a Vegan with a cat, you are harboring murderers and if you're not, if you're not, if you're one of those crazy fucks that tries to feed your cat some sort of vegetable based food, you're killing your fucking cat. Okay? That cat's going to have organ failure. They're going to go blind is also too crazy shit that happens to cats when you try to feed them vegetables. There's this weird sense in which the kind of Vegan movement, and I have to say I have a fair bit of sympathy for them because I do think that the way that we.

Speaker 1:          00:40:08       What we've done to industrialize agriculture is a travesty. Horrible, so we will look back in 100 years that the way that we simply treat animals purely on the basis of, of minimizing the cost, the number of pennies that we have to say Scott's down of their flesh and we will. I think we will regard that as almost being like a slight, a form of slavery. I think it will be so morally abhorrent, but the response to that, my response to that is similar to your response to that which is alright, let's try to feel more like we're part of an ecosystem in which we actually a more related to the food that we're eating into the animals whose lives were taking and let's have some comic responsibility for that rather than just buying, you know, chicken breast in Styrofoam and trying not to think about the chicken that it actually came from.

Speaker 1:          00:40:50       I don't think the correct response is the Vegan response, which is to sort of imagine that humankind is distinct and disjointed and detached from the rest of the ecosystem and the like. The what the cat does to the bird is fine because that's natural. But for us to eat meat is not natural because what we're morally conscious creatures who aren't part of the ecosystem. We are out of the ecosystem. Like you can have a problem with the way that certain types of food are raised, but I don't think it's kind of morally consistent to think that we, we, that it's wrong for us to partake in the same kind of cycle of life, that the rest of that all other species do. The idea is that we are

Speaker 3:          00:41:33       the highest form of animal on this planet because unlike dolphins, we can actually alter our environment and I think dolphins are probably in the same range as far as intelligence goes. If human beings, they have incredible minds, they have dialects, they have the ability to communicate, they formed bonds and packs. They play with people and also they don't show any violence whatsoever towards human beings, but human being show violence towards dolphins. So there's a lot of like really super positive characteristics about wild dolphins that quite quite fascinating. More so than even monkeys or chimps. Chimps don't eat babies. Chimps will steal human babies and eat them. They'll rip your face off their fucking horrible monsters. That's our closest relatives, so it could be argued that in some way, even though dolphins can alter their environment, they have a, a very commensurate level of intelligence that human beings have, but we consider ourselves the highest because we can alter our environment because we have opposable thumbs and the whole deal.

Speaker 3:          00:42:27       Um, but if, if you are the highest form, you should set the highest standards. Our understanding and our ability to communicate these ideas lead us to this thing where we say, okay, we are causing animal suffering and cruelty that is unnecessary and I want to leave the smallest footprint possible. I want to grow my own vegetables, eating them. And that's it. Yeah, sure. But they also won't even eat eggs, which is ridiculous. I have chickens, I have 24 chickens. They lay eggs every day and they don't care if you take them. Chickens never become a chicken because there's no rooster, so they just lay an egg and you can eat that egg and it's super healthy. Would they have a problem with eating human eggs? I don't know. I have a joke about that, about if your wife was in the period every, every month, once a year or once a month, rather, they had an egg, dropped an egg, which, what would you do if it can't become a person?

Speaker 3:          00:43:18       We just let it go to waste. You ate it, throw it in the backyard. Let it fucking go. Finalize your food. That's the other thing. Like why do it, why are we so speciesist about what species where we. I mean I've, I have, I've eaten dog in Vietnam. And did you eat dog? Yeah, I mean, what was that like? Not Great. That weird you out? Um, I kind of felt like, again, I almost felt like it was a moral responsibility to do so because I eat pigs which are at least as intelligent as jugs and show as much empathy as Doug's. So why? Where is it morally consistent for me to be okayed and bacon and not. Okay. Eating dog. That's just bias. My friend. Ada Coyote. Cool. Yeah. It was for a mediator. My friend Steve Rinella, because he was tired of people asking them. He's a, it's a hunting show and he's very unusual for hunter, very educated, very well read, and very articulate, and he was tired of people asking him, have you ever eaten a coyote? So fucking shot a coyote and ate it. It cooked, cooked it on the show. That's great. Yeah, and you know it wasn't bad. I guess mates mate. I don't know about that. It varies. I mean certainly varies. There's a big difference between some forms of meat. I mean, I don't mean to say that all that. However you rise, mate, it's all the same thing, but I think a wild

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       species of wild species, it's going to have flesh that is edible. Most likely edible. I've never heard of anybody eating a wolf except for that movie. The gray thing on that, but it tastes like shit. Apparently there's certain animals to just tastes really bad. Like a friend just got back from Africa and he said the one thing that the local villagers will not eat. His hyena. Oh yeah, they'll even eat lion. I can imagine that they'll eat lion. Apparently Mountain Lion is delicious. Yeah. I've talked to all these hunters that say that mountain lion and there's all these mountain lion rest. I googled it. There's mountain lion recipes online. Yeah. They say it tastes like pork. Well, yeah. I mean why you say kangaroo a lot. Back in Australia, that's an increasingly popular maintenance. Australia is a real great. Like Venice. It's very gamey and lean. Really delicious.

Speaker 1:          00:45:18       They are. I didn't know how fucking muscular Kangaroos. Jesus Christ. You ever seen the video of the kangaroo choking the other kangaroo unconscious? No. Oh my God. I probably opposed to see this as. As an Australian. Yes. It's fairly recent. These two kangaroos are involved in a fight and this one kangaroo gets this other kangaroo and a fucking choke hold with his arms and clamps down on the Kangaroos neck and literally gets into a Jujitsu position and puts this fucking kangaroo and the kangaroo just collapses. Meet good. Chokes the blood out of it has to have some sort of a thought process behind doing that. Yeah, sure. I mean, they're an interesting. It's such an interesting species in Australia and flowing. The reason why Australia has all these weird animals is because it broke off from the rest of the continents in the company before, only the other students.

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       That was our logo one hundreds of millions of years, so there's a parallel evolution essentially, and if you look at the face of a kangaroo and you look at the face of a deer, very similar, very similar. They occupy basically the same ecological niche, but because Australia was a here at his video will say, well, check the. Because Australia broke off so early. They would just get these random like this. The beauty of I love evolution. I think it's just so interesting because I guess they've got longer distances to cross in Australia and they did elsewhere and it's dry and arid. For some reason. They just stopped bouncing it basically bouncing, dear wow. And on two legs. The other weird that. Well there's a. there's an animal called the diker, which is a type of antelope that lives in the Congo that can actually swim underwater as much as a hundred yards and eat fish. It's a fucking carnivorous antelope. They've all evolved, apparently with the Congo used to be was grasslands and as the climate changed, it became a rain forest and as it became a rain forest, a lot of these animals that are traditionally grassland animals became trapped like rhinos. There's rhinos that are trapped in the rain forest of the Congo and all these antelope and deer that are running through these swamps and the swampy like forest thick, thick, thick wooded areas and this one animal figured out a way to get smaller

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       and actually swim under one. Are these short little legs good for him. Fucking crazy though, and this all happened over a period of like 2000 years. It wasn't like a long time. Yes. The very short amount of time. It is true. Yeah. It's a fascinating thing about the Congo. Wow. Yeah. This area where these natural selection, it's got to be some other force at work. No natural selection

Speaker 4:          00:47:51       full of jeans that quickly and just a couple of thousand years, but maybe you.

Speaker 3:          00:47:54       I'm talking about school, obviously I'm not a geneticist, but I think there's been some evidence of extreme changes in evolution over a very short period of time. Like for instance, people that live in Hewitt, people that live in the extreme northern areas, they've developed this ability to not get frostbite and to also keep their hands warm and extreme cold conditions and they believe that this has happened between a 10,000 plus years ago when the ice bridge between the, uh, the bering strait between the Asian continent and the North American continent existed, but they could travel back and forth. And the people that still live there, they have literally changed. They've changed to absorb.

Speaker 4:          00:48:36       Look, I guess if someone, you know, you can imagine that if someone, if a kid is born with a propensity to not get frostbite in his fingers, then he's more likely to survive, to procreate than someone who doesn't. And that can shake itself out over the course of general.

Speaker 3:          00:48:49       There's certainly that. There's certainly that, but I think there's also, there's something I believe, and this is just me talking, there's something that I believe about life where it finds a way life finds a way just like these, when they first discovered that there's life at the bottom of the ocean and these crazy volcanic dream of files and it's like, what the fuck is that? Some of these tiny little animals that just aren't incredibly hot volcanic vents in temperature. Yeah. Yeah. So that's why when they look at like the Moon Europa, one of Jupiter's moons and it's covered in ice, but there's water underneath it. Like what the fuck is going on in her? That's so exciting. Yeah. I mean, there might be some lifeforms that reminds, reminds

Speaker 4:          00:49:27       me when you said something, you said something a moment ago about the moral, uh, about morality and dod. That's right. Dolphins and stuff. I was interviewing Neil degrasse Tyson about extraterrestrial life and I was saying like one, there is a fear that maybe as civilizations become as intelligent as we are, that they kind of extinguish themselves once they, once they get the capacity to destroy themselves, that within a few centuries or millennia they sort of do and that that's why the universe doesn't seem to be teeming with life and he was like, you know what? I think that if, if you evolve to a position where you're able to destroy yourself, then there's another type and those basically saying like if what if extraterrestrial civilizations did come and visit us, you know, Stephen Hawking says that would be the worst possible scenario there where there are no instances of advanced civilizations meeting less civilized civilizations and it going well for the less developed civilization. Right? I mean, just look at what happens on our planet. Why would that if an extraterrestrial civilization came and visited us, would they just exterminate us or use us as their slaves and Neil degrasse Tyson and saying if they had gotten so advanced that they were capable of traveling across the cosmos then and they hadn't destroyed themselves, then you would like to think that they'd been a moral evolution as well as just a natural physical, biological evolution and that they would not do that because otherwise they would have killed themselves before they got here.

Speaker 3:          00:50:52       Right, but the counter that would be obviously that if they did develop this and they came over here and they realize how fucking scary we are with nuclear weapons and sucking every fish out of the ocean and polluting every fucking place we get a chance to set up shop. Wouldn't they see us as a threat to the entire ecosystem of the planet if we were just leaving nuclear waste as we've done in holes in the ground in Nevada and polluting Fukushima to the point where they're trying to figure out how to dig a hole and freeze the outside of the hole so they could fill the hole up with nuclear waste that will be toxic for longer than there have been humans in this particular shape that we find ourselves in now. I mean, if you go back to 200,000 years ago, you're dealing with essentially a different kind of human, right?

Speaker 3:          00:51:39       I mean if you go to Australia, I mean, what does that like a million years ago and then whatever the lower hominids were before that, you get to take 200,000 years ago. That's kind of like a monkey person. Yeah. Yeah. Basically. And that's what we're talking about with this fucking toxic waste. Yeah. We're talking like hundreds of thousands of years of toxicity. It's horrifyingly are responsible. I cannot believe. I mean. Right. And if you were an alien, yes, you would look at that. Look at these crazy pink monkeys with their fucking bang sticks and their nuclear waste. You guys are assholes that you would just look at the history of how we treat other species on this planet and how we treat each other. This is a very undeveloped, like this is the. This is as undeveloped as you can be and still be civilized. I use that term is sort of in quotation marks, civilizing comparison to chimps that eat your face off.

Speaker 3:          00:52:28       Yeah. Well I just made civilized in that you can build spacecraft and conk up arithmetic and stuff. Yeah, and send video through the sky and into someone else's phone. It's all. I mean, we're obviously super fucking advanced for what we know of in the past. Yes, we're good toolmakers, but we're about as undeveloped like morally and intellectually as you could be and still be a toolmaker this good, but is it possible that that is a part of why we develop things in the first place, that we're trying to do battle with our instincts and that we're trying to in our, in our desire to innovate and our desire to create new technology and expand our capabilities that we're also doing this to sort of combat what we really are primarily this, this deep urge that we have to fuck and to kill and to feed ourselves and to sleep and all these biological urges.

Speaker 3:          00:53:22       We're trying to fight against that and try to. That's the of civilization. When you look at every space movie that talks about like the future and the future, everyone is super calm. They're all like reading minds or they're doing things with their hands and no one's physical because no one doing crossfit in the future. You know what I mean? If you look at this fucking movies about the future, no one said yoked. There's no dudes that are fuck who's pushing? Come on, 10 more pushups. There's none of that in the future. The future is not a physical thing. The future is we've evolved past the physical. We're communicating with our minds were levitating things. We're not using kinetic energy, we're not using muscle and

Speaker 4:          00:54:01       bone and blood and maybe that will be true. I mean, the other thing that fascinates me is what's going to happen with artificial intelligence and you know, there are guys like Ray Kurzweil who thinks that within the lifetimes we're gonna be able to upload our intelligence into computers. And I was actually speaking to an. I was interviewing, I do another podcast called point of inquiry, which is for the center for inquiry. It's that it's a nonprofit that spreads science and reason and secularism. Atheism. And I was speaking to one of these guys who works in the field of extraterrestrial life, like what he, he literally gets paid to, to plan for what we will have to do if we discover civilizations in other parts of the galaxy. And um, I just lost my train of thought about how I got onto that. But, um, eh. Oh, that's right. So I was like, why haven't we found an extraterrestrial civilization? Yet? He was like, well, maybe the reality is that biological intelligence as biological civilizations quickly find a way to turn themselves artificial and we're looking for the wrong thing we're looking for. We're looking for biological civilizations, but it may well be the case that within a few centuries we will all be in. We will all be intelligences living inside of kind of computers and the the need for biological human beings will have passed.

Speaker 3:          00:55:16       I think that's very possible. Not only that, if we do develop something that is artificial that is far better than what we are, the argument of why we keep the biological life alive, kind of a road map. What? Why do we need to shit and piss and eat and what? Why do we need to do that? I mean, we only need to do that because that's the best option. But if we come up with something in a laboratory, if they slowly they've combined spider silk and human cells and created an artificial skin that is bulletproof. I mean, this is all proof of concept right now, but they believe they will be able to develop artificial human skin. That's fucking,

Speaker 4:          00:55:57       I want to be bulletproof. Make it happen. Yeah. But then people would be shooting everybody and fuck you worry about it. They're already a sort of, um, I'm agnostic as to whether or not, I mean it's, it's a big philosophical question rather than a scientific question as to whether or not a computer could feel the way that I do, whether I like this. This is taking for granted this, this, this assumption that Ray Kurzweil style, singularity assumption takes, takes for granted a fundamental premise that I have trouble taking for granted, which is that if you added up all of the data that's in my head right now and you put that into a computer, it would have to be obviously a much more sophisticated computer than anything we have right now, but assuming that you could, that that computer essentially would be me. It would feel like me. I would be in the computer. Now that's a. that's a question for philosophy of mind. That's not a question for science because what we really don't know is what it is. What under under goods. My experience of being myself.

Speaker 3:          00:56:57       I also think there's an issue with why's it so important to be you? Why is it so important to be a person but you do like you but you like you because it's the only thing you have ever known and this is the highest form of life that we know currently, but if you think about how many people are fucking depressed and saddled down with emotions and relationships and just the stuff we're talking about today involving racism and homophobia and all these issues and social justice warriors and fucking Uber Conservative shitheads and if you look at all of this stuff that we have to deal with just because of the fact that we're biological lifeforms, existing and cultures and all these different emotions that we have to struggle with on daily basis. If we could figure out a way to just shut that off with a switch and be the enlightened robot. Things who are far better don't get disease and figure out a way to experience pleasure and it's in a level that is just unprecedented body. Last week I have

Speaker 4:          00:57:52       being, to me the part of the messiness of being human being is the complexity part of, part of the beauty of creativity, uh, for me is being fucked up a bit like the, you know, perfection would be a boring state

Speaker 3:          00:58:05       if you could create wormholes and travel to distant galaxies and all sorts of forms with zero emotion and just pure love because it's been created and silicone fucking plates and you could fly through the galaxy with no worry about not being able to breathe. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:58:21       My, I believe in my personal experience that without the troughs, the peaks and meaningless,

Speaker 3:          00:58:26       I believe that we should have stayed single celled organisms because all this fucking splitting. It's just been super complicated. If we were single celled organisms, we have no racism, we'd have no murder. Single celled organisms don't have gun rights. They, they, they don't fucking, they don't eat anything. So fucking boring job that boy, are we in comparison to these artificial life forms that can travel to different galaxies.

Speaker 4:          00:58:46       I mean, part of the beauty of Shakespeare and colleridge and shelly and like the great art that we've ever produced is the, is the fact that it touches something inside of us that is, that can be contrasted against the fucked up nurse of the rest of our, of the human condition. I think the human condition is an interesting thing with preserving maybe, or I like the West speaking as if we have the option not to. Like we will just kind of figuring out whether or not we should flip the switch on this. It's, we're still a long way from that switch. Well

Speaker 3:          00:59:16       think go back to when we were, uh, you know, 200,000 years ago when we were the weird monkey people, if someone along and said, hey, I know we haven't figured out language yet, but I'm gonna I'm just explained to you the idea of twitter, you know, fucking a monkey. You'd be like, no, no, no. Listen man, I've got to find food in my area. There's a beauty to starving is a, there's a meter running from leopards and climbing up trees to avoid predators. I mean, this is a beautiful thing to have a seven year lifespan if you're fucking lucky.

Speaker 4:          00:59:44       I mean, I guess it depends what we're talking about, about the fucked up most of the human condition. I would agree with you that if you could get rid of mental illness, if you could get rid of unnecessary, a self doubt and self criticism, then that would probably be a positive thing, but that wouldn't be left with purely positive emotions that I don't think he'd want to be. Who wants to be on an ecstasy trip their entire life?

Speaker 3:          01:00:04       Me, I'll take it. I'm not saying that it would be that even. I'm just saying that we, we, we live as if this idea of emotional struggle is a necessity to happiness and that happiness isn't a necessity to a meaningful life and what is a meaningful life if it is all just temporary. You know, life is finite and there's no. There's no arguing that right now at least. Well, what is meaning? What are all these things other than these, these quantities that we attach to our life, you know, I'm more happy now. I'm less happy when I do this. I'm more fulfilled when I do that. I mean all these things are a part of the biological reality that we live in and we equate the significance of our existence to these biological reality, but at the end of the day, we're just fucking and breeding and continuing to make new TV sets.

Speaker 3:          01:00:57       I mean, at the end of the day, when you look at the human race as a whole, this gigantic super organism that continues to make smaller cell phones and fucking faster cars. What? What exactly is the significance? What exactly is the meaning? If ultimately what we're doing is polluting the ocean and pulling out all the fish and damaging the atmosphere and changing the fucking the Gulf stream and all those nutty shit that we're a part of as a byproduct of all these emotions and desire from materialism and all these different things. If we can avoid all that, if we could live as solar powered creatures that are made a carbon fiber. Sure, sure it was, you know, we say no because we are this, but we can't stay this. We're not going to have 10 million years go by and we come back to 2014. We look how fucking goofy this argument is. These dumb motherfuckers wanted to stay people. No,

Speaker 4:          01:01:49       I, I, I take your point and I, but I think that, uh, I think the kernel of insight there that's, that's precious is the, is the fact that we've essentially got it ass backwards about how you find meaning and happiness, right? I don't think we necessarily. I think even as biological human beings, we can still do a hell of a lot better job than we currently do about contextualizing what happiness is like. It always frustrates me when people whine about not being happy. Happiness for me is a byproduct have made doing things that I'm good at and that contribute in some way. Right? Like, don't sit around like chasing. The more you chase happiness, it's like squeezing the soap in your hand too hard and it just slips right out. The more you specifically try to focus on chasing happiness, the less happy you are. Just get on with your life and do stuff that's good and happiness will just be a byproduct of that.

Speaker 3:          01:02:38       That's a very good point as a person and I think another thing that makes you happy is to be around happy people and to give each other things like as far as like friendship and love and companionship and and laughter and like you, you give and you know you experienced from each other and you know you bond together by yourself sucks. You know by yourself is okay in small doses, but find some of the most miserable, angry people and you find a lot of times those people have no love in their lives. Yeah, that's the big issue. Sean Hannity fucking shot love, but it's all from retards. He's got those nine volt batteries out there. We're going to close up our borders. Sean, once they invent jetpacks, all those borders are going to be fucking meaningless. People just gonna be flying through the air and you're gonna have to scoop Mexicans out of the sky with nets. Is nobody going to be able to stop them and then we're going to have to just assimilate and deal with the fact that we, you know, we're all sharing this planet together and this idea of borders is fucking preposterous. This idea that you were born in that patch of dirt so you don't have healthcare, but I'm born on this patch of dirt so I got fucking gun rights flow can freedom and American Eagle tattooed on my back.

Speaker 4:          01:03:46       Everyone's going to get a shit ton more rich though before we can get rid of borders. Do you think so? Yeah. Because otherwise, I mean, I'm not saying that that's a good thing. I'm just saying that that's a fact. A fact on the ground. If, if every Indian and Chinese person who was able to move to the United States, then a large proportion of them would. And then you kind of get you free healthcare because you afraid you can afford you a free healthcare. Not that America has free healthcare, but you know, you couldn't, you can't have. There's an old saying that you can either have a welfare state or you can have open borders, be kind of both,

Speaker 3:          01:04:15       or you can have utopia when we all become carbon based life forms that are made out of

Speaker 4:          01:04:19       lot of libertarians would say, just get rid of the welfare state and get rid of the borders and let every man sort of fend for himself. But I'm a big believer that the, one of the great humanizing, socializing forces of the 20th century was the development of the welfare state. That the new deal and the idea that we have a sort of societal obligation to take care of one another. I think it works well in a lot of countries, especially in Scandinavian countries with willow and Denmark and works well in Australia and New Zealand. Um, and open borders will put an end to that.

Speaker 3:          01:04:47       Well, I think there's a good thing that the welfare state does if it's attached to strong ideas and a strong philosophy of self improvement. The problem with the welfare state is that Unsung folks with given some backgrounds and given some behavior patterns that people have fallen into that it can lead to complacency.

Speaker 4:          01:05:07       Yeah. Let me just clarify what I mean by welfare state. That might be a slightly American term. Uh, I, I just mean providing unified universal healthcare for everyone, providing free tertiary education or discounted education and not burning

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       people with student loans, uh, taking care of old people to do globally. Um, certainly healthcare is expensive. Expensive in this country already spends like 14 or 17 percent of. It's an entire GDP on healthcare. What we would only need to double that or triple that to bankrupt it. And you would certainly do more than triple that. You're doing 100 fold if you will. You can do it 20 fold if you expanded it to the world because the United States is wildly one 20th of the world's population. Right. But if you take out the amount of money that we spend on military, the amount of money we sent it. I mean, if the whole world was assimilated and that sort of sense would still not still not close. No. I mean, mark, you know, we spend like a sixth of the GDP on healthcare. That's insane. It's so insane.

Speaker 1:          01:06:01       And, and, and we get outcomes in this country that are inferior to, to other countries that have socialized what we spend on military. I don't know how we should look that up because if we could spend. Oh, I'm, you know, obviously, you know, that's the argument. We don't need war. We need doctors and gun food. I mean, don't get me wrong, we spend way too much on the military way more than we need to. I mean, America spends more than the next. What is it, nine or 10 nations combined. Those nations are friendly nations. So who are you? Well, apart from depending on pay to find China, but you know what, uh, what is this for? It's a jobs if fucking jobs programs to keep everybody down. Flex, flex on motherfuckers, make sure nobody gets crazy. We have, that's why we have military bases and over a hundred different countries.

Speaker 1:          01:06:44       I mean, the real expense though is when I say it's a job program, literally every the lowliest have made sure that every state of America essentially has a vested interest in keeping their Faq, their munitions factory going like one state. It'll be they build nuclear submarines and another state. It'll be this instead of. Instead of having it concentrated, they very explicitly made a political case to make sure that all political constituencies across the country have a local vested interest in maintaining their mill, their little piece of the military industrial complex, which means we're producing know fighter jets that the Pentagon says they don't want. They don't need simply because the local representative will say, well, we're not going to cancel. Listen, you know, lose certain jobs in my district. Okay, well, if it's a jobs program, just let's admit that it's a jobs program and just say, okay, that's.

Speaker 1:          01:07:30       That is the way that we've chosen to deliver welfare in this country by giving people jobs in the, in the military that, that, that we don't need them to do. So in that case, what we really need to do is declare war on poverty. If we declare war on poverty, then we'll make money out of eliminating poverty. The same way we have the war on drugs. The war on drugs is essentially a war against. I mean it's, it's a job factory the same way. I mean it's a, it's a, it's a job hustle the same way military is, I mean the military. There's certain places where the military is a viable option for people that are in poor neighborhoods that need some form of income. Yeah, that's right. It's right. It's a constant and oftentimes, I mean if you're, if you're poor, especially if you're a minority then.

Speaker 1:          01:08:10       And so you kind of have the same opportunities that other people do. Yeah. The military is a great option. And another option would be to become a drug dealer. So the military is a good option. Yeah. Yeah. What the fuck? Right. I have to fix this josh steps. That's why I'm here. Joe. I don't think we're doing a goddamn thing. You and I think we're on. We're on the way, I think. I think we've got it. I think we've fixed about 30 percent of the world's problems so far today. I really don't think that this pace. I think we'll, I think we'll get it done a couple of years of this conversation. How often are you in La, man? We only have about 10 minutes left. Okay, got it. We got to do this again. Um, yeah. I'm, uh, I'm here. I'm in, I'm in and out sometimes.

Speaker 1:          01:08:49       I also want to plug a minute, my new venture, which is I'm doing alive, someone launching a live show in. I'm in New York in front of a live studio audience and we're going to podcast that. So I want people to like send an email to the show and get on our mailing list so that you can get free tickets and swag and all that sort of stuff. Uh, it's called we the people and it's like a panel show me like hosting with, uh, with, for guests and we talk about the news and the audience votes on whose opinion they liked the best. That's great. Uh, as we will be really fun. So go to send an email to info at we the people pod. You're going to pick the audience or you just gotTa let Sean Hannity fans come in showing that any fans fucking drooling and slipping all over the floor, you're going to let them in.

Speaker 1:          01:09:28       Welcome. Welcome everybody including defense. What about Sean Hannity? Would you have them on the show? No, no worries. Of course. I would realize that'd be. Wouldn't it be fascinating? Wouldn't be facing as long as you had a lot of time. Really get deep with them and break it down because a guy like that can keep up the fucking hustle and shuffle for like 20, 30 minutes. It would either be interesting or it wouldn't be interesting at all. You know? It was like I was talking to mark Marin in that interview on Friday about whether or not he'd want to interview a rush limbaugh on his show. And he was like, not really. He was like, I didn't think I'd ever get through the the charade. I've never really had a nice little bug or oxycontins on murder for you. Come on son. Let's shake it. Shake it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:09       Shake it, listen to this. Wouldn't it be amazing if you could get one of those guys on drugs and just take them down the rabbit hole and really get like you do Iowaska. Wouldn't rush limbal see what happens. Oh, a lot of crying. Lot of screaming. Fucking being pulled apart by a lot of vomiting, a lot of shooting just to load. There'd be a lot of lot of bodily fluids. It wouldn't be pretty. I take it back. I don't want that thought experiment would be willing to be around him shooting his. I could see all the other stuff. I mean I just think of a lot of these people that have been incredibly supportive of war and the military industrial complex. Just seeing the repercussions, the possible repercussions of that support in, in some sort of manifested in some sort of a spiritual form that would be very, very terrifying.

Speaker 1:          01:10:53       Advocate presence to the impact of. Of what their part of. I don't know. I mean the drugs that that guy is into the disassociative drugs. I mean, someone who's into like the oxys and someone who's into like something just like the narcotics that Zonk you out, but even not even a hannity like, uh, you know, I saw one thing that I'm pretty passionate is, is the, is the push to get rid of nuclear weapons, right? This is a perfectly achievable thing. It's something that Ronald Reagan was passionate about as well, so it's not a right wing or left wing thing. It's just a recognition that if we have thousands and thousands and thousands of nukes in the world at some point, eventually we're gonna use them. Someone's going to get them. Someone's, you know, we can't as they say in, in the nuclear security guy and you can be right.

Speaker 1:          01:11:38       90 nine point nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine percent of the time. And that instilled destroy the world when you've got thousands of nukes and social on Hannity saying like railing against this and saying you the white stop nuclear weapons is to have more nuclear weapons in the United States so that bad guys won't use them. And I'm like, what are you even like? Are you even close to being present to the impact of what you're saying, like it's so fucking wildly out of touch with any grand, a big attempt to to think beyond just the momentary immediate talking point in the most obvious reflexive knee jerk bullshit, like step back for a second and look at where you are in the world. Well, it's also not supported by the history of suicide bombings, right? The history of suicide bombings in this world is pretty fucking extensive.

Speaker 1:          01:12:27       There's a lot of people that have taken their own life and a bunch of other people's lives with them because they thought they were doing it for some holy purpose or some martyrdom or whatever. Someone can do that with a nuclear weapon and that is a reality of nuclear weapons. Absolutely. The real question though is, is it too late? Is can you take the salt out of the ocean? Is it possible to extract all the nuclear weapons and figure out a way to make some sort of a deal? At the moment, it does seem to be. I mean, well with the exception of North Korea, you could do. You could do a deal, I mean, I think, I think everyone could get on board and look if you want to have one, if you want to keep one nuclear weapon, then then do it. That is, what is this going up?

Speaker 1:          01:13:06       Defense Budgets from 2012 of all the different countries and then the US. Yeah. So you've got a bit. You've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine at the. So that's the next 10 countries and it's less than the US. Six hundred and 82 billion. And so looking at those countries, the only country there that say that's a of a rival really is Russia. China is a, I'm not worried about China and I think we'll uh, we'll, I think we'll have a peaceful coexistence with them. And then the UK, Japan, France, Saudi Arabia, I mean this shit holes, but uh, they're not going to use a tiny amount so small in comparison. It's hilarious ball. That's a shit textile with go. Yeah. It's, um, it's, it's a weird situation when you think about a thousand years from now, will we still have this whole, this whole mutually assured destruction thing hanging over our heads a thousand years from now. I can't see it. Will we have figured out a way past this? I think we have to. Well, isn't it all about the emotions and the greed and all the stuff that comes along being a biological life

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       form, isn't it all about all the stuff that comes from being this troubled monkey that's trying to assimilate with cell phones? And she asked him

Speaker 4:          01:14:21       ability to triumph over that. I mean, one of the most touching things this, this past weekend was the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. You don't want the great triumphs of, of human civilization is the fact that the 20th century, as nasty as it was, as brutal as it was, it didn't end in mutually assured destruction. These, these monkeys managed to rise above their, their worst selves and come to their better nature. And on several occasions came really, really close to destroying themselves like the Cuban missile crisis. And didn't good for us. Good for its pilot complexity. Pat Yourself on your back. Humankind. Yeah. Well we figured out when we watched Hiroshima and Nagasaki that this could be a fucking mess globally and somehow or another we managed to stumble to 2014 and kill a lot of fucking people, but not with nuclear weapons. That's right. You know, there was a single nuclear weapon. I think it's the tightened to which we have loads of either hundreds or thousands, which has the explosive power, more explosive power, much more explosive power. Then every single bomb dropped in World War II by all parties, including Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Speaker 3:          01:15:29       Whoa. That's on renamed my deck. Tightened to

Speaker 4:          01:15:35       rename. Know that they had all these other names called Titan one a column. And what is it? Enola Gay. The plane. I think that

Speaker 3:          01:15:49       it's nice to see that we haven't done that. It's nice to see that we haven't blowing each other up since 1945 or whatever it was. What was it? 40th five when we dropped the bombs. It's nice to see that. We have not done that since then, but it's such a small amount of time in perspective.

Speaker 4:          01:16:04       That's why we have to get rid of him, I think. I think we've. We've stumbled onto something that is far more advanced technologically than our emotional capability has to handle. It's like it's like you've been given. You've given a monkey the, you know the keys to a car, you just gotTa. You just gotTa take the keys back.

Speaker 3:          01:16:23       Well, it's also the people that have this are not the people that built it and created it and engineered it and understand it, and so the discipline involved in doing all those things in the accomplishment of creating it. The people that did create it were absolutely horrified at it being used. The oppenheimer quote, I don't know if you've ever seen it, but it's fucking terrifying. We can end on this. We like Oppenheimer quoting the Bhagavad Gita and seen that. I haven't seen it. I've read the quote. It's fucking amazing because you see the pain in this guys face like the als is the face of death or whatever that is. I am because I am damn death destroyer of worlds and he, he. Well, we'll play it and we'll, we'll end on this. Please tell people how they get ahold of your show and how they get ahold of you. So huff, post live,

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       you can just go to www dot huff post live. We ere seven or eight hours of original content every single day. You could probably see stuff posted in terms of clips all over the Huffington post or you can also go to having a post.com/live and the. So that's my main gig and then this, but subscribed to this live show and you'll get lots of cool swag and stuff because I'm going to podcast it and that is info at we the pod. We got another hour.com. My fucking clock.

Speaker 3:          01:17:40       Oh, we're good. Oh, let's play the Bhagavad Gita thing too, right? Cool. I was like, how did that go by two and a half hours. Go by so quick. It was one and a half hours. Okay. I'm fucking stupid. I can't say cold bear and I don't know about time. Change is. I have this little clock here and daylight savings. It's an old school, Clark Davidson, so let's play this Bhagavad Gita thing because it is good. I'm glad we do this because I love talking to you, man. Alright, five, four, three, two, one

Speaker 5:          01:18:18       in the dead. Silence of the morning at five, 29, 45 mountain war time. The Wester was bathed in an intense flash of light that man had only seen from the stars.

Speaker 3:          01:18:36       Just cut the fucking oppenheimer. Man. You know this drama bullshit. There it is. Okay. Here it goes.

Speaker 6:          01:18:44       The world would not be the same.

Speaker 3:          01:18:47       Look at his face, man.

Speaker 6:          01:18:49       Kill people. Shoot. People cried. Both people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita. No, trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty to impress him. Takes on multi armed form, says, now I am become death. The destroyer of worlds. I suppose we all put that on way or another.

Speaker 4:          01:19:37       Oh my God. Chills up my fucking. That's

Speaker 3:          01:19:40       fine. When you see his face and you realize that this is a scientist that essentially was given the task of creating this incredibly destructive device and if he didn't, if they didn't, then the enemy would have and they saw what was going on with Nazi Germany, the Third Reich was taking over Europe and killing everybody and what was going on in the Holocaust, and they just realized that we're in this unwinnable situation, someone to do something.

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       It's completely bombed, completely understandable. The scientists like to blame the scientists for doing it, and they were, as you can see, morally conflicted about it. Richard Fineman, one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century, worked on it and then campaign for the rest of his life for denuclearization and he died of cancer because he kept going to these nuclear testing zones and dumb and protesting. That's how firemen died. Oh No, hang on. That was Carl Sagan. Sagan died from cancer because of his anti nuclear protests, but fireman was also very conflicted about his role in in, in all of that. It's tricky. I mean, you had to do it at the time, but in hindsight, just imagine, I mean, think of a world where there is no nukes and it's just another like the idea of a single bomb wiping out an entire city. You used to have to fly sorties over Dresden, 24 slash seven, just raining bombs on something just to, you know, to destroy.

Speaker 4:          01:20:59       So you may one bomb killing thousands, hundreds of thousands of people potentially nowadays. Millions of people from one bomb one moment, one instant, and we got up to, you know, when we're in the height of the Cold War, we were producing hundreds of these, I think was hundreds a day at the peak. What was it? No, it was no, we were producing more than one an hour. It was like, yeah, we will produce. Will produce what we ended up with over 10. No, again, remember it's like in the tens of thousands of nukes that we had stockpiled. We've now brought that considerably down, but we still have thousands, thousands of nukes for everyone.

Speaker 3:          01:21:37       Many times over. We could kill everyone on earth many times over.

Speaker 4:          01:21:40       Totally. We could kill not only every one, but like everything we could blanket the planet.

Speaker 3:          01:21:46       Well, when you look back at history and the horrible things that human beings have done to each other without bombs, I mean if you look at the amount of like the Mongols regularly killed. I mean the estimation is between 20 and $50. Million people during Genghis Khan's life and they did that with horses, horseback and arrows and catapults and shit. And they killed cities with a million people. They wiped the entire city out. They did that with no weapons other than standard shit. Yeah. It was a lot more work. Not more work, but it's the idea behind it that's so terrifying that people can be so fucking brutal. And the idea that you give the same animals, this ability to do the same thing with a press of a button.

Speaker 4:          01:22:29       Yeah. It's the ease of it that is so kind of bone chilling about nukes. It's similar to people who, who are big guns, guns, rights defenders will. Uh, we're so lucky. The Hutus and Tutsis had each other to death with machetes. They didn't need guns. No. That's true, but it's just you have to really care about it more to kill someone with a machete than we've been by pulling a trigger. It's just a lot easier and that's, that's true. If nukes you have really you, you are able to achieve spontaneously with almost no effort, something that would otherwise take a tremendous amount of effort and forethought.

Speaker 3:          01:22:59       What scares me the most about the gun debate is not the concept of whether or not people should have checks whether or not people should have access to automatic weapons. It's the ignoring of the psychotropic drugs that people are on. It's the ignoring of human, illegal. One's legal. One's the ignoring of all the different instances of people either being on antidepressants, withdrawing from antidepressants, getting off their medication, and having unbelievably erratic behavior. The, if you ever looked at like the statistics for massive mass shootings and how many of those people were on psychotropic drugs are coming off of them or, or withdrawing from them. It's almost all of them.

Speaker 4:          01:23:43       Right? But there's a, there's a, um, there's an ambiguous causation chain there, right? That's right. Is it the drugs or is it because they're crazy and that's why they are taking the drugs?

Speaker 3:          01:23:52       It's a very good question and that's where, uh, I deviate from a lot of guns rights advocates. I don't think that we should have some sort of background checks or don't think we should have stability checks or the very least. How come you don't have to have a license? How come you have to take a test to drive a fucking car? Someone stands over you and looks at you and everybody knows. It's that weird feeling of being in the nervousness of being in the car with a driving instructor that's asking her a tester that's asking you a few questions and seeing if you stop perfectly at a stop sign and whether or not you look both ways before you make a turn, but you could just go buy a gun and no one has to look at you. No one has to ask you if you know how to fucking load that.

Speaker 4:          01:24:38       Honestly done understanding the gun debate in this, in this country. I don't. It does not even compute for me because, uh, I don't understand why the gun lobbies against all of that sort of stuff. Like I don't have, I'm not, I don't have a huge issue with people having firearms. I do basically think that that in dense urban areas, you should not be packing a gun unless you're like a unique one because you're a celebrity or something. Um, but I don't understand why the NRA thinks that background checks and licensing and stuff. Is, is a paranoid and they think that that's a slippery slope and that that's going to lead to guns being taken away in the future. Or is it actually those simple precautions that they, that they on principle objective, I can't figure it out because it doesn't make any sense to me. If you could massively reduce the number of people who are being slaughtered in this country constantly every day, why wouldn't you?

Speaker 3:          01:25:30       I think it's the slope thing. I really do. I think it's a slippery slope argument. I think that, uh, it's like we were talking about with a social justice warriors, you know, that there, there's the extreme reaction towards doing something that I believe is morally correct and, and fighting for objectified people are fighting for marginalized people. That this is in reaction to the racism or sexual exploitation and all the different things that have occurred on the other side of the spectrum. And this is what in, in, uh, in sort of an analogous way they're to do with gun control. What they're trying to do is fight off any form of possible gun control, fight off any background checks, fight off any waiting periods, holding periods, fight off magazine size restrictions or,

Speaker 4:          01:26:17       and yet like, like I was saying about, um, about the, the Sui pox of the world, the cancel Kobe is of the world. I'm losing potential allies in people like me. That just completely alienates me from the gun rights movement, right? Because if, if the, if the conversation was around, should it be legal or illegal for a person who is saying who is provably sane and who undergoes a test to make sure that they know how to, how to safely use a firearm and is responsible and can keep it locked up at, at home, should they be able to have a basic firearm, then you're not going to get a lot of dispute from almost anyone apart from the most extreme people on the anti gun sight and there are very few people like that. So you alienate, you lose an ally, you lose a potential ally and someone like me by being so rabidly against what I regard as being simple precautions for the responsible use of something that could kill people.

Speaker 3:          01:27:09       I, I agree with you, but I think that this is what we're dealing with. We're dealing with. There are, there are many groups that, I mean there was a famous obama quote where he was talking about how people are just resistant. They don't just, you know, whatever. Whatever it is, they don't want us to come and take their guns and these people were furious that Obama would think that he has the right to come and take their guns. Like who are you as a person to tell another person they cannot have this gun and there's a lot of people that fucking love guns in this country. I have friends that are gun nuts. My friend Justin is a fucking gun nut everyday that dudes at the range shooting targets like a 900 yard distance and fucking pinging metal and you know, it's like bang. Think because you shooting that fucking far away.

Speaker 3:          01:27:54       Like you can actually hear it after the gunshot goes off. I think that's fun. Good fat. He's got a hobby. Okay. No one's known. Taken his guns. He, it's there in the constitution amendment to the constitution. The. Whereas about things changing, we'll think about the privacy amendments. I mean think about what's, what's happening right now with the NSA. This is unconstitutional. What's happening that didn't do any good anyway, what they're doing as far as like spying on everyone cell phone, being able to record. Everyone's messaged as data center that did developing in Utah is going because the supreme court is stacked with a very tough types of people who gun nuts vote for. That's true, but they're worried that the Thai could shift with a president like Obama was somewhat.

Speaker 4:          01:28:34       Yes. If you had a rabidly left wings, if you had a supreme court that was eventually as rapidly lift wing as the current supreme court is right wing, then it's conceivable of course that you could just rip up a portion of the constitution and ignore it and reinterpret it some way. Worried

Speaker 3:          01:28:50       about it. I mean if you see this far fetched, it's so far down the road, I would think it's so far fetched that they'll be able to record. When Alex Jones, who's a friend of mine who's arguably very crazy, but he used to tell me, Joe Rogan, they're going to take every single phone call that everyone makes cross the country. They're going to record it in a database and you're going to have everything you've ever said. If you ever get in trouble, they pull you over for some reason. Some guy wants to fuck your wife, wants to put you in jail. They're going to go to your [inaudible] database and pull something out and taken out of context and lock you up in a cage and I would go to. This guy's so fucking out of his mind, but then you look at what's going on today. When this Edward snowden revelations came out that literally they can go to your email, the employees. It's not just metadata, all this horseshit that Obama said, it's not true. The employees can go to your email and record and take anything they would like. That is unbelievable.

Speaker 4:          01:29:43       It's an absolute outrage that this is the. This is the show in which I'm most furious at Obama along with like hounding whistleblowers and leakers and prosecuting these, these people. But I mean in terms of, you know, Alex Jones being right on that. Y'All a stopped clock is right twice a day as well. You know, just because someone gets something coming from Josh, that doesn't mean that you can get to the rest of charge. That's a good. Alex Jones. Thank you very much. He's my friend. Um, you know, uh, I think there are, if we have to, it's useful to sort of allocate our concern to the fields that most deserve it. And at the moment the big concern for people who like freedom is. No, I don't, I just don't think that's a big concern.

Speaker 3:          01:30:32       That's not my concern. This is not going to happen. Take umbrage and issue with something you said earlier about someone living in a city not being able to have a gun. Why? Why not? I mean, isn't that like one of the most. If you live in densely populated area, the possibility of you being robbed is much higher. You know, if you live in certain areas like Detroit or Chicago where I think guns should be a way of resolving disputes between individuals even. That's true. What about defending yourself?

Speaker 4:          01:31:00       It'll take it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:31:01       Be able to use someone breaks into your house and they have a gun and they're looking to kill your family. You don't think you should be able to defend yourself.

Speaker 4:          01:31:06       Uh, you should be able to defend yourself. The, the flip side of that is that if everyone is, um, you end up with,

Speaker 3:          01:31:13       with far more violent cities, then if everyone. Isn't it so true, sir? Look at the statistics of the society is a polite society. I have this assistant in, in defense against this concept. Chicago has one of the strictest gun control laws in the country. Everyone has the highest level. It's a good example. That's why, because it also has an extremely high level of gun violence because you're not going to ever get the criminals to stop using guns because they're illegal because they're doing illegal shit. Anyway.

Speaker 4:          01:31:42       One of the things which were I agree with with you on that is that there are so many guns in the states already. We're like, we're so. We're so far the horse has bolted so far that that closing the gate now is kind of pointless. There are more guns in there. Are People out there? Yes. So my house are. I do think that that, that's the explanation for why places like Chicago is so violent because you see, I mean, what is the point in putting in a gum, a strict gun law now everyone's already got guns.

Speaker 3:          01:32:09       Well actually in defense of the reality of the Chicago situation is it has to do with organized crime Chicago. Um, it has to do with the war on drugs and it has to do with gangs being control of drug dealing. What happened in Chicago, they, they sort of destabilize the environment by locking up key gang members. I have a friend in Chicago cop and he explained the whole situation to me what an unbelievable clusterfuck it became when they locked up certain they, they, they went on these rates, locked up certain gang members and drug leaders, drug drug gang leaders. And when they did that, a power struggle ensued. And then it's sort of like what's going on in Mexico. It's like once you, once you have this power, this power struggle, you have this vacuum. People try to fill the position and there's just unbelievable violence.

Speaker 3:          01:32:57       I mean, he was describing to me things that they find on a daily basis, the amount of murder that they, that they encounter in Chicago. And it was, it's not just disheartening, but I was like, why do you stay last days? Like, Hey, this is my job, is what I do. Uh, you know, I'm not happy about it, but uh, it's, uh, I, I hope we can get a handle on it eventually. But he, but he was outlining all the different issues with it. He's like, this has nothing to do with gun control. He goes, if you, you change the laws, you would have the exact same results. This has to do with profit, nasty with drugs and that's due at the war on drugs. Yep. It has to do with the fact that these people can make insane amounts of money and then they have this insane resources. Exactly, exactly what we're seeing in Mexico.

Speaker 4:          01:33:36       Mexico. Mexico is one of the great tragedies of the world at the moment. Also, it also provides a good counter if you want to be more original next time, then use Mexico as the gun them because they actually have really strict gun laws to look at how a wash with gun violence there. So I take that. I take that point. I take that critique. I think in. I think in other societies I was a big. I was a big fan of the fact that Australia, after it had its last mass massacre mass shooting in the late nineties, a conservative prime minister took on the gun lobby and basically outlawed guns, did a gun buy back with the government, paid to collect guns and there's a huge amount of misinformation on the web about the consequences of that. Buy a gun rights folks, 100 people and the whole continent.

Speaker 4:          01:34:16       That's kind of my point is not going to work. It's kind of my point a. and you didn't have this preexisting gun culture, real movies. That's right. It's, you know, a lot of Americans who don't, who haven't been to Australia, kind of assume that Australia is real rugged outdoors. He kind of a wild outback Steva when Crocodile Hunter Crocodile Dundee. In reality, we're a bunch of pussies where we all live on the coasts in, in several big cities, you know, like three cities have almost half of the entire population of the country and we all sit around going sailing and drinking chardonnay and drinking and sipping lattes. So we didn't really need it.

Speaker 3:          01:34:49       Guns I fucking love. Sydney is one of the time. I've only been there. This is the only place I've ever been in Australia, but I'd fucking move there in a heartbeat is shit. Hit the fan. If somebody decided to blow up America or if yellowstone exploded and needed a place to live, I fucking moved to Sydney and a God damn heartbeat.

Speaker 4:          01:35:05       Hard to think of another city that has just just in terms of the sheer day to day standard of living as, as nice as pleasant place to be. You know, the sunshine, the hub of the food, the friendly people, everything. The Asian communities, the Middle Eastern communities.

Speaker 3:          01:35:18       The problem is you guys drive on the wrong side of the road to switch over. I'll move. Well, Americans are like, listen, we invented the fucking car. Why are you guys driving on the wrong side of the Goddamn Road? You know what that is? Yes. I tell me, remind me swords. It's an ancient ancient thing from England and that when you would pass on, the horses were passing the road. If you were fighting in combat, you would fight with your right hand. So most people are right handed. That's the hand you would carry your sword, so you really want to be on the left side, so that way if someone was on your right side, you can hack at them. If you are on the right side and someone's over on your left side and you have a sword, it's fucking very difficult to reach across the horse or you'd have to hack on

Speaker 4:          01:35:58       do with there being two horses on put to pulling coaches. I mean, I think you're right, but why? But that doesn't explain why it was different here in the states. Why will people already using wholesome cots on the righthand side here? They also use a right handed

Speaker 3:          01:36:12       because when we were. By the time we got to America, by the time European travelers came to America, we were already like, fuck England, fuck your up. We're going to do shit our way over here. Let's just go on the other side of the road and then we invented cars and so we like, we don't have guns. They're like, it doesn't matter. I'd rather be further away from the fucking guy shooting. I'll fucking go on the right side. I read

Speaker 4:          01:36:34       that. In addition to that, there was. They will wider roads here so you would have two horses side by side or like for horses or something. Pulling Lodge at cots than you than they had back in England and that it had something to do with being in the right position to whip the horses. So you didn't have to cross over your body to with the whip.

Speaker 3:          01:36:52       [inaudible] could be. Who knows? I don't know. I'm talking out of my ass clearly. Yeah, me too. But I would. I talked to my friends in England. They were explaining to me that it was actually literally went back to the time of sword fighting, that you would be on the lefthand side that I just don't buy. Why Americans would have changed because we're better when you're smarter. We have guns, we have jets, we go to the moon. This is a lot, lot better here. It's a lot better. This is why people don't love me or America. Both. Yeah. I don't mean it folks. Relax. Everybody please. There was a thing that. It is interesting though, isn't it?

Speaker 4:          01:37:31       How different different cultures kind of conceive of or different nationalities conceive of themselves.

Speaker 3:          01:37:36       More Koreans are very proud and uh, the North Koreans particularly nationalistic, so much so that you know, it's a crazy basket case of a dictatorship and it's the best example of the bullshit that America tries to shove down everyone's throats about protecting people from bad people like Jesus Christ. If we're really worried about protecting people, is that what really why we're in Afghanistan because we want to protect those folks. Why the fuck have we not invaded North Korea chartwells to logistics about China nuclear weapons and the proximity to South Korea who are allies and all this blah, blah blah, but there's not even a discussion about mitigating the situation. There's zero discussion. No. Why? No natural resources. It's so fucking poor. They have to keep the lights off it.

Speaker 4:          01:38:22       They're not even strategically important in any way. Like the. They're basically a vessel of China and that didn't matter to us. I just it

Speaker 3:          01:38:30       back from Canada. I was gone for a week. I was offline essentially for a week. Pretty much. Did fucking Dennis Rodman get Kenneth Bay released?

Speaker 4:          01:38:38       He thinks he said he did. He wrote a letter right after you got back from one trip there. And he's claiming that I have not seen that reported. That was the uh. So he's reporting well, he does have a relationship with Kim Jong. Ooh. What's that all about? Dude loves basketball. It's fucking great thing. No, I understand why he wants to be, you know, hub. And with Dennis, what's enough? Dentists?

Speaker 3:          01:39:01       Dennis is broke as fuck. I mean, you think about what is not in it for dentists. What does Dennis have going on? Man?

Speaker 4:          01:39:08       It's not about. I'm not baffled by like, uh, why he does it. I'm baffled that he's so bought into that. He seemingly so bought into the propaganda of that regime. He's, he keeps, he has this stupid moral equivalency. This is something that also frustrates me when people are like, oh, because of the U. S does bad stuff. That basically means that we're not in a position to criticize anybody else because you say that. Yeah. He's like, Hey, robin says he helped secure. Kenneth pays really well. It's nice and Kenneth Bay got released. He's like, I've heard him say, look, Kim Jong Kim gentlemen, you know, we here we're hear all this propaganda about what a bad guy he is. But Hey, you know, Clinton Clinton screwed Lewinsky. So you know, stuff happens. Bad stuff happens here as well. That's like the dumbest fucking. Not exactly parallel dude. I think that

Speaker 3:          01:39:51       what he's probably doing is trying in some way to. If he goes over there on a regular basis, he has to play politics. He has to, he has to say something positive about it. I mean he has to, he says negative things is going to get back to that.

Speaker 4:          01:40:05       I just don't think. He doesn't strike me as a very smart guy.

Speaker 3:          01:40:07       He's definitely not that. I mean, do you ever see him on celebrity rehab with Dr. drew knew he was terrible. It was awful. I mean, he's not a bright guy and it's, you know, he's, he's also in a weird situation where he doesn't have a whole lot of job options. I was at the k one k one is um, it's one of the biggest kickboxing organizations in the world and they had a big mixed martial arts event in Los Angeles many, many years ago was the, not many, many, but it was the debut of Brock Lesnar in mixed martial arts and Dennis Rodman for whatever reason, got hired by k one to be there and like pump it up. And like it was very strange. It was very Japanese because Japanese, they're there. They have their big fans of pageantry at these events. And the events are often filled with like huge, like gigantic crowds and big, big walkthroughs and big productions and explosions and fire and like, so Dennis Rodman is like standing at the top of this things, you know, and he gave the speech and it was just so dumb and awkward and he was saying fuck the UFC k one is here and all these different crazy shit.

Speaker 3:          01:41:10       But my point is like he doesn't have a lot of money. Like he has to do things like this. He doesn't have a lot of options.

Speaker 4:          01:41:15       So then just don't talk about it. I will stop or something. It just frustrates me when, when stupid people talk about shit that unless that. And it's usually, it's so fast, it's so easy and fashionable also to be like anti American and to be anti. Yes, America's foreign policy is a basket case. America has done a lot of shitty stuff but you know, you get this also with conversations around Islam and you know, I know you've spoken to Sam Harris and stuff about this, about the, the oldest old things are not equal. I just interviewed an Iraqi human rights campaigner who, who has come to the US as refugee. He's in his early twenties. He grew up under Saddam Hussein. He, he grew up during the American occupation and he is. He'll basically frustratedly saying, stop saying that there isn't a problem in Islam and stop saying that the US is, is to blame for everything that's going on in the region. We have our own problems and by and when leftwing people think that they're doing the right thing by being old fashioned, oblique kind of anti American. You're not siding with the people who actually need help over there. You're not siding with the secularists over there and the and the people who care about human rights.

Speaker 3:          01:42:20       There's also this weird thing, and this goes back to the social justice warrior thing, where people are allowed to criticize Christianity openly, but if you criticize Islam, you become Islamophobic.

Speaker 4:          01:42:34       Oh Shit. That's such an overused term. It is. Which is not to say that there aren't Islamophobes like the preacher who wanted to burn the Koran.

Speaker 3:          01:42:41       Well, there's, there's, there's people are phobic in many, many ways. You know, there's Christian have hopes, you know, you want to look at it that way. I've had Christians on my podcast that I deeply enjoy rupert sheldrake, who's a scientist who's also a Christian, but his version of Christianity is more of a philosophy and it's like psychedelically based. Then I mean it was very, very interesting guy and openly Christian and he derives or he. He gets a lot of comfort from that and I know he does it in a very, very intelligent and well thought out way and it's. It's an interesting point to discuss with a guy like that, but this Islamophobic thing like this idea that if you criticize like Sam Harris has been accused of it on a multiple times, it's just Islamophobia. His Islamophobic stance. Listen, all religions are fucking terrible. All of them. They're terrible. They're terrible for I. ideologies are bad for thinking they are bad because they lock you into a strategy or they lock you into a pattern rather. And if you, you aspire to be divine inside that ideology, especially in ancient one, it's extremely difficult to think outside the box.

Speaker 4:          01:43:57       Well, they are the oldest and most original incarnation of what I was talking about at the beginning of the, of the show, which is thinking in terms of labels and preset, uh, you know, things that you can just pull out of a box and take with you rather than actually communicating or thinking originally or being authentic. Right. I mean, you know, the, the tribes that we belong to an hour be they, the pro gay tribe or the suit or the cancel Kobe tribe or any of those things are really just new small cultural versions of the old biggest tribes which are religion. It's religion is just the easy preset way for people to inherit assumptions about the meaning of life and the history of the world without having to do any intellectual lifting of their own.

Speaker 3:          01:44:38       I also think it's, when you look at religions, I'm absolutely fascinated by religious and I find them amazing and one of the things that I find amazing about them just from a historical historical perspective of thinking about people that lived in a time where there were no answers. I mean, it is really truly amazing. We started coming up with mouth noises to indicate where to go and what to do and what foods to eat and what's known and what's yes, and then slowly but surely after fucking eons of staring at the stars and seeing people die and experiencing loss, they tried to find meaning to it all and they slowly but surely created these, these fables and these parables and these things that eventually were written down and translated from language to language. I find it absolutely fascinating when you look at it from a historical perspective of this, this being this organism trying to understand its place in the cosmos and that's what I think is beautiful about religion. I think from a historical perspective, it's beautiful. The problematic aspects of it when you try to apply it in 2014 with all the goddamn information that we know, and I didn't mean to say God damn, but I said it because it's appropriate accidentally. The information that we have now that refutes virtually everything. That's right.

Speaker 4:          01:45:55       I mean he's. Look what you say is very nice and poetic about the historical origins of religion, but as soon as the enlightenment came along, as soon as the scientific method was developed, as soon, certainly by the time Charles Darwin provided an explanation with how naturalistic processes could give rise to intelligent life, you don't need those original myths anymore. I mean we should long ago have been able to dispense with them and the fact that we're, we're unable to talk openly and frankly about how concerned we are to be about people who take their religions literally is a problem. It's a huge problem. And I also. I also have a problem. I agree with Sam Harris also in the point that you know, moderate. You say you, you, you, you enjoy talking about Christianity with this Christian who you had on. I do have a problem with people who give cover essentially to religious extremists by presenting religion as if it can be my reasonable thing because to the extent that moderate or moderate Muslims are moderate is the extent to which they don't really follow the letter of their faith. Right? And then you have to reinterpret and kind of squint and peer at your holy book through a particular prism, and then do a lot of juggling and reinterpreting in order to come out with a conclusion that is kind of morally tenable in 2014 to secular people. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:47:09       That is extremely important point. Right? And that's, that's a big issue when it comes to the leaving of the Islamic tradition. If you leave, you're supposed to be killed the fastest. Yeah. Apostasy in Islam is punishable by death. Homosexuality is punishable by death. Um, I watched a fucking horrible video last week, absolutely horrible of a woman who was accused of adultery and she was stoned to death. And this was, uh, this was all carried out by these isis guys apparently. Supposedly, you know, whether or not that's true. I don't know. I just watched this video and it's being translated. But this woman, she tried to apologize to her father. Her father wouldn't even touch his hair. Touch her hand. He wouldn't shake her hand. He says, you're not my daughter anymore. And then he threw the first rock. It was fucking horrible. And that is all done under the guise of religion, all of it.

Speaker 4:          01:47:59       And you constantly hear apologists like Reza Aslan is an obvious example saying, look, this is a gross or Ben Affleck on Bill Maher's show. This is a gross Caribbean.

Speaker 3:          01:48:08       Ben Affleck, he's gonna fuck up Batman. I know that son of a bitch. We need a jihad. I don't mean that. Come on, you're a good guy.

Speaker 4:          01:48:18       Uh, the refrain is always, this is a generalization. Most Muslims are good people and that is absolutely true. The vast, vast, vast majority of Muslims are good people and just like you and me. But the, the kind of the software that they're running on is problematic. And this rocky and human rights activist I was talking to was saying, look, one thing that raises Aslan will always say is like, what about Indonesia? For example? Indonesia is the most populous Muslim country in the world. Apologists for Islam, uh, constantly pointing at it and saying it's, it's fairly progressive. It's had a female leader, you know, it's democratic. It's not. This is not Saudi Arabia, you know, to to think that all of Islam is about not letting, not letting women drive is a misrepresentation of the way that most Muslims live, but you would hardly say that a country like Indonesia or even Jordan or any one of the other sort of good Muslim countries is particularly progressive by the standards that we should expect as liberals as smaller. I don't mean in the political sense within the United States, but as people who believe in freedom, yes, that you know he. This is rocky was saying, this is the. This is the bigotry of low expectations that if someone in the United States were to say the things about women and gays that are routinely said, even in Indonesia and the most moderate Muslim countries, liberals would be absolutely outraged. Why are we holding them to such a different standard? It's very good. Very

Speaker 3:          01:49:46       good point, and I that one of the resist the resistance. One of the big points of resistance when people in these countries get upset at people criticizing religion is you're essentially criticizing their way of life and their culture and it's tied in together and that this is almost an extra bowl from their, their, their daily existence that Islam, whether or not they believe in death for adultery or homosexual or any of the things that we find completely offensive. What you're saying by criticizing their religion is you're criticizing their very way of life. That's right, and that's what you're dealing with when you're dealing with these fundamental, these fundamentalist societies

Speaker 4:          01:50:24       and not even fundamental societies. I mean I can understand that if, if all of your being and your culture and your family and your community are woven up in a certain set of traditions, even if that's just, you know, a, a Catholic Catholicism because you grew up in a suburb of Boston and you know that's the way you do things and then someone confronts you and says that that is just a tissue of fabrications and lies that have been handed down for generations and it's wholly worthless. That's going to be an affront to to, you know, I mean it's not because it's not an, we're not intellectual beings. We can't like unpack and disentangle the sort of factual claims of our faith from the lived experience of being a human being who lives in a community and goes to church and has a nice posture and all of that sort of stuff. We have to find a way to do that though. Like we have to find a way to disentangle when people do identity from our, from the intellectual claims of religion.

Speaker 3:          01:51:18       Yeah. It's a lot of people do it very slowly. They do it over the course of their lives. Like I have some friends that, um, when I met them probably a decade ago, they were pretty hardcore Mormons. They're really nice folks and they're friends with my wife first and then we'd go to dinner with them and then we'd have these bizarre fucking conversations. Like you don't believe in a higher power I go to. It's not that I don't believe, I just don't see any evidence. Like show me some evidence of a higher power. And then I'll say, well, that makes a lot of sense, but it she's like, well, I wouldn't be able to live with. I wouldn't be able to get up every day if I didn't think that something's going to happen after I die. I go, don't you enjoy going out to dinner? We're out at dinner.

Speaker 3:          01:51:54       We had a nice dinner at a nice restaurant. We're having fun having a glass of wine. You are enjoying this. Like why does this have to lead to some magic fairy land where people have wings? Why does that have to, why can't you just enjoy this life? Well, I don't know. I don't know what happens when I die. I mean, if I didn't know what happens when I die, I wouldn't be able to go on. I'm like, well, that's pretty ridiculous. That's pretty ridiculous. But for a lot of people it becomes, um, scaffolding for your thoughts, scaffolding for your emotions. Like you have this structure that allows you to get by. It allows you to get through every day. And if someone pulls that structure and you're forced to sort of create a structure on your own, it's extremely problematic and these people that I'm friends with, they abandoned their church and they abandoned their church and now they're in this very weird limbo place where it's fairly interesting because they're very insightful.

Speaker 3:          01:52:47       And the woman we had this weird conversation which she was talking about how she feels like she's very open to being scammed because she's so trusting because she grew up in a fundamentalist mormon background and that she's just so open to suggestion because she was buying into horseshit her whole life and she, she just didn't question and this becomes sort of a pattern of thinking and it's, it's hard for people to just all of a sudden reestablish their, their ideology would establish their position and religion is an excellent scaffolding for sort of establishing your, your place in the world.

Speaker 4:          01:53:22       Yeah. And it's very comforting to have a sense of authority of as well, right? I mean there's something like being, having, having a loving. Yes. Having the creator of the universe like personally taken interest in your wellbeing must be an incredible sort of ego boost and Monday incredible security blanket. I mean, there's a reason why religions strokes us in certain ways that 98 percent of the world is religious. You know, it, it, it provides, it must provide some kind of sanctuary that's hard to, to, to shake off.

Speaker 3:          01:53:51       I think it's an enlightenment bridge. I think it's a, it's almost like a, a construct that we've created to sort of get our way out of the monkey body to get our way through to some next stage and as we're rejecting it now, pretty much for the first time in human history, it's culturally acceptable to reject it and it's almost more prevalent amongst youth than it is to accept it. If you talk to people in the, you know, the early 19 hundreds about rejecting God and atheism, but you would get a small percentage of highly educated people that would accept that idea. Whereas if you go to universities today and you promote atheism, you're gonna get a massive following. Yeah. There's a massive amount of people that are with you on this. I'm, I'm not even following Shinsei following a massive amount of people in agreement with you on these concepts that they. Yeah, we are dealing with a new era when new era of understanding and for a lot of people that's absolutely terrifying.

Speaker 4:          01:54:43       Yeah. It's less terrifying to me than the possibility of people, of people with religious delusions getting access to weapons of mass destruction, which is why I keep fighting, fighting the atheist fight. I think this is. This has the potential to be absolutely calamitous and whatever we can do to to minimize religious thinking and basically just hold people to account for what they claim to believe. I mean if, if, if you were interviewing someone for a job and you were considering hiring them and they started talking about how Elvis is still alive and he communicates with them through by leaving messages in their toast or something, I when you would just immediately disqualify that person from you, you would think, this is a crazy person. It would be nice to me if you similarly judged people who claim that the creator of the universe speaks to them on a daily basis and listening to what they say and listen to their prayers and, and intervenes in worldly affairs to cause, make natural disasters like destroy their neighbor's house but not their house.

Speaker 4:          01:55:41       I mean like for so many things on your mental arrogance. Like I saw her on the TV, there was like a, you know, a wildfire that went through an Australian suburb and the lady standing there in front of her house, she's like, ah, you know, God saved my house. Like what? God hated good neighbors so much. He wanted to burn down their house. That's a pretty fucked up thing for God to do. Like just to judge people on these beliefs the same way we would judge them if you, if they weren't religious beliefs, if they were equally silly but, but not protected by the fact that they, they, they fold into a formal role.

Speaker 3:          01:56:15       Well, the legacy thought patterns or thought patterns that existed before the Internet. And I think that the Internet is the new religion in the sense that it's not a religion, but it's a, it's a way to establish cultures and communities. It's a way to exchange information. It's a way to to live and think that never existed before when you were alone, when you were by yourself, when you were in these small tribes and all you had with this stupid old book of nonsense stories about, you know, the original two people that existed in fucking earth being created in seven days by an old man who lives in the clouds. That was all you had saw your hat and we have so much more now. And the, the, the landscape that you're surveying is so much larger. The landscape of information is just not just, it's almost inconceivably larger and inconceivably larger than when I was a boy.

Speaker 3:          01:57:04       I mean I, I was, I went to Catholic school for only one year and I was very fortunate that I didn't have very religious parents and they just sent me to Catholic school because it was a good option. I mean everyone was sort of religion, religious, but only casually, but it was so bad that I abandoned all my ideas of religion and I can really clearly remember this because it was an important part of my life because my parents had broken up when I was five years old and I was really insecure and scared and I just. My Dad wasn't around anymore. I was with my mom and I was, for whatever reason, I was seeking some sort of comfort in religion, what God says you should do this and God says, I don't even know who the fuck I heard it from, but I went to one year of Catholic school and these people were so horrible that I abandoned everything. I had given it all up by the time. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:57:54       They're the, they're the cancel, Colbert religion they could have. Had you had. You just been a little sweeter.

Speaker 3:          01:57:59       I so I understand it. Even though I was only five years old, I can remember it. I mean, I remember in vague sort of snapshots and some weird, weird images in our mind and we are concepts that I've sort of like held onto.

Speaker 4:          01:58:12       I've never experienced it. I've never, I've never. It's a, it's a, an aspect of human, human kind and human civilization and human psychology that is totally opaque and ineffable to me. I'd done, I'd done it under. I can't quite understand how. I'm almost one of the very, very few people in the world who doesn't have that Jane Breed, I guess I've me to a computer.

Speaker 3:          01:58:38       Well you're one of the very few people in the world, but I think the children that are growing up today, kids that are born

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       in 2014, there's going to be a less and less of that it's going to be. And also I should carve out here. There are certain civilized societies. And again, I use the word civilized advisedly, not to, not to shit on, you know, developing countries, but there are educated rich countries where the populations have basically gotten rid of religion altogether. Really? Cultures in Denmark. Um, I mean Australia and New Zealand, a pretty secular, like paypal will normal nominally tick Catholic on a, on a box, but when you actually stopped to ask them whether or not they believe any of the tenants, you've got 60 or 70 percent of the population who never go to church and don't think of themselves as being, as being religious. We'll look about gluggy Canada, less religious than America. America is less religious than Mexico, right? America is the most religious rich country, and that's all by the Reagan administration.

Speaker 1:          01:59:33       Those cocksuckers. Why? Because they courted it. They courted the, the, the, the rat model of Christian religious people from the 19 eighties were courted by the Reagan administration because they recognize them as being a source of. If you could get those people on your side, you had a guaranteed base. That's where they get their political clout from. But it goes back a long way in American history, the strain of puritanical evangelic event, evangelical protestantism, uh, in Australia, we have a saying that whenever there's a moral outrage and America and America gets it's tits in a tangle about, you know, Janet Jackson's Boob or something, we say, thank God we were founded by criminals and. No, but it's true though. I mean Australia has legalized prostitution. Yeah. Australia has a lot of things that America doesn't have in that sense. And I think the, the, the foundation, the original echoes of ignorance that started this whole thing off.

Speaker 1:          02:00:25       They still reverberate in 2014 and I was really ridiculous ideas about sex in this country. Oh God. Don't even get me started. It's crazy. I'm trying to get you started. It is. That's why we're here. The dysfunction that religion puts into people's sex lives, I think is just. Well for a start, it's criminal because it leads to so much suffering, especially in the gay community. I mean, you know, the, the level of teens, teenage suicide among Quia kids in religious areas is shocking. Is a national disgrace that we should be doing a lot more about and we should be much more vocal about not tolerating, you know, preachers preaching of hate, the preaching of hate and also this idea that it's a choice. That's maddening to me. What always makes me feel like I was reading a, an opinion by Scalia about this and it almost sounded like these people are bisexual because if he believes it's a choice, he's implying that he could choose to blow a guy. Well, he couldn't choose to blow a guy. Yeah. Why not? He could. I mean, if he's just like, fuck man. Bowie apparently slept together. If you want to believe. Yeah. I'm fucking shocked at ex wife. Lot of crazy stuff was going on. It was the seventies. I get they got nutty, but I think it is a

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       choice. But here's my point. So what if you're a straight person that you choose to do gay shit? What? Who Cares? Why does anyone care? And if you will, why would anyone say that? It must be a choice. How could you possibly know what someone wants to or doesn't want to do, what they feel inside,

Speaker 4:          02:01:57       and even if it were a choice, let's assume for the sake of argument that everyone is like perfectly bisexual. It's an absurd argument, but this is kind of what they're saying, what they're implying. If they're saying that it's totally a choice, then you don't give up your civil rights just because you belong to the community you belong to as a choice. Religion is a choice, but it's still protected. You still have the right to worship in whatever faith you want. The fact that I can choose to be a question or choose to be a Muslim doesn't deprive me of my right to exercise the to the free exercise of religion. Similarly, the my choice to be married to a man should not even if even if it is completely a choice, the way that I'm hardwired sexually and emotionally should not deprive me of my civil rights.

Speaker 3:          02:02:37       Absolutely, and that's one of the most offensive ideas in when it comes to this country where there's an argument against same sex marriages and it's still a fucking hot point topic of debate in 2014. How many states are where our same sex marriage too? I think that's fucking crazy. That is crazy. Vatican propose a dramatic shift in attitude towards gays. Same sex couple. This new pope. I'm not into the pope man, but this new new pope is a fucking and interesting is a goodie. He sits on a regular chair. He doesn't ride around the pope. Tmobile. I mean they got rid of that evil fucker and they went a 180 degrees. The other director.

Speaker 4:          02:03:13       Yeah, he's causing. I mean he's a, he's ruffling a lot of feathers in the conservative, you know there are a lot of people behind the pope who are conservative cardinals who are not happy campers at all. He represents a much more frankly, Latin American strain of religion, which is a much, much less crazy, much more loving, kind of communal interpretation of Catholicism.

Speaker 3:          02:03:33       So there's 18 different states. You said 35.

Speaker 4:          02:03:36       I think I'm right. Can we google it? I think that. I think that um,

Speaker 3:          02:03:42       that's fucking incredible. That's incredible that there's still laws. It might actually be the other way round. It might be 32. You can't get ready and I don't know. We'll find out soon enough, but the fact that there's that many states where it's 32 states have legal same sex marriage. That's fucking crazy.

Speaker 4:          02:03:57       I mean frankly I'm given like, it's like you were saying about the, the moral evolution of racism though, like from when you were growing up, born in 1967, that that half century there has just been a massive, massive period of advance. And it is true. I mean you've got to give people time. I do. I am impressed that 32 states now you can get married, same sex couples can get married and because just 10 years ago, let alone 20 years ago it was kind of inconceivable.

Speaker 3:          02:04:24       Well, this is why I'm not impressed because there's no logical reason other than

Speaker 4:          02:04:29       religion, but there never is. It's never logical. There's not a logical reason for racism. There's not a logical reason for homophobia. There's no logical reason to cancel a call back. I mean people

Speaker 3:          02:04:37       in a completely free society. There should be no reason to restrict people because you don't like it. There should be no reason why anyone should be able to say you can't get married to a man because I don't like it.

Speaker 4:          02:04:47       I hope that that sentiment is becoming, and I think it is becoming more and more prevalent across the board, 100 percent that the libertarian wing of the Republican Party and the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, a kind of whole showing together. They're kind of opposite extremes, but they're actually quite close on this stuff. Also on NSA stuff and civil liberties. Like I really wish we could galvanize a community of likeminded people who have basically broadly socially libertarian and kind of culturally sophisticated people to enact policies like this. And I think that. I think that that group, that core is growing.

Speaker 3:          02:05:24       The trend is definitely moving in that direction and I think the only thing that would stop it as some sort of cataclysmic disaster sends us back to this really difficult struggle and removes our access to information.

Speaker 4:          02:05:35       Well actually I think what he always does, it is like an attack. If we get hit again in, you know, in a, on a scale of nine slash 11 or heaven forbid worse, which probably would be, if it were another example of mega terrorism, um, then you will get people clinging to their religion more and gun, going back and being less tolerant and being much, much more okay with their civil liberties being infringed that we more antagonistic. That's the really corrosive effective.

Speaker 3:          02:06:02       But don't you think things come in waves. I mean there are, there are like a heightened civilizations that fall apart and then they come back and go and forth and it's like if you look at history, we like to think of history as being some straight linear path to 2014 with progress from day one to day. You know, but it's not. I mean, there's ages of enlightenment and there's is decreases and there's cataclysmic disasters, natural disasters, horrific things that happened that throw people back. I mean, there's people that argue that Iraq and especially Baghdad, I've never recovered from the Mongol invasion of the 12 hundreds. They killed everyone in the city, turned the river red with blood and black with ink, literally slaughtered all the scholars, threw away all the. I mean, the one thing that people in this day and age don't realize is that Islam used to be the center of Science of philosophy. I mean, that was the original advanced course.

Speaker 4:          02:06:57       Sure. Yeah. Yeah. They were onto, onto the enlightenment along time before we were. That's the. That's the odd thing about the way that the tables have turned. I mean, look at the. Yeah, the library of Alexandria, Alexandria burned down and we lost massive resources of human civilization. Yet as we say in Australia, it's swings and roundabouts, meaning, you know, it comes and goes.

Speaker 3:          02:07:16       Well, I think we're looking at things on an unbelievably large scale and we're looking at these little blips and these blips are very important to us because our lives are so short in perspective. You know, if you. If you look at the concept of a human life being only 100 years at the very best and look at a 100 years in to the 10,000 years of human history. It's a fucking blink of an eye

Speaker 4:          02:07:38       and the 10,000 years of human history is a blink is a blip in comparison to the age of the, of the earth and the age of the earth is a blip. And on the age of the universe and

Speaker 3:          02:07:47       talk to folks like. There's a guy named Randall Carlson who have had on the podcast who's an expert in Astro asteroidal impacts and he believes that the whole reason for this 10,000 year like our idea of human civilization being 10,000 years. He thinks that goes back way further than that. And he points to all these meteor impacts. And especially in Asia and in Europe. In a $12,000. When they go to these core samples of the earth, you go back to about 12,000 years ago, there's all this evidence of what's called nuclear glass try thing. It's called Triton night. That means that the earth was pelted by meteors, human civilizations prior to that. Most certainly he's. He's absolutely there any fossil evidence. There's evidence in far as far as construction that we're starting to uncover now let go. Beckley, Beckley, Tapi is this massive stone structure that existed back when they thought that people were just hunters and gatherers and it's a recently on earth and to this day they've only gotten about five percent of it on earth, but it's these massive stone columns, 19 feet high that are between 12 and 14,000 years old at a time where they didn't think anyone was

Speaker 4:          02:08:49       building as scientifically minded guy on on issues where I don't really know what I'm talking about. I usually just get gail to the majority of expert opinion and that's so far outside of what we most archeologists claim more. Just go with them. No, it's not anymore, right?

Speaker 3:          02:09:03       Yeah. Go back to the tap, but you need to look at this because this is, well 100 percent established science would. The reason why it's established is go beckley. Tappy was somehow or another covered up on purpose, so they were most likely conquered by someone else and these structures were covered. So when they do these, uh, these carbon samples of the soil, it's uniform from the top to the bottom, which means that somewhere around 12,000 years ago these things were covered up. That means it could be far older than that because you're dealing with stone structures and meaning it could be 13,000. Who knows how old it could be, but

Speaker 4:          02:09:38       these are huge structures that were created. Jamie, pull it up if you get a chance. Also, it depends on how you define civilization, right? I mean, this is really advanced stuff. Look, I don't mean to be old pc about this, but the Australian aborigines, they are 80 to 120,000 years old. The oldest surviving civilization now, they don't build big, you know, big structures. But to survive for 100,000 years in a stable form, to have language, to have a certain culture to, you know, to know how to, how to use the land and to know how to hunt and to build tools and all that sort of stuff. Like that's a, that's a long time that makes our sort of 5,000 years of, you know, modern civilization look like just nothing. I think like sue was about 6,000 years ago. That was what we considered to be the first written language and cuny cuneiform. Yeah. I'm sort of just counting it from the of Judaism, I suppose in the Iliad and the Odyssey and the Talmud.

Speaker 3:          02:10:36       This, um, go back. The tappy discovery is just one of many that they're slowly starting to uncover. Because when you look at these structures, a lot of them are there, they're covered up with dirt. The Amazon, they're constantly finding these ancient civilizations. They have no explanation for the Amazon ancient structures that have actually become like hills and they find these hills and they go, I think this might've been a building. And then they start hacking through it. And then they bring in a radar and they just, they, they pound the earth with radar to try to understand what's underneath it and they find these builders

Speaker 4:          02:11:08       things that amazing how quickly we can forget our history such that we don't even know that. Like I would have thought that there'd be a continuity of human experience and human record keeping in some way that we would. We would know that we wouldn't have to be making this stuff up.

Speaker 3:          02:11:21       Well, that's what Randall Carlson comes in because Randall Carlson, who's an expert in these asteroidal impacts, says that human beings have had to reset that. There's been several resets over the course of many, many millions of years, or in many hundreds of thousands of years of life. There's also a super volcano in Indonesia that they've attributed to be one of the main reasons why all human beings come from one individual genetic source. They think that 75,000 years ago, the Super Volcano, that glue, it's much larger than yellowstone and yellowstone blows. We are all fucked. Like it's going to kill almost everyone in this continent eventually and globally. It's going to have a massive effect to nuclear winter, a massive climate change, and every six to 800,000 years, this fucking goes off. It's a called volcano. That's, I believe it's 600 kilometers wide, which is 300 miles and they only discovered this, that this used to be a volcano in the beginning of the 20th century when they started using satellite imagery when they started looking at yellow stone from space and they were like, um, it's kind of fucking cap that blew off and left a crater. Like,

Speaker 4:          02:12:30       it's like we're just going about our lives, you know, the best laid plans of mice and men. I mean, it'll all go to hell at some point.

Speaker 3:          02:12:36       Some point, and this is at yellowstone, that's the Caldera fucking terrifying. And they figured that out from space where they looked at it and so that used to be a mountain and that mountain exploded and left behind this sort of crater looking.

Speaker 4:          02:12:51       It's amazing in terms of the continuity of civilizations and how we. And that, that reset that. I was reading a fascinating pace about. There was a a commission to figure out how to. We were talking about radioactive waste earlier on how long this lasts, right? The radioactive waste from nuclear stockpiles. How do you build signs for future civilization? To tell them not to touch the weights don't go. There is an act. There is a fascinating. I think it's in slate. A fascinating article about the commission which was which had the commission which has been commissioned to figure out. Let's assume that there's a civilizational reset, which there probably will be right at some point while this stuff is still bad, so these people aren't going to know our language. They're not gonna understand that a skull and crossbones means this is bad. They're not going to.

Speaker 4:          02:13:40       They may not even understand the concept that we may lose the technology to nuclear and understand what nuclear is. They May. That happens. Surprisingly often. That happens. We know it's already already. I'm losing where my photos are from hard drives that are just three. How drives it go, right? You know, multiply that by a million and suddenly they're designing like these, these huge landscapes of like interlocking sticks that are like, you know, hundreds of feet high to try to imply that this is a bad, this is a bad thing and that you shouldn't dig it up. But I mean at the end of the day what the conclusion was, you probably just shouldn't put anything there because people were always going to be curious and you never going to convince them like, you know, we go into the, we go into the tombs of the Pharaoh in, you know, in Egypt because we just think that their beliefs about, about, uh, you know, the, the bad that will come to us from going in. There are silly fantasies. What a future civilizations think that we're full of silly fantasies when we tell them not to go into nuclear waste.

Speaker 3:          02:14:39       That's absolutely possible. And I think we would need something like Georgia guidestones or like some giant Rosetta stone in several different languages to sort of let them decode it. And if we do have a civilizational reset, like a barbaric type civilization is all that's left and we literally like walking dead, running around, scavenging for food and everyone forgets how to count. I mean fuck man, people are. A lot of people are going to die of cancer and if it's the only people that are left on earth are people that live in Nevada, they might all die. I mean that's very possible. If you're talking about 75,000 people, which is low or 75,000 years ago, which they think a few thousand people were leftover. That's right. Isn't that amazing? That's it. Yeah. Yeah. This Indonesia.

Speaker 4:          02:15:22       Okay. And when we are all much more closely related than you would ever assume from that bottle necking period, where, where humanity dwindled down to just a few a few pipes.

Speaker 3:          02:15:31       So where their thinking is 75,000 years ago, giant sums of people were wiped out. And then 10 to 12,000 years ago again, giant amounts of people were wiped out. And that's where civilization had it's reset. That's also the end of the ice age. That's also the almost instantaneous death of woolly mammoths, Saber Tooth Tigers, and it's this moment, this event that they're showing in geological evidence. It's indisputable. There was absolutely some sort of huge meteorological event, some sort or media event asteroidal event where we were pelted were pelted with and it's not like it's unusual. It's like something like 900,000 near Earth objects had been mapped out.

Speaker 4:          02:16:09       Yeah, we, this is actually a really easy thing to solve, but we don't put the money into solving it yet. If you identify it far enough out, it's a simple calculation to be able to do the math and go, oh well that one's going to hit us. And then you just got to send up a bunch of nukes to nudge it off course if you catch it early. But if you don't catch it until it's almost here rude,

Speaker 1:          02:16:29       they don't think they think that anymore. I don't think they think nukes. I think the idea's to nudge it out of the way, but with changing the, um, the um, what, what is it called? The aerodynamics of the, uh, of the, the asteroids idea. It's interesting putting a web on it somehow or another will affect how a. I mean, I'm sure there are a bunch of things, but it's difficult engineering thing to come up with a figure to figure out a way to nudge an asteroid. I don't know if that's true and I also think there's also an issue with space because of the gravity of the sun. There's a lot of things that come from behind the sun that we don't even see coming because the gravity of the sun altar space, it alters the way we view things, but kind you factor that in.

Speaker 1:          02:17:07       I mean we spent around the sun so we get to see all four corners of the of the universe as we go around, but to this day constantly there's things that come very close to us that we don't see coming because we. Because Republicans cut funding to NASA and stuff like that. Well, I would like to think that that's the case, but I think it might be slightly beyond our grasp right now. To see all of them coming. Things that are coming from the North Pole and the South Pole. They're coming from places where we're not really observing the sky, very vigilantly and you know, a lot of what we find is actually discovered by amateur astronomers. They find asteroids and they named them and measure them and then they send in their data and how many of those fuckers are out there. I mean, I don't know how many people are out there actively searching for asteroids.

Speaker 1:          02:17:50       I don't think it's very many and I think it's shocking. But you're talking about the policy concern, which I agree with. I'm talking about there are two concerns, right? One is, would it be, do we have the scientific and engineering know how to be able to nudge a, an asteroid out of the way if we catch it early enough. And then the other question is, are we bothering to look? And it's the question that I'm, that I'm more concerned about. I think we're getting close, but I also think there's the issue of collisions when asteroids collide with each other and then send one hurling towards us that we didn't expect that can happen too. We're fucked. Fuck. We're all fucked. So, uh, we did another hour. That's good. So I'm gonna go take a chill pill, take a chill pill. Tell everybody one more time. How do we get to your show Josh steps on twitter.

Speaker 1:          02:18:30       You can either go to buy. Well actually my website stand on the web, so don't worry about that. It's just steps on twitter. J O s h Z, z e PPS. I always want to say it's dead because that's what you're saying. Um, but uh, but shoot an email. Just open your email address. Please don't know. I want them to because they that can subscribe. It's just info. It's not my personal address info at we the people pod because we, the people are going to be the night of the live show info. That way the people pod.com. And tell us what part of this conversation you liked the most and then you'll get free stuff. When I launched. I'm going to read that much on employee, so I'll find something. Josh steps. Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you sir. This a beautiful conversation. I really enjoyed it. I'd love to. When are you gonna? Be In la again. I don't know. Whenever you invite me back, we'll work it out. Great. Thank you.
