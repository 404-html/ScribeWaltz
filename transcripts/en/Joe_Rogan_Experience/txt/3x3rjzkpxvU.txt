Speaker 1:          00:00          The general good experience for sure. He's going to win again. I'm going to be the president. So you think for sure he wins again because is that because whoever the Democrats decide to put in, is it going to be an equal turd? Sandwich again, you're a super smart dude, but you're also a bruton. Your big giant savage motherfucker. Right? So how many people have underestimated you because you're a big giant savage motherfucker planning talk stupid to you and acted like you were a moron. I'd say equal street fights. Two fights in the UFC. Yeah, there's a lot of people. Right? And just people in general, like they'll get snotty and take stevie at tree. I'm glad I'm going like my men.

Speaker 1:          00:43          But I think there's a certain part of us that might be doing that with him. I don't think he is. I think he's really good at winning. This is this, this is not a, not an like an endorsement of him. Um, no caveats necessary. I'm horrified by this immigration policy of separating children from their parents. I think that subhuman, his wife came out and said that was bullshit. His wife's an immigrant bro. His wife barely speaks English. It's chaos, right? It's crazy. I hate. I hate all that stuff. These are just families. They're just. People love each other. You got to keep them together. If they break the law, you keep them together. Get them out of here if you want. I mean, if you want to send them back to wherever they came from, if you're, you're hell bent on that. But taking them from their kids is subhuman.

Speaker 1:          01:33          I mean it's beyond that. It's not us. It's not what we're doing in 2018. That aside all that aside, he's probably gonna fucking win again, man. I think he's probably gonna win again. I think he. He gets in these confrontations with people and they think he's adult. I don't think he's adult. I think he's. There's no way he can be as successful as he bent. I know he's had his ups and downs and shit like that, but like what? He just just the way he was able to dismantle all those guys in those Republican debates, we told them to fuck apart from apart. They have no business. They had no business doing that with him. They just were too emotionally tied up in his responses. There was so much negativity and energy. Uh, it was like, it. There's all this anxiety like a fight where a guy's in a full panic, you know, you've seen it like street fights, especially guys just go into full panic or even just talking shit and the school yard, you know, one guy's getting bullied.

Speaker 1:          02:31          Bullies got the crowd watching them and the other guys will, but, but your, your fuck you man. He's like, ah, that ain't gonna work. You know? That's Kinda, that's what the rest of them look like. Ted Cruz, that's what they all looked like. He's just been doing this his whole life. He's been talking shit his whole life, you know, and he's got a lot of fucking supporters. And if the economy keeps doing good, man, it's gonna be a hard sell to put some guy in there like Bernie Sanders, you know, all the right wing people think, just wants to give away all your money, give away all your money to welfare brats. Even the left was protecting against that, right? Because there's still money left on the left. I should point out, I know Jack Shit about politics. It was very important to point out 100 percent. I've read all of the works, almost all of them.

Speaker 1:          03:17          And he is brilliant trainer that. I agree with that 100 percent outside of competition. Let's explain it to people. Yeah. Okay. So, so me. Okay. So let's say for instance, let's say, you know, I'm a big believer in never being sore. You should train the next day she'd wake up feeling good. Okay. No. Why? How's that possible? Well, because look, if, if. Okay, that's great. That's a good example. Let's say, um, let's see your energy levels of second about fit people by the way, right? If you met every human being, every guy has never worked out before. First, they never called. Is it possible to work out and not be sore? No problem. You okay? Here we go. So let's say there's something called cr rate of perceived exertion. Okay? So let's say I make you do pull ups and let's say the maximum on a pull ups you can do. The maximum amount of bullet is 10. Let's keep a nice round number at 11. You couldn't do 11. If I put a pointed a gun at you, you couldn't do 11.

Speaker 1:          04:11          Should I make you do 10 pull ups on our workout? No. I'm going to make you do five. Why? Because I'm setting you up to work the next day. The next day we're going to do five and the next day we're going to do another five and then we're gonna do six. One six is really easy. We're going to do seven y if you count if the. If you did 10 pull ups on Monday, you're going to be sore throat. Thursday. Let's this really your Max. So Thursday you've only done 10 pull ups from Monday to Thursday. You've only done 10 pull ups. Me, I've been doing five pull ups every day, so I'm a 20 pull ups already. Twenty five pull ups. I have more volume than you. Now, if you add up at the end of the year, who trained more, I've trained way more than you, so let's say I go to Jitsu practice. I'm doing Jujitsu every single day, three rounds, five days a week. That's 15 rounds. You go in twice a week, but you kill yourself. You do five rounds each day you kill, you push yourself. Those last two rounds, you burn yourself out. I still did 15 year at 10. At the end of the year I've done countless rounds and what I may have had so much more training than you. So how much training can we pack in the week?

Speaker 1:          05:12          That's the real question. How much volume can you expose your athlete too? So I always tell people, look, energy, sorry, exercise can produce energy. So let's say I'm feeling like a seven out of 10, 10 being I'm really energized. One, I was like really lethargic, feeling like I need to lay down and seven, I'm feeling good. Okay. If I get up and I do a right amount of exercise, the right amount, I can feel like an eight point five exercise can give me a tonic effect, like drinking this coffee. So let's say I just do some jumping jacks. I hit the back for a couple rounds. I'm feeling good. Once you get that high, shut it down. Don't go into the phase where your body's beat up tight, broken up, don't redline the body that's only for training camps for pe for a small period of time. Why? Because you get a little bit more from the system, but in the long run you get less in the long run. You've tax the system. So if you do that regularly, by the time you actually get good

Speaker 2:          06:06          broken up is, you know, a realm of experience, a realm of knowing that these things give access to that's normally close to us. I mean, it's kind of a trivial statement of course. Um, but then you get down to questions of how verifiable is that? How real is that? How, uh, you know, and people get. I don't know if the term is hung up, but they can get baffled when you start talking about, you know, the reality of say the entities you encounter on dmt. I mean this is, this is some people I know are obsessed with trying to verify the reality of the entities that you find on dmt. And again, it comes down to if you experienced them, they're real. If anything you experienced is real because you've experienced it, does it have a corresponding existence in the external world? Well, you know, what's external?

Speaker 2:          07:11          Let's eating turtle. You know, we, we, we throw around these terms, these, these epistomological metaphysical terms quite carelessly without really thinking about it. What does it mean when you say, I'm in here and you're out there, you know, and then you take a psychedelic and you realize that's an artificial boundary. You know, we're all one. There is no separation. It's separate in normal consciousness though it's separated in normal conscious. But then what is normal conscious if not a reflection of year, neurochemical brain, state. I mean, everything you experience is an altered state because it's filtered into this brain, processed by the brain, and the brain is a biochemical engine that you know, as I say, often were made out of drug,

Speaker 1:          08:02          but it seems that our normal consciousness is the best state to propagate biological life and to keep our Aes, our whatever we've created in terms of our community structures and relationships and friendships and the ability to build structures and houses and things like that. These, all of these things are done best when you're here and present. Whereas when you're on a psychedelic state, I agree with you. Well, the way I've always described it as if you had a meeting with God and you went and God gave you all the answers to the world and you, you experienced undeniable beauty in the most extreme form possible where you couldn't have imagined it and then you came back. Whether you hallucinated it or not, it's the exact same experience. Exactly. You can't put it on a scale right way it, like we've stretched the tape measure and God is 47

Speaker 2:          08:56          inches across like just because, you know what I'm saying? Just because you can't measure it with what we term our, our, our, you know, our metrics for reality. Right. And that is exactly the thing. Don't worry about whether it's real and the way we would define real. Is it good information or is it bad or is it not? That's the thing. It doesn't matter where it comes from, it's such a good information. Then it has its own internal validity of whether it came from some part of yourself that is normally obscurity you or uh, came from the teacher or the aliens transmitting it through.

Speaker 3:          09:38          It doesn't really matter. It's a little wet, but I just remember being a kid and like my uncle like wasn't married or had kids. I was always like, what's up with them? Smart. That guy, it's partying. Seems a go on the bill Maher route. Do you burp? But without getting me into the alarm. Do you have a Bill Maher character? You do? I saw you did it. You went to those people who didn't have those people. You're not okay. You don't. There is no god. Okay. Like I know everything. I kind of do agree with a lot of what he says.

Speaker 2:          10:22          Yeah. He's a smart guy that shows a weird show. Everybody talking over each other.
