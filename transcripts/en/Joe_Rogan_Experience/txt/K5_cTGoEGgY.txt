Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Hello Sweet bitches out there in cyberspace or wherever you are. Maybe you're on a treadmill right now. Maybe you're in your car, maybe driving, maybe a board is fuck at work. Wherever you are, we're here for you bitches. Well, that's the delay. That's my laptop. That's the difference between what I say and when it reaches you. So think about that while this is going on, what's you're hearing? Is it fucking timewarp? Okay, it's seconds behind the actual reality of my words. Like, oh no asteroid at soc, we got hit and then the power went off and then use stream gets it five seconds later. Well, if an astroid hit like Arizona, it would take a while for, we'd knew. Well, no, not really. That's too close. But if it hit like Sweden, we probably wouldn't know for like a second or two. We'd probably would hear about it like a week in advance though.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       Well, if one of those dinosaur killers is on the way we, that'd be fucking looting and rioting and there would be no more squarespace.com like how a segue. It's like a professional should be on the radio.

Speaker 1:          00:03:40       It's the prince. It's probably someone who like had like Hashtag like they own the name Hashtag and the fucking hated the pound time. Like that pound guys at Dick Guy owns pound fuck pound. It's not pallets fucking Hashtag now. And it worked. We're going to repurpose this whole need for existence. They figured out how to do it though. That's what's amazing. Like they pulled it off. They actually pulled off the the Hashtag cu and now you'll get people in the next few years. Where kids now, why is there a Hashtag on the phone? What do you use this once? It's there once it's named, it's named. How the fuck did they change it? It's, that's amazing. It's got confused. So many kids. It's going to confuse the shit out of him. They did a really good job. If you really looked at it from like a conqueror standpoint, hashtag dominated the pound sign.

Speaker 1:          00:04:23       We're not going to have it dialpad in the future. I'm surprised we still do. You know? Yeah. Most likely. Yeah.

We're constantly adding new things. We're constantly finding new supplements, new strength and conditioning equipment and just do stuff that we find that we feel is beneficial. One of the big ones is we've started a whole series of a artistic kettlebells and I know a guy like Scott Sigler horror author can appreciate that the fantasy behind the Zombie kettle bells or the primal bells. The idea behind them is you will work out harder if you really were fighting against the fucking Zombie invasion. If you're preparing for the Zombie invasion, you have to keep your family alive.

Speaker 1:          00:06:55       You will have that extra revenue. You will have that one extra set where you don't want to do it anymore. And uh, if you swing around these fully functional Zombie Bell Kettle Bells that can, that can give you that feeling, they can give you that, that, that fear that you need to complete your workout. My favorites of the primal bells, cause I'm a big fan of the monkey community, big fan of the apes. Mad shout out to all the primates. Uh, I just love the fact that they're artistic and they're actually fully functional. We Act, we had them besides being designed and drawn and created by this Guy Steven Shubin Jr. We also had them three d printed. We all, we, we hit three d balanced. Rather we had to make sure that when you're swinging this kettle bell, it'll have the same functional use as a real kettle bell that just looks like a smooth cannon ball.

Speaker 1:          00:07:46       So it's not just a design. They work just as well as a real credible and they will fucking last for the rest of your life. I mean, look at the giant metal sculptures that are heavy as fuck and you get to see a look on the Postmates face when he delivers that shit. Like what the fuck son? What are you doing here? Um, you don't even need a big one to get a good workout in. I do one of my workouts, the entire workouts with one 35 pound kettle bell. We sell that DVD. That's the Keith Weber Kettle Bell Cardio extreme workout. It's fucking madness. That dude's a savage. He does it with a 45 pounder. That fucking animal. Um, we saw all sorts of different things that we feel, uh, help with a athletic performance and what you would call functional strength. That's the trend these days when you see all this crossfit type stuff and all this people that are training, you know, you see mixed martial arts training with club bells and battle ropes and shit like that.

Speaker 1:          00:08:41       The idea behind all of that is that in the olden days when they used to do just like, you know, preacher curls and you know, things, things along those lines, there were things that were good and there's things that were bad, but there was a lot of people that were imbalanced. In a few uh, view laugh at the, the, the classic meathead is the guy who is a meatball with two toothpicks holding it up. Guy Who's got a gigantic upper body and a small lower body. He's not balanced. He's not, that's not an athletic body. That's not a body, a little work for you. That's your, you're being silly bitch and your tits are huge. You don't need that in your life, okay? You want functional strength. Stop getting so crazy. We sell all kinds of stuff@a.com the best shit that we can find in any and all forms, whether it's supplements, whether it's strength and conditioning equipment, whether it's food, we even sell the best blenders for making Kale shakes and protein shakes on a.com o. N. N. I. T. Use the code name. Rogan. Save yourself 10% off any and all supplements. All right. Scott says we're going to get crazy. We're going to talk about some scary shit and

Speaker 2:          00:09:43       go

Speaker 3:          00:09:46       well, good experience. Oh yeah. And before we get started, what do you, when your shows in Texas, you got three this week.

Speaker 2:          00:09:56       Houston, a Friday or Thursday,

Speaker 3:          00:09:59       Tony Hinchcliffe and a Tiffany Haddish.

Speaker 3:          00:10:15       so you do a live podcast, live podcast. Which one are you gonna do you gonna do kill Tony? Are you going to let like local comics go up and shit? I, we eat. It's going to be, we have some local girls that work for playboy and uh, we're just going to make it a mess. Perfect. Yeah, bringing alcohol. Don't try and do it. So, but yeah, exactly. Be careful here in Texas, they don't play games. They party hard. Texas parties hard and I do a blackout podcast before the show. I feel like you will, whether you want to or not. Why are you pretending like he played on the side of some piece of art. It's just going to be what it is. Don't be silly son. Uh, so, uh, where are these dates? Where the uh, the actual clubs? It's January or this Thursday. It's going to be in Houston. It's going to be at Fitzgerald's. Uh, and then, uh, the following day it's going to be an Austin with Tiffany Haddish at the spider house ballroom. And then a Saturday it's going to be at the curtain club in Dallas, Texas with a squad TV

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       for all the info on all Brian stuff. And that's where you can also buy those t shirts, you know, all the kitty cat desk squad tee shirts. Um, I mean the Houston this weekend. No, I'm not in Houston. I'm in Phoenix this weekend. Jesus Christ. You're in Houston. I'm in Phoenix. Where am I? I'm in the valley. Um, I mean, uh, the Phoenix standup live, which is fucking awesome venue. I love that place. And I'm there with the lovely and talented Thompson Guerra, who's one of the most fucking hilarious dudes on the planet. So I'm really psyched. I Love Phoenix. Phoenix is a fun town. They don't take themselves too seriously. They like to party. They like to drink. They're close enough to la. The not retarded. They get, they get the vibe. It's a fun place. Uh, I'll be there this weekend with a Tommy Cigar

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       and then January 24th I'll be at the Chicago theater with the Super Jew. Are you should fear slinging Dick. He's definitely moving. He's a, he's going to be here for the winter. Look, it's minus 10 in New York right now. Cool. December, right? Yeah. I Dunno call this. I've ever heard about it. I never heard about minus 10 minus 10 is ridiculous, Scott Sigler. It is, it's not necessary. Right. I moved away from Michigan specifically cause I don't like minus 10. Yeah. Or 20 or 30. Michigan's rough dude. How you lived there your whole life. Yeah. I live there. A write up to about, uh, early, early thirties or so. We're just going to after that San Francisco, uh, that's a good place to go. Was Dead, you know, traipse about the country, three months here, six months there. Never made it out of San Francisco is a big difference between the, the general mentality of Michigan versus San Francisco.

Speaker 3:          00:12:43       It's very unusual when you go to two places that are so completely different. You Go, oh look, this can happen to a bunch of people can just act like this or you know, you can go to like Vancouver or something where everybody's nice and friendly and you're like, okay, you could just be in this weird town where everybody's nice and friendly or you could go to Boston and they want to beat the fuck out of your way. Like, Oh, you know, this could happen to there really there really is a cultural signature to every place. The difference between Michigan and San Francisco was pretty dramatic. What did that feel like when you made that transition? All of a sudden you're around all these like I mean San Francisco, super liberal and really like open minded about, I mean I always feel like as far as like socially when you look at the entire country, like as far as like the most progressive parts of the country, you have the coasts always, you know, the, the most progressive, but at all of them, San Francisco seems to be the most extreme, the first to be like super accepting of gays.

Speaker 3:          00:13:40       The first, I mean the whole Berkeley psychedelic movement, all that shift from the CFTS, the echoes of that still feel like they're hanging around that place. And it's even changing again now with all of that.co texts version on the tech people and rents are rising and real estate's never really slow. I mean it leveled out at a couple of places, but it's never dropped and it's come back up. And um, you know, the inability for people working a regular job to even be able to afford to live in a city is worse now. So it's the whole, I think the whole liberal, just salt of the places is changing again and now it's just becoming about money. You're totally right. Yeah. The real estate prices there are fucking crazy. Yup. There was a, there's one neighborhood that I was looking at. I was just a, I was there visiting a friend. I was like, wow, this place is beautiful. It's like near San Jose. This houses were like a regular, it was like a regular house and it was $9 million. Yeah. And I was like, what the fuck is that? That's a regular house. It's not even a crazy mansion. It's a beautiful house, but it's just a house house house. The biggest shock we had was, uh, we came to San Francisco and start looking around and one of the places phones, literally, it converted. It's a one bedroom apartment that is now a tenancy

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       in common or a condo and it's a one bedroom bout 750 square feet. It was $800,000. And I had worked in Michigan for a company that built homes and for basically for 800 grand in Michigan. You own everything you see. Yeah. Like God, you have like one of those Ted Nugent compounds. You've got, you've got your own herd of elk on campus. It's just nuts and that that's a one bedroom and it really hasn't changed all that much since then, but you'd have to live in Michigan to ignore it, to enjoy it rather. Yeah, well, yeah, you have to like 10 below and there's, you know, there's no comparison for the cultural broadness of San Francisco. There's a ton of crap to do there and a ton of things to experience. I don't know. That's worth 800,450 square foot apartment, but it's pretty sweet. Yeah. That's a bizarre thing when the amount of wealth in an area and becomes so concentrated that regular people just can't live there.

Speaker 4:          00:15:42       He just literally can't afford to. It's getting crazier and crazier because there's so many people that have made a lot of money and technology and they, they're centered around that area. I mean the amount of wealth, the concentrated amount of wealth in San Francisco, just tech wealth is, and a lot, a lot of stuff's coming up from silicon valley now back in his San Francisco and that close enough that I feel like it's the same thing. It's pretty, it's pretty similar now there's even protesters blocking like the Google bus, the Google buses that pick up all the, the 20 something Ivy League graduates who are just wicked, wicked, smart, hardworking people who go to work for Google and they get on their bus with their Wifi. You know, it's so it's perfect little limo bus and then you've got regular working class Joe's parking in front of it with a picket sign and you know, sometimes rattling the bus or throwing stuff at the bus.

Speaker 4:          00:16:31       They're really, people are blaming the silicon valley tech companies for the rents rising to the point where if you just want to work at like a bookstore, if that's what you're calling is, you want to do that. You can't afford to live in the city at all anymore. Those people are are super mad that they can't live where they want to live. It's a, it's a strange situation. That's very strange. I don't think I can recall any place where that's happened before that I know about. I can't think of it. I can't think of it either. But you know to be one of these people on the bus and all of a sudden you know the populous is rising up against you in burning torches and banging signs against the bus. That's got to be pretty scary. Yeah, and all you there is working. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:17:08       They're trying to do what you gone to school for and which you're practicing with. People are so fucking strange. It's hard. It's super hard for the people working in these companies to relate. I think because I've had the opportunity to go do a couple things in the Google campus with a company I used to work for and they are super hardworking people. Super Nice, really creative and clever. I mean all of these cultures are very open and letting people pursue what they want to pursue and they, they just bust their ass. They work really hard, so it's how you can't really relate. I have a good friend who works for Google, she loves it there. I think that what you're dealing with when you, you, you see a situation like this is this insane new wealth, the this insane tech

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       wealth, this industry that it's over the last couple of decades become so gigantic because the amount of money that it generates is just freakish. When you think about like cell phones, think about any other product that you sell. You know, you might have one and this guy might have while like say if you make like a vacuum sealers for food, I like to keep my vegetables fresh. How many of those are going to sell, sell, sell phones though? You're going to sell

Speaker 4:          00:18:17       ah, fuck clothes they catch on. Yeah. [inaudible] of people on the planet. Like the amount of money you can make if you sell cell phones is fucking beyond comprehension, right? Well, they're, they're, they're like one of these, like how many of these, and they saw the lumber barons and the steel barons and the oil barons of all the, all those different times and it history. One bigger. The Vanderbilts came out and just had in crazy amounts of money and all the steel and everything else. It's exactly the same thing. It's this brand new thing that all of the world needs and it's controlled by a limited amount of people, but the people are smart as fuck. Yeah, it's really a good, good amount of Pete. You know, if you're going to be controlled by the right amount of people or the right kind of people, the Google people, not bad robots though. Now they've got a share per kilo. They're preparing because seriously, man, if other people get killed, the robots

Speaker 1:          00:19:07       first, we've got a real problem. It's the Oppenheimer dilemma. Do you make the atomic bomb knowing it's going to kill millions of people or do you let the Russians make it first and kill millions of people over here or the Germans rather?

Speaker 4:          00:19:18       It's the same dilemma. Well Google Google's cutting out the middle or the government, just like, we're going to be able to protect our own stuff. It'll be fine. What do you think Google? Yeah, Google is going to start buying arms companies next or making their own.

Speaker 1:          00:19:29       The robotics people like, oh, I know a couple of people. You know, I make a robot dog, but I also know Mike, Mike, my neighbor, he makes missiles.

Speaker 4:          00:19:37       When would you guys want to do things? Thinking that you could fucking hiring the greatest engineers of our day to build missiles for Google? Come over. We'll have a kegger. We'll put all this stuff together. And one day in like 2024 Google just shows up at the Federal Reserve and Gos stop. It's over yet. Get Out. Everybody get out. We run things now. We don't want, when I want your money anymore. Does it mean anything incredibly? I mean, this is not conspiracy theory to say it's not all that far fetched. If they buy up the weapons, making technology and have all this stuff, their ability to influence policy could get pretty, pretty significant. So

Speaker 1:          00:20:10       our ability to, uh, to first of all as citizens to, to recognize that we're getting screwed over on a daily basis and also recognize that the government is invading our privacy on a daily basis. You know, when, when people start recognizing those kinds of things and you'll look at the, like some of the, some of the lawsuits that had been brought up against people, some of, uh, some of the people that have lost like giant chunks of their time and their life fighting off the government, whether it's because of taxes or because of regulations or whatever the fuck it is. If you stopped and thought like engineering that and making it the way it is, you would never, you'd never design it this way. That's the way it is. It's so gross. And the IRS can go after people that, you know, if you don't pay your taxes, they just throw you in prison.

Speaker 1:          00:20:59       They want you to be so scared that you have to pay them their money if you don't pay them their money, they treat you as if you're a dangerous criminal that you have to take out of society. And lock in. You are a dangerous criminal to them. They're, they're an organization and a company just like anybody else. And if it gets, if the information gets out there that yeah, there's really no repercussions for you not giving us our revenue, then they're screwed. Then enough people say, yeah, we're not paying you and you've lost your income and your company goes under. Did you hear about the beanie babies thing? No. The guy who created beanie babies, he paid $1 billion in taxes and they're like, hmm. Not Enough. What I like, we need like 1,000,000,005 million. He hid some, some money somewhere. He had some money. This mother Fucker, if he paid $1 billion in taxes, he's probably on coke all day.

Speaker 1:          00:21:43       It has no idea how much money he has. Probably nothing to do. Nothing to do with this thing. You know, like hiding money. Like, what are you talking to please fucking made beanie babies. He's not like, you know, he's not a nuclear engineer. He's a crazy fuck. That made something that for some reason made him so much money that he paid $1 billion in taxes. But they're like, that's the look that one up and he dd to pay some more. That's a lot of money in taxes. You think $1 billion in taxes would be for frigging beanie babies would be good. It's ridiculous. It's completely ridiculous. So when Google takes over and skynet goes live, you know that guy will get his money back. That is all the Federal Reserve pay him. Google's the Robin Hood of Beanie baby founders. But uh, maybe would she, I mean I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility that our government and our, not just our government, but our military is run through technology and just a few years to the point where it's gonna get real gray.

Speaker 1:          00:22:39       Whether or not like who has power? Is it going to be country? Is it going to remain countries? Is it going to eventually shift into corporations? Are Corporate entities and we were talking about like how much money there is in technology and creating things at a certain point in time. The technology is going to reach the point where people can essentially do whatever the fuck they want. You know, there's the ongoing question is, are the corporation is actually running things now already as the government come relatively puppet structure based on who's pumping the most campaign money in et cetera. And now you're talking about artificial intelligence coming into the place. I say yes, yes, yes. And I think it's absolutely the case of the corporations have gotten to an insanely influential place, insanely powerful ability to control the results of elections and the, the way the world works. I mean it's really incredible, but what's most incredible is that it's a bunch of people, corporations, just a bunch of people, bunch of people are doing some things. It's like really bad for humanity can make you fuck loads of money for the corporation, for the corporation. You at it from, you

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       know, the artificial organism structure of a corporation. You know how low the Coca Cola company has been alive longer than any human being on the planet. You know, and now you've got whatever these, and it's a lot like the means of religion or, or national nationalism. These structures, the self replicating and self supporting structures have been built up and they live longer than we do. So now corporations, yeah, well they're not people, but at the same time, that's a successful organism right there and it's fighting to stay alive and dominate how it wants to dominate. Yeah, that's the real skinny on it, right? It's a thing. It's a system. It's an operating entity and it, it's made out of people, but it really likes money more than it likes people. I mean, it's really amazing that people have created something that's not entirely self serving and it protects itself as it weird structure of ones and Zeros and buildings and paper.

Speaker 4:          00:24:36       And it's, to me, it's really a borderline organism because it's a, as a collective organism, all of the people working within it, there's a certain pattern of behaviors that have led to those corporations being successful and living for a hundred years or longer and only people who are following those patterns of behaviors mostly are going to be successful in there. So it's self perpetuating. So you've got this certain type of behavior, which has always put the company first, screw the rule of screw people, go out and make things profitable that works. So these companies grow and continue to live and spawn off other companies and it just keeps on going. So I mean, to me they're, you know, they're, they're not living organisms only by a technicality of definition. That's a fascinating way of looking at it. Now as an author, when you see something like this that you see may perhaps like a good majority of the people have probably overlooked you when you look at it like that.

Speaker 4:          00:25:27       I mean that's, it's, it's got to seem like almost like a work of fiction. I mean if, if, if the system in and of itself like the way it's constructed now and just the idea of sending people to go kill people they don't even know on the other side of the world, like all of it is just so bizarre. If it didn't exist in this form and someone brought it to you as a script, you'd be like, whoa. To fucking cooperate. It's a lie. It's alive and it's eating. People look at how many people the corporation comes. Oh my God, it's eating painful. Yeah. Well you know, even going back to the sky net concept of, you know, that's science fiction 25 years ago and you are now getting to the point with the globe, you know, the, the global nature of the Internet and everything else.

Speaker 4:          00:26:07       If you were able to get some kind of powerful online entity or an artificial intelligence that's not at all far fetched anymore, that somebody could control everything, not even a little. So it seems inevitable, right? I don't know about inevitable. It's definitely, definitely possible. The leap from having a system that can communicate everywhere all over the world. At one time and then jumping to something that can actually make its own decisions and decide its own destiny. I think that's an, I know very little about it but that's way bigger than people think. It's not just, oh we're going to make this smart robot and it will go through and make decisions. You know, self determination is a whole different ballgame that they haven't been able to tackle yet. So, uh, I it, it's definitely possible. It doesn't seem inevitable to me. To me it seems inevitable.

Speaker 4:          00:26:50       It seems inevitable just based on the exponential growth of technology, meaning the, you know, one equals two and two posts, one he's three and then three plus two is five. When you, when you start seeing how quickly things are developing and how quickly technology is improving and enhancing, you realize that like if we were in a horror movie and there was a horror movie about robots that eventually took over and just start raping people and eating them, it would probably start off a lot. Like what we're seeing on the news. We'd have like quick flashes of like a new robot technology and then six months later Sony releases another one and then five months after that they create some sort of an artificial brain cell that actually works better than a real brain sale. They started inserting them into people's bodies and then you cut to 50 years later, apocalyptic nightmare scenario, robots eating cinder blocks, you know, running down the street, finding the last vestiges of humanity, hiding under sewer pipes.

Speaker 4:          00:27:46       You know, my, my hope isn't whatever does come down to that. There's still, you know, people are really good at doing labor and figuring things out and they also breed and make more copies of themselves. So if you're a robot, artificial intelligence killing all the peoples, a complete and utter waste of time, why would you do that? Here's this relatively free labor pool that makes more copies of itself and continues to do what you want. Which goes back to the concept of coke, the Coca Cola brand or IBM or British companies that are five and 600 years old. You know, that's sort of already happening. There are self determined human being sourced, serving the greater purpose of the overlord organization. So your artificial intelligence could easily be like that. So I'm hoping that when we get taken over they'll just want to give us jobs and they'll want us to be happy workers.

Speaker 4:          00:28:31       I think they'll find us so inefficient and stupid. They'll want to eat us. I mean to think they'll treat us the same way we treat chimps. Yeah. Like shut the fuck up and get in the cage. I think if they use us at all, they'll have like a show that amuses them. Well they'll have the, these are actual real people. This the last of the real people. We keep them in his cage, make them fuck but treat them like killer whales. Here's the music. Here's a museum to show you the way things once were a long time ago, people needed food. Ha ha ha. Everybody will laugh. They'll think it's hilarious. They'll think natural people are just ridiculous. The idea of a natural person, it can easily become redundant. And this is a trope that's played on science fiction all the time. And I have it in some of my books too, which is once you get your artificial, uh, race or artificial intelligence, the point where it can reproduce on its own, when robots can make other versions of itself, that's when we're no longer necessary. When something can breed to make copies of itself. And I'm not necessarily talking a big factory crank things out, although that works when robots can basically basically make baby robots that harvest energy and resources from the environment and get bigger and become an adult and fully functional and capable of carrying work, then

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       we're screwed. There's no need for us anymore. Just competition at that point. He, as soon as they figured out how to make better robots, like you guys made a fucking terrible design with us. Let's just fix all of that. I mean, I wonder if we're arrogant and thinking that our, our, uh, special abilities as people, whether it's our emotions, our creativity or whatever, that they're actually really special and that they're not replicable. But what if robots are like, oh dummy, it's so easy to make something like you. Yeah. Like you're not even that complex you guys are based on like, it's really pretty obvious emotions, very predictable behavior patterns under stress. Like you guys are fucking simple. You like, you like to thank your super complicated cause it makes you happy. Well there's all this stuff we've always thought was complicated or impossible and the now we do all the time and yeah, somebody at some point could crack the chemical code of our behavior be like, oh he just mixed a little bit of this, a little bit of that boom.

Speaker 3:          00:30:30       Next thing you know he's crying. This robot's crying cause he got his heartbroken at the prom and then boom, blade runner, blade runner. Then those scenes with Rutger Hauer. What'd your Howard is dying and he doesn't want to kill Harrison Ford, but he was thinking about killing him. But he, he loves and respects life so much so he doesn't, he winds up ultimately not killing him. That's a fucking powerful movie, man. And not far off from what would actually happen if you had something and you engineered emotions into it. And if he didn't, then what do you got? You got to fucking city filled with robot psychos that have no emotions. You would want to engineer all the same flaws that people have if you wanted to create artificial people when in fact if you did that, wouldn't they be a person? Yeah. Wouldn't they be subject to jealousy and poor decision making?

Speaker 3:          00:31:13       And there's everything outside of drugs cause they would be robotic. I'm sure they'd have their own robotic drugs of some kind. You know, various buyers isn't reprogramming and anything you want, but they'd probably the point battery or batteries at some point. It, well, when they put their tongue of the battery, it's a whole different experience. At some point it would become indiscernible. You couldn't tell the difference. Um, gosh, I'm forgetting it. But there's that, uh, something test where you put a blindfold and put a blind between people. And if you can't tell the person on the other end of that computer is a robot or a person as a human being, you can't tell, am I talking to a robot? Am I talking to human being texts for him in Texas and Warren voice or text form. But if you get to that point, that's one of the definitions of we have gotten closer achieved artificial intelligence.

Speaker 3:          00:31:58       When you as a human can't tell the difference, that's when you're really close to that. And a emotions would be a big part of that in the movie. It will show people talking into their phones, asking Siri questions, googling things and while they're driving so it'll show those sort of things like that. They willingly accepted into the robot fold. We're letting them in. We as no question. Yeah, we're completely symbiotic now. Completely leave your phone at home. It's like you left your Dick Behind. Yeah. Like what do I do now? Do not leave home without my Dick, so I'm going back for that. Good. Yes. Keep my phone screwed on. Yeah, and before long they're going to come up with some solution. It runs on your own body's energy, no longer needing to charge itself in the wall. You

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       know, you could always get it surgically removed and like, hey honey, I can always get it surgically removed and next thing you know, you've got some robot patch on your arm that you're dialing and it goes straight into your ear. It's calming, it's calming implants or the next. That's the next big wave of, of all of these things that we carry on all the time. We're going to have a little USB ports on our forearms, stick it in that little wireless man. Everything will be wireless. Ocular ocular, either contact lenses or inserts below the IRS. I would suggest you see everything. You turn your Wifi off. His people are going to hack you. Yup. You don't want that. Why? This is not good. If you're going to match, it's going to have to be hardwired. We're going to need ports within a matrix. Ports, Lazy.

Speaker 4:          00:33:17       That's like you want that. You want the Matrix sport. Everybody else can be like, man, I got to reach this from here to there and plug it in. Screw that. Just give me a wireless option. Do you really think that people are that lazy? Oh God, it's ridiculous. There's plenty of people probably lazy. There's plenty of people that would plug their headset in that I think there are vastly more who would totally go at. People were a lazy, lazy bunch as a species, but they got to that point where they're not willing to like plug something into their heads. It's going to let them, do you know, anybody who's ever complain, they can't find like the remote control I have to get up and change the channel or something like that or it just helps you. But I think there's more, there's less people than that.

Speaker 4:          00:33:55       Less people like that. Then we would like, see, this is seditious talk you're having now. You're one of the people wants to plug in. You don't want the wireless. They're going to be what Google will be watching you, sir. Um, no, I don't mind the wireless look. Ultimately it's all going to be, it's going to be probably Tesla fired. You know, like Tesla wanted to have electricity in the atmosphere. You want to broadcast electricity and Westinghouse found out what he's trying to do and like get the fuck out of here and they shut his program down. His idea was to wildly transmit electricity. The same way people wire, you know, they, they transmit radio waves or transmit wifi signals, right? He was going to wirelessly have electricity fucking floating around us in some strange way. I don't, I mean I don't even understand the technology behind it, but I assumed that if it was Nikola Tesla that came up with it, this was legit stuff that's never been picked up.

Speaker 4:          00:34:45       So he, he wanted to give it away. What's the other frame? And that's the corporations going back to that talk, the self defense mechanism of the corporations kicks in. If there's a resource that's being given away for free, any corporation providing that resource is in danger of being diminished or being destroyed. So the natural reaction of the group mind of the people in the company is we got to shut that shit down right now. This is some Alex Jones talk doing on us, but we, you know, we seen it with the Edison company and their reaction to the, to Tesla and trying to find ways to stop this technology from coming out. Cause if the technology comes out, they no longer have that giant cash cow and that's, that's worth fighting for. What was the downside? Was there any downside proposed downside to projecting electricity in the air? Do you have any idea? I don't know that much about it. I'm not sure that he had proven it in a large scale. Like can it really transfer over long distances and be economically

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       viable? And then there's just the general shock of people seeing bolts of lightening flashing across the countryside. They're not very comforted by it even though it's exactly the same thing happening. You just can't see it because it's in a wire. Is that what it would be? You would see the electricity, I'm pretty sure that's, that's what it was. It was just blasting things through the air. I mean you probably have to get refilled like a lightning bolt hits your house every time you need more electricity. It's scary. What about a bird? What if a fucking bird was flying by right when you hit the power switch? I don't know. They burns me just exploding off through the sky. All throughout cities. Birds are birds are the collateral damage of the power industry. They're getting killed by wind mills right now, so, but could you imagine if people were just turning on their lights?

Speaker 3:          00:36:17       Switches in. Birds are just exploding. This guy cause of bolts of electricity would come out of your house and connect you to the tree. You know the big metal lightening tree, some poor burb just be in that path. It boom. You tough living for the birds. You'd be walking down the street and birds exploding over your head. Birds would just start walking and they become one of us like a dog or you know, flying. They would read eventually. It's good point. That would eventually realize through evolution, the robots team up with the birds and then we're really screwed. Sort of like how butterfly develops that fake eyeball on his wings to make a prayer. Listen Bitch, I'm looking at you. You know, they're not really looking at their, their stupid butterflies. Yeah. Nature developed that. That was, it became good for that. Designed to exist. You know what a bizarre thing that is and you just stop to think about it.

Speaker 3:          00:37:03       Like how do you explain that? Just they develop eyeballs and their wings, they just happen. There's those pictures. There's some mutation where they have a pattern on their wing that makes them, that reacts with the Predator. The Predator looks at it and goes, that either looks like something I've eaten that tastes horrible or that looks like something bigger than me and it's dangerous. And then that, that butterfly continues on and it happens again and again and again. That's the scientific explanation, but I think there's something nefarious at foot. So I think something is afoot, something studious. I don't trust them fucking butterflies. I don't trust them. They're up to something. They made eyeballs on their wings. I just, I have a hard time believing that was just some sort of a random setting. It's more disturbing as the caterpillar with eyeballs on its, but it like listens ass up and it's got two big eyes on there.

Speaker 3:          00:37:50       I don't like butts looking back at me. I don't want to, I'm not buying it. No. Find ones that have eyeballs. There's a, there's some incredible ones where they, they look like like it looks like cat size. Yeah. That's, it's so weird. It's, it seems like someone's trolling us. I see. It seems like more evidence that the world is made out of magic and somehow or another, some insect is able to develop these camouflage eyeballs on its wings that are just fence. The robot's already took over. We're already experiment now. They're like, we got, we're going to keep giving him something and sooner or later they're going to figure this out. They get the eyeballs, like they've got to figure it out now they've got to know it. Yeah. We just make the world's so preposterous that everybody just stops and goes, wait a minute, what the fuck is going on? And then Dan [inaudible], the music

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       starts playing like the curtain draws and the aliens come out clapping. Well, we didn't think it was going to take you this long guy go, there's no, people were all looking at that. There's the owl eyes. Oh yeah, that's nuts. We're all in the matrix. I've never seen that one before. Harold Brown Matrix. Look at those. I'm like the first reaction I have looking at that, that's gotta be Photoshop is that, that's for as a whole series of them, there's a bunch of different kinds of moths or butterflies rather develop these eyeballs on the, on the back of their wings. So fantastic. I just love the beauty. Yeah, amazing. Like a cat. Those are cat's eyes. That's looks like a tiger. It looks like a baby tiger hiding in the woods. Ready to Jack you so you better step birdie. Don't beat me. I'm a fucking tiger.

Speaker 4:          00:39:22       Frigging amazing. It's incredible. I mean, look, it has eyeballs. If you look in the eye, it looks like, like if you had that tattooed on you and it was an eye, you'd be like, oh, that artist is good. Yeah, that's a good look at that. Get the fuck out of here. Just get the fuck out of here. It's a cartoon fairy. Totally. That's so weird. And that's real. I don't buy that. That's, I mean, I know that's the answer. I know science would tell you that's the answer, but they didn't see it happen. There's no, there's no actual documentation of that particular change. This man chick in the world, my friend as an author, I'm sure you must agree with me, you, you create fantastic works of fiction. You create an entire worlds in your own mind. Well, you get into, you know, the definition of magic can be so broad.

Speaker 4:          00:40:03       And the fact that any one of us being alive at this particular moment is such an astronaut. The odds against you being here and living this long are so astronomical. You can't even calculate it. But here you are. If we were just here a couple of hundred years ago. Yeah. And the fact that we've really only come into our modern day culture in the past two centuries or so. So there's a lot of things I look at as an author are just staggering. And even looking at something like the butterflies, of course, my first reaction is always, what can I do with that? How can I work that into a story? Because that's real and that's cool and we can do something with it. But yeah, there's, there's a lot of things I look at and even having a decent knowledge of science and evolution and those things, you look at it and go, how the fuck could that happen?

Speaker 4:          00:40:47       There's a lot of times I find myself arguing myself like, no, yeah, I'm not. The one that gets me is like the crabs that put crap on their shell. Have you ever seen these things? They put crap on these crabs will grab whatever happens to be around them and then use the their saliva and glue it to their claws like a boxer crat and in the glue it'll glue anatomies, which are deadly to it, onto its claws. So if another Predator comes up, they're like, they put up their dukes, they put up two and enemies, look up boxer crab. If you guys want to show this wards off predators and now you can see that anything with that behavior of course as a survival advantage, that makes sense. But at what point does some crazy crap eat a bad piece of fish and get so high that it's like, I'm gonna go, come gonna cut this off here and put this on a closet and waving around for a little.

Speaker 4:          00:41:33       So I see stuff like that. That's one that always throws me for a loop. Like how did that first actually happen? That and, and you know, when I talked to my science consultants, they break it down into finer and finer detail. Once you say, makes perfect sense. However, he's got frigging seeing enemies on his claws. I'm not buying it, bitch. Look at this. They taught him how to do that. The power, the pump on grab, that's a live in enemy on his claws and anybody screws with them is going to get a mouthful of nomadises that is up to crazy. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:42:04       The ocean itself might as well be an alien world. I mean, it really might as well be on another planet. Yeah. Just stopping. Oh, that's one thing that I really wanted to talk about with the ocean. This is a crazy fucking thing than I just discovered. You know, a sea shepherd, you know, that, uh, those companies that go out and fight those whalers, um, they caught this Japanese whaling ship and the Japanese whaling ship, they have this really sneaky thing they're doing where you are allowed to under some provision, some unilateral agreement. You're allowed to whale hunt. You could take a whale if it's for scientific research. So they left in some weird loophole for scientific research. So what these guys do is they go out and they slaughter these whales and then they say it's for scientific research and they just sell the meat. Like they're wailing it just killing these whales. But the way they're doing it is under this weird loophole.

Speaker 4:          00:43:02       So they're selling some part of the whale, maybe for science and then selling. Now there's a salad.

Speaker 1:          00:43:07       The meat for food. They're selling it as, I mean there's, they're selling it commercially, but you can see the, uh, the photos. Did you see the, uh, the images, Brian, if you go to like sh sea shepherd, uh, one of the more recent stories about it, you could, they have, they took, they've got a helicopter and they flew over the boat and took photos of these dead whales. There it is just sitting on it's dark man. It's really dark. And um, if you look as they pull back and they show you there's a website address and if you go to that website address, there's an English version and an American and a Japanese version. But the, uh, the, the images are pretty shocking if you go and look at it online, they even have video of them slaughtering one of the whales. But to me, when I look at that, that to me is just like us going to another planet and killing some alien being. We would never stand for that. If we showed up on Mars and Mars had wheels on it and we just started gutting whales and using it for scientific research, people would go fucking crazy. Like what are you doing? We found this intelligent life form that communicates, it has a voice, it has language, it has, they have some sort of a weird differentiation between different sections of the world and they have different accents.

Speaker 4:          00:44:18       Yeah. But at the same time, if there's a resource there that we need or someone can make money from and the propaganda machine kicks in and we find this alien intelligence and then your president is on the radio, this is a significant danger to the human race and we have to act right now cause they do all of these horrible things. We've watched it on our planet dozen times in our own lifetime where somebody comes out with a propaganda machine and we're so manipulatable that we'd be like, oh well if we don't bomb them first, they're going to bomb us. We are scared. People get scared. Especially when they have kids. Yeah. Kids, I get real scared and they want to just fucking bomb them. They're dangerous out there. The martians have weapons of mass destruction. We got to take them bitches out. But imagine if we went to Mars, we found some intelligent life forms that communicate with language and we decided to start eating them.

Speaker 4:          00:45:05       Imagine the protest. Imagine how bad people would freak out. But we don't have any problem. The whales, whales pretty much aren't hurting anybody. We've established that they aren't hurting anybody. So not hurting anybody. And smart. We know that. We know those two things for sure. But you know what the thing is? Nature's so evil herself, like nature sets whales up. It makes it so whales can't defend themselves against killer whales. You know? That's why they call him killer whales. A lot of folks don't know that they kill whales. They're not whales or dolphins, but they kill whales. They're in the you, the videos of them killing whales are fucker. Crazy, crazy cause they know it doesn't, they don't do it quick. You know, like they just started eating this, chewing off a hug. I, the one I saw when I was a little kid who was a national geographic and the first time anybody had ever documented an Orca pack taking out a whale could have been, I can't remember what kind of whale it was, gray whale or sperm whale and they literally chew on it until it opens its mouth like in pain and then one swims inside the mouth and starts non down on the tongue.

Speaker 4:          00:46:03       Oh God. Cause that's, and as far as they could tell like that's the good stuff. That's what they actually want is the tongue tastes the best. So somebody gets to go in there and start chewing on that tongue and then they just, they just kill it. It's hard to take their side. That's a cunty fish. Obviously it's hard to take the killer whale side. I mean I would like to take their side, but the way they treat whales is fucked. And then you realize, well you know that's just nature. Nature is just like that. There's going to be, it's going to be horrific crimes. That's what nature is all about. Nature. Nature is an endless fight for survival. And if you aren't killing, then you're going to get killed and yeah, that it goes. And if you have no way of recognizing your culture, if you have no way of objective Lee assessing your, your situation, if you're stuck in a world where you need constant movement, even to breathe, you're constantly, I mean they're, they're carrying a lot of body mass.

Speaker 4:          00:46:54       You need to get fish and they need to feed all the time. So they're constantly in movement. They don't have any time for self reflection. They don't have a fucking couch with a kickback with their pipe and watch masterpiece theater and ponder and write poetry. And then that poetry can be read by others. And if we existed in a world like that, we were just flying around the three dimensional space. I don't think we'd be very much different than dog. Well, we weren't. And it's, it's the development of agriculture and, and society and, and cities and getting that safety that comes in in with a large number of people working together. That's the only thing that's allowed to do those things as well. You go back 40 50,000 years with us and it was, there was no different, we'll kill anything that moves, kill and kill and eat anything that moves, and if you don't do it, something's going to kill you. And it was only the development of society that allowed people to start writing poetry and making art and doing all those other things.

Speaker 1:          00:47:45       Yeah. The development of a place where you can hang out and not get eaten. Yeah. And where you had food stockpiled and you're like, okay, I've got all that covered. Yeah. I got a wall. I got a gun, I got a steak. Okay, I'm good. I got nothing to do for at least the next week. And next thing you know, you're drinking wine and writing things down, and then people read that shit and go, dude, I thought that too, but I just never put it to words. And then the whole culture expands from there. Yeah. That's never going to happen with dolphins. They've got to keep moving ever going to like shit, dolphins, I don't think they're very much different than us. I know. I know. That's a very hippie thing to say, but I had a experience once on a boat with dolphins playing wild dolphins in Hawaii.

Speaker 1:          00:48:22       It changed me for life, changed me for life, just looking in their eyes, experiment, experiencing like laughing with them and yelling at them and them doing tricks for you. I mean they was when they were with us for over an hour and I was high as fuck God damn, I was high, I was so hot. I definitely shouldn't have been on a boat. But there I was. And when you're that high, you're very vulnerable and very sensitive and very, very introspective and almost painfully so sometimes. So me looking in the eyes of though that Dolphin had me absolutely convinced just watching these things play, that I'm probably being extremely prejudice and how highly I value human human cognition and our ability to change our environment being the ultimate measure of intelligence.

Speaker 4:          00:49:06       Well they, they, they couldn't change her environment. They have absolutely no need to because the African adapted to their environment. They're perfect. We don't have to worry about sharks. They don't have to worry about shit. All they have to worry about is those conti killer whales. Whales eat them. That's what's interesting about dolphins. They're one of the few species on the planet that kill for fun because they've got so much brainpower. They're like, I'm just going to go kill that. They'll, they'll kill other dolphins. They'll infanticide. If you know there are baby dolphins that aren't produced by them, they'll kill him. Dolphins, rape, which is messed up, one of the few species, it goes down and raped. So with big brains comes big problems. I guess all species kind of raped. I don't know. I don't think so. No, it's not. It's not a very common, it's not a very common thing.

Speaker 4:          00:49:47       You're heard about the puffer fish right there. The getting high with puffer fish, but like champs to chimps. Rape. The chimps do too. Yeah, they will. Yeah. And what about cats? Can't cause the female cats are too bad ass. That's a dangerous move. I don't think you want to go there. Yeah. Fuck that. You get cut up. He's a fucking her cue. You mentioned tried to rape a lion. You'll get in in pack animals. You'll get drive, it's driving out the Alpha male of the pack and then the new new guys, the Alpha Male, and he gets the spoils of war so to speak. But I don't think there's an enormous amount of of straight up rape in the animal kingdom outside of the hype. More intelligent animal.

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       Well it's also, there's probably no social stigma to fucking, and probably the female tigers want to have sex as well, so there's not as much of a need to fuck or to a rape each other. Doesn't that make sense? Like if wild animals, if it just became real rapey like a rabies, they would never eat anything. They wouldn't get any work done. Right. It could be, you know, speaking out of my ass here, but the dolphin that could be part of that free time thing. That's our whole shows. They don't have anyone in 36 episodes.

Speaker 5:          00:50:49       No significant predators other than humans. They don't even really, they're not even really all that afraid of sharks and they don't have to worry about their environment. The perfectly adapted and they are smart. So they got time to think about stuff like, you know, look at the dorsal fin on that girl. You know, like maybe they think

Speaker 1:          00:51:04       too much welded the killer whales don't give a fuck if they think they'll eat them. Yeah. They go around eating dolphins, they kill everything. Yeah. They're the best. They don't care. They know they're smart and like, so what? Yeah. So you're smart to fuck you so you're not a fish. Oh you so you breathe air. Yeah. It seems like everything's smart breeds they're interesting. Nothing smart figured out gills. Uh, no. It's all my millions. It's all a marine mammals.

Speaker 5:          00:51:32       There's some people who think that the octopus and squids are really wicked smart, like being, being able to be tool users and figure out puzzles significantly. But yeah, that's the only quantic breathing animal that I can think of.

Speaker 1:          00:51:45       Here's the problem with that argument. They don't have any houses and they get eaten by fish. Yeah. That's ridiculous. Not that fucking smart. They're not that smart. So they know how to open a jar. Whoa. Fucking now can teach a dog to open the jar, close the lid behind you and you're home free. God is not hard. I'm a three year old can open a fucking jar. Right. That's so stupid. Think that they are super intelligent. They have also ability to communicate with their skin, which I find incredibly fast. Amazing to watch. That's just nuts. The visual communication, they, they, they used to think at one time that was just camouflage that they were just adapting to their environment, which they also capable of doing it, but they also somehow or another communicate with each other by their skin, by the way they look and they think that that squid ink may be, it serve two purposes. It may one, try to ward off predators in some way, create confusion and allowed to escape, but also might be like eraser fluid. Like, forget what I just said. That's all bullshit. Let's just wipe that out. Yeah. There's some interesting work done on, on the octopus and Octopi commune.

Speaker 5:          00:52:47       Uh, I don't know if you've ever seen videos of cuddle fish hunting but using the patterns in their body to hypnotize their pray. But I, I've got a book called EarthCorps fiction book and the whole race in that book is based on the cuddle fish. So all of their communication is almost non. There's almost no verbal, it's all visual and it's the patterns changing on their skin would just how they talk to each other and how they hunt as a pack. Wow. Yeah, it's pretty, pretty sweet. It's pretty sweet. That's

Speaker 1:          00:53:12       so why I wonder how wolves communicate. Like when wolves decided to going to sneak up on somebody, like if they do something, like if they have a situation like wolves, like they'll corner an animal. Like they'll have like some, some will go this and others we'll wait for

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       him on the other end like this somehow or another communicate with each other. Well that's, that's probably of all the six we did this and it worked so, but they are, they are smart as shit and they are capable of remembering. Okay. You guys got do you guys got the rounder roll? Make sure they don't blank out. They don't flank out to the side. Here's the guys pushing and then yeah, these things have cascading color on their body. What do you think they do it with though? I mean are they doing it with this when they're talking about wolves and doing it with smells or using pheromones, like how would they communicate? They, from what I know about it, they're actually, they teach the puppies and the young ones how to do it, like teaching. They're like, you're going to go here or they will follow the adult and they look.

Speaker 3:          00:54:07       It's a learned skill. It's just like a pack of humans hunting and they, they, they, they're brought up like your role is this and then as they become more dominant in the pack, they changed their role in the hunting pack. You've seen them, I'm sure you've seen the video of the chimpanzees organizing an armed party to go after monkeys. No, I don't think I've seen this so crazy. It's, it's one of the weirdest videos. And it was one of the first instances where they were completely sure that chimpanzees were not just vegetarians, where they knew the chimpanzees were not just carnivorous, but they were eating primates. And you've seen that Brian, we ever showed that video? I think so. We'll show the video of the chimpanzee eating a monkey cause it's, it's fucked. Just wondering the team of two. Yes. BBC from the BBC. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:54:52       So they, um, they have all these monkeys in the trees and what they do is they send chimps after them to chase him and they start, you know, like swinging on the trees and then on the other end they have chimps waiting as the monkeys tried to escape. So they've heard them into this area where these dominant chimps, we'll be waiting and the chimps will, uh, attack the monkeys in the trees, but they, the corner them and trap them. They have like, they get him on the sides and they get him in the front and they corral them into an area where other chimps are waiting. And then they grabbed him. They figured that out like how did they organize that? Do they talk about it? How do they know? How do I know there's going to be people on the other end or chimps on the other end waiting when I chased these monkeys down, that's pretty advanced.

Speaker 3:          00:55:36       That's super advanced. They've somehow or another figured out a way to talk to each other and say, look man, I want to eat a monkey. You guys when to eat some lunch. This is how we do it. They hide in the trees. We got to do is chase him down there and Mike and Bob, you guys will stand on the corners, chase him this way and then a Tommy at the end. It's just going to gather them all up. I'm going to eat. That's a killer question. How do they communicate that? That would take people like if a bunch of random people were stranded on a deserted island and they had to figure out how to hunt, it would take them until like they were on the brink of starvation till they figured that out. They'd be like, well, let's go try and get some food. And, but we took a long fucking time, really strategies, a trippy thought with that to me is not knowing how long they've been exhibiting this behavior. That's exactly how they catch monkeys and orangutans and chimpanzees. So was somebody watching the humans do this and go, that shit works great. I don't think so, but it might because it's like we have a lot of evidence

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       to them killing chimpanzees before and they might literally a developed that from watching how we do it to them, which is fun. It's crazy. Most likely though that they're just smart and they figured you're smart if you got that video.

Speaker 2:          00:56:35       Yeah. A Jimmy just told me that, uh, that's the video that every time we played that they yank. I saw youtube though. Oh really? What we could show grape ape and a monkey

Speaker 1:          00:56:43       that's very realistic. They Yank us off youtube just for that. Yeah. That was a BBC One fucking BBC. It's the Internet bitch. You're never going to win. You're never gonna beat the Internet. But, um, the mean the way they treat monkeys and the way we treat whales, the way we treat killer whales, it, it really is a perplexing question. Like what will the next thing, how will that treat us if there is an artificial artificial intelligence, super genius robot that becomes some sort of a synthetic organic thing that's almost indistinguishable from humans but infinitely smarter? How is it going to deal with us? You know, is it going to deal with us the way we deal with the chimps or the way the chimps did with the monkeys are the way we deal with the dolphins or the way the killer whales deal with the dolphins?

Speaker 1:          00:57:28       How's it going to deal with, they're not setting a very good precedent. Why would he want to keep us around and make us be lazy, Shitty, unproductive workers that are really angry that our robot overlords have taken over? Or there's just the basic problem with work. We're too smart. Would you want to keep some if the, if we had monkeys in the La area and they walked around with switchblades and guns and every now and then we'd start killing people. He'd be like, we gotta get rid of those monkeys. And you know, this is a funny conversation because whenever you have this conversation about artificial intelligence, you're going to get a lot of naysayers and a lot of people that claim that they know what's going to happen. Like, listen, that's not going to happen. We would never allow it. We would never engineer that.

Speaker 1:          00:58:05       We would never, I get ya, I get ya. However, it might have been, that guy would never allow it. That guy, whenever engineering, there's always somebody out there who's just either for the money or it's like, God, I wonder if I can do that. That's the driving force behind discoveries. I wonder if I can make that happen. And this insatiable need to push technology. Just insatiable. The drive that people have to to continue to innovate is spectacular. Every day there's some new goddamn hundred 10 inch TV. That's 44 k Michael Bay. Yeah. What happened with that Michael Bay was doing, he was doing a presentation and the prompter fail and he locked up.

Speaker 2:          00:58:46       It is he, he couldn't even just wing it like he could eat. Like all he had to do is talk about what he does as a director. Like I make movies and he tried to do it, but then he stopped and then the guy's like, you know, why don't we just talk about these new TVs? You know, these curved TVs? And he could have just said, yeah, they look beautiful or something, but instead he starts mumbling and then just wa and goes, excuse me,

Speaker 1:          00:59:04       it's on stage. Oh, so he bombed. He got panicky and happens. Happens to the best of us. I don't want to watch some really creepy. That's all good to see. It's like, it's like watching a really bad comedian right before you go on stage. Like if someone's up there just bombing and then you have to go on stage. You don't think could be funny. It's dangerous for you if you get a sniff of his craziness. Some guys like t petrified, you might think of that. That might like enter into your head. It's like a single cell and start dividing like a little virus, a little mental virus. Very dangerous. That can take your performance down. Most likely. No, but I don't like the feeling. I don't like watching. Like I don't like watching people bomb. It's, it feels gross. Yeah, I know what it feels like.

Speaker 1:          00:59:47       I've got to get out of there. You know? I don't think it's very hard to go on after. This is why I think it's a, it might actually be affecting people and this is also why I think people enjoy inspiration. I think when you see someone who's really bad, you really don't think that anything's good. You think like, this is what life is. Life is like really terrible. Life is terrible comedy. Someone's bombing on stage and on the opposite, when you see something really spectacular, it raises your standards for things that you could accomplish, things that you could be excited to see it. It raises your standards. If you go to see Avatar, so some spectacular movie, it's, you leave that, you would think it would be the inverse of that. Oh, I want to follow the guy who bond. Even if I phone it in, I'm going to do well and I don't want to follow avatar because it's spectacular and I'm going to look for ha.

Speaker 1:          01:00:35       Well, some people do have that, that mindset. Some people have this really ultra competitive mindset and they, uh, like a lot of comics like to bring terrible comedians with them on the road. They bring guys who just really shouldn't even be going on stage. And the comic is like really pretty good. So it'd be like this death show for 20 minutes and then the comment comes in like a hero and everybody's super excited to see him. I've seen that happen on numerous occasions, but that's famine mentality, that famine mentality, that there's not enough for everybody, that the famine mentality that, you know, you have to get all the accolades and anybody that's threatening whatsoever to your, you know, your talents, your abilities. So it should be just minimalized. Hmm. You know, that's a, that's a dangerous mindset to have in a, especially in the world of comedy.

Speaker 1:          01:01:20       No, but I think, uh, if you instead choose to be inspired by good performances, then everything becomes inspirational. It's not like everything's competitive. Instead of it being competitive, you get all the same juice that you would get from the competitive aspect of it, but you get it in a positive form. Instead you're inspired and happy for people. Success, happy for great movies, happy for great music, happy for great comedy. When you see great things inspired by them, so everywhere around you, you see inspiration instead of everywhere around you. You seeing competition, people doing better than you, something that diminishes your, your idea of who you are as a person because you don't measure up on paper to Michael Bay or this guy or that guy. Instead of that, it's the opposite. You know, the mentality is you're constantly being inspired. Just a, it's a matter of engineering your thoughts. That's all. It really got significant. I've had, it's better now, but I've had significant issues with other authors. You know what? The people start out, same time I did roughly

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       and have similar, similar career arcs moving up. And then they just catch lightening by the tail for something and the next thing you know, they're huge. And I'm like, we're basically working equally. Everybody's working their fingers to the bone like every other profession. Anybody who succeeds anywhere, it's probably working their ass off. And then you just watch them blow up and you're like, that's, that's difficult to overcome. You're like, oh, that guy got all the goodies that guy got there first. Um, and you know, hockey these for you? Oh yeah. Yeah. And it's like you say, it's a lot, a lot of it has been adjusting the perspective. You have to step back and say, I'm still doing really well and I'm making a lot of people really happy with my stories and my books and I can now aspire to get to that level.

Speaker 4:          01:03:00       So I have to write something better and market it better and connect better and finally get that out there. Well, I think sometimes it's just a matter of people finding out about it. It's really that simple. It's like the product is there for a long time, but there's so much product you walk into, Barnes and noble, start roaming through the fiction section, find a bunch of authors you don't know when you read the back of the book and you see a few recommendations that you probably respect too. I fuck it, I'll take a chance. But for the most part they're, the choices are endless and new books are coming out constantly. It's difficult to get scenes difficult to get discovered and that the, the exposures is the biggest thing and people hearing about what you do and then maybe hearing two or three times for, they're familiar with like this is my second time in the show and the first time we got a ton of new readers, people are like, God, that guy sounds pretty cool to me.

Speaker 4:          01:03:46       Check out his books and we've got all these fans now. Now in the second time maybe you get more and you know all of that effort. The next book's out, it's called pandemic. It's out January 21st and just trying to get people exposed to it so that they can say, that sounds like my cup of tea or, yeah, I don't think I'd be interested in that. That's the real game. It's not getting people to read or forcing people to read it. It's just a matter of if nobody's ever heard of me, they don't get the opportunity to make that decision if my stuff is a is in their alley or not. Does that get in the way at all of the creative process for you? Is it like an unwanted annoyance, like this extra thing of trying to promote and trying to figure out how to promote and then would it be easier for you if you could get past that and get to this like Stephen King point where any oil you have to do is just write shit, dude.

Speaker 4:          01:04:33       You know, anybody getting to the Anne Rice, Stephen King, Dean Koontz, you know, uh, any of those levels where they just flat out, he doesn't have to worry about anymore. Stephen King could give a crap about marketing because that's all going to get taken care of for him. And He's, he's earned that and he's totally fine. Yeah. But uh, so we do, yeah, we, I put a lot of time in a marketing and trying different things, um, to, to get the word out and all of that. Every minute I spent doing that as a minute. I'm not creating or refining a story. Like one of the things we did today was for all of the listeners, remember that book I told you about last time title fight, which was the science fiction MMA. We decided we're just going to give that away to all your listeners through January. If they go to our website.

Speaker 4:          01:05:15       I'm Scott sigler.com oh, it's up on the screen, right? Who was that? That was not a fighter. No, that's the one you said you asked me if I was writing gay porn last time. That's right. That's right. That looks like who smaller par Horez there's a couple of guys that looked like that, but mark, Mark Coleman used to look like that to some extent. No, he wasn't even that big. He huge, if anybody goes to that store and puts that in their cart and then uses the code death squad, they get that ebook for free. Beautiful, beautiful read on their computer. They can read it on their tablet and their kindle, etc. Awesome. So these are the kinds of things that, and it's not like, you know the Stephen Kings in the Joe Hill's don't still do, or their people do that marketing stuff for them. But yeah, we have to do things like that to be like, just like, I know if you read my shit, I'm going to own you. It's just that simple. Pull up

Speaker 1:          01:06:02       Mark Kerr, mark curves the only MMA fighter that really looked like that. They actually did a fascinating documentary on mark courage. No, I have the smashing machine. It's called the smashing machine. It is fucking dark. It's deep because mark was like super, super open with them and they're like, while he was filming this documentary, they were doing this documentary on this unstoppable MMA fighter. This guy who was this wrestler who was just destroying people. He's built like a fucking superhero super athlete, taking people down and smash them. No, that's when he's fat. You've got to get him when he's young. You got to get him when he's young. Mark her huge. Just find, find an image of him when he was just unbelievably huge. So anyway, this documentary, they start doing this documentary and along the lines, the, it exposes his drug use and he's opened when he shoots up right in front of these people and they capture this guy completely spiraling out of control.

Speaker 1:          01:06:54       They just come into the right moment as they're filming this documentary and catch this guy who was like one of the best fighters in the world, completely spiraling on camera shooting up. You got to just get a picture of him when he was in his prime. There's a, you know, there's some photos of him like fighting in the UFC. Yeah, that's, that's him. Holy Cow. Oh, that doesn't work. Look at the size of that motherfucker that, I mean, that was, that was when they were calling them the smashing machine. He was 265 pounds of American muscle and Mexican supplements. And he was some mashing people, but along the way developed a, an addiction too. I believe it was opiates. I think it was shooting up. Look out fucking big. He was, dude, are you shitting me?

Speaker 4:          01:07:39       And did he just kind of take himself out or did he get beat and go?

Speaker 1:          01:07:42       He started going down. I started getting beat, you know, well he was doing drugs, you know, he's having like a real drug problem and he was fighting while he was a addicted to drugs. Okay. And then, yeah, I think he eventually went and became a car salesman. But the, um, I think it's an important documentary. It's an important, not just from the point of view of someone who, um, is, uh, having a serious problem with drugs, but it's all steroids. He had a, you know, he's absolutely on massive amounts of steroids. Yeah. He was also fighting and MMA, which is the thing about traumatic brain injuries and punches and kicks it you take, it's like

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       sometimes the of damage can lead these guys to be like really depressed and suicidal and crazy if they sustained too much damage, if they're not really careful about it. If they don't give themselves enough time to recover, they can get really depressed. So here's this guy taking shots to the head all the time, taking morphine or heroin or whatever the fuck is taking, you know? And they caught him in this doc. Perfect, perfect timing for right when it all fell apart. They came in thinking he was the baddest motherfucker on earth and they left with this really in depth piece on a guy whose life is being absorbed by drugs. Drugs are just stealing his life, just taking it in little pieces, you know? And he wound checked that out. He wound up fighting later in his career like no steroids, no drugs, completely different body looked like a guy just stepped out of a bar.

Speaker 3:          01:09:03       It was really strange. How did he do at the end? Is he still terrible? It's getting destroyed. Oh Geez. Um, pull up a picture of mark her fat. I don't want, I liked the guy. I'm not teasing him. I mean this is just the reality of who he was at the end. Look at him. That's what he looked like at the end. Wow. Yeah. Quite a difference. Yeah. Oh, the before and after. It was incredible and a, I saw him fight a couple times live when he was in that state and I saw him fight live when he was the destroyer. You know, it was shocking, really shocking stuff. But uh, you know, that world is shocking. It's a crazy world. The world with your body. Do you think eventually they're going to get to the point where, cause usually guys are losing their three of their last four of their last three years and then they retire.

Speaker 3:          01:09:47       Is it going to get to a point where you know you have, so he's going to step in and be like, yeah, we're just going to go ahead and make a decision for you all? They certainly have. They've done that in many fighters. Yeah. Yeah. They've retired quite a few fighters. Chocolate. Dell is the most obvious example because he was like one of the greatest champions ever and Dana and him at very good friends and at the end of Chuck's career, Chuck asks for one more fight and wonder if I rich Franklin. He lost that fight and he's like, that's it. We're good. That's it. I got to step away. And so he realized it was time. The Arnold Arnold's 62 it look like that now. He also is a training for the Conan movies. Kona King cone in finally. Yes. Oh that's right. You're a Robert Howard fan.

Speaker 3:          01:10:29       Yeah. Can we talk about Robert Howard last time when I don't. I don't think so, but that, that, that was my goal ever of watching the first two Conan movies and even red stone back in the day. I'm like, I want to write king cone and I never got to the point where I could talk to anybody, have any contacts. I'm like, that movie's got to get made cause it's perfect. Now he's the perfect age for it. It can be spectacular. Yeah. Folks don't know that Robert E. Howard made Conan in many different areas. It wasn't just a young, virile, powerful Conan. He also made King Conan when Conan was the king of scenarios is I think so. W opponent. The Sumerian? Yeah. Well he was the Samarian, but I don't think he was a king of that. I think he took over some new place. I don't remember. I don't remember.

Speaker 3:          01:11:06       Yeah, they were great fucking books though. Those, those books sort of in my mind, like kind of defined my childhood. I really got fast fascinated with fantasy and that kind of shit. It was, it was the Robert E. Howard books crawl, was it called a conqueror? Conquer. Yeah. That was so good. Yeah. Cyclops in that movie. The movie was just, uh, a shit version of the books. Really? The books. Yeah. The movie is fine, but it's probably dated now. If you've probably watched it now, you'd hate it. Well, at the moment, yeah, I don't, I don't go back and watch some movies. The movies, the Scifi movies I loved, and I was a kid with the exception of like Predator and aliens just don't watch them anymore. You can't ruins everything. You really can't. But Robert Howard created some amazing Conan books that never really have been captured correctly.

Speaker 3:          01:11:52       They try, they did a little bit better with the new Conan, the new guy. Oh yeah, like I think the new guy is, first of all. Yeah. Yeah. Way More realistic. Way more like the actual Qa. Like he's an enormous guy. Like he's not billing a bodybuilder. He's bill. Go to the new Conan guy, Jason Momoa, who's, I've met a minimum of UFC two very nice guy, and he's fucking huge. This kid is like six foot six. It's just this perfect specimen of manhood. He's never gonna make it out alive. He's gonna fuck so much that he's going to die. There's, there's no way he can avoid it. If I was here like Jason Momoa, he fucked himself to death to death. He's six foot six and he's a beautiful man and he's a movie star. There was no way he doesn't have, there's no way he gets it together.

Speaker 3:          01:12:33       Look at that it get the fuck out. Get the fuck Outta here. Come on. That kind of didn't, I didn't watch the news because they just didn't want the old one to be, I didn't want them to sell a, the original Coney, because I'm a giant fan of them. They only sullied it in like half the movie. You could just cut out half the movie and have that movie, have no ending and like it was a good effort. It was a good attempt. I think ultimately what Kona and needs and deserves is that guy is the perfect Kona and he's a good actor. He looks like a savage. Keep that, keep him as the Kona and just get a real writer who's a real fucking crazy person who can come up with something bad ass and follow the robbery Howard script. Follow what that guy and then do it through the eyes of like a real visionary.

Speaker 3:          01:13:19       Get a real James Cameron type dude or how about Martin Scorsese does Konan how about you? You have a movie where it's like a really dark fantasy movie that plays out like a real film instead of plays out like some bullshit comic. That's always the thing that's confused the crap out of me with the marvel, the crappy marvel movies that made when I was a kid, like why or the the old Spiderman TV show when I was a little kid. I'm like, I'm like, when is he going to fight a super villain? I don't give a shit if he's stopping bank robbers and it was, it never made any sense to me. That's like comic books. Tell these stories that are massively popular. Why don't you just tell that story? Why do you think you have to reinvent everything? And the Kona and books will be a similar thing. Like this already entertained a large percentage of the planet at one time. It's not dated because there's no, you know, 19th century technology. It's tell the same frigging story. Yeah. Tell the story and now with the new technology, the fucking monsters saying, did you see the hobbit? No, I haven't seen to have it yet. Oh yeah, that dragon is worth seeing the whole movie. Just to see that dragon.

Speaker 5:          01:14:22       That reminds me, that's what I want it to. I haven't seen it, but one of the funniest things ever is when news reporters have to talk about that movie because that, that Smaug snuggled up next it distillations of [inaudible] and the [inaudible]. I want to tell you the sense that since the law, speaking of monsters, because we're closing in on the option for nocturnal, one of my books that's going to be done by Lloyd 11 as a TV show and he's the guy that did Hellboy and Hellboy two fucking dude knows, knows his monsters like nobody's business, but amazing. Congratulations. Thank you. But this happened because of your show. We had, uh, one of your listeners name is Nikki Monta, my gosh. Darn it. [inaudible] is that right now? Yeah. Nicky Ahmond, she works for a alumnae, Lucy Steele. I who's an agent at the paradigm agency in New York. So I was on your show.

Speaker 5:          01:15:13       Mickey heard it and said, wow, that nocturnal sounds really cool and reads it, and then it goes, goes to her boss and says, I think this is significant. You need to read it. Her boss reads it. Lucy reads it. Contacted my print agent. We were done with our current film agent at the time. We'd worked together five years. Great Guy, but we didn't make anything happen. So time to change something. So we talked, Lucy, Lucy takes over and now we're almost not only almost closed on nocturnal, but then the the guys, the people who make a justified an elementary are closing and an option for the infected series, which pandemic is the last book. That's incredible. This lady's kicking ass and it came because of Niki listening to your show. That's incredible. Cut to three years from now. It's like God's on coke laying in his mansion and his underwear doing a new red. Sonja remake was Miley Cyrus? Yes. Smashing. Look, a champagne bottle on the ground because there's nothing left. There's my fucking drank. So just a quick thank you out to Nikki if she's listening to this because just one person listening to it, running up the tree as a, you know, change a lot of things for us.

Speaker 3:          01:16:19       That's all it takes, right? I mean, like I said, your product is amazing. I've gotten nothing but positive responses from people that read your book. After that, you came on the podcast for some time. Do you just, people need to find out about it. So now they go. Good. That's going to be crazy man. Well if we get, you know, and of course either one of the TV shows could not happen, which is how things work in Hollywood. But if he gets super rich, you're going to buy a ball or spot in San Francisco. Oh yeah. You kidding? Well I don't hold block. I don't know about San Francisco, but if you get super rich you could buy basically Roman small country in Michigan and call it Detroit cause it's already named. He could buy the whole thing. But again, you'd have to be in Detroit and be cold as hell.

Speaker 3:          01:16:54       Yeah. All their castles built in the middle of San Francisco. You know, you're pretty sweet, you know, like you've ever been to Stephen King's place? No. Main nope. When I used to work in main ways to stand up, we used to do a Gig in Bangor and you couldn't go to Bangor without driving by Stephen King's house. He had to to know that's where Stephen King labs. Right, right, right. Cause like he had this giant cast doubt on mark. Mark Twain's will house and he by Mark Twain Says Daddy, I think that's smart planes house. I'm not sure about Mark Twain lived in Maine. I could be wrong. I, it's what I've heard. But continuing continue. Well, um, he has like, you can tell it's his house. He has this a rod iron fence outside of his house and he's like gargoyles and shit on it. Oh sweet. Pretty obvious to anybody comes by.

Speaker 3:          01:17:31       Well it's a big house too. It's, you know, but it's not ridiculous. Like he doesn't, he doesn't have like a castle. He lives in a nice big house and he doesn't have any seven rooms or something like that. Not really. I mean it's a very nice house, but it's nothing crazy. Like I guess that's how he fits in up there. Cause you know Bangor is a fairly modest environment and for fairly modest city. That's his house. Yeah. Nice. So you drive by and you see this metal fence with the gargoyles on it. See if he can get a photo of the, the, the alliance, I wonder about that is he's got some crazy fans and that's 20 feet from the sidewalk to the front door. So you wonder if Steve, some of Stephen King's money goes to, there's a couple of dudes lurking around that property at all times.

Speaker 3:          01:18:11       There's, you know, if you jumped that fence, that's your ass. I would have, I would have for sure evil dogs everywhere. Everywhere. I would hire ninjas to just practice on people. Come up with a fence, dudes with swords. I wouldn't fuck around guys on the roof. See the roof, crossbows silence. Just poison Arrow Samurai in the front porch just announced that this is what's going to happen to you. That's what the fuck I'm talking about. Yeah, but it devil Zombie. Samurais but he would have, that'd be a, actually, that's the name of my next book is Samurai Hooker. Yeah. Scott Sigler. Cause you need that heart of gold in there to sell the book, right? Yeah. You can't just have a devil's Zombie Samurai. Who am I rooting for it? They're all cunts. You have a country, country, country. If you have it, you know. Harte gold extra x hooker.

Speaker 3:          01:18:57       Yeah. Now you're, now you're talking, there's a good story there. She did it because her dad had cancer. How about that? That's why she did it. She needed money. Her Dad is, games are against that. Camera it against Zombie. Plus. What's really wrong with hookers? Let's stop. Let's leave them alone. Yes, yes. No, I have no problem with this issue. Well there it is. So that's how uh, the Scott Sigler legend was launched. Yes. And apparently you already know how it's going to end with the Zombie Samurai Hooker and a smash champagne bottle and a baller pan and San Francisco. It could end like that or the artificially intelligent robots could take over first. And we have high, if I get rich, the first thing to do, he is investing in Google so they don't kill me. Yeah. And concrete because the robots are going to eat concrete. Remember?

Speaker 3:          01:19:35       Okay, thank you. Okay, great. Building a lot of concrete around here you go boys. I'll be over here. I wonder if it would be, I mean Google by all, if you know, you know, you look at what they've done, they don't seem to have done anything evil. They seem to be very conscientious, very rich and wealthy, but also very conscientious. You always hear about how great their campuses and how people will work there. Really enjoy the environment. Like this is a, there's a guy works at Google who's a guy, but in the daytime he decided he wants to be a woman. So he shows up at work, dressed as a woman and changes at

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       the end of the day and goes home and he's a man again and they, so they changed his name at work. They totally accepted it. And the Guy Guy's married and has kids and he's a wife. You know he's at, he has a wife and when he gets home he becomes a man again, but while he's at work, he decided that he wants to be a woman. They're like, okay. It doesn't surprise

Speaker 5:          01:20:23       from what I know of Google, that doesn't surprise me. Like, do you still get your work?

Speaker 1:          01:20:26       Yeah, we could give a shit. I don't care. I think it's good. As long as he's not crazy, it doesn't even fucking dwell on it. It's weird. Secret world of men who dress like dolls and think that's the same story. That's equally creepy. That one Google might be, yeah, we're going to have to have a meeting about this robot mass dressing up like the doll is distracting, so let's have, let's have a meeting. Yeah. That's way creepier dressing up like a woman. It's like, okay. Guess you wanted to know, you know? Have you ever had the fantasy? What would you do if you could be a woman for a day? Apparently work at Google. Yeah. That's what you can do a little and put a mask on or be, it would be a fake robot. People are fucking weird man. The things that people enjoy, you know, whatever floats hour long. As long as getting hurt. Exactly. Yeah. As long as you're not being an asshole. When you start writing a book, do you, do you like sit down and it's like say, okay, I want to figure out something to write about or do you just have like a flash of inspiration and then you know, record it, write it down and then take off with it? Like how do you, how do you start a buck?

Speaker 5:          01:21:33       I, mine is much is more structured, so the, the ones I write for random house, um, they're thrillers with a lot of horror and Psi Phi in them. But the thriller structure is, you know, things are planned out to get to this really crazy over the top ending. So a lot of times I'll have the concept, then I'll try and work through a loose structure to come up with an ending that's going to be just balls out spectacular. And then sort of work backwards from there. So if I do that correctly, if I reverse outline it correctly by the time and go from, this is insane, I would never buy into this too. This is a guy having a cup of coffee at his kitchen table in the morning. It feels like a seamless transition. You never noticed that your grant, I'm gradually upping the level of madness to get to that crazy end and you're just fully hooked and believing every moment of it.

Speaker 5:          01:22:19       So it's mostly structured. I don't think I, I don't think I have an immediate just right and then let it go and see where the story goes cause I need to have, you know, 30 or 40 threads that all funneled towards that last ending. Even pandemic, which is the third book in a series. It goes infected than contagious. Then pandemic. Um, each of those three books has a relatively calm beginning and, uh, earth shattering end. But they are complete story unto themselves simply because I don't, I don't believe in extorting fans out of their money. You get a full story for this book. If you don't want to read the next book, you don't have to buy that to see what happens at the end of the first bucket. I don't just cut it in half. So for pandemic it was, it's largely the end of pandemics. Just ape shit crazy. It's the whole world screwed. And you had to come up with, how do I do this

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       much damage and then work it back from there. So it all feels like it flows together naturally. When you talked to other authors, is there like several different schools of thought as far as creating a story? Cause I know Stephen King Oil, which I found really fascinating. His book on writing. Did you read it? Yep. Really like a Bible. It's great. Really, really good book. Well, what I found fascinating is that he doesn't have a structure at all. Nope. He just starts riding. I heard an interview with um, uh, a writer named Joe Abercrombie, interviewed George Rr Martin, the game of Thrones, author Joe Abercrombie's stuff you like fantasies ridiculously good. And of course George Rr Martin's game of Thrones. And George R. Martin described it. I don't know if he came up with this, but this is where I heard it. He said there's two kinds of writers. There's the Gardner and there's the architect, and he's a gardener.

Speaker 4:          01:23:47       And Stephen King, our Gardner, where they put the seed in the ground and they cultivate it. Then they just let it grow wherever it grows. I like this, fine. I'm gonna follow this fine. I liked this flower would follow this flower, whereas the architect, which is more like, you know, Tom Clancy or my stories, you, you'd blueprint and then you build the foundation. Then you build a framework, and then gradually, okay, now we're gonna put in dry electrical. Now we're going to put in plumbing, now we're going to put it in dry wall, and now we're going to finish it. Now we're going to paint it. You know what it's going to look like before it's done. But there's all the work to make it complete. So those are the two kinds of writers and king's definitely in the, in the Gardner. Righty. He just lets us shit roll.

Speaker 4:          01:24:21       That's fascinating. Um, have you ever tried to do it that way or do you enjoy the structure aspect of it? Like have you thought about doing it different ways? I mostly enjoy the, the tetris game of getting it all to come out. And it's really a love hate relationship because if you're as anal retentive about like this has to, you have to feel closure at the end of this book and a half to tie up all the threads when you do that, as you're working through some of the characters, change who they are and all of a sudden you're like, okay, now this guy would never do this thing. He would never go into the haunted house alone. He just wouldn't do it. And then you got to say, I, how do I get around that? And usually break stuff so you have to tear the building down and go back and build it up all over again.

Speaker 4:          01:25:01       And when I do that, uh, with the book nocturnal, I was just talking about my business partner. Uh, a Kovacs had to deal with me. I was, I was miserable for like six months cause I wrote three full dress and at the end of every full draft I'm like, this just, this doesn't work. This is not believable. I could not get through this book and go, that's what, that's what would happen. So I had to rip it all down and start over and move all the parts round again. And I never thought I would get, I was like, I'll never get this right. This will never work out with this concept that I have. And I finally got it to work with some great help from Julian Puffy, who's my editor at random house. We finally got it figured out, but it was, I was freaking miserable.

Speaker 4:          01:25:37       So I would like, eventually I want to get to the gardener face. I just, wherever it goes, it doesn't matter. Let's just have fun. Do you get mad when you read a book that's kind of Piss poor from an author that you really respect? Totally. Yeah. That's a foot like there's so many authors in so many books right now. I am this. Why work so hard to make my stuff so tight and so refined? It's very admirable. I like how you approach it. Well it's, I look at it from the customer's point of view. If you drop 24 bucks on own book and you can tell I phoned it in, you're not coming back cause I'm not coming back. If I read your book and I'm like, this is the lace, yours being so lazy and you took my money and you didn't work for it, I'll never read that author again.

Speaker 4:          01:26:11       Or you've, you've completed the work. It's not that anybody who's being lazy, but sometimes there's a puzzle that people just don't have the effort to solve, but it's not that they're not working hard, they just didn't, they didn't complete it or they're under deadline and now I understand more. Like when I was younger I was much more adamant like fuck you for taking my money. You Lazy Bastard. Now I understand like, yeah, there's a, there's an ax at the back of your neck saying, we've got to get this book to press right now. If you want to get it out by December. Yeah, for Christmas. You have to. Yeah. So that's what people go through a lot. When you think, when you think you've read a shotty work, a lot of times it's, they just ran out of time. They didn't have time to do it.

Speaker 4:          01:26:44       I think it's very cool though that you think like that. I think it's very cool that you think about the, uh, the audience and the people buying. I think that's super important. It adds an element of a, you have a connection with them. You're not above them, you're not beyond them. You're part of them. They need them. You appreciate them and then you respect them as you're writing. You consider them. I think that's big it in this, maybe this is from being a big reader before the ebooks set, but it wasn't that long ago, you know, to to buy the new Stephen King Book for seven 95 and paperback seven 95 was a chunk of money. You're like, okay, I want this and I'm buying this and better be good. And then not Stephen King but somebody else. You buy a book and you're like, I didn't get my money's worth and I worked hard for that money.

Speaker 4:          01:27:22       I've never forgot what that feels like. And even though I'd still give all my stuff away, everything you can get on my website, it's [inaudible] dot com serialized books for free or@patiobooks.com and everything I've published, we give away for free as a serialized audio book. We run advertising against it and we listen to the ad at the beginning of the show, just like your show. Then you get 30 40 minutes an episode. You don't have to pay for anything and let's do it all you want. It's brilliant. Lot of people, a lot of people can't afford, they flat out can't afford books, but they want their story. So that's how they get it. So we do it that way. And then if you actually buy the book, my goal is always you would have paid twice what you paid for it and you're still happy. That's beautiful, man.

Speaker 4:          01:27:58       That's a great way of looking at things. I love the fact that you give everything away for free to put some ads on it. Who gives a shit, you know? As long as it doesn't interrupt, interrupt the flow of the book. Right? Was just like this, this podcast. We never do an ad inside the podcast, but don't want to interrupt the flow of the conversation. But I think giving people something for free is important because it's nice, it's nice to do. It's a nice, it makes people feel good that they can get your good stuff for free. They can go to Scott sigler.com they could start downloading your audio books, get hooked, have many, many, many more hours of entertainment for fucking free. And then we knew stuff comes out. They want to support you. Yup, exactly. That's organic and a lot of, a lot of times what happens is people have, a lot of people have money to spend on entertainment and they don't mind spending that money on entertainment if they know they're going to get something good. What pisses people off is a spend their money and then on something and then find out that they don't actually like the product. So if I give these stories away, you know, that's my competitive advantage over Stephen King. If you go into a bookstore and see Scott Sigler and Stephen King, and you've never heard of me, you're gonna by Stephen King because a proven brand,

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       he's a proven storyteller. But if you go to the bookstore in Stephen King's 24 95 and Scott's hagglers free, maybe I'll try this first, then go get the Stephen King. Now I've got a chance for people to try out my stuff, and if they listened to a couple of books and they know what they're getting from then on, then they, they buy everything that comes out today. It comes up. Yeah. And you, you miss the viral aspect when you charge people for things like, um, do you know, uh, the, there's La has a radio team. Uh, it used to be frosty Heidi and frank, and now it's just Heidi and frank. Really Nice folks. Very, very fun people. I've done their show a couple times and they were on the radio and they went from the radio to doing a podcast, but they, they were making their money by charging for the podcast.

Speaker 1:          01:29:43       And so they had a good piece of change. It was coming in every month, but they couldn't grow. They couldn't grow because no one can find out about them because it just doesn't, people don't, when you go, hey, there's this team, you know, Mike and fucking pissed face, and they, uh, they have an awesome podcast, but it costs two bucks. Trust me. It's worth it. You're like, how good could it be? I can go download Adam Carolla. I'll go download Joey Diaz. Why would I bother spending two bucks or something that I can get for free? That's where it gets weird when there's just too much. The Internet, it's gotta be free. Everything's gotta be free. If it's not free, it's not going to work. It's just there's too much that it's free. That's too many options. Like you've got to find another way to monetize things.

Speaker 1:          01:30:19       He can't do it. The simple like knucklehead way of charging that really hasn't, I don't know anybody who's still doing that or anybody who succeeded at charging for their podcasts. They do. No, they do very well. Which I do is, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Dan Carlin makes a good chunk of change out. He'll, he'll get angry with me and yeah. Well I barely make his podcast should, his podcast is very different because uh, like your audio books, it's more like audio books on history, but very dramatic and amazing flare to me really gets you excited about learning about history. But he charges for like the, he gives you the first 50 for free to get you hooked. And then if you want to get into the, the databases, once you really get addicted and you've been nothing but Dan Carlin for two months, you run out and then you're like, what the fuck?

Speaker 1:          01:31:05       And then he started paying money. Well that, that's, that's perfectly good. You know? Yeah, I know what you're paying for at that point. People like Ah, that's, that's totally worth a dollar an episode. I know I'm gonna get my money's worth. And then they don't give a shit. That's the same thing that happens with Nice staff. Like once they know what they're gonna get, they are perfectly fine paying whatever comes out. Well you know what, it'll change it. If everything became like Amazon one click where you just like your computer has all your credit card information and then if you want something, you just click on it and you go Amazon one click because the Amazon one click would be only be slightly more difficult than just clicking on it and downloading it slightly more difficult cause you gotta pay a dollar. It's just where the dollar. Okay. Let's see if it's worth a dollar click, it'd be pretty fucking easy to do. But if you want to actually buy it, like you gotta go and entering credit card information, get a pay pal account like this. A lot of fucking steps that you're just not going to do. You're just going to change the tab

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       and go to another website and you know, go download the Nerdist or something like that. Cause it's free. It's hard. It's hard to sell people on buying something. But that just means that people are like people looking at it from the wrong lens, you know there's a way to monetize it and I think your way is the smartest. Give him as much free content as possible. Then they go, wow, this guy's fucking talented and then they want to support you. Yeah. And there's a lot of, you know it's, I, it's putting there the decision in their hands. You, the customer know what you want to spend your money on and we honestly don't give a shit if they just keep downloading all of our books for free and never pay for anything. That's fine. Cause at the very least they're going to go to work or they're going to talk to their friends, go, oh my God, he should this crazy growth story heard called infected.

Speaker 4:          01:32:43       It's nuts. This guy stabbing himself with a fork for like five pages. It's nuts. And then eventually somebody they're talking to is going to go check it out or just go by the book. So it's not, you know, it's, it's one we're, we're, we're, we're, our goal is we entertain people. That's what we do. We take you out of your world, bring you into ours, take, get rid of all your stress for a little while. That's what we do for a living. Some people want to do that for free. Some people will pay for it. And even the people get it for free. You're going to go out. If we're good enough at our jobs, they're going to go out and talk to their friends about it and we're going to wind up getting that word of mouth exposure. But we're big on, we've got a giant chip on our shoulder.

Speaker 4:          01:33:14       We're like, ah, that's, I work so hard to make my stuff so good that I can give it to you for free. You're still going to give me money for it. That's a great way of looking at it too. You know what's cool about that? It's just, it's, it's cool to think that you're also getting by giving it away for free, you're getting that word of mouth exposure, which he would be willing to pay a lot of money for that. Yeah. I can't compete against the Stephen King. No one's put that kind of marketing money behind me in it and we know that this is a way for us to go out and get, get new fans and get people to try us out. Yeah. He's like royalty at this point. He's like, God, like it's aimed more at this point and super fucking prolifically up.

Speaker 4:          01:33:49       Jesus Christ makes you feel like such a lazy fuck when you see that guy just churning bad ass book after Badass Book. Yeah. It would be one thing if he was totally phoning it in, but he's not like, people love these new books. Then the new books that he's been coming out with, there's still bad. I just read doctor sleep, you know, the SQL to the shining and uh, yeah, Swahili. Yeah. Even heard of this. This is fucking excellent. It's really good. Whoa. And then how long ago did you put that in? Oh, it was only, I'm going to say it's hard, honestly, it's hard to tell them he's, he's already got to 800 page novels coming down the pipe, but I'm going to guess it was about three or four months ago. And it is the Danny Torrence, the little kid from the shining who's now chronologically this is like the same money or so now he's in his forties, early forties I think. And then he gets into a whole new perplexing situation, but book opens up with him, him hitting rock bottom as an alcoholic. Like it's rough. It's a rough read, spoiler alert. Yeah, no, you go. But it goes to some pretty nutty areas, so yeah. But he's prolific and he got what he down does down to a science. Did you read it? Yeah. Did you enjoy it as much as the original shining? No, I didn't. No, I didn't. And that's partially because

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       now that he's at such a royalty level, if he doesn't want to edit something, he doesn't have to. And it's the same thing. It's the same place George Rr Martin is, I'm not at that area. I can go up my publisher and say, Yep, 800 page novel. They'll say, great, bring come back when it's 500 pages and there's no way around it. You know, you've got to go through and refine that. And my editor is helping me make the story better and better. Stephen King, why is he going to listen to anybody? Honestly, at this point, and people come back and there's some, you know, 25 year old interns like Nia. I know, I think this movement to knee is too long and he's a shorten up. He's like, I'm Stephen King. I think I know what I'm doing. So the books now have, they don't move quite as fast as they used to move. That's interesting. So yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:35:38       So you credit the, the editors with helping you

Speaker 5:          01:35:41       with me. Absolutely. I'm a long winded, I'm a long winded motherfucker. Right. If you gave me my druthers, every book would be 1500 pages. You would need a wheelbarrow to carry that thing around if it wasn't for the editors. And you know, the, the people I work with, like my business partner, but the books would be just astronomically long. So what kind of relationship is that? That's an interesting relationship with them. I hate them. Uh, I'm bitching about one of the other and the other to the other all the time. You need them both. Yeah. Yeah. Well I stomp around the office a lot. Uh, you know, I've got some kettle bells in the office like God damn, sons of bitches, you know, and just and get mad and uh, uh, but it's, it's worked in a good relationship and um, I hate to admit it, but I, I bitch a lot during this process because I get so frustrated because I want it to be good.

Speaker 5:          01:36:28       I so badly want it to be perfect and I want people to read it and walk away. Like, holy crap, that's the best book I ever read. That's what I'm after every time. So when the editors coming back going, yeah, this isn't working. And I'm like, I've put eight months of work into that thing that you just want to get rid of, he's won. Beat the shit out of him. Right. I just want to beat the shit out. But they're right. They, the ultimately they wind up being right. Well when you stop listening, you know, your fiction becomes something else. Like [inaudible] you know, the process where he was. Everything he puts out makes 250 million at some point he stops listening to the people around them. Like, yeah, I don't think the village is working out. Maybe we should tweak this. And he's like, it's tying that back channel. Yeah. They don't ever see planes he doesn't have to listen to anymore. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. So, so I still, I still listen and it's not easy cause they got a bit of an ego with the fiction, but eventually these people break me down and uh, and we make, we make a more refined, better story.

Speaker 1:          01:37:19       That's very honest of you. It's a very honest in that, in that approach. And I think that's one of the reasons why you're so prolific and successful with your writing is that you have that ability to look at yourself and the entire situation objectively. It's very difficult to do for a creative person. Yeah. A lot of creative people are really bad at taking criticism.

Speaker 5:          01:37:35       I'm not good at it, but uh, the, the two, the three primary people involved in the process, my business partner, my agent and my editor, it's um, you know, I, I trust these people. They're successful at what they do. And at some point when they're telling you something that is directly opposite of what you think, you still have to sit down and go. Like, I'm going to evaluate what you're saying on own merits. And it's not like every time I change it, I are there. Their stuff, I'll be like, I'm fine. Don't fuckin publish the book if you don't want that in there. Right. I don't give a shit. Yeah. Like if that doesn't go in the book, you don't get the book. So there's, there's debate. It's not as simple as you just bring it to them and then they say this is too long and you shorten it up.

Speaker 5:          01:38:11       You sometimes go, no, it's not. So, so you stand your ground occasionally. Yep. How do you know when to stand your ground? There's just, there's certain things where, um, as a storyteller you might not be able to put into words the impact this moment we'll have, but you know, in your subconscious kind of, you know that structurally it's going to impact this point, this point, this point and then the ending. And then if you don't have this moment that the editor doesn't really, he's like, why, who cares what he had for breakfast for example? It doesn't matter. Like, yes, but that when, when they get to the end and see that breakfast food again at the end of the book, it's going to tie everything together and it's going to give the reader this sense of completeness in his, her whole soul and like there'll be satisfied, more satisfied with a book.

Speaker 5:          01:38:54       So there are things that I can't really explain or I'll try to explain and they're not listening. But eventually I'm just like, I know this works and that's got to go in there and that's just the end of the story. But then a part of the give and take is, you know, it's it, there's some quid pro quo and, and I've had mad at her come back. Okay, you can keep that, but if you keep that, you got to give up this. Wow. And he'll set it up in that like, and then I'll, and then I'll just, I get furious. This shit. Do you think you'll ever get rid of him? Uh, well then do you think you'll ever be like, look, let's say rich, I got this with the technology of ebooks. Couldn't you just take like those chunks? Like it's this huge chunks that they tell you to take out and make it like kind of like a director's cut.

Speaker 5:          01:39:33       Like, Hey, you buy an ebook and I'm also giving you this, like the whole thing. I worked on this storyline that they told me to cut out what we did that with my book ancestor, we had the final book from Crown, which is random house. And then there was like 50 pages they cut out at the beginning, like you don't need all that. The story starts here in the general thumb is you want to start as far into the story as you possibly can. But then I took those 50 pages and record them as a podcast and give them their radio. So it's kind of kind of the same thing. But this is the last pandemics, the last book I'm doing with Random House and my agents taking new book out called Flyer as of like today, literally today, starting to, to pitch it so we wind up with random house again, I may have the same guy or it may wind up with somebody else.

Speaker 5:          01:40:13       I've been super lucky and that I've had the same hardworking editor for all five bucks, which from what I've told is almost never happens to anybody. Seven, the same guy. So now he knows what I'm going for and he knows my style and he knows how to manage me to some regard and he knows when to ignore me when I'm calling him names and stuff like that. So it's been an awesome, awesome experience with him. So you have an editor, you have an agent that also reads it as well. How many different people read it before you had basically three? Basically three. Uh, my business partner tends to read everything first, um, and uh, and, and take her feedback. She has less feedback than the editor, but the feedback she brings back is more significant. Uh, so I'll pay attention to that. And then the agent usually only manages the first 80 pages. Got Crazy add. And I'm like, do you have to read the whole book? If you want to be part of the process, you've got to read the whole book. I promise I'm going to read the whole book. Then like the last five drafts is that first 80 pages. That's all he gets through.

Speaker 1:          01:41:08       If you want to be one of those wheeler dealer type agents, you've got to have that sort of mentality.

Speaker 5:          01:41:12       He's very, very, he's very good at what he does. But we'll all, he cares about us. He knows if I get this much of the book set up, he knows the sales process. Right. If you buy in the first 50 pages, he can sell the book, then your editors can fix the rest of it. So he's not that invested in the full length of the book. And then the real work is done with a, with Julie and the guy over at, at Crown Random House who reads, not only is he read it all the way through, he's reading it all the way through five times and having to pay close attention like we're talking like 500 page books. Wow. He needs to pay super close attention every time and I could not do his job at all.

Speaker 1:          01:41:47       Now when you structure your stories, do you use a software program to use index cards on a, a bulletin board? Like how do you set up where you're moving all your pieces in your tetris game?

Speaker 5:          01:41:58       I used to things we do use, I got a uh, magnetic whiteboard in the office and write on the index cards and put them all up with that. And sometimes, you know, strings between the cards, that kind of thing. That's the general getting it all down the flow. And then I use a program called scrivener, which people can use for Mac or PC. And it's basically the same thing. It's little index cards in the computer and there's an index card that represents a document. Each document is a chapter, but it's great. It's better than Microsoft word because Microsoft word, once you get past a hundred pages, 200 pages, you're copying big chunks and moving around and it becomes a nightmare cause you're gonna screw something up. But Scribner, he just grabbed this icon and drag it before this icon. It rearranges everything. So I've gotten pretty adept at using that a highly recommend it. It's great for scatterbrain to keep everything flowing. And then a lot of times it'll just be, you know, I get overwhelmed with the screen and everything going on and I'll just pull out the three by five index cards and start writing everything down again, bullet points and those put them up on the board and go through it that way.

Speaker 1:          01:42:59       So you like to do it digitally, like to do it manually. You like to just mix it up and constantly keep doing it in a different way that keeps your brain moving?

Speaker 5:          01:43:08       Yeah, it, what I find is when you get stuck there, there's a couple of different things. Number one, if you're just staring at that screen and you're stuck, just getting your hands involved in a pen. And I, you know, like just an ink pen and paper is a tactile experience is different experience at activates different parts of your brain sometimes can like, oh now I get it, now I see what I was stuck on. So that's part of it. And other parts of it is either, there's only so much screen real estate, so you can only see so many things at one time. If you really stuck, you pull back, right? All these index cards, you put it up in this, you know, four foot by five foot whiteboard and you kind of look at everything that can spring your brain free at times too. So it's largely, it's grabbing whatever's, if I get stuck in one area, I'll start going to other areas and um, when I get really overwhelmed, frustrated, I am

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       more comfortable slipping back into, you know, the eight year old version of me, which is a little piece of paper and some notes or an index card and go back and just ride it out till it all kind of flows onto the page. So as long as the process is just continuing over and over and over again. Yeah, that's a scrivener. Yup. Yeah, I use that for jokes I use. Yeah I use it. I use a couple of different things. One, I use a real chalkboard or real a corkboard rather. And I have index cards and I put them up with pins and I have bits. I have a one star, two star and three star. One star is a completely new bit, two stars a bit. That's still improving. Three stars is a bit, that's pretty close to being done. They always grow and change and get weird.

Speaker 3:          01:44:32       And there's always like new directions they take on certain shows and cause I mixed them up to, I'll mix up the order of like the different pieces inside the bit to try to figure out which way works. And I like scrivener because I could take those cards and just move them around. And sometimes when I'm just studying, just thinking about my act, maybe I'll listen to recordings. It's one of the most uncomfortable parts of standup. But I think one of the most important, you got to listen to pen, see yourself, um, and, and listen to like, Ooh, I don't like how I did that. Like there's too much, too much bullshit and that joke and that this joke is Kinda clunky and the wording's not good or the inflection is too fake or what have you. You know? So, uh, that process is a aided by that.

Speaker 3:          01:45:14       And one of the things that I really love was going to ask you about is right room ever use right room. I've used it just to look on the phone now. Right room is the one that takes your entire screen. It makes it black and gives you that green screen. We'll do that to you. Oh it does. It really Scribner's got a white out or a blackout feature and I can get sort of everything on the screen except what you're reading. So kind of the same thing. Oh, okay. Cool. Yeah. Well that's right. Room doesn't give you access to anything. You can't go to the toolbar. You can't say what time it is. You don't get shit. Yeah, that's right. Room. That's what it looks like. I really, really like it. It's my favorite. I, it's something I probably need to start using more and Scribner cause I get distracted trying to stay in touch with social media and everything else.

Speaker 3:          01:45:49       And if you're on the computer and a fan is asking you a question, the natural impulses to go answer that question. So, you know, getting to a point where I can just ignore all that. But, um, I was just in Vegas for the new media expo and when I really get into it and I was under deadline, so I started writing at noon. We were staying at the Rio, don't have the seafood buffet at the rail. I will tell you that I, how dare you. Oh my God. Oh my God. I've said that the top, the best vomit of my whole life and has been a lot of vomiting, clams and a musket. Oh, I don't even know. I don't know what it was but it was, it was Linda Blair shit. It was crazy. But I'm, I'm writing and it's like noon out and like there's the window and the window is open and by the time I got finished it looked out and it was pitch black outside. So sometimes I can't imagine it's the same thing when you're writing more of the short form jokes and moving around from the jokes. But for this long form things like 50 page story, I had my own screen came up and I, that's all I was working on. I didn't look at anything else. Just wrote the whole thing through. Yeah. You can get in those zones. Uh, I don't write jokes like joke jokes.

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       What I do is I write about subjects and I find the jokes in what I write about it when he went. What I find is that when I'm writing about things, it takes longer for me to write the word history then for me to think of it or know it exists. If I'm thinking about history, I can think about it. But I have to say his tier. I mean I have to actually individually type all the letters and in that you, you have much more consideration to every sentence that you write every, every chapter, every concept because you're, you're thinking a lot quicker than your writing. So as you're writing it down, you're considering deeply each, it's like its forces you to pause and consider each individual word, consider the, the, the, the concept you're actually talking about far more than if you were just having a conversation.

Speaker 1:          01:47:39       You're having a conversation. It takes more, it takes, it's much quicker to get the words out. Right. I think in that slowing you down, it makes you consider things more and then sometimes you'll just miss like really obvious shit that you would have missed it if you were talking, but when you're riding like, oh, and what about this? And then you'll go off in some other directions. Like you give your brain like a different rhythm. The rhythm of writing. No talking, no, no, no distractions, no fucking music. Stop all the nonsense. Lock the door, hit the right room and just go. Yeah. Do you find, do you find you have to go for a certain amount of time before all of a sudden shit starts to take off? I'm useless for the first half hour. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:48:19       Sometimes I, I don't even take credit for the things I write because it's not me writing them. You know? It's your inner, your inner muse. We'd wrote it. We wrote that one. No, I don't know how that one in me, I, I'm like the first 30 minutes are usually just trash, absolute trash work and then at some point something just takes over and you're making really good stuff. It's interesting, isn't it? That that weird switch that goes off where you find yourself really zen in what you're doing? For me it is probably around the same time, about 30 minutes in 2030 minutes. The first 20 minutes, I don't even think, I'm just trying to smash keys and write things down and just thinking, but just kind of getting into it and trying to, and then somewhere along the line you catch traction. My add is so bad.

Speaker 1:          01:49:02       Now I've got a technique like I'll just set the alarm on the phone instead of 30 minutes and then I'm like, okay, I'm just not going to look at anything else. I can do this for 30 minutes. It's just starting that that bad. That's bad. Force yourself to write for 30 minutes, doesn't matter what you write and then almost invariably by the time the buzzer goes off, you're just like turn it off and you're just like, cause you're, you're rolling at that point, but you have to force yourself to be like, I have to get into that groove. My groove is usually also to move around the house. I like to pick up my laptop and go sit somewhere else, go sit in my uh, you know, sit in my living room, go sit upstairs, go sit in front of the TV. You don't even watch TV. Just sit on the couch. And I think that when I do that, instead of just being in my office and stare at the screen sometimes just being in a different space, sitting in a different place, just go, oh, we're here now. And that just that changing of your routine, just a little variation on it sometimes can spark the mind an interesting new direction.

Speaker 5:          01:49:55       Yeah. You get, you get down these wormholes and just getting any other kind of sensory input, which goes back to now I'm going to write things down instead of type them out or anything like that can cause it's all in there. All that stuff you want to come up with is in there. It's not like you're, you know, it's not like you have a factory where you have to make all this crap. It's all already in there. You just kind of getting, figuring out how to mine it out of your own brain and put it onto the page,

Speaker 1:          01:50:15       you know? And I also find super beneficial. A Walk, a walk. Yeah. Walk, you know, and uh, used to bring a recorder, but now with these new cell phones, you don't have to know your phone can record amazing notes and I just go for a walk, walk my dogs or something like that, go down the street. And just when I'm thinking about something and I've got something in my head and I'm done writing and then I'm reviewing the things that I wrote and like, how would I, how would I view this if I was a person who was reading it? Like how would I, how would I take this? Like I'll, I'll take it into consideration as I'm walking. It's like the fat, you know, there's something about forcing yourself to do a mundane, very obvious task. Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, and then you can get into that groove of introspective thought. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:50:56       Yeah. And it does. Some of that to me is like I've, I've got this little tiny office, but there's like a loop. There's like four rooms and you actually go from kitchen to this room to the entryway to the writing room. And I just don't do labs, so I just started doing laps and it usually doesn't take very long because you're turning right all the time, every two steps. And it's, there's something about your brain has to put some level of attention on and not walking into things. And that usually comes from the part that's blocking you. The part that stopped me, like you're convincing yourself, you can't get this shit out and now, okay. Oh, all right. Boom that run back to the desk and start writing things down

Speaker 1:          01:51:28       really quick. Have you ever tried using speech recognition software for writing? Right.

Speaker 5:          01:51:32       Wouldn't work for me only because I'm, by the time I block a sentence down, it's probably already be written, been rewritten three times. Start the sentence, go back, start sentence, go back. And unfortunately a pretty fast typer. I learned that a long time ago. It was, I knew I wanted to write and yeah, I just changed things. Sell fast like it's all muscle memory now. It's like copy this, paste this, move this around. I, I cannot imagine speech recognition would ever work for me.

Speaker 1:          01:51:55       The um, uh, Mavis beacon teaches typing. That's the one I owe, I owe. That made us bake and she goes, yeah, that was a for me meant I was the poker guy. Yep. Looking right at them. It took a long time. Genius product. Like no, just play video games pitch. He goes and like what? I'm just playing video games and all of a sudden I can type, it was amazing. Amazing. And it's their fun games. Like you're racing and share that you're doing all kinds of different stuff and figuring out where the little keys are. That's, that's so important, man. I used to have one of those goofy keyboards. It was like separated split ones. Yeah. And your hands rest on it and ship those died off. What happened there? Economic.

Speaker 5:          01:52:33       I just want to be working on my end. I don't think they worked for crap. They're supposed to be good for you. I had the one that actually was like a transformer. It actually had a hand. You went out to the sides. That thing was bad ass. Did you ever get it? Get

Speaker 1:          01:52:43       the one where you sink in, you sink your fingers in. There was a weird one like this.

Speaker 4:          01:52:48       Fingers like sitting in a cradle. I still have to look like every now and then I'm still glancing down to get some kind of tracking going on, which I don't need to do any more, but it can't break myself of the habit like I can, I can I do this. Sometimes when I'm all overwhelmed with an idea, I'll just close my eyes and just start typing so I don't need to do it anymore, but I'm still, I can't break that habit of looking down at the screen. That's ancient. That's the thing. Look at that. Yeah. Yeah. I had one of those. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:53:13       there was those and then there was the Microsoft ones are a little bit more curly and they had like a us an actual space in between. Didn't separate. They're just, it's more like lumpy. They called them ergonomic keyboard makes those things anymore. I don't think, I don't know. You know what the problem is, you get used to those and then you go to a laptop and it's feels weird. You know, a lot of people are typing their stuff on laptops now. So like the way you learn how to type on a laptop is you want your fingers to be right in that position of j and f the fingers across the board. And then from there you go. If you go back and forth from laptop to keyboard delight, this is like a thinking part. We have to like a quarterback changing. You're throwing lotions to change everything around. Yeah. It fucks with you. Yeah. But the speech recognition software is fascinating to me because I wonder if that I'll ever be something that I'm interested in because, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:54:02       for the walks, I have to imagine, you know. Right. You're walking, you're still speak everything down.

Speaker 1:          01:54:07       No, I just record it. Right. And Go back and listen to, yeah. I go back and listen to it. I really find that there's a completely different state of mind. Uh, the actual writing state of mind, and I find that I'm way more creative when I could just sit in total silence, not hear my voice or anybody's voice and the right, I'll, I'll allow my brain to go in all sorts of weird directions when they're not, it's not attached to flowing, moving language. Ideas can serve emerge instantaneously and I just try to follow them and capture them in writing. I think a, I limit myself when I'm actually talking.

Speaker 4:          01:54:39       Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Know it comes to writing things. Yeah. It, it's for me, but at this point it's just down to, it's a process. Now I've got the process going and getting more and more comfort with the process. So hopefully I'm growing towards that. You know, Stephen King's process is just so fast that your process is also very creative. I mean, you have to have this idea. You have to have the story, you have to create this story. That part's never people. Some people talking about writer's block, I've never had that. I've had the opposite, which is just this on slot of cool ideas. Like this would be a good book. And this be a good book and trying to try and keep track of everything. So the, the creative part, um, being a scatter little kid fortunately just has never been an issue for me.

Speaker 4:          01:55:19       It's all it with me. It's always been the discipline of being able to write it down and trying to fight the add and you know, and like I have to keep working on this to make it the best it can be. When after the first draft, I'm kind of already done with it. I'm like, oh, I want to, I want to go do something else, but you can't. You got to go back and keep hammering on that sword, making it make it a good weapon. Yeah, that's, that's really interesting that it's the, the different of

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       creative processes that all try to achieve the same thing. Whether it's a song or a movie or a book or, or a joke. It's this completely fascinating to me, the different ways that people approach it in different, the different mindsets they have in approaching it too.

Speaker 4:          01:55:58       You know this, that there's, there's no one pattern, which is what's fascinating about the human brain and everybody's got a different way of doing it and just keep working at it till you get to that end product and where you can hopefully look at what you finished with. And I think all creative people kind of have the same thing. You probably have it too, like that's a pretty good joke. That's not the best it could possibly be, but I think that's pretty good. That's going to go in the arsenal for the next stand up. And with me, it's like that book is pretty good. I would work on that book for the next 10 years, every day to try and make everything perfect. But you know, at least for me there, there is no perfection. Like, and here's some others go. I keep working on until I've absolutely the perfect, the perfect phrase and the perfect sentence in a perfect paragraph and the perfect page, that's great. But you know, we got to put a book out and sell some books so I can't work on a book for 10 years. Yeah, it's never perfect either because your perception,

Speaker 1:          01:56:45       sins of it change radically from d. I mean like there's stuff that I enjoyed that I did just a couple of years ago that if I have to watch now, I don't, I don't know. Yeah, anything to do with it. I don't want to watch it. I want to listen to it.

Speaker 4:          01:56:57       Ron, I mean just to 24 months ago I'm like, I don't want to hear it. I've gotten to the point now where unless it's for research, I don't go back and reread the old books. And I heard an interview with Bryan Cranston on Nerdist that really helped a ton with that, which you know when he's just kicking everybody's ass at breaking bad and he's like the baddest actor ever at this moment. He was really focused on, he puts everything he has into that performance and then the second he walks off the set he's done. He's like, I'm not paying attention to that anymore. I'm moving on to the next thing I did as best I can. So with my books, cause I get worked every time I reread a book and find a mistake or some kind of goof up or something, the character motivation isn't right. I get super angry and super worked up. So now I just don't read that stuff. Like it's got to go. Well I think

Speaker 1:          01:57:38       that you sort of, when, when you're done with a project, you've internalized everything that you're gonna learn from that everything that you've, you know, I, I feel like as an artist, as a crafts person, whether it's a writer or anything or a musician, I think you're getting better all the time or you're not getting better. It's one of the two. Either you're getting better all the time and you're constantly working on improving things or you're not. And um, there's only a certain amount of time that you should consider the past certain amount of time he consider past work. And cause if you consider it, you're really robbing yourself, present work, you're really robbing yourself of the focus that you could be using on working on the shit that you thinking about right now. So in that mindset, I just start getting repulsed, repulsed by my old stuff. Like I don't want to talk. How's

Speaker 4:          01:58:21       it [inaudible] if I find myself on TV, I go flip the channel. The other day I was in my car two times in a row and raw dog was playing my comedy. I'm like, shut up. I want to fucking hear me. I don't want to hear me. I don't want to even think that I was a different person 10 years ago and I'm concentrating on right now. I had experience recently stand up. Uh,

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       not, I'm not doing standup listening. Stand up that show me how much I have changed as a person and I'm on Pandora all. I listened to his, uh, comedy on Pandora. That's like when I'm not writing. Okay, I got to pick up the opposite. Got to clean up. Let's put out some comedy on Pandora and just let that cycle through and hear new stuff. And I started a new channel for the Andrew dice clay channel and I go, now, I was in college, we were all crazy for dice. Like there was like we get, we gathered in the room and watch VHS, it'd be like eight guys. Why? Just like, ah, you're the best. And then I'm listening to it now and I'm remembering these, hearing him do all these old bits and I'm like, Oh, I love this bit. And then I'm listening to it.

Speaker 5:          01:59:15       I'm like, yeah, this isn't really all that funny to me anymore. This is so racist and so massage and this and that. Like, you know, like somebody who's really good at racist team right now as is Daniel tosh like can do it in a way that doesn't make you uncomfortable. Like I don't know how he does it, but listen to Andrew dice. Clay was like this, I don't, this isn't for me. And more aggressive. Yeah, well it's in the bowl bitch. Oh. And I realized like I was, what we were all laughing at was that, that amazing the delivery is delivering is timing were great, but the actual subject matter was, and I'm like, I cannot believe how much I have changed that I don't find this funny anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:59:52       See I've gotten more immature and I find it funnier. Is that right? Because what I know he's doing is he's doing an act. Yeah. Doing a character, you know, he makes things up like his characters is preposterously ridiculously oversexed asshole, you know, and you know what to expect. So I enjoy it from this completely non politically correct approach that he's doing. Like as a, you know, that's his act. That's what he's chosen to do. Right. I mean he could easily start doing clean jokes and concentrate on that. No, he's gotten dirty or he wears weightlifting. Gloves is good. His hair slicked back. He's wearing a fanny pack and he's talking about sucking Dick. Oh, it's fun. Big Glasses. It's, he's got giant old lady, old Jewish lady I seen as new step in awhile. He's Larry. We saw him in Vegas. It was me, Brian Anthony from opie and Anthony and Jim Norton and Bobby Kelly.

Speaker 1:          02:00:49       A bunch of comedians. And we fucking cried laughing. Yeah, it was so, cause it was for us. First of all, we know it's an act. We know it's comedy. We know. I mean we, we've been aware of it. I was a huge fan before ever got into comedy, so to be there like in Vegas, having a couple of cocktails and be able to watch, just sit there and watch. It was fucking hell. I bet. I bet. Live. It's still pretty impressive. Ridiculous. He's talking about how to catch fag, how you catch, how you make it a gay kid. It was so ridiculous. It was so ridiculous. Like talking about how

Speaker 5:          02:01:24       so you get fig like he, he's trying to get more and more preposterous. There's, there's all right. All of

Speaker 1:          02:01:31       us, there's all of us. After the show is, it was really fucking funny. I mean me and Jimmy Norton and Brian and we were crying, laughing. It was really funny. But it's ridiculous. There's an art form in sang ridiculous shit. You don't really mean. Right, and that's what I think dice does. Right? But if you, yeah, if you were alone in your car,

Speaker 4:          02:01:50       if you're in your home and you're completely sober and you're listening to some of the horrible things, he said like, what the fuck, man, I'm uncomfortable laughing at this now. I don't know what that says about me. It's fiction. It's, you know, if from the characters tractive I catch a ton of shit for my books. Do you? Yeah. I get people, like, people are so caught up in their own, this is who I am. You can make fun of everybody else outside of this area. But the second you touch on my area, you're a dick. So I get it in black, like me talking about dice clay right now, I get people like, I can't believe your, that massage Mike. No, that's this asshole character. That's not me. That's the character. And people can't, some people can't differentiate that, but nobody has a problem with it until it's their particular area. Yes. Yeah. If you're picking on vegans or transsexuals, are Republicans, right?

Speaker 2:          02:02:41       Getty you that Natasha Leggiero a thing that happened over the weekend?

Speaker 1:          02:02:45       No. Yeah, she, she made a joke. Uh, she was doing, Carson Daly had a new year's show in Times Square and she made a joke about a old folks and, um, World War Two and Pearl Harbor and she got more fucking hate, like unbelievable amounts of people were angry at her. So she made a non-apology put it on our website and she's like, fuck, it's beautiful, you know, to, to do that in the fake, her apology was brilliantly written to which she said is she was called a cunt so many times. She thought she was in a British pub rooting for the wrong thing.

Speaker 4:          02:03:21       Soccer team, her originally

Speaker 2:          02:03:24       joke wasn't even a Pearl Harbor joke. It was just a denture joke about old people eating spaghettio's because spaghetti has got so much shit for having that image of a spaghetti holding an American flag that they put up on Pearl Harbor Day just to kind of show respect now, you know? And then they were like, what? How dare you, you know what? It was the actual joke. Do you have a, yeah, I'll pull it up. But it was a,

Speaker 4:          02:03:47       uh, hold on. Yeah. There's a lot of people out there that fucking love to be offended. Oh yeah. I live in San Francisco for crying out loud.

Speaker 1:          02:03:55       Well yes, there's a lot in there and they love to talk about being offended and they love to get angry at you because they're offended.

Speaker 4:          02:04:02       Well you, uh, you are big on the Internet. I'm sure you deal with that daily basis. Look at that. And then Tagetik live. Hold on, scroll up. Scroll up. Popular comedian living today. She's cool. I love her. Pandora just introduced me to her like a couple of weeks ago. She's great. She's very nice too. She's a nice, nice

Speaker 1:          02:04:19       person. Stated two of my friends too. Hmm. Now three cause I like Moshe to uh, yeah, she, but she wrote on her thing. She's not apologizing for shit. I love it. Cool. Yeah. Cause there's always people out there that are going to want you to apologize for something that's fucking ridiculous to apologize. They're always going to exist.

Speaker 5:          02:04:38       I got the, the most recent one that came up and you don't think it's bad until somebody actually kind of calls you on it in the book. Nocturnal. There's a character who has Tourette's syndrome and also has a, a voicebox has lost his voice, a voice box due to throat cancer. So it's kind of preposterous. And then he's always talking to the main character, trying to make main character like fuck are Brecker sacred dick or soccer and like it's this crazy combination of things, which is actually a true story that a friend of mine who got arrested was in the drunk tank and there was a, there was a guy with the, you know, the voice box and he had Tourette's. And he's telling me the story of bar. I'm like, that's so going in a book. Are you kidding me? That's fucking awesome. And then one of my longtime fans finally listens to this book and we do the audio books and it's really over the top when we do it in the audio books, it sounds like the guy from south park basically. And uh, she's like, that's not funny. I have treads. And I'm like, you're like, okay. So now you have to write because it's directly impacts are, and it looks like we're mocking her, but you have to write an apology. We're like, yeah, I'm not gonna apologize for the story because it's a character. But you know, it's unfortunate that that hit you in your, your personal soft spot, so to speak. And I didn't mean to marginalize you, but I'm not changing the story. It's great

Speaker 1:          02:05:51       funny though that it, if it's like someone can say that's not funny and then you're not allowed to talk about it. But if it wasn't funny at all, if it was like a tragic situation where a person had Tourette's and it was out of control and is in a story, then that would be different because that's not mocking. That's not putting into a comedy. You know, like you could depict it. You can depict Tourette's and depict Tourette's being an issue that maybe, you know, the people that actually have it can say, oh, that's very similar to what I have to deal with. And they would be fine with it. But it's making the laughs out of it. Yeah. That and that's what ticked off this fan and finding them. It's weird

Speaker 5:          02:06:26       even being able to explain like, well, the point of the joke is that you never know whether he has it or not or he's just using it as an excuse to be an asshole to everybody. Um, but you know, and that, that, that one person, that's what every character that I create goes through something to that effect where somebody calls out and goes, yeah, that's not funny

Speaker 1:          02:06:43       dude. Yeah, but they're fucking assholes. They really are. They're really assholes. And there's self serving clients because you really have to look at the big picture. I mean, you, you're telling, what are we saying? Are we saying that Tourette's doesn't exist? We saying that people aren't crazy and the dude's don't have voice boxes. Like what combination of these things is unrealistic. Yeah. And also it's also a story about cannibalistic monsters living under the streets of San Francisco. Yeah. Fuck fictional fun. Ya know, people are cons man. If you pick on lesbians, they will come after you with fucking baiting here. They are very quick to raise their defense. Vegetarians also furious. Vegans are me. Armenians go after Armenians. Watch what happens. They'll fucking kill you. Yeah. Here's the no kill you, the beat you in the streets if you want to look at it. It's pretty much just the Jay Leno joke

Speaker 6:          02:07:28       here. Harbor Day, they sent out a tweet featuring their mascot holding an American flag, asking people to quote, take a moment to remember Hashtag [inaudible] Pearl Harbor with us. It offended a lot of people [inaudible] sentimental American historic traditions, seemingly looking for people in business and it wasn't good. But you are offended for another reason. They're referring to spaghetti. I says, that's it.

Speaker 3:          02:08:01       That's actually a good joke. Yeah, that's a good joke. Fuck, fuck over that. Wendy's is that. It's um, I forgot that dude's name and Anthony. Yeah, Anthony Anderson. That didn't seem all that bad to me. That wasn't bad at all. Fuck everybody. But if I was a survivor, real Pearl Harbor, that'd be a different ballgame. But her response was so perfect because she was like one of the few people that didn't like bow down and take it and just say, I'm sorry. Even though she didn't mean it. And her response is so great because she's a real comic. Steve Martin is on a comic anymore. Steve Martin, apologize for like one of the lamest jokes ever. Some silly tweet where he's talking about Lasagna, like spelling it differently if you were African Americans like cause like spelling it like the pronunciation. Like they would say Lasagna or something like that.

Speaker 3:          02:08:44       I don't remember what it was. It was, it was just a joke and people would bid his fucking head off and he pulled the tweet and apologize. Oh Steve, listen to who changed. Things have changed for Steve. Silly Bitch. You're, you're listening to dummies. Just cause they can talk to you doesn't mean they're smart. Just because they could reach you doesn't mean they're smart. It's so hard to keep a perspective sometimes too. You get two or three tweets and I, I some, I've seen some of the tweet hazing that you've got or the tweet conflicts, whatever. And like all of a sudden you have this large audience, but these 50 people are focused on it and like you got to pay attention to it. Right. You at least have to have some kind of response to it. But fuck 'em all Scott at that block. But you don't want to like be on follow me. Oh, enjoy my block.

Speaker 3:          02:09:35       Yeah. Um, no, I don't engage a man because you can engage them when we can engage the people that are being nice. Sometimes I'll engage people in a mocking way if I, if I'm giggling at them. But to get actually angry at them for what? To actually say. There's one thing if you did something wrong or if there's like some sort of a remorse that you have for your actions and maybe someone's reacting to that. Something Real, not like this Natasha thing that was, you know, it's possible you could fuck up and say something he didn't really mean or you said it too quickly, didn't realize how ridiculous it wasn't till after he said it. Yeah. But if there's none of that and then you're getting hate, like what are you doing? You're going to just pay attention to people that just look to hate people for no fucking reason. Are they living in the past? Is there can be times too where somebody says something like, Geez, I never thought about it from that particular perspective. And that's a logical perspective. So yeah, I'll, I'll re rethink what I said there, but that's pretty rare. Well, I, um, have one thing that I really do enjoy and it's a, a

Speaker 1:          02:10:33       lot of people were very uncomfortable with when they get hyper criticized when someone like attacks them and tax them in a way that actually makes sense. But I think those people that do that, um, whether they like it or not, they're helping you because even if they're wrong, they're forcing you to consider whether or not there's any merit in what they're saying. And if you can't find any merit and what they're saying, then you relieved of any future attacks like that. Like it's like, oh, you're another one. No, you're another crazy person that has a distorted view of reality. And the reason why you have this distorted view of reality can be many, many, many, many different reasons. You could be fucking jealous. You could be crazy, you could be psychotic, you could just do that. I've gotten to people's twitters, like they'll, they'll, they'll say something hateful to you and you think about responding and then you go to their Twitter feed and it's just them attacking everyone. Fucking Dimi more to Koby Bryant to fucking anybody can find. That's what some people do. They just, they, they throw out a bunch of different lures and hope somebody bites and not even a real person.

Speaker 5:          02:11:36       I unfortunately, I, I pretty much weaned myself from looking at Amazon reviews anymore cause there's just some assholeishness that goes on there like nobody's business. Youtube is the center of, oh I can't, I don't even look at those youtube comments on Amazon. I'll go and once in a while I'll see a one star review and you know, like I worked my ass off for two years. You son of a bitch, what do you got to say about it? And once in a while they're like, they take the book apart and like from your perspective, I can see that's a crappy book the way you see it, no problem. But most of them are just, they didn't actually read the book. Like you can tell from the review, like they read 20 pages and stopped and gave you a one star review and you get all super pissed off and then you go and you click on that and you'd read through their other reviews and it's just like endless stars. One star reviews and like five stars or twilight and you're like, okay, that's not really my audience.

Speaker 1:          02:12:22       You know what I've found really fascinating about people like that, the people who are really harsh on like writers or movies or what have you, and you read their criticisms and there's often a lot of work put into that stuff. A lot of work put into the criticisms. Like I've gotten people's Yelp pages. You'd read like a really evil Yelp and you're like, okay, let's go to this guy's Yelp page and see what he, you know, he hates this restaurant so much. Let's see what he says about everything and everything is like really well written destruction of of various restaurants or various things and you go, oh, I see what that guy's doing. He's, he's distracting himself from his own failures. He's attacking everything is being mediocre and not even realizing how ironic it is. He's put all of his energy into criticizing other people's work because he's avoiding doing his own. That's a big thing with a lot of these like bloggers and critics and people that are right. What are they actually doing here? You're writing a bunch of evil, evil shit, but what are you actually contributing other than your opinion? Dog Shit. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:13:20       What do you, what do you make, what do you put up? What do you put out in the world? Like the people whose whole world is nothing, but I'm going to rip on Coby Brian, I'm going to, I'm going to come out and rip on Lebron James for under achieving

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       and you're like, what the fuck do you do? What do you want this guide to do for Christ sakes, like that thing and then the Yelp and people ripping on everything. You're like, just if you don't like the way they do it, go do it and something great yourself. I very rarely attack journalists, but I have gone after a few MMA journalists who have written evil shit about fighters. Just really nasty, stupid, fucking hurtful snarky shit. Right? And the only reason why they're doing it, it's just their comments, you know? And you got to expose them for what they are. I mean, just because someone falls short is because someone tries and gets beat up by someone who's better than them, you know, have some respect for that process of development, of understanding, of exploration, of adventure that these fighters go on for your entertainment, the sacrifice they have to make just to be able to get in that ring.

Speaker 3:          02:14:18       And like if you show up in the UFC cage, you've, you've already done an enormous amount of shit. Stunning, stunning sacrifices. Even when they make horrible excuses for why things went wrong, in my opinion, that has to be treated with an objective sense of respect. You have to understand that psychologically they're defeat is unbelievably brutal. That a fighter going through a defeat, like they're looking for some reason to stay alive when they're telling you they're very raw. W I had staff and then I got the flu and then maybe those things are true, but the reason why they have to tell you about those things is they're fucking falling apart their life into their calling and looking for something to gain some sort of a victory. Like he might've kicked my ass, but I was in a car accident six weeks ago, man, I had to deal with insurance and they find some reason to give them some reason that they're worth something.

Speaker 3:          02:15:08       And you'd like those journalists once in a while to say something to the effect of yeah, that was bad. UFC fight, it's still better than any UFC fight I've ever been in because I've never gotten in the ring in my frigging life. I don't think they have to say that. I think they just have to treat the situation with respect and they have to treat what a fighter is actually doing and they have to treat it differently than playing basketball. Cause it's not the fucking, same thing when a basketball games lost, if you go home crying and freaking out, you probably a baby. Okay. But when you get your ass kicked in there, that guy stole a little piece of your life. He stole some happiness from you. And if you don't, if you don't respect that, it's because nobody ever beat you up. If somebody, if you ever fought and someone kicked your ass, you would realize, you know, it's like this is not a good feeling at all and we'll, let's just analyze what happened in the fight itself.

Speaker 3:          02:15:54       You know, if you want a psychologically breakdown, what, what's wrong with the guy and where it goes wrong to do it with respect. It can be done with respect. But W we have as a bunch of really shitty writers who only get attention by being negative. That's, but that's been the sports writing. That's why I got on sports radio, sports radio. It's sports writing. And I've been like really disrespectful to those guys because I don't think that has any place in martial arts. I believe if you want to get shitty about a football player, if that's your tradition, that's fine. But if you want to add that same sports guy, bullshit, talk to martial arts, I say fuck you. You don't know what you're talking about, right? You don't know what you're some fucking dummy. Some dumb dumb football guy does. Amateur football was talking about Anderson Silva breaking his leg and he's saying, this is why I would never cover MMA and I don't watch it.

Speaker 3:          02:16:42       Never will. You know, and like dummy, you're a part of the number one sport for traumatic brain injuries, the number one football, and you're also amateur football, which means he didn't even get paid. So the university's pimp these kids out, they make fucking billions of dollars on college football. That's what you cover. And you make your living off of it while the players make none and they're getting fucking brain damage left and right. And you're complaining about MMA, just fuck you dummy you sports dummy. Yeah, a bunch of these sports dummies and being a former small time sports writer and a former like small time college athlete, they being able to see both of those sides of the coin and anybody competing at that level. Just the amount of work and talent just to get to be sucky at something because astronomical and most of these writers have never, they've never done anything even close to what they're talking about and their whole career is based on how much of a dick can I be.

Speaker 3:          02:17:41       Much intention and that's how they got attention for the longest time. I don't think that that's going to last anymore. I think that that sort of, that was fine when everything was being distributed by media networks. When everything that you, you couldn't really comment on it. If you were a fan of Jim Rome, the radio show 10 years ago or so. I mean how, what kind of feedback could you ever give him, you know, get there was no fried back and when he did something controversial, people listened and they watch. It was an adequate way of gathering up attention. But I think that these want to be guys and these guys that are coming along now that are trying to do that, they're really fucking themselves by playing this act of being this, you know, really Shitty, you know, sports guy talk. Because I think ultimately that's going to be exposed as being a really ineffective way of communicating negative and not really fun to listen to either.

Speaker 3:          02:18:31       The judgmental level, I don't know that that'll ever go away because I think unfortunately a lot of the people watching this stuff want way to feel better about themselves and bitching about players is still huge. It has no place in martial arts. It will never work in martial arts. That's good. That's, it could be an oasis of logic then in the world of assholery. Well, the stakes are higher than any other sport. The stakes are the emotional state. And so his break, that's pretty tough. Well, that happens in football. That happens in basketball and I have been catastrophic injuries and almost every kind of really physical explosive sport. It's unavoidable. And, but what Anderson they break that he had was very unusual. I've only been, I've only seen two of those ever live in person, and I've called well over a thousand fights. There's was probably close to 1500 fights in my career doing commentary.

Speaker 3:          02:19:17       Right. I've only seen it twice. So it's pretty rare. So for someone to point that out, that's why I don't watch MMA or never worked ridiculous. Every stupid cheerleading has catastrophic and has paralysis, death, crazy high school. Cheerleading is really fucking dangerous. They're flipping each other. Doing Pyramids just started that crap and I'm very nervous about it is very scary to let me ask a question. Can you guys play my pandemic trailer for the book? Fuck you. Then I can hit the, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Is that coffee? When and how long have you, oh yeah, please. Two minutes were very rude and asking people to sit here for three hours. I don't give a shit. This is awesome. Any time, just feel free to go to youtube and look for Scott Sigler pandemic. I'm just going to talk shit about you as soon as I know.

Speaker 3:          02:19:55       I know because you haven't, you haven't accomplished anything. Josie got to drag me down. How rude. Go drill down. Where is your, um, where's your trailer at? Deserves a second yet for it. Is there a specific websites? Foul mouth though. It's got swearing in it. That's, we'd like that. Yes. Is there a way that folks at home can go and they can see a URL? They can all find it at Scott's a go.com/pandemic that's got the youtube embedded right there. Or just go to youtube and search for Scott Sigler pandemic. I liked that. A authors are doing this now making youtube. Whoops. There we go.

Speaker 7:          02:20:29       Holy Shit. They come around me and they die. It takes like a, maybe like a full hours are sober. They die just like a fucked up. Is this Chris?

Speaker 3:          02:21:23       Ooh, hard. Stephen King Park. Chuck, try to pronounce that last name.

Speaker 7:          02:21:29       Antibodies. Palo of dead dead. They're all dead because of me. Get me. Please come and get me. I make these assholes. Do you want to save the world and they're fucking seat. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:22:10       Dogs for excited. What is it like to see your words come to life in a visual form like that? It's awesome. It's awesome because you got, uh, you know, you've got to give that over to somebody who's creative in a different area than you. And like I do, you know, we, we picked out parts of the book, like an

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       actual scene from the book. We could turn it in that trailer and then gave it over these guys, the company's name, res Gregson there, here in a l a u r e s Grex I think the gay guy who directed, it's name's Adrian Bacardi. And he already shot a couple a thing earlier for ancestor, but said, do this and then have to watch how he does the whole thing. And they shot that in the same warehouse where they filmed a inception. And so that was pretty fucking sweet. You know, you get to it and you're like, Holy Shit, this is where they shot that one movie. And it was pretty fun. But it's a, it's thrilling to watch what other people do with your work because you know, you, I don't do that. So I have to see how they bring it to life. It's gotta be weird.

Speaker 4:          02:23:03       It's totally weird. He made that. When they make a movie about your books, man, is that going to trip you out? Completely going to trip me out because you as the author, you see everything in your head. You know how it's exactly supposed to look. But when the director gets a hold of it and the producer gets a hold of it, they're seeing something else and they're the ones who make the pictures move. So you got to kind of go with what they go with. I mean what we're trying to do as we work toward getting infected to be a TV series and nocturnal Libby TV series is just trying to make myself indispensable to these guys. Like I'm always here. I'm always ready to answer questions and ready to go to work for you anytime you want. So that if it comes to one of those points where like I think what you want to show might not exactly be what the fans want to see.

Speaker 4:          02:23:45       Maybe you can influence that, but that's all you can hope for is to influence things a little bit because that's not your job. Your, their job is to make movie. I remember when Steven King first saw the shining, he was very upset. He was very upset with even Jack Nicholson's performance cause Jack Nicholson was crazy from the jump and he didn't want that. And he wanted there to be an arc where you see this normal guy slowly start to fall apart. Whereas he felt like Jack Nicholson was like so borderline unhinged from the beginning of the, of the movie. It was just a completely different movie than the book. And then they did that one with the dude from wings. Yup. They did the uh, the full version of it. Stephen King. But it was like, it was too late. You know, it's really hard to do. Well, they're competing against one of the icons of American film.

Speaker 4:          02:24:30       You know, the shining film is, you know, like it or hate it. That's, that's an every top, top 100 out there. Cause he's just so dramatic. Kubrick is such a bad motherfucker. I mean his movies were so incredible. He was so weird too. Like he did shit in that movie where the guy was getting blown by the stuffed animal. Like what the fuck for? He's going to turn on that shit. What the fuck? Like his movie was so weird, so strong and but the Stephen King apparently just just hated the crap out of that thing. But you never really got, I've never really got the impression just being a fan that he's all of that interested in his movie adaptations. He know he directs, he did maximum overdrive, which he was very involved in and a couple other things. But for the most part he's largely not part of what goes on in his films it seems like. So he wonder if that movie was like, all right, screw this. I got to be more paid, more attention to what's going on. Well, I think he had some huge

Speaker 3:          02:25:23       moot like carry the original Carrie, which still to this day, like they tried to do a new carry and it just wasn't what every three years now they do a new carry every three frigging ears. It just wasn't happening. The new carry sheet, first of all, she was too cute. The girl is the girl from kick ass. She's adorable. She's cute. She doesn't really like an outsider. Chloe Moretz after she moved into a town, what's that supposed to be playing, looking, you know, playing ridge, you know, and she's like this different. Yeah, the girls got old gotta be outside or different that you know, which sissy spaces, what killed it? Fucking per effect. You just believed her. I believed her in every way, you know, and the scene when they, the fucking pigs blood scene in that movie where she realized that everybody was fucking with her and she went crazy.

Speaker 3:          02:26:07       Woo. Watched that recently. It's still holds downs up. Stands up real well. That's what it. Who directed that? God. I don't know. Find that guy. I don't know what that stands up and they, I think they've, I think there have been three carry remakes. Really? Yeah. I just saw this one, this more recent one. I didn't even see it. I just saw of it and I'm like, get the fuck Outta here. Yeah. But I'm, I'm pumped for the Godzilla one. Ah, fuck yeah. Are you kidding? By the way, Brian Depalma did carry, yeah. Yeah. The new Godzilla. I, I the last guy, Dillon was such a frigging disappointment to me. I was still upset with that one. The new one looks pretty good so far on Matthew. Broderick was dreaming throughout the rest of, it was a big fat mass. Rem was way more of a Mesclun.

Speaker 3:          02:26:49       Godzilla has disappointed Pacific around. Oh so bad. Everybody was telling me it was good too. That was really weird. Real great action man. You're really gonna enjoy it. Like you can't vote, you can't vote anymore. No specific remedy like that. What's the worst smell voter? And then that one part where like the alien was pregnant at the end. It was like, I didn't get that far where I got, I got with the guy and his ex girlfriend were arguing and I was like, cut this, this, this, this is so bad. I feel like I'm watching a soap opera. So Barbara made on Mars when I was bashing it on my Twitter. There's so many people got pissed off at me. Like a lot of people that you'd have to have good fucking movie, Bro. Well, it's like we were talking about, I don't know what other people see.

Speaker 3:          02:27:27       I don't know what their perception of reality is. I have a feeling that there's a bunch of different perceptions of reality. It's just like people have different ears sizes and different brain power and d people are born with different vision. I think some people's perception of reality is fucking weird and I think that's why they like shitty music and they were shitty movies. I think the full filter that they're seeing the world through is very different than the filter that you or I may be. That filter is shaped by culture or life experience or the lack of neurochemicals that I'm enough, shit and firing and there've been, they don't eat cholesterol. Whenever they're missing, they're missing something and they see the world in a weird, shocking. That's always shocking when you watch a movie and you're like, I get this all the time. Watch a movie.

Speaker 3:          02:28:11       I'm like, oh my God, that's the worst stinking pile of crusty dog who I've ever seen. And then you'd go to rotten tomatoes. It's like 89 90% from the critics. You're like, why are you fucking people? Yeah. What did you just fucking watch? Not that. Not that I thought that it was that bad, but with the Pacific criminal thing that just drove me nuts was I paid good money to see a giant monster in a giant robot. Beat the living shit out of each other. Can you turn off the frigging rainstorm so I can see a little bit of detail on what's going on here? Everything was all grayed out. I'm like, that's not why I paid to see this. I think that you'd wanted to do that though. So they get hired. The CGI, I don't think it was that bad though. I don't think CGI was that bad.

Speaker 3:          02:28:47       CGI has kept that weird quality to it. Like when the Hulk Smash, that alien ship, you didn't really think the Hawk was smashing that alien ship. And the vendors, like you Kinda know at CGI doesn't seem real right. But if you're watching, like, did you see rush a race car moving know when they get in a fucking crash, that's a fucking crash. You know? I mean, it's the, the, the race scenes are very realistic and you feel like you're actually watching a real crash. Whereas I feel like, you know, there's some CGI that it's just like, I of, he looks great, don't get me wrong. I saw the new Thor looks great, but I know that's not really happening. Right. No, it's not happening. It looks, it's fake. It's, is it fake enough to take you out of the story? Yes. Yes it is. And it isn't.

Speaker 3:          02:29:32       You know, it, it never allows me to get really deep into the story because I know it's horse shit. Right. You know, the shit that took me out of Thor was like, knowing exactly what's going to happen, exactly what's going to happen next, kind of a thing. You know? Like, it's just hard to get into that that particular movie. Well, that's one of the things that I really loved about the new hobbit movie is that the special effects they did were just enough. I mean, there was a bunch of craziness. I don't give any spoiler alerts, but up until the time they get to the drag and there's, you know, the few silly scenes and there was a lot of fun involved and everything, but the Gr, the dragon itself was so well done and the scenes are so well lit, the whole everything about it.

Speaker 3:          02:30:08       So bad ass that you go, okay, they did it right. They did this one right. They nailed it. They really did nail it. Okay. But it's hard to do with CGI was desolation if she may have in the first one. Yes, yes. It was definitely better than the front can't, it can't be the whole movie and they, that's part of the problem with Pacific Rim is, you know, you didn't really, I didn't really care about any of those characters. I was just like, let's get out there and see these giant things. Beat the shit out of each other. Dude, that was rooting for the dragon for the last half hour. Totally ruined for the Dragon. He's my favorite person in the movie. He's clever. He's got a lot of goals.

Speaker 2:          02:30:39       And that's what pisses me off is that rotten tomatoes with 72% of that maybe are 71 south Pacific rim. And, and I just thought I lost my mind because acting was horrible. The script was horrible. The fact that like you said, like they didn't even use the sword until like halfway through the movie and that's like the best weapon that robot hat or whatever.

Speaker 3:          02:30:58       Right. So you, I want to find out rotten tomatoes for the hobbit. It'll probably go through the rough four stars. 70 76% said the Pacific rim. Well, it was way better to me at least, but that's my kind of movie I saw on the Rogan board. There's a lot of people on the message board. The fucking hated it. They said it was a piece of shit. They walked out in the middle of it. Angry little angry, angry little concern, but they weren't high command to love it. I love the trailer trailer looks amazing. There's two things. It's not as good as the first one, but the first one that's so much headroom in it. You enjoy it anyways. And the second one, like, take the goddamn camera. I'll Steve Carell. I'm like, I'm not. I know this doesn't do anything for the movie. He's good in little bits, but he had like 15 minutes of Solo screentime.

Speaker 3:          02:31:43       Someone's a corral hater. No, no, no. Not a krill hitters. Just that character was good. Good. And he's a punchline. He's not the whole, these, not the whole joke. Other than that, it's some funny shit in that movie. Well, there I am. A huge will Ferrell fan. Yeah, he could do no wrong. I love fucking the step brothers movie. Yeah, it was that moving stepbrothers was called step rose. I'm a huge towel at Knight Fan. Talladega nights is fucking hilarious. God Damn, he's funny. He's just so stupid and silly, you know, just really knows how to nail that silly character. Yeah. I've not seen anything of his, I don't like.

Speaker 2:          02:32:20       Have you seen Casa de mi padre? It's a serious one. Is Mexican movie the whole thing? He talks Spanish and it, there's no English in the whole entire movie and it's like an old Mexican movie. How old is it last year? Yeah. Oh, no shit. So it's a new movie. Yeah. I haven't heard a peep about this. This is a comedy. Yeah, it's trying to be, it didn't work, Huh? Well, I mean it's, it's very low, lower budget because it's actually, I mean, I only got 5.5 on imdbs, so it's not that good of a movie. But it was just interesting to see him actually play and not using any English through the whole movie. It was

Speaker 3:          02:32:56       remade the three Amigos. That's what he should've done. That'd be great. To Talladega nights is one of my all time favorite. It's just so stupid. It was so silly and stupid. Those movies also are good. They seem to cross generational lines. Like when I go see my brother, they want to watch. They want to watch step brothers. My nephews want to watch stepbrothers. I think it's hysterical. I know. I'm like, I know you're not getting all this humor, but that's a funny movie. While you can use, be surprised, I think any kid over 10 is probably good to go with that movie today with the Internet, they're probably good to go. They got 10. They're showing each other each other's dicks and exchanging email at the same time. You know, they can handle making someone eat a pile of poop off the lawn. It's just funny. No matter how old you are, that's a good flick. Yeah, that's good for three year olds. That'll work. That'll work for everyone in the family. Everyone. Except people were uptight.

Speaker 2:          02:33:46       Joe Have you didn't notice like the, I'm sure you have noticed the last few I've see jam man showed me this and now I can't stop looking at it as, how many people were headphones now all around their necks after every fight or four fight or anything?

Speaker 3:          02:33:58       Well, no, there's a, the new beats ones that are, uh, they're, they're wireless. Have you seen those beats studio wireless. But yeah, a lot of people are wearing like monster ones with no cords. It's just they're getting paid. Yeah. That's interesting. Well, you used to see him with those energy drinks. You're holed up to energy drink. Well, you know, I felt the fly really turned around for me in the second I actually looked. Uh, I was watching that. Uh, you got to see what my wife and we actually look looking at the headphones. You know, I looked like all the beats. I'm like, I don't think those are beats. And then we actually looked up the logo because it was a different logo for the monster headphones and all of a sudden I'm like, wow, somebody else is getting in on that action. This is cause Aryana does not want to listen to Brittany talk.

Speaker 3:          02:34:35       That's what she's got these on. They don't have any dinner, many cords in them. Brittany's talking some shit and area. I was like, bitch, I came in here. You are so pretty. They're both so pretty. Such a pretty pretty girls. Oh so pretty. But their monster beats, they're even more pretty. They like their tech now they're in the, I make them make their little heads look like animate Dallas. This is a good commercial for those monsters. The wireless ones where there's a dude who's on a team bus, he's apparently going somewhere way against Kevin girl exit the bus and then he puts those on and the music plays and they're all saying go home, go home. And he's smiling just walking past everybody's Kevin Garnett. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:35:13       He's a basketball player who used to play. You just play for Boston Celtics and I can't think who he was playing for now, but I believe the bus is going back to Boston and people are booing him. He puts those things out and he does it. It's a great commercial.

Speaker 3:          02:35:24       That's excellent. You, they should all be mouthing nick? I don't think so. I don't think so. Austin, if you really want to show what could happen, I don't really want to sell some fucking soundproof. He also brought them a chair. He helped bring them a championship, so I don't know. Yeah, but if they're really angry, Boston people trust me. They'll say, I'm comfortable with this conversation. Joel's extremely uncomfortable with all of this. Now you're an author. Come on, I'm making fiction. Putting words into people's mouths. I'm making characters the asshole racist character from Boston. Yes, and that could someday going to book and that's the bad guy. Here's a question. When you are confronted with scenarios like that, like say if you have a racist character in your film or in your role, you're a book rather and you're constructing him. Do you hold back on certain things you think other people would find offensive or do you try to paint him in as vile away as possible? Which would include someone yelling out racists, things like that. It

Speaker 5:          02:36:22       um, there's, there's, there's a self my own self checking on that and a lot of times I kind of have to get over myself like this is, this is language that I don't like and can't stand and, but this character is not me and have to get to the point where the character would actually use it. Yeah. Because that's, those people are out there and that's largely what I have to explain with my affection a ton. Like why would you put that in your book? That's not funny, or that's not cool. Like, yes, but there are people out there who do that. This is reality. There's really people like this. So to make the story feel real, we put these real assholes we have to deal with every day, put them in the book, so I'll use them. What's fascinating to me is the amount of pushback I get from over on the publisher side, the publish side, you come out with that language of the character, like we're going to have to dial that down.

Speaker 5:          02:37:07       I'm like, he's a Klan member. No, we're not going to dial that down. He's burning across, he's a Klan member. And they'll be like, no, we can't have that. And like those are one of the things, like I mentioned earlier, that's where things are. I had to put my foot down. I'm like, that's going in the book because that's real life. And people actually say that. And so that, that can get tricky. But um, if you're doing horror right or any kind of writing right, I think there's a lot of stuff you crossed that makes you feel super icky. Like, I, you know, am I influencing someone to perform these kinds of acts by putting it in the book and the most of the crazy violence shit that's always in the back of your head because my books are ridiculously violent and always in the back of your head like, okay, but what if some day some messed up kid reads my book and then says I'm going to go reenact this torture scene on somebody and am I eventually going to be responsible for that? So that's always a thought and the racist stuff is a thought too, but largely just you let it roll. Like if you think that's what a real person would do and talk like and act like, then that goes in the book.

Speaker 1:          02:38:03       That was the argument when a American psycho came out. I read it in the 80s. Um, I, when it first came out, Bret Easton Ellis, his book, it's just really fucking dark. If you think the movie's dark with Christian Bale, it is literally nothing compared to that book. That book is fucking dark. And I remember some people that I knew that had read it who were really offended, they were really angry and offended and they were saying like, this isn't good writing. He just is describing really fucked up things that make you uncomfortable. And then he goes on to the next fucked up thing and the guy just keeps getting away with shit. I didn't see that. Uh, what, what I saw was this intense view into a potentially real person. I mean, there are fucking serial killers. They do exist. They have murdered people and tortured people in horrific ways, very similar to this character. So what he's done is drag us into this really stomach wrenching, uncomfortable world. This one intense psycho, right? And it's fucking masterpiece, I think. I think it's a masterpiece.

Speaker 5:          02:39:11       Well going, you know that the, the, the process of writing in any creative realm where you're doing film or are you doing comics are doing books and going into the bad guy's head and making that bad guy live and breathe and feel like a real person. Part of that process is the bad guy. Doesn't think he's a bad guy. The super villain doesn't think she's a super villain. You know, you, these people are always morally justified in everything they do. They don't go out and commit evil. They're committing acts that are logical to them and they're being just in there. They're committed, you know, getting revenge or getting fair desserts on someone. So being able to write from the perspective of someone who's doing awful, horrible shit, but they don't think it's horrible. That's one of the tricks to doing it and that's what he did in that book is, you know, the, the main character doesn't, you don't really catch them going, I'm going to commit acts of evil.

Speaker 5:          02:39:58       He's just doing what he thinks is what should be done and wants to do what he wants and what he needs to do or what he, as we all do in human beings, those things we need to do. We find a way to morally justify them. Whatever it is that you do that you may know is a bit squishy in the eyes of society. There's some, another part of your head, the checks and balances system that goes, it's okay if you do it and here's why it's even a good thing that you do it and here's why. And that's, you know, that's what he did in that book and that's, that's part of the screwed up, screwed up part of writing. I mean, if you're just not writing superficial, good guy, bad guy snoring Dudley do right, saves a Dagon, snidely whiplash and those stories are perfectly fine and people love them.

Speaker 5:          02:40:35       But if you're actually trying to get into the point where you make that bad guy where you feel for the bad guy and empathize with the bad guy, that's tricky stuff. And my goal at the end of my books is if there's a showdown between the, the main, the bad guy and the good, the good guy and a bad guy is you're not really sure who you're rooting for if you've done it right. The reader's not really sure who they want to win that fight, even though one is morally reprehensible and the other one is supposedly good.

Speaker 1:          02:41:00       Well, you don't want to set up obvious paradigms and obvious characters that seem to have been repeated over and over again throughout time and more complex and weird and Tony Soprano, like you can get the, I mean that, that was like the Sopranos was one of my favorite shows ever. And one of the things I really liked about it was a Tony Soprano. I was a fucking murderer. He was an evil scumbag murder that you were rooting for. Yup. I mean, it was a very, very, very fascinating way that they, they danced with that. And um, I think what Bret Easton Ellis did in, in that book was completely unapologetic. And that's why I found it so fascinating because the way he described their horrific, sickening way he described these crimes was, uh, you know, I mean, it was so clinical that it almost is like done in the mind of a psychopath.

Speaker 1:          02:41:49       Like I didn't even necessarily even enjoy it. I just think he was really good. There was parts of that book. They're like the part where he shows up to clean up some bodies that he left behind and the entire apartment had been cleaned. And uh, he, he locks eyes with a real estate agent and the real estate agent is this woman who's like selling the place and she's like, I know what you did. Get the fuck Outta here. And they exchanged this look, it's a really fascinating scene of two monsters running into each other. You know, one of them were murder or the other one, a psychopath or sociopath. And they, that's one of my favorite parts of that book.

Speaker 5:          02:42:23       And both of them, I don't remember that part, but you know, you know, both of them think that they did the right thing.

Speaker 1:          02:42:28       Yeah. Did the right thing. It's going to sell that apartment for fucking 5 million bucks or whatever the hell it was. And he's got a, he was going in there to clean up the bodies that he left in the tub covered in acid or whatever the fuck he did. I forgot what it was. But, uh, yeah, those, those really evil characters that you create, that's, uh, an interesting thing for me because like, like, like this, uh, description of the guy coming down with those headphones on, you know, the guy's walking down and people yelling shit. They're obviously saying angry things. Like what would they say? Would they say fuck you? Is that okay? If you see, would your mouth that right? Would you mouth? You know, you're going to die with it. Maybe. Maybe we'll go with you. We're going to kill you. You're going to die. You're going to see him out that, but you can't say nigger, right? Don't do that. Evil people. You make an evil

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       people. That's fascinating. We can threaten your life. Right? And we can get away with like, we're going to kill you. They can mouth that in a commercial. And that's probably okay. But the other side that's totally done. No one's going to put that on too. It's just this fascinating thing about creating fiction. The fascinating thing about fiction is, you know, when you're creating an evil person, like what you're saying about will a person duplicate your ax, will they, you know, create copycat crimes? Will they, will they start like looking into your way of describing things and recreating it in a horrific way, in a real world that you'll feel responsible for? Whether it's a racist thing, whether it's a violent thing or whether it's whatever it is. You know, that's a fascinating thing to have to think about when you're creating fiction is that you, you may be reinforcing or even perhaps inspiring an idea that's ultimately very evil.

Speaker 3:          02:43:57       I think that in the instances where art has influenced people to go do something, uh, you know, those people are looking for that moral justification even though they don't know they're doing it. When the night stalker killer was out, you know, if, if ACDC hadn't wrote the song night stalker, that guy would have found something else. That guy would have found something else to, to, to validate his need to go out and kill. So that's easy for you to say. But if he did what you wrote in your Boobie d yeah. That, that would be super difficult to deal with. But I'm, you know, kind of thought this through several times cause I write some fucked up shit is, is, you know, if it happens, how am I going to feel about that? And I've already kind of, you know, like I guess I'm not a bad guy either.

Speaker 3:          02:44:37       I'm just like the people I'm talking about. I think a bad guy, I pre justified that with that guy or that girl would have found something to latch onto and would have gone out and killed based on, you know, an Anne Rice story instead of my story. Yeah. I'm, I'm very fascinated by the influence of, of something creative like that. Whether it's a film that inspires like taxi driver, which inspired John Hinckley. You know, there's, I'm, I'm fascinated by that strange link between a n a creation, a creative creation that's turned into a movie or a book and how it influences people and how you know, you can catch someone who's got the wrong fucking chemicals floating around in their brain and they read any one of your books and decide to enact a scene. And there was a guy who was arrested and in Vancouver for enacting a Dexter scene.

Speaker 3:          02:45:23       Oh yeah, he was Uighur nerd that yeah, he fucking killed somebody. Dexter dumb because I was a huge extra fan and he wound up killing somebody. I'm a huge Dexter fan. I was a huge extra fan of season one. You didn't like, they got one guy the best season though. John Lithgow. Did you not watch that season? I couldn't watch the, a bad rear naked choke. This terrible technique. Listen, I'm a Jujitsu practitioner. I know what it looks like when you choke somebody. It doesn't look like that. That was terrible. If I was on that set, if I was on that set, I'd be like, come here bitch, let me choke you. I'm going to show you what it feels like to be choked. You can't act like that. You can't act like that when you're choking or where you're not even squeezing. Interesting. This is, I'm sure this is old hat. You've been on dozens of TV sets that we did. Our first TV set ever for the,

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       for justified. We got to go there. They're shooting episode number seven because the people making justified or interested in making in fact a new series. So we get to go watch, you know Timothy Olyphant do his thing. Uh, and ones that guy, he's the, he's the Marshall Ones. Wears the hat. Okay. He testified and he was in, what was he in before it was deadwood. He was another guy who wore a hat and shot people. And then there's the other guy that's from the shield, that really good actor from the shield. It's in that as well. I don't know which guy who played like the, he was one of the cops. One of the dirty cops. Oh yeah, no, no, no. That's a Walter Goggins. He, yeah, he plays a bad guy. Yeah, he's the two of them. If you've never watched us by the two of them together are lights out for the best deal.

Speaker 4:          02:46:48       The best acting duo on TV in my opinion. Hands down. Is that a really good show? It's amazing. So good. It's so good. I don't hear about it. I don't catch in hype. It's, Oh, it's, it's catching. It started to catch on. It's head into season five, which starts tonight actually sees a five premieres on season five. So I can, I can start now and I can get four seasons. You can get forces an advertisement for justified and we snuck in an advertisement. Let's go choking. So here's, here's why you'd like it. Here's why you'd like it. It's basically the character a is a total psychopath who's wearing a batch and functions perfectly normal in society. But when it comes point to arrest the guy, instead of just pulling the gun and going, okay, put your hands up. I got Ya. He leaves the gun in the holster and he's always like, I can take in and you're going to serve life in jail or you can draw that gun and if you shoot me down, you get to walk with him anymore.

Speaker 4:          02:47:37       Don't tell him I don't want to know this. That's how dare you. I'm sorry. Spoiler Alert Guy, I'm sorry. But a son of a B that we got, we got to go on the set and the and Timothy old fonts reading the script and it's very fanboy a super cool. And then he turns out, he talks to the Mar, the real Marshall, who's been the consultant on the show for all four years. And Timothy asked him a question like, know I'm a little, I don't want my guy do this. And you could see the Marshall sweating it a little bit, cause he knows what he's gonna say. It's going to screw up a lot of work. And basically he says, yeah, you wouldn't go from point a, B, c, D and e to f if you were me, you would have just gone straight to FMN done with it.

Speaker 4:          02:48:11       And then they, you can tell they're now going to go back and do rewrites. Much like the John Lithgow thing with a bad rear naked choke. There's so, you know, there's so hoping it's going to be as realistic as possible. They're going to have to go change a bunch of crap. Yeah. That when I saw the rear naked choke, I thought I was watching like TV show from the eighties I was watching be a Vulcan nerve pinch. It was fucked. It was volcan nerve pinches more believable because Elise, she's an alien. You know John Lithgow cows, an old man with Shitty biceps killing some lady in a bath tub. It's just not even fighting back. People fight like wild animals when you're trying to kill them. Yeah, it's crazy. The unrealistic portrayal of death that took you out of the story. That's a good season though. I agree. That's a really good season. It starts terrible. Starts with the worst rear naked choke seen in the history of TV. I'm a stickler for technique when it comes to shows. Is that the girl he's choking out? Let me tell you some. It ain't that easy, bitch. Her whole right side is open. She can pay

Speaker 3:          02:49:08       it over there. He doesn't have Jack Shit. Curl it up. No that she's not fighting hard enough for faces and red like you got to. I would tell them this is a true, this is a rear naked choke though for real cause they are in a bathtub. There's no way, by the way, you get into that bathtub without anybody getting totally wet. Everybody would be soaking wet. She'd be fighting for our life and flopping around. You wouldn't get behind her naked and be able to do this. This is ridiculous. So ridiculous position. It's just terrible. Season sucks. I changed my mind crew. That show fucking bullshit. I think that Dexter just went, it started just getting weird started getting weird and not believable after like the first season. I feel look from a, from a creative perspective, once they got through season two and three maybe season four it's really hard to keep that shtick going.

Speaker 3:          02:49:55       He's the serial killer or killers, serial killers. There's only so much. The challenges to that writing team were significant. How do we keep this going because we're making money and make the best show we can it man. It had to be really hard. Well the problem is also the dude stopped looking scary. If you look at Dexter in season one, he was yoked. Yeah, he was there. There were talking about him being like a martial arts expert and he had this thick neck and traps and everything and he looked creepy and scary. You know, he looked like a guy who could fuck somebody up, but you look at him after he got sick unfortunately he got, what do you have like leukemia or something. Like he had cancer, he had to go through chemo and he was really fucking skinny for a long time and then you're like, well now not buying him rag dolling all of these people before I bought him as this really crazy super strong guy who was also a serial killer and it was just using his sickness to get rid of bad people.

Speaker 3:          02:50:44       Just like, this is a fascinating concept, but after awhile I was like, bitch, that's got to say they're holding back the cough. Yeah. Listen man, congratulations on everything.
