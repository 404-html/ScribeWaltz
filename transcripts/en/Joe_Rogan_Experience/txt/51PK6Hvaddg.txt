Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Hello everybody this weekend, Friday, December 21st, 2012. It's the end of the world show at the Wiltern theater. Honey, honey ban. Joey, Coco Diaz, Doug, Stan hope and me. Last time we checked, there was only about hello. Hello. Last time we checked, there's only about a hundred seats left. So, uh, if you want to end and no, we don't think the fucking world is going to end. All right, settle down. You really don't know. Everybody settle down. Um, also, uh, what do you got going on this week? Uh, the Improv.

Speaker 2:          00:00:36       Yes, the Improv. Thursday we're going to try to do a live podcast there, up above and while we're trying to do like a nice house chronicles, but at the Improv, it's a death squad show. Joey Diaz. It's going to be on it. Um, Jeff Richardson is going to host it. I don't know if you've seen Jeff Richards lately. He is fucking hilarious. Now. He's good and he's got the best. Uh, what's that Jimmy Fallon. Jimmy Fallon on a roller coaster. Oh, it's hilarious. It will, it will make it for yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       But, uh, I don't think I'm going to pee myself, but thanks for the plug. If you're interested, people keep asking me, where do you get those? Uh, those crazy cat tee shirts. A desk bought shirts, go to death squad. Dot TV. And uh, that also, uh, pays to support the desk. [inaudible] desk squad podcast network that Brian produces, which has the excellent Kevin Pereira. Pointless show on it now. It's a fucking great show. All those podcasts are for free. You can get them all on death squad dot t v. All right, dirty Fox. We're about to start the podcast. We have Dennis Mckenna here and we're going to get down to business. We're going to find out what the fuck is up the author of the Brotherhood of the screaming abyss.

Speaker 2:          00:01:46       Well, good experience.

Speaker 3:          00:01:48       Hey Joe Rogan podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:01:55       What's with the craziness? What are you doing with that sound? So, so Dennis Mckenna, first of all, um, and your friends, I'm sorry, I forgot your names cause we, we might've indulged in something that makes you forget things really quickly. Can you put you, if you can talk into the mic, if you want to keep the clean Keith Levers and what was that? No,

Speaker 1:          00:02:17       Katelyn Mckenna. Caitlin Mckenna. That's legacy right there. Ladies and gentlemen. Dennis, first of all, thank you very much for coming on and thank you for sending me your book. Not once, not twice but three times. Thank you, Joe. Happy to be here. I want to be sure you got a copy of the book in your hand. Yeah, I started reading it in Vegas, which I think is very ironic, you know, to be in that the, the, the darkest of places that mankind is created and a to start to read this book. But uh, as, uh, I have known of you for a long, long time. Um, I was, uh, uh, turned on to some of your brother's stuff through, uh, it was a song someone played me, not a song. I'm

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       a rave that he did where he would talk over the rave and do like his, his end of the world. End of time sort of rant. Yup. Yup. I think it was the, it was called TimeWave zero, wasn't it? Like even the, the, the, uh, the, the piece, yeah. It couldn't have been it. I mean, I know he was in several of those things. The one I remember is alien dreamed I, yes. Yes. Was that the one and only dream? Tom, wasn't that like a movie or was that the, that was the south, that was the album. I think Ken Adams actually who just recently released a movie called the Terrence Mckenna experience.

Speaker 4:          00:03:39       It's a documentary. Well, no, not exactly. I mean, it's old clips, you know, from other appearances. Pretty good. Interesting movie. Now, uh, that one clip that I'd listened to, um, really may, might have started, uh, like an entirely new chapter of my life just because it was so, it was so, first of all, it's so freaky, you know, and it was you, you never heard anyone talk that way and your brother had this really odd inflection that was like, like, uh, when, when someone is really smart and they talk with a really odd and flection, you start wondering what's wrong with you. You know, like, why am I not talking like this guy? Like maybe he's right, he's on to something here. Like they're confident is to talk like that. Well one of the things that was always sort of charming about a terrorist was that it didn't really matter what he said.

Speaker 4:          00:04:34       I mean, I used to get after him and say what you said 20 minutes ago, didn't make any sense of it directly contradicts what you just said, which also doesn't make any sense, you know. But the thing is, it doesn't matter because Terry, Terrence, he could read the phone book and it would have sounded great. That would be hanging on every word because he just had that gift. You know, he had the voice, he could mesmerize people and he was, you know, obviously super intelligent, widely read, knew all this stuff, you know, as a result of his reading and in the tussle with program and before that alchemy and you know, black magic and eastern philosophy and all of this stuff. You know, I mean, he was by far a much broader scholar than I'll ever be. I mean, I'm, I'm quite narrow. You know, I mean, I know science, that's what I know, you know, not really.

Speaker 4:          00:05:32       He was just incredible. He could draw on so many, you know, threads of knowledge and, and people were hungry to hear it. I mean, here was a guy who could say, you know, he loved provocative statements. Right. And He'd love to, you know, antagonize that, you know, make people think and people want it to be challenged, you know? And that, that was part of his appeal, I think a great deal of his appeal. I remember in the early eighties before anybody really got to knew, know who Terrance was, but he was out a few radio clips and that sort of thing. But back in the early Avs, do you remember singing along with Mitch Sing along with Mitch? What was it? You were probably too young for this. Yeah. Sing along with Mitch. It was like this really cheesy, stupid a music show with this Guy Mitch. Uh, do you remember what his last name was? I don't know, but it was all about sing along with Mitch and he would present the show and they'd sing all these old songs and he get people in the audience watching television. So sing or write. And so Terrance went on one of these programs on the moderator said, you know, you're like sing along with Mitch. Except it's like think along with terrorists.

Speaker 5:          00:06:52       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:06:52       Right. And it was like that, you know, he just stimulated people to think about things they never really thought about. So this was the show singalongs mentioned

Speaker 6:          00:07:06       there's a darn good reason why the excitement here too.

Speaker 5:          00:07:09       That was the one. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:07:13       Yeah. Marto wrong time. Shirley temple. She's new at this duty any moment.

Speaker 4:          00:07:21       Crazy. You really can't talk like that on TV anymore. People will wonder why you're talking like that. No, I know. But this was so, you know, this was way back an interesting though, that style of talking like there was like, it's a weird fake style of talking on television back then that they just don't do anymore. What an interesting show. Yeah, it was very interesting. So that was, that was really, you know, that was a big strength of terror. He was so articulate, charismatic, he was well educated and he could make whatever he was talking about make sense even or sound like it was making sense. Even limit it didn't, well he, he had so many interesting ideas that uh, opened up so many people to uh, to new possibilities. But there, there were, it was most certainly a few of them that were very, very controversial.

Speaker 4:          00:08:14       Timewave zero novelty theory being a big one, which I tried to explain this to a friend of mine once and just trying to explain it, I sounded completely crazy. I said, dude, it's a something. He was trying to figure out how to measure time through using the each thing, which is an ancient Chinese method of divination that somehow based on hexagrams and maybe a map of time, and my friend looked at me like I was out of my fucking mind. And I'm like, well, the idea is that time is like a, an algorithm somehow or not. Right. And you can track it, right. So are you, do you, are you familiar with the chain? Yes. Yes. So, so that was the framework for this idea. And, and you know, the time wave, I mean, that's one area where we had a very different perspective, you know.

Speaker 4:          00:09:07       Uh, and, uh, actually in the book I have a chapter on the time wave and I kind of unpacked the TimeWave and my own perspective on it was that, uh, you know, he postulated that the TimeWave was an actual map of time. Right. And I think that's where he overstepped the bounds. I think what really happened was he rediscovered an ancient Chinese calendar. You know, that because you can use the each thing as a calendar. There's no doubt he's demonstrated that. But if he rediscovered an ancient Chinese calendar based on the chain, that would have been remarkable. A few Chinese scholars would have congratulated him and nobody would have, you know, notice neon that, but then he, he, you know, sort of possibly this whole crazy notion about time and about how time was a fractal structure of made up of resonances. And anyway, the, the sort of, you know, the thing of interest for most people was that he had to postulate an end date and he postulated several end dates, you know, because the theory said it had to have a beginning, a middle of it. And he postulated several end dates. But the one he finally settled on was December 21st, 2012, you know, which was close enough. I mean, I mean, he actually postulated an end date that was slightly off that by some of them remember November, right? So we're talking about a cycle, billions of years, right? So he looked at that and many found out or already knew about the Mayan calendar and thought, well, they're close enough. Let's just sink these together. But there's no direct connection to the Mayan calendar other than that.

Speaker 7:          00:10:56       But didn't he say that he arrived at a completely independently

Speaker 4:          00:11:01       of the mind of the, well, the time date, he said that it was that like a little factory here arrived at a date that was close to that. Right. You know, and then, but, but also, uh, you know, during the time, there were several times in the past when he postulated and dates that, you know, we're, I'm the time I wasn't well known and there were, you know, it came and went, nothing happened and he just viewed that as part of the process of trying to, uh, to, you know, fit this thing against history.

Speaker 7:          00:11:40       Did anybody go back and reexamine the, each thing for the possibility of it being a really effective ancient Chinese calendar? Did, has anybody looked at that aspect of it?

Speaker 4:          00:11:49       Well, no one to my knowledge except terros. I mean if you, if you just split that part out, it's like it's out there though. Well, that he said that it's a calendar. Well, did Terrence believed it was like why wouldn't someone want follow up on that? I mean that it let us forget about the map of time thing, which is like really, really hard to follow. But just that aspect of it seems like it would be worth looking into it. It would be worth looking into from scholarship. Yeah, definitely. I mean, there's no doubt that it is a perfect 384 day, 13 month lunar calendar. I mean, it works very well as works as well as any other calendrical system that we have. You know, they're all, they all have inaccuracies. Um, you know, and, and that alone is remarkable. And the fee, you know, but he had this whole other theory and, and you know, the, the problem that I have with the, with the time wave theory was that, um, there was no way to quantify it.

Speaker 4:          00:12:53       This idea of novelty. I mean, I believe novelty in dresses into the continuum, but it's hard to put a number on that. I mean, it, just to look around novelty is ingressing end of the continuum and it appears to be accelerating. But maybe that's just our impression. But this was his idea. The question is how do you define a novel event? Right? Our novel events, I mean, he, he, he had the theory that novel advance suddenly erupt into history and, uh, you know, make a change. And those kinds of events are really rare. You know, I mean, asteroid impacts, that kind of thing. Yeah, those are abrupt novel events. But he used to site, for example, you know, the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima, you know, I mean that was, that had a huge impact on history. Everything after that time was different, you know, it changed our lives.

Speaker 4:          00:13:54       But was it, was that the novel event or was it the testing of the bomb and Alamogordo or Wilson, you know, Einstein's discovery of the equations that enabled this to be possible. All those things were novel events, which happened very quietly and kind of unnoticed. But if they hadn't happened this spectacular thing over here, Ashima would not have happened either. Right. So, so my view of it was that novelty kind of diffuses into history rather than the rocked into history. And pretty soon, you know, everything changes. But it changes over time and we're not even subjectively aware of it that much. What was his motivation to pursue that? Like to pursue such a strange and very hard to follow theory? Well, to pursue this timely theory? Well F two take splain that we really have to go back to, we should probably explain the TimeWave too for people don't know what the hell we're talking about.

Speaker 4:          00:14:59       There might be people that are going, what the fuck is the TimeWave Siri, right? Well, the time wave theory is this mathematical construct, you know, based on the teaching that Terrence got basically download it to him when we did the, what's it been famously known as the experiment it lot sure era, you know, which the book also talks about them, which again, a lot of PR, if you're a Terence Mckenna Fan, you know what that is. If you're not, you're wondering what the hell is this, you know, so, but the experiment that lecturer was when we, you know, well how do we explain it? I don't even know if we could go into it on the podcast, but it was something that we attempted to do. You know, when we went to, uh, South America looking for exotic hallucinogens, and this was in 1971. And, uh, we were motivated.

Speaker 4:          00:15:59       I mean, I'm sort of getting off track here, but I'm trying to bring it back to the issue of the TimeWave. We were motivated to go in 1971, basically by are interesting in fascination with DMT. I mean that was what got us going because we had, uh, encountered DMT and the hate and in Berkeley in the 60s it was very rare. You know, it's extremely not, not on the streets or anything. It was, it was hard to come by, but we had come by it and had the experience of it and thought, holy Christ that, you know, there is nothing else more interesting than this that we've ever encountered. And so, you know, we were involved in all the political turmoil and the Anti Vietnam War movements and you know, free speech and all of that. Terrence was at Berkeley. I wasn't particularly, but we, we just thought, you know, none of that is relevant.

Speaker 4:          00:17:00       This is truly the most amazing thing that we've ever encountered. And so, and so, you know, our original motivation to go to South America was because the, as you know that the smoking of Dmt is very short, right? It's 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and you'd come back and you're like, what the hell was that? What the fuck was that? You know, you, you can't bring back much from it other than just an overwhelming impression of awe and amazement and that you've looked into some other world that's more bizarre than anything you've ever seen, you know, encountered. So we thought if we could find an orally active form of, of this DMT that we, it would last longer. That was a simple rationale. It would longer and we could kind of get our sea legs there and figure out what was going on. So hilarious expression for DMT, get your sea legs, get your sea legs, just spend a little more time.

Speaker 4:          00:18:03       And, and so we read about this very obscure, uh, uh, drug prepared from a species of tree and South America. It was called Beralas and shelties, the famous ethnobotanist from Harvard wrote about, wrote, published a paper in 1970 called Varroa as an orally active hallucinate champ. Right now for role is normally used as a snuff in South America. Right? I mean, that's certain tribes, the Yanomamo and other tribes, they extract the SAP, they dry it down and they make a snuff out of it. But there were a couple of tribes that made an oral preparation from it. So that attracted our attention and we decided to go to South America and look for, you know, this, this with toto drug called Uq who hae or something like that. Oh, cool. Hey, uh, and it happened to be that the ancestral home of the wit, toto was at La Chorrera.

Speaker 4:          00:19:04       That's what led us to go to La Chorrera originally. Right. Which the search for this drug that no one ever heard of except us and our racial taste. And uh, so we went there looking for that. And uh, well at the time nobody knew much about IOWASCA. I mean I Wasa is also an orally active form of DMT, but we didn't know that at the time. And nobody did that. Maybe we can talk about that later, but uh, but we went looking for [inaudible] right when we got to Letcher era, we found that, uh, the mission village that we set up, that we stayed at the mission lodge Herrera had cleared pastors all around about a couple of hundred acres of pastures and they brought say boot cattle into this place. The white humpback cattle. Well, the shit, the Dung of this cattle is the preferred substrate for psilocybe cubensis and it was a particularly rich year that year.

Speaker 4:          00:20:13       I mean the lots of rain missed on the pasture and all that. So literally every cow pie had huge clusters of psilocybin mushrooms, uh, you know, growing out of them. All right. And again, this was 1971. A lot of people hadn't had much experience with psilocybin mushrooms, but we knew from our references let this mushroom was, we didn't, we'd never taken it, but we thought, great. Psilocybin mushrooms, wonderful s so we were delayed. We were misled, right? We thought that [inaudible] was the real mystery that we were after. It turns out psilocybin mushrooms where the real mystery and silicide than the is in fact the perfect orally active form of DMT, right? The syllabus, the active form of Psilocybin is just one mile one Adam different from DMT and it's a perfectly engineered for human metabolism. It's nontoxic, it's orally active, it's easily, you know, excrete it.

Speaker 4:          00:21:16       It's all, it's ideal. It really is. That's a perfect psychedelic in some ways. So we thought, but at the time we thought we were after. Oh, cool. Hey. So we thought, well, okay, so these mushrooms are here, this is great. While we're waiting for the real mystery, we'll we can eat these mushrooms. When we started eating the mushrooms and pretty soon and things got very weird, you know, because we were literally eating them every day and they were, they were, uh, we started having a lot of very interesting conversations, shall we say. How many days did you do this for? Oh, well, you know, uh, I mean, there wasn't that much to eat at lot. Sure. We had brought canned goods and rice and things like that, but we found that it was very easy to just kind of slip a few mushrooms into the soup. You know, they didn't taste bad.

Speaker 4:          00:22:14       So probably for a week or 10 days or so, we were pretty much taking mushrooms constantly. Wow. And, uh, and it began to suggest this experiment that we could do, you know, if it began, it, it, it the mushroom or the intelligence that spoke through the mushroom, you know, it was never quite clear, but there was definitely, it was like having a very intelligent guests at your party and you know, you didn't see it, but you definitely were in touch with it. And it began to suggest this, this experiment that we could do, I mean, this wild experiment, the experiment that lunch rare and uh, uh, we, you know, I don't know how much detail you want to go into on this, but we, we performed this experiment that the trying to get it back to the Ching and the TimeWave thing. We performed this experiment, which was something like creating the philosopher's stone essentially out of our own DNA and the DNA of a mushroom and sound and light and singing to the mushroom and coming up, you know, creating these superconducting residences and you know, I mean,

Speaker 3:          00:23:35       okay,

Speaker 4:          00:23:36       crazy stuff. You can, you can read the book, you know, but it, but we had this idea that, that we could essentially, I mean I guess I should back up and explain it. We have this idea that the sounds that you could hear on high doses of mushrooms. I don't know if your experience with Dmt, you hear things right. You often hear over tonal sounds and the whole, our old spaces as interesting as the visual space in some ways. Well on high doses of mushrooms that's similar as well. And you know, if you listen to these sounds a, you can start to sort of try to imitate them and uh, you know, he can sing along with them or you can vocalize along with them and the attempts to vocalize them or generally, you know, not so good, they're hard to imitate, but you reach a certain point where you just locked on to it and then it just pours out of you in a v in a very powerful way.

Speaker 4:          00:24:36       And in a way that's, it's like almost being possessed or something. This, this, this sound energy just pours forth. So the mushrooms suggested to us a lot of ideas about what these sounds were and how they could actually set up molecular resonances. You know, in our own brains, our own DNA and the DNA if a mushroom and that we could essentially, uh, well create in some ways create the ultimate object, create the ultimate artifact, which would be our selves, our own minds in an externalized form. The, in a physical form, the interior was single form that you could actually carry around. It would be a binding of space time and it would be, I know this is crazy. That is the highest you can get. I think that's as high as a human can get. Well there's no harm could have this thing. Well, so we had this theory about how to can, how to, how to uh, you know, induced this sound, generate this object.

Speaker 4:          00:25:48       Not only generate this but, but fix it like it Alchemy, you fixed mercury, you know, I mean that's the final step of outcome may cause this stuff was like mercury. This was like mines. It was the violet psycho fluid. We called it c, you know, this was a shared vision between the, both of you both have a shared ideational vision in a certain sense. And so that wasn't coming to you. It was the mushroom was uh, you know, the mushroom or whoever was communicating through the mushrooms was just matter of factly sort of wrapping this down. And, and you know, we were receptive to it and it was like we're writing furiously and it's like we developed this experiment, this idea, which had a whole lot of predictions. I mean crazy predictions that yeah, you would actually have at the end of the day, you would have at night more accurately, you would have a physical object that would, you know, would be outside the body, but it would be you and it would be like, and it turns out there's all sorts of precedent for this, right?

Speaker 4:          00:26:58       I mean, the idea of the outcomist stone, the philosopher's stone or the time machine, the flying saucers, the, you know, the outcome is scrying mirror, you know, that you can look into and see the future. I mean this idea haunts the human imagination that there is a way you can externalize the imagination and you know, still be it. And this thing that you would have or whatever it was, would be responsive to your imagination and it would be able to do literally whatever you could imagine that song that's sort of an alternate theory on Ufos isn't as well that you're, you're the imagination actually can conjure up a physical object and even, yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. That's what we're saying. And even young speculated about that. That's right. So, you know, I mean, I know this sounds crazy 40 years later, if it sounds crazy to me too, but at the time, and it's like this is what's going down.

Speaker 4:          00:28:04       Right? And you both agreed to it. That's what's even crazier. He two and then we made predictions about what would happen right at when we did this experiment. This is what will happen. And the predictions were such that they couldn't possibly happen because, you know, this is absurd. You can't create camp, externalize the mind in this way. But we made predictions and when those didn't happen, a bunch of other interesting things happen. Instead we had literally painted ourselves into conceptual corner where something happened to had to give. And so we both went into a prolonged altered state for like 14 days. I was smeared across the cosmos. Literally, you know, I, I was, I hearkened back to a recent period when I'd smoked DMT and my entire mind was coke contiguous with the, you know, boundaries of space time. And Terrence became extreme know he became complimentary to that.

Speaker 4:          00:29:10       He became extremely hyper vigilant and a very focused on our place. And being like the anchor, like if I was out there in the cosmos, he was the beacon that was bringing me home and our companions, these poor people thought that we were completely nuts, you know? And they were not participated. The locals? No, no. The two people that we'd gone where it was like they had stepped back from it. So they were so earlier. Oh, well yeah. Oh, that must've been so we were like, oh, it was very strange for them. I'm sure she is too strange for us, but we were making sense to each other. There's actually a term in this for a psychology in psychology. It's called the Folia do. It's the, it's the, the folly of two simultaneous, you know, psychosis essentially. But it wasn't a psychosis. That's the thing people have to understand.

Speaker 4:          00:30:17       It wasn't a psychosis. If anything, it was closer to a shamonic initiation. I mean, the motifs of shamanic initiation more than the motifs of psychosis fit what went on. We were transformed and we were transformed in a complimentary way. And we also reintegrated more or less, uh, you know, so that, I mean, I'm fairly functional now. I don't know that I've ever totally reintegrated, but you know what I mean? It wasn't a shamonic initiations where you go through this metamorphosis and things are done to you and you're torn apart and year changed, but then you're put back together in a different form. And, and that's really what happened. But I wasn't put back together as the, you know, super conducting, uh, you know, bionic creature with access to all information and all space and time that didn't happen. Uh, you know, and, and so to try to bring this around to whether the TimeWave, the TimeWave came about because Terrence was, you know, in this hypervigilant state where he didn't sleep for 14 days, you know, he was watching over me for one thing, cause I tended to wander off and you know, I was completely three sheets to the wind, literally, you know, and, and often this, this cosmic fantasy world, but he was very focused, but he started making, um, making charts of time.

Speaker 4:          00:31:58       He was trying to predict. We had done this experiment and we had predicted that the stone would can dance in this physical form. And at the end of the experiment, that didn't happen. But we were getting the message that we did everything right. It's just your timing that's off and it will come right. The stone will condense at some points. But so it became this whole game sort of of trying to predict when will the stone can dance. And so Terrence begin charting our course, you know, and he, he found like he was, he counted back 64 days, two types of 64 days to the, to the, uh, you know, from the date of the experiment. And it turns out that was the date of our mother's death the previous October. Right? And then he started counting forward from that date, several cycles of 64. And it turned out that was his birthday in 1971.

Speaker 4:          00:33:02       So that became a sort of focus for predicting when it would condense. That course came and went. So over the years, he tried to find, I guess, fine tune this prediction, fine tune this. And that's what the whole elaborate TimeWave theory grew out of. You know, if, if there was an alien artifact that was given to us by this experiment, then it was this, it was this mathematical construction, you know, which wasn't given to me. It was given to him. What was given to me were, uh, you know, uh, I mean the experience, uh, of, of, you know, being smeared over the cosmos and then gradually over 14 days basically condensing myself back into a body and eating. Was I eating? Uh, I don't know. Uh, I guess somebody was feeding me. I mean, I wasn't doing those things. Uh, it was, it was someone must've fed me. Do you remember going to the bathroom? Do you remember? I don't, but you know what? I remember I remembered that I was in hyperspace. I was coke contiguous. Uh, I shared topology with everyone. So if I wanted to take a shit, for example, I would ask my friend to take a shit.

Speaker 4:          00:34:30       Wow. I could, you know, and the, and I could eliminate that way because our typologies, we're joined. Or you know, if I wanted to smoke a cigarette, I'd ask Vanessa to smoke a cigarette and I could all, all those kind of crazy, just like a cigarette for you, please.

Speaker 7:          00:34:49       Right. I mean, I know this sounds crazy, I shouldn't even be talking about, no, you should public. Do you subscribe to the idea that like these ancient cultures like the Mayans and, uh, these, these people that have these incredible structures that are very likely this was suicide and induced or their culture was so Simon induced?

Speaker 4:          00:35:13       Well, I, yeah, I do. I think there's a good chance that it was a, I mean, I think that that wasn't the only, that certainly wasn't the only name in theologian that the Mayans knew about, but that was an important one. What else should they know about? Well, they knew, they knew about it a lot. They do about, you know, they knew about all the Central American ones, the morning glories, Olo, leaky, the, you know, probably Salvia, probably all of those. But the Mayans definitely knew about mushrooms. And, uh, I think it's likely that mushrooms, you know, I mean, if, if you, if you talk about the stoned ape theory, you know, it's, you've talked about, and Terrence is talked about, it's most likely mushrooms, you know, that because mushrooms are pan global, they're found in every, every climate, you know, if it's tropics, it's stiff.

Speaker 4:          00:36:07       It's, I lost Sufi cubensis if it's temporary, it's so lots to be semi Ilan Siada. But these things are all over the place. They're potent. They don't require any preparation, right? No technology needed other than the curiosity to bend over, pick it up and munch and you know, and once you do that, then the impact, it had to be profound. You know? And, and, and we're talking about omnivorous primates here who are hungry all the time, very acutely keyed into their environment. I mean, it's not like they're going to overlook things, right? So they'll see it and they'll eat it, test things. And they are exactly, exactly. They, they're omnivores and they test things. And so they test this and then they get the, the message, you know, and I, I think that, uh, you know, I mean, and the stoned ape theory there, there are things that are puzzling to me that I, I totally don't completely understand.

Speaker 4:          00:37:11       It's like, you know, we were near, you know, if you, if you look at the archeological evidence for the critical period when consciousness emerged in our species, except for a couple of indications that go way back like half a million years, but, but, uh, you know, the efflorescence of artistic expression, which is really the only way you can tell happened sometime between a hundred thousand years ago and 8,000 years ago. You know, you look at the cave paintings and some of the oldest ones, the Blombos cave in South Africa goes 80,000 years. That was clearly, those artifacts were clearly done by conscious beings within artistic sense. You know, so if that equates to cognition, but then the, the, you know, then clearly consciousness was happening, you know, somewhere after a hundred thousand years, up until now, presumably, you know, consciousness was happening. But if you look at the fossil record, the neurologically modern brain was much older than that, you know, I mean, essentially, you know, at least a hundred thousand, maybe 200,000 years older than this emergence of, you know, the neurologically modern brain with all the apparatus needed to generate language, right?

Speaker 4:          00:38:42       And it's all about language and it's about this making this connection between sound, image and symbol, you know, meaningful symbol. And, and I've argued in, uh, a lot of lectures and so on. I mean, my shtick, if you will, that what this is what this amounts to is synesthesia, right? Synesthesia. It'd be in the translation of one sensory mode to another. Well, like psychedelics do, right? Psychedelics reliably induced synesthesia where you can hear colors and see sounds, that's the most reveal aspect of it. Um, most people can't do that without psychedelics, but some cam, some are genetic, some people are genetically synesthetic. And their experience of meaning and language is a, is very different. Uh, it's interesting that synesthesia in genetically synesthetic people is often associated with languages and language and number, you know, so they'll say crazy sounding stuff like, you know, the letter c is hard and chrome color, you know, and they're think they're speaking in the abstract, but this is a, uh, an actual perception for them or you know, the, the, they'll talk about the personality of the number nine. Whoa.

Speaker 7:          00:40:13       Now these functional, these kinds of, some therapy, many of them are brilliant. Yes. They're totally functional. So they're seeing all this around them all the time, but they can still manage the way to move through it. So they're essentially walking through a living mushroom trip.

Speaker 4:          00:40:30       Yeah, kind of in a sense. I mean, I think they are aware of their sort of cognitive environment, if you want to put it that way. Uh, uh, the one, the same one that we inhabit, but a lot of this stuff goes into the background for us. Right. And less we take a psychedelic or something like that and then it comes out into the foreground. It goes on in the background that that's essentially what I'm saying, the process of understanding language is this process of synesthesia that we're not even aware of. Right? Where we have, we live in, we live in a world in which abstractions and symbols are as real as you know, anything in the outside world. Right? And we live in a world in which symbols have significance and that is the basis of language. We are our ability to perceive meaning.

Speaker 4:          00:41:28       Uh, and it's based on this sort of unconscious synesthesia which we do all the time. And uh, mushrooms may, I mean, with respect to the evolution of the primate brain, I what I, what I think I'm postulating that, you know, something like mushrooms, we're able to trigger these types of synesthetic experiences it people and they essentially became training tools for learning cognition, training tools for learning. You know, how to associate meaning with meaningless sounds and essentially meaningless symbols, meaningless visual cues and oral cues. But it made the essential connection to significance, the feeling of significance.

Speaker 1:          00:42:20       It's, you know, am I making any sense? Yes, absolutely. So that's the mechanism involved of taking an intelligent thinking, lower primate and turning it into a human being. Right, exactly. One they, and give it a lot of mushrooms and see what happens.

Speaker 4:          00:42:37       Well, yes, of course. My God, that's all I want to do. Right. I just feel like there's gotta be something to that. Right. But it doesn't happen abruptly. It's happens over time, right? Just have a whole farm. Well, yeah, but Shannon, but again, I mean there are other things going on. There are, there are, you know, I don't know if it said climatological factors, criminological factors, maternal inheritance factors, you know, I mean, this is a whole other area of, we do, you know, really

Speaker 1:          00:43:09       described the theory for people that don't know what the higher primate theory is, or excuse me, the, um, that's my, uh, that's his tee shirt here. The, um, the stoned ape theory is that siliciden mushrooms or psychedelic mushrooms were responsible for creating human beings. And the one of Terrence's assertions was that, uh, the, the doubling of the human brain size, it occurred over a period of about 2 million years. And that this correlates to the timeline of, uh, these, uh, rain forest receding into grasslands. And then these monkey, you know, the apes, uh, experimenting with different food sources that does, that. Does that stuff all jive with like core samples and like climate studies and cause all that stuff the same time with the human brains has doubled is at all legit? Well, yeah, it's pretty much legit. I mean, we know that there were, you know, I don't think you could put your finger on any one factor and say this was responsible for the expansion of the human brain, but definitely the transition from our boreal to to plain type existence existence on the Serengeti, uh, was a time of incredible environmental stress for these, for these primates and the whole environment.

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       They had to adapt and they had to, you know, learn a hold of diet, a whole new mode of existence. And it's not clear at the timeframe that, that this took place over. But I, I think that, uh, and, and it's, and it's not clear how much of it just happen. I mean, it's not clear that this necessarily triggered consciousness, but it certainly triggered adaptations, uh, in, in these primates that, you know, they were, they were forced into so that perhaps got them ready when the time, Kay, it's, it's, I mean, that's the part that's difficult to predict or nail down. How long, how far back were these mushrooms used? You know, was it a transient thing or did the climate change, you know, there, was there a point around a hundred thousand years ago where the climate in that area got much wetter and suddenly these things became more, uh, more common, or were they always there and you know, it's, it's, it's difficult, but I think one of the characteristics that we do know about psychedelics is that they, they can induce this feeling of what's been called portentous snus, right.

Speaker 4:          00:45:52       The feeling of a feeling that I've experienced something is significant. So feeling of reverence or awe or, you know, all of those things that we associate with religious sense abilities. You know, it's not that psychedelics, you know, there are religions that have been founded around psychedelics, obviously the mushroom cults and all of these things, but psychedelics are not a religion. They are in a sense the religion or they, they, they hit those parts of our brain that are capable of having religious religious responses in some way. And so when you get that going, um, then you have these primates with a sense of being in touch with some, you know, in touch with some transcendent other that is more significant that themselves, that, that they feel a longing for. And I think that's the religious sensibility and that that's also what, what drives our species forward, you know, is this, is this longing to know the unknown essentially.

Speaker 4:          00:47:10       You know, I mean the Terrance talked about, and actually Rudolf Otto talked about the psychedelics are a mysterium tremendum, right? Rudolf Otto talked about this. They are a tremendous mystery that is terrifying and fascinating at the same time. And, uh, this has been the continuing carrots that's, that's pulled our species forward, you know, and, and my lectures, I sometimes liken them to the ID of the monolith in 2001. If, you know, Kubrick tried to concretize that idea and the idea of the monolith, something that's utterly alien, totally incomprehensible, completely terrifying and fascinating, right? They can't take their eyes off of it and it inserts itself into history or evolution at critical junctures. It just shows up, you know, and things happen. And I'm saying we don't need to invoke the monolith because that's what the psychedelics in nature, our, you know, our own builtin monolith, you know, built into the biosphere.

Speaker 7:          00:48:26       Do you find it frustrating that that's not considered

Speaker 4:          00:48:29       mmm bye.

Speaker 7:          00:48:31       Standard people of science when they discuss theories of evolution, the, I mean they'll, it's really strange to me. I find how they factor it out. Yeah. It's weird how they, uh, there's obviously a bunch of different factors. Cooking meat, eat the throwing arm, you know, there's a lot of different factors, but why would they not consider that as well? That's always been really confusing to me. And the only thing that makes sense is that they haven't done it.

Speaker 4:          00:48:59       There you go. You're just sending an insight there. But I mean even, you know, um, um, Graham Hancock talks about this, the uh, the person that wrote this very interesting book about the cave paintings, the mind and the brain. This is the name of the book. I forget the author at the moment, but this very well respected, you know, South Africa scholar who wrote a book about how altered states in, you know, in the, you know, shamonic rituals carried out in the dark or in the almost total darkness in these caves. That's what the cave paintings were about. These things were painted by people in highly altered states doing shamanic ceremonies. But even the guy who wrote the book will not take mushrooms. You know, Graham Hancock attempted to get him to, I mean he wrote about his work with great enthusiasm and evaporation. You know, if you want to confirm your theory, this is what you do.

Speaker 7:          00:50:05       Why is it that did do it though? If he did do and did do it publicly, it would, it would hurt him. And in in an academic sense.

Speaker 4:          00:50:12       Well w do you know what that's probably why he didn't do it. Why would it hurt him? I mean it seems to me it would hurt him because drugs are verboten. Yeah, no, but in fact that is the honest thing

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       to do as a scientist and, and I think if enough of the right people, you know, the people in this field actually would let themselves have this experience. I think the controversy with resolve itself because those of us who have experienced it just seems obvious. It just seems, it's very strange to me that it's not considered even as a factor at all. When if you've had the impact, you've had the experience personally, you know, the incredible impact that it has, how could that not be considered in terms of something that affects consciousness? If you're, you're talking about someone who has no science, someone who has no books to read, someone who has, you know, whatever language existed at the time. Having a blowout psychedelic experience would be so staggeringly profound on the shaping of your vision of the world. But it's weird that it's not considered.

Speaker 1:          00:51:22       And it's really a shame as far as the way the people that educate people in this world, whether it's in high school or whether it's in universities or colleges, that they're, they personally are not aware and or have been educated by this experience because it's, it's not what everybody thinks it is. That we, everyone has this idea that it's an escape from reality. You're running away from things, you're clouding things up with the drugs and that the, because it's under this one blanket, this one blanket of description drugs, it's, it's really weird that it's not considered as a factor in the development of the human being. No, well exactly because of the rubric kits put under, I mean people, it's one of these things that exists in the shadow, you know, it's, it's in the shadow and, and the reason it's in the shadow is because it is a true mystery and true mysteries are freighted with numinosity, right.

Speaker 1:          00:52:22       With the numinous and you know, I mean, despite the lip service that the church pays to all this stuff, I mean, the main mission of the church is to ensure that people do not have genuine religious experiences. Right? I mean, that's the most dangerous thing to the, to the church that there could possibly be. If someone bypasses all the priests and the whole, you know, hierarchical structure and just goes out and talks to God, well, God's going to give you a different message than the priests are giving you. I tell you, you know, that's dangerous. It's dangerous. What did you think of John Marco? A allegro is work, the sacred mushroom in the cross. His assertion that he, for, for the folks who don't know this one, just a brief one, he was a scholar who was a, an ordained minister who became a theologian. As he was PR studying theology. He became a agnostic and reviewed according to him, the Dead Sea Scrolls and believed at the end of 14 years of studying it, that it was essentially the

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       entire Christian religion was about psychedelic mushroom use and fertility cults. And he wrote this book called the Sacred Mushroom and the cross and it's his, that's his assertions that Jesus actually was a mushroom. Well, I dunno, I dunno if Jesus was a musher, but I do think that, uh, [inaudible] was a serious scholar and I think he, I think it's a shame that he was vilified the way he was because he was a philologist. Right. He was a specialist in these, in these aromatic languages. He was one of the people appointed, one of the scholars appointed pointed to the translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls. And he was incidentally, apparently according to Andy relevant and people like that, he was the only one who wasn't a priest on this committee for one thing. So he was immediately sort of outside the officially approved circles, I think to the, I'm not a philology list, but I think to the extent that, uh, I mean, Eh, you know, so I'm not really qualified to interpret whether his scholarship was together or not.

Speaker 4:          00:54:36       Uh, he was, well, it, he was well enough qualified to be appointed to this, to this translation committee. So he must've had something going for himself. And when he and his, his account is, he says, honestly, you know, when I reviewed all this stuff and began to put two and two together, it seems that there were all these illusions to fungi and you know, to mushrooms and, uh, I didn't come to this with this agenda. That's what sitting here, and he was a straight guy too. He was a straight guy. Yeah, he was a straight guy. So I, I think that he was a good example of an honest scholar who honestly reported what he found and who his message was unacceptable. And so the, you know, the establishment, the powers that be, the higher authorities decided basically he had to be destroyed and he was, his reputation was thoroughly trashed.

Speaker 4:          00:55:38       Uh, uh, you know, now is it true? I mean, it was Jesus a mushroom. Did they use Amanita miscarry or some other mushrooms? I think it's likely, uh, you know, we know that the, uh, the Gnostics, which is the pre Christian or quayside Christian group, out of what you know, that wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls out of which Christianity supposedly sprang, um, they have a lot of very peculiar notion and notions that would be considered heresy by, by, you know, Christians now. I mean, I mean, the God of, of, uh, of the Bible of Genesis was seeing that Gnosticism as an evil entity, right? Because it was keeping keeping humanity in prison in, in the world of matter, when the soul long to be liberated into the light and all that. So that was his view of this whole thing. That was not a Legros view, but that was the view of gnosticism. That's a pretty psychedelic vision right there. You know, and I, I wouldn't surprise me at all if this group, you know, I was, uh, was using either, I'm an eight, a miscarried and, or some kind of psilocybin mushrooms to craziest quote from the book was that he had translated the word Christ back to an ancient Sumerian word, which meant a mushroom covered in God's seaman.

Speaker 4:          00:57:14       Yeah. Wow. I mean, that's a,

Speaker 7:          00:57:18       that's a heavy one. Yeah. Especially for a guy is not doing drugs. Yeah. I straight academic to do this is what I got. Right. This is what he had and he had

Speaker 4:          00:57:30       to be discredited because that wasn't the message that, you know, but uh, but it's weird that she wouldn't be surprised. I mean, the church has been suppressing stuff, you know, for years. I mean, I mean, look at the Bible. The Bible is, I very select compendium of gospels, but there's a lot of material that never made the cut as we know.

Speaker 7:          00:57:54       It's weird that to me, that with the incredible power that the psychedelic mushrooms must have had on ancient people, we know people have been taking them for a long time. We don't we, we, we know for sure they existed. How are they not being used all throughout these religions today? Like how did, how did all the different intellectual societies of this world lose touch with perhaps the very thing that gave us our initial intellectual curiosity? Like how did that happen? How could it happen that at the highest levels of learning, which is where we're at in 2012 if you, you know, if you follow a linear timeline, this is advanced as we've ever been. So if that is the case, how is it possible that it's removed from CNN and the New York Times? It's not something that's being not just a once in a blue moon John Hopkins study, which shows that it improves your personality, but some legitimate consideration too, that it might have been a factor in why we're here and we're one of the reasons why we're so fucked up.

Speaker 7:          00:58:56       One of the reasons why our society is so crazy is because we're detached from one of the very things that might have created this human being in the first place. That seems to me to be something that should be considered. It's, it seems to me like if you look at all the other factors like eating meat and the throwing arm and you know, figuring out complex problems and hunting and all the things that could have happened, how could you not be looking really closely at this one mushroom that makes you see incredible visions, explore realms that seem realer than this real, this reality that we live in right now. The only reason is because either you're, you're, you're, you haven't experienced it or you have experienced it and you're terrified and you're trying to keep everyone else from it. Those are the only two. So we're, you know, I think it's more the latter.

Speaker 4:          00:59:49       I mean, I think you know what, we have to understand the proper venue, if you will, or the proper human institution to kind of be the steward of this mystery. It's a real mystery, right? The Cape, even though we understand a lot about the neuroscience, we can talk about neurochemistry of receptors and all that. That does not make the connection or cross the bridge between what we experience when we take it. We, we know all about the, the underlying neurophysiology of it, but it still doesn't bridge the gap to what we actually experience. Right? So it's important. So it, so I say it remains a mystery as, as does the very, you know, conundrum of consciousness. You know, how does the brain mind generate or experience consciousness. But you know, it is a genuine mystery and human institution and properly should be the province of religion.

Speaker 4:          01:00:49       But religions don't serve that anymore. Religions or political institutions, right? I mean they, they, if they have a real mystery, they want to put it in a box and put it over here someplace and keep people from it. You know, because that gets in the way of Promo gating the doctrine and the doctrine is, you know, told the line, don't ask too many questions, have faith or I, you must have faith, which generally means, which means essentially you have to believe a lot of stuff. We tell you that for which there's no evidence. That's another part of them. You believe it because we tell you to believe it. So have faith. Uh, don't ask too many questions. Uh, you know, and, and basically told the lights. So they're their political institutions. Religions are there into bludgeoning people into a certain mode of behavior and they work in conjunction now in our culture with governments and corporations and to have people, you know, taking mushrooms and, and having all these funny ideas and questioning the status quo. This is not, this doesn't serve the agenda, you know,

Speaker 7:          01:02:02       let the people who are making the agenda, how many people really truly have had the experience as it is it a very few. So is it, is it that they don't want these people having that and, and, and you know, thinking about things and coming up with new solutions and trying to reshape society? Or is it complete ignorance and just trying to suppress it because it's, it's in their best financial interest?

Speaker 4:          01:02:25       Well, that's hard too. That's really hard to know. I mean, whether they do it out of ignorance or whether they were there, there's a more sinister agenda, which is, you know, perhaps some of them have had this experience. And, and realize that for people to be having these types of experiences, a threat to the status quo because exactly as you say, it motivates us to change the way we are, to change the way we relate to the world. You know, and we're no longer good producer consumers. You know, we don't fit into the agenda anymore. I mean, I think it's ironic, you know, it just, in a way, you know, back in the 60s, DMT used to be called the businessman's trip, right? The idea was you could smoke it on your lunch hour and get back to work after your lunch hour, except that after you've smoked DMT, who would even want to go back to your cubicle? You know? So they're inherently, uh, you know, subversive in a, in the sense that they encourage people to take personal responsibility for themselves and think for themselves. Thinking for oneself. Is it

Speaker 7:          01:03:35       discouraged activity these days? There's also the issue of a lack of guidance in this country, especially when it comes to these different things because of the fact that they're illegal. There's a lot of misinformation. There's a lot of misinformation. Don't understand how to use them. They don't understand where they're going to get them from the, it's right. If there was like, it would be amazing if we had shamonic institutes or people would go and there would be someone who could literally guide you along. I mean, if we were really an intelligent culture that trusted each other as grown adults with the ability to make choices and, and have educated choices, we, you know, it just seems like we're missing out.

Speaker 4:          01:04:21       Well, I give it 20 years. I do. I think, I think that despite all the resistance, that's probably where it's going. I mean, it will happen in a very subtle way and it won't attract a lot of attention. But I think that I, you know, until it's a done deal in a sense, I think that what we're witnessing now is that with this psychedelic renaissance, you know, and it's six days and all that, that's all gone. But now and a lot of the hysteria has died down and now we're in a position to revisit this whole thing and take a second look in a calmer way. And I think a lot of the research that you see happening is going to, I mean, I know the, I, the work, the institution I'm affiliated with on that respect as the Heffter research institute, people should check that after.org um, because most of the leading researchers in, in psychedelics are on our board.

Speaker 4:          01:05:25       Rider either on our board are supported by or by halfed area to some degree. Uh, but the work that people like Roland Griffiths or doing their other investigators, but he's well known, what he's doing is, is the way you opened the door, right to the use of these things is two paths, either religious or medicine. You know, if you could find a legitimate medical use for silicide, then that changes everything because that means that the FDA can be pressured to change the scheduling of it. Once the scheduling of it has changed, it's now scheduled one. Right. And the first criteria, and it was scheduled, one is a dangerous drug with no possible medical use. Well, if you do good rigorous science and you do several clinical studies, which is what they're doing with the silicide when end of life kind of approach to it, helping people to come to terms with their impending death and deal with the anxiety and they may, you know, spiritual crisis around that.

Speaker 4:          01:06:34       That's essentially what they're using. But if you can show legitimately that it has a use in that respect, then you can change the regulatory framework. You can, you can actually get it approved for that use. Once it's approved for that use, you have to change the scheduling of it from schedule one to probably schedule too. But then you open up the possibility of off label uses, right? As with any drug and then therapists can start to use it. And I think that you will see in 10 years, maybe you will see exactly that. You will see institutes, places where you can go. I mean, the next step is to say, well, sill, if psilocybin can benefit dying, people maybe can benefit. Well people, maybe it can help. Well, people, people who are not sick come to PTSD. Uh, another example, you know, but just spiritual evolution, just a discipline, you know, uh, which is what shamanism is. People have to go to South American now to find this stuff, you know, and they do. And a lot of them go there because they're not finding any spiritual satisfaction in our own institutions. So what we have to do is create our own institutions that are not copies of South American shamanism, but our own, you know, our own Neil shamanism in a sense the borrows from these different traditions. But that works for us, you know, works in our culture. Do you see

Speaker 7:          01:08:16       the lack of a changing of the classification of marijuana? It's still scheduled one, despite all the evidence of his medical uses for that. Do you find that as like discouraging? And if anybody hears that noise, that's Dennis play with velcro. Okay. Don't get mad at us and say that some static electricity because people will get mad and send like a hundred Twitter masters. I'm so sorry you're showing fucking stone it. Sorry, I'm a fiddler. What can I say? Don't worry about it. But deep back to the question, do you see that the, um, the classification from marijuana, which still, despite all the evidence to the contrary, even some really interesting stuff about cancer, you know, some all that Rick Simpson, hemp seed oil and, or I guess it's really hash oil. It's cause it is psychoactive belts hash and he calls it hemp oil. I guess maybe to make people feel better about it. Whatever it is, they're there. The work that that guy's done and all the different studies that have shown the what it does to for Glaucoma patients, we had duds for wasting syndrome and people will have a hard time. Why is it there no change in the classification of that because it seems like there's a good body of work that shows some medical uses for it. Especially when you consider the cocaine and schedule too.

Speaker 4:          01:09:29       Right. Cocaine is scheduled too because it hasn't recognized medical use. Right. That's hilarious. Well, yeah, I mean the, the whole situation in a way is I think with respect to cannabis is, is somehow different because it's so freighted with political considerations. I mean that don't really play the psychedelics to the same extent because even though we're immersed in this world of psychedelics and we think it's important, we're still talking, you know, two, 3% of the population at most. If that even gives a shit about psychedelics, marijuana is like 60% of the population. So I just think you're seeing,

Speaker 3:          01:10:17       yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:10:18       You know, I mean, I don't know. I think the pharmaceutical cartel in some ways is lined up against this because medical marijuana is potentially so useful for so many things that they're making money on right now by making drugs to treat them. And you know, if you look at their research efforts, if you look at what's going on in the back room and they're not talking about, they're totally into cannabinoid chemistry, right? I mean they're developing all kinds of pharmaceuticals, but those are patentable compounds that they can own and produced synthetically and charge you a lot of money for. So I think that pot is a threat to the hitch devotee of the pharmaceutical cartels. That's one thing. I think the government is kind of deer in the headlights about it, you know, as the Obama administration's to the latest legalization. I mean finally they're beginning to get their act together. I would say the right thing, which is okay, apparently this, we'll just let this social experiment go forward and see where it goes, which is the right thing to do. And I think if they do that, you'll see it evolve toward. Other states will say, well, Washington and Colorado legalized pot, they didn't collapse and they're making a lot of money off taxes. We want some of that. We'll do that. So I think he'll see it change over time.

Speaker 7:          01:11:47       But I would agree with you. But what, look what Obama did in the first administration is his first years with the DEA. The Dea busted a lot of pot clubs where he said he wasn't going to do that. I know, I know. He said he wasn't going to do that. And that's even grosser. What they do, what they actually do. I know a bunch of people that have been busted. They take all your money, they take all your pot and then they say your case is pending and they do nothing. They just, they just rob you. They essentially rob you and stop you from doing business and scare the shit out of you so you to do it again. But because you're not violating state law, they don't really pursue you. They just steal from you. They just show it down. They just ruin you financially and every other way and physically because you're going to be freaking out cause you're thinking you might have to go to jail cause federally what happens is when you are not violating state law, but you are violating federal law when you go to trial, they don't even let you use the term medical marijuana.

Speaker 7:          01:12:42       It's not allowed to be used in court. It's an admissible. So there is no medical marijuana in the eyes of the federal government. So you can't even defend yourself by telling the people in the jury that you were not in violation of a state law. It's incredible and it's really a terrible crime on humanity. I mean that's really what it is. And the government is essentially a criminal cartel. And the way that the, and the way that they handled this, the question, you know, putting people in jail that do not, not only do they not deserve to be in jail, they haven't done anything wrong or they're providing people with something that they want and they're doing it according to a law. It's a state law. And that is a real sickness. When people think that they're vindicated or justified in some way for locking those people in cages. Those are the real criminals. That's the real criminals in our society is that people that are locking people in jail for pot, and that's a real sickness and a real end of the hypocrisy is just so outstanding and everywhere in every bar and every drug store, everywhere you go, there's alcohol, and yet you're going to lock these people in a cage for doing something that's not nearly as bad. That's insane.

Speaker 4:          01:13:50       The here's the thing. Yes, it's everything you say is true, but the thing is the people see through this. The fact that you could get this vote in Washington and Colorado is a very hopeful thing. If they will let it go forward, then over time they'll begin to see the benefits of that. Right. In the sense that exactly as you say, pot smoking is not nearly as harmful as alcohol, so you'll see reduced traffic fatalities. You know, people may be driving stone but they are safer drivers. Or if they're stone, then they, if they're, if they're intoxicated, you'll see reduced incidences of domestic violence and other kinds of violence. You'll see that actually letting people smoke pot alleviates a lot of societal problem and it won't eliminate that. But you'll see statistically significant reductions in a lot of the parameters that you know, because we know that alcohol re, you know, fuels violent behavior at fuse, it fuels domestic violence, traffic accidents, all this stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:14:58       Those things will be reduced if people start smoking pot in place of that. You know, I guess I'm just disappointed in the fact that it's taken so long that I become kind of cynical to how the, the, the way the government approaches it because it just seems so ridiculous at this point. Well, it does seem ridiculous and it's like the emperor has no clothes. I mean it's like this policy has so long been in placed and there's so much inertia behind it. Right? There's the whole law enforcement infrastructure, you know, the DEA, the prison industrial complex, the, you know, I mean, so many things depend on, it's not just the drug cartels. I mean, and their profits go away. But the whole governmental infrastructure to support the prison guards union, all of those things, they're enormously threatened. They don't want things to change. You know, the last people who wanted to see pot legal is drug dealers.

Speaker 4:          01:15:56       Their profit margins go out the window. I don't think they really lobby that much though. I don't know. No they don't. But you know what I mean? And the government has a big investment in the current, you know, situation. I feel if anything, the one thing that's going to change everything is the internet. It's just the access to information is so complete now that there's really the, it's, it's too hard to maintain an ignorance. Right. And for people, for the government to maintain that marijuana has no medical application is just absurd. I mean, it's just absurd. Although they, they do everything they can to discourage research. You know, out of one side of their mouth, they say, well, we want people to apply for grants and we encourage research, but then they make it impossible to get legitimate sources of cannabis to do the research.

Speaker 4:          01:16:48       So, which is it, you know, uh, so it is a, it's a bad situation. But, uh, but I would say this, I would say that we have to remember, you know, we have to take a longer term sort of view of this and we have to remind ourselves that we are witnessing a what were, what is really going on here is a coevolution, you know, between us and these plants. And this has been going on for, we don't know how long, a hundred thousand years at least cannabis is among those plants. Right? And, and so if you take a small slice of historical time and say, what is our current, you know, species relationship with these plants, it does look very good. You know, they're being suppressed and all that. But it's a small slice of time in the end, the plants when, right? Because this is what's going on. The plants when you cannot eradicate cannabis from the face of the earth, much as they might want to and they really don't want to, you know, there's just a small

Speaker 7:          01:17:56       group that are profiting from it being illegal and they would like to continue to do so. They wouldn't let you continue. Yeah, we'll change. It will change over time. You know, I, I really think so. Yeah. I guess like I said, I think I'm frustrated by the fact that it's taken so long. But yeah, but that's also because so many people have had to suffer needlessly. People that are in jail loud don't belong. This terrible case about a guy in Montana who was a grower who was following the state law, even had a state law enforcement authorities on a regular basis come out to his grow houses and he showed them what he was doing is providing for all these different patients in Montana. And this guy's up for eight years in jail. You know, he's, he's up for more in jail then he would be, if he killed somebody, you know, jails 25 to life for murder and this guy is 80 years is as potential sentence.

Speaker 7:          01:18:48       It's insane for growing some plants that the state approved. The state made a law. They approved it. He was there. He brought the state people in. They said, Yup, everything's good. Brought the state police in. Yup. Everything's good. Okay, we're good. Okay, we're good. Let's grow some pot. Right? What was the plot? Gives it to all the sick people and now this poor guys and learned 80 or stretch. Right. It's insane. It comes in and now as a man of science and you clearly are, what, what, how do you feel when you see like CNN and you see like doctor drew talking all this craziness on CNN about withdrawal symptoms and withdrawal syndromes. He was saying from, from cannabis use. And how about the cannabis today is so much stronger than it was where younger. It's incredibly dangerous. These words. Incredibly dangerous. It's like I hear this nonsense and I'm like, this is again a man who can't see describing a kaleidoscope.

Speaker 7:          01:19:43       This is a person who doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about. A guy who's incredibly straight and he's, he's, he's describing something and it's always negative. Ignore every artist, ignore every person who tells you it makes food taste better and makes sex feel, but ignore all of that. Ignore all these people that are quoting all these positive things and focus on what is most likely bullshit. If you, if you go by personal experience like what we all know if someone is having psychotic episodes because of marijuana, I have gotten to think they were going to have psychotic episodes anyway. I got to think marijuana just got them there. They were already fucked. I mean, I would, I would have to assume just knowing my own personal experience with the drug, when someone who hasn't had an experience with the trunk and they're talking about it, it's maddening. It's, it's a crazy person talking. It's like, where are your bodies? Where are these numbers?

Speaker 4:          01:20:39       Oh, these people are, you know, their cultural icons. Who are paid to paid to be very important already. Right. Not just that paid by the pharmaceutical companies, paid by the pharmaceutical companies, the media, everybody else to pull it out a certain meme, a certain message and you know, so you shouldn't be surprised. I mean, I mean that's just, you know, this is drive you crazy though. Like when you see that if you have all the channels, yeah, it does. I mean, it drives me crazy, but I'm so old and cynical and jaded and you know, I mean it, it's like I've done it drives, it doesn't surprise me at all. I mean, I think the only solution is, I'm not sure what the solution is. The solution is to get the right word out to people somehow. And that's what things like your program and other, other channels I feel like I tried to do.

Speaker 4:          01:21:35       And uh, you know, I mean, um, I like to plug Arrow would you probably know about Arrow with wonderful people who are doing a good job of bringing actual facts, you know, to the table. And so we need more resources like that. And they're not pro or anti, they're pro fact, which is what I admire about them as a trip. Reports are very helpful for very helpful and they will say, you know, the dangerous or this the, you know, you'd need to be aware of these possible hazards and, and uh, and that's the only thing, education, the only solution to this is just say no, you know, k n o w that's the thing, you know, and this is, and it's all a matter of education. Some money. Yeah. It banded believe whose quote is that? Just say, I think it's Timothy leary should be online. If someone should have a cafe pressure ready to go, I'm going to get off on amazon.com right after this. And by, you know, the thing is, uh, it's, it's really all about education. It's about empowering people to make informed decisions about what kind of substances that are going to use, under what circumstances, what their intentions are. There's a protocol, there's a way to use these things in a positive way, in a way to use them. Destructively I'm fond of, I mean, I always tell my students

Speaker 1:          01:23:07       there is no such thing as a bad drug or a good drug. They don't have moral qualities. Human beings have moral qualities. There are plenty of opportunities to misuse it, drug or use a drug in a bad way. That's not the drug's fault. It's simply has the pharmacological chemical properties that it has poisoned isn't evil. It's just poison. It's all about how people use it, right? It's human behavior is what we need to focus on. And that's what drug education doesn't focus on it. It talks about the drugs almost as though they were demons are pathogens or like they had some kind of independent existence and they were an evil virus or something. They are not. It's the way people use them. And what, what needs to happen with drug education is, you know, they don't want to admit this, but here's, here's the ball truth of it.

Speaker 1:          01:24:05       It's not about teach telling people do not use drugs, right? I mean they say that's gotta be the message. And that's the only message. True Drug Education has got to tell people how to use drugs. That's the difference. How if you, if you choose to use a psychoactive substance, then here's a way to use it. You know, here's what you do to maximize the benefit of it and minimize the harm. It's simply that's, you know, uh, but drug education doesn't, you can't institutionalize programs that are going to tell people how to use drugs. Isn't that funny though? It's funny. I mean, it's stupid. We, we, we expect people to learn how to drive a car. You know, we encourage, uh, responsible drinking, whatever that is. So in that one instant, you know, we, we say we encourage responsible usage, not that people use it in a responsible way.

Speaker 1:          01:25:06       Well, I think we're big on people figuring out shit for themselves, which is why we send people out into the world essentially with almost no knowledge whatsoever about sex and love. When you're young, you just sort of have to stumble into it at your most vulnerable and confused time. Same, same issues. Apply to sex, right? Sex Education and drug education. Our jokes. I think they're currently practice that that's a joke. And what is also a joke is just the, the raising of human beings. I think so many people in this country are being raised by people who are essentially children their entire life. They never really did develop a true understanding of themselves or of their place in the world or an objective sense of this whole thing. And then the great mystery of it all, it's never conveyed. And then they raise children. The children have to somewhere, another wake up and go, okay, nobody knows what the fuck is really going on here.

Speaker 1:          01:26:01       This is we, we live in a world of madness and momentum and it just continues on the same path. Even though everyone knows it's crazy. But can you imagine? I mean, how many people can step out of that framework? You know, it's rare. I mean, if here, you know, if you grow up, if you're, if you're relay raised in a religious household, you know, especially a fundamentalist household, you're not encouraged to think about very much discouraged, heavily discouraged. You're encouraged to, this is what you need to believe. And all this other stuff is, you know, heresy and you, you, you know, you're condemned if, if you think about that. So I really, I mean, well, I don't know. I mean, we could get off for another 40 minutes on antireligious Rachel's to say it, just do it. Don't say it. Right. It's the, it's ideologies.

Speaker 1:          01:26:56       Any ideologies is that the issue is when someone is thinking about what they should do and it's already written for them to subscribe to this, well, everybody's situation is different. Everybody's life is different, your wants and needs are different. And instead of all these different ideas of what we're supposed to do and not supposed to do, and what is evil and what is good, we've lost the ability to figure out what kind of an impact what we're doing has on other people. And judging that first and foremost. And that I think is a very, very much a religious and a psychedelic principle that I, that idea the idea of looking at everything and how it's affecting the other people around you first. And if you did that, no one would ever impose that kind of restrictions on your children. Because if you were truly looking at the development of the children, the first thing you'd say is, well, I don't want to fuck this kid up.

Speaker 1:          01:27:46       Right. You know, instead of suppressing this kid and having this unbelievable resistance, which every God damn human being has ever had ever, when you tell someone not to do something, they want to do it. When you try to control them, they want to break free. When you're a controlling person, they want to pierce their nose and go fucking crazy. Right? It's, it's, it's the same all throughout humanity. So we should have, we should be able to figure that out by now. Well, some have and some do. But do you know, I mean for you to be able to say that, to have that perception, a million had to have it before you. Well, and you had how you have to be an exceptionally in the lighten minded person, you know, if you're, or comedian or, or someone. Yeah, exactly. Who Pushes the envelope, right? Who Really, who makes a profession of out of stepping out of the box or trying to look at things from, you know, a broader perspective. But if you're a person who, you know, I mean, if you were raised in a strict religious household, chances are your children are going to be raised in that household and you never really look, you know, you never take the blinders off because you know, there's all sorts of bad stuff out there and you, you just don't want to know about it. You know, and, and that's the problem. Uh,

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       you know, of the ideologies, the, the problem is that predetermined patterns of thinking. Yeah. I'm in one of the things I like to say a, I think that psychedelics are extremely valuable with respect to, you know, sometimes I talk about faith. One of the things that's interesting about psychedelics is they don't require faith, right? I mean, religious belief, religious tenants are usually postulated on this idea that here's a whole bunch of things that you should believe. And there's not a shred of evidence for any of this, but you must have faith. My son, right? That this is why, why should you have faith? You know, chances are it's a lie. Yeah. I mean, you know, we know that the religions have been scamming this for centuries ontology. Oh Wow. They're legit. Sure. They're legit trying to join Scientology's when he knows I see worth of my land.

Speaker 4:          01:30:00       But the thing is with psychedelics, faith is an impediment. You don't have to have faith. We can just have what you need to have is courage. But what do you say to the people, the cynics, the, you know, the people who would look at the psychedelic experiences and say, okay, you are glorifying and, and you're over exaggerating what's essentially a hallucination. Your visual cortex has being bombarded with these foreign chemicals. You're seeing things that aren't there. And all this is, is just your, your brains need to make something profound out of what's essentially a malfunction, a malfunction of your, you're, you're thinking a malfunction of your visuals and you've sort of attached to all this importance to it after the experiences over. Well, that's the cynical point of view. That's the cynical point of view. But to that, I would reply that you know what we call ordinary reality, ordinary consciousness, even consensus.

Speaker 4:          01:30:58       Reality is essentially a hallucination. I mean, right? The reason drugs work is because we're made of drugs. You know, and whether or not we're on drugs or not, our brains are creating, you know, this reality which, which we know does not resemble the real world. Whatever that is. I mean the instruments of our physics and so on tell us that the world is a quantum world is full of vibration. That it doesn't look anything like this, that Adams, we mostly hard. A lot of what our brain does is synthesize a hallucination, essentially create a model of the world that we proceed to live in. You know, I mean the world that we, you and I share and everyone shared, this is a model of the world. This is a model reality, not the real reality. The real reality is completely unknowable and will always remain so.

Speaker 4:          01:31:53       So for people to say, well, you've just, yeah, you've disturbed your brain chemistry in a novel way. If you've tuned into different channel essentially, but you're still working with a model, whether it's a model of the world experience through the lens of a drug or whether it's experienced through the lens of, you know, sober conscious perception. It's still a biochemical artifact in a sense. Our brains create this, we live inside of it, you know, and uh, that's so, so that's what I would say to those people that it's not that, you know, there is some kind of objective reality which we're immersed in when we're not on drugs. It's more that were on drugs all the time. You know, our brain is a organ that happens to churn out drugs, you know, which we called neurotransmitters and hormones and that's what our brains run on. So all, all you do when you take an external drug is you tweak one or more of those sets of receptors that, that there were Unser talking to and you know, you get a slightly distorted signal from what we, what we have come to accept as ordinary reality. There is no ordinary reality or we don't know what it is. It's, it's forever unknowable in terms of our subjective experience.

Speaker 7:          01:33:24       There's a very strong makes sense. Yes it does. There's a very strange desire to discount something that, uh, you can't like put on a scale. He can't like can't bring it back and show it to someone. But essentially most of what you experience in your everyday life is just that. It's just an experience. You're seeing things, you're feeling things and you're traveling, you're taking in information. But we have this real need a lot of people to, to discount the things that happened to discount the, the vision of the psychedelic experience, the hallucinations, the, the visuals, the, the, the profound impact and the sounds. Even though those are experiences that you are taking in as an individual, as a human being, as an entity, you're taking those in there. They're dismissed. They're discounted because the, you know, you can't, you can't hit them. You can't, you can't paint them. You can't, you know, there, there's nothing there. You have nothing there. You can't that experience, although significant to you.

Speaker 4:          01:34:22       Well, yeah, but, but now, I mean, that's part of the task I think is to be able to bring something back from that place. And people do. I mean, I think that's a lot of what psychedelic art does and these sort of creative interfaces. It's not that people go out and take psychedelic drugs. I've never produce anything. You know, those experiences influenced them profoundly and you may not be able to exactly reproduce them. But given the technologies that we have access to, you can come pretty darn close, you know, with multimedia technologies and computer graphics and all this stuff. And it may be that, you know, well, I mean I, I think this technology is only going to get better as we evolve, you know, toward it maybe a 10 or 15 years. He won't have to take psychedelic drugs because we'll have neurotechnologies that just do the same thing, you know, or you maybe it is that you, you know, you take one psychedelic drug, you take a capsule and it's a nano machine that will on demand produce any kind of altered state that you want to call up.

Speaker 7:          01:35:38       One of the more faster but also within the realm of possibility. That's the scary part is that it's not just science fiction. And one of my fascinating concepts, et Cetera, Terence had was the, uh, the, the concept of the singularity is he saw it, you know, the, the technological singularity it a little bit different than the Kurtzweil and a lot of these futurists saw it. He thought it was a very likely going to be a time machine or something along those lines. Something that will, they'll be created where there's a new technology we're time ceases to be linear. What did you, did you wrap your head around that? Like how did you feel about that one?

Speaker 4:          01:36:14       Well, yeah, we did that mean we'd love to, to play with that idea and uh, you know, in fact we used to, you know, Terry used to speculate that the 2012 that the singularity will be triggered the moment that time travel is invented and everyone and everyone after that, we'll of course want a migrate back to the original moment when time travel was invented. So suddenly there'll be all these time machines condensing out of nowhere and basically it's to do everything changes. Right, right.

Speaker 7:          01:36:51       James only can either wrap their head around that idea that infinite time and distance into the future would all be able to access the moment the first time machine was invented. That's true. All come back

Speaker 4:          01:37:02       time. Travel would certainly change everything if you could do that. I don't know. I mean physics pretty much tells us that time travel is technically possible, but only if you have access to manipulation of energies that are likely, there'll be way beyond us for quite awhile. You know, black, whole levels of energy and that kind of thing to do things with time. But there's always a possibility that there will be a breakthrough. Right. You know, you never know.

Speaker 7:          01:37:37       Well we're gonna, we're never going to stop. My thought about human ingenuity and the r constant desire for innovation is that I don't ever see it stopping. It seems to be a part of what the human animal is and what it does here. So when, if someone like, um, I do not remember his name, the guy out of a university of Connecticut who was the, he's the lead time travel, uh, expert. It's a really fascinating character. He's like a guy in the Spiderman book because his father died when he was a young boy. So he became determined to build a time machine to go back and save his father. Oh yeah. Really fascinating guy. I cannot remember his name. Uh, I will eventually. Um, but his, um, his Ronald Mallet, his, uh, his idea, I think a, was that once he had really thoroughly research time travel, he realized that you would never be able to go back before the moment of time.

Speaker 7:          01:38:34       Machine was invented that there's, you're never going to be able to go backwards, but you can go back to that moment. Yeah. Well that's, Terence had that idea long before this guy did and this guy was like, you know, he's a legit peer reviewed scientists. I mean, he's had like, he has a peer reviewed paper on the, the science behind time travel and they all agree that yeah, if you could generate this insane amount of power, you could be able to do it. You could do it. I find it amazing that Terrence had this idea as well, like really long before it was like sort of a mainstream thought.

Speaker 1:          01:39:06       Well, you know, you can attribute that to in a sense what we were immersed in when we were kids. I mean we were both completely sucked into science fiction. We were very much immersed in science fiction, hg wells novel the time, just like, you know, at the time machine. I mean, that was a huge influence on me. I probably read that sucker Tanner time. I read that when I was a kid as well. I was a whole lay fascinated by by that I all the versions of the movie as well. Well, so at least two versions. So at least two versions. Yeah, it versions. I think the first one was possibly a little better, but yeah, so those ideas, you know, we're, we're out there and, uh, and again, in other psychedelics and shamonic states, you couldn't type travel, you know, have you read a Graham Hancock's do novel? No. Very interesting. Tangled. Oh, you should read it. I would love to. Very interesting. I've read his nonfiction stuff and uh, this is his first novel, but it's all about a, essentially a time bridge between a shamonic person 17,000 years ago and a modern counterpart and they're communicating across there and tangle literally quantum entangled. And it's, it's quite a fascinating novel. He had fun with it. I find it amazing that we've able, we've been able to, for the most part, not destroy ourselves

Speaker 7:          01:40:39       with nuclear power because nuclear power and a lot of the ways, the big impact, the biggest impact that has not just powering cities, but destroying them and on the fact that we've sort of figured out a way to put a cap on that. And really, even despite all the conflict in world, we haven't had a nuclear event like that since the 1940s right. I wonder how much more evolved we would have to be to be responsible for the actual use of a time machine. I mean, how much more evolved would we have to be before we could have something like that? It wouldn't be the president has access to the button. It would be, you know, the president has access to the hole in the universe. You know? I mean, what, how do we decide whether or not we're going to do this? How do we decide who we go back in time and save? You know, when events happen in the news, do we have like a congressional meeting? Do we go back in time and a well person?

Speaker 1:          01:41:28       I mean, I think that's a, that's a misunderstanding of the nature of time, right? I mean, if, I mean one of the reasons time travel is impossible, supposedly that kind of time is because you can't do those things. You can't go back and prefab the Kennedy assassination, you know, because you proliferate another timeline and things to at least one more. But then, you know, physicists tell us, I'm the current theory is everything you do pre precipitates, you know, proliferates multiple timelines. It's please explain that because Duncan and I have been trying to wrap our heads around that one and we've, we've brought it up to each other a couple of times. The, I, it's sort of a, an abstract idea in my head, but every decision you make literally brings up, uh, creates a different universe, creates a different universe and not only every decision you ever make. If I understand it, it extends to, you know, every collapse of a, of a wave form every, you know, collision of Adam's, every event, every offense, no matter how minuscule or insignificant that we're not even aware of proliferates multiple, multiple time frames. It doesn't make sense. Obviously we can't wrap our head around this. And it may be that we're, you know, I've been, maybe we're not, maybe we're not confined to one of these timelines where it maybe we're living simultaneously infinite number of timelines. That's so hard. Yeah. It's hard to wrap your head.

Speaker 7:          01:43:06       The idea of fractal universe is an infinite amount of faculty, universities and they're constantly changing and moving like, like a, a, a tide filled with cells, like a tide of cells just washing over the world over and over, back and forth. It never ends, but why not? What, why, why reality? Why this, this is a bizarre enough as it is. Exactly. I've always said to be, be like, if you don't, if you, you know, you don't want to have a psychedelic experience, you are, whether you like it or not, it's called life. Because if you existed in some sort of a logical continuum of real objective thought and reasoning, and you had to exist in, in life, in today and the human world in 2012 and that was my point. That's what we were saying earlier. The brain is a machine that simulates the reality that we live in. You know, and

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       then, you know, so, so it, it just is, I mean, it's our, it, it takes the raw data of experience and it mixes it together in the way that, and it extrudes it into something comprehensible. So the brain is as much a processor of this data from outside visit. I mean, I don't, I think the question of whether the braid generates consciousness is one of the con, you know, one of the things that neuroscience has to confront, and I think the evidence is that it doesn't, it's more a real detector of consciousness. This what evidence, what evidence is this? That the, the brain detect consequences? Well, it's not all of the evidence of non ordinary states. You know, these other dimensions that for shamanism and for psychedelics, they present as real. I mean, does the brain dream all those up? Why is the, why are there commonalities between those states?

Speaker 1:          01:44:53       Uh, you know, between people. I mean, you don't have to be fans of Terence and Dennis Mckenna to take DMT, have to have similar experiences, you know, to us. So I think, I just don't think that we really have a definitive way to say that all of what we experience arises from the brain. It's more that consciousness is built into the structure of space time in a certain way. And our brains are detectors and processors much in the way of television is a detector of a signal, takes it, the signal processes it in a way that's comprehensible and puts it out there,

Speaker 7:          01:45:40       the screen. So the, the ego and the personality and the lifestyle you choose and what have you as you're making your way through this, this dimension is essentially just clothing that you wear in a shield, you from the great outdoors of reality essentially.

Speaker 1:          01:45:54       Yeah. It's a model that you create. It's a model that you create and it helps you get through. This, helps you get through it and it maps closely enough, close enough to some external reality out there that you can navigate. You're not stepping off cliff cliffs or you know, walking in front of buses. So it has a definite survival value and there's enough overlap between what you're consensual world is and mine is and ours is that we can talk to each other, we can live in this same space. It out to a certain extent.

Speaker 7:          01:46:33       Fascinating concept and it, it really is and that's one of the more profound aspects of the psychedelic experiences. The stripping away of that personality and culture and and and everything and getting to some weird strange source getting to this strange that exists

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       is this clear thought without our a minute you get to turn the circuit board over, right? You begin to turn, you get to turn it over and see how it's wired. I think that's one of the

Speaker 8:          01:47:02       big

Speaker 4:          01:47:04       useful, interesting things about psychedelics and particularly DMT. DMT just rips the curtain back and you'd get to see the raw data of experience and how it's all, it's everything. Everything you know, memories, people you talked to, fragments of you know, songs, just whatever things are swimming around in your head. You sort of see they're all going into, you know, through this funnel or something. Then it's coming out all a taped together some way and that kind of a coherent picture of, of reality. But DMT strips that back and you get to step, you get to see it from the other side briefly, how it's, how it's working, you know, the reality generating machine if you will. That's what you see on DMT. What is your thoughts or what are your thoughts on, uh, alien abductions and Ufo experiences? And do you think that these are indogenous dumps of, uh, Dante, that it's most likely what these people were experiencing is some sort of a, um, well overflow or something, you know, a, no, I don't, I mean, I think that, you know, I think that Strassman's work on this where high doses of DMT can

Speaker 8:          01:48:27       in, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:48:29       in some people reliably induce these, these abduction type in categories. We'll, we'd, no, they're not, you know, standing beside a highway in New Mexico and watching it Ufo land. They're in a hospital bed, you know, with an ivy installed, but they're having these types of experiences. For those who don't know what you're talking about, it's Rick Strassman's work. It's a book called DMT, the spirit molecule. It's all about the clinical studies, right? Things you did with TMT, clinical studies with DMT at Straussman reported that in many of his subjects who are given high doses of DMT, they had experiences that were similar, if not identical to the classic alien abduction type experience. So then you do think that that's what these people are having, they're having indogenous dumps while they're sleeping. It's just something's happening and that's, no, I think that not necessarily. I think that, I think that there, I think that what DMT does is it lets you poke your head temporarily into another dimension.

Speaker 4:          01:49:32       So when these people are having these UFO abduction experiences, you think that other dimension is poking his head into ours and yeah, something like that. So somehow the membrane is Theon and you know, whether it's you going there, them going here, there is, you know, there, there are interfaces between what we call ordinary reality, which isn't ordinary at all. And these other thesis alternate realities. And occasionally they come together, you know, and the membranes stretches and then you get these types of interactions. If that's true. I mean if that's true, uh, that, you know, that model is, you know, the usual model of, of experiences reductionist. It's like the braveness generating all of this and that's where it's coming from. And uh, you know, everything we think we know about the world is based on that premise. If this other premise is true, then we have to reexamine our most fundamental assumptions about how it is, you know, how the world is

Speaker 7:          01:50:43       the um, the issue isn't the, isn't part of it though, that all these abductions parents is a good percentage of them happen at night.

Speaker 7:          01:50:51       They happen a lot of them. All of these people aren't bad. They're not happening while people are like, um, Monday morning on the highway, right to work, happening while you're supposed to be sleeping, while your brain is producing DMT in the first place. Exact. Do you think that the DMT could possibly, I mean this is complete speculation, but act as a doorway where the actual real, true entity can come through. So these people that are having these UFO abduction experiences, even if they are still lying in their bed, they are actually still having this real experience.

Speaker 4:          01:51:21       Yeah, I do. I mean, and if you talk to Sherman's people that deliberately induce these states for exactly this reason, to communicate with these nonhuman intelligences that give them useful information about all kinds of things. I mean, the Shamans are just matter of fact about it and they'll just say, well, yeah, that, what did you think it was? You know, this is the way reality is then that that's where the cynics, so he's coming like, where, where's this information? What are you bringing back? Can someone please bring back and unsolvable equation that fast? Maddix that's a tough one. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think like that?

Speaker 7:          01:52:00       If you had a point to anything that's been brought back from the Psychedelic, you expect, uh, you know, uh, not the, the Francis Crick thing that's disputed. Right? Whether or not Francis Crick, you actually saw the double helix while he was on Lsd.

Speaker 4:          01:52:14       Well, he said that he did finally death bed on his death bed. There's no recording. You know what I mean? How much of that is just very Moelis pcrs totally out front about his LSD experiences contributed to his insights about this ear. Right. It's difficult to measure bringing something back. I mean, and Terrence was, you know, he, he, he has talked about this. He used to what he was taking mushrooms do exactly this, get I thou

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       dialogue going with the mushroom and you know, insist that the mushroom tell him something that he couldn't possibly know. You know, and the mushroom was always very cagey about, didn't cough it up. But when you think, well if I tell you that you won't need, that sounds like the imagination to me. I mean if I was the cynic I would say, well that's obviously your imagination then cause he can't concoct to anything and it doesn't exist or something you couldn't possibly know. It doesn't have the resources because it's coming from your own mind. Well that would be, that would be the criticism. But then out of that comes something like this, the TimeWave zero. I mean, I would submit the time where zero was an artifact from this other dimension, but do we really understand what it was? I mean it was a conceptual

Speaker 1:          01:53:37       artifact in a certain sense. It was an idea. So even certainly came from left field, you know, regardless of whether or not it actually is some sort of a map of time. It most certainly is a 13 lunar cycle calendar. Well it certainly is. That came from a psychedelic experience that the knowledge of that essentially. Yeah, essentially. So that's, that seems to be something that you can at least that aspect of it. It seems very unfortunate that it's connected with this idea of a map of time, which makes people stick their nose up in the air because if they just looked at it for that, just the, the each thing being a, um, a calendar and an, an a last calendar and unleavened calendar. Indisputably it's a calendar or you can use it that way. I mean, the mathematics is clear as long as you don't begin to postulate that this actually, you know, describes the structure of time. That's where I have a problem with it because for one thing, you know, TimeWave zero completely ignores relativity and all the aspects of time that go into that. So you know how cell, well, it claims that, you know, uh, if claims that this

Speaker 1:          01:54:47       map of time describes the structure of time everywhere, you know, in all parts of the universe, but we know from relativity that it all depends on the reference frame. Right. So, you know, so it's not clear ship traveling speed of light, someone aboard it experiences time at a different level and it's given on earth different way. How do you con side that, how did, how did the, how do they call it? Can't reconcile. It just doesn't account for it, you know? I mean, the problem with the TimeWave to stay up for this conversation that the, I'm trying to wrap my head around it while, while we're talking about the TimeWave in my, in my opinion, is that it's not, it can't be disproved. Neither can Jesus. And so, right. Science can't disprove anything. Science can't disapprove. Well, yeah, science can disapprove things. They can't prove it. Not unique events. Right? That unique events happened. The other words, in other words, Terence or whoever created the TimeWave theory never defined, these are the criteria that will invalidate this theory, right? And science depends on, in order to qualify as a theory, you have to say what's going to invalidate it? What is, you know, what are the criteria that's going to

Speaker 1:          01:56:08       take the foundations out from under this theory? That either means you have to chuck the theory completely or you have to modify it. So the model fits the data better. Right? And, uh, he was never able to, or he'd never did. And I don't think he was really able to define what would invalidate the theory. So it's an untestable theory. So it's not a theory. So it's just an idea. It's an interesting idea, but it isn't the theory. It's not something you can disapprove. And so it's,

Speaker 1:          01:56:44       it's useful as an idea, but it's, but in some ways it's not. I mean, you know, you've got, if you want it to be scientific, if you want to call this a theory in the scientific sense, you have to define what's gonna, what's gonna disapprove it, what I meant, the science can't disprove things when I met as, I can't disprove like really unique events, like the idea of a Ufo actually existing and then disappearing like once it's here in God. If there's no physical evidence, if there's not, I mean, how do you, how can you disprove a unique event like that? But when you, well, yeah, you, you don't, you don't, I mean that the doesn't mean they don't exist though. Right. They do exist. Sure. Something makes is, I mean, I always thought that what Jl Heineke, the UFO researcher, famous Ufo researcher said about Ufo as he said, I don't know if you have photos are real or not, but I know absolutely 100% that Ufo experiences are real.

Speaker 1:          01:57:44       Hmm. And that's the data. That's the data that you have to investigate. I think that, I think that's a very perceptive thing to say. Especially coming from him. Yeah. He's coming from Jay on. Nick was a guy who actually worked for operation. We're project Blue Book and uh, he was, uh, assigned by the government to go and research different UFO sightings. And somewhere along the line he cited, listen man, I'm going to just do this. And he stopped working for the government. It just started spending all of his time researching Ufo. He was absolutely convinced. He was always clear that what he was investigated where Ufo experiences because that was the data that he had to work with, you know, and that's absolutely 100% true. Ufo experiences do occur, whether those are confabulation of, you know, the mind or whether they're, you know, whether they're extra terrestrial origin, extra dimensional. Laura, I don't think we can really say,

Speaker 7:          01:58:45       did you ever have any sort of alien experience? Did you ever have any sort of extra terrestrial physical contact?

Speaker 1:          01:58:54       Um, no, I can't say I have, you know, um, other than being smeared over the entire universe. Yeah. But that was, that was, that was, that was saying it was extra terrestrial but, but Terrence did you know at lunch Herrera, he did. Of course there was no one else to witness this. Right. And I write about that in the book. I actually quote at length the section from a true hallucinations in which he describes this. And I have no doubt, I don't doubt that it took place. I mean, there was all sorts of anomalous things taking place a lot. Sure.

Speaker 7:          01:59:34       And then again, it goes back to the fact that you guys were ingesting the most incredible silicide mushrooms every day. All Day.

Speaker 1:          01:59:42       I mean, but, but the really interesting stuff didn't start until after we've stopped that.

Speaker 7:          01:59:50       Well, even after he stopped that though, how much of that shit was still floating around in your head? I mean, you guys were talking about crazy quantities. Are you to say, did you ever sober up? I still high from that. Substances are still high from it because that experience, you'd never,

Speaker 1:          02:00:05       you know, you're always integrating it. I mean, it's rather strange to me that, you know, it's like that was 1971 so that was 40 years ago.

Speaker 7:          02:00:17       And one of the more interesting things that Terence said about, uh, siliciden, which was a real mind blower was first of all, how closely it relates to normal human neurochemistry is that silicide been, is like almost exactly the same as chemicals that are on brain produces and very alien in that form, that form the form that it exists. Whatever the molecule structure of suicide of it is, it's the only similar, the way it exists it, there's not something similar to it or there's not something like it that exists in the organic world other than a

Speaker 1:          02:00:55       chemistry. Yeah. Well that's not quite true, but I think what he was trying to say that it's silicide button is, is only found in the fungal kingdom. Right. As far as we know, it's never been found in a higher plan. Although lots of tryptamines DMT is all over the place and a lot of mess derivatives. But psilocybin and Silversun do not occur as far as we know outside the fungal world, outside the world of mushrooms. Why that should be hard to say. Maybe it will be discovered in a higher plant tomorrow or next week, but I kind of doubt it. Uh, you know, uh, I don't want to get too much into the chemistry, but I do think, I think that, you know, this, this touches on another, you know, remarkable aspect of, of our universe, of, of uh, biological being, which is that these tryptamines DMT five methoxy DMT, Bufo, silicide and Silversun DMT itself as two steps from Tryptofan, right?

Speaker 1:          02:02:03       Tryptophan is an amino acid that is universal. It's part of the 20 that go into proteins. So it's an essential molecule of life. Tryptofan is the molecule are the enzymes that convert Tryptofan to DMT. There are two primary enzymes, a amino acid decarboxylase aromatic amino acid, decarboxylase and methyltransferases, what they're call called. I don't know if your audience cares about this, but the point is too trivial steps from tryptofan leads to DMT, right? And so DMT, you know, the, the, the biosphere is saturated with DMT. It's not an uncommon chemical at all. It's found in probably thousands of plants. It's found in animals that's filed in fungi. It's everywhere. I think it's interesting. I don't know what it means except you know, stepping away from science for a minute, strict science, but thinking maybe this is a kind of a subtle message that nature is trying to send to the monkeys.

Speaker 7:          02:03:16       So that's why DMTs everywhere. Yeah. Look guys, just look around the corner, right? It's all waiting for you. It's all there. If I remember one time I said was what he found fast. It was a, what he was alluding to was that silicide and may have come here and uh, from an asteroid that it could survive in a vacuum. And He, I think it was, um, the phosphorous, I believe in the four position describing the, the molecular structure of suicide, suicide and its phosphorolated form position. As you said, it was the only thing that was like that. Is that right?

Speaker 1:          02:03:50       It's the only one we found so far. It's the only phosphorylated in Dole that we found in nature. Well that and some close derivatives which also occur in them. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:04:01       Does that make any sense then that that could have possibly come here? We know that what it's called Pennsbury as a, how they just have the sperm Mia Panspermia is how the, they believe that amino acids and essential building blocks from life may have traveled here from asteroids. And that may be how life was seated on this planet or

Speaker 1:          02:04:16       I mean I suggest in the book actually people have to read the book because they have to kind of unpack this. I actually have a section in the book called reflections on Lunch Herrera. And I, uh, trying to, not only I'm it for the reader, but try and look at it myself from the standpoint of 40 years

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       Hanse, you know, after the experience and say what was going on and what makes sense. And what might've been going on was, was it simply to, you know, nerdy guys who went to the Amazon, took too many drugs and m had these experiences and that end of story or was there really something else going on? And the whole issue touches on what we were talking about, about the evolutionary potential evolutionary significance of mushrooms. I mean it may be that what we are is a million year, multimillion year long biotechnologies a essentially where, you know, if a super technological civilization biotechnological civilization with plenty of time on its hands in a certain perspective, if they wanted to take an ecology and see what happened when they see did these molecules into the ecology, you know, and then watched it unfold. Do you know, perhaps manipulating the way things unfolded. They, it's almost like, you know, they wanted to,

Speaker 9:          02:05:56       okay,

Speaker 4:          02:05:57       kind of I guess create the conditions where intelligence and consciousness could arise and then see what the effects were in a certain sample media style pro Mithias style. Although prometheus's we all agree was

Speaker 1:          02:06:12       pretty lame. But something like that you said at first something, something along that,

Speaker 4:          02:06:18       those lines. So you know where if you seed the ecology with Tryptofan and the enzymes, then this, this thing is going to be all over the place. And then, you know, I'm probably predate the appearance of complex nervous systems. But you know, we know for example, that the serotonin receptors are evolutionarily the oldest receptors that we'd known the oldest neurotransmitter receptors. So,

Speaker 1:          02:06:54       uh, well, I don't know, I mean it's tempting to speculate on this. It's very sexy to, it's sexy. It's comforting in a certain way to think there is actually an overlord that south their CD and intelligence throughout the galaxy. I mean, what a cool idea. But you yourself knowing so much about biology, looking at the complex processes that occur on this planet that are completely, I wouldn't say they're orchestrated by nature, but like this, the parasitic relationships, they're really complex ones that eh, parasites have with like the aquatic water. A worm that gets inside of a grasshopper grows then convinces the grasshopper to commit suicide so it can be born into the water. I mean, we know about these weird crazy relationships that exist. Right? Exactly. So, well, but this is a kind of an example of that, right? On the galactic scale. Exactly. You know, if, if there are fungi in nature and actually your cordyceps in years supplement is exactly that.

Speaker 1:          02:07:57       You know, it's biology, you know, it grows on caterpillars. There are, there are some species that will grow on ants and you probably heard how they work. They will infect the APP at a certain point, the Haas Storia, they will put these mycelium, mycelium will affect the amps sprain and trigger it to go from the base of the leaf of the blade of grass to the tip. Then it will kill it and parallel. Oh right. And then, and then it can sporulate right. It will overgrow the body and released the spores, but it's induced the hand to go from the least optimal place to distribute spores to the most optimal, credible. So it's controlled. So that, that's a phenomenon that's an intelligent nature. Yeah. So kind of intense spreading intelligence. So why is it so far fetched to think that there is a galactic, you know, uh, super race or maybe it's, you know, that infects, you know, complex nervous systems when they be busy in our ecology that that then induces us to, you know, invent culture and language and technology and eventually build star ships and get off this bud and do what they're doing and do what they're continuing the, the most advanced form of uh, like forming life and other places.

Speaker 1:          02:09:25       Yeah. Maybe or might maybe just also just could be that. So I mean this is getting so far out. We should probably add the,

Speaker 10:         02:09:34       we went as far down the what if ladder galactic overlord sending spaceships filled with mushrooms. Yeah, that's, that's like next top crazy. I remember

Speaker 1:          02:09:45       what I mean. This seems to remember that we exist. You have to remember that we're putting a rover on Mars and taking photographs and possibly contaminating how unlikely this whole thing is that we should even be here. I mean one of Terrence's favorite phrases and I think it's true. We should always remember what JBS health aide said. You know, the universe is not only stranger than you suppose it's stranger than you can suppose. I love that quote. And I love that he used to say queer because that's what [inaudible] said it was going to say, actually he said Queer, but we can't use that term. Isn't that funny? That they took queer, they took queer. That's what the universe is a queer thing. It doesn't kind of exist in that way as well. They know anything that has hatches to homosexual men can't have a gay old time anymore. Place it with a white university. Just a stranger. They say stranger. No, like you can't say you have a gay old time. The Flinstones had gay old time in their fucking song. You can't have that anymore. We are so sensitive for such a little babies. Yeah. Yeah. In the middle of all this information, we've tried to chalkboards away. We're trying to take him, take him away. So, you know, I think, I think that, uh,

Speaker 4:          02:10:57       yeah, I think that ultimately, you know, people say, well, what can we conclude from all this and what have you learned from taking psychedelics, you know, for 40 years and all that. And the answer is kind of disappointing. It will be disappointing to some people, which is the, exactly this, the world is a marvelous place, much more marvelous than we can imagine. You know, and we don't know very much, you know, I mean, there are, knowledge is so restricted, you know? Um,

Speaker 9:          02:11:33       okay.

Speaker 4:          02:11:33       And I think that's, that's what you learn after all this time. And this is what I owe Osca you know, my main plant teacher always insists, you know, remember, you don't know

Speaker 1:          02:11:44       shit. You know, don't give up. Don't give up

Speaker 4:          02:11:48       arrogant because you don't know shit. You know, you just don't know very much. And so it's like, you can say, well, I don't know shit and I feel really stupid. But it also clears the decks to appreciate things and remind ourselves that we don't know very much. But if clears the decks for learning, it means there's so much left to be understood that marveled about and thought about

Speaker 1:          02:12:16       ga excepted position. Yeah, except the position that you don't know shit and then enjoy all the information there is to take in and all the fascination and the wonder. Yeah. She was like, people are trying to control the position and they're trying to control it and pretend that they do no shit and that's the big mistake. That's where the knee jerk reaction to a denying global climate change comes from. It's a just a desire of insecure people to try to rationalize and control things that can't be controlled and the politicians want to do religion, politics, corporations, the whole thing. Like we have a model we don't want to change. We have a corner on the truth. The way we think about it is the way it is, you know, and anybody who challenged us that is a is a heretic. Now, how long did it take you after lecturer before you jump back on the horse? It seems like if I got smeared across the entire cosmos for a couple of weeks and I don't remember how I shit or smoke cigarettes, I might just fucking quit. Okay. But not you. How much time did you take off before you jumped back on? Well, I don't know if some people never have jumped back on, but, but how much time did it take after psychedelic put the can

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       of tuna fish and do like normal thing? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, how long before you had another psychedelic experience? Oh, another site. Well, it was probably a couple of years. I don't know. It makes sense. It wasn't that long. It wasn't really that long. That's a long time. Yeah. Did you like before you did it and be like, what the fuck am I doing? Am I really want to get spread across the university? Well, yeah. I mean I have, I have some, some worries about it when I went back to it, but, but not really because there were so many other circumstances. The psychedelic was just a part of it. A lot of it. The reason that's happened was because we set ourselves up into this, you know, conceptual or I don't know what you call a it cognitive box.

Speaker 4:          02:14:24       We set ourselves, we painted ourselves into this corner in terms of our predictions about what was going to happen, you know, because it was all about time, right? A lot of it was about time and so when we were leading up to doing the experiment, we thought that, well, the reason all this strange stuff is happening is because a few hours up ahead in the future, we've done the experiment and it is succeeded. And so what we're getting is the backwash from the future, like approaching a singularity, you know, we were getting the backwash from the future and that's why every it's warping reality. It literally is warping reality as we approach this thing. So we went into it with the attitude that something had to happen, something physic shattering. I'm the, we were trying to overturn, literally the laws of physics came into it with the idea that something had to happen and guess what, something happened just wasn't what we predicted would happen.

Speaker 4:          02:15:30       He just went cuckoo for a couple of weeks. Cocoa for a couple of weeks. Yeah, exactly. And we, but it was more than just cuckoo. It was this, you know, this, this coordinated, uh, experience of Terrence and myself were, we were linked and we understood that one person is becoming mirror images of each other, almost like a photograph and it's negative and one, one entity was going forward in time. And then another was going backward in time. And you know, a lot of, I mean, we had a whole framework where it made sense. It might not make sense now. Yeah. Well it doesn't, it doesn't, I mean it does, but I'm lying. I does, but I mean, I, I, it does have, but not that I'm lying. I mean, I'm sorry. I do understand that you're trying to express something that I can't understand. Right. Did you have a lot of experiences or experiences where

Speaker 7:          02:16:30       you saw ancient motifs? And May, whether its hieroglyphs or Egyptian or I've heard people that say they've seen aromatic or Arab type writing and w with seems to be maybe perhaps the experiences of other people that have taken the same sort of psychedelic drugs and that it's a stored, collected experience. I thought, I know that was one of the things that Terrence believed that when you are taking psilocybin you're not just taking silicide when you're sort of conjoining the experiences of everybody who's ever taken that drug ever. Did you feel that

Speaker 1:          02:17:05       you mean that La Chorrera uh, at any point? Oh yeah. Yeah. Subsequently I have had, I have had those kinds of impressions. Yeah. I mean there, I mean I think it's interesting that,

Speaker 1:          02:17:20       you know, one of the things that when, when we, when we came back from La Chorrera one of the priorities that our life was to figure out how to grow those mushrooms. Right. So that we can reaccess. Right. But I mean then there was partly, you know, there was partly a mercenary motive, but there was also the, the real motive was we want other people to have these experiences. To see if they confirm, you know, what we were experienced. I mean, where we just nuts or do other people have this similar kind of experience at turns out they do. You know, so that's evidence I can for the objective reality of some of these dimensions or the reality. I don't know if it's objective, but you know what I'm saying? You don't have to be Terence or Dennis. You don't have to know what we talk about or believe in what we talk about.

Speaker 1:          02:18:16       You can take mushrooms under the right circumstances, you know, in the dark five grams, pay attention and you will go to the same place. Many people go to the same place. Do you think that that also explains why the in the Iowasca experience is a, a lot of jaguars and a lot of snakes and a lot of, uh, that, that type of cause to them, that's the dimension. That's the dimension that's real for those people. And it's just, you know, it, I mean, if it is to us it seems implausible and unlikely, but to them it's like it's a part of their everyday reality. They just accept it. I mean it's much more matter of fact, yes, there are these realms, there are these entities you can get there with Iowa Osca and uh,

Speaker 1:          02:19:12       you know, if you look at, if you look at the paintings of Pablo, Emma Ringo for example, or others, you know, I mean he had this ability to paint that realm as best direct elected, but that's a tremendous contribution because he provided a window into that cosmology. You could sort of look into that conceptual place without actually taking Iowasca as Alex Grey as does Alex grey a similar kind of thing. Yeah. All of in Pablos iconography, all of these spirits that you see and you FO's incidentally and plants and animals and all that, they all have names. These are not things that he dreamed up. These are part of that cosmos that he is able to depict. What is his name again? Pablo Amarigo and may our Ryan, I've got to check him out. I've never heard of this guy before. No. I believe I've seen his art, but I knew his name and more ring go.

Speaker 1:          02:20:08       He has a book that he put together with Louis. Eduardo Luna had good friend of mine, Louis Louis wrote the foreword to my book. Oh, I absolutely have seen this guy before. Yeah. You've seen it. You've seen stuff. Yeah. So amazing. But yeah, that's so he recollects his visions and was able to put them out on to canvas, you know? Wow. Yeah. When, when a guy can do that, like, uh, Alex Grey, especially some of his images, um, they, they appear Egyptian, they appear DMT slash. Egyptian. You know, and I've always wondered like, what is, what is that that you're seeing when you're, when you're seeing this sort of ancient motif and all that, the, it seems, for whatever reason, it seems like a crazy assertion that you're, uh, you're accessing the experiences of all these people that have ever done this, this drug. ButW is it any weirder than cell phones, you know, is that any weirder than the ability to Google something?

Speaker 1:          02:21:09       And that one, Scott, and weird, it's inherently not any weirder than the hobbit in three d. I mean, you could say, yeah. You could say, you know, well, it's a similar experience because these mushrooms activate the same receptors that everybody, and we all have a similar brain architecture and all that. And I think that to a certain extent, that's part of it. But that's not the, that's not the whole story. I mean, again, that comes back to whether, you know, the brain is generating this stuff or whether it's actually, you know, sort of just making the membrane thinner so that you can look at it. Did you have any experience with a sensory deprivation tanks? I haven't had very much with that, no. Wow, that's so crazy. That seems like it'd be right up your alley. You'd think so. Yeah. I haven't experimented with it. Have you been interested in at all? Uh, not really that the, uh, the substances, you know, seem to reliably do it, but yeah, I should, uh, should look into it. I'm a big fan. Are you? Oh yeah. Even just for relaxation, uh, for, just for the body. You do it in conjunction with psychedelics or, yes. Okay. So at night, Sam, eating, eating is my favorite

Speaker 7:          02:22:26       one. Oh yeah. Okay. Eating cannabis and getting to the point where you're, you're like, the way I describe what, I try to describe it as a, when you're so high that you feel like the, the, the parallel dimension, the neighboring dimension is like a waterfall and you've got your nose touching the water and you're right about the push to the other side. That's when you get in the tank. So right when you just, you know that there's a moment when you feel like you've eaten too much, like you had a pop round and you're like, this is not a comfortable feeling. Terrible. I definitely ate too much. That's when he get in the tank. Interesting. And the complete lack of sensory input from the tank along with that just blows the whole experience out of the water. I've had some of the wildest trips in my life, um, from, from doing that, the sensory deprivation tank on its own can put you in some crazy places, but, but about on its own, but it's really good for his relaxation.

Speaker 7:          02:23:19       It's amazing for like loosening you up and just soothing the body. And it's an excellent source of magnesium too, because of the salt and the water. It's Epson salts. So it's one of the best ways for your body to absorb a good amount of magnesium. But I just, I, it's one of the things that I've never understood why more people didn't get into it. I don't knit. Lily. John Lilly was the inventor of it and he used one on a regular basis. I just, I never, I always wanted to know why that didn't catch on. I never heard Karen's talk about it either.

Speaker 4:          02:23:49       No, he, he didn't, he didn't use it as far as I know. Um, I don't know.

Speaker 7:          02:23:55       It's such an amazing resource because he was always in a silent darkness. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:23:58       Well, exactly. Take it. So assignment in, in near total darkness, there's kind of a sensory deprivation. You're still in your body. I mean, he's still are not in this amniotic place, you know? Have you ever tried mushrooms? Will see the isolation tank?

Speaker 7:          02:24:17       No, I have not done well. No, I did it. I have done at once, but I have not done a big dose. I haven't, I haven't done a lot but, but mostly seem to be a good place for it. Good. Yeah. The problem is I have kids and I don't want to be blasted on in my head and that thing and then to have something go wrong and you open the door and reality just hasn't tuned back in yet. You know, you've got to plan your sessions, you need somebody to look after kids. It's hard said aid, all that. One of the things about cannabis, those are eating candy. If, if I get too high, I can still deal with shit. Right. Adrenaline rises. I got a phone call, I can call, I can talk to people, I can come back out of reality. I can get back. It'd be okay. And that combined with the, uh, the sensory depth tank is a, it's a pretty, pretty profound experience. But I think probably if you were into silent dark, the thing about suicide and those that he pulls you out so much, you almost don't even need a sensory dep tank. It's almost like unnecessary. It's unnecessary. Yeah, but by itself.

Speaker 4:          02:25:14       But it would be interesting. It would be interesting if your experience with those things. You, you go first. I'll follow. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:25:22       Well, I have one, I have

Speaker 11:         02:25:23       one in my basement, so I like to use it. I use it all the time. But uh, even just like I said by itself just for relaxation, but I just never understood why more people didn't want to have that. Just as a meditation tool, it's a, as a tool for completely getting alone with your thoughts and just separating yourself from any of the input of the body seems that it would be useful. But Terrence wasn't into that. But he was in the pot on a serious regular basis. God, yes,

Speaker 4:          02:25:54       man. Had the capacity for cannabis that I've never seen in anyone else.

Speaker 7:          02:26:00       Is that part of the reason why he went on these rambling lectures? He's incredible. I mean, he would wind the wind him up and some of the great mp3s that are available on the psychedelic salon of you even familiar with the soccer Exelon, great podcast and Renzo, the guy who hosts it has, I'm just hour upon hour of Terrence's lectures. Amazing, amazing stuff. But what was incredible was that you just, he would just go up there and the wind him up, put him on the stage right when we're in front of the microphone and he would just go on for hours. Just wrap it out. Yeah, it was, I mean, I'm sure he was high as fuck, credit, cannabis,

Speaker 4:          02:26:42       a lot of that, you know, his inspiration, what he was doing was essentially what, you know, what he used to do, I mean, back before anybody knew about him or us or whatever, you know, back in the Berkeley days in the 60s you know, he loved nothing more to that to get a bunch of people in a room, you know, pat pass around hash or some kind of really strong dope, something that would render everybody else completely speechless.

Speaker 11:         02:27:14       They couldn't say anything. And then he would just regale the first

Speaker 4:          02:27:18       hours, you know? And, and he was, and they, everybody was fascinated and mean. He was totally coherent. I mean, everyone, you know, a lot of people, they smoke a lot of cannabis. They get quiet, right? I'm one of those, I can't rap on cannabis very well, but he just, he could do it and that, and then he found not only, you know, if it works for a bedroom full of people, I mean, as you know, and his Hippie crash pad though and Telegraph Avenue, it'll work for audiences all over the world. So he turned it into a shtick and living and thank God he did. You know, cause uh, cause you know, we have all that out there.

Speaker 7:          02:27:58       Thank God he did as well because those recordings and the books and the lectures, those experiences changed the entire direction of a lot of people's lives, including mine. Absolutely. Mine. The first time I did DMT, I literally heard him saying something in the DMT trip. I'd heard his voice saying, right. It was a, it was just, it, his impact I think is, uh, it was unbelievably profound. That ability to relay those thoughts in this really compelling way. Really. I mean, there, I can't tell you how many gigs I've gone on where I had to travel or how to drive. And I just listened to a psychedelic salon, listened to one of the lectures, just so compelling and fascinating. And I think that opens up a completely new lines of thinking for a lot of people

Speaker 4:          02:28:51       does. And you know, it's interesting the, the, the, you know, the currency that this has, he's still out there. He's achieved this weird kind of immortality on the dance. You know what he said when you think about most of this was early nineties when he was talking about this, but you could put a tape on and it's just as timely as though we're other yesterday he has this real feeling for the future and, and you know, people come up to me, a lot of young people come up to me and said, I've, everything I learned, I learned from Terence Mckenna. And it was like before that my life was empty. And now I understand that. And you look at these people in, you say they couldn't have been more than eight or seven or eight when he was at the height of his career. You know, these people, some of were in diapers when he was, you know, at the height of his career. So they discovered him later. Yes. Somehow. And he still had this impact.

Speaker 7:          02:29:53       Well, it's because it's so compelling. It's a very completely viral thing. I mean there's a lot of different people that have a lot of different ideas, but they, whatever, for whatever reason it wasn't compelling. I think it's, uh, uh, what, uh, one of the great things that you're doing in a, in this book is you're not sugarcoating anything. And you know, the way you described your brother is with obviously with great love and respect and admiration, but also great honesty. And I think that's, that's very important. I think it's, it's really, really important for recognizing his true contributions and recognizing that like all of us, he's a human being who was experimenting with all these ideas and sometimes they didn't, they weren't correct. But that's the only way you get to those Id. They have to sort of evolve and form when you have to keep playing with them. And in the nature of that and the nature of like full disclosure, like what were the, like if there's any glaring errors that he had made that people have, uh, either repeated or that they have misinformation because of these glaring error. So like what would it be? What glaring errors did he, or any errors that like

Speaker 4:          02:31:00       deserve mention? I don't know. I'd have to, I'd have to think about, uh, you know, I mean, I, I, it is, it is an effort to depict him. Honestly. I hope that people don't, you know, I hope that people see that. You obviously do, you know, I'd love to him a great deal. I respected him a great deal and, you know, but we had our rifle Reese and like all brothers, you know, we had our sibling rivalries. So, you know, I mean, I loved him deeply. I hated him deeply. It was, you know, that kind of dynamic goes on.

Speaker 1:          02:31:36       Well, when you said earlier that he would say something and you say, well, that didn't make any sense and you just contradicted what you said earlier. Do you have any like specific,

Speaker 4:          02:31:45       well he, he would always respond to the, you know, he didn't like me to go to his seminars so much cause I was the only one that would ever challenge him. Everyone else's list name and sort of slack jawed fascination of his utter in these completely, you know, wild ideas. And I was the only one who would really ever get up and say, well what you've said 20 minutes ago, it doesn't make any sense and it contradicts what you say now. And he would respond with, well consistency is the Hobgoblin of small minds. Describe what a great quote. Right? Oh that's my new message board quote. Cause his actually I think he was, I think he was quoting Walt said that's great. That was so the thing is terrible. It's a like to have fun with ideas, you know. And in some ways people took him too seriously and you know, I mean there was a tendency on the part of some of his constituents to view him as a guru or a, you know, even a cult figure to a certain extent. I think he rejected all that. He didn't want to be a guru. He did see himself as a girl. He wanted to stimulate people to,

Speaker 4:          02:33:06       I think for themselves. You know, that was the thing. Don't believe me, but okay, here's a whole bunch of really crazy ideas. You know,

Speaker 1:          02:33:15       there's a great video with a bunch of images and Terrence's words. Culture is your enemy. If you ever, culture is not your friend. Yes, culture's not your culture's not your friend. It's very quick. But it's so, it's so powerful, even to this day, really. It's, it's, it's so powerful that you, you can listen to it and then watch CNN and not be affected. You can reassess, reassess the impact of modern media. Yeah, exactly. And that's a very,

Speaker 4:          02:33:40       that's a very valuable one because in fact, culture isn't the year friend. And a lot of what, uh, what Terrance's point again, think for yourself. Don't believe what anybody tells you. You know, and psychedelics are a challenge to that. All these people that dismiss the psychedelic experience, as you rightly point out, they haven't had it, you know? Or if they have, they didn't pay attention, you know, so, so their opinions count for nothing. I mean, they're like the people, you know, they're like the

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       Dutch lens makers who built telescopes, but you know, refuse to look through the telescopes because that was a blast from Isac. Sure. It's the same thing. The Brotherhood of the screaming abyss. It is available right now. I have it in my hand. It was all funded through Kickstarter because people wanted to get this information. You, you, you spend a year about a, we discussed, we talked about this about December in 2011. Right? This is when we first were in contact three. Yeah. But I actually started, well, it took about 18 months to write the book.
