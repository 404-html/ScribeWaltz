Speaker 1:          00:03          I remember I took some mushrooms one time to a, a party in high school because I grew up in an area where you could just get mushrooms, psychedelic mushrooms grew on everything. They grow in your fucking cousins back and we took a long enough nap, let you grow up in Louisiana. They grew everywhere out there or they grab work because everybody had something shitting in their yard and then it would rain every single day for about a half hour. Right. So it was just. I mean, you see people picking them and eating them and families out there and join them in the afternoon. I mean it was. Everybody was, oh, it was psychedelic heaven. So we would ride out and go get them. I remember one time getting a trash bag of probably about 35 pounds of mushrooms. Right? And one time a golden retriever came running at us across this field and we thought he was pissed because we were tripping.

Speaker 1:          00:46          And then he got to us. We ran for like a half mile, he got to us finally. We're crawling away from thinking he's evil and he just fucking love this. And licked mean golden retriever. He thought he was mean for us because the hair, his hair was kind of slick back like an evil golden retriever. So no, I took that back and busters to that party and a bunch of people ate a mood, never had them before. And then we played a game of hide and go seek. Right? I was like, no, you know, hide in another dimension. I'll count you guys go hide. Right. And I never went to fucking look for Tim at the. I've never seen that dude again.
