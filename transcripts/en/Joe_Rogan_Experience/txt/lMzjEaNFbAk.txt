Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Doo doo, Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.

Speaker 1:          00:00:07       Boom. Yes. We're live. Hello, Eric. Hello Joe. Thanks for doing this, man. I'm. Jamie had a question. You're, you're not related to that. Other fellow to other one team fell. It's in trouble right now. Bret Weinstein. No. That's your brother. The other guy. Weinstein or the other guy? Yeah. I don't know him. Okay. That other guy's in trouble. Like two more women. Angelina Jolie and they both came out today. Yeah. I don't think it's going to stop there. Uh, seems like you might've had a little bit of an issue and that amazing that someone can get away with something like that for so long and then one or two people come clean and the walls come down. The oppressive fist of just his fucking tyranny, whatever that guy did. Yeah. I mean, I think it does speak to the idea that power really exists in an industry in a town like this.

Speaker 1:          00:01:07       It's always been the. That's been the Cliche, right? The casting couch, right? Yes. But I didn't know in the modern era how much, uh, how much power any still had. Yeah. I wonder, you know, it's just, and it's also like super left wing guy, you know, like really politically connected to social justice ideologies, fighting gun control. I mean, you know, promoting gun control and stumping for Hillary and all this. Yeah, it seems like overcompensation. I didn't want to bring this up right up front about that. We were going to talk about cuddle fish. I asked you to save the cuttlefish and just cuddled conversation about little fish.

Speaker 2:          00:01:50       Well, we were talking about,

Speaker 2:          00:01:54       I mean all of these are just incredible hot button topics, but we were talking before about your Ra, your conversation on um, male and female programming in the mind on male and female, a biological frames. And what I was, what I was going to talk about there was that you can actually have in other species which aren't nearly as controversial as humans. I'm irrational basis for something like transphobia in an evolutionary context. So the giant cuttle fish, which I think is called Sepia Pama. I'm not a biologist. I'm the males are incredibly large. They're very sexually dimorphic and you've got these tiny or smaller males who don't have a good strategy for keeping a lot of females underneath them were so the males are incredibly larger that females are incredibly large. The females tend to be much smaller when the females are impressed. They accept shelter underneath one of these giant males, but then you have these other males who aren't nearly as big, um, which might be called sneaker males.

Speaker 2:          00:03:09       And the sneaker males start retracting the tentacles that identify them as male and changing through their chromatin fours. They're sort of their presentation to look female. And then the giant males invite these males disguised as females through behavioral change underneath. And we've now proven, I believe that these sneaker males inseminate the females. Well, the larger males are getting duped now. Are the larger males larger because they just have better genetics or are they larger because they're older? Well, you know, the question about better genetics. Key question is who leaves the lineages that matter over time? So if you're wasting all of your energy on a strategy, and in fact what you're doing is you're providing protection for sneaker males to get busy with the females who seemed to be equally happy to reward a devious male as a strong one. You know, I'm a put in mind of the old, the Willie Dixon Blues Song.

Speaker 2:          00:04:18       I'm a backdoor man. The men don't know, but the little girls understand, um, you know, definitely a female's favor. A variety of strategies, whether communicating strengthened, dominance, cleverness, a or anything that females are likely to decide, uh, will benefit their offspring. Yeah, that's a, that's a great name for them to sneaker males. Is that like the tactical mail at the technical term for those small males? I've seen it in lizards and I don't know the Sepia Pama giant cuttle fish system, but I'm, I'm obsessed with cephalopod, so I should probably go back and do some homework on them. I didn't know we would be starting out with Harvey Weinstein again. Giant, giant cuttle fish Weinstein versus Weinstein. That's the difference. I'm definitely keeping that distinction. Yeah, it's a good distinction now. Right now. It's good to make a separation. So I'm cephalopods including cuttlefish octopus, squids, novelists, and then they all sort of came from mollusks, right? This is the craziest thing in the world, right? I mean, we're not, we're not guaranteed to meet an alien intelligence during our lifetimes, but the idea that such genius exists in mollusks where you least expect it and, um, is probably the closest we're ever going to get to aliens. So, I mean, I think that it's sort of, there's a secret, uh, international conspiracy, um, people who have realized this and, you know, just freak out on cephalopods and they know, they know every crazy thing that cephalopods have been proven to, to understand and um,

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       you know, where their cognitive capabilities, uh, just sort of wow us, have the cognitive capabilities, their camouflage capabilities, the strategies that they use for attacking a bait fish. And there's a video that I put up on my twitter really recently have a cuddle fish that opens up like a flower and shoots its tongue out and gets this fish and then just sucks it into his body. And it's like you're looking at some kind of an alien that's totally an mean, I forget, is that like seven fold symmetry or you know, it's really on a different branch of the phylogenetic tree and I think that the dazzled patterns where you just start seeing these neon signs that are effectively made out of the chromatin fours and if you've seen the videos where people put them on against like really artificial patterns like chess boards or Chins are things and the cuttlefish has to figure out, okay, how do I blend in with that?

Speaker 3:          00:06:51       Yeah. Yeah. And they do their best to market, but the natural world, they mimicked perfectly well not really. I think was it octopus can do it, some octopus can do it. I think what happens is the pie. Yeah, that's, I don't know that one. Um, I guess it's Octopi. I think what they do is they actually sort of do much less than we are imagining. And they used the fact that we, our brains are interpolated. So they're in part, not matching the background as well as we think, but they're doing it well enough that our brains sort of make up the difference. That's weird. I mean, but what, what would be the difference between the way we interpret their, their visual, uh, what, what, what, whatever camouflage they're giving off because it's a visual camouflage, right? Yeah. If you look at some of the, uh, some of the camouflage videos, like the first seven times you see it, you can't imagine.

Speaker 3:          00:07:51       Yeah. Uh, but then after, after awhile you say, Oh wow, there really is a difference. And Somehow, um, I just, I did the interpolation to help out that which is trying to escape my detection. Well, I mean there's definitely a distinction you can kinda tell once you look at it, but it's so insanely impressive and comparison to pretty much, almost every other life form. You know, what they can do in terms of like they could change their texture. That's one of the, like when they, when they sit on a coral reef and they start looking like a coral reef, like, whoa. Have you, uh, have you checked out the mimic octupus? Yes. Right. So that one, five or six different disguises. Yeah. Uh, I, I can't even imagine that. Usually when you have mimicry, it's dedicated or obligate like a, you know, a stick bug or a leaf insect. It's only going to do that one trick. You, you know, what's interesting too is like I've heard a real legitimate argument for people that are opposed to eating animal protein that a mollusks especially like clams and mussels and things along those lines are more primitive

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       in terms of their ability to recognize or have any, any sense of what pain is, any sort of communication, any sort of interpretation of danger that all they do is just close. Right. And that in closing we've interpreted that to being an animal and that this animal life form is like, it's like eating a living thing versus like eating plants. But I've heard it argued it actually. Sam Harris was the first one to bring it up. This is actually a moral argument that they sense less than plants do and that they are more, they're more primitive than plants are, but yet from the [inaudible] family, you have octopus and there's a good argument that you probably shouldn't be knocked a post. Like you shouldn't beat monkeys, you know, like an octopus is fucking smart. Like crazy. Sneaky. Smart. It's them or us, Joe. Oh, that's good. I mean, in that case they are delicious. Yeah. I think if you ever look at Humboldt Squid, um, you know, schooling and descending as one of the greatest nightmares of all time. I think I've seen a humboldt squid as a humboldt squid sometimes if we get. They called the red devils are the coast of Baja California and they're just social in. They're terrifying because they attack in groups. So the planet or the coordinate in some way

Speaker 2:          00:10:16       in some way. I mean, obviously the chromatophores must have some ability to do signaling. And I think that with respect to w, we have to figure out, um, whether it's really intelligence that causes us to become empathic because obviously if you're at war and you think highly of your enemy, you have to guard against your own empathy so that you can be an effective warrior. You have to ask the question, uh, you know, if monkeys and apes are among the most intelligent beings, do I actually feel some revulsion for just how savage chimpanzees are as compared to say bonobos are givens.

Speaker 1:          00:10:56       Yeah. Isn't that the real argument or the, the real fascinating conversation is what happened on in the evolutionary chain. Like why did banabos become these peaceful sexual creatures and champs become these warring savage psychos, like what they look so similar. Like what happened? Well, that, that one,

Speaker 2:          00:11:18       no, but there's an interesting system in Dung. Beetles were, um, if you look at the armaments that they have on their head, um, uh, for warring between males, there's a conserved quantity between the length of the Copula Tory apparatus and the size of the weaponry. So the more weapons, the smaller the penises. And so, you know, there are all these crazy tradeoffs in apes between relative testicular size, in peanut size

Speaker 1:          00:11:51       for gorillas, gorillas have tiny little

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       penises, but enormous bodies and giant fangs and tiny penis. Yeah, I guess. Yeah. And chimpanzees have big penises and testicles both. Yeah. See they said that chimpanzees, there's a direct correlation between promiscuous females and the size of their testicles. Hmm. I don't, I don't remember that one. But yeah, the question about. I also worry that we've, um, we've idealized the banabos too much and you know, we were sort of, it's very hard to be empathetic with the chimps after Jane Goodall showed us what they're capable of. Um, but in part, uh, you know, the, the cold logic of the natural world,

Speaker 4:          00:12:39       um,

Speaker 3:          00:12:41       in general, you know, it's usually some reason that makes complete sense. It's, it can't be sentimental anytime you bring sentimentality, uh, and you usually screw up a good theory. Um, and so, you know, I, I, I worry that our comparisons are driven by our needs to, to locate ourselves a farther away from chimpanzees and closer to something that we, we feel comfortable. So are idealizing the Banabos is not necessarily based on what they actually are, but based on like our little sort of hippie version of life, like, look, we could be like the banabos loving and sexual and affectionate, or we can be like the warring horrible, horrible chimpanzees. Well, you know, it's also the case that, uh, how great does it feel to be sexual if you're being sexually out competed by others? It's always unfunded to be, you know, low status and nature has different ways of punishing and rewarding a status and achievement in, in various, uh, the various different species. So my guess is, is that there is a kind of concise conserved,

Speaker 4:          00:13:52       um,

Speaker 3:          00:13:54       you know, unpleasantness and losing each particular game and a pleasure and winning each particular game. And that's, that's essentially how nature keeps moving forward. Right? Yeah. Um, you know, to the extent that, uh, you're wasting energy. I'm warring when you could be being constructive or being more strategic, uh, you're going to get out competed by whichever, uh, members, uh, of your species, you know, figure out the puzzle first. And so I think that,

Speaker 4:          00:14:24       um,

Speaker 3:          00:14:27       you know, there's this concept of the naturalistic fallacy of, of viewing that which, uh, you know, if you assume that we carry some sort of Judeo Christian baggage and all of this, uh, was thought to come from a, a creator who was thought to have positive characteristics than, well, obviously the natural world is God's work. But I mean if you actually look at the systems that fascinate me, the creator would have to be about the most twisted consciousness. A consciousness you could possibly imagine.

Speaker 1:          00:14:58       Well, it seems like it's, it's the long game. The creators playing the creators not playing the game that favors the, the health and the welfare of the individual. And the current day. It's the matter of like figuring out how to get through this brutal game and advancing and evolving along the way to the point where some day in the future you find a more complex and evolving

Speaker 3:          00:15:20       system. But this is

Speaker 1:          00:15:24       the most complex and evolved. This us, you and me, humans, most complex and evolved system in terms of its ability to change its environment that we've ever come across. And we're not too happy with ourselves.

Speaker 3:          00:15:35       Yeah. Although I do think that despite our barbarism, we are that which can contemplate the game and you know, at some point you've obviously had my brother on the street on the show. I asked him as an evolutionary theorists, Brett, what are you doing? You know, you're married to one woman and you've had two kids, uh, as an evolutionary theorists, don't you think you're throwing the game? And his response was, I think, brilliant. It was a. and tell me, Eric, if you understood the game, why would you want to continue to play it? Right? So for him it was almost like a sort of proof that, um, if you really get, you know, another one of his good quotes is that a life when properly understood is a spelling bee that ends in genocide. That we're also focused on our nucleotide sequences. Do you really care about the particular way in which you did digest lactose?

Speaker 3:          00:16:34       Uh, different from how I do it that you want to go to war with me. So we can spell the future using your version rather than mine. Maybe you, you'd feel this way about your ideas, about, you know, your songs, your stories, but really you really want to fight over like things that neither of us care about. Like what, what are you saying? Well, if you're trying to think about like, I want to leave seven children, okay, why do you want to do that? Well, because I want to see more copies of myself. Well you will see a certain number of copies of yourself, but that's going to get diluted very quickly by the time we get to your great, great grandchildren's can be hard to see yourself in your offspring. So that's sort of an illusion of one generation, two generations. Most of the things that are going to determine your genes a propagating. I'm have to do with the fact that you're on a team. There are a bunch of people who digest milk the way you do. And so the key question is, you know, team Rogan on the milk digestion is some huge number of people you've never met. That's what I understand. Like why I don't understand the connection to milk digestion. It's just one thing that your body is doing in a particular way. So, you know, like, let's

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       take eichler maybe that's more familiar. So, you know, I, I know that I have a blue illegal that is being suppressed in terms of its expression. Do I really care that um, you know, if my wife has two brown illegals, um, does it matter to me that my blue somehow survives? Do I care that I want it to survive enough against some brown eyed person? It'd be interesting if you had a checklist of like what things that you would agree upon, like you and the wife get together, say, okay, so, uh, this ability, what do you think? You know, who's who side? We go on with intelligence. You're a little smarter than me. I'm going to give it to you. Let's go with. Let's go with your brains. Yeah. Okay. I'm better at smelling things like, how do you. I'm just allergic to cats. Let's have none of the kids fucking sneeze.

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       Every time they go near a litter box was the great thing was just flip a coin. Yeah, let's do it a couple of times and whatever we get we get. I, I worry about a crispr cas, nine people are going to be having these, like, I'll trade you this for that. We're gonna have crazy. Yeah, I'm fascinated by crispr. I mean I think most people aren't even aware of it. People like you of course are people who are paying attention are, but I think to the general public has no idea that crispr even exists and it's potentially world changing. I mean you're literally looking at the tools that will eventually lead. Much like, you know, Alexander Graham Bell's invention led to you having the Internet in your pocket. Right? Slowly but surely. I mean, you, you're looking at the tools that will one day lead to us engineering some completely new organism that you're going to call human beings.

Speaker 1:          00:19:26       Yeah. I think that's going to be a long time off. Alexander Graham Bell was a long time off and I think, well, I bet it's less time than that. Okay. When was that? Was the 18 hundreds? What are the odds? Two thousand 17 to the late 18 hundreds. You don't take 21 slash 17, we're going to behave a fucking incredible hulks and thor's and women look like wonder woman. There's not going to be a single troll like looking person left and the one that I think we're going to be able to do a lockdown. Yeah, I think we're going to be able to do a lot more competent torics of swapping something in that's known to work and swapping something out. But when we actually get to like authorship, we were like, okay, I got this great idea for a human being. I'm going to start from scratch.

Speaker 1:          00:20:10       Uh, there's a lot of optimism that, um, for which I am the pessimist, you know, uploading the mind to a computer. Yeah. You pet Kurzweil's ideas. Yeah. Well, not in the sense that we're never going to get anywhere close, but just 1:45. That's what they're aiming for. I mean, I'm optimistic about certain things that turned out to be a lot easier than we expected. I think that a lot of things that are or we thought were going to require artificial general intelligence are going to succumb to much simpler systems and so you know, you might've thought that, for example,

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       if you played through the great chess games, have a, you know, the 18 hundreds, like morphe in Anderson and things, you might say, well that's just a uniquely human activity and then you find out, no, no computers can trounce humans at chess because it's not. It wasn't what you thought it was. Maybe music will be the next thing to succumb because that's really highly regular, but music is also intensely creative and emotive, right? It, it, it, it, it sparks feeling in humans and, and I don't think you could really, I don't know. I mean maybe you could, but I don't think you really could figure out a way to engineer or have a computer engineer something that makes you feel like led Zepplin the immigrant song. You know, there's just like a bizarre feeling to someone's art that comes through when you listened to it and you're like, oh, this is a fucking great.

Speaker 3:          00:21:44       You know, like where I don't, I don't necessarily know you could do that with something that doesn't understand emotions or is using a replica of emotions. Whereas chess, you know, you know, a rook move this way upon can move that way. Here's the rules. This is how it starts. This is what once you get here, you're in check. Like those things seem pretty straightforward. You're dealing with squares. It's very mathematic. You know, one person moves in, another one moves. Whereas like there's like this fluid nature to art literature and music and the other half of that I think I disagree. Really? Yeah. I mean, so I don't know why you chose the immigrant that that's why, because I'm going to go to cryotherapy after this. That's the domino's to do.

Speaker 3:          00:22:32       It's just a good song. So if we, if you'd taken, if you'd, if you'd taken a Roy orbison's pretty woman. Okay. Right. So do you have the main riff from that song had like walking down the street due to come to America or that we're going after the um, the riff is like, dude, dude did it. Who Do do it? It, it, it, it did it right, so if you start, if you take a guitar string and you split it into four equal parts, you put your finger over a one quarter of the string and then you start just plucking a string and hovering above the string so you don't actually push it to the fret board. Those notes occur naturally as the harmonics in the expansion of the vibrating string so that those notes were not really chosen by Roy orbison or whoever wrote the song. They were really chosen by like a four day series and it feels like it's a, a rift. But I discovered this when I was in Indonesia as I would start playing that and people would react and I felt like why that song? What about more complex creative and sort of improvisational song like food who child from Hendrix. So I don't know

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       about Voodoo child. What I mean take take. It changes up. So if you look at the first couple of cords of red house, there's like some seventh or diminished chord, like he's arpeggiated Nana, and then he moves it down a half step, which has to do with this tritone substitution and the symmetry inside of the seventh chord. So if I recall correctly, you have a chord like C, e, g, e, b flat would be a c seven chord and the e and the b flat would form this thing called a triton. And now if you went in the blues, you, there are three elements of the chord progression, the dominant subdominant and the tonic. If you go down a half step, you effectively invert the third in the flat seventh. Uh, so if you go one half step below that, it's the flat seventh and the third I think, of the subdominant court.

Speaker 2:          00:24:50       So Hendrix is actually playing with math in something as basic as. Do you think he's aware of it or do you think he's doing it sort of just instinctual? Well, first of all, when you're visited by an alien intelligence, we went through cuddle fish and we now we've gotten into Jimi Hendrix, so that's like, these are the, these are the best alien sightings we have. It's very hard to speculate, but I, I, I just look at everything I've been able to understand about what he did and you know, you're dealing with a supermind as well as an intuitive mastery, mastery of the instrument, complete understanding of the chords and progressions and just the ability to improvise and to make it sound different. Adding the Wah Wah pedal and all that distortion and all the shit that he used and the fact that he imparts more into one note, like, I wouldn't even know how to notate mean what is even the instrument.

Speaker 2:          00:25:44       You didn't play the guitar. He played the guitar amplification. You signal processing system as a whole. Yeah. So there are these people who are just in some multidimensional space. Another one of my favorites is a guy named Roy Buchanan, who somehow these guys who understand harmonics gravitate to telecasters and um, you know, pull a song called Roy's blues and watch him just go into the multiverse and start playing with things that you can't even imagine are possible. So I do think that there's a very close relationship between algorithms and emotion and I just did this one for an old tweet of mine where I wrote a python program that actually runs from the tweets of the entire program is in the tweet and it's purpose is to generate the chord progression for Pachelbel's, which is if you want people to cry at a wedding, that's the chord progression to play. And so the idea that it's actually an algorithm that breaks your heart, it is very frightening. Uh, just

Speaker 1:          00:26:56       some insane noise in the background here folks. They're doing some shit to our roof. These are the last days that were in the studio by the way, which is hilarious that it's sort of highlighting why we need to get the fuck outta here. But I don't know what they're doing to this. I mean, does he even ran anymore? Why will they do with fixing the roof? Put a fucking top up their assholes. The guy even asked me right before the show, he's like, what time do you take? I told him, it's like, oh, well that's right about the time we're letting explosions right above your head. Sorry for people listening to this. Like, what the fuck is that noise? That's the noises banging around the roof pinned down by enemy fire. Yeah. Well, I mean I think it's also me as a, as a human, I probably have some bias, some stupid idea that creativity is impossible to recreate. You know that whatever it leads to a person being able to make some beautiful song or create some amazing book is impossible for some sort of a computer to figure that out on its own.

Speaker 2:          00:27:59       Well, if you've. I would go ahead and hang out in a modern recording studio and watch the move the beat around and mutated and change it. Or if you think about like that moment where share said, hey, I don't think autotune should be used to correct my voice in a sly way, I'm going to use this as the instrument itself and suddenly this metallic voice I'm actually isn't, becomes an anthem. And you start, you know, Robo share is incredibly inspiring.

Speaker 1:          00:28:32       Do you remember a Peter Frampton, he was one of the first guys to use it in a song. Do you feel like I do.

Speaker 2:          00:28:37       So he used that thing with his mouth. They had a tube in his mouth. So he's really actually using his body to shape. He's using the, it's like this five dimensional lattice in your, in your mouth to produce the international phonemic alphabet. So your, your nose could be on or off. That's one degree of freedom. You can have vocalization on or off vocalization, meaning you can have. You're like F, F, F as in Frank Versus v as in victory. They're the same mouth, right? But right. So you just vibrating your throat so you can have no vocalization. So is in the throat somewhere. Frank, you fucking boomer like s versus z would be another pair. Okay, so the sound that you're making with your throat and then you have like your lips and one of three positions. So that's a third degree of freedom than your tongue can be in one of five positions and it can be fully elevated,

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       half elevated or not elevated at all. So there's like five parameter family that generates what's called the international phonemic alphabet. And um, you know, one of the cool things to think about is how could you create an instrument that naturally allowed you phonemic productions that you're not just doing these simple ringing tones? Well, there's gotta be a way to just recreate it physically, right? That just make an artificial head and maybe we just made an artificial head with. I mean, it's not like we do something that's impossible to recreate with a robot. Okay. But like in terms of if you take the collection of all major instruments, what comes closest to the human voice? A lot of people think it's the, uh, Indian violin called the Sarangi. Really? Yeah. You never check that out. What's a Sarangi? A Sarangi is like a. can we use it to drown out the pounding on the roof? We'd win a Sarangi yeah. I've never even heard of it. It sounds bad ass. It's so. It's a strange. Violin is a strange violence. A lot of sympathetic strings and um, you know, because of you can power into a note. You if you, if I have a guitar and I pluck a string, I'm just going to get decay unless I drive the sound right. But if I do with my voice. Oh look how cool that thing looks. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:31:11       Wow. Louder. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:31:20       Just trying to imagine like a lot of those are sympathetic strings. So they ring when you hit the tone perfectly.

Speaker 5:          00:31:26       Whoa.

Speaker 3:          00:31:31       Let me see. So if you've never gotten into north Indian classical music, this is today's your lucky day. This is really cool. It's wild looking thing, man. It only has three strings. Yeah. My guess is, I mean I don't recall, but very often you will need to know what that one looks kind of old. It looks beat up fucking amazing. You felt amazing rum. Know Ryan on this thing. He was like the ultimate, ultimate Badass and the Sarangi I'm learning, so almost died out. It almost died. I think it was like, it was used for guzzle singing and courtesans used to play it. What's that guzzle singing guzzles like his type of, uh, of song that would be popular in what would now be Pakistan in northern India funded Drumna Ryan decided to check this dude out. Do you remember Zam fear? Master of the pamphlet. Have those late night ads. Remember that? That should have died off quicker. I am that old.

Speaker 5:          00:32:38       That

Speaker 1:          00:32:38       pamphlet thing really never caught on. This is way better than the pamphlets. Do you think this guy has groupies? I know he does. Does he teach yoga too? It seems like you would. Um, well, so you see the drums on the left or right? Yeah. So that's

Speaker 2:          00:33:01       the tabla and the [inaudible] and that is the, you know, I think many people would consider north Indian drumming to be the world's most advanced rhythmic system. Really? Yeah. I mean, even, even more than Africa. Um, the speed of articulation, it goes at the speed of speech and if you take the Hindi verb to speak bold, they have the system that they call the bowls and to speak the bowls is to say what you would instruct your hands to do if you were playing.

Speaker 1:          00:33:32       Wow. Look at him. I've heard sounds like this before for sure. Like A, I'm a fan of dollar mandate, like dollar Mindy's music. Okay. Let's get some cool music and he has this kind of shit in the background a lot. Do you know who he is? Right? I do not. You don't know who dollar Mendez I should. What is the song? The big famous song? A thing? It's called Tunic tunic tune. It's really a bad ass song. It's a, I really love music where I don't know what they're saying. You know, I, I enjoy that because it's just like, you just kinda get a feel for the song. You have no idea what the actual words where they could be totally corny. You know? See if you can find some

Speaker 2:          00:34:14       thing like speaking the bowls for Tabla and you'll see these guys doing this

Speaker 1:          00:34:19       thing where they decorated the tree, didn't know that. You know what they do, places that they create with their mouths, everything that their fingers would do with their hands so they can act that song, that song. We were just playing what's totally cut off this business. He's got a bad ass. I have no idea what he's saying. You guys hilarious music video too. The music is like, it's not bad ass. It's him against him in this video, but he arrested for like a white slavery. Well that's good. Yeah. He got arrested. Jesus. What? It was like sex trafficking or something like that. Some kind of slave trade, sex slave trafficking or something like that. He was a part of some, I don't know, maybe he just pissed off the wrong guy in India and I guess they'd fucking hit him with some bullshit charge. You never know. You know? Weird countries like that. They can get away with a lot of shit. What does it brother just died? I guess that's taking over the news on his name. Anyway. Sorry. So, um, what does that do? Those drums called again,

Speaker 3:          00:35:39       often just called tableau, but tableau is the sort of soprano drum and then the, the beyond, I guess you play with sort of the heel of your hands. You strike it and go, Huh. And I think the, you know, the world's best practitioner is this guy lives in marine county now, soccer Hussein, who's the child of America who was like the bad ass of his time and it's one of these things where I think you sort of have to be born almost into the family to have this passed down. How do you know all this stuff? This is something you've studied for a long time. There is an amazing book by guy named Neil Surreal that I picked up in college and I just opened it up and it went through an entire performance, uh, of Indian, north Indian classical music. And I was just, you know, my jaw was on the floor.

Speaker 3:          00:36:35       How has the entire form of classical music much closer to our jazz. So much more impressive. I mean, visually to watch one of these drummers and one of these soloists, the soloists, we'll try to lose the drummer and the drummer's got these mirror neurons that can't be beat and he'll just like follow him everywhere and so you're just, you know, some, some, a poor white kid in America saying, nobody told me this existed. Yeah, it's weird how we just choose a certain series of instruments that represent rock and roll certain series of instruments that represent jazz. You know, it's really strange when you think of the wide range of musical instruments that exist all over the world that are just never utilized in modern music. Yeah. And I do think that we've become too complacent. We should be like Ian Anderson with Jethro Tull. Why? If you listen to the flute Solo and locomotive breath, that'll get me going every God damn time.

Speaker 3:          00:37:36       And why didn't I take, I didn't take it off. Yeah. Um, you know, uh, the clarinet was lost to jazz, used to be this incredibly dominant instrument and coming out of the Klezmer tradition, you know, it rocked and then it sort of became this non thing. And at some point I saw a guy named Tony Scott who was like the last great clarinetist and jazz who went off to Japan to study zen for years and he came back for a birthday concert and he blew dizzy Gillespie and Benny Carter off the stage. I was just thinking like, oh, I forgot. Clarinet can be the kick kickass instrument. Yeah. Most people think of it as something you're forced to take in high school. Yeah. But fundamentally that's where like the youth, the Ukulele has come back like crazy. The UKULELE was a Mexican instrument that was introduced to Hawaii. Right? Isn't that what your gaze? I think, but it got an. It's a, a big thing

Speaker 6:          00:38:36       in Hawaii, right? Are they into the Ukulele? I think it came over with cattle ranchers. I think it was introduced to Hawaii by people who brought over like cowboys, like if I remember, I might be butchering the story. So forgive me my Hawaiian friends. But I think what it, what it was was they had introduced cattle at some point in the history of Hawaii and when they introduced cattle, they're like, hey, uh, how do you keep these fucking things from wandering all over the place? So man, we got to find some cowboys, teach us how to do this shit. And they got some, it was either Mexican or South American cowboys to come over and show them how to wrangle these cows, how to, how to corral them, how to, how to take care of them. And then when they did these cowboys came over and introduced the Ukulele, which is really kind of uniquely Hawaiian in art in America. When we think about it, you know, you hear like a sound of the Ukulele. We, we sort of think about it as well, like my daughter's a musician and when we're in Hawaii I got her Ukulele. Like she, you, she plays it. We think about it. It's like in a lot of people's eyes, like a lot of like what we think of as classic Hawaiian Music is played with a Ukulele. Really?

Speaker 1:          00:39:47       Yeah. So I think I'm going to fuck up that history was I thought it was like a portrait. I think it's Oakland Lily. It's like jumping flee. So it's on wine name on a Portuguese instrument. What's that? That's it. Make a pdf says they attributed to a three Portuguese immigrants and the 18 eighties that developed it from three other guitar lick instruments from Portugal. Quality Cava keynote. That's the origin of the Ukulele. But how did it get to Hawaii as they were in Hawaii? Oh, they were in Hawaii. Those guys were in Hawaii. Oh. So they brought it to a why the guys who made it? That's what wikipedia says. So, but it's not wikipedia. I'll say Brian Collins, my brother and I have some weird diseases that I don't really have.

Speaker 1:          00:40:32       Pt is awesome. I just love the fact that he's led people just edit it. Like anytime there's a podcast and something fucked up happens, you go to the person's wikipedia page and they'll totally butcher it. Well, the amazing thing is is that it works at all. Yes. That's it. That is amazing. It is amazing. I never would have guessed that. Yeah, right. Like some user edited thing that sort of what, what's amazing also because there's only one snopes, you know, like there's only one like real well regarded fact checking website. Like someone will say like, Hey, I want you to snopes that. Right. I wouldn't, I wouldn't anymore. I'm distressful. You'd stressed about distrustful, distrustful of snopes. Why? Why do you feel like they're left leaning or do you feel like they're just not necessarily 100 percent honest or what do you think well, or do you think the guide gets a lot of hookers and blow and not really pay attention. Sometimes guys, the history of it, it's fucking hilarious guy. He just shacks up with some escort and she becomes the main editor.

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       I'm going to have some more dmt before. I think that a one. I think that the ICU not needed to sort fact from fiction at the moment is enormous. The amount of money you'd need would be. Oh yeah, right. Fantastic. Actually today with Hashtag fake news. So I am, um, I'm sort of feeling like I'm witnessing the battle for whether any authority exists at all and the claim that you fact check has been synonymized with the fact that you're truthful, which is total nonsense. In other words, if I accurately represent three people who were in a, in a scene and I, and I leave out to others and somebody says that fact you know, that that picture is fake. I said, no, no, no. These three people really were there. Yes, but you filtered out those other things, you know, you can tell lies by leaving things out by insinuation. Uh, I have this whole riff on, um, what I, uh, frequently refer to as Russell conjugation that other people call it motive conjugation. So, you know, the difference between fink versus whistle blower is how I usually introduce this. You have, these are technically synonyms in English, but you cannot substitute one for the other. Whistleblower don't. Well with whistleblowers, the only is usually one of the only positive ones. Chelsea manning is a highly regarded rat, can't. It doesn't work because of the emotional shading.

Speaker 2:          00:43:19       Like another thing is to get somebody proximate to something very disturbing. So Ben Shapiro and I were in this article about how the alt right was outraged and we were like the two people cited neither supposed to be outright you, right? Jesus Christ. Alright thing is a weird thing to know. It's a great game. You have to appreciate what it is. Okay? So if you're trying to silence the very small number of people who are probably your guests [inaudible] I'm the right thing to do is to make sure that their proximate to lots of terrible stuff so that people who are too busy to sort things out so well, you know, I neither condemned nor condone because all you're trying to do is to muddle everything. You need enough fear, uncertainty and doubt in order to get the job done. And so it doesn't matter that the article says, you know, in the banner headline outright enraged, and then the two people you know, listed are like Jews who opposed trump. But because when, when those articles are parsed, um, it shows up as while

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       you were in a bunch of articles about the outright. Yeah. Okay. So I get it. You're really not paying attention and uh, the, the point isn't to inform the reader. The point is to tag that which you wish to neutralize. And so it's working very well. Do people in the alt right consider themselves outright, um, or did they use to when it's become sort of a pejorative? So, so, so let's go through the craziness here. Assume that you are not a democrat. I'm not a Democrat, might translate to libertarian. The more Republicans, Republican translates to right of center, right? Of Center, translates to right wing, translates to far, right, translates to outright translates to white supremacist, translates to Neo Nazi, translates to Nazi, right? And so you have these very strange chains on the left were Republican, keeps bleeding into Nazi, right? Because of this very weird thing.

Speaker 3:          00:45:31       It's like, well, you said, you said you didn't vote Democrat. So I. Can I say that you're right wing. I mean your far right, right. You're, you're basically outright, she's holy crap, you just, you know, moved somebody who's a country club Republican into being a Capo, a agent, you know, and does not necessarily mean white supremacists are the, they conveniently glued those two things together. I think Richard Spencer, um, considers himself all right. Well, I think he coined outright so, you know, the ideas, white supremacy with a human face and a human faces as opposed to wildland a goat. No, he was trying, he was trying to change the, it was trying to come up with a friendlier version of Nazi or a white supremacist Solaris. Right? And so at some level that was a disgusting intellectual master stroke, but then alright, became the play thing.

Speaker 3:          00:46:28       Um, you know, a lot of people who are tired of being told what to think and who to be started blurring these distinctions. So now you've got this frog and sometimes you put a hat on the frog, sometimes it's the Nazi hat, sometimes the trump hat. Right? And so the whole idea is like, okay, um, for those of us who got used to those lines that we do not cross, those were major transgressions to other people. They're like, well why should there be a rule about a frog? Right. And so you have this crazy discussion where you have people with terrible insidious intent, people who are just clowning around and everybody is mixed in in a way that nobody can sort out. Right? Like the frog. That's Keck, right? Yeah. I mean if you really pay attention and I think there's been some sort of a study done on what percentage of the frog is actually used for, you know, Donald trump or racism or outright.

Speaker 3:          00:47:25       And what percentage of the frog is used just for goof. It's the vast majority is like feels good man type things. But like maybe seen, I get sent to many Nazi frogs during the election. I've been sent a few, right? Like anybody could make one make a Nazi and people have made this mickey mouse. But you know, we didn't use to like there's still a lot of stigma around reproducing swastikas with the color scheme and the orientation of the Third Reich to have you seen that the gay folks, for what? For a very short period of time, we're trying to co op the swastika and turned into a rainbow swastika. Take it back. Oh my gosh. Well, when you go to India, right? You have the swastikas, you know, pointing the other direction with dots in them. And so if you come from an American context, you're just fucking triggered all this place up here.

Speaker 3:          00:48:19       There's a place in Chatsworth, I believe, that is in a very, very old Indian temple that has swastikas on it. And there's a large sign but it's not. It's reverse swastika is a large sign explaining, you know, hey, this is an ancient Hindu symbol and we've had it for a long time and longer. Right? I mean, my guess I haven't looked at the, at the etymology, but I would guess that swag comes from beautiful in Sanskrit or something. And so, you know, the question about who does assemble belong to and when is an inexorable and when is it an extra bowl, when is it a, like that symmetry pattern. I have no question that you might find that symmetry pattern in nature or you know, in like ninth century Islamic art architecture or something. Well, you know, the hexagon they found on top of Jupiter, remember that the storm, you know, what, if it was a swastika, could you imagine instead of a hexagon, there's a swastika on top of Jupiter.

Speaker 3:          00:49:20       Jesus Christ you think is really take at Jupiter was a Saturday. Was it Saturday? Jupiter might've been saturn there, but there was some very bizarre pattern pattern. That's a very strange. Yeah. But it. And it's uniform. I mean it's like pretty close to an actual hexagon. I believe so yeah, it, it is very weird that we get so wrapped up in symbols and symbols are so huge for us. But they are efficient compressions and information. So you know, and then you lose, you know, assemble like you can lose the name. I'm like, Dick, nobody's calling a kid's Dick was gay, right? Get it used to be gay old time. The flintstones, they had a gay old time. That was one of the last uses of gay in that my grandfather claimed that the emotion of gaiety was lost with the word. He claimed that there was actually an emotion that went with it, but no one actually experiences anymore. Wow. Um, but how does he describe it? That it was a sort of a careless frivolity

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       that had, had a certain, sort of a combination of like innocence tinge with a little bit of a mischief like sexual mischief really. Anyway, you know, so we become aware of words that opened up new territory. So like the concept of Synack, uh, in Thai and lots of people go through Thailand come back and they need the words and look, which is the quality of fun that something has to have in order for it to be worth doing. Like, did you pay your electrical bill? Know why there was no snuck in it, you know, so that, that was like, that's a concept or Chutzpah, you know, coming from Yiddish or Turkish has Yakka Mo's, which is the trail of light left on the water by the moon. Right? And so once you have a word for Yakima was, it's very hard not to use it even though nobody in English speaking context knows about it. Just the way the word Selfie, uh, if you recall when that came in, we'd seen all these weird pictures of like ladies and you know, uh, restrooms taking pictures of themselves in the mirror and you're like, what the hell is that? Somebody says, oh, that's a selfie. And I was like, got it. Right. And then suddenly that word was everywhere. So once we get the symbolic compression that goes with a concept,

Speaker 1:          00:51:53       we become pretty dangerous. My wife has a friend and so stupid, she has no one a selfie means. So she takes, she uses Hashtag selfie and somebody else takes the picture. Yeah. The nature of her, she doesn't have a fucking camera in her hand and she's standing there with their hands on her hips. I would love to joke with you. I have definitely used that Hashtag selfie. I've thought Selfie when it's not a Selfie at all. Well, I mean it was just her picture of herself. Maybe she set up the camera. Maybe I'm the Asshole, right? Isn't it? Is it a selfie? If you put a timer on a camera and he stepped back and will fuck me. I'm an asshole. He's a talmudic questions of our right. I'm wrong. Maybe she's got a. maybe if you just have a husband that's so dominant, just sit around and take pictures of you so you can put them on instagram.

Speaker 1:          00:52:39       I mean, you, you basically programmed itself. You have a program monkey that'll take pictures. It's extend itself. Exactly. Yeah. If you, uh, if you shoot a pheasant and you have a dog that will fetch that bird and bring it back to you, you still shot the bird a pheasant? Yeah. Yeah. Do you know how they do that? Yeah. Yeah. You, you flushed the birds out with dogs, the birds go up in the air, they shoot them out with a shotgun, the birds hit the ground, the dog gets it and brings it back to you. But you shot it. Yeah. Yeah. That's why they only call them retrievers and things. Yes, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. But we're learning a lot of shit. Let's, let's just go over all we covered.

Speaker 1:          00:53:18       No, no quiz, but we recovered why we're moving because there's a fucking earthquake going on on the roof. Um, Indian music, a cephalopods sneaker males, sneaker sneaker males. Yeah. I didn't know so many things I didn't know about. It's not like a common thing though, like everybody kind of knows that's what a lot of male feminists are there. Like, like sneaker males, they like sliding in closer proximity to the females by, you know, by trying to sort of as pals some ideals that they think would be more attractive to the females because they don't find them in nature. Yeah. And then the problem is that the ambulatory window comes along and suddenly there's a desire for something completely different and they go out with some biker right? Immediately it was like, what happened with that? It's like, I don't know. It was strangely appealing. Yeah, it's that fucking gene poll, man, the Goddamn genetics they've got us put.

Speaker 1:          00:54:14       It is really amazing how we're conscious and we're, we're aware of all these issues that we deal with, but yet we're still, we're still at the firm to a certain extent at the whim of these genes, of these, these poles that we have inside of us. That's like the argument that people always make for why some people find like subsistence living, like those shows in Alaska. So oddly comforting you ever see those shows is you're really close with the environment that brought you here. Yeah. Like Alaska, the final frontier. You see that show notes, folks just live up in there. They're actually related to that woman jewel. Do you know that beautiful singer jewel? Remember some amazing voice and uh, she is related to those folks that live in Alaska and they have this show where they live mean they live way the fuck up there with nobody around them.

Speaker 1:          00:55:09       They are literally in just bumfuck nowhere, Alaska to do that. But it's oddly comforting. I'd love those shows. I don't know why I love those shows. What really do I think you might. I could see you doing that, delivered like that. Nah. Nah, I'd like to do it in little bursts. Yeah. I enjoy a movie theater, sir. I like a highway. I like to drive cars. I, uh, I enjoy television. I like cooking in a home. I liked doing that. I like sitting down with electricity. I like all the trappings of civilization, but I do enjoy going to nature. I have no desire to be a trapper and fucking, you know, flying around in a Bush plane, landing places and checking my steel traps for minx and stuff. Yeah. Those are the folks. Is that her in there? Obviously. Super Old picture of it. Is she one of them? Is she the girl with the red sweater? Yeah, probably I forget the name of the family killed. Killed. Sure. Yeah, I think that is it. Yeah, but I mean these fucking people, they make their own houses up there. I like that. And somehow or another she escaped. She probably lives in Venice now. Some shit. My Arch Nemesis is this guy, Garrett Lee see lives in Maui. Oh yeah. Why you guys?

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       Arch Nemesis is you don't have one. Uh, I don't think so. You should totally get one. What are they good for you? Well, first of all, lots of billionaires for cotton to have an arch nemesis. You go to movies about arch nemeses. I don't know what the plural is, but it's like, it's definitely one of these things almost nobody has. And your arch nemesis has to be somewhat like you. So you know, like there is tension that there should only be one. Oh yeah. See, I'm not an, there should only be one guy. I'm a tribal guy. I think you should gather up as many people that are like you and support each other. Well, you do end up supporting your economics that you keep each other going. Oh right. And it's some sort of a way, right? Yeah, yeah, I mean definitely. We definitely need some sort of competition.

Speaker 3:          00:57:04       I definitely believe that. So my, my arch nemesis took me out into the jungles of northern Mali. Kill you. I thought so really? We wonder if you have an enemy. And he says, Hey man, you want to go hiking? Like, fuck bro. Well, I was, I was down for it because I just thought, look, I'm not sure that he's the one is coming back. Right, right. Yeah. Anyway, we're on this trail and um, we're visiting this phd mathematician in the jungles. It is without question the most mosquito ridden place I've ever been. Yeah. It's just, it's unlivable now. He has some incredible rainforest. Incredible. And we get out along this trail hike like a mile or two in and this guy has built Shangrila. He's taken this river and he's, you know, he's been there for like 25, 30, 40 years and he's, he's like a phd in differential geometry.

Speaker 3:          00:58:00       Wow. He like lives into this amazing jury in tree fruit Durian. Is that. Yeah, that's that stinky fruit. Right. Why would he do that? Because if you've ever had great, and it's one of the great pleasures of life really? Oh God. So it stinks, but it tastes good. Yeah. It's like limburger cheese. Oh, okay. That's a good analysis. So anyway, this guy has built this solitary world that nobody is watching, like it's a performance for one and it's like this naturally sculpted wonderland that he lives in with all these mosquitoes that he doesn't notice under his diary entries where you can do mathematics. Why does he not notice him? Has. Because you've been there for 30. Yeah. Wow. I mean you can't. You can't focus on that for 30 years. He needs to get one of those. A thermo sells. You ever seen those things? Oh, they're amazing. Yeah. If you go to anywhere where the mosquitoes are particularly aggressive because like if you go to a Alaska, if you've been to Alaska before, sir, one thing about Alaska that's fantastic is the mosquitoes are fucking rabid. They are like pit polls. Me and my friend Ari went fishing in Alaska and I am not exaggerating. No, we didn't. We, we spread ourselves up with fucking horrible chemicals that probably took a year off my life, but when you step out of the car, I

Speaker 6:          00:59:21       mean when we opened up, look at that, that's like legitimately what it's like. We opened up the door to the car and within three to five seconds there was 100 mosquitoes inside the car. It's fucking insane because they're only alive for like a month, right? It's only warm enough for them to exist for a short period of time, so they're insanely aggressive. So anyway, there's this product called thermacell that outdoors people use and what it is is it's like a small pad that looks like a large square, like piece of gum or something like that, and you slide this blue pad under this screen and then you ignite it by pressing a button. This little heating element goes off and it has like a little fuel canister that keeps this very tiny fire. It's immensely small. You have to look into see if it's lit right. It's probably not even a fire.

Speaker 6:          01:00:13       It's like somehow or another element is heating up this fuel. It takes a long time to go through a small canister, but it emits this very fine mist and this missed. We'll keep a like an 18 square foot, get out window of protection from Ms Dot. Dude. It is impossible to be in the outdoors with it without it rather once you've had it. It's, I, I, I've found out about it from a, um, my friends in Alberta, they, uh, they were, the first turned me on about it. They live in Alberta and the same thing in Alberta that mosquitoes are super, super aggressive because it's only warm enough for them to exist for short period of time. I'm so glad I did the show. Dude. Thermacell is amazing and you can strap them to your hip. You just put one on right there and you don't even smell it.

Speaker 6:          01:00:55       And the mosquitoes don't want to have nothing to do with it. They just keep them. They try some, like really aggressive ones. Go, you motherfucker. I'm gonna give up. I mean, it's amazing. It makes a, being in the woods incredibly bearable. Like a meet. My daughters wanted to go camping in the back yard one night. There was bugs out there and I said, Oh, I've got the solution now. When I got my thermacell, let that sucker put it there. Everybody's a alcohol sleeping. Just no problems at all. Bugs and civilians can purchase this. Yeah, well it's not. It's not toxic, but it's super easy to use. That's it right there. Yeah, so that. Thanks to that blue thing in the top. That's a piece of the thermacell, the chewing gum looking stuff. These slide under that screen and when it gets used up, that blue thing becomes all white.

Speaker 6:          01:01:41       It's so easy to use mat. Go to like, come check it. Just to say that they have a large one there that looks like a lamp. See that one? That looks like a lamp up there. Fucking dude. Those things are the shit. I hate mosquitoes. Oh thermacell. So way to go. I mean I don't look google the negative consequences. You see that? See that one? He's got like pouches on the side of the container and one pound she would have like your little extra fuel canisters and the other side. You'd probably have some of those little extra thermacell paths, but one little thing, one of those little blue things last for like eight hours. So I mean one of the great questions is some of the most beautiful land,

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       uh, in a place like Maui is mosquito ridden. And so if some, if that worked, could you change the land value? You'd have to burn them all the time and I don't know if it's something you want to breathe in all the time and I just don't, I don't know enough about negative consequences but I've used them a bunch of times and they've never even given me a headache or anything. Find out if whatever's in thermacell is like safe for long term exposure is you're not supposed to use in a confined space. Oh, okay. Because there is some sort of stuff you're obviously breathing in for sure, but permanent permit then than parent within. I don't know how come. Nothing. You know, I've asked this before, but when we were kids and you read comic books, but like radiation, they always helped people turn people into fucking superheroes.

Speaker 1:          01:03:05       Yeah. You never hear that shit in real life. You have to get lucky and get some hobby attic mutations. So you've got like straight arms coming out of your head and never does anything good. No, no mutations in bugs. They're really cool. Well, yeah, and bugs that I mean in, in human beings like I mean I guess or the Chinese experimented with that probably. That was the thing about crispr that I was going to bring up earlier for sure. They're doing that right? They're making humans. Yeah, I mean that's the thing about like having this ethical moral stance on the use of something like crisper to genetically alter fetus that if you do that, you've really. If, if you have an opposition to altering embryos, that's immoral. It's not something we want to be a part of. Yeah, but that's the problem. They already passed that.

Speaker 1:          01:03:56       The Russians don't give a fuck about that. Did you see that movie? I'm a ICARUS. No, God damn. You have to see that movie, right sir? Um, I had Bryan Fogel on last week who is the director and producer of this documentary on the doping, the Russian state sponsored doping program. Russians don't play dude. They don't play. They had a state sponsored doping program that was kind of overseen by, by Putin, like down the line, like there's a direct chain of command and the whole entire Russian team is so cheap was on drugs. All of them. The Guy who engineered the whole thing, like the main scientist is in the United States now under protective custody in hiding. And Putin is trying to drag them back to Russia by stealing the homes from his family, stealing his wives home, turned him into homeless people in some sort of a lure to get him to sacrifice himself to come back for the health and safety of his family. Do you remember what happened when? Sit down that it didn't work out so good. The cell phone video, that's when you know you fucked up cell phone. Video footage of your execution. Oh, that's that. Saddam's execution. But I think he learned his son and his son in laws back, like, don't worry, it's all forgiven than the southern Illinois came back and then. Oh really? It was the, it was pretty skilled in, uh, in. Oh, this

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       was a different situation then I thought, no, no, no, no. The self. I mean, even though that was a very strange situation because he actually was the only guy was like, he had his shit together when he was being executed. He understood the game. He accepted the gap. So I got it right. But also he's probably like, Jesus Christ. How many people did I kill? I got the, I think after you've killed like a few hundred thousand people, you probably like, I probably deserve it. Yeah. I'm, I'm, well, I know you've ever seen a Christopher hitchens. I'm narrating the original bath party. Um, don't know. I don't know what to call it. Theatrical video where like half the bath party was called out as being revealed traders. And then the other half of the bath party was giving, given side arms with which to execute them, making them complicit in the founding murder.

Speaker 2:          01:06:07       And there was all filmed, oh, I'm aware of this, but I didn't know that Christopher hitchens narrated it. Well, he did something where he, he brought it to prominence, right? I think I was aware of it with just Arabic and I couldn't tell what was going on. And then he actually said, okay, look, you have to appreciate. Well, this is a topic that I think would be good to talk about. I don't know that I've ever talked about it, but message violence is the glue that keeps a lot of societies together and we don't study it or talk about violence that is specifically constructed to be theatrical. I'm like public beheadings. Yeah. Um, that would be it kind of message violence, um, um, or for example, forcing families to pay for the ammunition with which their family members were executed to make them complicit and emphasize their weakness.

Speaker 2:          01:07:09       Um, all of the stuff that the mind goes to horror movies to explore, uh, is often used structurally, uh, particularly in the Middle East. Um, so, you know, Isis, for example, the Jordanian pilot video, which I find that many people haven't seen, the whole point of it was that the pilots were raining down, death into particular forms, rubble and fire when people in the ground and isis captured one of the Jordanian pilots and decided that they would theatrically execute him with a version of exactly these two things, um, that he was meeting out from the air. And so the whole point of it was to create the cinematic imagery, um, to sear into people's mind what it meant to oppose isis that isis was in fact just in a sort of eye for an eye kind of way. And, um, you know, my belief is, is that we don't understand

Speaker 6:          01:08:16       the role that message violence plays in part because we are now denying it. If you think about Vietnam, we have all of these images that were burned into all of our minds. I'm with Pulitzer Prize winning photographs. But in the modern era, you don't have images like that from Iraq because there was a, there was a decision that we could not afford in some sense, to have the kind of opposition that we had to Vietnam when people suddenly said, wait, wait a minute, you're doing what in my name. There's a, there's an issue that has always puzzled me. And this issue is people that lean left, people that consider themselves progressives have a very distinct, very obvious bias against criticizing Islam, criticizing Islamic terrorism, criticizing a Islamic suppression of women. You know, that these criticizing these cultures, uh, under the guise of not wanting to promote Islamophobia and things on those lines.

Speaker 6:          01:09:21       And I've always wondered how much of what that is, is a fear of reprisal, of speaking out against them is terrifying. So what they do instead is embraced the cultural differences that these people exhibit concentrate instead on the positive aspects of their community. And the good things about Muslim culture and Islamic culture and not really does not bring it up at all. Like you very rarely hear people on the left talk about how oppressive and horrific some of the conditions that women and homosexuals are forced to live in, in, in, in Muslim cultures. Right. And I've always wondered if that's what that is. Like there's a fee because no one in modern day and no one ideology is more brutal in there reprisal. I mean they kill apostates, right? They killed people who leave. If you join, you can join. No one's stopping them. They're all.

Speaker 6:          01:10:18       The whole idea of spreading Islam is that you should be proselytizing. You should be getting people to join because it is the only truth is the only way to go. But once you do join the urine like you, you're not allowed to leave. First of all, let's actually do this one. I think it's important, but they didn't start that. We Jews started this so far as I know. So if you go. No, no, no, no. We don't. We don't proselytize, but the. Once you're in, you're in a really? Yeah. If you go to deuteronomy, I think it says something to the effect of if someone comes to you and says, Hey, let's worship God's not known to the father's a set upon them with the stone before anyone else gets there, but are you supposed to do that to someone who is already converted to? If you're in, if you're in, you're in and somebody says, Hey, let's go worship other gods. You're supposed to kill them, but what if that was so interesting? Like, so it's

Speaker 1:          01:11:13       an old idea. It's an old idea and it's not an Islamic idea. It's a Jewish idea in my opinion. Okay. But it does exist today, primarily. So I asked my rabbi about this and she did. She said, you have a female rabbi, you progressive motherfucker, you will look at, you know, I have. I actually, I like it. I'm proud of this. I have a rabbi who happens to be female born female or was it one of them? She's all woman. All rabbi allegedly. They're all women. Caitlyn Jenner's all incendiary topics. Do you want. No, no, no. Let's just turn everything up to 11. Come on, man. I'm a comedian, right? Have a boss in three minutes. I'm about to be a target. Oh, okay. You're a no targeting female rabbi. So her point was, yeah. And we don't execute anybody. Um, because in ineffective, that portion of the code never runs.

Speaker 1:          01:12:10       So the Jews have figured out how to have bad code that is almost permanently inoperative. Hmm. If I could stop you there for a second. One of the unique things about Jews is that there are so many Jewish people that I know that it's still considered themselves Jewish but are almost totally atheist. Yeah. Like my friend Ari, like he was doing this video recently where this podcast recently and was, we were doing this challenge where we can't drink or smoke pot or do anything for a month and we have to do 15 hot yoga classes and he's going crazy and screaming during his podcast. I am a Jewish performer and I live in New York City. I'm supposed to be doing drugs. I was supposed to be drinking. I liked drinking. Um, but he's, he's the biggest atheist I've ever met in my life, or if not an atheist, he certainly at the very least agnostic at the very least.

Speaker 1:          01:13:04       He's definitely not as someone who considers himself a religious person, but he was, yeah, he wasn't. He escaped the clause of it when he was young. But it's Jews many times think of himself, it's almost a tribe as much as it is a religion. Like if you, you sit down and corner. Most Jews that I know about, like how much of the Talmud do you follow? How much? How much of the Old Testament do you think is legit? How much of the, the, these, these teachings do you think are imperative for everyday living is. It was the vast majority don't want to have they, they're not connected to any of it. If you're following the Old Testament, you wouldn't recognize him as a Jew. Right? Right. We have to kill the apostates. I used to live in an ultra Orthodox neighborhood in Jerusalem and at some point I was writing on the Sabbath, my final list for leaving and the kids in the building next door started shouting in Hebrew. It is forbidden to write on the Sabbath, kill him. Whoa. And the parents had to kind of knock it off like the ultra orthodox parents. So they wanted to kill you because you were writing because it was

Speaker 3:          01:14:11       literally that, that was, I was violated on a bunch of little monsters. Now moms are, is the word you're looking bastards. Anyway. Yeah. So Jews are big into observance, but part of the relationship is you get to question things that are much deeper level than in most religions. And you know, I would say six or seven rabbis well enough to ask the question about their belief structure. None of them believe in the character of God from the Old Testament. So how do they sort of rationalized the whole thing? Well, that's the whole point is you have layers of abstraction and um, you know, if you're really stupid, for example, do you believe that the supreme court is a nine black robed a super geniuses who can channel the original intent of the founding fathers? I think they're wizards. Yeah. Okay. Just like wizard. Well then then that sounds it. I mean, you, you, you, there's a grownup way of loving your country and there's a childish way of loving your country and there's a grownup way of believing in your religion and the childish childish one is like, yeah, it's all literally. But what is the grown up way of believing in a religion?

Speaker 3:          01:15:28       Well, I mean, in part, and it's got a lot of hidden instructions. It's, it's not resolved so that you have these sort of dialectical tensions that a sea of like ethical guidelines as opposed to like, yeah, that's not telling you exactly what, down from on high and giant stone tablets, well, you know, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not kill has to go up against an admission to kill. Right. And so these things are not resolved in there,

Speaker 3:          01:15:59       but I'm trying to swim back upstream to your original point about Islam. We're going to get waylaid here. Will you leave Israel or Jews particularly? There is an answer to this and I used to know it, but I forgot it. What is the reason why so many European Jews have won Nobel prizes? So many European Jews are insanely intelligent. Like what is the modern social justice answer? It's because we cheated physics. Want you that answer? That's a joke. That's a silly answer. No, no, no, no. They're fucking smart. Like why? Why are so many insanely intelligent people? European Jews. So you. Is it hard for you to answer being a Jew? Yeah. A little bit. Like if you asked me about, uh, well let, let, let's do a different one. Okay. Okay. So from 18, 97 and 1987, you had all of these different countries winning the Boston marathon. Then from 1987 to the president basically to Kenya and Ethiopia, maybe a Korean guy wins it or something. Why is that? Well,

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       now you have this really uncomfortable thing which is, uh, is it culture? Is it that those guys in east Africa just have heart? Is it because they really run to, to school everyday? Twenty six miles. People said that and then turns out they take the bus like everybody else. So there can be a genetic predisposition in tradeoffs space. There can be a cultural premium. So, uh, when you have the top marriage prospects, do you marry them off to the, to the richest or the smartest? So in Judaism there is some weird way in which intellectual prestige proxies for, um, material wealth. So if you have somebody who's insanely smart, not very rich, it can be very prestigious to marry your, uh, your daughter, let's say to that a student of the tour. So there are all sorts of cultural strange aspects of this. Is it because money lending was prescribed and forbidden to Christians that this particular facility with mathematics was highly selected for when nobody else was selecting for it?

Speaker 2:          01:18:22       You know, I don't know what the answer is, but I do know that I'm like, in my case, getting a phd in mathematics using an Ivy league education for that, or in my brother's case, giving up an ivy league education to make a point. I'm standing up for social justice. These are sort of self destructive things in most cultures. Standing up for social justice against social justice warriors. We, in his case, he stood up because a Jewish fraternity was using black strippers for sexual entertainment to a lure in a incoming freshman. And he said, okay, this is, you know, this is some sort of class oriented thing where we're exploiting one. This is a different situation. No, no, no, no. Yeah. So he had, he had to leave Penn, university of Pennsylvania under death threats. Um, wow. So, you know, this is the great irony of my brother's situation is that for people who don't know who your brother, Bret Weinstein, yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:19:23       Is a Weinstein. Harvey Weinstein. Bret Weinstein, right? I'm Brett, was the guy that was the part of the whole Evergreen college fiasco. He's been on this podcast twice. I suggest if you're interested, you could either google his name and get the story from a multitude of sources or listen to the original podcast where he sort of laid it out. It was before the settlement with the college before he wound up leaving and you know, I really hope that he goes the Jordan Peterson route, meaning that he starts putting up these lectures and some of these ideas that he has just putting them up on online. It just putting videos up and patriot. I know he's got a patriot on page now, correct? Yep. And that. Which is a great way to do it too. But

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       Jordan is making more money from doing that than he ever did. From College. Yeah. For Teaching University. I want to support. You know, the other thing is, is that we have to make the case because he can't because it'll look wrong. Right. Hire this motherfucker that motherfucker. Yeah. I mean he's amazing. He's a straight up genius. I have a recommendation for him from his old advisor who I think he said he's the top student in 40 years of advising and just we have to recognize that if you want this stuff to stop, you have to make it not pay to drive super smart people who are courageous enough to be open in their thinking and just shared. I'm sorry. Keep going. Yeah. Um, and to share and to share their thoughts. And fundamentally, if we drive these people to extinction, it's on us. And so my question is, hey, University of Chicago, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, where are you?

Speaker 3:          01:21:04       Yeah. I mean, some people are terrified of repercussions, but they think that he's a. he's a guy from evergreen state, so he's lower rank. Let me, let me use my tiny megaphone to say he's not lower rank. He's unfucking believably smart. Look at his work on Elongate of telomeres in laboratory animals where he predicted what Nobel laureate Carol Greider found from first principles that the mice that are being used to test our drugs have wildly exaggerated telomere lengths. Giving them amazing capacities for histological repair, but pop possibly putting drugs to market that shouldn't be there. This is somebody you want to be taking intellectually serious and stop treating this like the clown act that they're running and this just happens to be a victim. Well, Evergreen college is an amazing example of what can go wrong if you let these crazy children sort of dictate the way human beings are allowed to behave and the way discourse takes place on campus to the cliff notes what I was going to say, they wanted to have a day of absence.

Speaker 3:          01:22:13       They've added traditionally had a day of absence where people of color would take the day off to school for where people would miss them. Sort of like, didn't they engineer that in La, David Without Mexicans who was a movie, right? It would shut down. We'll just tell you right now. LS shuts down without Mexicans, but too, but instead of doing that, the social justice warrior mentality that thinks that every white man is some sort of an oppressor and you need to figure out a way to eradicate them from the world. They decided to go the opposite route and force white staff and white students to stay home. Your brother rightly protested saying that is inherently racist. Like what you're proposing is is an anti racist? Yes, he's anti. The problem is that the diversity movement which has now become the equity movement, is actually racist, racist against white people. It's, I mean, I don't even want to say it's reverse racism and racism against white.

Speaker 2:          01:23:05       It's openly racist. Reverse either racism or not racism. That whole proposal, that racism against white people is reverse race. Now this is a cult and the way you know that it's a cult is you ask for the definition of racism and if somebody tells you it's power plus prejudice and therefore certain groups can't be racist because they have no power. That's how you know somebody in the cult because if you look it up in the dictionary, it doesn't say anything like that. Another one would be a gender has nothing to do with sex. Go to the Oxford English dictionary. Look at the difference between three versus three. Be a gender and sex have been closely tied and sometime like in the 19 forties, a couple of fields in the US started using gender to be behavior sex to be that which is your dedicated genotype phenotype.

Speaker 2:          01:23:59       What what is going on is is that these people are changing the definition of words in order to push a cult into the exact place where it must not go. It must not go in the diversity office. It must not go in hr. You cannot have this openly racist, openly sexist cult in the place where the which is the immune system, and so that's. That's. That's the key thing is that we're used to thinking of our immune system is being there to protect us, but if you think about an auto immune disease, it's when your immune system starts attacking the self that you're in real trouble. So learn the signs and learn the tells. You don't have to sign up for Jordan Peterson's postmodernism. Just ask somebody whether black people can be racist against whites and as soon as you hear power plus prejudice, you know you're talking to a cult member.

Speaker 2:          01:24:51       As soon as you hear the gender and sex have nothing to do with each other, right? And you have recourse to dictionaries and you start talking about the history and somebody starts, well, that's your white fragility. That's your white privilege. Why are you in denial? Why aren't you accepting allyship? So suddenly it's like, okay, it's Xenu in the volcanoes and the clams. Again, it is. Yeah, it is. And um, well one, one great piece of evidence about that was this whole google memo thing, that Google memo thing, the difference between what that guy actually wrote on the memo and what was published in so many different publications. So many different online websites. It's just straight up libelous like that guy, if I mean I know he's going to sue google, but he's. He could probably sue a host of people once he's done with that because they changed what he wrote and turned him into this horrible evil, sexist person to the point where the CEO of Google have a youtube rather was saying that she.

Speaker 2:          01:25:48       She read it and it made her sad at the whole thing, made her sad. Well, he wrote up a piece based on why people of different genders are more inclined to gravitate toward specific things. You made an error how, what was the error? The error that he made was, is that he used a reserved term neuroticism, the big five personality inventory where it is a reserved term denoting a particular psychometric and so rather than saying men are less conscientious than women, women are more neurotic, women are more neurotic. I actually brought that up with him and he regretted it. He regretted bringing that because I told them. I said that's my only criticism is like that's a derogatory term, but again, I'm not quite remembered that the big five personality inventory, you know, his openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. But you know, when you see something that careful, I mean most people just didn't read it.

Speaker 2:          01:26:44       They went with the headline. So that's the first thing you should guess somebody that's smart is probably using a term, if I say moral hazard to you and you don't know economics, you're going to think, oh wow, what is the moral hazard? Is that like reefer has nothing to do with that. It's a reserved term, right? So if I keep talking about rent seeking or moral hazard, and I'm talking about landlords, you know, or somebody offering your kid a Doobie afterschool, right, right, right. So, so that was like the first intellectual failure. I and I, I just have been dealing with this with or I talk about power laws and statistics, which is a particular type of probability distribution. And somebody says, Geez, the power powerful people in our country are so protected and privileged. Why are we, why do we need laws to protect them?

Speaker 2:          01:27:26       Like what? Oh, you said power law. It's like that has nothing to do with the. There used to be this character on Saturday night live, whose name was emily Latella, played by Gilda radner and they bring her in and she was hard of hearing. Say, what's this? I hear about a death penalty. The death have problems enough as it is, and then she'd riff for two minutes and the death penalty. It's like, oh, that's entirely different. Nevermind. So she was trying to remember like violins on television. Can you read classical music? Kitchen random was awesome. She was awesome. Zana, Rosanna Danna. Oh my God. You couldn't do any of this stuff anymore. You couldn't. You really couldn't. But I'm getting back to the demore thing. I'm just checking our tree and it's exploding here. You know the thing about what he did was he was trying to write a pro diversity memo.

Speaker 2:          01:28:18       If you lie about the differences between men and women, what are your odds that you will be able to hack a solution to get getting all the brilliant women? In our country who care about stem into the workforce, this is what we need to do. There's no shortage of brilliant women know I've collaborated with them. I know they're there. We need to figure out as a society do we need to pay women more so that we can get them out of working in the home and taking care of older parents and young children during their prime years. We need to be very creative about the actual differences between men and women. Should we have a rule not equal pay for equal work, but equal pay for unequal salary negotiation if we don't allow ourselves, but please, please elaborate on that because that is an issue with why women sometimes make less than men, is that they don't have the same sort of aggressive salary negotiating tendencies that a lot of men do.

Speaker 2:          01:29:13       Aggressive testosterone driven, sort of. I mean, there's all sorts of things. You know, again, I don't want to mansplain any. That's not a big issue too. I mean, look at Chekhov. Short story called the Nincompoop in which an employer and a domestic worker in his home and he talks to her about all of her wages and then he starts taking away little bit by little bit for, you know, you broke a cup and you were a little bit late and he whittles her compensation down to nothing and she accepts it. And then he says, the employer says, you, you stupid fool. I've just cheated you out of your entire wages. I'm going to give them to you, but understand that this is how an employer cheats and employee and you're just like, whoa. So this is, uh, an old Russian speaking a truth, which is don't allow yourself to get taken advantage of.

Speaker 2:          01:30:05       Now you could say that's really horrible because it's called the Nincompoop, right? Or You could say, actually that was an attempt to talk about a problem about needing to be more aggressive and more assertive. So getting back to the Demora issue, demore needed to set this thing up at Google differently. So I took my son to the local pinball arcade and just think of it as a bunch of workstations where nobody's getting paid. Instead you're paying for the privilege of staring at this thing for hours with the bells and lights, doing something with balls and mechanical systems. There are no. They're not a lot of women trying to integrate the pinball arcade because it's a loser activity. Right? That's how they see us for losers. I play pinball. I'm a loser. I know these things. Okay. Now my owns a pinball arcade, was kind of restaurant pinball and the second to hurt me.

Speaker 2:          01:31:04       No, I'm just joking. The point is this is something which has low prestige. It's anti compensated and compensated. Good. Could we appointing right? It's just like you're just plugging the money into the machines. So my point is is that what you said was it's not cognitive ability. You Idiots. It's interest in temperament, which is hugely liberating, right? If it's not basically cognitive ability. If men are as smart as women, but men can do something for hours and hours often uncompensated in a kind of robotic monomaniacal tunnel focus kind of a way. Is that necessarily a great thing but happens to be compensated now? It's only a great thing if that's what you choose to go into for a career. I don't. I program and I hate it. I'm not programming. What do you want to do? Play

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       that funky Indian violent thing. Exactly. But I'll spend hours doing something like that. Right, but the point is is that coding turns me into like this autistic spectrum. He guy. I get speech APP apnea. Again, I don't want to say anything against. The more you get into coding, you just sort of adopt a code mine, so he started talking to me while I'm coding. Right. You say, Hey Eric, do you want to go out for a beer? I'll start say

Speaker 7:          01:32:30       maybe

Speaker 3:          01:32:30       later. Yeah. What I'm doing is I'm being annoying and I'm distracting you from your. Exactly. Right. Right. I see you as annoying. Yes. I'm. I'm trying to follow something as annoying too, if that helps. Well, if it's, if you're doing Brazilian Jujitsu and I come in and say, hey joe, you want to go out for a beer? Like I got my hands full choked, bro. Yeah, yeah. So you know, the. The issue is that a lot of us, you know, who have male hardware, male software, recognize that we get obsessive compulsive. We're not always thinking about reward. Right. It's not necessarily the most attractive set of characteristics. When I do math, I'm definitely wildly on the spectrum and I'm proud by the way, I'm proud of it. It's not like it's not a derogatory term. And you're actually talking about yourself when I'm socializing. Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:33:22       I'd like to think that I'm fairly normal, normal, fairly normal, but when I'm doing math, yeah, I don't want to be right. I want, I want to kill that problem. I want to think through that thing. I want to have that theorem. I'm not on the spectrum in any way, but I'm that way with writing for sure. If I'm writing and someone came over to talk to me and be like, ah, I can't talk, you know, I'm in my own. My wife will come over and she'll say, wow, you're really sharp with me. Huh? What? I barely even noticed that you were. Oh, she's needy. No, but the thing is, is that we've collaborated on. She brought a geometry from quantum field theory into economics and so at the level of, you know, she, she's really, she occupies brain space with me, but she will kick out of that space if the kids need something.

Speaker 3:          01:34:14       Whereas I'll just say, I'm sure the kids will be fine. Just, you know, they're two years old, Eric, you know, they're, they're not going to be able to take care of themselves, you know, and, and so she'll have a much more. She always has her compassion running. Whereas I can turn it off, turn it on for periods of time when I'm focused. There are these differences and you know, I think we need to impart to teach women how to under deliver under deliver. Yeah. How so? Well, if you can't risk underdelivering then you can't shoot for the, you know, you can't swing for the fences as often. You want to make sure that you're going to be able to not disappoint. Some men very often like, hey, I thought I could do it. Didn't quite work out. It's going to take another couple of weeks.

Speaker 3:          01:34:59       That's a weird way of putting it though, because that's a results oriented way of putting them instead of an ambition oriented. This is what I'm trying to say. Like if the real secret of life is over, promise over deliver, I don't think it is though, some that it is assumed that you were in a bid. If somebody else is going to promise more than you, and then if you can't overdeliver, given that you've already over promised, then you can't actually delight people so that they're going to want to do multiple, uh, go rounds with economy of bullshit though. Like, do we really want even promote that? Like why not just why, why not? Just be honest about what you can do because you don't know what you can do. You know, this is the thing that I will be honest about what you think you can do.

Speaker 3:          01:35:43       No, no. Okay. Well, let's use it in a practical sense like so. So this was the whole Watson to bring you a car and I say, hey man, I think the transmission's gone on his fucking thing. Do you not a fixed one of those things and you're like, definitely, I know how to do it. I can do it. But meanwhile you don't write well I don't want to go to you man. Well I'll go to the guy down the street, but you've given it to them for 25 years. He's given me the car right now. I go home. I said, you know what I'm doing? I'm trying to open this thing. I don't know, right? I better learn transmissions fast. Right? So now I go into crazy mode because now I'm terrified. This is called crossing the adaptive value. What if it's something you can't learn fast, like Brazilian Jujitsu?

Speaker 3:          01:36:25       Look, what if I come to you and I say, Hey, are you a Jujitsu expert, Eric? And you're like, yes I am. I'm like, okay, cool. Why don't you meet me in two weeks and we're going to do Jujitsu and you have two weeks to go fucking crazy and learn all, you know about Jujitsu. So what we're talking about now is this is not a trivial skill and transmissions is. No, let's slow it down. Okay? You have to be able to have a feel for what adaptive valleys you can cross. Okay? I see what you're saying. So in other words, if you just say like, Hey, I could run this country country, uh, I run businesses, then you're going to have a problem because you really have to learn Washington in order to run it. Right? And if you have no plan to do that, then you're just bullshitting your way through everything.

Speaker 3:          01:37:20       Like hypothetically. Yeah, like this hypothetical situation hypothetically now. But my point is that there are lots of things that don't have those characteristics were um, something is really hard, but you may have to invent something in order to get out of it. So there's, you know, dumb enough to get in smart enough to get out is kind of the magic formula. Hm. Bite off more than you can chew, but if you actually, you know, feel cold, you can summon the will, you can summon the intellect, you can summon your friends, your resources to somehow get across the adaptive value, but isn't it a problem that it leaves open? The possibility won't be able to get across that valley. We just put someone who is an expert in the field and who's worked very hard through apprenticeship, through schooling, whatever it is to get to become an expert in this field can tell you definitively, yes, Eric, I can fix your computer.

Speaker 3:          01:38:17       I've fixed computers for a living. I know exactly how to attach a motherboard to let's at least agree that you're making the point that you know don't over promise and under deliver. Yes, but we all know that. We all know that. We all know that. That's the general good advice. So, but you're advising women to do something that they shouldn't. But here's the problem. I'm trying to give advice. The more women that over promise and under deliver, the more people are going to go, you know, what are these chicks? Because they don't deliver. I don't think that that's right. You don't think. I think that what's happening is, is that there are certain characteristics that are very valuable in low variance processes. There are certain things that you want every time to work out. Okay. Right. Well, child, child rearing or particular kinds of surgery. Yes. Right. It's a simple APP and a appendectomy. I, I don't want to get fancy, just do the APP and an appendectomy and don't screw it up. Right. Okay. Okay. So those are low variance processes. Now you've got some sort of crazy conjoined twins that nobody's ever seen before.

Speaker 3:          01:39:26       Right. And the question is what are we going to do? Right. Well, do you think that that is potentially within your ability, even though nobody's ever successfully pulled it off before you have to over promise to some extent. Like there's a guy who's going to try to do a head transplant, you know, we, we had somebody who, a head transplant with monkeys in the early seventies, Robert White or something. Yeah. So, you know, this came out of um, Jim Watson said this thing, which I think is just brilliant, which is if you're going to do something amazing, you are by definition unqualified to do it. That's Watson and Crick and Watson. That's right. Now the point was is that those guys did not know enough biochemistry to do the Double Helix, but why do you think that that's good advice to give to women to overprice over promise. I understand that, okay. If you cannot over promise, you may not be able to win a bidding war for the right to do a project. If you're playing it very, very safe and other people are saying, yeah, I can get that done faster and cheaper. See, the cynic in me says you're telling people to bullshit.

Speaker 3:          01:40:43       I like Bill Gates. I'd like to know whether or not someone can actually deliver on what we're talking about. When Bill Gates talked to IBM, he didn't have an operating system. He said that he did. That created a panic situation.

Speaker 3:          01:40:56       How often do you have a product and you announced the date for the product before the engineering is done, but are you talking about outliers? Then you talking about people that pulled things off that you know the average person probably doesn't mean. How many of you talked about the wayside. How many people do over promise and this is what I'm trying to get at, which is if you value regularity, then under promise over deliver, right? If you value shackleton like outliers, you may have to over promise and over deliver. So wait, wait, wait. Okay. Let's go ahead and you may have to risk over promising and under delivering

Speaker 3:          01:41:36       another thing. Women are averse to that. Oh absolutely. So women are averse to bullshitting people. Absolutely they are. I like, I'm not hiring chicks. I'm gonna start hiring chicks for the reason you're telling them to not be the way they are, but we're failing to communicate show. No, no, no, no. I'm just. I'm just playing devil's advocate and picking you apart a little bit. That's okay. But I think in other words, when when you start hearing people say, why aren't there more female founders of a billion dollar plus tech companies, my feeling is that a lot of those people who do found such companies are in this kind of fast and loose outlier idiom and very often females specifically because of the crazy demands of child rearing, which is something you cannot screw up. You have to be on all the time. You have to be incredibly regular,

Speaker 3:          01:42:30       have a very strong ethic of not screwing up branches positive. I don't want to say that it's negative, right? I'm not saying that it's negative. What I am saying is that if you are not happy because you were not represented in the outlier category, understand that not screwing up is not a behavior pattern that leads to outlier level results. I see what you're saying. I see what you're saying. So they almost have to go away from their natural instincts in adopt a different pattern or behavior to achieve extraordinary success. I mean, I would like to tell a lot more men, hey, you can't keep promising and failing to come through. So you know, it would be better if we had higher regularity from some men who chronically over promise and chronically under deliver and we had more women who were trying to swing for the fences. If the feeling is why are we not represented at the highest level of certain kinds of activities. So all right, so what I'm trying to get at is, is that we are not currently feeling safe enough to have these style of conversations where we're saying, look, to what extent are we holding ourselves back? Are we holding you back? What is it that we need to be doing? Or are we talking about the glass floor as well as the glass ceiling. So know the brick layer

Speaker 2:          01:43:51       unions. The is a famous example where if you look for pictures of brick layers, you'll generally see a bunch of guys, a very few women and there is no complaint that these have not been integrated. So there are ways in which you don't find women in the pinball arcades, you don't find them in brick layers unions and you find fewer of them founding, you know, multibillion dollar tech companies. So how do we feel about that? I don't know. I mean, the key question is if you want to see change, you have to be risking having a real conversation about these things. And what demore tried to do was to decouple intelligence from this problem and say it's much more temperament and interest. And the person who made that point on Dave Rubin show a month before the Google memo leak was my wife and she didn't get attacked because she said, look, you know, I was in an incredibly, you know, basically an all male environment.

Speaker 2:          01:44:50       I wasn't happy because of the temperament and interest when it got highly competitive. Uh, I didn't want to spend my energy and my time fighting. No, she has, she has like a Nobel quality result in economics. And her feeling was it's just not worth it to get into some multi-decade pissing match with incredibly powerful people. Now, my feeling about this is those guys are going down. We're gonna fight them. You know, I read my book, came out called the physics of Wall Street that I encourage women to read the chapter called a new Manhattan project. And the epilogue discusses her contribution, uh, and you know, in fact we sort of walked away from it in part because she didn't want to go to war and there's nothing wrong with not wanting to go to war, but that is a very big, temperamental difference that is not a cognitive difference.

Speaker 2:          01:45:47       And that's what I think the more we're saying now, I think you and I would both agree that we would never want anyone to discriminate against women for a job they're qualified for and that they're looking to get into. If they're good at it, we would like to see people who would like to see in a quality of opportunity. Right. More than that. More than that. Yeah. I mean if you think about how many women are offline and you think of it as like, just stop thinking about in terms of social good. And think about it as like when you like an oil field that hasn't been tapped, just their neuro field. See what you're saying is essential. Yeah. Right. Like, you know, you're just talking about Jews and physics. So one quarter of one percent of the world's population of 1:25 percent of the Nobel prizes in physics or thereabout.

Speaker 2:          01:46:36       Right? Very few Asian females have Nobel prizes. If, if I were trying to figure out, like with oilfields, I wouldn't go to Texas to try to find more oil because I'd figured pretty well picked over. I'd try find some other place. It's like I'm going to find great waves. Not In Hawaii, but I'm going to go to the Arctic, right? So let's say Asian females have a huge percentage of the world's neurons basically untapped. If you want to make tons of money, if you want to cure cancer, if you want to do all these things, figured out how to bring those neurons fully online. So it's not just a question of nobody wants to keep them out. There's a huge prize to be won for figuring out the puzzle.

Speaker 6:          01:47:16       Right? But it has not been proved that gender and sex have a role in what people are attracted to, are interested in. So why should we assume that just because we have these systems, whether they're economic systems, whether it's, um, you know, starting a business or whether it's working in tech, why should we assume that women would want to do that? Why should we encourage them to do that if they're not interested in it and why do we put so much value in it just because it generates incredible amount of money. Do you think that maybe what we're looking at is natural patterns? There's natural patterns where, I mean this is what demore argued, that men gravitate towards certain things more often than women. And that was one of the things that was so disturbing to me that was overlooked about his memo. He had a full page and a half dedicated to trying to encourage and various ways to try to encourage women to get into tech. Right? Nobody talked about that. The other thing that they didn't do is no one, not no one, but many of the people that read published his work and took snippets of it. They didn't publish the citations or the Bibliography, which is like Reno. It's immoral, but it's what it is, is back to your analogy. Yeah, these people are in a cult and this was a challenge to, to the ideology of the cult, so no, but

Speaker 2:          01:48:35       look, let's look at it from the felt experience in the felt experience is if you're, if you've already struggled as a woman against incredible odds to be in tech to begin with, you know that there's somebody whispering. Yeah, she's not very good. They only hired her because she was female and you're sick of this shit. Right? So you have to appreciate that. The lived experience of the women inside of Google is that they know that some percentage of those guys were saying, Hey, I just want to talk about studies are actually pissed off. Right? So their bullshit detectors are set very, very high. They think they're hearing dog whistles everywhere. Right? And so I don't think we should be blaming women who have been subjected to this as if this is not a real thing. There really are dog whistles. There really are people who don't want women in tech and want to go back to an all boys club, blah, Blah Blah for sure.

Speaker 2:          01:49:35       But that's not really what we're saying. No, we aren't, I don't think. No, but the issue is what if I need to do some amount, some relatively minimal amount of um, kind of intellectual terraforming to get all of these female neurons to work on all of these amazing problems. So what if, what if the people who have the answer for let's say cancer or Agi or who knows, happened to be female [inaudible], what if I needed to do some things in order to make the environment more attract? Like for example, programming in teams has to some extent per replaced. Cowboy programming was just some guy with his code and you know, a set of headphones and he, he goes to it. Okay. So that's what he was talking about. Like what are the, to what extent can you actually change the nature of work to bring these extra neurons online now that's the right reason to do this.

Speaker 2:          01:50:35       I don't think we should value like what is coding? It's some sort of highly logical, very technical persnickety activity if it's highly compensated, everybody wants in. If it's poorly compensated, only people who are sort of addicted to it would want it. Right. And it happens to be sort of high status at the moment. And so there's this feeling of, okay this must be an all boys club and maybe it grew up as an all boys club and maybe it has particular attributes, but the thing that I, I'm looking at maybe different from what you're looking at is that I'm thinking about particular high ability females who have left the game or who have sort of gone into a lower intensity mode because there's just sick of being in an all male environment. So if I can interject, you try and discourage attrition. I'm trying to discourage attrition of the amazing people who have something deep and powerful and important to say.

Speaker 2:          01:51:30       So the environment of these places is contrary to them establishing whatever strengths. So let me give. I would rather not talk about women and I'd rather talk about something I know very, very well, which is myself. Okay. So four and a half years ago I gave some talks on physics, um, which were terrifying to me because I wasn't trained as a physicist and they got a lot of attention and publicity at Oxford. I don't like the unpleasantness of intellectual oneupsmanship and negging, if you will, that takes place in particle theory. It's a turn off to me. And so I've sort of stayed away for four and a half years because I didn't like how unpleasant and hyper like exaggeratedly masculine it was. Why do you think that exists? Well, because it's a huge prize, right? I mean, if you're trying to get, gain Einstein's mantle, um, it's still a game worth winning because, you know, Einstein was times out of the century. So it's still because of this huge prize, there's also a lot of critical thinking and a lot of criticizing. Yeah. But there's a lot of just wasted. Yeah. There's like a Dick measuring contest that does nothing for me. Hmm. Okay. Right. And

Speaker 3:          01:52:45       so, so my point is, is that is a guy who's been in mathematics, physics, economics, finance, and tech. That's five hyper male fields. There are some of them that I just can't stand because there two exaggeratedly male and you feel like criticism is exaggeratedly male, not just criticism, it's just like snarky, stupid, mean spirited, nonconstructive main girl show, female show, maybe housewives of Beverly Hills. That's pretty pretty. Take downy. Yeah. That's a different version. So um, this is made you avoid these particular person makes lots of us men and women there would be more likely to avoid and you would lose the contribution trying to sell a lot of these brilliant minds. That part of the problem is, is that every time you have an extremely kind of overly like an exaggeratedly toxic culture, you get attrition from people who are really good at it or just don't like to go into work.

Speaker 3:          01:53:51       It makes sense. And putting that on women is not fair. Right? I don't want to do labor economics at Harvard for the same reason. It's a really unpleasant. I understand that once they've actually gotten to the game, but is that what keeps them from pursuing the game or is it natural inclinations towards other pursuits? I believe it's a mixture. It's a mixture. Most things, right? Well this is, this is really what, what Demora was saying. He was saying there's a 50 slash 50 default baseline that you've adopted. I don't think I. Ju, I James Damore don't think that we should accept 50 slash 50. We should figure out what percentage of this has to do with um, interest and inclination. Um, and that should be an adjustment and that we're sending tests do with prejudice and. Right. So break it into two components were off of 50 per, it's a plus b, where a is the natural amount that it, it should favor one gender or sex over the other.

Speaker 3:          01:54:49       And then b is the extent of systematic bias. That's a very analytical and I think a very. I think it's exactly what he was saying is exactly right. You're one of the very few people that has broken down like that. It became this weird ideological struggle, but I got into tremendous trouble because I let off a tweet that was about biologists, right? Because Richard Dawkins had just been deep platformed at Berkeley where he was going to speak as a biologist. My brother. Yeah. What was that about? Why did they do platform? Because you know, he said something on charitable about Islam, which means we have to get back to. Right. But the key point was is that I had three biologists to more Dawkins and Weinstein who had all been d platform, so I let off a tweet about, you know, for God's sake, stop teaching people that they should run to hr, um, rather than code, which had nothing to do with harassment at all. It was really just about seeing

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       a woman, uh, who deleted her tweet. I haven't talked about this until now because I, I felt that I, I reacted to her deleted tweet and then I still, I still have it on my computer, but I didn't want to bring it up. And then I was left holding the bag. Right. Um, what was the tweet? It was something like, dear Google, I don't teach my daughter to run to hr for financial freedom rather than code. Thanks a dad. And that was interpreted as like, oh, suck it up. If you're being harassed in the workplace, you know, do not suck it up. If you were being harassed in the workplace, I don't know how to make that clearer, but it's about if somebody is talking like a biologist and they're saying, oh, well there's pre prenatal testosterone and um, you know, they're the psychometrics and there, these are the conserved differences across cultures.

Speaker 2:          01:56:37       That's not a reason to go to hr. That's a reason to figure out whether the person is making sense, not making sense to take them on, in the arguments. Um, that's, I feel very passionately that discourse and free speech is incredibly important. When you, you distort what that guy was saying and you turn it into this hateful attack on women. You've shut down discourse and you discourage anybody else that has any sort of unusual opinion or unusual observation from coming forth because you're essentially, you're limiting free speech to free speech that you agree with. And this is what happened while I agree with this, but think about how difficult it has been. You know, as soon as I say, learn how to over promise and over deliver on risk under delivering that, that, that can take up 10 minutes. Like, are you telling me to bullshit and not, not come through?

Speaker 2:          01:57:29       No, I'm not saying that what I'm saying, but all of these higher level points all have lower level misinterpretations. Right? And so in this circumstance, it's also important to realize that after so many years of putting up with sort of whisper campaigns, it is understandable that women are sick of this shit. Right? So that's true to that too. Right? So the key question is, are we going to just deep platform all the biologists, are we going to pretend that there are no differences? Are we going to pretend that gender and sex have absolutely nothing to do with each other? Like this sort of fantasy life that you can try to lead a in a progressive context is going to destroy the underpinnings of Western civilization. And I have nothing against eastern civilization, but I'm an exponent of Western civilization. Yeah. And you know, this gets back to the issue of will we be able to talk anywhere in a safe enough fashion that we can have really meaningful conversations so that we can actually fix these fucking problem. Right. And the only way you're going to fix these problems is if you cut out all this, the, the, the ideological biases

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       on the right and the left, uh, the male and the female, and just look at the problem for what it really is. Well, and it's tough and we're challenged because we also don't see ourselves, but just firing that guy for that memo. And then here's the, my favorite part of my all time favorite part. They invited women to take time off because it was so stressful. I mean, you are, you are reinforcing the worst stereotypes that someone couldn't ever. You've actually read the memo and it was so disturbing to you that you had to take time off. You are insanely fragile or you're looking for time off. You're looking to take time off. Either one of those things reinforces the worst stereotypes that people have against women. Yeah, but what if the idea is different? What if the idea is that they've actually been experiencing trauma at somebody else's hands?

Speaker 3:          01:59:37       That wasn't James Demore. Okay, but that's not about the James Damore memo and I have it done right? Why have it? But you're having it directly in response to that guy's a memo, which wasn't in any way derogatory conversation. I go to India and I see a bunch of backwards swastikas with dots and then that have nothing to do with Nazis. Right. I'm a fucking triggered when we're going far though. We're pretty far away from that. Let's just talk about the internal memo that Google sense like why? Why give women off if you. Well, first of all, don't fire that fucking guy. Have a conversation with them and have open discourse. The biggest problem was firing because that establishes the precedent. That truck look. I called him up specifically to ask what the hell happened? And you know you've talked to him. Yes. He's soft spoken. Very kind, very nice guy.

Speaker 3:          02:00:27       James is pretty open so I'm going to say he's wildly introverted, almost certainly on the spectrum for sure. And his reaction was that I went to a meeting where they tried to teach diversity. The biology was wrong. They asked if I had any feedback. I told them and he wrote an 18 page man, but don't write this. This is how his brain thinks, which is why he's a coder, which is why he was a biologist, which is why champion the right, exactly. This is how it's very important that these people not be made unwelcome because fundamentally we're going 11 this untried social justice stuff in absolutely every well. Not only that, he was labeled as a misogynist over and over and over again, and you don't even giving the guy a chance to have a communication. We have open communication like if you sit down with them instead of firing. Problem is, is that if you say, come to the seminar, we're going to teach you things. The things are wrong and now we want your feedback. You're just setting certain minds up for this thing for sure. That said, and this is something I, I, I, this is much harder to bring to this room, this room, this room. What's wrong with, you know, because I'm, I'm part of this constellation of people, but we keep doing this. We keep making a mistake in my opinion, which is we

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       keep seeing these wrong things that happen in the space and we lose the empathy in some sense because people are not representing themselves well, so I believe having watched my wife and economics, that it is really corrosive to go in everyday to work in an environment which does not feel welcoming. Right? For sure. Very toxic, very bad for now. The idea is that something breaks the camel's back and it's approximate cause it's not the actual problem. Right. On how they framed it, they're saying they're giving people time off because there's diversity memos that he targets versus hard targets. Right? So the idea is is that he was a soft target, but they may have had, you know, many of these women may have had a manager who passed them over for promotions three times when they'd been. The major contributors sort of reinforces a rational ideas about his memo without actually reading the core components of it and look at objects.

Speaker 2:          02:02:39       Why I. that's why I was outspoken on the point is even well, I am outspoken on demaurice. Think there's issues that believed are fundamentally, we are in danger of breaking empathy with people who do not express themselves at our idiom. And I don't like the fragility, I don't like the, you know, there's this confusion between strong people versus very aggressive people and in general, stronger people are much less aggressive. Right? Isn't that, that's like loud yelling. People think that they're winning an argument because they're loud and yelling. Well, if you watch like the jungle book, Shere Khan, the tiger is portrayed as unfailingly polite, right? Because he's just, he doesn't need to prove himself. Right? So part of the problem is, is that we are waiting for the strongest voices to rise above the din and say, look, we can't be this aggressive about everything all the time.

Speaker 2:          02:03:41       Right? We have to actually think what's a misdemeanor, a felony, what's a foot fault? You know? So just to boil it all down, you don't think there's any issue with inviting women to take time off from a memo that you didn't even disagree with? Um, I absolutely think that there's a problem there, but I don't think that that's the right place. Google sitting on a pile of cash. It doesn't need all these people to show up. They botched this thing as far as I can tell. But why? Why tell women take some time off? You just got assaulted. You were just attacked by some horrible thing that doesn't discourage or that discourages diversity. That discourages the right thing to do, would be to retain demore. Right? And to say, look, we need to be able to talk about this without silencing each other with that terrifying each other without assuming that we've heard the other's argument.

Speaker 2:          02:04:37       Perhaps some public speeches where you have people opposes ideas and have them discuss. Right. Right. And, and make it public so that maybe people can learn from it instead of making it this gigantic campaign against one guy's idea and just destroying his credibility in a very sort of perverse way. How about just google has youtube, they have all the resources in the world to turn this into an educational experience. Exactly. Yeah. But the big problem was firing demore. Yes, I agree with what that did was it puts out a precedent, said, here's how this game should go. When you hear somebody say genotype versus phenotype complain. Yes. When you. When something makes you uncomfortable about psychometrics complaint, if somebody starts to agree with the implicit association tests and they won't own their own bigotry and bias complain. Right? Well that's terrifying. Well, it's sort of the same type of thinking that got your brother in hot water in Evergreen, but what I'm trying to get at is that we are, we who understand this problem, I think better than others and are willing to talk about it in public, are losing empathy because we're so sick of being worn down by these terrible arguments.

Speaker 2:          02:05:55       Right. And so, you know, can we, can we pop all the way back up to your original point about Islam? Sure. Okay. You asked the question why does the left seemingly weirdly supportive of practices that include female genital mutilation, honor, killing a terror, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. And I think it has to do with the fact that there is a fundamental inability to discuss these issues because nobody has given us the right tools and language. So the issue of Political Judaism, political Christianity in political Islam is one category. And then there's just sort of cultural Judaism, cultural Islam, Cultural Christianity. Now quite honestly, um,

Speaker 2:          02:06:52       you can easily be embedded in a Muslim community that is not devoted to political Islam and feel that you're very much in another abrahamic faith similar to Christianity and Judaism. On the other hand, there is a much bigger issue, which is that Islam has a totality to it that Judaism no longer has and that Christianity perhaps never had a Sam Harris points the out the line render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, um, cleaves off the potential for political Christianity at the same level as political Islam. So you're dealing with this different object that doesn't quite seem to have the same characteristics as the others. And you haven't been given tools to sort of pull it apart. You've also been taught that if you're proud of European civilization, um, that you are like pro white, a white is irrelevant to me. I care about European civilization just as I care about European barbarity having sat through European barbarity.

Speaker 2:          02:07:55       I'm not gonna give up on European civilization. Um, you know, so in, in part what you have is you have people who are making the vanilla confusion where they imagine that vanilla, you know, we use it to mean the absence of anything interesting, but in fact it's like the most interesting spice. And it's this, it's this particular orchid that's incredibly flavorful. So it's like a linguistic mistake. Well, white is that to European civilization. I have no attachment to my whiteness. I could care less, couldn't care less. On the other hand, I have a huge attachment to Newton, to Mozart to the terrible things that happened, uh, you know, in the, in the killing lands in the mid 20th century. Um, so the evil, the good, the imperialism, the guilt, like that tradition. I'm very resonant with the good, the bad and the ugly. And it is my tradition.

Speaker 2:          02:08:53       So when I meet somebody coming from China, I expect them to be an exponent of Chinese culture. Well, I don't wish to say, well, I don't have the right to have my own culture because I have to erase myself. Um, based on this confusion between this Canon that is incredibly value will and the skin color that is completely irrelevant to me. I don't, I would much rather have western civilization running between the ears of people who don't look anything like me and, you know, be proud of what the software has produced. Um, then, uh, have a bunch of people who look like me who don't think in any way that I recognize wherever the original point was. Why does the left wider progressive's fail to criticize the homophobia, the sexism, the, the honor killings, all the horrific acts. So let's talk about. Let's talk about a particular example.

Speaker 2:          02:09:49       Rolla. Have you ever heard of him? Yes. Revolutionary Afghan Women's Association. These are the, these are the most bad ass chicks on the planet. They are the ones who taught little girls under the Taliban. They are Muslim, they are proud Afghan women. Uh, they have Afghan men who risked their lives. These are people who take their lives in their own hands to educate women. And one of the most repressive places on earth that is Islam. Those are Muslims right now. My point is I try to get people interested in, won't you take the side of the Muslims who hold your values or the values closest to yours? And this is where we get into trouble because for some reason we don't perceive that there is almost an intellectual civil war within Islam with forces for modernity and forces that are trying to reboot a, you know, from original texts.

Speaker 6:          02:10:48       Right. So do you think that we associate Islam with maybe even a smaller faction of it than we really understand like the isis faction, the, the, the, the, the Taliban like thing, things that were terrified of. Well, people that are throwing gay folks off buildings,

Speaker 2:          02:11:07       we saw how weirdly view them as more authentic. Mm. Um, in some sense. And so you don't want to go against the authentic in aversions, but like for example, the hobbyist, a sort of Saudi Arabian variant I never thought was going to be influential over Pakistan because South Asians tended to look down. Um, but with, you know, all of this money that's been spent a exporting the sort of, um, particularly text oriented, very literal interpretations. Uh, I think we've, we've gone down a terrible path where we've sort of, weirdly, I'm not understood that there is a conflict and that we actually have a dog in this fight, in the dog, in this fight is a, those who are trying to create cultural Islam and cleaving off political Islam. I don't want to live under Sharia law and I don't want to feel bad about this. I don't want to live under anybody's religious law. I don't want anyone to live under Halakhic Jewish law. And this is a mainstay of Western civilization. And when we can't feel comfortable about that, which is like, well, who are you to say whether we should live in under sharia? Law? Answer is, I come from a culture myself. It's not like I have no culture, this is my culture. We do not live under religious law period. The end.

Speaker 6:          02:12:26       It's fascinating to me how very how many different ID allowed ideologies exist and how much they vary in how people can just slot right into those and accept them as the end all be all period and it's to me, just from a evolutionary psychology standpoint, just looking at the broad spectrum of different ideologies that people slot into. It's so fascinating. It's so fascinating how many different mindsets that people adhere to that are unwavering and rigid and how common it is. It's so uncommon to not have an ideology. I mean, it seems like this idea of what will will the numbers that we have of atheists and agnostics in America today, I mean, is this unprecedented? Is this the most, the largest group of human beings ever that are looking at things and going, maybe nobody has the answer. Maybe this isn't the right way. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:13:21       Well, I, I, but I also think that a lot of those agnostics and atheists have more religious leanings than they'll open up to and a lot more of the folks

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       are able to run the atheist agnostic program almost perfectly, uh, between their ears as well. I don't think it's as clean as let's say, you know, Sam [inaudible], Sam Harris might make a difference what I was going to get to next. Why is it that so many people who are atheists and agnostics adopt religious tendencies in terms of cultural behavior and what they're willing to accept and not willing to set, except a lot of the stuff that you see that you're calling earlier when you were saying people that describe racism and you know, do, do you describe it as power and influence these cult member ideas? You're a lot of times getting these cult member ideas from people that will tell you that they're not a part of an ideology. They're not religious, but they're exhibiting dogmatic religious ideology. So that was my question is, is it just a, a thing that we are inherently programmed to slot into?

Speaker 3:          02:14:30       Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is, this is the big point where when Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris got into it the first time on Sam show that was so confused and it was, well, it was confusing and Sam would have, would have appeared to have won that one pretty decisively because Jordan tried to fold in fitness to the definition of truth. She does not work, right? Jordan's point, however, was really deep and I don't think he did it, uh, the service it needed to be to have done. I think there would have been better off in person. I don't like conversations where people are talking on skype and I've refused so far to do any podcast where I'm not looking at the person because I believe that the eye contact too. Yeah, it's huge. I've done one so far that it was with John Anthony West, that brilliant egyptologist and it just because he's was ill and he lives in New York and it's just hard to get.

Speaker 3:          02:15:23       It was awkward. Yeah, I do it if I had to. But in general, it's like how many fights have happened over unicode and asked exactly just bad message board fights, how many of them would even take place when you were looking at each other, talking to each other. Tone, tone, social cues is. It's completely with video conferencing is that you find that you're staring right above the person's eyes. So there's no trust. Yes. So it's weird. But what I was going to say is that Jordan Peterson's really deep point is, if I understand it. So Jordan, if you're out there, please correct me. I'm his only archetype of the kind found in religion is sufficiently rich and deep to explain why humans behave the way they do. There's no scientific theory that's good enough. There's no purely logical. There's no purely philosophical tradition. So as of the moment we're stuck with deep cultural archetype.

Speaker 3:          02:16:21       Maybe Shakespeare would be the only thing comparable to the religious cannons and the claim that you're making implicitly in the Jordan is making perhaps more explicitly is that there's something about our brains maybe that we were parented and so we need to give the parenting apparatus over to something else. I don't know. That fundamentally finds its way to religion. Even if the computer that is our brain knows that it's making leaps that don't make sense. How old are your kids? Mine are 12 and 15. Do you, when you see them, do you see things that are you and your wife and wonder like, is this, how much of this is genetics? How much of this is them mimicking their environment? How much of it as both. And then there's the Sui generis stuff that comes from God knows where that I have no idea cut into their head at all.

Speaker 3:          02:17:15       Well, culture, the uh, books and I mean don't, don't discount individual invention. Sure. For sure. That too. So I believe that my son who's 12, I'm has gravitated very strongly towards Judaism. Um, so we go to services. I don't think he believes in a technical sense, but he enjoys the service. Yeah. But you know, again, so many of us just don't. Well, the music is beautiful sentiments. The richness. I mean, coming back to Jordan's point, it's not. Part of it was like hearing during a heart. All right, you're in like a star wars drama or you're in Kung Fu panda and don't let go to some. You know, you're, you're going to a place whether it's a temple or a chapel or you know, you're going to. This place is uniquely ornate environment. You know, we have particular words. For example, the rabbis tell us, you know, we usually don't say this because this is what we have stolen from the angels, but this was the one time in the year when we can actually shout it and it's potent staff potent and you know, you're gonna to your original point.

Speaker 3:          02:18:27       So you have some weird tradition that makes no sense. That produces it ridiculously disproportionate number of the Nobel prizes, let's say in science. You would it be scientific to throw that away? I don't think so. No. Right. So if you were a good scientist, you'd say, I don't know what's going on with these weird rituals. It's like, you know, it could be the funky chicken, you know, or the Hokey Pokey, but something is made, you know, if, if most of the people who win Nobel prizes were founded to do the Hokey Pokey, I'd probably put more effort into it and maybe it's not. Maybe it's not attached to the ideas that spawn from these religions at all. Maybe it's that these people have the freedom to think about these other things because they have intense confidence in their future and their destiny and their God and their traditions and their ethics and their also carved out that this.

Speaker 3:          02:19:18       I've always thought of religion in some ways is almost being like a moral scaffolding. Like, okay, well you got like a real clear structure to operate under and that that gives you resources. It gives you a frees up resources to do other things. I mean, the problem is is that the atheist critique, which is like there is no bearded dude in a cloud granting your wishes are listening to what you know, bitch. That's my answer to you know, because everybody who says there's No God and nothing happens when you die, like you don't know that to say that as no different than someone saying they know for sure there's a god in the cloud with a harp and St Peter and you to go look at a list, but if we conjure art, if we conjure Sam and we tried to steal me and sam, Sam will say, okay, but there's all these explicit ways that you're supposed to worship God.

Speaker 3:          02:20:06       They can't all be right because they're mutual incompatibilities and so how do you choose one among many and if and left, okay, blah, blah, blah. None of this is the point. The point is deep archetype is its own thing and the mind seeks deep archetype. It's white cares about the godfather pictures differently than home alone. Home alone is not deep archetype, godfather pictures or deep archetype. Right? Okay. This is why I'm on Kung Fu. Kung Fu panda, like white on rice. That is deep archetypes. Those are actually pretty God damn good movies now. Just the first one. The second one is not bad. My kids liked it. They're younger than yours. Don't hide behind my kids. Just I liked it. I enjoy it. I enjoyed him. I enjoyed the lego movies, man. I said I've never seen. All of them are not bad. This last Ninjago one's not bad. I enjoy it. So I think that just messing me.

Speaker 3:          02:21:03       There's a lot of fucking dumb shit that I like though. That said. Really? Yeah. I like it. A lot of dumb shit musically. What's some dumb shit that Jaylen Kiss? That is dumb shit. Every now and then man, I'm on my way to the comedy store. I'll throw on. I was made for loving you. It was fun. Yeah. That's not so bad. But I prefer angus young in school. Boy Pay. I don't mind it either. I like him as well. Yeah. Look, I like all kinds of music. But um, I, I wonder when it comes to archetypes, whether or not when I was getting to, when I was talking about your sons and your children, whether or not their behavior is genetic, whether or not it's learned experience, whether it's a combination of all things, how much of what we have is just in these, this sort of inclination towards ideologies is because pretty much everybody had them for the thousands and thousands and thousands of years that we had civilization and we are in some way shape or form the product of all that stuff. Even genetically, like whatever memories. I don't totally understand genetics, but what I do understand is that there's a lot that we don't know about why ideas get transferred from father to son, from children, from parents to children. And there's things that get transferred. Even two adopted kids that come directly

Speaker 6:          02:22:26       from their parents in a very eerie way where you go, well, where did, is there some like what? Our instincts, why? Why are children are afraid of spiders and monsters? Like what is that? Is it because at one point in time someone near them was killed by a big cat, you know, thousands of years ago, you know, back when we were living in these environments where we were preyed upon by predators. I mean, what, what are the reasons why? And Rupert sheldrake had a great point about that. If you talk to children in New York City, they're not afraid of child molesters or murderers or things that they might encounter a car accidents. They're afraid of monsters like w why? What is a monster and that monster may very well be the memory or the ancient genetic memory. I think it's this. I mean, I think if you look at, for example, the evil stepmother, oh, well that's real too, right?

Speaker 6:          02:23:18       Okay. Yeah, but what was that about? Probably it had to do with the fact that the first thing that you want to teach your children is, hey, if I'm not around and daddy remarries somebody who has no interest in you genetically, here's the emergency break glass in case of emergency plan. Right? There's a little of that, but it's also, how many times does that play out where someone has to tell that story because it's so common. We all know it. We all know the story. I have a good friend of mine who was essentially tortured by a stepfather or throughout growing up. I mean, it has a horrific life story and it's just one of a million, one of millions. But sometimes what we do is we, we sort of go obliquely at these things. So for example, in Little Red Riding Hood, um, you know, is the Fox Fox or there's the wolf, sorry, as a wolf.

Speaker 6:          02:24:09       A wolf. The wolf actually wolf stand in. Well, I think it's a wolf because throughout Europe, fourth fucking thousands of years. Wolves preyed on the wolf is pretty creepy in this kind of thing because wolves are clever, you know? Do you know that in Paris, in I think the early 14 hundreds wolves killed something. Like what was the number, some insane number of people in Paris, like 14 people were killed by wolves. No, I didn't know. In Paris they're starting to show up in Paris again. Okay, what was her fucking dangerous land? It will look. So I think everybody that everybody respects the wolf, but they're clever yesterday about wolves is they. They have some sort of template for the better to see you with my dear. Right? Because he was being clever mean. Okay, but you asked the question about predators. Somebody the big bad wolf, the three pigs. It's all wolves. There's a lot of wolves and ancient folk lore and stay the fuck out of the woods. It's always stay out of the woods because there's wolves in the woods, right? So what's the woods is in central park? No, it's real woods. People live near the fucking woods. They weren't new doors and those kinds of cities. When they wrote these stories, when the grimm brothers were around, there was no central park, right? Yeah. All I'm

Speaker 3:          02:25:23       suggesting is that a lot of our information comes coated so that it doesn't point to directly. Maybe, maybe stepmothers. Zircons and wolves are dangerous. Stepmothers. I take no responsibility for this man. There's a lot of amazing stepmothers. Now let's say 30 seconds worth of things. That's wonderful step, but there's amazing step mothers, but there's obviously some monsters. There's obviously some monster, but just to your point, it's not always step mother, step father. The question is what happens when Mommy or daddy remarries? Sometimes it's awesome. Right? Often it's not. Right. And why? Because of this issue about genetic relatedness. So sure to you, to your earlier question, I was stunned. I didn't think about 23 and me as a religious test, but when I sent my saliva off to be analyzed, it came back. You were a Jew like 98 point six percent. Well I didn't. I didn't know my religion was in my saliva. It didn't even occur to me.

Speaker 3:          02:26:27       Yeah. But it's a. But that's the weird thing about Jews, right? Is that it's a religion, but it was also an ethnicity. Right, right, right. And so the idea is that all of these rules, you know, dietary restrictions or rules for who gets to Mary, at what level in the culture, where do you put your resources? Are you proselytizing or do you try to live at steady state? Do discourage people converting in all of these things or some sort of toolkit for living and it has produced more physicists, uh, then, um, you know, outfielders, right? So it's not good at everything. It's good. Some things at the exclusion of others. And so the question about how does the stuff co travel, it co travels in some way that's very mysterious, you know, do we pass on trauma? Uh, I can say in my family for sure that my family stopped being religious when my great uncle Sasha was killed right at the end of World War Two.

Speaker 3:          02:27:28       And my great grandmother said, no, no, compassionate God would kill somebody so stupidly, uh, who had so much to give to their family and change the family from some kind of Orthodoxy to Orthodox atheism. And then, you know, for three generations you have Jews marrying Jews with nobody believing in anything. Why are they continuing to marry Jews? Why are they celebrating these holidays? Well, it's because fundamentally a switch got flipped, but my guess is that the Orthodox, we're always questioning whether there was a god. The atheists are always questioning whether there's a god at some level because our brains are not just simple computers to be know, rid of bias. They have particular needs. So my, my four things that I care about our truth, fitness meaning and grace, all of those tradeoff amongst

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       each other. And when I said something like this on Sam Sam Harris's program, a lot of the people who wrote in said, Oh, you know, shows that he doesn't care about truth. And you know, I, I felt like no, it just shows that you guys don't understand how important. What is the argument? I understand the argument, Sam would like to make an argument that the better and more rational our thinking is, the more it can do everything that religion once did. So if you've had a dmt or lsd experience that can give you meaning and transcendence, uh, you know, if you can think your way more accurately through a problem, that should increase your fitness. You know, maybe grace is something that's independent and you have to figure out whether that's important to you. But that's a choice that an, you know, an elected. I'm objective and my belief is that a lot of these things are actually preset and that there's more antagonism between them. So I, I think of myself as an atheist, but it's only because there's a room in my mind that I try to keep very, very clean and analytical that I, I sort of make the first among equals, but I have needs for these other things. I haven't, you know, there are times when the truth doesn't give me enough meaning and I'll start storytelling. Okay. You know, we're, we're surrounded. We've got to fight our way out, you know, like all that kind of narrative.

Speaker 6:          02:29:43       So Joseph Campbell's type stuff, don't you think that there'd been the end, there's lessons to be learned in those, right? But it's. And there's meaning in all those stories and there's a longing that we have for a lot of those hero's journey type narratives. But um, but truth is significantly more important than just these lessons that we learned from hero's journeys. Like learning the lessons is important. They're fascinating. They're interesting. The stories are amazing. But what's really going on? Like what biological processes are responsible for certain types of behavior. You know, what, what really is happening to human bodies under certain conditions. What is really happening to the earth, what is really happening as far as the mail.

Speaker 2:          02:30:26       Yeah. My friend Peter Teal critiques me on this point just as you have where he says you eric, under value and underweight the role of truth, but I worry that we're not even having a conversation. If I think about my personal physics hero rock, uh, who's the coyote came up with the equation for the electron less well known than the, uh, Einstein equations, but arguably even more beautiful in order to predict that he needed a positively charged in a negatively charged particle. And the only two known at the time with the electron and the Proton to make up, let's say a hydrogen atom. Well, the Proton is quite a bit heavier than the electronic. And so he told a story that wasn't really true where the Proton was the antiparticle of the electron. And Heisenberg pointed

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       out that couldn't be because the masses are too far off and they'd have to be equal. Well, a short time later, the anti electron positron that is, was found, I guess by Anderson at Caltech in the early thirties, and then an anti-proton was created some time later, so it turned out that the story had more meaning than the exact version of the story. So the story was sort of more true than the version of the story that was originally told. And I could tell you a similar story with, with Einstein. I could tell it to you with Darwin, um, who, you know, didn't fully understand the implications of his theory as is evidenced by his screwing up a particular kind of orchid, uh, in his later work, uh, not understanding that his theory completely explained that orchid. So there's all sorts of ways in which we get the truth wrong.

Speaker 3:          02:32:12       The first several times we try it, but the meaning of the story that we tell somehow remains intact. And I think that that's a very difficult lesson for people who just want to say, look, I want to, you know, like fineman would say, look, if experiment disagrees with you than you're wrong. And it's a very appealing story to tell to people, but it's also worth noting that [inaudible] never got a physical law of nature and it may be that he was too wedded to this kind of rude judgment of the unforgiving. You know, you can imagine you were to innovate and in Brazilian Jujitsu the first few times it might not actually work, but if you told yourself a story, no, no, no, this is actually genius, and it's working, and you're like, no, you just lost three consecutive bouts. Well, that may give you the ability to eventually perfect the move.

Speaker 3:          02:33:04       Perfect the technique, even though you were lying to yourself during the period in which it was being set up, it's a little bit like the difference between scaffolding and a building. And too often people who are crazy about truth rejects scaffolding, which is an intermediate stage in getting to the final truth. So well, the problem with that analogy is that some techniques work, but they just don't work for you. And the reason why they don't work for you is you don't know them good enough yet, right or not. You can eat that. Yeah. We have a problem with that. Now. We can just wrap this up if you're that hungry. We're on the homestretch, buddy. We got seven more minutes. Can't take it anymore. I'm sorry. Insulin lower issues. I crashed. Listen, let me just wrap this up. Anyway, this is a. This was a really fun conversation.

Speaker 3:          02:33:49       Really feel like that eating that bar. He definitely has changed the butter. Crashed it. I know what you. You were so hungry. You had to eat in the middle of talking. I was told I could go to the bathroom here to go to. Well, he said you could do it for like six people. Go fucking crazy when you hear people chewing on the microphone. It was the number one thing that people complain about on this podcast. I apologize to them. No worries. We've had these fight companion podcast and people fucking potato chips and they're eating potato chips on the podcast and I just would get

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       my twitter would be filled with people fucking furious so slightly. No, America is hang in there too. Sorry. You gotta you gotTa. Be comfortable being uncomfortable like a couple minutes. I can do it too. What I was gonna say is that analogy is not the best analogy because some things work. They just don't work for you. Like I'm one of the analogies as used in Brazilian Jujitsu is like someone will try a technique and it doesn't work for them, and they're like, well that took me. It's no good. And I'll say, okay, well you know that head kicks work right? You've seen people kick people in the head and knocked them unconscious. Right. Okay. Try to kick me in the head. Well, I don't know how to kick people in the head. There you go. Even if I show you how well you're not gonna be able to do it.

Speaker 1:          02:35:01       If I show you how to kick people in the head, do you think you gonna be able to kick someone that actually knows how to fight and ed? No. They're going to move that. They're going to see it coming. You're gonna. It's gonna. Be too slow. You're not going to have your neural pathways carved to the point where that thing just slices right in there. You're not going to know how to set it up, you're not going to have the confidence and the experience to execute it. The difference between that and the truth is very different because it doesn't require some sort of physical process for you to master before you can execute it with sufficient prowess to actually be successful. While I think you know, this has to do with placeholder truth. Um, you know, the famous example of tricky gnosis and pork, where if you believe that God hates those who eat the pig, do you think that's what that's about?

Speaker 1:          02:35:48       I think it's about tricking most likely, right? Or various other parasites, right? Right. So, you know how long, well, malaria, right, bad air, shellfish, red tide, right? Don't eat shellfish, right? So all of these things have to do with, I'm not quite sure that I can explain to you why this is a bad thing, but let's have a placeholder and then we'll refine it over time. Come to understand what it is that we're doing less. We're rigid with our ideology and we'd go buy some ancient scripture that ancient scripture says that anything with a cloven hooves that eats its own cud. You know, like there's all these weird laws like this is your, what are you're allowed to eat. This is what you're not allowed to eat. Except that that's very often not how things work. So my fear is is that it's a little bit the emily latella effect on religion where the atheist concept of a religious person is usually the sort of robot that just looks right and in fact, what you often find is that you're rewarded for brilliance in a religion by not having to follow the rules nearly as closely.

Speaker 1:          02:36:58       If you become adept at argument, it's sort of like really Christian people with a cross tattooed on them. That could be right and you make some art. Well for example, in Islam contract marriage where you need to get married for a few hours so that you can set your urges with your wife who

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       then becomes not your wife. A short time later, your arbitrage in the letter of the law against the need. For some sort of a human realism, so they have contract marriages where you're like, let's get married for a day. Yeah, really sweet. Good move. I think everybody should do that. Just to find out what the hell that person's really like. You don't know anybody until you actually marry him. Once it was shacked up with them and you're living for awhile and they have access to your money, then you want. Then you get to find out what they're really like. One point 6 billion people are considering your words right now. I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing. I do think that. I don't think that many people live in this podcast. We're okay. You know, we had a situation I think in, uh, in the late [inaudible] in Israel where people were using bread crumbs to fish, uh, as bait.

Speaker 3:          02:38:06       And the question was, will, does that invalidate the entire water supply of Israel during Passover? And so rabbi rabbis had to be convened and if you know, pay the sufficient amount of money, genius level rabbis could figure out why it was okay to drink the water during Passover. Right? So the issue of getting around your own rules is a time honored religious tradition where, you know, any book that is not a book for, for living in survival and thriving, uh, is consigned to the dustbin of history. And so the fact that these things have been around for so long in general means that they have their own means of evading these self extinguishing programs that would seem to doom them. Well, some of them, those self extinguishing programs, the way they evaded is through fear, right? I mean, isn't that the fear by Isel cheating on them?

Speaker 3:          02:38:59       Yeah. Right. And so the is of, you know, if you attack on Yom Kippor, uh, does that mean you can't fight back because you should. You're supposed to be atoning for your sins. Now, if you want to survive, you're going to figure out a way to fight on Yom Kippor. Well, what about Ramadan? I guarantee you, nobody, you know, if it were so easy to defeat people, uh, using their own religious traditions against them, uh, we wouldn't know the name of these religions and we wouldn't, we wouldn't know the genius of the books. How many did we lose? How many religions, if we forgot what they were and be like, Joe and Ted's excellent religion.

Speaker 3:          02:39:34       I would ever just didn't make the cut, you know? I mean, how many from epic of Gilgamesh from those days I would, I would guess tons. What'd they call it? What was the heaven's gate? Remember the Nike's that killed themselves when the comment or the self castrating yeah. Yeah. The one guy who led it was a self cashiering issue with the Shaker furniture that they were down to like one or there were three shakers at some point. Then there was like one and they were accepting. No note, no new recruits. My favorite is the amish. They have that a, is that called Rom scholar? What does that crazy thing go nuts. They go nuts for like a year from spring it out is. That was one year where they just

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       go fucking hog wild. They don't have to follow the rules, and then they usually feel so lost and disconnected that they, they. I think the majority of them returned to being amish. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm pretty sure find their way to burning man. No, I don't think they go that kind of now, so I think it's more like booze and ACDC type nuts. They just fuck a lot and get crazy and throw rocks. You know what I'm going to. I'm going to look for the Amish camp next year. Eric. This is a really beautiful conversation. Exceeded my expectations. I really enjoyed it and we should do this more often, Joe. Thanks for a terrific. Thanks man. All right folks. We'll be back tomorrow with the great and powerful Christina possessed ski. Who's Netflix special is out today. Hey.
