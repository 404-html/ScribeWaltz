Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey fuckers were back crazy, isn't it? I'll answer my own question. Yes, Joe. It is. It's crazy. This episode of the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by, Oh, you going with nature box? I was going to say tank. Naturebox is fine. Let's start with them. It's fantastic and inevit. Naturebox is a, an option that you can get delivered to your home, to your office snacks that are far healthier than anything you're ever going to find in a vending machine and you can get them adjusted to whatever your dietary requirements are. Like me, I'm essentially gluten free. Occasionally I've fuck off and eat a hot dog or something like that, but for the most part, I don't fuck around with bread, so I get gluten free options. They send me things like blueberry Ahmond's, which are great. These big island, a Hawaiian pineapples are also fantastic.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       You can get things that are very low in sugar. They have no artificial flavorings, no hydrogenated, nasty fucking weird oils and shit. Your body doesn't like to digest like Zero Trans Fats, zero high fructose corn syrup, nothing artificial, free shipping. Also anywhere in the u s naturebox is a great option to avoiding the nonsense that you get inside vending machines. If you're hungry and you're at work, healthy snacks, barbecue, kettle kernels, um, everything bagel sticks, south Pacific plantain chips and other one of my personal favorites. I get them delivered every week and they usually gone within a day or two cause I'm kind of a fucking pig. Uh, these, there's pistachio clusters also these, uh, cocoa almonds. Ah, they got a lot of good options. Um, and if you're into very specific dietary requirements, like low sugar, they can accommodate all that kind of stuff. There's a lot of different options.

Speaker 1:          00:01:50       And A, I'm a big fan. It's all very delicious too and a lot of it is, you know, completely guilt free. Um, and if you go to naturebox, go to naturebox.com forward slash, Rogen, that's naturebox.com forward slash Rogen. You can get 50% off of your first box. And I guarantee you, once you do it, you're going to love it and you're going to want to do it all the time. It's a a way better alternative than most of the stuff that you're going to get. If you go searching for snacks. Even at a grocery story you mean you're going to have to really pick and choose to find healthy snacks that have no artificial flavors, no artificial colors, no nuns, and it's like trans fats and high fructose corn syrup. That shit is really bad for you. If you want to find out how bad, go watch a documentary called king corn.

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       Find out how it all happened and find out what, what that stuff actually does to your body. Uh, naturebox is a way to move around all that shit and snack guilt free. You need calories, you need food, you need snacks. Go to naturebox.com forward slash Rogen again and get 50% off. Your first box of Yummy naturebox foods were also brought to you by ting. And what Ting is, is a no bullshit alternative to the cell phone coverage that most of us get. Most of us get cell phone coverage from the big companies and you got to deal with a lot of stupid shit like contracts. Ting provides you with the same service that you would get if you were on sprint. They use the sprint backbone and they rent time on it and then they sell you that time with the sprint rules. They sell it to you with no early termination fees, no contracts as far as like canceling, cancel anytime, anytime you want.

Speaker 1:          00:03:33       And they sell the best android phones available. All the coolest groovy android phones, like the HTC one or the Samsung Galaxy. Now it's s five, the new ones pretty fucking slick and the new and actually has a, um, it's, it's got a fingerprint sensor, a heart rate monitor and it's waterproof. Good googly Mowgli. Where does it end? Um, the waterproof is sweet though. I'd love that option. I have the galaxy note three and I fucking love it. It's giant and it's really cool if you want to go online with it. When I used to go in line with my iPhone, um, it was kind of like just, it was okay to do better than not being able to go check out something online. But I oftentimes when I'm on the road, I don't even use my laptop. I'll just use my galaxy note three the entire time.

Speaker 1:          00:04:21       These a android phones have not just caught up to iPhones in my opinion, they've passed them and a lot of ways features, options, just not just the big screen but the note three, the one that I use has a stylus. You can write notes on it and then those notes I use Evernote and it actually sends those notes to my home computer so I can look at my notes on my laptop. It's pretty fucking slick. Um, Ting also has it set up so that you don't pay for a specific amount of minutes every month. You just pay for what you use. And I think that's the model that all cell phone companies are going to use eventually because a lot of times you're, you're only using a certain amount of cell phone minutes, but you get in fucking robbed because you're paying for much more. And if you get over that minutes or go over those minutes, then you get hit up with a big fee.

Speaker 1:          00:05:06       You get hit up with extra charges because you use too much service. It's fucking stupid. With Ting, you use what you pay for and I personally believe that that is going to be the model that they all use in the future. I think when companies like ting come along, ethical companies that do things correctly and they're cool about it, they do cool shit. Like on their two year anniversary, they slashed all their prices. Um, and especially helpful for people who are heavy users. People are heavy users and heavy internet users. They made a big impact on people's bills. In fact, 98% of people would save money with Ting. It's because they do mobile differently. Go to rogan.ting.com and save 25 bucks off of your first device.

Speaker 3:          00:09:30       the Joe Rogan experience, Joe Rogan podcast all day.

Speaker 2:          00:09:39       Todd, uh, Dylan and Liam Reznikov. Am I saying it correctly? Liam is a guy from the underground, from mixed martial arts.com. We've been, uh, online friends. That's how you say it. Online correspondence. Carswell yeah. Well there's a brotherhood, uh, on the, the underground that's, uh, it's one of the most interesting mixed martial arts websites in the world. I think it's the best one as far as access to information. And, um, you think I put up the, the Helio Gracie chronicles two, right? I can't comment on that because at the time I was a Btt guy and now I'm a Hoya Gracie guys, we're going to have to move these things. The, um, how, how are you going to set these up so they could see, uh, we could see your faces better. Oh yeah. Scoot over a little bit that way, that way, that way it's not a hope in Leeann's face.

Speaker 2:          00:10:28       Um, and um, so Liam, uh, put the, well, you get in trouble for that. Did you get in trouble for that? There was a guy with a similar name to me. He put them up, I think. Oh, okay. Okay, cool. Whatever, whatever. It totally wasn't you. Oh yeah. Right. Absolutely. Anyway, um, recently, uh, you put up, uh, uh, an attention Joe Rogan thread, which will they, those things go up every now and then on the underground. Yeah. It's usually like you suck your mother's a whore or something like that. I didn't want to enable anybody by doing that. You know, he bought a thought, you know, we're coming through America and you know, we're coming to la, so he's got to talk right into this. Sorry, just bring it around to you. I didn't want to enable anybody, so you know, they're going to come out of the woodworks, the Weirdos now, but they'll come out anywhere.

Speaker 2:          00:11:10       There's no way you could stop them as sitting at the table with you now. Yeah. It's the Internet. So, um, you, you contacted me and uh, I'd seen you online, I know that you a, you run a gym in Sydney. Yes. Yes. What's the name of your gym? [inaudible] Academy in Sydney and VT one is a MMA teach more there. You guys have pretty much all mixed martial arts. It's sort of like a white color academy with some UFC fighters, that sort of thing. So it's a good place for regular folks to train. Yeah. Oh we starting to scout whole and we've kind of, it just keeps moving forward and we've ended up with a big academy by mistake. Yeah, well that's the best way to do everything. But just follow what you love and it all happens absolutely by mistake. And so you put this thread up about you and your brother Dylan being

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       in town, your brother Dylan, being a, a former championship kickboxer former professional motorcycle racer. And just the beginning of the, the thread was so crazy because you were a motorcycle racer who stopped doing motorcycle racing because he had too many concussions. So what are you going to you in a fucking Thai boxing? What? What is and then he became a champion. That's right. Yeah. Sound like a lady boy today. It what's going on or your voice. It's a great way to reach you in the UFC. Oh, we had one of the last day this last week and came back and he, we always lose off. That's why he's lost his voice now. So he sounds like one of your students was fighting in the UFC. How did he do? Oh, he won. He was saying, Oh, Z to win in the prelim thing of it was, what's his name?

Speaker 4:          00:12:41       Richard Walsh. Filthy rich. Okay, cool. Cool. Yeah, he was one of your students. Awesome. He was on the flight paths and a lot of people saw it, but he's, I think he's going to be a straight the face. Well, I was going to say, should look up, there's an article about him online. If you type in the face of MMA in Australia, cal Noke, right. He's the big guy, right. It's the most famous and Hector Lombard, a lot of folks don't know, trained in Australia when he got out of Cuba, a lot of his fighting initially in Australia before he fought for Bell Atar. And then for the UFC, he's not really Australian as such. But yeah, you're looking at these amazing fighter. I have to loves Australia. He's an amazing fighter of course. But, uh, I don't think we told them about, uh, when we were in Canada and like how MMA has gone down in Australia and it's shot up in Canada.

Speaker 4:          00:13:23       It's going down now. So it's, it's, it's been, um, tell lot of troubles since the first UFC show. I don't know if it's, um, I dunno, it's like my theory on it was basically that we just kind of need someone coming up that makes it, you know, like, um, a lot of the guys were fighting now like, uh, Jamie and, um, to Hoonah and Anthony portion them, they're, they're, um, they're already quite established before they hit, um, the UFC. So I think on a, we need kind of like a GSP sort of character, you know, and every man sort of guy. Yeah, I see what you're saying. Well you need someone who is like a championship level fighter will look at in Jamie is amazing. I, it's not that, it's just that like, you know, Dylan sing over here weighs about a 63 killers he did for now Isabella am.

Speaker 4:          00:14:11       But um, you know, there's no one for him to really look up and go, man, I can be that guy because a lot of the guys are um, heavyweights in Australia. You know, there's no real light guys. Right, right. I kind of think that's affecting the scene a little bit. Maybe it's a, it's a theory. It's an interesting theory. I think if you had a champion that would immediately get everybody excited behind it, JB to Hoonah as possibly a, I mean a potential. He's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Two is tough guy. Um, there's a, there's a few Kyle know cause also tough guy and um, you know, there's, who else is fighting Australia, you know, he got a hunt who's out in New Zealand. Yeah. But it's, it's hard for like, it's hard for kind of like a middle class Australian kid too, or a rugby player, which are often private school boys to

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       kind of look at some like Marchand who's just amazing fighter. Don't get me wrong. But yeah, it's, it's not a, Oh, that guy's led the way in the way I'm going to do it. No disrespect is an amazing fighter. You know what I mean? I think, yeah, I think, you know what I'm saying. So you need someone who's like a wholesome Australia and regular guy who the folks can relate to. Like go on a fucking great guy. He's a great guy. You know what I mean? Yeah. No, I totally do. I didn't know that a Australian MMA has started to decline though. I didn't, I wasn't aware of that. There's not a lot of opportunity out there at the moment, unfortunately. You know, like I'm, one of our girls is fighting in the house. I'm the one coming up and I'm in, she was on hold for a year at a time because there's just nothing going on.

Speaker 2:          00:15:36       You know, there's just a couple of local promotions. But how, I mean, most of the guys move over. Steve's overstays. I was thinking of something I was playing overseas like Carl and, and um, stay there, you know, because they have to, Brian Ebersol went to Australia as well, didn't they? It for a while over there for quite a long time. Right. He's doing now. He's in Thailand now living into, yeah, he's having a bunch of issues, like a physical issues. I didn't know they had a tough guys had it. Yeah. Very tough guy. Very smart guy too. Very crafty fighter inside a bunch of back things is a few things going wrong. Kept him out of action for a while. Um, so anyway, so how the fuck does a guy who is having problems with concussions, what, what was your rationalization to not just go into Moy Tai, but to become a more Thai world champion?

Speaker 2:          00:16:21       That's fucking bananas. That seems like worse path you could take if you've added head problems. Yeah, I meant like, um, look, we grew up to much, lots of both Liam and I, you know, dad would had karate schools in South Africa. We were born and I can be quite at schools in Australia, so it was in our blood, like we already were doing martial arts, uncles boxes, et cetera. Um, but my dad also racing motorbikes to barefoot water skiing and look all the barefoot water skiing. So that was my first proper sport with my dad and my uncle. How the fuck are you barefoot water ski? Do you want to tell them what they used to do? Me, I mean, actually funny. No, it's, if you look at his nose, he tells everyone a broken kickboxing. It was barefoot skiing. They used to the Monkees to chuck us a on the back of the boat, um, in Sydney to set a small lake called Brooklyn and used to be like, no, you'll be fine.

Speaker 2:          00:17:11       Just chuck us on a surfboard, crank it up, put their hand up, you know, you stick your feet in. And I was like eight. And then they will just drag you behind his motorboat. You gotta understand like South Africans Sell Africans are what we call like a white belt and nothing, they've never walk barefooted before, but they've got an idea of how to do it. We saw a few videos, a few videos, youtube. So this wasn't something that they were like adept in. They just give it a shot. They did it behind a smaller boat when her South Africa look where we used to ski and they didn't know anything about slumming. So they'd get 'em snow skis. You'd, you go on both

Speaker 4:          00:17:49       and then kick one off then you'd have to go fetch it. Yeah. Normally the one ski kick it off for that. She hit you. There's no lunch kicking off. What do you mean? So, so basically, um, like when you slalom slate Lumpski slaloms sorry, both a bit sick at the moment you come up out of the water out of it. But I dad and uncle and didn't know how to do that. So they just put you on two skis and you'd kick one off and then go find it later. It's just, that's every Saturday we have a bit of a reputation of being a little bit different. What it South Africa's a kind of a crazy place, huh? To madness. Absolute madness from Cape Cape Town's not that mad. This is more Johannesburg, Johannesburg. Cape Town is not that crazy. Will you just went, it's not too bad. I met Johannesburg and then you know like we were driving back from a night out and we had to cook our response to come actually follow us back to our house because we thought someone was following me.

Speaker 4:          00:18:45       The whole response, that's the police ex Congo fighters that like I'm hanging around the neighborhood, which private security guards with massive guns and cars. So you just call them up, look and walking home. Someone's looking at me, you call the number and the car comes and follows you home. You really, I mean we're not from Janet. I was in Johannesburg and I was staying at a place called box book and I told my other friends, they want a nicer place in Johannesburg. I was there for a wedding and I was thinking pocketbook book and my friends were like, are you out of your mind? You know, we had guides at the front with guns, like securing the complex and everyone's got dogs and I was on the phone to my friend and across the road there was a shootout. It's, it's basically like a saint judge Dredd, the the new one that's film that's film, that thing. It's mad. It's mad that you don't stop at Red Lights. You don't stop at Red Lights, but if you look at Shirley's, they're on. They've got beautiful girls there, so that makes up for it in a way really so hard to shake up.

Speaker 4:          00:19:49       Cape Town's different than from, it's a bit more like it's beautiful in the year, so keep down safe fairly well. I had a guy try get into my car when I was there and I just drove another side of the road and just disappeared. They were, one of the dangers is still and came home and he's saying, you know, kicked down safe. And I thought, man, you know, it's not, it's safer, but I wouldn't be relaxing. Like it's, you know, Sydney, Sydney is very safe, you know. Yeah. They did this thing on some television show when they were talking about South Africa and all the car jackings. And so they had all these different cards that they had wired up to prevent carjackings mad that they have these bars on the side of the car that blow flames on anyone standing next to the car. That's fucking crazy thing goes ready.

Speaker 4:          00:20:34       And my dad says, you know, if we go to South Africa, he's driving because you know, you will, we don't, if people are lined up across the road, I mean, Dylan, no Dylan, I will stop. He says, and they just keep, you can't into different to Cape Town, but he's like, you know, they'll stop you and then contact you. The day I arrived there, I remember seeing on, um, youtube was, it was only a couple, it was in November last year. And I remember seeing a car pull up, just put guns straight at that window and they dragged like it was all over the all over TV dragged, you know, like four or five kids out of the car, just throw him to the curb and just drove off. They haven't got really, uh, they're really care too much for life. You understand? It's like, it's like Brazil. People go, why would you live there that you've got a lot of potential to make money there, you know, and you've got a comfortable lifestyle.

Speaker 4:          00:21:17       And again, we're not from there, but that's our friends who are from Johannesburg. We say, why or why the hell would you stay there? Or they've been there for generations. You can't bring the money out to, can't bring the money out. It's $1 Australian to 11 round. So when I go there, I shut everyone burgers. It's cheap for us. What does that even mean? Will shout everyone. Burgers. Oh, shots like shout as in like pay for everyone forever. It's funny when I'm sitting here, I'm noticing he's talking about South Africa and he, his accent's becoming sell African. Is it as we're talking about it, I'm a, how old were you guys when you left South Africa? One years old. Well that's ridiculous. How the fuck can you keep us out? The African area went to city even talk you were a baby. It's, we're from actually funny enough farm and we're talking about accents.

Speaker 4:          00:22:00       Nobody, this whole trip has recognized that accents as Australia because Australians sound like kind of wait, Canadians crossed with New Zealanders, you know, like, cause we watched TV and we listened to podcasts and stuff. So you know what you have on your show. I'm Jim Jeffries. I mean when you listened to him you think he's like Paul Hogan son, you know, because when you come here to be recognized, he does his farm. So knives, which is where we're from. Yeah, I've talked to him off podcast. Not Quite as Australian where we're from the same suburb. But look, he's very funny. Hilarious, very far. Um, is he most famous comic out of Australia? I don't think he's, I mean within the people that we know, he's not that well known, but I mean his every now and again someone to come up and say, hey, check this clip out.

Speaker 4:          00:22:51       You know? And he's brilliant obviously. Yeah, he was telling me that a long time ago. I want to know if that had changed, that he was having a hard time in Australia, that he was famous in America. It was doing well in America but not so well in Australia. Australians are weird. Like if you're an American, you come to Australia, your accent will make you funny or instantly, you know, like think about our accent. Like if I say ass say, I mean in America it's not tough. It's not funny. It's not, well there's certain Comedians, I don't want to name the names, but there are certain comedians that get a little bit of extra credit because they have an English accent. Like we'll, we'll accept someone from another country and we'll pretend that they're way better than they really are. And then you watch their comedy like, like American College, like the kind of dog shit. Like, what's the fuck is going on Jackson? No Irish is that adds charm points instantly. A little bit. He's got a Scottish accent as well. Um, yeah, we, we, we like other accents. I don't know what the fuck that's about. Girls love it too, man. Give me the girls love Australian accents, right? Don't guys, can we pull it

Speaker 2:          00:23:45       off? You know, he says get a, and every time we, we have never said get that in Australia. Nobody in Australia says good day, but you meet a girl over here. You throw it around like let her know. We always say that's the first question we get every time from an American crews and Kangaroo Kangaroos, the furthest you can get on a plane. What's the furthest flight you can make in one shot? Is it Australia? La. Wow. Yeah. It's pretty fun. No, England's only 10 hours from here. I was still at the Sydney is 16 long gas. We haven't slept more than about four hours for the last three weeks. Probably. Like we're just not adjusting well. Yeah, I've done it twice and it's a fucking brutal flight. It's an awesome place though. I've only been to Sydney. That's the only place I've been in Australia.

Speaker 2:          00:24:35       I fucking love it, man. If I was going to live outside of America is on the shortlist. It's the place where we are now. I mean, not saying where it is, but where we are now is very similar to suburban Sydney. We were driving around and we're like, oh, this looks like ride, but you're on the wrong side of the road. We're on the wrong side of the escalator, the wrong side of the road. They don't start everything. You know that awkward moment when you're just like walking out of one of those doors, you know in Vegas, who in Vegas yesterday and you walk into someone and you normally shift to the left or right. We got left because we drive on the left. They shift. Right. So we're both going the same way. I'm like, buddy, move without the way you move. Yeah. He keeps saying, look at that car.

Speaker 2:          00:25:15       No one's driving it like we're driving and I'm looking at that time. There's no one in the front seat because it's the wrong side. Just sitting a kid that baby's driving. It's pretty scary, man. Our Lando and our driver was telling us that oftentimes people come from Europe or from England or where have you and they in their countries, they drive on the other side of the road. So they'd come to Disneyworld, get drunk and get on the wrong side of the highway. Well, he doesn't let me drive. He doesn't trust me. He is the mechanical guy. I'm the directions and she got a Mustang. So pretty happy about it. Oh, you're very excited. Did you guys know why the left side and the right side, do you know what the origin of that shit is? I heard an explanation, but I don't, I'll tell you what it is the left side, the reason why they did it in England and uh, a lot of those countries is because it was from way back in the day when people would ride horses because you wanted to have your sword arm on the right hand side.

Speaker 2:          00:26:07       If someone was coming the other way so you could fucking hack at them. So we did American go wrong where they decided no more war. Fuck it. Maybe. Yeah, maybe it was. Maybe Henry Ford was a fucking lefty. I don't know. I don't know what started it off. Well, it's fun. I mean, our whole trip, we basically spend the whole time, Josh, I mean you guys, you guys in America looking around and your drive and your board and this an interstate, this and that. For us it's like watching movies through our eyes. You know, like we just drove past Sherman oaks and I was watching no retreat, no surrender last week. And we were just like, that's fucking Sherman oaks. I took photos, no surrender, no retreat, no surrender. You never saw that sort of, that's a karate movie or something. But back home in the day, the guy's name, it was van dam's firsts. Oh, okay.

Speaker 2:          00:26:54       We're going to take photos. That's [inaudible] areas and silly suburb. I think we got stopped by there. It is render. We watched it last week. It's the greatest. Have you ever seen there's John Claude van Damme reality show. Oh, where he does a lot of coke and then whatever these lawyer, Mike will be happy about that. But yeah, whenever he does a lot of coke, it's still like go fuck himself. I liked the guy too, but his reality show is God damn brilliant. He's such a, he's so crazy. Oh, he's so off the fucking chain. Crazy that you watch his reality show and you just like, he kept, kept talking, keep talking about this fight that he's going to have with the tie. That's like 90 years old. Well, it doesn't matter that he's not having a fight and he's just, you know it. I know it. He knows it.

Speaker 2:          00:27:43       Everyone knows that that's filming it. It's like this weird charade that he puts on where he pretends cries, where he starts talking about the fight. I'm going to have to fight to show the children I'm going to knock him out. But it's like the way he talks, it's like a character in a such a romantic, like fake romantic, romantic, like a romantic in a bad movie. It's like he's become a guy who speaks in bad dialogue. He's like, become that guy. Well, I mean, I went to ask you about that. Um, you know, he still speaks to that accident, had been living here forever. So zone of Schwartzenegger right. Does he live here? Oh, I mean, I'm just saying I don't show, it looks like he's in another country. It's hard to tell. I, and one of them I remember he's, he gets, has a spine match.

Speaker 2:          00:28:23       Just some random sheikh dude and psychics India. Did you say? No, I didn't see that episode. He's um, but um, they'll saying when we were up in Canada or someone was saying to know GSP for example, has kept his accent and a certain level because it's so recognizable and no, I think that was true. Somebody was saying that George lives in Montreal and George George speaks perfect French. I mean, it's not his accent. I, when I talked to George outside of the octagon, he speaks exactly like that. He does what he does. Yeah. He's just, he's very authentic. We just, the reason I bring it, I was just wondering if like van dam's handlers or George's handlers haven't kept him. You know what I mean? Like then if he started talking like it's like this, George doesn't have those kinds of handlers. George has trainers and you know, Jujitsu coaches and mixed martial arts training.

Speaker 2:          00:29:07       He doesn't have those kind of handlers, but maybe, maybe, but van, I mean George was just in that Captain America movie, but he really didn't talk all that much. It was mostly him just kicking ass. You know, it's fun movie. Did you see Captain America? Fucking, we watched three. There's a problem with the movie and obvious problem was that Captain America knows the Hawk and he doesn't call them right. What isn't fucking world's about to end and he knows this invincible green dude. Why wouldn't you just go, hey look, there's some shit going down. I'm trying to get my ass kicked. I'll be right back. I want to make a call. The hall comes flying in it. I'm just fucking smashes everything. The movie's over in 10 minutes. You know that all those dudes, like if captain America's Duking it out with those dudes and they're going blow for blow, the hug finishes everything in five seconds to fucking movie is over.

Speaker 2:          00:29:54       No, no plot to take over the world. It's over. It's over. Everybody rest, rest assured that sleep tight that the Ed Norton went on TV. The other Vegas Hixon yeah, with Hickson and the first 45 minutes of the movie or a him avoiding wrecking stuff. You know, like he doesn't even do anything. Just 45. The mark was his name. Mark Ruffalo. Is that his name? Fall. Yeah, that guy. He's awesome. He's the best banner ever. Here's another piece of American Trivia. Uh, the, in the comic books, his name is Bruce Banner, but when they made the television show, they changed it to David Banner because they think Bruce is a gay name.

Speaker 2:          00:30:30       That's how silly we are. We're fucking so we love America are a silly shit man. So back to you man. How the fuck did the route get right back to that question. How the fuck do you go from having too many concussions in motorcycle racing? How many concussions did you have by the way? Um, have blocks at about four big accidents on the track. So four out cold. Kod flatlined probably that three. If it has three hospitalizations from head injuries, um Oh, that was just from the motorbikes. Um, well you didn't wreck your body. No, it's actually all right. That's all right. So let's just head injuries. Um, yeah, a couple of, to be honest, we that she had no major injuries from barefoot water skiing, fighting racy blacks. That's incredible. It's not the pool riding recently that didn't got to, it was the worst thing.

Speaker 2:          00:31:21       You shut the fuck up. You started go riding. Yeah. So you're the manliest man alive. You only do sandwich shit. That's the funny thing I loved pool riders could find, only started getting into it. Like you love bull riding. Well I put my shoulder landed upside down. You kind of stopped doing this time. We had a guy on fear factor that had been a professional bull rider and he had just had scars all over his shoulder. Hip. We constructed like eight times and he said that anything goes wrong, plop, it just pops out on his shoulders. Just loose as fuck. Well the thing is the hospital called me and my friends call me. Oh yeah, Dylan's dislocated his shoulder. I'm like, all right, here we go. Um, I'm in the hospital, my dad full 12 times a year. Just always little things to storage, stupid things, you know, but, but they call me and I was just like, tell them till doing, I'm fucking happy. He just got his shoulder. Could it be got to talk? That's a big difference in the volume. It's a bit intimidating looking at it. I always think of it used to it. It can't be when you say it that that's a black Dick joke for those at home that are listening, not watching, but he'd just called out to me. So the first thing I did was I was like, fuck your brother. I was like basically just like fuck you. This is because we are in the academy

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       together as fuck you. You brought you descheduled shoulder. You're lucky it wasn't your neck hung up the phone and I'm not even going to deal with it because I'm just like, why are you glad you're writing? Look, I retired from fighting about a year ago, year and a half ago. It'd be living in Thailand on and off for a long time. And it's a very hard thing for people that are like, you know, eight, nine, 10 years in. They create, I mean look at John Wayne pose. Actually a good friend of mine. Yeah, I love that 10 great guy. And you couldn't say one bad thing about dark grape grape. Great fighter. Great Guy. Really good guy. You got to get him on the show. I love it. So funny. I met him for the first time about a year ago when he came to the UFC. I got him tickets for the fights. Well that guy, big fan.

Speaker 4:          00:33:19       I went to ask you a question about that being a celebrity of sorts. I mean, you are a celebrity I guess. Um, absolutely. Um, I was just don't like to kind of like recognize celebrity to some degree. Like they feel embarrassed, you know. But one thing I was going to say is looking on the Internet, I want to know how you deal with this and I'm taking it off topic again. Sorry. But um, you know, like some guy comes up to me the other day and he's like, ah, Wayne par. Yeah. Here is all fake. He's a dick and this and that. No, he's absolutely not fake. Absolutely. Like he'd got up at 9:00 AM hangover to do, to treat one of our students to pads. Like he's the genuine, nicest dude. I agree. But it just seems like you can't be a celebrity without some Dick just just shut, right? Yeah. Making shit up about, well, eventually you realize that the only type of people that would do that, they would attack you for no reason or idiots. So if you're going to live your life worrying about idiots or worrying about bitter negative people,

Speaker 1:          00:34:12       some people are actually smart. Some people will attack you and they're smart and they write these scathing negative things about you that are not true, not based on reality. They make these judgements of you. They decide who, how you think and they flavor you and their, their, their posts there, whether it's a message board post or a blog post, but they're just negative people. And then there's a real problem with being able to post on the internet, whether it's posting on a message forum or whether it's making a blog. And that problem is, it's not a, you're not interacting, you're just putting out a thing, which is fine. You know, there's, there's, there's good to that because you know, you could read things that people write, whether it's a blog post or a message board forum posts like on the underground that could be very informative and fascinating, but also you can decide to fly, you know, Liam is obsessed with himself.

Speaker 1:          00:35:05       His ideas are bullshit, his ideas are, and you can just go on and on and on with all of this, uh, add homonyms and all these fallacies about a person and the person's not there to respond. And so if that person reads it like, no, I'm not what the fuck ass, but this is not a conversation. And those kind of interactions would never take place. If someone was in front of you, if they were in front of John Wayne, Paul, John, where he pours food, he's bullshit and John, wait, probably wait, Tom, about my, yeah, well they wouldn't say to them and that they did that. He'd be like, okay, well how am I faking? Explain how I'm fake. And you be like, well, I've never done that. Like what is this guide book would just be like, oh, that's your problem. It just wouldn't even react.

Speaker 1:          00:35:45       And he's a self actualize, you know, he's got personal sovereignty. He doesn't need a fucking idiots. He's their opinion of him to, to define him. But people will try to define you and they'll try to define you and a bunch of ways. But most of the time, the reason why they tried to define you is cause their failures. Whether they're personal failures, whether they're professional failures, their failures, their life in some way, shape or form. If they don't have a real interaction, like you didn't steal from them, you didn't do anything to them personally. If they don't have a real beef with you, they just decide to start attacking you all. Most always it's because they're losers. Yeah. So you're dealing with a pool of people that are almost all failures. What they see in you, if they, whether it's John Wayne part like John Wayne part is a multiple time world champion.

Speaker 1:          00:36:31       I mean he's a bona fide bad motherfucker. I mean he's a guy that look at him. There he is right there. And George St Pierre brought him in to help him with his kickboxing. I mean he's just, he's, he's his legitimate, again, when we're going to fucking stack of belts. Well a guy who sees a guy like that and you, you know, men measure themselves against other men, they don't like it. Imagine is Ebay store. I have had fucking conversation with someone like a, Hey, what's up? Hey, how are you doing? And then fucking that one person will tell someone else some 20 minutes story about what a Douche I was. Cause I didn't say, Hey, what's up the right way. You know, people just decide that they're going to define you because defining you in a negative way somehow or another makes them feel less bad about how they compare themselves to you.

Speaker 1:          00:37:18       When they compare themselves to guy like John Wayne par, they come up short. I mean, he's a fucking savage. He's a rare human being. So you compare yourself to them. You don't like it, hey, that guy's a fucking fake. He to this. He said that people love to just chop people down. It's that crabs in a bucket mentality. You know, a crabs in a bucket is put a bunch of crabs in a bucket. They can never get out of that bucket because as they're trying to get out of the bucket, the other crabs pull on them and drag them down. Well, Hey, he actually, I mean, you can talk about it instead of me, Austin you, but um, I mean for a fighter it must be terrible because you can get knocked out and you look silly when you're knocked out. I mean, not silly, but I mean it's, it's not a nice moment, right?

Speaker 1:          00:37:56       This is a video of a guy coming up to Rashad Evans with a photograph of when Leo Machida knocked him out. You know that famous photo cause he got really knocked out and he was unconscious. The Guy was asking Rashad to sign it with a big smile on his face. Well you stopped going dead after a logon. Yeah, I had him just riding for me, man. I was his publicist. Yeah. Basically I'll just take off the internet and that there's other, the other problem is this anon anonymity, the ability to post something as you know [inaudible] 69 you need to make some fake name up and you could just say the meanest shit about somebody you know, instead of like a photo of you. And here's my background is where I went to school. This is what I've accomplished in my life and this is what I think about Dylan.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       You know, instead of saying that, you know, you just post some nonsense, some fake account or fake name rather anonymity with sensitive information and insults, it just doesn't work that way. When you, the thing about insulting someone, if you define someone in salt, someone most of the time there's like an evaluation process during that insulting, like the guy, like if someone's a fucking 300 pound guy just shit his pants and he's calling you a loser, it's really difficult to take them seriously. It's like, oh, I'm a loser. But you know, if someone's an anonymous poster online, all that evaluation kind of goes away. It's like, do you take that person's opinion seriously? Yeah, it is. Look at the underground. How many fucking pros posting the underground, where's the last time you saw John Jones posting on the underground was the last time. A lot of them work.

Speaker 1:          00:39:26       They go in to creep around, they look, but when they post just so many fucking assholes. I mean Tito Ortiz is probably like one of the last guys that stopped posting, but even he gave up after a while. How many times can you hear people anonymous, 14 year olds to shit all over you. You know? But I treat it like snake venom and I feel like you get bit by a snake and you could really get fucked up, but if you get bit by a little bit of snake venom every day, you get immune to it. That's how I look at it personally, but it's an, it's just a side effect of this stage of interaction because there's not going to be Indiana anonymity and you know what I mean? It's not going to be an anonymity within the next decade or two decades or whatever. It's going to be.

Speaker 1:          00:40:08       Enjoy your privacy and your freedom now because it's not going to exist 20 years, 30 years from now. It's just not in a way. I mean for a guy like me, it's normal because I'm already not anonymous so I'm already out there, but I think everyone's going to be out there like that. People are going to pretty much know as much about you as as humanly possible. Yeah. Well that's coming on the show. It's funny, we talked a lot about this and I'm, one of the projects we're doing is with that I'm with the growing down. What is with a psychologist and he, we were talking about it and being on the show and stuff and you know, we've got a business that we teach kids, you know, we teach adults and um, we teach a lot of sensitive people and like a white collar area.

Speaker 1:          00:40:48       Right. And the psychologist friend of mine, Jonathan back, he's a, he's on the, on the other showed he um, he took him a while to open up a little bit because he was worried, you know, people get a lot of information about you on these things, you know, and um, they can judge you, they can use it against you, this and that. Like, especially if you're somebody who likes to talk like we do oil, I suppose you do as well. And just give opinions and think and shout things out. It seems like it might be a little bit dangerous. What did you write? It looks like a Dick. What'd you write? What? Just worn it? What? Worrying about the effect of what you say can have it a public scene. Whereas if you're a buyer, you can say whatever you want, you know? Right. Well, yeah, there's definitely gonna be a lot of people that judge your thoughts and your opinions and how you express yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:41:30       But at the end of the day, it forces you to evaluate your thoughts and your opinions and how you express yourself and you, you know, you have to, you have to own your words and you have to mean what you say and say what you mean. And once you do that, you're like, I'm comfortable with it. There's not a single thing I've ever said on this podcast that I feel like, man, that really are really fucked up when I said that, because now people have a different opinion of me. My, my opinions that I say on the podcast are well thought out. And I'm lucky that I started it, you know, later in my life, I didn't do a podcast when I was 20 when I was a fucking idiot. You know, I think back on that like, God dammit, if there's podcasts from when I was 20, oh my God, he could hold it against me to the end of time because we all learn.

Speaker 1:          00:42:10       We have to be, if you're going to be out there and you gotta to take chances, you're going to fuck up. You know, and you're going to fuck up socially, intellectually, uh, along the ways. The only way a person learns is by trial and error, trial and error, and absorbing information from other sources. Those are the way you learn on your own by your own failures and your, your attempts at, you know, accomplishing things that you're not really qualified to do. And then you learn from other people's information and from other people's failures. But that's just what we do. But when you fail online, man, you know, I mean, how many fucking knock out animated gifs? If you seen, I mean, for the longest time, remember that Guy Fred Adish? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Poor fucking guy was torch a Fred adish, she's a guy who fought in UFC one and he fought Johnny roads and Johnny roads beat him down.

Speaker 1:          00:42:58       And, uh, there was a guy who started a website called the Fred editor are rife for it, fetal fighting style. Like, cause he curled up in a fetal position what Johnny Rhodes has beaten them down. So they were torturing this puff fucking guy and he's, he's quite, he's fought against since then. He had one fight MMA. Well, you learn Jujitsu, Lee, you know, it became a real MMA fighter and yeah, I think he fought more than once, but you know, he's a legitimate martial artists. He just like a lot of us back then, before the UFC came along, he didn't understand what real fighting was about. He thought that his karate was enough. I, you know, when I was doing taekwondo, if, uh, if the UFC had been around when I had only done taekwondo, I probably would've thought that taekwondo is enough and somebody would have taken me down and strangled me.

Speaker 1:          00:43:40       Um, when I first went into kickboxing, it was a huge realization to me that I, I thought that taekwondo was enough and that I was getting my face punched in. I was like, oh my God, like there's so many holes in this style. And then I started more time and I'm like, Oh God dammit kicking the legs. And then it was Jujitsu. It was like, oh well fucking Christ, I've spent all this time doing this one style that I thought was sufficient. But that's what the UFC was all about. It was exposing the world to the effectiveness of real martial arts. I'm laughing because I ended up doing Jiu Jitsu extensively and he did white. So I, but he ended up doing Jujitsu because every time we get into an argument over Mirc Jujitsu would wick, oh yeah, I'd take them down strangle.

Speaker 1:          00:44:26       Well, most people have no idea how help us. They are in the ground until it happens. You have all these and you know, Dana White and I had this conversation in a day. He used to joke around about it, but he was still always think if a guy tries to take me down, I'm fucking hit him with an upper cut and do this and do that. Diana says in the old days, I used to, not now, no. He's like, I really thought that before we went, we, you know, we own the UFC before I started learning about mixed martial arts. He's, it's, it's like we laugh about it because everyone has these preconceived notions and you don't realize how helpless you are until you actually do it. Well, he's got to bounce it to hit you now, so I'm going to, well, nobody's hitting anyway. He's a sweetheart days. One of the nicest guys. The point is that most people have no idea how help us. They really are until they actually roll. Yeah. Hey, hey. He proceeded to Jitsu quite seriously for a while. As a result. How frustrating is like, leave, get the hell off the computer. It's too easy. Right? It's fucking frustrating.

Speaker 1:          00:45:28       He kind of just like near your brother in the face. It's not, you know, you try, try, try it. Well, I've tried once the credit, well at least you're a martial artists though. They're, the really crazy thing is when you get someone who has no martial arts experience whatsoever and you know, he'd go, okay, um, lie on top of me and try to keep me from strangling you. Ready, set, go. And they'll try to like hold you in place and then the next thing you know, breath isn't fucking 10 seconds. They're essentially a dead man. Yeah. You know, it's, it's, that's the beautiful thing about Jujitsu and that's what you Jitsu showed the world. But these poor guys like Fred Edis and these poor guys that had to, they had to be the reason why we learned, we had to see these guys learn. We had a c, you know, these guys get taken down art Jimmerson with his boxing and one glove on.

Speaker 1:          00:46:12       You know, we had to see these guys getting taken down and our Jimmerson wants a rematch with Royce Gracie and she's, I can talk to him recently about it. He's a bit cut a little bit, taking a few of those. But in Thailand, it's funny. Um, it's getting a bit better now, but every time we'd go, there were a couple of places like super that had a cage and the tires would be like, yeah, I'm going to fight him. Amaze soon. I've got a big heart, you know, I can and clinch there clinches ridiculous. But when you hit the ground that don't have the ability to relax, they just don't, they don't really get it. Yeah. It's a shame but it's a very different thing, you know, especially a more or any, any kind of striking going from striking the grappling. Like I've seen friends that are good boxers and they got very good endurance like hitting the pads.

Speaker 1:          00:46:55       They can hit the bag for, you know, five, six rounds, no problem there role for a minute. And they were exhausted. We just don't understand this. A totally different style of moving, conserving your energy is just a, but you know those guys, man, we owe such a huge debt of gratitude to the original UFC fighters because they showed us with their own humiliation in their losses. You know, and even guys who are like bad ass is like Orlando Veit. You remember that guy that Moitai is going to be out of animal man, the commentaries, oh, he'll be out of this shortly. Lucky is rem co Pardue

Speaker 2:          00:47:29       elbowed him into another universe. That was a horrific knock out too because he was trapped on it as giant judo guy who just smashing him with elbows and his head, his head is stuck there. He's just Bong, bong. It's huge judo guy just crushing him, you know? And then he gets crushed by Marco who os and the hoists, Gracie and all these other people. We learned, you know, we really learned what, what real fighting is. So many of us had all these like crazy ideas of what fighting was. I think I was like 12 and I was in England. Oh, in England. I went to England, do some holiday family and they've said, listen man did it. You got to get me this. Um, this crazy cage fighting. It's illegal in Australia. Like you couldn't add black in Australia. What knows? You see one of those three?

Speaker 2:          00:48:15       Those three? Definitely two was the first one that came out on video. What year was this? We watched it in about 25 I think. But it was definitely three because voice, I was expecting us to smash everybody and then he pulled out. So first we have watched because in Australia we just didn't have access. It was just, we used to trade VHS tapes overseas, you know, that was the only way we could do it. Right. Was that one of your businesses for yeah. Well in high school I couldn't get ahold of her. So I had this UFC three tape and then I, I legally sent it overseas to trade it with somebody. So I had to tapes and then we had three tapes and then I'd trade three and I'd have three tapes, six tapes, etc. But I remember we watched it and we wait until everybody went downstairs cause we thought someone was going to die.

Speaker 2:          00:48:58       So we were huddled around the thing. We pushed play and of course nobody died because nothing back. Well, they could have though, man, because the medical tests they did on those guys, fucking nothing, man. You know, there was nothing going on. There's three people in there and hope they survived. And Joseph, it looks like he probably has been messing around on a corner a little bit. Well, you know, Joe signs in jail now murdered someone now. No. Well he murdered someone in jail, but he went to jail because he was a part of a gang rape. Yeah, they did a, I don't know what happened. You got arrested for something else and they, uh, they, they matched his DNA sample with an unsolved gang rape. I'm laughing at the giant cross. Anytime you see someone that extreme, you know, they're going the other way. Short Joseline used to hang around the comedy store and before he ever got arrested, and he was so weird, man.

Speaker 2:          00:49:43       He called everybody sir, call you sir and mister and he would hug everybody. He was really, really weird man. It was a really weird, cause he was like five foot, two inches jacked just in the, and he was hanging around and everybody was like, this guy's fucking crazy. It was like a weird dog that he was like, you were hoping that didn't bite you. And everybody's like, yeah, nice dog or cat, you know in Australia, you know like when we have weird dudes, you don't generally worry about um, getting stabbed or shot in America. It's a real concern with drugs and stuff, but we just don't have, um, you've done have that imminent sense of danger that you guys, obviously this is a safe, the safe areas, but you just don't hear about it in Australia as much. There's more fist fights. Is that what it is? Fist foot bottlings as well. Bottlings are chosen. That's fucking scary shit.

Speaker 2:          00:50:34       Coward, punching, punching, sucker, punch, hit. If you hit someone, why you're intoxicated or even, I don't know what the exact goal, it just got passed. It's massive. Chelsea killed, got hit and died by this big juice head who said he was an MMA fighter and that was bad. So he got sucker punched and he got, well they were, they were two or three kids arguing with him. Uh, they will kind of like, you know, well dressed sort of kids and the guy hit one of them and then he fell and hit his head. He hit his head and died. And um, they want to change it to say, um, it's not called a sucker punch or king had, it's called a coward punch. It's Australia kind of rallies behind these odd things like that. And now they've also made it that you can't go out, you can't come into a bar after a certain time.

Speaker 2:          00:51:18       I got locked down after this. Doesn't mean we ain't got much, but three o'clock, you can't, whatever club you're in, you've got to stay there. Like you can't come and go, Huh? What is that? It they've got no common sense. It's just a keep the decay down the street. So when you go out with your wife, they're waiting on the corner, rejected from a club. So it's worse. Well, you know, I man, the idea of having these places where people consume the worst drug ever for social behavior and it's all over the world. Alcohol is the worst drug ever for social behavior. Lowers inhibitions, makes you feel like a bad motherfucker when you're not, gives you terrible, shitty judgment. I mean, it's like the worst drug as far as like getting involved in fights. If we had pot clubs, if we had places where all you could do with smoke pot, you go to a place and just eat brownies and smoke pot, there would be no fucking fights.

Speaker 2:          00:52:05       Nobody wants to fight on pot. They just don't, even if you're thinking about fighting, like I gotta go, I gotta get Outta here. That's all. Canadians are so nice, like crazy. That is nice period because they're not trying to take over the world. Big fucking problems with, uh, America is an, America has got this long, deep history of trying to take over the world or defend against other people trying to take over the world. So it's just fucking group of psychopaths live in writer. Neat. These nice folks to the north. Yeah. Well, no, he just went to Quebec and Montreal was beautiful. Zack, he's wicked fun. Fantastic. Oh, the Canadians are the nicest people in the world. That's the other short list place that I would move to Vancouver. You ever been to Vancouver? We went there for one another. God Damn. That place is awesome.

Speaker 2:          00:52:46       Amazing. So, uh, another city that I really thought about moving there in 2004 after a Bush won a reelection, I really thought about moving. I was cause like everybody's so fucking crazy. He wanted again, like how could he win and how the fuck did that guy, when after all this nonsense that everybody knows about him, it's crazy fake war that they drag this into. It's not a real war under fake pretenses, but I was like, this country is going to turn into some banana fucking republic police state. Like we gotta get Outta here for us living in Australia. I mean it's, it's a very much a candidate. It's very relaxed and um, it's almost a little bit too fortunate. And I had a friend move here because he, um, he just said it's really easy in Australia to be middle class, but it's very difficult to make a lot of money and be upper class and there's, there's just, America just has that kind of, um, the ability to [inaudible] move up as a bit of romance.

Speaker 2:          00:53:38       Right. Maybe you don't see it as for us. We see it. I can imagine. Yeah. I could see that they did the caste system and the class system that exists in England and exists in a lot of other places in the world. Yeah. I think it was a really bad, isn't heavy. Some of the, we went to Manchester and it was a bunch of rough kids walking around with babies because they give them, um, they give them a house if you have a kid. So there's 16 year old girls everywhere with baby baby. I'm pushing the pram, socialize, socialization. It was pretty funny to watch this young chicks everywhere. Kids and red hair. That's weird. I didn't know that. It's a, that was like our families there as well. Socialist ideas. I mean there's, there's, there's good things to it. Like healthcare. I really think that's one of the big problems that we have in America.

Speaker 2:          00:54:26       And they try this good, like the way they're fixing that in America. It's like fucking up even more. Obamacare and the affordable care act, it's got so much, so many people are angry about it. But, but I think that the principle behind public health care should be that. That's like one of the first things that a government takes care of first things that a society or civilization takes care of me. What should everybody have? Well, everybody should have access to healthcare. I mean she'd be like one of the first things. It shouldn't be that everyone has to go by it though the day of they force you to go buy it. I mean it's this weird sort of, you know, we have the money to, to start wars and finance these overseas campaigns, but we don't have enough money to take care of the health of the citizens based on the tax revenue that we generate.

Speaker 2:          00:55:11       And I think that's just crazy. Well, you guys, you guys have to keep crap job's just to keep your health set care right. Sometimes many people, too many people take and keep jobs just specifically for their health. Takes advantage of the health care system in Australia. That's for sure. Back to the whole of Australia have gone up because it'd be fucking bull riding. So back to the thing. So you, you have all these fucking cush concussions for three big ones, three, three out cold from motorcycle riding and you decided to go into Moitai um, tell them what you want it to do in between then and why you got into Moitai. So basically I decided to join Israeli hobby. We've got family over there as well. And this school I went to, some of them decided to go over there. I was dating Israeli girl as well. I thought I'd go to the Israeli army and I was 18. I thought a good joint would be a good experience cause my dad was the paratrooper dog unit in South Africa. So I was like, hell yeah, this is, this is the brains of, yeah. This is the sort of, the thing is, is this girl's moment convincing him to go to the Israeli army romance decent. Israel is very romantic

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       and meanwhile she's moved to Australia, so her daughter doesn't have to go to the fucking off the charts, get a baby for sure. If I go down, it's like, so that's why you, so how do you join the Israeli army when you're living in Australia and you're Australian citizen? Born in South Africa. It's voluntary. It's voluntary. So they'll take anybody from a Jewish background. Um, it's voluntary. You could join the Israeli army. So you're from a Jewish background, that's all you need is correct. It's all your name. That's all you needed. Wow. Really? Diversity. Oh really? It's up to three years of pretty active duty. So you go over there, you're 18 you join the Israeli army. I didn't quite make it there, so I told my parents and my dad was, tell your parents. That's the whole point of the story. I told them that three days before it's going.

Speaker 5:          00:57:13       Why did you tell them? I'm terrified of my dad. He's like the nicest guy ever to just went out of the, I said that. Um, yeah. And they're like an eight. I'll go ahead and get the big guilt trip. I cancelled it. I had a plane ticket. I'm like, screw this labor ready. I mean he's a couple years older than me, so like screw this, I'm going to go to the toilet. They want the same ticket. My parents like, you're going to Thailand, we're paying for him to go with you. I went as a chaperone, all expenses paid first night we arrive there when straight to seven 11. Got a massive bottle of Samsung. It's a tie whiskey and just got like absolutely drunk off my head on um, coach San Road Bangkok, which is like a bad area, but it's not a bad trash. It's, it's a, it's like the Vegas trip friendlier.

Speaker 5:          00:57:58       You know, it's a bunch of cuts friendlier than the Vegas trip. Well not if, well look, it's, it's basically backpackers central. Um, everybody's very friendly cause they usually straight out of school and they're free and the way they're fisherman pants and drinking and smoking cigarettes going there just for vacations. Gross. Oh city. Okay. So lovely. So, but you're not alone. There's probably a bunch of other people drunk like that too. They got him drunk. Yeah, I got, I got the, the the ironic thing that got drunk or the corner with the homeless Israeli guy. Yeah. It was the funniest part of all of them in a lot of Israelis. That's hilarious. So then ever since then I was like, man, I love this, this fighting business. Like I was ready boxing's does young liberals do Jiu Jitsu? Obviously I looked up to him or I was doing Moitai and thought I was good at it and then he got 10 times better than me.

Speaker 5:          00:58:44       I was like screw this man, I'm just going to live here. And just kind of kept going back and loved living there. And what will, what was it that like forced you to like make that decision? Like, what, what, what triggered in your mind to like, Yo, okay now one more tie fighter. Yeah. Look, I've been at school wash. Dot. You know, I did so much struggle at school, but you know, I have add share on 80 days. It's even remotely interesting. Yeah, it is struggling. I thought, you know, like all the be something good and boy wasn't established in Australia yet. Like there was no wind power was still

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       very good. But it's something that you sell in Wales is a video on the thread on the underground. Um, I mean on a message board of him fighting, pull it up so we could put it on while we're talking. Yeah. Yeah. It was a video of you finding out my message. It is a world championship title fight. That's the one he got no to ask him about that actually that was the second time and his whole career he got knocked out. Like to actually watch yourself. And I've watched this a few times when we find in there. Yeah, that's Sunny d from New Zealand. A really good fighter. Um, this was actually, I was still getting told to this day some of the people's favorite fights because we kept dropping each other in it. And, um, this is quite an, that's my coach Nick Stone. Um, yeah, I just didn't have a good eye, good training camp for it.

Speaker 4:          01:00:09       I just, you know, it was kind of a, I wouldn't go that look, it's, I was getting, I had too many coaches, whereas, you know, I should have had one that we've looked everything. And you're getting contradictory information. Is that what it is? We didn't really like the prom was with moisture in Australia and he's got to coach Nick Stone who is a brilliant coach, but it's, um, you know, we had a bit of boxing, a little bit nutrition, a bit of this, a bit of that. And it's, it wasn't how we coach our students. It was just basically do a little bit of boxing, a little bit of running wish for the best. Like it wasn't, you weren't totally organized that were saying, yeah. You know, I can always go back and forth between Thailand's he know the tires like no, no, no, you kicked like this.

Speaker 4:          01:00:48       And he'd come back to Australia and off. Fuck this guy. What was the difference between the way the ties told you to kick and the Australians told you to kick? The tires are more dominant in clinch elbows, knees and kicks, especially clutches. What I love the most about Whitesides is my favorite thing. Um, whereas Australia and you generally find like Sun even out, I'm just watching the video now is very well known for his hands. So the whole career only took about 12 to 13 hits to my head in all my flights. Real was wasn't someone, if you watch and again 12 to 13 hits ever to your head, how's that possible? Many you have? Oh, 34 34 fights in only 12 to 13 hits to the head. I like to stand when you say that.

Speaker 4:          01:01:34       Right. But um, it's gets really excited. Get around my tie. Fighters take much less damage than boxers. Um, it depends. Um, you know like I really a lot of the articles in the MMA forums and stuff and these guys coming out saying the damage is getting done in the training. It's not getting done in the cage. Right. For me, my trading Thailand, we don't even really spa. We do a lot of clinch, a bit of play spidery lot of pad work, a lot of groundwork. Well they have a down more, you know in my opinion is about MMA sparring. The real problem is that MMA in America and MMA as a sport in general, it's still very young. It's a very young sports and there is a lot of people that got into MMA that really did not know how to properly train for striking.

Speaker 4:          01:02:22       Absolutely properly trained as far as like what kind of damage you do long term. If you spar really fucking hard all the time and it looks as always have had a history of, you know Jim was and much. Yeah. See the thing is like when, when Americans went to Thailand, they saw the ties training and they copied it and brought it back. And this has happened in Australia a lot. Um, it's one of those flat to constant watch you when you stop, that's what happened. Yeah. Sounds sick. But um, the problem is that they watched the ties to it. And this is like anything, when you go overseas, you do yoga, you do [inaudible] whatever art you're doing, cooking, whatever it is, right. And then watching the Thais do it and the ties go pads, bag, work clinch and that's it. So the Americans had come back in a strength come back and copy of that, but they forget the ties don't spar for one reason.

Speaker 4:          01:03:08       They fight every weekend, you know, so from a young kid so they don't spoil. Why would they spar? That's right. So right. So I mean, I think like, um, that was lacking and clinch is really lacking in western countries. But um, ties don't, if you watch him fight, have you been to Thailand? Jury? No. You going to watch them fly around the fourth round? If one guy has one, they stopped fighting in the fifth round so that they can fight next week. They know who's one already, you know the first round that I go hard. They don't dry elbows for the first round. Normally there's a lot of that sort of stuff in India. They go slow in the first round. Is that because they also want to place bets? There's big part of the adrenaline adrenaline. Well, because the adrenaline will take a bit to kick in like two.

Speaker 4:          01:03:51       Um, I, it's like the plum harm down and find your rhythm. Look, the problem with Thai boxing is like he's been, how long? How many times have you been 26. 26 times. I've been about seven. 16, 17. It was on about our 10th trip that a tie actually explained the rules to us. Saxon. Yes. Sex Saxon. Right. And it's like [inaudible] no, I wish, but no, that's that. He's an, he's an American and Axon is a, the name of the gym sessions. A guy he beat, um, you know, some core, some cores, like the best kicker in Thailand. He was just, hey look, a, you become the best kicker at Tyler. Oh some cores whose country is known for a while. But this guy explained the rules to us and we're thinking Jesus like Ooh, beautiful. Knocked down. By the way, that was not illegal for people that actually lived in Thailand and kept saying it was illegal.

Speaker 4:          01:04:39       Why was it illegal as long as long as you throw the cake before they're down, you can kick. Sometimes they land on the ropes, he can still hit them as long as they didn't hit like the floor. Oh I saw that. Its critics out there. But what was the point of this? To me down, we're tight. Thai, Thai boxing. One of the misunderstandings, people don't, they don't understand like you know the ties, they won't fight in the fifth round. They won't use, you know, elbows usually in the first couple of silicon cottage and then the, and that was illegal right here. Bridge from this fight. Really one shot to the back of the head while you're down. Um, yeah you were down. Totally mucked style. It's in how got a little bit dirty.

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       It happens again. Wow. Side of Brady. Everybody try it. I remember going to the hospital for awhile and this was the fight that convinced you to stop fighting. I had a one or two flights health to this and yeah, no big deal. Just a brain hemorrhage. Yeah. Wanted to fund. They have to drain your brain. No, no. It was only a small blade, but it was enough to, yeah, you look like you're certainly a wobbly here. Oh, I keep going. Damn. The thing about about it, this fellow that is, man, it didn't have to be this way, like if you didn't get hit on the back of the head and then again being dangerous. You know what I mean? Right. I like it. It's, I hate to say like when people hear us say that it's the sport and Moitai. Is Jen really quiet, pretty safe compared to boxing or rugby?

Speaker 2:          01:06:03       Rugby's a horrible smell. Love sport by them. And how is it safe when you're dealing with head kicks and Shins and knees? I mean, how many head shots have you seen this? Oh, he dropped him with a head kick. This is a crazy fight, man, that could fuck holy shit to get dropped like that and get punched in the head while you're down. Then get punched in the head again and dropped and then dropped him with a head kick. And then I think he wasn't cheap back of the head again. But it was only when I kind of went down. Oh. So I think this flight had changed to South Pole. That's coming of at one of my lady flights were changed to South Pole. It's wild. Um, so the difference in the way the ties fight being that they fight like almost every weekend and then they train.

Speaker 2:          01:06:43       But even their sparring, they don't go at it full blast. Like the Dutch who don't fight as much as the ties, they throw hard kicks to the legs into the bodies, but they throw light or punches to the head. He says, we were in Holland about a year ago training at MIT at all. I wouldn't say which Jim, but um, men that's, there's a punching each other's heads through the wall. Oh Man. Especially when the jet, um, I was maturer ratios. Jim's crazy. That's a great gym by the way. If you have it, go there. Have you been there? No. Well there's the used to be a Magiro gym in Encino as a Guy Shuki from Magiro gym and uh, Holland came to America. He was here for a while. He's an Israeli as well. Uh, he went back to Israel though. Well, anyway, go to the locker room and just be prepared to keep your eyes facing straight.

Speaker 2:          01:07:25       Yes. There's group showers and everybody's naked guys and girls talking and chatting after training. We weren't ready for that. Yeah, wouldn't you be ready for that next to none of the guys would go shower together as great. Beautiful. Back to the garden of Eden. What? We weren't ready for it. Wow. That's cool. So she's a kill each other and trying to know. So how did you decide though, like that you were okay doing this? That was a beautiful head kicked man. How did you decide that you were okay doing this after like retiring from motorcycle racing because of concussions? I mean, you weren't worried about these concussions like this. That's some bullshit right there. Like I hit you aren't, that should have been the end of the fight. Yeah, I kept going. There's another one coming up. Um, but look, I can't take it away from this sky to get off topic cause he, Sonny is a top flight. Oh, he definitely is. But he's

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       also, if he's a dirty bitch, I not going to lie. Doing actually has a lot of respect for him. I woke up for about three months after this fight dreaming about strangling. Oh, that was the first fight. He's a lovely guy. Everyone tells me I get up every morning. I woke up dreaming. I was just like, squeeze it. You hit him when he was down to payback bitch. Crazy fight, man. That's a crazy fight. This is the first time you really got hurt and your whole career down in Jamaica on a big show, but not so dehydrated. We were like, oh yeah, my coaches are going to be one 35 pounds. I'm like, Oh yeah, 62 kilograms. I get there. And Stevie Kennedy's, uh, one of my coaches as well. He's a heavyweight. Um, I'm thinking, you know, one 35 pounds, it's probably around 61 62 didn't think about it and get there.

Speaker 4:          01:09:05       I'm like, shit man, I got a cut. Like I swear to you, end up 58 killers. It was like 58.7 or something and had to get done. I don't even know what the weight was. I was like, 64 kilograms is Jamaica. Wow. Pounds. How many kilos it was, you're talking about you're talking to eight kilos, eight kilos off. How's about five or six? Six, seven, six. Let's say six. So six is, is 2.2 pounds. Jesus Christ. And back then we didn't like, you know, we didn't know many of the cutting methods to sit at the site for five hours saying about sang about this. You know what? I'm sure it's the same for you with everything you do. Like we didn't, we now, the way we coach, how we didn't know back then or how we want it to be coached. So we just didn't know, you know, so he'd just go jump in a sauna suit.

Speaker 4:          01:09:52       And so what we did. You just did it. Yeah. There was a lot of really bad weight cutting it in the UFC back in the day. I used to cut weight to fight in taekwondo tournaments. I cut the day off. I would get down to 140 pounds the day of the fight and he's going off my hair. 1617 yeah. It was terrible for a very dangerous they will. That was the thing about boxing while they changed it to a Wayans the day before the fight because they give the fighter a chance to rehydrate. The big issue was brain injuries too. Dehydrated fighter or more substantial. Of course I found out that almost all the deaths and boxing came and outside of the heavyweight division in the heavyweight division, there was no deaths. Yeah. That's one of the things he attributed to. This is not cool to watch. It's one of those flights will be the greatest fight ever if you weren't the guys probably I made the best highlight of this.

Speaker 4:          01:10:39       It was just me hitting him. If we don't have to watch it again. It's cool. It's cool cause you can keep going cause I want to ask good questions but um, yeah, there's a theory now they're saying that. And I was saying to one of my guys, because we just went to the UFC and he cut about five pounds and everyone keeps saying you need to drop down a weight division. Right? Yeah. This is not cool. That's it then that was not cool. There's the end of the fight. That was the back of the head shot again. How's it going? We can kill off Jim. What's your view on that? Sorry. Um, so that you fired two times more after that. How many, how many MMA fights or excuse me, I'm more Thai. Did you have total

Speaker 5:          01:11:15       I had a couple of like, um, you know we kept my record down cause I was fighting to Thailand a lot. So if those guys, I've never been passed around to hit Thailand in 1617 flights everywhere. So all up we, we found a lot of tapes and probably about 30, 34. Yeah, there's a lot of fun. Dodgy towards the end. Yeah. I started finding bigger ties and just like, there's some, there's some good ones on youtube of I'll be fighting is twice a year. I dropped him like 15 times the Calbert get tropic. Those guys just keep getting back up. So I don't know. I didn't really, it didn't bother me fighting tonight. You've got little kids, eight year olds that are fighting and it makes you feel, you know, in Australia when it fought, it's like you go backstage, got to rev yourself up.

Speaker 5:          01:11:57       You've got all your friends. There you go. You know, it's the crowded, it's music. Thailand, there's like eight nine, 10 15 year olds all sit in the back with him. Mommy's taping the hands. You watch them fight for, I taped their own hands. That's right. Yeah, yeah. You know, they, they fight for like 15 minutes. You're like, oh, this isn't so bad. You know? So it was pretty more relaxed environment, easier going into the fight. Absolutely. Playing as well. And I was normally in the main event being like the Westerner and I started finding some really good tires to subcu. Really started towards the end. Getting a little bit dodgy like cause ties are very proud people and other very similar Japanese like that. And they started kind of slipping in the bigger dude's and snapping in the, there was one fight actually showed me where he was actually winning.

Speaker 5:          01:12:39       And you throw me just to get his shoulder, but it was a bit scary until then. Kicked me in the head is a big boy. So when you say bigger dudes, you mean like the wrong way class outside of your weight class? Like ringer's ringer's after a while. Are they bigger than you? The legs. They're trying to set you up. They didn't really, they didn't really weigh you do though. Now we here anyway. I just, most of them, most of them were either weight or heavier earlier on. They used to Ab bits. Um, yeah, later on they're just kind of all about my size or bigger, which I was okay with. It was still good fun. Wow. So you far over there for many years and were you there when the tsunami hit? Yeah, so excuse me. Um, basically the story with this, um, I don't think I even written this online, but basically, um, we wake up and Yanks who actually the other side of Thailand and um, my brother and I and Cobain Yang and I was still staying there for quite a while, having some fights and my brother's like, listen man, I'm going back to Sydney call say cup or a bit of money on my Kia suede.

Speaker 5:          01:13:44       Like I had so much in my bank. I was like 20. And he went and took it and he entered the pin card role. So he entered the pin number wrong when you put the card in. And I was like, great, such swallowed my car. I was like, I'll fucking great. So I'm stuck here in Copen Yang, which is like the full moon party, like crazy party island. And I had to wait like four days to get a replacement card. In that time, my friend had two doctors that lived in Melbourne, Glen and Tom and I met them a few times. One time. I said, listen, you guys go to PP island, you go to the other side of Thailand where we wanted to spend years in Christmas. And I said to him, well, you guys go there and I'll meet you over there. I've got to wait from our placement cuddle still.

Speaker 5:          01:14:23       Therefore a couple more weeks, I'm sorry, a couple more months in Thailand. So they went over there and then it's tsunami hit. So in a way I kind of miss it and army because of my brother. So I'm like, okay, well like screw this, I'm going to go look for them. And we didn't know what actually happened because the media is often run by governments and we didn't really know what was going on. So we had ours a bit of a wave and um, yeah, basically where there's a bit of a wave and you know, I thought, oh, we'll try help out. I'll go look for my mates. So I could, I got a friend, um, to write entire saying, I'm head of the Australian Search and rescue. So I went over there with a, another South African friend who I'd met who is now a very good friend of mine. And they're like, okay, cool.

Speaker 5:          01:15:06       You guys are in charge of um, pick up. The bodies were like, yeah, this is just fucking great. Yeah. And we've got more involved and you know, there was those 1500 bodies when Ppi island, we, it carry all of them. There was just a couple of volunteers and stuff. Wow. And then after a couple of weeks we're like, well, we tried to do a few other things. Um, you know, we, you know, those things, they wanted us to start cleaning up because a lot of disease on the island because of the buyers, because of the body. So then the animal study eating the bodies as well. Oh. So bodies would be washing up, you know, all the time. What kind of animals? Um, what actually happened during the tsunami was in Ppi on its flat. It has got two hills on the other, on both sides, and that the animals must have detected.

Speaker 5:          01:15:50       There's a lot of articles on that, on the Internet. I detected that the slammers coming in and they actually all went into the hills. So there was like, do you like dogs, cats, birds, whatever. Um, there's a goat. We found running around, like loosened a lot there and I was doing, um, they started in the bodies and then they got sick as well. How? It's only a small island. Um, and those, you know, I was like, how big are crosses it he'll walk from one side, you hover, it's not, it's not that big. But um, yeah. So, and then I was like, well shit, I bet it's keep looking for my friends. So we went through the bodies with, through the pictures in the morgue, went to the morgue. Meanwhile, these two, two monkeys, they're both fun. They're both doctors. And I actually had gone across to PB on, it's a bit of a trip, you know, like ferry, bus, ferry, two monkeys, none.

Speaker 5:          01:16:34       I if I, two, two friends that are doctors, you don't really mean really monkeys, monkeys. We came tongue. Um, and basically they met some girls on the bus across and into, stayed in hotel. And I don't know what the hell they were doing. So I'm looking for them in the tsunami and I pick up bodies and do all types of crazy things we probably shouldn't have. And um, and they were just on the mainland hang out with these two girls so it all where they there to find them and they'll just chilling out. Um, but you know, Alisha, I suffered a lot of, um, not so much, but more so, uh, post traumatic stress off doesn't it? 20, 21. Um, yeah and stuff. A lot of post traumatic stress and um, you know, it ate that much and just from the bodies will PTSD. He wasn't really like talked about as much as the stage, you know, like I, I felt like I was a warrior as I call it.

Speaker 5:          01:17:27       They're not talking about this. Yeah. To be fair, my mom was like, don't even think about going over there. And I was like, yeah, hell no, you don't. No mom, don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Yeah. When straight straight over there. And we had some cool experience. Like every day I could write a book on the things that we did and what happened. And that's the idea actually. Yeah. When you say post traumatic stress, like specifically, like what, what was the feeling like what did you, what was the issue that you had from seeing all that horrific shit? Um, look, you know, I mean folks were actually what happened when I came back, my prints split the day I got back from the tsunami, so they split and my brother and I would just in the house alone. So, um, I dunno, like, you know, we'd be what?

Speaker 5:          01:18:07       She was a bad boys two as your favorite movie. Yeah. I love that close to there. He loved that. Wow. You really did get hit in the head a lot. It's cool man. Um, yeah, bad boys two and you know, we'll see the bodies in this way. You're like, everybody's there much sick. Will Smith so bad boys two, what would happen those, that same with the morgues and stuff like that and bodies and yeah, like a little bit of a flashback and yeah, that, it was just kind of hard. It wasn't something I talked about. It wasn't something I was proud of. I was like, Oh man, I put everyone out. You know, I probably shouldn't have done that. And they're a bit of guilt as well where you only told me some of the stories, quite recently talked to him about it. That's one of the reasons I, um, I put that post up because we were so busy in Sydney.

Speaker 5:          01:18:51       Everything's always moving, moving, moving. We never actually sat down and talked about it. All I know is he had some trouble, you know, and we see each other every day, you know, but just, it's never just come up in conversation, you know. So today on the way here we were talking into the plane stuff or toy and I'm like, I've never heard of these stories. Has some cool stories. Yeah. Which is strange. It's strange I guess. But uh, that's what it is for a 20 year old. I think it kind of, I grew up very quickly and I went back to Thailand a lot since then. Um, yeah, those, those cool experience. I later, like now I've been working for the customer, we rescue team for about three years now, so I'm the only Westerner that does it. Only idiot. Yeah. What is the rescue team?

Speaker 5:          01:19:31       What does this in Koh Samui they've got private ambulances and then they got volunteer and there's the rescue teams of like a boat flips or there's a car crash or local sick or someone dies or there's a lot, you know, there's a lot of black acts and stuff, you know, we go click, the bodies are lingered on Westerners. Yeah, we go like patch him up and take him to the hospital and it's a bit of everything. You know, there's a fire where they're like, we kind of Gi Joe kind of rescue me, but I'm the only Westerner. So that led to that later on and I've had some pretty cool experiences for three years now. Just working a couple of shifts a week with the Thai team. And you one shift of

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       probably the hardest shift I had was last February when I actually decided I'm going to retire and the cord limb of sendlane retire. And I was like, if I'm gonna retire and have to try that much. So I spent a lot of time doing the rescue team and over the full moon party on the island up from us in one shift from 11:00 AM until the next day 11:00 AM those like 30 accidents we attended. Yeah. So it was pretty, it was pretty hard to get published, you know, as well. We're not really allowed to talk about all of it, but most of it's, you know, western is drunk. Westerners just being stupid. And I meant there's a girl, um, I think his sister is Nicole Fitzgerald and her a young sister, Kate and Nicole. Um, it was on the back of a bike and I don't know if there's a western a and got hit by a truck and she died and now I know she promotes safety for, for riding and transport in the Asian countries because a lot of like a lot of Australians are dying folio flag balconies and p kit and to stupid stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:21:09       Just being drunk and [inaudible]. Yeah. Thailand's amazing. Make it sound worse. Like, this is the worst part of it. It's amazing place. But people just go there and it's um, you know, the ties are lovely people, beautiful people. Very patriotic. Like if the king of you don't talk badly about their king, if you're going to have a pension, they king or you've been to the movies there and what happens? You have to stand up and king for the king. It's like 10 minutes and one west and I'm an idiot. Um, refused to stand up and they just, of course warm happen would happen. Like, um, don't know what happened. Exactly. I just know he was taken away. Basically. They'd beat his ass. Yeah. I mean they're not, they're kind people. So I don't know if they'd beat his ass, but they would have find him or arrested him.

Speaker 4:          01:21:52       You don't know. Wow. Just for not standing up at the movie theater for the king. I think he got arrested. So talking back to their country folk, everybody who goes to, you know, like right now you go there and you go to these places and the key with going overseas and you've traveled quite a lot of, of course we travel like a lot. When you go to someone's country, you never go to the place where Westerners hangout. I don't want to see Aussies, I don't see ties at deal with Ozzie's cause the ties that deals with deal with Aussies, they get that red. I'd look and you know, they get, it's just a little bit like they're not, they, they become, I'm jaded. Right. So it's just like, um, you've got to go to their country and respect it. You know, if you go to Thailand, then you must, it's an amazing place.

Speaker 4:          01:22:36       Don't go to an area where ties have to deal with Westerners because then you've got to deal with the tires that have to deal with the West. Well that's, I mean, Hawaii is a part of America. Um, but that's the, the argument that you always hear about Hawaii is how the hate Americans, but it's just because they're dealing with Douche bags all the time. I mean, imagine the fucking idiots that you have to deal with that are always on vacation coming from all parts of the world and they're all drunk and they're all, uh, you know, entitled because they're spending so much money to get over there to act like you should give a fuck about them. You know, I've met people that are Hawaiians in Hawaii that are some of the nicest, kindest, coolest, sweetest people you could ever meet. But then you'll talk to people, all wines, hate Americans.

Speaker 4:          01:23:18       Like maybe some, maybe for a fucking good reason. You know, maybe they have to deal with dickheads, ties, ties, hate Israelis. Really because, and Israelis have you been to, it's a lovely place I've ever been to Israel imagined Copacabana without crime really. It's pretty much what it is. Tel Aviv your full plate. No crime, no crime. I mean the, the, you go girls, 18 year old girls with machine guns on their back, you know, at Mcdonald's off duty, you know, but wow, that's an underrated traveling places. But everyone's so scared of the bones and all that stuff. Don't worry about it. The point is they hate Israelis and Thailand. So we'd go buy a motorbike, which anyone could have any girl, Aussie girl who gets off the plane can hire a motorbike, never driven one before. And um, we go high. What are they say? Oh no, sorry, we can't lend you.

Speaker 4:          01:24:04       And we say, oh no, where Australian. They go, oh, okay. We thought you were Israeli. So, so what, what, what the reason is Israelis a nice people? It's not that, it's just that the ones that go to Thailand, uh, fresh out of the army, so they're, they're crazy. You know, like they're just straight out of the army. They've seen all this bad stuff and they go to Thailand and they just smoke weed and just go create that. Whereas they just go crazy. Basically mushrooms and everything disrespectful towards the tires, alcohol, flights, whatever, you know, loud, because they feel entitled after the army. But you know, the ties to like them go there. They're nice people. Far off for the moment. The young traveling Australians, the Russians aren't doing so good now. The Russians have like, there's a lot of Russians in coast movie and the islands in the past two years I've noticed, especially working for the rescue team.

Speaker 4:          01:24:52       I mean, tell me more and more Russia and they speak Russian, uh, mobile, Russian accidents. And because our last name is Latvian, Russian really raised a lot of us. We thought it was Russia until about a month theory, Pharaoh's Latvian. So basically a picture of a cricket. Yeah. But now, you know, when I went to hotels, um, and I can speak Thai, so for me it's like I can get around it. They see my last name raise look off and they're like, no, no, no, no, we're full. I'm like, you gotta you're blind. It's like 300 rooms. There's rooms open. I could see them really speak to them when their call and once they realize you're Australian. Whoa. Yeah. But if I spoke Thai, they kind of really take you in. Oh, do you speak Thai? Oh, it's a bit rough. And he's very, he does, he's bloody shy.

Speaker 4:          01:25:35       That's every time I said Dylan order for us to speak to untie it. No, no, no, no. He speaks. But my team didn't speak English at all. No one in my rescue team. So sometimes those misinterpretations about, you know, I did interpret things properly when they speak to me. Tired, they'd be like, go over there and you know, like I'd drive to like the other side of the island if I was, I was driving the ambulance and uh, some some, yeah. Not so funny because the one thing about, um, one thing about Thailand people don't know is that before the tsunami couldn't buy property, there are businesses, unless you are under a Thai name, so you'd marry a Thai woman or a top man, which is great. I think that's a good thing. The tile ends should be owned by tires, you know? Um, but after the tsunami, they allowed foreign in this foreign investment.

Speaker 4:          01:26:18       So if you go to [inaudible], which is where the beach was film, that's where he did his rescue stuff. Um, I just not recognizable anymore, you know, so anybody can buy a business and property there now that wasn't like that before. That's changed a lot because of that. I mean before that you've got people who have to go round and round in circles to set up businesses and brothels and strip bars and stuff like that. You know, now just give him money. You can do those Russian strip clubs in the middle. I'm a mom with Russian strippers in the middle of like clubbing areas. Yeah. It's crazy. Yeah. I mean, look, you've got to go. It's an amazing place and the people are amazing. That's small parts you know, of, of timeout. Like there's still a lot of untouched areas, especially up north. There's amazing. Do you think that it's going to change irrevocably because of this though, because of allowing Westerners to buy businesses there is that kind of fuck everything out?

Speaker 4:          01:27:03       Look, I know a lot of expats that live then I'm a lot of South African expats as well as a big ex ex pat community and it's nice there, but like anywhere, like, like my brother said, you know, there's bad areas, um, like specific bad areas and out of a whole island it's only a small area. So now I didn't really go back to them anymore. I restating that it's not exactly bad, it's just this young people getting drunk, drunk, crazy, like spring break all the time basically. When was the last time you went to spring break? It's been a long time, you know, really into it. Even when I was on spring break in college, I wasn't really into it and my dream, it seems really great place to get stabbed isn't too crazy, isn't worth going well. I think whenever you give someone the opportunity, like this is the time, it's New Year's Eve, let's go crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:27:48       Like people go crazy on their own. You don't need a big fucking a day where they're allowed to go. Crazy third party in Thailand, the half Moon Party, the quarter moon pie. And even more days to go, well, there's a lot of clubs do New Year's Eve nights. They do stand up comedy shows. For the longest time I avoided those just because I got tired of the drunk and crowds on new year's or so crazy. It just wasn't worth doing. But no telling where we spent new years top and hunting, you have to tell you, well, here's something for you. Every time we speak to an American or Canadian, we spoke to, there were these two guys that, um, the UFC, a Antonio Cavalla real nice guy and his friend monkey, who's a really good, um, he doesn't use his real name and they live up north in Canada and they hunt fucking bears and wolves. And with automatic rifles in Australia, you can only get single shot bolt action. And they're saying to me, I'm like, we're going to come next year and you guys are going to take us hunting. That's be fun. And he says, he said, uh, I said, why don't you come to Australia and honey goes out of your fucking mind. I'm not coming to Australia. What do you mean? He goes, come to Australia and hunt. You guys got the most dangerous animals in the world. And I'm thinking like you just said, you hunt wolves and

Speaker 2:          01:29:01       bears. We the only thing that Brown snakes [inaudible] south Wales, so there's no crocodiles. Where are the crocodiles there? Up in the northern is and stuff. You've got to be careful. You don't step in a puddle there hiding underwater, terrifying scene where we are there. But the thing is for us, like the scariest creatures and sees a is a brown snake, which is deadly, but they don't want to be there if you're hunting and bloody Canada that bears and polar bears, if you keep going up, you know, bears and wolves of wall tacos whenever any that attacks us. Yeah. Well the, so the crocodiles there are limited to one part of the island. But what about the water? The swim. Yeah, but I mean you're talking about, we're talking about like Bush hunting, right? Like, like in a Bush, right? But, uh, but swimming up on the top side of Australia yet, don't just have to worry about sharks.

Speaker 2:          01:29:56       You have to worry about crocodiles, crocodiles, and outreach. And what part is that? What is the, the up above Queensland, Queensland sort of upper along. Yeah, there's not much up there. Have you guys seen that guy who's a claimed to be Jesus in Queensland? It's become a fairly famous on the Internet. There was a internet expo's a about, um, some, uh, I believe is a British guy. Went to a Queensland and talk to this guy. He's got a huge colony of people up there. That belief he's Jesus. He's got some woman with him that he says Mary. So she's a whore. Well, you know, she's a reincarnated horse or I don't think her herself, but a, apparently, uh, this guy's a causing a stir up there and people are hoping he gets eaten by crocodiles. He's got a good chance as long as the puddle around says that bad.

Speaker 2:          01:30:43       Um, in terms of the policy, I mean, look the [inaudible] or anything like that, right? Like a bear, you could probably run around a tree, like a black bear. I Dunno. I've never seen one. We're looking at doing is actually doing three. No, I'm saying as in like a blackberry. You could probably shoot it or climb or something. Right. Not at, not a brown bear. At the smaller ones, you know? You know how fast a black blackberry we want to go next year can literally get up a tree as fast as they can run. They go there. Just go up the tree. You're not going to out climb a blackberry. Sure. I got a good black belt. Could strangle it. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think you could. You could shoot it. I mean most of them are scared of people because we usually have guns and bows and arrows and stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:31:22       Yeah, but black bears are tricky, man. I've never seen one there. We've known they don't usually attack people. Black pairs are much more likely to run away from people then attack people if people have died because of black bears, brown bears in their hand or fucking, yeah, fire. Sorry. Grizzlies are totally different animals and happy Hopkins. One there with the bear. That's plenty chasing him around. I remember that. I don't remember the name of it. Terrified. The polar bears are the most dangerous. Really? Yeah. Because there are 100% carnivorous. The other ones are omnivores pro. Even grizzly bears are omnivores, but we'll say that, I'm sorry, brown bears hunt a lot. They'll, they'll kill moose and they chase moose and chase him down and kill him.

Speaker 1:          01:31:59       They chase antelope and or um, uh, a rather a Caribou and d or the Fonz, but they a, and they'll, they definitely kill people. They kill people every year. They killed people. Even in America every year. That's Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown bears and grizzlies essentially the same bear. Black bears are smaller but still very dangerous. But all those bears, they eat different things. They'll eat like roots and berries. But if a polar bear sees you, they just go, oh shit, I can eat that. And then they start coming at you. They all just want to eat. Anything that's moving is on the menu. But what about wolves are, they're scared. They're scared of the bears will just scary as fuck. Cause they act together. If it's scary thing about wolves as they act together, they haven't been, there haven't been very many attacks on human beings, but it's only because we figured out how to contain them and killed them.

Speaker 1:          01:32:44       They used to be a lot of them. I mean all that big bad wolf, all those stories that, you know, Little Red Riding Hood and all that stuff. That all came about because at one point in time, before the wolf populations were put under control, especially back before they had really good weapons. Wolves were a huge problem, right? During World War One, the Russians and the Germans had a cease fire because the in in the the, the, the forest, they were killing so many troops, the wolves, they ran into a super pac and wolves, a especially in like the really cold climates conform superpacs. There's also a principle of the further north you go, the larger the mammals are. That's why polar bears are the biggest bears and Kodiak bear because you, the further north you go, the more they have to maintain their body mass or to a, in order to keep heat.

Speaker 1:          01:33:27       So you have enormous wolves and they, there were so many of them that they were killing so many Russian and German troops that they got together and they made a cease fire. They said, hey look, we're gonna just kill these walls and then we'll go back to killing each other. But she's a famous incident telling me like, I was like, Whoa, whatever. Cause we got dingoes and then guys alike didn't go as a kind of like crack heads. If they kind of gang up, I'll kind of follow you. You're cutting and you know you're in trouble. Well, but dad was jogging once. He saw one Diego and he kept jogging and he still kept joking and then he sold on Fraser Island is quite a phrase on it. Nice and straight up and bring some anti Dingo weapons. Well he's just done jug on your arm. Bring red bands big either.

Speaker 1:          01:34:08       I like dog's 70 pounds, 60 pounds. They kind of like, do you guys have good, someone similar in cocktails. They kill people every now and then. The woman died a couple of years ago focusing or up in Canada. Punch. Coyotes killed her. She was 19 years old. Young Kid. Apparently a talented singer too, but the wolves that they're starting to shoot now in North America are really fucking big. Get Jamie, pull up a picture of a big wolf that someone's killed. They, they, they kill these wolves and they take pictures of him after shooting. They're like put, putting in a bear, hug hugs and hold them up. So you see how big their, you know, there are 150 200 pounds. They're fucking huge. I could never shoot a dog. You say that. But yeah, when it goes a bloody circle in you all love humans. But I'd shoot to kill me.

Speaker 1:          01:34:51       Show you the size of that. That's one of them. But that's, that's, that's a perspective shot. The wolves in front of you. It's, it's to tell, show a one of the ones where a guys picking up a wolf because there's, some of them were guys are holding up these wolves and you're like, that is fucking insane. It's bigger than a person. Oh my God. Yeah. Look at the size of that fucking thing. And they have a lot of them now in places like Idaho and Montana. They're, they're starting to, uh, to shoot them and uh, put hunting seasons on him and Ma put larger, um, uh, tag limits on him as well because they want more people to kill wolves. A lion, they're big. See, here's another one. The of that Australia, we've got the smallest, we get the bloody little spider that kills you and a snake.

Speaker 1:          01:35:33       Well, the, a lot of these are reintroduced in North America and the thing is they were almost decimated in North America. So they brought in the Canadian wolves to repopulate. And then again, here's the issue. The further north you go, the colder the weather is, the larger the animals and so that you get in these larger wolves. I mean, they're the same species technically, but it's just like, like white tailed deer. Whitetail deer in Mexico tend to only be here like around a hundred pounds. But when you get up to Alberta, whitetail deer get to like two 50, 300 pounds sometimes because it's much colder and they need to have more body mass to keep their body heat up. It's pretty, pretty amazing.

Speaker 4:          01:36:08       Australia pretty awake, like crooked. I was probably the worst. The funniest thing was Vegas yesterday. I was, I met up with a friend of a friend and shit. I was like, you know, you, your boyfriend got to come to Sydney some time like Sydney because then every like, you know, if I go there, it's just everybody wants to kill me. I've heard that way. Everything is trying to kill you. That spiders, Americans has been there. That's how, you know what, here's the thing. And she's like, Oh man, I heard about those drop bears. And I was like, Yay. Shear is, don't give that away. You don't know about drop bears there. What's the drop bear drop barriers? Um, it's a, it's a kind of a, an alternative species. A Koala bear and they hang, you know, Koala bears and they're hanging out in trees and they drop on people's heads.

Speaker 4:          01:36:53       Um, they don't know why, but for some reason the way Americans talk, they um, can you get where we're going with this fucking hate Americans? I fucking hate America. The accident. There we go. It's basically like, well, yeah, that's the drawback. Gray ones is if you pull a block on the fuck outta here. She does a real, yeah. No, that's real bear with giant fans. Black, black drop. They only attack Americans. Australia back Americans. Are you trying to keep Americans out of Australia? We may or may not be doing that. Are you guys fucking with us? It's a, I'm not sure. Come on. Are you fucking with him? I'm not sure if we say anything. I'm sure when we get back to the, when we get back to the visa section at our airport, they may take our past. How is it possible that these Koala bear, this shit is Photoshop. So this is bullshit. This is bullshit. There's something about the pitch and the smell of the American roads. It's the muscle thing about resumes. I smell bullshit. You're smelling the right thing. Okay. Why are you bullshitting people in Australia? In Australia. It's just a thing. We, everyone, every time you had made an American Koala

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       bears and less homeless, bloody useless three my life, they're making little chocolate treats. So these images with this fake teeth, it's all, it's a, it's an Australia target tourists. Like this girl yesterday, it was like, no, the terrified, you know, what about this drop bears? I'm like, are you serious bits to go online? You find out in two seconds. The first, the first thing when you Google drop bears is museum of hoaxes. Yeah. Oh, that's all we got to worry about. Our pigs are short legs and um, and pretty much um, pigs and kangaroos and they're not. Do you guys eat kangaroo here? Um, you can get it. Yeah. I mean you can get it. You can get it. Like there's exotic neat places where they'll say pretty common. There's a place that serves, you can buy lion meat that's seen by lion. I'm going to be fresh.

Speaker 2:          01:38:44       It's all going to be frozen. All of it's going to be frozen. But, uh, there's exotic meat companies like people are into like trying weird shit like zebra and stuff like that. I try go try that zebra like I had, um, I had a lot of the, the um, wait til could drive us, which is like dried sausage and built on, it's like your jerky but no a zebra. They've got everything that they do some really good stuff. Why not that this is different places that you can go in Africa where you can shoot anything you want and uh, Louis Theroux I had a whole special about it. It's really quite fascinating. Did you watch the show? Yeah. Yeah. By the way, when you had that podcast I was geeking out. Cause I, I, when I hear that guy talk I just want to hug him.

Speaker 2:          01:39:31       He's just like such a charming fellow. He's very cool. He's very interesting too. I really, really enjoy talking to my mom loves him. If you're listening to this, lily, my mum, this is APP Telle loves you. I love it. That's cool. Yeah. It was interesting having her Monica, somewhere along the line I realized that he was sizing me up to figure out whether or not he could do a story on me like Louie was. Yeah, there was, well, I think he thinks I'm starting a cult or something like that. Or you heard you heard it because he's like, I have met all these people that tell me I have to go on the Joe Rogan podcast. And he's like, they have this thing in their eye. They look a little crazy. And he's like, he's talking to call it like you had a like this conversation with me.

Speaker 2:          01:40:06       And I'm like, no man, no. If it's happening, it's not, I'm not, it's not me. We had a bunch of guys sign up to our academy. They're not there anymore, but they signed up and they said, they said, um, yeah, we listen to the Joe Rogan podcast and he says, we need to do Jiu Jitsu lift kettlebells or smoke weed. So these guys would, they bought kettlebells. These are it nerds like the dorkiest. Did you ever seen right? They bought the kettlebells. I'm pretty sure they didn't take them out of the box. And after training every day they go smoke weed in their car and like it was just absolutely what you prescribed and you'll call, ah, I'm not prescribing shit, I'm not running the call. I just wanted to state that for the record there is no called stop looking for a sign up sheet on my website.

Speaker 2:          01:40:49       It doesn't exist. But the thing I was going to say about, which is interesting about the internet, we were talking about this on the way here is like in my gym, each person or has their own kind of little, ah, okay. So for example, like most guys listen to your short right that do martial arts, but they each tend to diversify. Like one guy goes, yeah, no, I'm an institute Rogan anymore into uh, a Duncan Trussell. He's more kind of like, you know, my kind of like a tempo of vibe, you know, like, and all the kids have now chosen there their path. Yeah. It's a cool time to like for content because everything's free too. Right. You know, it used to be that if you wanted different stuff online you, well first of all was podcast didn't exist just 10 years ago. You couldn't find them.

Speaker 2:          01:41:35       And then second of all like to have different radio shows that you listen to her. It's very difficult to get ahold of cop. Like I have a bunch of Terence Mckenna recordings and Alan Watts and a few different interesting people, like a few Timothy leary things and that I've downloaded here and there from various websites. But you had a search for him. It was really hard. We still have a little CD of you like, and I remember I was saying the first time we heard your stuff, it was my friends in high school and this is like this is, this is 15 years ago or something, smoking cigarettes and listen to this crazy dude on a, on a CD, talking about little athletes go to China and stuff. That was probably like your oldest stuff, right? Athletes, you know, like the school teacher comes up to him and say, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 2:          01:42:18       There was a about the Olympics. Yeah, it was a little bit about little, it wasn't about Chinese. It was about messed it up. That's why you're the comedian. It was the most about someone going to the Olympics and then having to go to high school after they win the gold medal in the Olympics. Like math. Seriously. The teachers starts giving him shit about not doing their homework. Yeah. But the thing is that your, your standup, and probably back in the day like Bill Hicks and stuff was kind of a dirty little secret that made me sound smarter at parties. You know? And nowadays everybody listens to podcasts. It's like, it's, it's, um, it's great, which is great. Don't get me wrong. I'm just saying as an, um, there's no dirty little secret anymore. Right? Well that's the thing that people love. They love knowing things before it's cool.

Speaker 2:          01:43:00       Yeah. Like, oh, a new forest mainstream. It's all bullshit now. I don't even listen to Rogan anymore. He's all bullshit. That's for fucking people that are just now getting into podcasts. I am all about Dunkin trust now. That's what, that's what he's psychic. Ben does psychic bands like, well, I can't say bad. Well, you know what? People will do that. They'll do that and then they'll be like, they'll Ben in donkey and after a while and then they'll go to another guy and then you bought, but it's fine. You know? I look, I do that too. I get in these streaks where I, I'll get in there a certain podcast and I'll listen to only hardcore history for like six months and then I'll go with radio lab. I'll just only radio lab for three months. It's like you get annoyed at people too if you listen to them too much. Like I've heard people's like complaining about me. Yo, you poured crows change. I used to love it. No training. No. It's actually hasn't changed. It's exactly the same. It just, you listen to someone after awhile they become fucking annoying. That's why marriages

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       break up. That's why you don't hang out with the same fucking guy every day, all day. You get bored with people. It's fucking, people get annoying, man. Everything gets annoying if you have, I love cheeseburgers, but if I had a fucking cheeseburger, every dad want to shoot myself every after a why be like Jesus Christ enough with the cheeseburgers and the quality of the day. The guests has been slowly sinking. I say this because you guys are here. I had Eliza slessinger on before you and she won last comic standing and she's hilarious. How dare you? Well, you know, I think one of the keys to the podcast is that I put people on that I would like to talk to. Genuine interest is the most important thing to me and people say, Oh, you need to have this kind of person or that are more science people or more whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:44:36       I don't, I'm not interested. What I'm interested in is what I'm interested in. I'm not interested in diversifying for anybody else's ideas that way. The, the, the, the thing that I talk about is always something that I'm genuinely fascinated with and that's all I'm concerned with. And you've been promoting a lot of people doing podcasts as in like telling them to do their own podcast. Sure. Yeah, I did that with Eliza earlier. I think she, I think there's plenty of room, first of all, there's seven fucking billion people on the planet, 300 million people in this country, and the idea that you should only want people to listen to your podcast is foolish. And for what I stated before, you're going to get bored of me. You know? It's like there should be a lot of the shit you tune into is plenty of room for everybody and podcast.

Speaker 1:          01:45:18       Also. I think the better you get at something, the more you do it. And when I say the podcast is the same as it's always been, I don't necessarily know because I think I've probably changed as a human being. I'm evolving, at least I try to constantly work on myself, so I would hope to, the podcast gets better, but along the way you kind of realize that there's, there's plenty for everybody, but I'm like that with everything man. I'm like, I promote all my friends when it comes to standup comedy, when it comes to everything. I think that the idea of only promoting yourself or only pushing yourself, that's a famine mentality and I think that mentality is a very dangerous mentality. It's foolhardy. It's, it's, it's, it's stupid and it, it, it promotes this sort of desperate sort of thinking, which I think goes against the very nature of a progress itself.

Speaker 1:          01:46:07       I think it's all about helping people out. It's all about promoting ideas that you find beneficial, promoting people that you enjoy their work or their, their ideas. And I think that the more you do that, the better it is for you and the better it is for everybody. Can I see with regard to, um, like he's and my friend is starting a podcast, right? What advice? Well, he, he, he was writing a book originally that was the original thing, but running is not really his thing. All mine really. Um, do you think of podcasts is a good place to start? Fuck yeah. Stuff like that. Yeah, absolutely. Just do it. It's not hard. I mean, you don't need a set up like this where it's also a, with hammers and all that shit. All you need is an MP. Yeah. You don't need a predator, a lava lamp or a salt rock.

Speaker 1:          01:46:54       All you need is a, an MP three recorder and microphones. It's super easy to do for a couple hundred bucks. You set it up, you put it on a table, you sit around with some chairs and you talk and you get better. You do it at first and you know, you listen to them and you listen to a input online. That's a big one. Listened to what people say, Oh, you're talking over people too much or you interrupt too much, and sometimes people do things along those lines. They don't even realize they're doing it and you have to tell him, or some people, they just, they're not listening, they're just waiting for their turn to talk. There's a lot of that going on too. It's funny when you're saying that, I'm conscious of myself doing that in terms of other like, okay, hold on. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:47:32       Okay. Just hold back. Well, there's an art to conversation and that's one of the things you find out about doing podcasts. You find out about the art of conversation, about the find out about the art of when to talk, when not to talk, listening actually interacting with people instead of just trying to say you're things like there's some people that are frustrating to do podcasts with because all they're trying to do is impress upon you how much they know and spout out facts and quote people and you're like, Jesus fucking Christ. Did you even listen to what I said? You just waited until I was done. And then you spit out a bunch of quotes and shit that are not even related. You know, they're just, they have this idea that they want to get out. And a lot of it is like trying to sound cool.

Speaker 1:          01:48:12       It's a lot of ego. It's a lot. There's a lot involved that you, you find these parallels and just a normal conversation. I'm shocked sometimes when I talk to people about, at how bad people are at not Inter, uh, at interrupting people, not listening to people when they're talking. So podcasting just makes you better at the art of conversation. And the better you get at it, the less awkward a podcast is to listen to, you know, so you just do it, man. Just do it. Start it. You'll get good at it. So that's the plan. And then hard man, you guys could do it. You're hanging here easy. It's, it's easy. You guys are, you know, you're smart, you're articulate, you're easy to talk to. You're down to earth. It's perfect for a podcast. Set it up. So it does put a fucking MP, three recorder, a couple of microphones, Bam.

Speaker 1:          01:48:57       And you're off to the races. We did one, we did one on the, on else that growing downside and we recorded at 20 times before he released it. Why? Because look, we'll sit in there with my, with my friend who's a psychologist and Dylan and I were there and um, we recorded about 20 before that and it was just like, man, it just listen to yourself. And also on top of that, like he w he was very concerned how people would see him as, as a professional because he's being open and speaking his mind. He's a really funny guy. Um, Jonathan, the [inaudible] Jonathan back, he's really funny guy, but he was a bit considered, it took us about 20 times for him to stop playing a character. You know, like the hubcaps slashed Hannibal Lecter. So you got like some of a trigger to me it looks like Vince Vaughn.

Speaker 1:          01:49:42       So he's having a hard time relaxing and being himself. Yeah, well that happens. That happens and that'll, that'll be taken care of in time. You just gotta do it. Just do it after a while. You get used to it. I mean, I have friends that sucked at podcasting in the beginning and now they're awesome at it and they just, it just takes time. You figure out how to do it right. You figure some people, by the way, they fucking never get better. They'll podcast for hundreds of episodes and they still say stupid shit and jump in the wrong time and fuck up the flow of the conversation. And make it all about them. It's, it's, you're going to have that too. You're going to have guests on that are disasters that you never going to have on again. And you recognize that like while you're talking to them like, oh fuck, I can never have this guy.

Speaker 1:          01:50:26       And again, some people just not design, some people are just not fucking interesting. You don't even know why. Like what, what is it about one person's personality that makes them fascinating? I don't know. Is it honesty? Is it their, their curiosity? Is it, what is it, you know, I don't know what he's got a different thing. Sometimes I would talking before about like some people were talking about what and meanwhile I've just talked over him for the whole podcast supportive here. I want to, no, no you did. No, that's cool. Well, you guys are all interacting. It's no, it's cool. But the thing was like, sometimes it's kind of feels like people aren't ready to hear some stuff, you know, like in terms of, um, holding back, you know, and I wonder if that comes across as boring when you're trying to, do you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          01:51:03       Like we talked about some of this stuff. Some of your stories is like maybe not for, I dunno, you know what I mean? Like it might come across as not being willing to share, you know what I mean? Oh, I don't think so. You can't overthink things either. You got to just put it out and then listen to the feedback, listen to it yourself. But sometimes it's hard to see yourself the way other people see you, you know, you, you have to, and then it's also, you're gonna, it's gonna be hard, listened to the feedback because punching people are going to writeZ , Z, Z, Z, Xie fucking boring. Kill yourself. You mean it's going to be a lot of that. You're going to have to deal with that. Parents, your own parents know you're going to have to deal with that. But listen, I would think that just your stories about Thailand, I mean, just the story that you were telling me about those dealing with those bodies, just that alone, like holy shit,

Speaker 5:          01:51:52       he's telling me, you were telling me the dice. Tell me about the aiding. Remember we were told about any of this stuff. I'm at the store has a lot of them, you know, funny to me, like have a Jewish background. For example, I never ate pork. It was just what we did it. And that's a part of my religion. But like now it can't stop here. Um, you know, we'll transporting bodies off. I'm on one boat and would sit in the middle making sure nobody's jumped off the side or fell off the side and they'd would transport food back onto the island without cleaving anything. Food Day there'd be flies. And it was pretty bad. Holy Shit. I was starving. I was like, Nah, we get an 80 wheel vomiting a lot just from the smells and stuff. I was like, you know, let's, um, you know, I need to, I need some food, man.

Speaker 5:          01:52:37       I've got eight now. So I went over there, I'm like, what is this packet? There's just like flies everywhere. Might not fuck that. I'm not, not even that. And then I said, no, I've got to eat something. So I had, it's just a little packet and an $80 like this stuff is freaking awesome. So I sit to the type person, I'm like, like near right, like what is this? And like our Ni, Ni Mu something he moved or like it must be a cow, right? Some 80 of his stuff. And a man, I got so addicted to it that I got them to write it down in English and Thai for me. And then when I went to back to the main land and for many, many trips after I kept ordering the same dish, I loved it. And my friend turns around and he goes, [inaudible] when to eat pork? I'm like, it's not pork, it's Mu, it's Catholic. Moo Cow. He's ties, probably looked to me like, oh, this white guy. And I was like, Oh, you know, they're just making their sound. An animal that Lou actually translate to pork. So, I mean, eating pork for like 10 years, it, even though it was pork and it was just so much miscommunication and translation problems, there's lots of,

Speaker 2:          01:53:35       so you still thought that you were adhering to your religious practice?

Speaker 5:          01:53:38       Um, look, I probably would have ended anyway and like, you know, the prongs and stuff, but um, it was so good, man. I've never given it up. I love it.

Speaker 2:          01:53:47       Yeah. Prawns are against the shell fish. Right? And that's supposed to eat shellfish. Jews love the unlimited shrimp. A buffet. So yeah, pretty much. It's true. That's hilarious. It shrimp gets a pass, but it's just a cloven hoof. You ever had wild pork? We hunted but never ate. You can't eat it in Australia. Why not? It's the worms. They're pretty gross. So they tend the babies, they capture the babies and they deworm them and send them to Germany because they love the boys. You know, I didn't know balls were pigs for the first one or watch Abelick's asterix and Obelix. I was like, boars, I didn't have bars. What pigs? They'll like this mythical creature. Well, it's, apparently it's all the same species. I had a guy, uh, is the guy that I hunt with that's been on the podcast is named Steve Rinella book. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:54:35       Great Book. But he said it's all, they're all from the genus Seuss Grapha they're all the same thing. Is that a wild pig can breed with a, a domestic pig that sort of, they're all pigs. There's a thing about pigs that happens too. When you take a domestic pig and they get loose in the wild. Within three weeks their body starts to change. They metamorphosize their, their, their hair gets longer and thicker and bushier their tusks grow. Their nose grows. Really fascinating stuff from him telling me that's what I said, Mike, you sound smarter. Potties [inaudible] I'm like fuck up and get away with anything anymore. They morph. It's really fascinating. They'd look physically different than the pigs that you have. Like in domestic stables. They changed their appearance. Their nose grows longer, but it's really weird. They get tusks. Yeah. And that's a domestic pig. They start to look like the Lord as well. Huge, huge problem. Huge problem. We can hug is, yeah, there's no tag limits on them in California. And you could shoot as many as you want, man. You could go shoot pigs all day. So he'll say, I can't do it man. But he likes he can't shoot pigs. No, I just got in in Australia.

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       Don't should pigs. You Dog. Um Oh. And then you stab him. I can't do that. But we've got, depends where you are in New South Wales, but you can kill pigs and Kangaroos if they're destroying the land. But you're going to stand like skippy skippy back in the day. The Bush, kangaroo skippy the Bush kangaroos. Like he's, he was kinda like Mister Ed was like alien, Mister Red. He didn't talk, but he was kind of that character. Like, you know, he's a good guy. Wrestling. He was pretty much like captain America about as interesting. Like he's the, like, he was basically like a hero that didn't really do anything. Say anything too interesting. Or You like Captain America? I find a doll, but I know it's so skewed. Anyway. So skippy skippy, that's given me, so it's like lassie. It'd be, oh man, can I tell you something? You haven't seen something very Australian. So when we go hunting and the farmers want to kill the Kangaroos really hard for us cause it's like, cause it's kids grew up with skippy. We grew up with skippy. There's some kangaroos that are bigger, right? There's a red ones and the gray ones, the red ones are scary. Yeah. How big they get Taronga Zoo in Sydney. Which by the way, if you ever, did you go to yes. Yes.

Speaker 4:          01:56:58       Why would see Kangaroos in the wild? This big massive. They're the ones we see a small, if you hit one like a kangaroo people, oh Geez. You know, people would talk about Kangaroos like God, he's so cute and this and that. And they are cute. They tasted really good as well. But you know, like they, they are the roads everywhere. And you know, why don't kill wasn't even longer. It was like two, three months ago, you're reading the newspaper. Um, kangaroo went cause they jumped in front of you. Like, Dr not as, you know, they jump a lot higher but, and they look at the headlights like, oh, what's this? And then boom, he hit them. But what happens is, um, they, it went through, because the way they're built like, you know, did like he'd hits it rolls over the car. Where's this kangaroo with through the windshield at the very bottom front to back and killed the kid in the back.

Speaker 4:          01:57:47       Oh God. So like, you know, we, we, you see them everywhere on the road. Wombats and Kangaroos out about a year ago. One try to jump through the window while we were driving. We don't personally hunt Kangaroos, but it's that you can do it in a certain area. There's just too many of them. It gets board. The one thing I was going to say, I don't know, Americans probably haven't seen this and it's theirs. There was a bit of a legal thing going on in Australia, but it just reminds me of skippy. There's a show called home and away. You've seen him in a way it was very popular in England. I've heard of it. I've never seen anybody get nine or to an Irish thing anyway. There's this very wholesome character called Alpha. Have you seen this? You can, you can swear on your podcast. Okay. It's a serious load of swearing off. I can do this. True, but it's a second nature. But if we can get 'em taming the load up, alf, Ms Not Alpha, like the alien.

Speaker 4:          01:58:38       This is Alpha is like a, uh, like a wholesome sorta fatherly character on a small town show that everyone likes. Right? And, and what kind of animal is he? He's not an animal, but he is in this, we're going to show you. So there was this whole thing in Australia. What happened? Was He, um, Jamie, the name of it so he can go and look up alf Mr Doodle Burger. So basically what happened was that guide took all existing home in a waste stuff and he dubbed over it and made Alpha into this character who's basically like, I'm a serial killer slash murderer rapist that loves like Colombian, like a little Colombian lawyers. And now it's been quoted all over, but it ended up on the news because they tried to sue the guy. Yeah, that's, that's kind of a douchey thing to do, but it is hilarious.

Speaker 4:          01:59:23       And we have to show you because the Americans didn't know what we're talking about. You know, we didn't have Hollywood. Okay. This is one of them. That's how, what's the music? Oh, is this sound okay? Just a video. Well, Americans, we don't, we don't really have too many of those videos available. Probably try and look up Alf. And it's really important you have to see it because it's a very Australian Alpha awards awards ceremony and it caused a lot of problems in Australia controversy and basically your average Australian quotes it all the time. But Americans have no idea. And they quote this video, this video. So ridiculous. So ridiculous. Wow. I, I'm, I'm trying to judge whether you've got the patients for it right now. I'm not sure. But you do have to see it. It's, it's, uh, now look up, look up. So you can never kill a kangaroo. Basically. You'd never can because the guys would go with do and they eat it and stuff like that. Can we put the vibe? Oh wait, is this it?

Speaker 3:          02:00:26       I'll tell you though, in the real thing. Which instead of the fake thing,

Speaker 4:          02:00:39       no, I don't think this is it. Okay. I'll Twitter it to you guys. Check it out because it's outrageous. So, um, you, you couldn't shoot, you couldn't do the pig hunting thing because of the way they do it. Where they sick dogs. I'm an insta habit dogs and they stab at it. That's a real common way to do it. The country boys are a bit desensitized to it and then a real nice dude, you know as well. They're nice guys. But um, I don't feel like that's thing I, yeah, that's a weird way to do it. Holding it down with a dog and then stabbing in the neck. You know, you can shoot dangerous there. You sure is. But why don't they shoot him? You can't say like with the terrain it's quite, it's quite hard to follow the dogs. So then one of their dogs, it's different types of why they using two dogs. So they normally would sniff them out and he'd get the running with the dog. You don't want to use the garden case. He shut the door. So is it just such a dense terrain that you can't find them any other way? Generally? I mean, look, it's, it's, I was against it and then I, I went to the farms, I was hanging out with the guys and they, you know, like anything, they've got their own logic and you

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       know, and, and it makes sense the own rationale. The rationale is look at costs us a hundred grand last year and you know, it's basically like, look, we're growing food for people and they're destroying it so therefore we kill them. Well, they're very different than any other animal and they're also very smart and they breed all year round to help many litters of many pigs all year round. It's just a, they have a huge problem with it. In America, especially in Texas. Texas is so bad that they've allowed them to start shooting them out of helicopters when machines. Have you seen that as something fucked up? Pull up a pig man and Ted Nugent. Uh, it's a a pork lips now. Fuck though. Yeah. They sit on a fucking helicopter and they fly over these. Well, these places are literally infested with pigs. They have so many pigs in these farms and they destroy millions of dollars worth of crops every year. There's a least 5 million pigs in Texas. You've also got that. I'm show where those hot chicks and the fake boobs running around catching pigs. One point $5 billion in damage per year. I'll put 5 billion. Yeah, 1.5 billion. I mean, that's incredible. See, that's the thing. Americans get these machine guns. We've got bolt actions and see that guy? That's pig man. Pig Man has a show where he just shoots pigs all year round. That's Ted Nugent. He's an American patriot. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:03:05       Can I ask you, do you think someone can do this and be well balanced, like as a person to do what? No, I'm not talking about like just hunting. I mean as in like hardcore animal slaughter. Um, well, you know, it depends on what you're doing it for. I mean, what these people are doing with this, uh, uh, pork lips now video where they're shooting them out of helicopters. They actually have to eradicate these pigs from these farms. They are growing in population at a staggering rate and they can't control them. They, they have no other options other than hiring a hunter. So they have companies that they hire to have people come in and uh, and shoot these pigs. They bring people on and they give the meat to families. No, no, no, no, no. The hunters for the hungry. Look, they're just delicious.

Speaker 1:          02:03:55       The meat is fantastic. I shot a wild pig a few months back and I made a ham recently. I, I Brian this ham for six days and it smoked it for a day. It's delicious. I mean, it was so good. I'm going to do it again in a couple of weeks. I have another ham and a couple of shoulders. You guys do delicious. We, we, we, we do, we do barbecue. Well, but we, you guys are, I went to Kansas and Kansas Barbecue is legit. Kansas City. Yeah. There, what's the one they got that popular like, um, or don't know the name of it. There's a bunch of really good the city, but I've never heard of, you guys have got a deep culture of food here. I, it's, it's uh, we just, I was, he was a bit simple

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       at that steak on the barbecue acts. This is no joke to, you want to get some barbeque pig and taxes. This pork man, this pig man guy pork man pig man has a show now called boss Hog. He just likes and it's all about his, uh, he has a barbecue place and he shoots the pigs, then brings him to the barbecue place and they serve these wild pigs that they barbecue. Sounds awesome. So good. It's so healthy for you too. Yeah. They're much healthier animals. They're wild pigs. This is a dark meat. And they had this campaign in America called pork, the other white meat. And they would show like pork is white meat. That's unhealthy pork like right. If the pork is white, it's like anemic. It's like veal. Pork, like wild pork is dark. It's like a, a deeper red or color. Have you had it?

Speaker 2:          02:05:23       I haven't had it. It's really good. I have to make sure you cook it all the way through because the trick and osis cause I'm tricking gnosis comes from animals eating other animals that have trick analysis. So these animals could possibly get it from like a rats or rabbits or you know, anything else they eat. They eat a lot of big deer babies. They ground eggs like at ground laying birds eight 88 we've caught when eating each other. Oh yeah, they'll eat anything. Their animals, pigs are, they're smarter shit too. They see common. They see you, they hear you, they smell, you know, they fucking bolt. We so are we. So on one of the farmers, there was a whole family and he went to shoot at them and the two adult pigs ran one direction and the kids ran in the lineup and escaped.

Speaker 2:          02:06:08       And obviously that didn't talk to each other and planet, but it was brilliant. That's funny. Yeah. It looked like it looked almost plan while they are there, smartest dogs, they're smart, you know, their trick. Tricky animals and delicious and delicious Australians. We kill them and then we shipped them off to jail. I need people are smart enough to eight. The ties it Paul, I didn't know about that it worm thing that you guys can Xeloda webs of the Kangaroos as well. Six as well. Categories. Cheap meat for us. You know, like what does it taste like? It's very gay, but you gotta know how to cook up properly. Yeah, it's um, it's not the nicest meat, but it's 99% fat free. Oh, I'm sure. It's probably very lean. Oh, the strong lifters, it's promoted to them as really kangaroo meat like that. I worry because they basically, they kill it and then refrigerate it.

Speaker 2:          02:06:59       They, they ha let's not, um, fresh. It's, well, they killed it and they put it in the thing, but I, it's not like bread, you know what I mean? It's like, you know, it's some fun. It's some hunter on a farm killing Chucky and I didn't really know what the process is of it's not bread. What do you mean? You mean like as in there's no fobs with kangaroos where they kill, you know, give it health checks and then kill it and then produce it. I'm not saying that's better or worse. I just mean as in, you know, it shows up in your Woolworth's, what do you guys have? I'm not walnuts. You guys have like Metro or, uh, but um, I kind of think

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       like, you know, where, how well is this, did they have a department of agriculture or anything like that? They did. They checked them spectrum. I'm sure that you couldn't sell it. My friends who are professional Terry, who we go to the farm lot, it's got a little Thai boxing gym out there and we go be going there for a couple of years and he was a professional hunter for a long time and he's like, yeah, bull riders who got me into it. And he turned around and it's like, man, I've never eat kangaroo. Like I'd been shooting these things since I was a kid. He said, man, if you saw what was in them like and how we did it, you probably wouldn't eat it. Now that's only one person was, a lot of them had worms, but it might just be that check might just be that in the area.

Speaker 4:          02:08:16       I don't know how he got on this topic so much, but it's a good topic. Pigs, kangaroos. The thing is, funny enough I was saying or doing when we went out to the farm, you know, I'm very conscious of my diet. I'm sure you guys are too, you know. Um, we went out to the farm, the farm boys, they, they tend to not really think about diet. So they'll eat red meat sometimes and a red ball and that's all they'll eat for three days. Vegetables. I mean, they do obviously sit down and have a meal here and there, you know? But we went out there and Dylan, I was sitting there and we bought our suppliers in our little bag and you know, we had our snacks and our this and that and we were eating all the time eating all the time. Right? And the boys didn't really eat much.

Speaker 4:          02:08:55       And after a while we realized we were eating because we're anxious, we're not used to having nothing to do and we're just automatically pull out a bar and just start eating it, you know? And after a while we just started doing what the boys did. And I started thinking, man, I'm going to get sick. I'm going to feel gross and feel unhealthy. But after a couple of days, I started to realize like, I think we put a bit too much emphasis on what we eat because we ate red meat straight for four days almost. And we had a little bit of this and that. And because we weren't eating a lot of it, we actually felt quite healthy. Like as an our body adapted to kind of just doing what we were doing. I was really concerned. I was like, man, I don't feel queasy, I'm going to get constant, you know like all that sort of stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:09:36       But when you're out there and you're doing and you're just eating it, it seems like maybe we overemphasize veggies. No, I don't think so. It's certainly not a balanced diet. I mean you could get away with it for a few days if you took that on for several months. He probably traditional deficiencies. Think the funniest thing was like first time what my brother up there and I've got like my jacket on and I've got like ammunition and I've got my nice survival kit, bandage for snakes and I'm like pulling it out to check. I've got everything by tortures. Liam pulls out a, he pulls out a sandwich bag with salad. I can't eat without salary. You, you're trying to impress the farm boys man. You bring him a salad. I bought my own vegetables cause I was like, I can't eat meat without much loss, you know, crocodile bag of salad and my cucumber. Some layers. How long did that stuffs they good for? Oh we had a call for like three days or something, you know. But anyway, it's just one of those things where their diet you, my body just adapted to whatever I'd have to do. You know? That's interesting

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       man. I would think that after awhile your body would go dickhead. He need a fucking salad or to love money tokens three days up about three days. Four days. You'd be fine. Three or four days he'd be fine. I felt good actually. Weirdly, I dunno, it was just what I was eating a lot less than I normally would in the city. Like at eat, little pieces of meat, they'd kill and barbecue and eat it. And what kind of meat was it again? It was rabbit, rabbit, deer. Just getting really healthy, wild game. Red Rabbit is out of control. There's so much vitamins and so much nutrition in, in wild game too because they're eating wild grasses and wild plants that are just filled with natural nutrients. This rabid, rabid, sexually. One of the best things I've ever made and I was a bit disappointed by deer, but yeah, really good man.

Speaker 1:          02:11:17       How are you disappointed with deer? It was, look we didn't, you got to stand like we didn't hang it properly and all that sort of like Yo guys is I'll ideas a week. Cost is, you know what I mean? Like Australia's animals are a little bit wake. It don't really weighty. They're not really meeting anyway cause it's just my opinion. That's interesting. Some farm is going to punch me in, but you don't know shit about Dhea, but it's not common to get DNA. We were in Canada and there was deer on the side of the road. Walking sale. I'll walk in. Oh yeah. You can get that all over the place. Well certain places, like in Pennsylvania, there's certain parts of Pennsylvania where they change their deer hunting season to all year round. They just let people shoot them because they're fucking everywhere and they use a, they have a bow season like all year round and they do it in these areas that are like suburban areas.

Speaker 1:          02:12:04       There was a show on it and on hunting shows. Yup. Cause guys set up on, I mean it was like these estates, these beautiful homes that have these giant pieces of property in like 2030 acres and they had fucking so many deer hitting cars or cars hitting deer rather deers eating people's lawns and all kinds of shit. D eating. There are gardens rather eating the roses that they brought in these a hunters to set up tree stands in these suburban neighbors. That's crazy. They're all equivalent as a case for us because we'd love to find deer and shit. We'd have a fun day or so. It's pretty hard to find. People think we're nuts. That's a funny thing. He's the biggest animal lover you've ever bet. He's got this big dog. Ralphie loves those works for like dog charities and animal charities and then he goes hunting.

Speaker 1:          02:12:47       Yeah. Well, people have a hard time with the idea of cruelty and rightfully so. I mean I think people are scared that people are hunters are evil people that want to kill animals. But the reality is if you're wearing leather, you're killing animals. You might not do it with your own hand, but you're doing it. You're sitting in a chair right now that's covered in murdered animals, guests. I've had vegans sitting that was very chairs that you said it again, rest there, but on, on murdered cows. You know the shoes you wear, the belt you wear. And then on top of that, if you buy organic vegetables and you think you're, you're away from your heels, they fucking run machines over those vegetables to collect them and they're chopping up a lot of rabbits, a lot of mice. The more animals are killed, more animals are killed per pound of vegetables that are killed per pound of meat.

Speaker 1:          02:13:33       A hug. What? What is it about vegans that we'd just love pissing off a Taser and man, it says something about, well there's self righteous and there's also this, this moral high ground that they like to take and not all of them. Some of them are super cool. I've met a lot of really cool vegans, but some of them are really fucking annoying and they want to tell you that they're better than you because they're Vegan and they want to, they're proselytizing to, they're always trying to get other people to be Vegan. And this just by the way, this straight Vegan diet, not that healthy. Yeah, I'm divorced. Diet is a better diet, you know, and I'm divorced also. You can eat shit like eggs that have no animal cruelty attached to him whatsoever. I have organic eggs cause I have chickens that are pets.

Speaker 1:          02:14:11       I picked my chickens up. Yeah, I have 14 chickens. I could pick them up and hold them and they give me eggs every day as my left. That's what he wants to do as my left. And there's no cruelty involved at all. I mean they lay eggs every day. They don't have, I mean there's no potential whatsoever that egg ever becoming a chicken. The only way that egg can become a chicken as if you have a rooster, so we only have hens, so the hands hanging out. They have a good time. They have a big yard to run around on and they eat bugs and worms and everything they find in in grass as well. And then also we give them chicken food. That's a healthy actual chickens. No, you wouldn't kill it. I would, yeah. I almost killed one of them. One of them peck my daughter in the face and I, I came real close.

Speaker 1:          02:14:52       My wife was like that little bitch. She did it again and I was like, all right, let's do it. I was ready. I was just trying to figure out how to do it. I had to, I was going online and it was almost like the chicken figured out that we were going to fuck it up and it completely backed off of all of its aggressive behavior. It's like a totally felt the vibe. It was really weird, man. It's like I was seconds away. I bought an ax, I was ready to rock and roll. I was completely ready to, uh, to cook this chicken up. I'd love, I've innovated the fresh chicken like that. I, I, well I was assumed that it's a lot like other things that you are organic and fresh. They just taste better. The eggs taste way better when you eat organic fresh eggs.

Speaker 1:          02:15:31       They just, they're the, first of all, the Yolk is very dark. It's a dark orange. It's just healthier. It's very healthy. I ate seven of them this morning. Yeah. Seven. Yeah. I eat them all. I six, seven eggs a day. Yeah. Hit Him all the time. You know, the funny thing is we were forced vegetarians for the first is what do your family want you to be? But Dad was big into karate and you know, like the credit guys that have this kind of like, they follow different, you know, like the catch onto a set philosophy and he's whole thing made sense. It was just about full words. Now look, he just, you know, he thought he read all these books and there was no internet back then. And, um, you know, he had this idea that you know, too many hormones in the meat, which he's right, you've been to Brazil and have you ever seen a chicken breast in Brazil?

Speaker 1:          02:16:16       It's about the size of this table. You know, like it's, and you see all these homeless dudes walking around and they look like they're bodybuilders. But you know what's interesting, there's a misconception about chicken breasts and it really is, I'm not that they pump them up with hormones. Cattle is what they use hormones on, but chickens, it's just breeding, right? Just bread, larger breasted chickens until they, they, you know, only genetically select the larger breasted chickens. And to the point where these chickens, they're so large breasted that they can't fly. You know, chickens can fly, they don't fly for very long, but they can fly for short distances. Like my chickens, they have roosts and they can jump up to the roost. They flub them about when they fly up, up to the roof and then sit there. But these chickens aren't going nowhere. They're fucking giant fat, tits chickens.

Speaker 1:          02:17:02       And, but it's, it's genetic selection more than, than hormones. Not that chickens haven't been shot up with hormones before. Right. With chickens, it's more antibiotics that they have to deal with because they're on top of each other and they getting sick all the time and they're also feeding them chicken. It's like they're feeding chickens, chickens, they're feeding them chicken shit and chicken heads and chicken assholes. If you feed him healthy diet, the omnivorous diet that a regular chicken eats, you get healthier and you get healthier animals. Yeah, I feed them only grass. I mean they, my chickens eat natural things like that. They find when they go out and pack and they forage in is I have a big yard and they run around the yard and they kill bugs and stuff and then we feed them. We also feed them table scraps, so they eat like beef.

Speaker 1:          02:17:47       They'll eat, they'll eat. They'll, they've eaten deer before I fed them pork, right? They do. Yeah. Yeah. They approached me and he do. When you go home in Thailand, like there's no, you don't see a lot of chicken. It's chicken and the food, but it's mainly for Westerners. But the ties will have their own chickens. What do they do with them? They go fighting chickens, chickens on TV. It's it behind so no one can see, you know, like oh quick, someone's coming in. The white people would come in like put in your cage, like shoving it aside. They're not the ones that the hooks on there, just like kickboxing, kickboxing, chicken flush as well. I have a friend who, uh, who does that well, he's a friend, he's a, he's a friend of a friend and he has a a hundred chickens in his backyard and he's from Mexico.

Speaker 1:          02:18:32       You know, he, he barely speaks English. I don't know why, but that makes sense. And all of his friends are from Mexico too. And it's kind of interesting. He, he, uh, he got in trouble for killing a goat and cooking it in his yard because he butchered the goat in his yard and there they were upset at him for doing that. And, uh, he didn't understand cause he's, you know, he's from Mexico and he's like, he goes, but, but you eat meat. Like if you eat meat, like what do you care where the, how the animal gets killed. I can't kill it in my yard. Like, and he, you know, they, they're told him like, there's all these regulations. You can't just kill a goat in your yard. He's like, okay, what do I have to do? I had to bring it somewhere to kill it. Like crazy. Why can't I just kill it here? There's a lot of room. I just kill his goat. Do you think we kind of lost that? It's a weird thing. Like my, my, my wife slash girlfriend weft now, I'll be ready for like two weeks ago. I got married two days before we went overseas, so she went on a honeymoon to Italy and I went, I went, I went to Canada. So I actually haven't seen her since then or it's just really random, but, but her mum can kill

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       a chicken and cook it up, like you wouldn't believe. Right. Um, she's there from a Vietnamese, she's, she's Aussie, but her mom's Vietnamese. Right. My grandma, and I'm sure your grandparents could kill a chicken skin it, they'd be, you know, make 40 dishes with it. They'd use the fat, the skin there. My Dad was telling me, well, our whole family die of heart disease. The oldest one's like 62 and he was showing their favorite dish was you'd take all the leftovers, put on a pan, fry it, skin bones, everything. Right. You'd fry them till it liquefies and then you pour it into a bottle and then dip it in. Nice. And then you take it and you just wipe it on your bread. Ah, okay. Amazing.

Speaker 1:          02:20:04       Yeah. Well like a pod tay or something like that. Well, like a fat pet. Hey, but hmm.

Speaker 4:          02:20:10       Then you're saying it was his grandma and his, they're like whole generation. They wouldn't have a problem with just skin. It use every part of its body, you know,

Speaker 1:          02:20:18       that's, that's the lost. The reason why people don't like hunting, although they do eat meat. I have friends that eat meat and we'll never hunt. They wouldn't do it. He couldn't do it. I'm like, I understand you don't want to be cruel. I don't understand. And I understand that they enjoy that separation. But to criticize people who don't enjoy that separation, I think it's kind of crazy. It's a, there's a weird disconnect, but there's a lot of people that eat meat and have eaten meat and don't have a problem with ordering a cheeseburger, but it really looked down on people that hunt. I think it's the ease. I think it's not the easiest way obviously, but I think it's the easiest on your, the ethical dilemma is the easiest because you're, you're dealing with an animal. Like that deer right there had no idea a human being was even a thing until it sauce.

Speaker 1:          02:21:02       And then it was dead moments later. You know, I shot that deer in the middle of the forest in Montana. I mean, that fucking deer was living in the wild country of Montana and it was delicious. And I had no problem with it. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. And the idea that somehow or another it's okay to, to eat a cow, but it's not okay to do that. And then other people will tell you, oh, buy only organic grass fed dear. Let me tell you. Or grass fed cows. Let me tell you something about that. I have a friend who keeps organic grass fed cows and those mother fuckers are terrified. You go near them, they run, they run and they all huddle up together. Yeah. You know why? Because they know that they're going to die and they know someone's going to shoot them and eat them. Like this idea that if you eat organic grass fed cows, you're somehow or another were removed from the cruelty. Yeah, they aren't, they aren't kept in a pen. They aren't jammed into some pig box like, like pigs are. And they do run around free and they do eat grass, but they're fucking shit in their pants. Anytime a person

Speaker 4:          02:22:00       we, we, we did some, um, city boys did some cow herding man. Northern is that fucking terrifying if you're in a pin with these cows? I mean, they don't attack humans, but they're the big, if you've ever been in a passive,

Speaker 1:          02:22:13       cows are big animals. Just crazy bitches drag riding on them. The males, remember I was like the first one I was like, he did, he did a job done, messed around and jumped on a cow too. There's a whole bunch of buck like bowls do not use the old ones, but that will run each other into a corner and kill each other. Like, you know, like this is so silly though, will they're very big. Would you eat dog? Would I love dogs? Um, if I was in another country and uh, maybe it was like for a television show or something like that and they were serving dog like fee effect, I would have a real hard time with it. Still. I might do it just to see what it tastes like and just to, you know, if I was over someone's home and they offered it to me and it was a part of their culture, I don't think that I would insult them and say that I wouldn't eat it. And if I eat pig, I mean pig and dog are supposed to be like a dog, supposed to be actually as intelligent or more, or excuse me, a pig. It's supposed to be as intelligent or more than a dog. Yeah. So it'd be a bit hypocritical. But I have a deep connection with dogs. I've had dogs my whole life and I have two dogs now and I love dogs. I love him.

Speaker 4:          02:23:18       Seven people. This guy sat me down for intervention cause you ain't gotta go. Yeah, I've got a massive French mastiffs. I love it. It's $2,000 a week, but it's a lot. Had He ogs an investment.

Speaker 1:          02:23:31       Yeah, I have a massive to do you have a regency mastiff? If it's a little smaller, they're, they're, uh, like 120, 140 pounds. This guy goes up to about 90 kilograms. What's that? 200 pounds. It's a big boy. It's a big dog, but he had a lot of joint problems. Right? Those poor dogs. Yeah. My mind starting to get a little arthritis in his hips. Not Bad. He goes, me and he's, he runs and what was the very slobbery? The sweetest dogs ever. Yeah. My, my, my dog is like so great with my kids. You know, they go over and grab his face and kiss. He's got no anger in him. The regency massive was raised to, uh, to have no human aggression. Sweet dogs, no dog aggression either. They're real good. Great with other dogs too. What was the wedding

Speaker 4:          02:24:20       dimension? Intervention. I'm not allowed to put up, put up to eight dog pictures. The problem is right boys back home typically to get your dog even bid should in this show. Of course. Yeah. They're going to be like, oh, you mentioned Ralph. It is a weird thing, right? You love dogs, but you also love hunting dog assessed with dogs.

Speaker 1:          02:24:43       Well, there's a bond that humans have with dogs and especially that's a thing that people don't understand that dogs and hunting have gone hand in hand forever. One of the reasons why we have such a tight bond with dogs in the first place is that dogs were used not just to keep animals away, like keep the wolves away from camps, but to help people hunt.

Speaker 4:          02:25:00       He was devastated when we were in Vietnam. They serve just some starters and afterwards we didn't know what they were and he discovered he didn't his man's best friend. So that took about a year or two tasted funny. It didn't taste right. It was, but this kind of explain it. This guy is like comes, he retired from fighting. So the first thing he does is replaced fighting with pictures of dogs. It's like we're running a business, you know what I mean? Like put some pictures of your tattoos up with something and you know, like not the fucking dog actually did I actually, I was like, Look Dylan, listen, you know, like, you know you love Moitai. I get that. But you've got to understand, people want to see it. Thai boxer that's got a little bit of like book book book out about him, you know, and you know it's him and it's that bloody [inaudible] with his tattoo and look into six pack and stuff. Right? This guy's with fucking slobbery dog runner. You know, like I'm like, okay, you're allowed one picture or a week Instagram. The rest of the winter face never set any rules. And I said, the restaurant Moy, Tai, I don't want to use these fucking around with business. Well, why don't you just do it on your personal account? They're kind of the same thing. It's all interconnected. It's Instagram and he's got his own Instagram and it's hot dogs. The dog goes, Ron loves Ralphy. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:26:20       I love dogs too. I love animals. That's something that people have a weird problem with, but they don't have a weird problem with loving animals and then feeding their animals. Animals. Like I have friends who fucking are vegans and they have cats and I'm like, do you under fucking stand that cats only eat meat? It's not like a dog. A dog can eat carrots, a dog can eat grains. Got dogs eat rice. Like if I have a friend who cooks for his dog and that happen, he gets his dog ground beef and mixes it with potatoes and rice and it's delicious. You do that for your dog. Cool. It's good. Probably herself, but you can't do that with a cat if you can do with the cat. It has to be just animal protein. That's it. That's the only thing that cat is allowed to eat.

Speaker 1:          02:27:02       Yeah. You can't feed cats grains. Cats are not supposed to eat rice that's supposed to eat carrots. Cats eat fish and they eat chicken and the beef and they liver and they eat. They eat animal protein. They're carnivores, their straight carnivores. So for you to be a Vegan and have a fucking cat living in your house, like you're involved in the killing of animals, whether you like it or not, I mean, I guess there's probably some Vegan cat food, but I can't imagine it. Let's go kill that right now. Probably kill the cat. It's probably not good. Vegan cat food bad. Let's, let's look up fat cat bat. That's one of my two flybys cats. Okay. Vegan cat food. Know. I just would imagine that shit is not good. That's basically mini lines. Oh look, it says actually, and the Vegan cat foods contained adequate amounts.

Speaker 1:          02:27:53       Is it okay to raise a cat and Vegan? I think it's hilarious, by the way. I think that is fucking hilarious. Now, artists into activists with more than one field on the family and Ithaca, New York, more in her partner, Shariah Golding. That means they're lesbians. What a surprise lesbian vegans with cats, that's crazy. You never hear about that. Relatively small, but deeply dedicated group of Vegan pet owners who believe their cats and dogs die as she reflect their own beliefs about the treatment of animals and the environmentally sustainable, sustainable lifestyles. Is it okay to give your diet of spare me all the Foa, outrage, outrage of the billions of land, animals and trillions of sea animals tortured and killed each year in the u s alone for food to feed people and pets? I don't know, man. You know, you leave a cat outside that cat's gonna kill a bird.

Speaker 1:          02:28:45       That, that's sweet kitty cat that you have as a murderer. Yeah. My cat makes these crazy noises. When he looks outside, he sees like something like a squirrel. His whole jaw starts, he start, their jaws start moving up and down. Like they can't help it. Like they just thinking about biting. I till, have you ever had a fight? Dreams? Like what? You wake up kicking, you know, you know those dreams? Well, cats have those when they see a fucking animal, if they want to kill because it's like that. They have reflux, they make noises. He's just looks out the window. Have you ever watched them like stalk a stalk, stoke your leg and then watch a lion? There's very little difference. You're like a lion crawling through the grass or a cat crow in three. A kaput. Yeah. Look, they look identical. Oh yeah, absolutely identical.

Speaker 1:          02:29:36       They're murderers, bro. They are fucking murderers apparently. Um, what they're saying is for a lot of these, a lot of these people that are there making these, uh, these diets for these dogs, there's like a big debate on whether or not it's healthy for the dogs. It's about the Vegas. He can die. It's for, for dogs and cats, whether or not it's a matter of, uh, the animal getting all the proper nutrients or just being able to stay alive. So I don't really understand people's relationships with dogs in that sense. Like I get the whole, like men having a dog, but people get weird. So like we have, we know a, um, a friend of a friend who, um, told us they have a patient who's got munch houses, you know, winch houses. Yeah. Basically. So they basically make up things so that you can get their dog operated on.

Speaker 1:          02:30:26       Like it's just like as an them, so that they have an excuse to get an operation on the adult psych. Like it's like that kid. Oh. Apparently what they're saying is that dogs and cats have a much different nutritional requirements than human beings. And that the, uh, they need much higher protein intake than a human does. So especially dogs can eat a bunch of other shit like yams and potatoes and all these different things and it's okay as long as they get sufficient amount of protein, but it's almost impossible to get the amount of protein that a dog needs with just plants and cats. It's a fucking joke. Cancer, you know, here's what, you know, put, put layouts and fucking meat and lay out a bowl of beans. See where fluffy goes. Fluffy. No, you're not a murderer. Fluffy dogs. Just choking down these pieces of meat, you know, have the yams

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       fluffy fucking ridiculous. Here's the caps. We would shut the fuck up. That thing's a murderer, man. You're going to keep it. Keep it from being a murderer. It's, it's nature. I mean, you know, it's what it does. That's what a cat does. It's kind of comedy, like everybody who's been pushing all the, like the Tofu and all the soy stuff over the last couple of years, it's starting to get breast cancer in men. It's just, you're discovering it's bad for you. I say that stuff instead of milk and I'd always feel sick, but I was like, it's gotta be healthy for you. Everyone keeps telling me that. [inaudible] Bibbs that's why I have boobs. Yeah. Even vegan cats.com is telling people to feed their cats meet. That's when shit gets real. When Vegan cats.com tells people to feed their cats, meet after much soul searching. We've decided that we need to keep our cats alone.

Speaker 2:          02:32:15       We only feed them asshole cows. Cows, it stomp on rats or something. She walks into a room. I'm gone. Cat White cat cats and hookers. Hookers. You hate strippers, man in Thailand. He just said one touches him. He just freaks out. Is that because of your experiences in in Thailand or is it just like a, it's like a thing in your DNA perhaps from past lives maybe. Will you ever stop to death by a hooker or a stripper dude back. She's talking about that you haven't gone to Thailand. I don't know if you ever go to Thailand, man. The most vicious things you've seen. You sit in the hospitals, the chicks with the guys they bottle. Like if you're going to fall with a guy that chicks the hook chicks all Yay, smash a bottle. Like they're like known for it. And especially like Petaja.

Speaker 2:          02:33:04       Yeah, like that area. The chicks, the first thing of a guy gets an arguing with another guy, they'll stand up for them and bottle the dude over her shoulder bottling. I don't know what it is so effective. Especially if you're a woman, you don't have a lot of physical strength. You hit a guy with a bottle and open them up like a fucking tomato. Yeah. Bottles are scary. Shit. When I lived in Boston, I saw an argument over, I don't know what the argument was because I was a fair bit of way. Like you know, several others by these guys were arguing and the guy's first move was to hit this guy in the face with a Heineken bottle. It was horrible. It just caught him wide open. He's bleeding all over the place and they tackled the guy who did it and the bouncers beat the shit out of him.

Speaker 2:          02:33:45       But I remember thinking like, man, you gotta be real fucking careful who you're fighting with, who you're arguing with. Addison it, this guy just smashed this guy and it just caught them open. It's bleeding everywhere, Matt. Good. Yeah, but you know what the thing I was going to say is I'd always shocks me when you see dudes in another country like Vietnam, Thailand, Brazil, starting fights with the locals. Don't fucking thinking people were stupid as fuck man. I think it's probably just DNA, like wanting to get eradicated. Like you have some shitty jeans and your

Speaker 5:          02:34:18       Eugene's want you just to be taken out of the mix. You know it's like a suicide pill. Fuck Thailand. They're like, Oh really? Okay. You have no idea and you're drunk every night. So I'm sure they start a fight with a taxi driver and the whole of Thailand jumps in. Do you live in Thailand now or do you go back and forth? Back and forth? Since I was 18 I'm 31 so wow. Long time. And you tried to live there? I tried to live there, but you know, it's actually, I mean like I love Thai people. I love the country. I love everything about it. It's very ancient. It's free, there's no rush. It's beautiful. The Thai people are amazing. Most of my friends there are tight. But um, you know, after awhile you just get, I'll just go a little bit bored. I had my brother back in Sydney as well.

Speaker 5:          02:35:04       He was running the gym. Um, you know, he got up, he got to stage where he was doing the rescue and I think he got really attached to not just, and that meant, you know, the thing of saying like, we were talking about this before me and him like, you know, like when you finished profile and what do you do? And I think like it was kind of like, you're not, you know, you're doing all this fighting and you being admired and your brain and everybody's doin and afterwards you stop and you're just like, well now, so he's going over to Thailand and you know, he's rescuing people and it's suddenly a feeling important again. Right. But he got really attached and I'm actually at one stage I wanted to go live there and um, we had a, we had a few arguments about it and eventually I just said, I think you should go because I didn't want it that Jim had made a be holding him back and he went there and two months later he's like, I'm ready to come home.

Speaker 5:          02:35:52       Did you ever think about competing in Jujitsu to maybe just explain spark your competitive desires and avoid like head trauma? I competed it a fair bit in Jujitsu and I loved it, you know? Um, but you know, I dunno like when I hit, when I was there for those two, three months last year, luckily I'm set. I got really addicted to the abbots. It was an adrenaline rush. Like why cops say that? Well, you know, you hear the radio go off. I listened to the coat. I'm thinking, okay, it's a car accident. There could be, we could be cutting people out of cars. We could be saving people, you know, one accident I'll wait to like, I was trying to actually put back three bodies back together over like, I don't know, quarter mile and a hundred meters. It's less than a quarter mile. How'd you meet her? Is trying to put everyone back together and it was a crazy adrenaline rush.

Speaker 5:          02:36:39       Put them back together, meaning saved a lot of figure out whose arm and leg was who's, oh Geez. Two blacks collided dead people. Lots and lots of bodies. There's an adrenaline rush and trying to figure out dope puzzles. They're dretler rush. Wasn't that, I think I became like a little bit desensitized to everything. Like nothing bothered me. I've seen everything, but it was more when the alarm went off in my little rescue about to set us a room half this size of this and you hear the code and all you hear is it's a car. There's an accident, but you don't know how many people, you don't know anything. So you get there and it could be like five cars. One time we got there, I was driving and they hated me driving. Like I was telling my brother in the car, why is it was like a v eight turbocharged ambulances thing and they said I'm a bad driver.

Speaker 5:          02:37:26       I drove a Lamborghini yesterday up at Vegas that was sick. Or you went to one of those places where you go, Oh yeah man, I trust me by seeing I'd be driving. And then after awhile they started racing me to the, to the driver's seat cause I just laid next to the ambulance and he used to race me there and I was like, man, why did they, you know, I said, why do you guys like me driving into more? Said Dylan when you drive man, where every religion and it sat with me and I'm thinking what the hell are they talking about? And they go, man, we're Christian. We prayed to Allah, we pray to Jesus Jewish goodnight. You are such a mat. You such a crazy driver that pretty much pretty every God just in case

Speaker 2:          02:38:09       the fuck you did. You went from motorcycle racing. Too many concussions. I'll try kickboxing. You go to fucking Thai boxing, you become a world champion in Thai boxing. Hmm. Not Enough Thrill. I need a ride fucking bowls. Oh it along the line. I can go rescue people. Let's do it. Hey, what an adrenaline rush I putting together bodies. Absolutely. Yeah. One thing I thought was interesting about it though is you know he became quite detached for a while eating candy the whole time you hear it too. What are you doing? You've got a candy thing? Nah, just sees it soothing my throat. Your throat. Okay. Yeah. Both of us got plenty of Vegas. He kind of escaped the smoke. That strategy cuts smoke indoors most of the time you can't smoke indoors in America. Most places Texas a few places I think in Texas allow it, but it, Vegas is one of the few places left where you can smoke indoors, but they have so many, I don't usually have a problem with it because they have so many like filters and man, we got air cleaning systems. Where'd you guys go? Uh, you know Joe in Australia now. I think you better look it up, but just in case. Yeah, this is bro. Knowledge is knowledge goes deep on this show. We've been promoting bro Science for four years,

Speaker 5:          02:39:17       but I'm pretty sure that they all that passed in the law that anyone born after the year 2000 can never buy cigarettes. It's illegal. So it's out first generation of non smokers.

Speaker 2:          02:39:29       I, I liked that and I don't like that at the same time cause I don't like anybody telling me what I can again of course. But I like it because kids are so god damn easily tricked or we sparked by and those chemicals that they put in cigarettes that make them more addictive. Did you ever see that movie inside job? Russell Crowe. He's your boy, right? Russell Crowe has from the air is, um, it's a great fucking movie man. And it d it's a, it's a true story based on a real chemist who the whistleblower, right? Developing. Yeah. Specific compounds designed to keep people addicted and he details, uh, the, the mechanism involved in these, uh, addiction processes. And it's like, wow, how the fuck did the government let this shit get in there? I have a lot of trouble quitting smoking. I was smoking while I was fighting and I got to the point where I was like, I get sick a lot because you're smoking and fighting.

Speaker 2:          02:40:17       I was only 20. You were smoking and finding say well that isn't sacral Raba famous for that. Um, yeah. I mean the thing about smoking it, man, I wish I never started, but I started when I was about 13 and I thought it was cool. It was an idiot. And, but, but tell him was 21. It was still smoking. I couldn't quit. I'm not dipping. Um, or you got damp know he knows I hate it meant I couldn't quit it. And you know, I got to the stage where I was like, after either quit martial arts to quit smoking and I couldn't quit smoking because I was getting sick a lot from my lungs and my sinuses. So I'd go train and then don't have a cigarette. Wow. And it was so addictive and it was really a scary thing. That's crazy. What time, what kind did you smoke?

Speaker 2:          02:40:56       Normal cigarettes, you know, I've never tried those American spirits. They have a cigarettes that are all natural. They don't have any additives. We smoke. Look at me, we started as teenagers, as stupid idiots and you know, everyone just, that's what you did socially when you'd meet up in smoke. But I was actually one of the last ones smoking and I felt really down on myself really like week about the fact I couldn't quit. I quit when I was 22 which was like 11 years ago. But I haven't. But you know, like I actually got to a stage where I was that addicted to it that I couldn't, I almost quit like training cause I couldn't, my health couldn't put up with physical exercise and I'm not surprised, man. That's tough. Will fuck you up. I absolutely agree. It's a massive prize. I everyone that I know that they'd had a cigarette addiction and then quit still longs for those.

Speaker 2:          02:41:42       God Damn, I don't, once I quit I quit. You know? Yeah. My friend Jeff. So this day he means he's quit for more than a decade. He's like, to this day, every now and then I'll see someone smoking and just look so good. I just want one punch them in the face. When I was in the casino and there's guys, there's kids right next to a guy blowing smoke and I mean I'm thinking like, okay, well you just hit him with a car, you know, like yeah, I, you know, I have a real problem with that. People just don't give a fuck about that. That's a weird thing about the cigarettes too, is that it affects the people around you and they don't give us farther. Absolutely. It's also the thing that they throw them on the ground. Yeah. Cigarette people are so likely to litter. It's the weirdest thing.

Speaker 2:          02:42:22       Like they don't have any problem with it. It's like almost on, on average more people that smoked cigarettes litter with those cigarettes and anything. I had a guy over my fucking house that was working on my house and he's sitting out in my backyard and he smokes and then he throws a cigarette on the gun and I go, what the fuck are you doing? I mean you really littering in my fucking backyard while you work. Dickhead. Tradies just a Douche bag man suggest, but I couldn't believe it. He did it right in front of me. I'm like, what the fuck are you doing man? I live here. You're just going to throw shit on the ground. Step on it. Oh, you stepped on it. It's good. Now. It has gone. Someone tried to tell me, oh, they're biodegradable. Yeah. In a fucking hundred years. In a hundred years, it'll go back into the earth. You fucking nitwit or the daughters at the beach. She's like, Hey Daddy, look at this. Look what I found is either a condom or a cigarette or degradable. You fucking

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       Dildo just ruins a good base. Biodegradable. What does it mean? What are you talking about? It's a foam fucking plastic filter at the end of a shitty piece of paper. Yeah. Eventually the earth will absorb it so you know what else is biodegradable your fucking car. Leave your car for a thousand years and won't exist.

Speaker 4:          02:43:30       Did you ever, have you ever picked up? I hate when people put them in bottles and picked up a big, all your thought was yours and you're just like, oh, that's the nastiest shit of all fear. It's cigarette ashes.

Speaker 1:          02:43:44       How about they throw them out the window too? That's a half the fires in California from shitheads trailers throwing fucking cigarettes out there and he'd do it all the time. Driving on the highway. Every day you will see some shit head throw cigarette out the window. They're not flicking it at you. They don't think they're doing anything wrong. I feel like it's, they're doing something so bad to their own body that they don't give a fuck. They don't give a fuck about poison their own bodies. They don't give a fuck about poisoning the earth itself. The worst thing is seeing the people smoking. We're going to wrap this thing up anyway. The attention span, it's not really, it's where at six o'clock already. It's been a lot of fun, dude. Three hour podcasts.

Speaker 4:          02:44:18       [inaudible] you got to sick. Reznikov is today, but

Speaker 1:          02:44:21       no worries. It was great. It was fun. No, it was fun. It was really, I'm glad we did this. Yeah. Cool. So, uh, your gym give people the, uh, the w how did they get ahold of you? What's the website?

Speaker 4:          02:44:30       Yeah, it's okay. So a, Jim's a ww w. Dot. Vitti www 2014. True. What about http? I don't think you need in that anymore. I always got the slashes backwards. But um, what's name, okay, no word. Vt One academy. [inaudible] DOT com. That's [inaudible] dot com. There you go. There's the website on the left. Just one quick thing. Do you know that a lot of French girls in Canada called Lawrence? That's really weird. Last name or first, cause I was on Tinder there that we found their first name or the last name you cycled back that big Chinese guy on the left there. When I say Lawrence, I think of a big giant ego with a guillotine that kills you. Right Lawrence. But on, on Tinder, all the girls were Lawrence. That's so weird. Really Weird. Tinder in the house and a random note getting [inaudible] gone. So that's us down there, come visit us.

Speaker 4:          02:45:19       We really friendly everything. And the other side is peak peak-at-u.com. Huh? Oh, other side is peak peak, PW k Pwee k dash@eighty-u.com. So why are you, what does that, that's a, that's the project, the growing down site that we're working on. We're going to put all like the stuff at the talent stuff on and we've got the psychologist, she's doing the podcast on and stuff. So that's um, um, that's sal kind of sat. We're just going to host everything cause that's our business side obviously. Okay. So just means to find out what is it again? It's so it's pick p p e k Dash Dash Dash um, you at 80 dash. Why are you.com? That's um, that's uh, that's not up there yet. I'm just pointing at Joe. I'm, this

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       is awkward. Okay. Alright. There we go. That's the going down site and that's going to have all the toilets. So let's just going to have a lot of projects growing down, growing downs, a project we launched because we were sick of, I'm basically throwing up sick or growing up or being at the dinner table and everyone comes up tutors. So, uh, what you're doing with yourself lately, are you working hard? That's our South African accent, right know. So my friends are psychologists and he just started getting pissed off and so he coined this whole growing down thing, which is about stop listening to other people and start fucking listen to yourself basically. Yeah, that's a great idea. Cause by the way, not only what other people give you shitty advice, they will give you shitty advice because they got shitty advice and they want you to continue the tradition of suffering.

Speaker 2:          02:46:55       People love watching people fail and struggle because they've failed and struggled. It's very rare that someone would tell you, listen to me, I failed. My life is a fucking disaster. Don't do what I did. They don't do it. Why don't you fucking grow up? I've never heard anyone say that. I've had many people tell me to grow up. I've had many people that were fucking miserable telling me that I needed to grow up. I'm like, I don't get it. I'm happy you're not and I need to grow up. This is baffling. Do you know you're gonna die? I'm gonna die isn't the whole point. Do enjoy this as much as possible. I feel like I'm enjoying it and I feel like you're not. So I'm super confused as to why you're giving me advice. One quick thing, just before we wrap up, I just wanted to share because I, it just was something interesting that came up were when we were backstage at the UFC, right?

Speaker 2:          02:47:37       And this is about growing down and we're back there. I'll fighters prepared pretty well for the flight, right? Um, and you go there and everybody's telling you what to do. Don't eat bread, don't eat this. Switch a potato or sweet potato and everyone means well, right, cut weight this way. Cut Weight that way. Prepare this way. Guys were holding pads hard as they could the night before the fire. Now we take it, we taper a week before and we're there and I'll fly to starts getting nervous. You know when he starts copying a little bit, because these are professionals, right? Like we're professionals too, but we study, you know, we know what we're doing, but he starts switching to sweet potato. It cuts out bread. He starts training a little bit closer to the fight then he should be. And the thing was was like everybody was telling everybody what to do and he ended up dropping five pounds by mistake because he changed everything that week.

Speaker 2:          02:48:22       And I was like, I was thinking about for comedy for fighting and all that stuff is like, it's really fucking hard to just trust that look, I've in potatoes and red meat my whole life. Let's just keep doing it until the fight, you know? And so that's what the whole growing down it was. It seems like if those guys are given that advice and how to lose weight, that seems like good advice. Well he seems like the [inaudible] wait till the last, it's probably because he probably should be lighter in the first place. I looked at it as a healthier diet. The advice is right, but the timing is wrong. Like you're about to go up on stage and some guy comes up, he goes, man, before I go on stage, I usually go do a quick shot. I like to kill her up my nose. That works for me. And then you go and do what you got to station everything sniffling, you're bleeding. So it was just, you know, for all the Aussies coming up is just have a confidence

Speaker 1:          02:49:08       in what you're doing is good. Write notes and do it after the fight. And that was just something we learned backstage. You know? It's definitely good point about tapering off, man. That's one thing that people make a huge mistake about [inaudible] they train too hard. They think it's good to train hard the day before the fight, but training breaks the body down. The whole purpose of training is to break the body down. If you don't understand that, then you need to talk to someone who's an exercise physiologist and understand what is the purpose of working out, working out taxes, the body. So the body heals. Healing is what makes you stronger. The breaking down of the body forces your body to react to the fact that you're making it do all this work. So he goes, okay, we're lifting weights. Now we got to get stronger because this mother fucker wants us carrying heavy things all the time.

Speaker 1:          02:49:50       Okay, this guy wants us running up hills. Boy, we better increase our vo two Max because we want to stay alive. Obviously the body has different requirements now we need more oxygen. But to break it down the week of is really not beneficial. You some guys do it though and they get away with it. So I'll guide it, looks at them and he goes, fuck this is a pro. I better do it. It is. Well, there's a lot of schools of thought. I mean it's just like hard training. You know, there's a lot of schools of thought when it comes to hard sparring and then there's, you know, even pros like I was like Martin Kampmann they say you should spar once a week at most. Yeah, he's very good, very smart and very technical but you know a lot of guys didn't do it that way and they have suffered because of it.

Speaker 1:          02:50:28       There's a lot of damage that gets done that's unnecessary. Whether it's in training, whether it's a, you know, in preparation, strength and conditioning, whatever it is. There's a lot of unnecessary damage. And what we were talking about before about MMA training, I think it's still in a learning period. I think we still haven't got it down the way. Like say football has it down, they know exactly how to train to develop like top flight football players, basketball, same thing. You go to a basketball camp, you're dealing with top flight strength and conditioning coach. They really know how to deal with, I mean you're dealing with multi, multimillion dollar athletes and they have that investment and they want to keep it healthy and really no one should apply that more than MMA fighters because who the fuck gets hurt more than MMA fighter

Speaker 5:          02:51:09       Whiteside? And Woodside probably is the list taught sport in the world, especially in Thailand because there is no history of teaching. So it was like, what is teaching fighters? They just copied wise and loose pretty much. So I was like, that's one of the most backward sports in the world of them. I never may. And there isn't a lot of smoking and drinking as well. I mean we had better now better. They've gotten a lot of um, you know, fight against alcohol, fight against drugs. This is a lot of promotion. Now you've got a lot of guys like yachts and Clive Fairtex and mallow pedal. He's actually American, um, you know, and balk out. And these guys are heroes. So for people there's a lot more pushed towards the be healthy, get fit. You can make good money now you can go to Japan, you can fight in a very car dude dives.

Speaker 1:          02:51:56       Yeah. I have friends that that trained in font and Thailand and they were telling me about everybody's smoking cigarettes. And I have my friend Chris started smoking when he was in Thailand because he's fighting, he's fighting in Thailand. Everybody was training

Speaker 4:          02:52:06       and smoking and he started smoking too, just like to be one of the gang. Now he smoke cigarettes, you know, share Champa cat, some grit, you know, I've heard the name, he's the only like Tom Post sort of base where we were. Oh really? We broke a record. Rufus, his leg. You've seen the fight, I'm sure in other wineries. He puts him and he breaks his leg the fall. I didn't see that food drive. It's on youtube. It's worth watching. But we saw him and he's, I mean, he's a legend for Andy Hug before all these guys. Right. And we go to Thailand and Petaja and he's just sitting there smoking. So if I buy them a box of cigarettes, he'll let me film him kicking the bag, keeping a box of cigarettes, and he kicked the bag for me. Show me the technique. Like they're just smoking and alcohol over there's adequate control. Wow.

Speaker 1:          02:52:46       Last question before we go. Um, I'm a big fan of a, of kickboxing, obviously kickboxing's starting to make its way into the United States, uh, in a big way with Gloria Loris then yes, on spike. My only problem with it is I don't like tournaments. I don't like the idea of making someone fight twice in the night. And I definitely don't like them doing it with like high level kickboxing. Like Nathan Corbett, um, fought, uh, gold con sockets, right? Go Con Saki knocked him out in the first round. Broke is a eardrum that stopped the fight and then he had to, he had to go into the final round. Go on. Saki did against Tyrone Spong. We're Tyrone Spong fought three hard rounds, this young Brazilian kid and then fought in the round and brokers, it's anger. I don't think this Shin break came from the fact that he had a fight three rounds and coke on how to fight one, but the idea that one guy could fight one round and then the other guy could go three rounds to go to war and then they meet in the finals.

Speaker 1:          02:53:41       I think that's fucking crazy and I think in this day and age in 2014 with what we know about concussed fighters, exact head injuries and then taking a break and cooling down in between that fight in having an hour in between the first fight in the second, I think it's fucking crazy. But also the removal of Klich makes it fucking desk elbows, no elbows, no clinch won that fight I think with Elvis. Well he's a real moitai specialist. I mean he is an elbow guy and they took away one of his best weapons. That's really the clinch and the elbows to two of his best weapon.

Speaker 4:          02:54:16       The thing about Gloria though

Speaker 1:          02:54:18       for us is that it's getting a house on a big scale, which is good. Like in that way. It's good. I understand the tournament, like your, your perspective, the tournament's kind of agreeing away, but to get striking with competing against the UFC so hard. Yeah, it's hard. Well, I think that first of all, there aren't spike, which is a huge company, isn't know spike is Viacom. They're owned by huge, huge, huge billion dollar, you know, backing behind them. There's a shit load of money in, in involved in spike and Viacom. But I think that the tournament format is dangerous. Yeah, I really do. I think it's antiquated. It's dangerous. I loved it. That's why it's amazing to watch pride. But I, for the athletes when you're dealing with world class athletes like a Tyrone Spong, Lego con Saki, I just think it's unfair and I think it's fucking, it's the wrong way. I almost feel like it's disrespectful to the sport itself and the fight is to force worldclass fighters to fight more than once in the night I think is outrageous

Speaker 4:          02:55:19       because the thing that was going to say just quickly about that is, um, one of the biggest problems I think with Gloria is it's also going to reduce the, the um, like might sign America is basically kickboxing with knees and elbows, right? The clinch in Thailand is like 30, 40% of Thai boxing, not in America, not in Holland. Right. So you're single, these guys coming into MMA and not, it is, it can increase head damage because there's no clinching, but also the skillsets that come from the clinch, they don't exist in him and a yeah. You know? Yeah. Like

Speaker 1:          02:55:51       we see it a little bit with Anderson Silva. You see what a few more Thai guys, they know how to clench. And this sounds really stupid

Speaker 4:          02:55:57       cause you got a bad neck. But I was saying like, if you get to clinch with like a tired, like I don't, I'm trying to say it modestly, like real clinch, like Thai clinch. It's, it's almost like doing flowing Greco

Speaker 1:          02:56:10       body locks back. Takes snap downs. What do you like lion fine. Do you ever watch lion fight? What's that line fighter? An organization in Vegas and they're putting it mal pet fights for them. They have a lot of really high level people that are coming over from Europe and fighting for them. They got really good fights they're putting on right. That was Cyborg Christina sidewalk. She lost to this a girl from a hot on her, she said to fucking Muay Thai fights. They're, they're hard on her because she took me out hormones. That's the bottom line. She's such a nice lady. The reality, I'm sure she's a nice lady, but the reality is she took me out hormones. But you're saying they include clinch clinches and elbows. Great. Yeah, I mean they have it. It's a Kevin Ross fights through them. They have, yes. And you know, elbows clinch, everything take downs. They, they, they trip each other. They drop each other. Yes. It is beautiful. And it's the comprehensive full style of [inaudible] and it's safer. It's better. And it's also more lethal. It's more effective. Elbows, kicks, knees, everything.

Speaker 4:          02:57:07       What's um, what's, what's the premium card without guy who fought not to even look, he's got a long way to go. He's only, you know, his first fight, right? But he used more time where tie in the clinch and like people were saying what, what did he do there? And I was like, that's like first day stuff in Thailand. So I think Americans are robbing themselves a bit by doing glory, Not Moy, Thai, Thai. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          02:57:29       I couldn't agree more. I couldn't agree more. And I think we're on the same page as far as the respect for the athletes, making them fight more than once a night against worldclass guys on an uneven playing field. Like you could have fought, like you could fight a worldclass guy and get rocked a bunch of times in three rounds and be really fucked up in that dressing room when you're preparing for the title and the other guy lands a head kick 15 seconds into the fight and you're both fighting in the finals against each other. I think that's crazy. I've absolutely and they're going to have a big tournament in La and I'm going to be there. We're going to watch it every time. I watch it every time too. I'm a big supporter of it. I just think they should reconsider. I just think, and I wish they would go moy Thai style, just fucking bring in the elbows clench.

Speaker 1:          02:58:07       They'll watch some of those line fights. They're doing it and it's very, it's great. They have him on access TV. Yeah. Right. Gentlemen, thank good. A pleasure.
