Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Jamie bam, motherfucker, and we're live with filthy skills by the way, if people wondering what filthy skills is, this is a hilarious story because I just saw you wearing. I ran into you in salt lake. I didn't know I was. I was going to be there by the way. Cameron Hanes, my friend, but winter. Oh my camera here. Wildlife conservationist to ultra marathon runner. Ultimate Badass. I was. I'm in Salt Lake skiing with my family at the same time. Was it called the great western is a Western hunting exposition. Conservation Exposition, something like that. Which I really want to just drag some of the, the biggest, diehard vegans were the most. The angry ones just let them loose there and go wander around. They'd go there, they'd go bonkers. They'd run into walls and probably, you know, pee themselves. It's, it's all just skulls and shit and mounts and the cool stuff and places you can go to shoot your own food.

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       But uh, you were wearing this filthy skill. Shirts. I'm like, what? What is filthy skills? And I've been seeing it on your instagram. What is filthy skills? This is hilarious. So some guy sent you this and we'll put it up on the screen so you can see it on the youtube. Some guy sent this, which is a a fuck. This is a photo. The youtube comment with this guy have Yada Jamie. Whereas some guy said to you, here it is. Fuck you for destroying our world with your filthy hunting skill. You're filthy hunting skill. Why don't you kill yourself instead to reduce the population dumb ass. First of all, the spelling on this is atrocious. I. It's almost like he got his dog to write that forum. Yeah. F K space letter. You space for district got destroying, right? Yeah. World, that's a tough word. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       He's like, he's. He's weird. He's like populations, good faculties, good. But your. He does. You are people that do. You are. What do you do with all that extra time that you spend, say between like why? Oh you, what do you do with, you know, you don't have to spend that time now working those fingers. Very efficient. Now you're filthy hunting skills. So you saw that and were like, hey, there's a couple of things I thought I did not know I had the power to destroy the world. I am more powerful than I than I ever knew. That's impressive, isn't it? I said, hey, I have filthy honeys. I thought that was sort of like a compliment, you know? So it's hence the shirt. There's a, there's such a disconnect going on this world right now. We were talking about this today while we're practicing.

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       It seems like there's some sort of a culture war. There's a movement of people right now, there's this whole eat what you kill movement and a lot of people are rejecting the idea of factory farming and rejecting the idea of a buying process. Food and buying cows that are locked up in pens and treated like a commodity rather than like a living animal. Right. And going out into the woods and hunting and getting their own food and connecting to this sort of primal existence and self sufficient self sufficient. So what I like about it, I don't, I don't rely on anybody to feed my family and a lot of people love that, but then there's this group of people that are completely disconnected from the way the wild works that are very angry about all this. And so there's some bizarre conversations I've been having with some very well meaning very intelligent people.

Speaker 1:          00:03:33       They're very nice people. And this is, this is the, this is where there's a big misconception here like I got, I got into it with a gang of people recently and I wish you even say I got into it because I've kind of given up on insulting people online because I don't get anything out of it. Right? I get it. If you don't like it, you don't like me. I get it. I liked me, I liked me. I'm a nice guy. I mean if you meet, if you meet me and you communicate with me, Nice. Even if we disagree, I guarantee we're going to have a pleasant conversation. I'm a nice person, right? So when someone insults me or says nasty shit or it makes a nasty video about me, I don't watch it. I'm not going to. When people want you to respond, I'm not going to.

Speaker 1:          00:04:15       Why would I? I don't have enough time. I don't know enough time to spend with the people I love. I don't have time to hang out with you. What am I going to have 15 extra minutes to watch a video and then make my own video and I don't have time for this world. This life is short. Okay? So I get that people are upset, but the core, the core message that everybody's getting out, there's one of two messages. One message is you should never eat animals at all and then we should live this idyllic existence where everyone lives off nuts and twigs and shit and vegetables and that's all you eat. Pine cones. You can. That's fine. You can do that. But then there's the other that use port and I support that. The best way to live in this modern world is to go out and get your own meat problem with that.

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       Of course, this is a real problem. Everybody can't do that. There's not enough wildlife, there's not enough time and, and I don't think that we, we think everybody should do that. No, that our point is, and I think people like us is you don't have to do it, but don't condemn it. Yeah, don't condemn it because we, I mean as you said in my intro, conservationist hunters are conservation is we're the one that's paying the money for habitat for all these biologists to tell us exactly how many animals are out there. They got boots on the ground and they're out there with the animals doing the number of surveys. I'm figuring out harvest harvest numbers to try to achieve carrying capacity. The guys online who think that grizzly bears are almost extinct and like, how could you kill a bear? You know, they want to kill me because I killed a bear in Alaska that they probably have no clue how many bear running around Alaska, but somehow

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       they know that I shouldn't have killed it. They don't know how many are there. They don't know what the bear with the bear population, where I killed two brown bear, which are grizzly bear and a black bear. They don't know that those bears need to be controlled. Otherwise they decimate the Moose population. It's, it's all about Moose, everything. And part of that balance is humans. So people always say, well, animals will take care of themselves. You know, they've always, they've always, you know, it's worked out, predators kill Blah Blah, blah. We're just interfering. Well, yeah, we're interfering also because of your house, you know, we're taking habitat so we can't let the animals sorted out because we're the ones encroaching on habitat. So we are in that process. We are at the top of the food chain. We require habitat to. They require habitat. So there's a balance. It's all part of the equation. It

Speaker 3:          00:06:47       is. And this balance is, there's some parts of it that are set in place before you and I were born and before a lot of these people that are arguing everybody before everybody was arguing about this has been born. The cities were already in place long time ago. Um, the food chain has already been in place, the market chain has been in place as far as like getting food to supermarkets. Most of the supermarkets that are in existence were there long before you and I started shopping at them and that's, that's a part of this equation of human beings. The, another part of the equation of human beings is what you're talking about with predators. And this is one of the things that I had a discussion about what the guys who I really like and there's some misconception I didn't like these guys, the guys that made that movie cowspiracy Oh right.

Speaker 3:          00:07:29       They're very good guys. They're very smart guys. They're, they're, they're vegans. They became vegans while factory farming. Well, it's a lot about factory farming and a lot of it is about the amount of waste methane, uh, that gets into the atmosphere because of factory farming. Um, the, the actual waste as far as their, their shit, the cows shit. And what would the amount of devastation that does to our environment and how much actual land these animals need to graze in order to feed them. These are really complicated numbers and disputed. They went with the extreme on one end and there's some other people I'm having tomorrow. Doug, during my friend from Minnesota, Minnesota, Wisconsin. My, my buddy from, um, he's uh, from the Steve Show mediator. He has that a large a ranch out in, um, uh, what the name of this you hunted out there and I'm trying to figure the name of the town is.

Speaker 3:          00:08:28       He's a very weird small town. Anyway, he's in Wisconsin and this really cool area where it's the, um, you know, they have a, it's called the driftless area where the glaciers missed, so it's all hilly and gorgeous and beautiful and that's where he lives. He pays his cows out there and he's going to come in and give his perspective on a lot of this stuff is right. Um, but they, they had this really strange idea about wolves and the strength that I had to correct them. And this idea about, you know, that we've hunted the wolves to near extinction and now the reintroduction p and won't haunt them again. And you really have to stop that. I'm like, man, you gotta this is wolves are fucking cool and this is one of the things that I said these guys, nobody wants to eliminate wolves, but throughout human history, long before we were around, people have had a problem with wolves and there's a reason for that.

Speaker 3:          00:09:20       All the big bad wolf stories, all the Little Red Riding Hood, all that Shit. It's because wolves are fucking terrifying. They are very, very dangerous and I brought up the whole world war one incident with the Germans and the Russians had a fucking cease fire because so many of them were getting killed by wolves. They made an agreement. They're like, look, obviously we got a real problem that's bigger than us, like 10 people. Let's stop killing each other for a little while and Kelly's fucking wolves, and they killed the wolves and then went back to killing each other. It's a crazy story. That is. And then there's the other story from the 14 hundreds in Paris were wolves killed more than 40 people in Paris. The city of Paris was overrun with bulbs. That's insane. Wolves are killing machines and you have to keep their populations down and if you don't, you run into huge problems.

Speaker 3:          00:10:07       People bring up. There's this video that people bring up all the time. How wolves changed rivers. Um, and it's a fascinating video. We played it on here before. The problem with that video is the guy who made that video is fucking nuts. Okay. And he is a romantic to the extreme and the idea of introducing keystone predators into these areas where they haven't been before. His idea was that wolves are making things better for all these other animals by getting rid of the, but they're not. They're decimating the elk population. And there was a thing written by scientists disputing all of his claims that were in that video. So then I want to like, what's this guy's deal about? So I listened to this NPR podcast on him. This mother fucker wants to bring lions back to Europe. He was, he's like, there's parts of the UK that are empty and we could reintroduce lions and hyenas, but pitcher, Yada, Yada, Yada.

Speaker 3:          00:11:02       A good idea. I'm to bring you case not that big. You're going to bring violence like actual African lions and his ideas that they found these, these fossils of these lions that existed there thousands of years ago, so then it'd be back. He wants to reintroduce them. Well, people have, by the way, this guy was suicidal and depressed, like to the extreme ready to kill himself and then decided to what he calls rewilding. He reintroduced himself to the wild, started experiencing while and fell in love with wildlife and nature and that's what pulled him up out of this. And now it's his mission. Hey, I'm in love with wildlife and nature to mystically, but realistically. Yeah. Well it's. I do want to say one thing because we've talked about factory farming and you know, the downside of it. We're not lumping ranchers, regular ranchers that

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       raise cattle. I mean, my family is a cattle ranching family in eastern Oregon, so I'm not talking about, you know, cows that are out with enough pasture out there and then, and then being killed, taken mark and kill. We're talking about that. Animals that don't leave the cage, that are standing in their own feces and just never move and never have a life and then have a bullet shot through their head in their debt. You know, we're talking the, that extreme. That's not everybody. I have a lot of respect for farmers and ranchers and uh, I mean, so we don't want to lump everybody into the ranches. Are All factory farmers?

Speaker 3:          00:12:27       No, they're certainly not. And one of the things that I noticed when I was in Montana when I first went hunting with Rinella, we went through the Missouri breaks and there was all these cows wandering around and I was like, what is the deal with this? Well, those cows literally wander free on public land they have. And this is what this Oregon nutty shit is about. And within Nevada nutty shit was about with all these crazy ranchers that want to fucking take over the government. Lincoln. Yeah, that's not good. But the, what do they call it? [inaudible]. That's my favorite by far. We don't even know. We never found out who came up with that description. Someone was claiming that someone on the podcast came up with that description, but when we were in Montana, we. That's when I first got introduced to this. They, they.

Speaker 3:          00:13:11       These animals are literally roam free and wild. They sleep outside, they eat outside, they wander through and then they're corralled and when they're brought to slaughter then their corralled and so for the majority of their life they live off the land. Almost like an elk. Yeah, like a wild animal essentially. Yeah. Big Step there. Someone's someone's property. Some people have a hard time with that. They have a hard time with the idea of property, of an animal being property and I get that too, man. Another thing I've watched recently was this penn and teller from that. You ever see that show bullshit? No, it's a great show. 'Em that they used to do on showtime, but one of them they did was on pita and the Animal Liberation Organization or whatever the fuck are heard of that foundation for free except Holy Shit, violent arsonists burning down buildings was spray painting, Vegan power and these.

Speaker 3:          00:14:04       I mean just like the nutty as shit, but they don't think that people should have pets. They don't think, and here's one of the best parts about it. One of the women that was in this program who works for Peta was also a diabetic. This is where you got a buckle yourself in because there's only one way you get that diabetes medicine. It's from animals, so it's an animal product, and so she was saying that she didn't think that she was a hypocrite because that product saves her life so she could save more animals. Well, guess what? Fuck face. That's what hunting is. Exactly. That sort of hunting is exactly. I mean if you, if you go out, you hunt a wolf and I'm not, I'm not into hunting wolves, but if they have to control their population like that, not in a hunting, anything. I don't meet somebody. Somebody is got to kill them. Somebody's got to do it and they're doing it by the way there. And also, here's another thing about

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       California, California mountain lions are a giant issue. There's an article that I posted up recently. Pull it up, Jamie, that someone. Someone sent me yesterday, they did this like you cannot hunt mountain lions in California. There's a reason for it is not here. It's not logical. It's all based on people who are animal lovers who got into a position of power or voted this in. Well, there's the study they're finding because they killed these mountain lions when they start moving into neighborhoods and killing pets and it's super common. They've killed. What's the number of mountain lions they've killed this year because it's. It's crazy. Okay. Here with a 170 107 mountain lions were killed last year legally by the government, so that's 107 mountain lions and people didn't get tagged for, which means that's money that didn't go into the state coffers. Then it didn't go to conservation.

Speaker 1:          00:15:40       It's just money. It's. It works. The opposite state is paying. Exactly. Yeah. State is paying for going into the hole. They're going in the hole. Instead of going into the profit margin, which would they normally did in the black and red. I'm colorblind matter. So they analyze these mountain lions and they found it. Mostly what they're eating is pets. They're. They're eating fucking. Only five percent had eaten deer. Right? Well, they're going to go with the easiest target. Yeah, but that seems sane. Only five. Granted, a lot of these animals, they're there. They're killing their already problem animals. Well, in what happens with lions are so territorial, so the younger lions come up and the more dominant lions have their area, so the younger ones are forced to go somewhere else. They can't really cross. So they go somewhere else. What's left is cities and neighborhoods and residential and that's where the pets are.

Speaker 1:          00:16:34       So I mean those are probably juvenile lions mostly and down in there and it's just a matter of time before a little kid gets snatched or whatever and people don't want to talk about that or think about that. But that's the reality of it. They're just predators. They're killers. They're going for the easiest target right now. That's a dogs and cats, but they don't care. They don't care. They're not hugging each other and crying like we've seen billboards of that either. We're going to get into that in a moment, but I think this is what I'm trying to get at. Um, this is where I think there's a dispute and a misconception in the misconception is that hunters are all these evil people that want to hunt these animals to kill them so they can put them on their wall. Almost all of the money that goes to fish and game fish and wildlife management organizations that protect wetlands, that protect public lands for, for camping and for, for people to use and people to enjoy and go hike the money to support those comes from hunting. Yeah. People hate that. They hate it. But by far, by far, the amount of money that comes from conservation comes from hunting by far for the amount of money goes for conservation, for the animals, for the animals, for habitat

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       restoration. You know, that show we were just at in Utah, um, they had a mule deer tag that was auctioned off. They give for an antelope island tagged. They give two tags. One is in the drawing, so you have very small chance of getting it because there's huge bucks. Whereas antelope island, I don't know, Utah, I'm not sure exactly where it is. There isn't an actual island. I don't know. I don't know if it's just a place they call antelope island or if it's an actual island. Jamiel find out he is a state park. Yeah, it's, I knew it was a park, but I didn't know if it's an actual island or not. Um, uh, but anyway, so one is a drawing. There it is. So it's, is that the Great Salt Lake there? Yeah. So it's a, you see that as set out into the great salt lake and it's not, it's not a detached island or doesn't look like it was just a long peninsula.

Speaker 2:          00:18:36       Yeah. So it's a peninsula they call antelope island and that's, there's huge bucks and I think they're sheep. They're also. But the bucks are what draw the draw the money. So they auctioned one off and it went for $410,000 for one deer tag and that most of that money, 90 percent 10 percent goes to a to funding the auction and doing all the things that's required there. Ninety percent of that 400, $10,000 goes right to habitat restoration on the island. I'm building a water water sources, enhancing those re relocating animals off that peninsula there because the genetics, our genetics are so good to and the bucks are big and the sheep are big, so they're really relocate those superior genetics throughout Utah. So then you might not draw that tag or you might not have $410,000, but those genetics are spread throughout Utah. So they're spread in areas where general hunters have the access to. And uh, it's just, it's all positive. It's all positive for the state park. And you know, anti hunters will say, well, if you really cared about the animals, you just, you know, do the 400, $10,000 and not go hunting. Well, it is true. What is it an anti hunter do that?

Speaker 3:          00:19:49       Well, here's, here's a part of the problem. There's a, there's a bunch of problems with, with all these discussions. And a big part of it is that the people that are arguing against the hunting, they, they, they don't regularly go into the wild, into these habitats, in these environments and see how brutally hard they are for these animals to survive anyway. It's not like if you kill a buck that buck live to be five years old, you might be taking a year off it's life. That's right. No, there's, there's no. There's no 100 year old deer out there. That was the long, long great life. And this is the idea of one of the parts of hunting that actually aids in conservation is when you get a mature buck and you harvest that mature buck, you are allowing the younger deer to breed where they might not have gotten the opportunity. And you're also in a lot of cases, saving their lives because they get killed and fights with older deer, like a lot of die

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       from fights. People find them all the time. They literally stab each other to death. They don't have those antlers to look cool. No, they don't have those therapists. They slam into each other. That's what they do. Same with elk. Yeah. Same with elk. I mean when you and I were in Colorado was one of the coolest fucking things we saw is when. Remember when we went down in near that little creek area when there was, there was like a huge herd of 20 elk together and those elk were duking it out and slamming into each other. Oh, that sounds amazing. Well, here's another thing that I don't think antennas realize. You know, you go out for an extended period and the killing, the actual killing is such a small part of the hunt, you know? I mean it's those experiences. Like when we saw those bulls fighting and we saw, I think there were seven bowls and there's one nice bowl at 3:50 class bowl.

Speaker 1:          00:21:34       He was a herd bull, but their satellite bowls spread throughout on the APP. He's, he kept him pushed out and they were jostling around and we were there. We didn't kill anything, but the experience of that night was one I'll never forget. We had a bull sneak in behind us to 15 yards and a nice bowl. A bowl that would have been a great bullet for you to kill and it didn't happen, but it was just like the adrenaline of that experience. I mean, he was right there behind the bush. I mean, right there. So close screaming, but nothing died. No it. But we are predators. We were predators. They were prey and that's, that's life. That's life in the mountains, right? That's how it works. Even if we didn't have a bow, even if we weren't there to kill anything, if we just had calls, so we were just calling them in, it would have been an amazing experience because when you were there with essentially as wild and animal as you're ever going to get.

Speaker 1:          00:22:29       I mean North American elk is a 1000 pound, gigantic wild animal with a tree growing out of its head and it's living the way it's lived for thousands of years and you know, you as a person who lives in Oregon and me as a person who lives in California, we travel into their land. We we hike in to where they're at and we experience this wild existence that they live in and we don't want to stop that. We're not trying to kill them off. We want more of them. We the NS is the idea of killing a mature one. Would you want to take out an animal that does not have much time left and you help the rest of the animals survive because of that. You, you make it so that the younger bulls have a chance to thrive and breed. Otherwise they're pushing out. They're pushed out and they're not doing anything and, but, but I will say one thing.

Speaker 1:          00:23:19       So you said even if we wouldn't have had weapons, it was still had been been amazing, but to me it would have been different. Yes, it would have been different because if I'm just an observer internally, I feel a lot different. I only, I feel like I'm a Predator when I have a weapon, so I don't know if I could, if I would have worked as hard, if I would have cared as much if we were just observing, you know what I mean? Because if you remember that we snuck down, we're sneaking or I mean we're on our butts, kind of scooting down in the two bowls, were jostling around right there, kind of sparring a little bit and we had a small window through the brush and I was like, you are right, right here. As looking at Mike, I said, can you see that window?

Speaker 1:          00:24:02       Do you see that window? We can get that Arrow through. It was just that in the intensity of that moment. So you're a predator, that's your pray. How can you ethically kill it? That's alert. All the all it comes down to. I mean that's why we're there. To me, that's everything. You know, it says that crunch time moment. Well there's one of the most ridiculous things that you see when I look at your instagram or even my instagram, if I rarely post a picture of a data animal just because of that. I'll post fish all day long and nobody gives a shit. Nobody gives a fuck about fish. It's hilarious. It's hilarious. The, the hierarchy, we'll fish. They're not alive. Are they? Here they are. I believe they are. But, um, if you post a picture of an elk or God forbid a bear, people lose their fucking minds.

Speaker 1:          00:24:46       And one of the things that people love to say is if it's an original thought, it's one of those things that did not. They usually say, yeah, you're such a big moon. How about you do that without a weapon? I love that without what hunter has ever killed anything in the history of MMA. That's what hunters are. Shit, tell me a hunter. Even a caveman that ever killed without a weapon of some sort. What are they talking about? They're not talking about anything. They're just talking. They're just trying to demean you. And I go to their fucking page and one of them, uh, this guy was feeding his animals meet. And I'm like, that shit come from a meat tree. He's like, this guy was shitting all over you. And then I go to his page, he's got dogs, he's got dogs. And he's feeding them me.

Speaker 1:          00:25:30       I'm like, Oh man, there's some fucking convenient thinking going on here. It's, it's so strange how many people have these convenient patterns of thought where they're self righteous. They take the moral high ground, not look, I the only person that has any say, the only person that has a leg to stand on is a person who's a Vegan who doesn't eat any, any animal products, any animal products, okay. That's a small percentage of the population, but if they want to criticize it there and they have an argument, they have a very small leg to stand on. Holy ground. When you have a conversation with them, that's when that argument kind of falls apart. It does because, okay, v, if they're hardcore Vegan, fine, but are they growing their own vegetables? Very few because if they're not, they still are responsible for animals dying. If you've ever driven by, if you've ever been into farmland and say a field has been harvested once the field is harvested, you'll notice buzzards flying around that field.

Speaker 1:          00:26:27       You know why? Because there's a bunch of dead animals out there. There's rabbits that were killed during the harvest. There's mice, there's all so fonds. What it is a big problem with grouse, whatever. I mean those, you know, the combines or whatever they're using there is just tearing everything up and think animals are dying so you can, unless you're growing your own vegetables, unless you're doing it yourself Vegan, you're responsible for animals dying. If your house isn't made of wood because it's made of wood, there's timber harvest it. And when that timber was harvested, animals die. So I mean, well they're also their habitats displays. So people, well I think with their ideas, they want to do the least harm possible. Okay. But a lot of them already came from a background where they eat meat. Like I had this one guy was fucking arguing with me wanting to argue with me and giving me all this grief.

Speaker 1:          00:27:17       And then he admits that he was a mediator just seven months ago. It's been a Vegan for seven months. He's fucking 40. So for 39 years and three months, this motherfucker, five months, whatever it was is my math. So this guy for all these were very quick though. Your math is very quick, but my point is Sarah dead hunter. Come on, man. You can't see that seven months ago you were a fucking Vegan and you're shitting out are you were you were a mediator. You're shitting all over these people saying it's a. it's a moral high ground. They elevate themselves. There are a bunch of the red. They're above us because we're redneck hunters. Right? Same thing. I had this kid, he looked like he was maybe younger twenties, but he's, I mean he's a very passionate about his stance on what's right and what's wrong and so I went to his page, same as you.

Speaker 1:          00:28:07       I see a bunch of hot dogs on there and I was like, dude, enjoy those hot dogs, but before you judge me or condemn me, why don't you live a little, you're 20 years old, what the hell do you know about anything? And all of a sudden you know what's right and wrong, and he's like, he says, I'm going to have an answer for this or Karma or some crazy thing. I'm like, what do you know? You haven't even lived yet? Well, not only that, hot dogs are probably the worst. It is one of the worst. I mean that is ground assholes and cow digs. The probably one of the worst things you could fucking eat too filled with nitrites and nitrates and whatever's bad for you. I understand that they're trying to work it out for themselves and working it out for themselves. A lot of times people want to condemn people that are living a lifestyle that's outside of their.

Speaker 1:          00:28:54       They decide, hey, I'm going to live this small carbon footprint lifestyle where I'm going to be humane and ethical and I'm going to be cruelty free, Hashtag cruelty free and I'm going to go on it. That's like Hashtag cruelty free. It's like they want to tell you half of them have fucking Vegan and their names, which is hilarious of Vegan. This Vegan, that healthy, happy Vegan fucking Vegan flowerchild everyone's. But it's a part of their name. Like it's, it's a big part of their identity and it becomes, it becomes like a cult and I don't mean it like, you know, you have to fucking initiation and pay dues, but I mean it's like you're a part of a gang and it's. People have a tendency to do that. Good or bad. They have a tendency. Hunters have a tendency to do it. People will fucking use windows, have a tendency to do it, but I don't like apple.

Speaker 1:          00:29:39       One fucking windows and apple. You're a piece of shit. But. But hunters don't have the hate that these anti hunting vegans have. They don't, they don't. I mean, hunters don't go to their pages and who cares? Live your life. Yeah, know I get where their thought process. They think they're doing the right thing, doing the right thing and there's a lot. This is not another thing I want to point out and I went on this twitter page, a discussion the other day. I went on this rant. I don't hate vegans have vegans that are friends. It's not as. I don't know. I'm not lumping everybody in. You know this. There's a small percentage of people that are assholes that are arrogant and outspoken and really aggressive and mean and shitting, and where's the cruelty free. They're like, why are you being cruel to other people that are like, look around with tolerance.

Speaker 1:          00:30:29       Go outside and drive for 20 minutes and I guarantee you you're going to pass 30, 40 places that have dead animals in them. Every fucking supermarket you pass by every fast food place, every restaurant, every gas station that's slim. Jim's at the fucking counter or all of that is animal. So you. For you to find a hunter, the one person that you could point to that probably kills animals in the most ethical and humane way possible and contribute and pastries to be, to play part of the conservation. Rolling. Yeah. You know, and people hear these podcasts, oh, you fucking go to justify what you're doing. If you have to justify it, there's something wrong. No, it's the arguments or tiresome. There's a guy that's coming on next week, his name is, uh, how do you say his name? Tovar. How do you. So really to Varsa ruling there.

Speaker 1:          00:31:15       That's, that sounds so really, he's an author and a guy that used to be a Vegan who's not a hunter. Right. And panties will be bunched. They will get sandy and tweets will be tweeted. Good. It's gonna get crazy, but I, I just think that podcast like this and conversations like this with a guy like you, like I think what you do is the best way to do it. I mean, I've said this time and time again, what you do is the best way to do it because what you're doing, first of all, it's the most difficult way to do it and you prepare your body for it in a very fucking grueling fashion. We worked out before we got here and you work out every day and one of the reasons why you work out every day, it's fucking going through the mountains is hard as shit.

Speaker 1:          00:31:54       It is. It is hard, man. I never knew until I went with Rinella the first time we went up to the Missouri breaks. We're climbing the mountains for seven hours a day. I was like, oh, okay. This is fucking. This is not going to the gym and getting on the elliptical machine. This is fucking constant and it's all day and if you're packing shit, you have to be strong. You have to be physically strong to do. I mean, you remember in Colorado and we were roughing it up that Ridge. You know we're at the bottom of the canyon. Heard a bull bugling is the bull you killed? Yeah. This dude takes off like a fucking mountain goat. I'm in pretty God damn good shape. And I'm like. And he's like, don't even breathe in as fuck. He gets to the top of the bat. That's how you saw the bowl is at the top of the mountain that you spotted it, but know that that the sun was going down and we had a lot of elements going.

Speaker 1:          00:32:38       I can tell the bull wasn't as good bull just by his bugle and we'd been huffing it down. They're done trying to get on a bowl. That was beautiful and we never could get eyes on him. But then I heard what sounded like a mature bull and the sun going down and that's why you train. Right, exactly. That's exact situation. You're coming out of a hole, you're climbing, you know, 9,000 feet. The air is thin there and it's a race against time essentially. But I mean, we made it work. Yeah, you don't, you, you are able to close the distance in a much more efficient way because of all your training. And uh, that was a good example of. Another good example of it was the packout. I mean we're packing a lot of fucking weight. Yeah, right. This asshole has to fucking elk quarters in his backpack.

Speaker 1:          00:33:21       So it's like 180 pounds. And how much is that heavy? I Dunno. Heavy Shit. And you basically have me on your back and you're walking a mile with this, you know, and there's one, there's a photo. Why have I, I'm sure I have some photos of us from, from this very trip that we're talking about. We're packing these things out. But the point is what you're doing to acquire when you have an elk steak and you sit down with this, and I had this conversation with Remy Warren about it where it's like, it's almost like a religious experience. He's like, this is a precious piece of meat. I've gone into the Wilderness vested, I've harvested this animal and I have a precious piece of meat. And he goes and I treat it almost like a baby, like I sees in this and I cook it perfectly and this is.

Speaker 1:          00:34:01       He has this intensely intimate connection and I do with the animal that we killed that animal that you and I killed when I eat that thing. I think of our time together. I think of how difficult the hunt is. I think of how crazy the environment is, how beautiful the experiences. Oh, you're so much more to it than going into a store and buying a squash. Right? You know, and this is what people need or understanding of state, even beyond what buying a steak shore, but buying even a Vegan or a vegetarian, but your, your vegetables, you're disconnected from these vegetables for the most part. Most people are. Yeah. There is an intense connection with the food that you eat. Even if you grow it yourself, like my wife gardens and I do as well and she does it more than I do, but we'll have salad from something that we grew in our garden.

Speaker 1:          00:34:47       It's awesome man. It's awesome. Like we're chopping tomatoes that we planted those seeds and we fertilize the ground. We watered it and it came up. We pick the tomato, now we're slicing into it and it's a process process and that's where the hunt, that's where the hunt where the training and the preparation and the reverence for the animal and the harvest and the animal and the care of the meet and get to your house and you put it in your freezer and then you thought and you put that whole process is right. I'll agree with remy. There is reverence to and it means so much and for a hunter for and I think, you know, as just being a provider and just being like, oh, we say self self sufficient and doing it is hard. It's a lot easier to go to the store and say, Hey, here's some of my money. Could I have that meat? Thank you. Yay. Somebody else did all, all the stuff we

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       just talked about. Somebody else did that with no reverence and I'm eating it with no reverence, you know? So to do it on your own is. I mean it's, it's why it's what I trained. It's what I prepare for every day and it's a, it just means so much. Well, it's

Speaker 1:          00:35:56       enriching in a very strange way that I never experienced in my life until I started hunting. I'd never had this kind of connection with my food except for me be going fishing, you know. Um, this, uh, last summer I took my kids to Hawaii and my kids love fishing with my little girls. Love it. It's fun because you know they can put a line in the water and when they catch something and then we're cooking it and eating it later, they're like, we caught this and they keep saying like, mommy, we caught this fish that you're eating. Like there's like a primal connection to this thing, but other than that I had never experienced this sort of primal connection to your food and all that nonsense aside. Like there's a difference between a fish and a mammal that just is totally, and there's a. there's a big difference. She. The reverence that you have for, in my opinion, the most majestic of animals that you hunt, which is elk. I think it's the most majestic. They're, they're, they're mythical creatures, man. Crazy

Speaker 2:          00:36:56       elk. Sheep. Sheep are up there, you know where they live and the regalness, but elk is a god just because they're so iconic throughout the west. You know, a big bull elk is just what

Speaker 1:          00:37:09       you know when you envisioned the West envision mounds. You think of a big bull elk and then you say, I'm going to hunt this with my bow. It's intense. It's fucking hard to do two and a goddamn. You forget me. Addicted to this shit. It's a real problem. I'll text him every now and then like I'm in the middle of doing something. I'm like, I wish I was bow hunting. I swear to God. This is boring. I'd rather even just shooting. We shot it. A rubber target today. It was awesome. I have a rubber elk. It sets up my hill and we did a little a facetime video. We were out there doing it, but just shooting it. That rubber is cool now.

Speaker 2:          00:37:40       No, that's what I was saying. You can take anybody. You can take the coolest person you know. Just think, just sit here and think who? Who's the coolest person I know? Or who is the coolest girl? I know. You take that person, you put a bow in their hand and you get them shooting a bow. They're cooler. No, that's my. Yeah. I mean shooting a bow makes you more of a bad ass. I prefer

Speaker 1:          00:38:02       girls that don't like to hunt that way. They don't want to come with me now. I don't want him to have. They don't complain while they're up there and they don't want them to hunt. I just wonder if shoot a bow does screw up my high. No, I'm kidding. I like cism now in hunting. Does it exist? It does next on Oprah? No, I'm Dr drew. He would love that. It would get me on there and just crucifying would lie and he would get a bunch of girls who don't know anything about hunting to yell at you but have a lot of. Did a lot of big opinions. He, when we got back from Brazil, it was right when this whole cecil the lion shit was going down and these people to have a hunter onto yell at essentially and I was telling you don't do it and the first time you didn't do it, I got you to leave.

Speaker 1:          00:38:43       I was in the green room. I was, I was in the green room and again her hair and makeup and it just like wasn't feeling good. Yeah. I'm glad you talked to me. I'm glad we have association. So I left but then I, I did go on. Yes, you did go on later. But it was after the smoke had settled a little bit and you went on with a conversation about ethical acquisition of meat and you know Dr. True eats meat. So yeah, a lot of those people on that show eat meat. Yeah. It's just bizarre. It's a bizarre conversation. I mean that show, whatever they show is around because controversy so well. One of the font can hilarious things in the show was the woman who was saying that the reason why there's not so many grizzlies just because we've killed off all their predators.

Speaker 1:          00:39:29       Right. That means dinosaurs by the way. Saber Tooth Tigers, Grizzly, Jesus Christ. Have you ever seen a grizzly lady? Nothing. Eating them up. Other grizzlies are pretty much the top of the food chain and I think, well we are, but they're not really on the same page that we think we are. They think they are. So there's a little bit of a conflict there. There's a huge conflict. I mean, essentially it's like two different kingdoms. Yeah. There on the top of the food chain and the wild kingdom, we can get them in their world, but we gotta get the fuck out as quick as we can. We can only exist in their world for a couple weeks at the most. And then we're like, okay, we got to get back to a, an actual bed and I need to take some vitamins. Right now it's a, I dunno, it's well, according to a, um, the woman from, um, God damn on my brain is foggy.

Speaker 1:          00:40:19       Did after working out. What's her name from um, like blows your [inaudible] Akins. Sue aiken said that she saw a bunch of wolves run down a young grizzly kill it. Oh, she said the young grizzly was coming out of its den and when they come out of their den they're kind of weak and these, these wolves knew it. So they chased after it and they were biting its legs and then chasing down and it happened like a fucking 100 yards from her house. $100 for my house. It sounds like she lives in La here, right? Yeah. This lady is so bad. Yeah, she's intense. She's the most gangster woman on the planet. She really is. She's. I have massive respect for her. She's just so cool too. She came in and she's. It's not like she's like some weird loner who hates people. She loves people, but she prefers to live in one of the harshest climates on the planet. Two hundred miles above the arctic circle. That's awesome. Just so bad ass. How much tougher she is in probably 99 percent of the men that live here in la. She's tougher than me. Tell you that. This is what this lady did. She got attacked by a bear. Bear tore her apart. Okay. Broke her leg. Broke her hip, cracked her skull. She, they, she had to crawl back to her house. The bear was just fucking her up because she was in its territory. This is bare mauled her right. She, she managed to live.

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       She got back to her house. She was stuck for days where she couldn't walk. Her leg was broken. She was stuck. She couldn't get to the phone. Okay. She couldn't lift herself up. She had a way for someone to find her. So these people, founders like, I think it was seven days later, she got healed up, went back, shot that bear and ate it.

Speaker 2:          00:41:51       There you go. That bitch is so gangster bitch with all due respect. That is amazing. She's so gangster. Well, let, let me expand on something before I get people hating me for a women bowhunters. I love you. I, uh, I actually folks, we are a little bit. I love that women hunt. I love that. I do too. I do. I mean I want it. I'm taking Dana Lesh a bowhunting for bear this year. So I mean, I, I don't have. And I want it, you know, me and eva had been talking about getting together for hunt. So just all joking around. I do like, I do just like people shooting bows. Even. Yes. If you can envision this, if Obama shot a bow, I'd probably think he was cooler and that, that is amazing. That is amazing. Shocky you should say

Speaker 3:          00:42:38       eve is too, by the way. She's the daughter of Jim shockey who's been on this show who's an amazing, fascinating guy who has a show, even if you don't like hunting, there's an amazing show called uncharted and it's. It's barely about hunting. It's really about different cultures and this guy goes to all these discount. Jim shockey is as cool and interesting as it gets. He is just a fascinating, fascinating guy and he travels to these remote places in the middle of a Russia and he went to Afghanistan and he's he. He went to Africa to this remote village that has a massive problem with crocodiles and it was an incredible show. It's an hour long show. I mean, it could be on the discovery channel. It could be on a, on HBO, could be on anything. It just so happens. It's on. Is it on the outdoorsman? Is Channel outdoor channel, outdoor channel and this guy goes to this place and you're seeing these people, like half the people in the village had been mauled.

Speaker 3:          00:43:35       I mean, people are missing arms. They're missing legs. Their faces have been cut open because they're getting killed by crocodiles left and right, and while he was there filming a woman got taken by a crocodile. They've set up these sort of rudimentary fences that they put in place to keep the crocodiles out of these area where these people gather water and you know, and he's there with these other hunters where they're trying to take out once a crocodile apparently starts eating people, but you got to kill it because got a taste for it. Well, they got a taste for it and they realize how easy it is. Like a wildebeest can fuck up a crocodile a little bit, you know, you throw a kick at it and break his jaw. I mean the crocodile is incredibly tough and durable animal, but a wildebeest is a tough scrap. It's a big animal and you know, like a water buffalo, that's a scrap. It's a big animal to work for that. It might not work out a person. God Man, we're made out of Jello, Jello and popsicle sticks.

Speaker 2:          00:44:28       Nothing. Well, and I hunted crocodile. I mean really they are. They're tough. Where'd you hung crocodile in Africa? In Tanzania. I wanted to kill one. And so to get within range of a you have to build a blind and they come up, you know, their eyes are just above the water and for a bow you have like two bumps. They got a bump above the eye and one back here you have to be like right below that are writing between. You're shooting at about a fifty cent piece size. You have to break them because if you hit them in the lungs, they're in the water and then they sink. You don't get them. So if you're going to hunter crocodile with a bow, it has to be brain shot. Drop them. So to do that you have to get them up off the shore, right. And uh, could never happen. Built a blind, had the Beta. It was just like so hard to do that. But uh, one of the guys I was with killed one with a, with a rifle and we ate it. And the meat is amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:45:22       Well, it's supposed to be the highest protein meat you can get, like alligator and crocodile is supposed to be one ounce per ounce, one of the highest in protein content. Amazing. Yeah, I mean it was, it was so good too. But uh, yeah, they, they are, they're smart. They're tough. I don't think they're smart. I think they're stupid as fuck. Well, try to kill him. I just think they know how to not get killed. Like they have a couple of calculations they make in their brand. Is that a person you know? Fuck this dude. Okay. The brain is very small. I'll give you that because it's a small target, but if you're trying to hunt them, you're going to think they're smart. If you're going to do a crossword puzzle with them, probably not that smart. Fascinating though, man. I won't want us. I want, wouldn't give a shout out. Not only to Jim shockey because he is the ultimate savage love gym, but in Love Eva, but their son, brandon brandon is the mastermind behind the shooting of that show, right? He, you know, as far as

Speaker 2:          00:46:16       filming and the production value. And what you see on tv that's brand shockey amazing. And he is, I think he could film like the, the Best Hollywood movie you've ever seen. He could do that. He has that talent and right now he's doing it on the outdoor channel. So that's, if nothing else, go and watch his work. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:38       On that show. And the notion uncharted, uncharted, which is amazing. And the new show, Carter's wars war, Carter's war is all about this guy who's combating against poaching in Africa and it's all about stopping poachers from killing rhinos and elephants and all these different animals that they're killing in Africa. And uh, so it's not really a hunting show as much as it's just a pure conservation show about a guy who's trying to stop poaching in Africa. And it's, it's amazing and gritty and incredibly well documented and shot and just man the, the world of Africa. If you want to watch a documentary, and I've mentioned this before to people, so I'm sorry if you heard it before, but um, our friend Louis Theroux who's been on the show before, who's an amazing documentary, a documentary guy, documentarian from the UK did a show on these hunting in Africa, which is very different from what you did in Africa.

Speaker 1:          00:47:32       What you did in Africa. You went to the actual wild who Africa, not a high fence operation, but these hunting ranches that they have set up in Africa. It's such a catch 22. It's such A. There's so much contradiction going on because on one hand these animals are trapped in this. It's usually enormous, like several thousand Acre area. It can be where they're trapped in these areas and they're hunted and the people call it a can hunt and a lot of people that have a lot of hate for it, but on the other hand, the animals that they're hunting have never been healthier and higher numbers and a lot of them were on the verge of extinction until they started implementing these high fence operations. And it goes back to the same thing we were talking about, the money for conservation, the real money that these people are getting in Africa is coming from hunting.

Speaker 1:          00:48:17       That's what's paying for these animals to survive because so many people are going over there to hunt and people say, well, animals have value exists. The key. And that's so fucking weird concept for people. If an animal doesn't have value, it's probably going to be extinct. Yeah, I mean that's how. That's. That's why. That's why hunter's care. That's why conservation is care because the animal is valuable. Whether it's right, wrong or indifferent. When there's value. People care and people have an understanding today that they didn't have this several hundred years ago. Like when people look at the gigantic mounds of buffalo skulls, that's a perfect example. Why you need conservation. You can't just have people run out and kill these animals that have value with no consequence or with no monitoring of the herd populations and health. That's when you get these horrific mass extinction events like what happened with the buffalo and the buffalo were basically brought to the verge of extinction.

Speaker 1:          00:49:12       Now they're in healthy populations to the point where you can actually, in some places you can hunt wild ones. The same thing could be, say, a set of elk. The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation has done an amazing job of repopulating areas with elk where they were at one point in time, completely eradicated. Well, did you know that when you tuck elk deer Turkey, when you talk about there's more of those species now than there's ever been. Is that true with elk? Because I know it is with white tail deer. There's more white tail deer today then when Columbus landed, but I don't know if that's the case with elk because there's more places where they don't exist. I think like most of the area where like Steven Rinella did a whole show on this recently, but most of the area where elk used to be, they're not, but in the areas where they are, they're in healthy populations.

Speaker 1:          00:50:00       I'm on Jamie. Can you look this up? Yeah, look this up. Look it up about that populations because I'm almost positive. There's more now. See Elk are and probably rinella would dallas. So maybe you know, if he's been on the show, but elk are there, plains animals originally they're pushed into the mountains because the planes, that's where we live. We live where there's water and in the valleys, that's where humans setup their cities and that's, you know, to get user rivers and we need water. So they have been pushed and now they're mountain animals. But now there's elk where there hasn't been out before Pennsylvania, Kentucky and places like that. So maybe they're, maybe they're more places than they've ever been, but I'm almost, I'm almost certain there's even more elk, but whatever the case, I don't even think there are more places than they've ever been.

Speaker 1:          00:50:47       I think it's the ones that are there are in healthier populations in the used to be I think, but I think elk are a lot like a buffalo in that there's one point in time, like hundreds of years ago, they were just shooting the shit out of them. They're almost eradicated. Oh right. I know now they're, they're bounced back and they're healthy everywhere. And where'd that money come from? Cameron hanes. I want to say hunter. Yes. Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation that they've done a fantastic job and then they, they've done, they've been on the forefront of protecting habitat, so that's, I know they've been over 6 million acres protected, I think maybe close to 7 million now or maybe even over. I haven't kept track recently, but that's 7 million acres that can never be used for anything else other than habitat for animals. And that's not just elk, that's deer to elk numbers across six dates. How do we look in there? See, this is across states, but I think, um, maybe we could keep looking.

Speaker 2:          00:51:38       Can we see that in American elk populations dwindled to less than 100,000 by the early 19 nineties now. And that's insane. And now in 2009 grew to 1 million. Thirty $1,000.

Speaker 1:          00:51:49       That's incredible. So the 19 nineties, that's insane. It was down to 100,000 in the 19 nineties. Wow. That's terrifying. But that's, that's the verge of extinction in our lifetime. Not just in our lifetime, but in when we were both men. Yeah. So during that time,

Speaker 2:          00:52:06       totally. No, that can't be right. Is it? No. The early 19, now that's got to be 18 nineties whereas this hasn't it see the lessons of the last word of the first paragraph

Speaker 1:          00:52:16       by 1984 there was an estimated 715,000 elk in North America.

Speaker 2:          00:52:20       No Fred above there. The last word of the first paragraph.

Speaker 1:          00:52:23       Fortunately a toto toto American that less than $100,000 in a 100,000 in the early 19 nineties. So that, that can't be 19 nineties is it? It's an incorrect. That's what he's saying. But yeah it might be, it might be a miss. I think that's

Speaker 2:          00:52:37       yeah. Cause cause cause it says in 1984

Speaker 1:          00:52:41       84, there's 750. So went all the way back right? Yeah. Yeah. That must be a typo. But anyway, so, so that's what dom typo whose, whose fucking go go. What does it say? Go Hunt seat. I don't necessarily trust a lot of these hunting sites for things like that. Like that's A. I trust him when they support the point. I'm trying to fuck up. That's a giant fuck ups. I did email that site. Somebody who's listening, please email that site and let us know fixed. I think it's supposed to be 18 nineties and I would say, and I would say less than 100,000 and now it's over a million. So that's, that's where I get that. The point that I was making, but I think before people colonized the west, I think they were everywhere. I think that's what,

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       that's what Rinella was saying. Maybe. So I think what he was saying was that they're not in 90 percent of the places they used to be in, but the, the places they're in, it's like thriving. They're thriving. Yeah. And this is, this is a really important point when it comes to, like we were talking about grizzly bears, like people say, look, the grizzly bears are almost extinct in Santa Monica. Yes, you're right. They're almost extinct in California. They only live in California, but not a ton in California to Alaska. They're fucking everywhere. And there's a lot of um, folks in Alaska which is twice the size of Texas. It's a goddamn enormous state. And they are, they are big and there's a lot of them, right? And they decimate herds of Caribou elk and they estimate that something around like where John and Jen live in Alberta, more than 50 percent of the Moose are killed at birth by bears.

Speaker 2:          00:54:15       That's where the bears, they follow. So a cow moose is pregnant, it's going to drop, drop the calf. Right? And so bears will know that Moose is pregnant. No, she's going to be dropping a calf. They follow her as soon as she drops a calf right there, kill it and eat it. That's how. That's how they get hurt. They just follow the Moose around.

Speaker 3:          00:54:35       Not even then, a lot of times they're pulling it out of the cow's body. Right? I mean that's how

Speaker 2:          00:54:40       it. They're brutal. I mean, life in the wild. It's not a fairy tale out there. Real deal. It's life and death. And so they're doing, they're just going to kill. They're going to kill. That's all they care about. Throwing a kill. Eat. That's how they survive. So there's nothing wrong with that. No, I'm not. They do. I'm not going to judge them. But uh, yeah, so where I was, I was in um, in 16 in Alaska and you can see a nonresident can kill to brown bear, which are basically salmon fed, grizzly, grizzly bear and three black bear, so he can go up there and kill five bear, which I wanted to do, but don't think that I'm blood thirsty. Thank that. I, I want to help the most and I like the bear meat. So, um, I didn't do it, but I mean that's what killed three.

Speaker 2:          00:55:26       I killed three. But that gives you an example of how many, how many bears are our. And this is by biologists who are paid and who have went to school and with who have studied the carrying capacity of the land and how many animals they determined this. This isn't, this isn't hunters determining this, this is Alaska fish and game. So that's where I have a problem with the people who are, who think they know better than people who this is their passion, this is what they care about. They have boots on the ground, they're doing it. They're, they're setting the bag limits. So you don't know if you don't live there and study this and this has been your life mission. You don't know more than them so.

Speaker 3:          00:56:01       Well their wildlife biologist and by the way, if those populations aren't kept at a healthy level, they send in people that they pay to kill these animals and this is an important factor and this is what we're talking about with California because California doesn't have a hunting season for mountain lions. They have to pay people to go in and kill these mountain lions. They're not just letting them out in lines live. Not if they become a problem, they're taking them out. They just don't want to deal with the backlash. Exactly. That's it. So they're just avoiding the backlash and it's not doing it quietly. It's not for the betterment of the animal or or you know the ecosystem or anything like that. It's just because they don't want to deal with the, with the drama. And then you get these people. Well they were here first.

Speaker 3:          00:56:40       Where were they? Are they were here? No, they weren't. First of all that mountain lions five. I was here way before that fuck. And they as in they come on stop. This is the whole place was covered in ice 10,000 years ago. So shut up. Like what are you talking about? Who is they? What is this word? This is the world we're living in right now. In 2016. And a mountain lion ate this fucking dudes cat. What are we going to do? We're going to just let them out in line. He his kid now because it would, if you leave that kid on the swing and you go into kid fucking answer your email real quick and you come back, your kids not gone and see that fucking tail. Hop over the fence. That's how it works. That's the wild barbecued a turnover. Your Veggie Burger, you know, that kid's gone.

Speaker 3:          00:57:22       Um, Cecil. Alright, so this is the uh, the, this is the billboard that my grandpa. No, my grandpa's name was Joseph. Look at this fucking photograph. There is a lion that is hugging a bear and the lion has a tear rolling down his face and the bear has a tear rolling down his face. And it says they banned the bear hunt. They are all Cecil Save New Jersey barriers.com. Oh my God. For his. Makes me want to punch somebody in the face. What kind of fucking crazy person living, living some weird bubble made this billboard and spent actual human money on it. Yeah. I don't know. Fantasy land if they haven't seen. Okay. They have a giant problem with bears in New Jersey. And this is, this is this facts behind this. First of all, a student from rutgers was fucking killed by a bear right outside of rutgers.

Speaker 3:          00:58:12       He, that photograph student took this photo of a bear just before it killed them. Um, I was talking to a guy who is, who knows rangers out there and they're telling people not to hike. They have so many Goddamn bear in New Jersey. And why do they have so many bear? Because they didn't have a hunt for them. So these God damn things, they got overpopulated and they have now they're, they're entering into residential neighborhoods. And these laundry. Look at this fucking video. Bear fight far rockaway, New Jersey, August 14th of 2014. These bears are duking it out, these are big black bears, like seven foot bears, 400 plus pound bears, and they are going to war in this guy's front lawn. These are huge. I mean if you were in Alberta and you saw one of these bears coming in and you'd be like, Ooh, boy, that's a trophy bear. That's a giant bear. That's hundreds of pounds of meat for the grill. And these bears are in this guy's lawn. I mean, this isn't a, this isn't some crazy rural, you know, Akins living in the middle of the nowhere. No, in this jersey, this thing just knocked over a lamp post and now it's colliding with these, uh, garbage pails. Watch this. They come, they're

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       fighting over territory by the way. That's created by garbage. That's what the territory is. They attack people's garbage and these two bears, they bite each other and then they do get out. Look at the size of these bears. Now, these are huge, right? Well, that's, that's why. Okay, so maybe there was before there's houses that was perfect bear habitat, but guess what? There's houses now. So that means we have to control the bare numbers that's hunting. Well, here's another part of the problem. These bears weren't here 30 years ago. These bears are overpopulating and moving into these neighborhoods and they're doing it because they know that people live there and it's a steady supply of food. Garbage. Yeah. When you live in Colorado. And Colorado is a, they had a big issue with it in this area where I was, where the bears would find out that people put their garbage in a certain area and once they eat there, once that's it, they have to capture those bears and they either relocate them to zoos or, or figure something out.

Speaker 1:          01:00:19       But one, when I was there, we went to this, uh, wildlife rescue place and they had this gigantic grizzly bear that they had gotten because we'll get a fucking giant chunks of further tearing off of each other. Look at that. It's insane. They're bs. And now I love this video because a car pulls up and the cars that they started taking selfies with the bears. But um, they had to relocate this grizzly because it's just started tearing apart people's cars. They found it, found food and someone's car once was at grizzly black. It was a brown bear and it's one that they had had, I don't know where they had gotten it, but, uh, but it happens with black bear. It happens with bears. Yeah. No, it's just, it's just, you know, the numbers need to be controlled. That's all there is to. It doesn't have a large brown bear population.

Speaker 1:          01:01:02       Right, Chris? Well, it wouldn't be brown bear brown bear when they're near the coast and Grizzly, we're inland brown bear. They eat fish. So they're on, how do they call them? Different names, different species, I guess is what they've determined. You know, there are bigger because they fish and they get all that protein. So they, you know, they can be up 1400 pounds. Where as a mountain grizzly in average mountain grizzly might be seven foot 500 pounds. You know, I mean, life's tough or up in the mountains, they're eating blueberries when the blueberries are on, um, you know, eating what they can. But the bears that eat the fish there, gorging on fish, they get big. It's just a high protein diet. Kinda like what you're on right now. I'm on a high protein diet. You're like fat too? Yeah. This, this diet is kind of for the birds but not really. Birds eat grain. I'm enjoying. I mean it's not bad but for two weeks and I really like a bowl of pasta right now, but it's going well. I bet it's interesting. Yeah. Well that whole Cecil and the bear hugging thing that it's insane. Yeah. I guarantee you a woman made that. How about that folks? I'm now. I'm done with. I'm done with that part. I don't know. That may be. It could be a gay guy. Could be a week.

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       Dude, I'll, I'll sex gender, all that nonsense aside. We're joking around here folks. What that is, is just someone who doesn't understand it's, it's crazy ignorance and um, the, the idea that you want to let these things keep fucking and breeding and overpopulating to the point where they're killing college students just outside of rutgers and they're having these two, 400 plus pound bears, duke it out on your front lawn. That's not good folks. It's not good. You know, I'd, I'd like to see these people that think that the bears hugging each other. Go break the, you know, come on guys. Let's settle down. Break it up. Go break those bears up. Up. Since apparently they cry and have emotions. You know, Cecil has a brother who's protecting his family. Jericho. Kay. Go break up that bear fight. Let me know how that goes. What is this?

Speaker 4:          01:03:05       Samantha is from their website. Save and Jay Baer's dot com. Oh God. So this is another name you don't part. I think, you know, we're only facilitating this issue right here with naming the bears that humanizing them, because if you watch the superbowl, it seemed like every other commercial was something an animal seeing foreign animal talking or it's like, I mean, I saw sheep singing in the acapella group. I'm like, what is going on? Well, and so that's, that's where hunters are fighting for our place right now because the kids are seeing that and weak people are seeing that and people that don't get, Hey, I want to be part of the food chain are seeing that and they're like humanizing these animals. Sheep don't care about anything but eating, eating and fucking. Yeah, they do. They stay alive. They're not talking, they're not talking about, oh, here comes a guy who was bringing us our food.

Speaker 4:          01:04:00       Let's see. You know, they're not, they're not. It's not realistic, but that's the, that's the, that's the programming, the programming that's getting out there and just met missing with the hardwire of these young people coming up with A. Well, a lot of hunters attribute Bambi as being a turning point in the way Americans viewed hunting. Yeah, because then all of a sudden you've seen this beautiful animal getting chased down and killed by a hunter. Yeah. And well, we need to fight. We need to fight to change that. I think we are. I mean we are because uh, you know, every time you see a hunter on a show or on a who, I don't even know what it's been on. I think south parks even had something, but it's obviously it's some redneck hillbilly drinking beer, you know, no respect for anything that's always, even in all the Hollywood movies, that's what, that's what they, that's the image they portray. We need to change that. We're trying to, we're trying to. And I think with podcasts and with conversations on the Internet, at least information is getting to people that they weren't getting before. I've had many, many people both on twitter, on my website forum, on facebook, on all these different forms of social media. Say I had a perception of

Speaker 3:          01:05:17       hunters until yet. Guys like Cameron Hanes on Jim Shockey, Steve Rinella, Steven know remy warrant. He's really intelligent people that can talk about Tim Barnett who can talk about these things in a way where they explain to you their perspective, their grew up with this. This is how they've lived their life and if you lived your life in a city, it doesn't make sense to you. It seems alien. You Watch Bambi, you see these Yogi talks to booboo. They have conversations. Why would you want to shoot one of them until you, you. You venture into that world. You don't understand it, and we're. We're insulated from it because of supermarkets, because of this bizarre world we live in. When we've created these artificial structures that we think are normal, these cities and these, these, this method of acquiring food, will you just run a piece of plastic through a machine and you walk away with all this food?

Speaker 3:          01:06:10       It's not healthy. No, it's not. It's not. It's like if you could have sex with a faceless person where you didn't even get to see their face, like all you saw was like their body from the shoulder down and that's what you had sex within you. You had a kid with that person, you even know that kidney and walk away, but I got my needs met. I mean almost. That's almost what's going on. It's almost what's going on when you're acquiring food without ever growing it, without planting that seed, and I'm not saying you should fucking plant all your food and I'm not saying you should only hunt if you're going to eat me, but what I'm saying is if you could do it, it would bring you a little closer to understanding where that food comes from and it'll give you a. A just a broader view of this world we live in and what you're doing by consuming food you are consuming.

Speaker 3:          01:06:57       Whether you consuming salad and here's another thing, vegans. I put this up the other day. I was fucking with a bunch of people where I've trolled. People are sending me all this vegan stuff, so I just started trolling them by sending them all these scientific studies about plants and plant intelligence, which is a new form of study or it's a. it's a new field of study where they're finding out more and more each day that plants can do calculations that they respond to being eaten, that they have a. They have different mechanisms to discourage predation. That's where poisoned plants come from. They are communicating with each other in some sort of strange way that when one tree is getting chopped down, it's sending signals to other trees. It's whether it's an in it's own way in some sort of a weird way. Your reading life, if you're eating a plant, your eating life, if you say that it's okay to eat vegetable life, but it's not okay to eat fish if you say it's okay to eat fish, but it's not okay to eat animals. If you. What you're doing is you're making these bizarre moral judgments and they're, they're based on convenience and there's a lot of them are based on ignorance and a lot of them, they don't hold up. When you start looking at things subjectively and people say to you, what, why don't you eat your dog? Well, I don't want to eat my dog. Okay, Jesus Christ,

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       but my dog as a pet. Okay. My dog was raised from the time it was a baby, have had it since it was young. I'm not going to eat it, but if someone does have a wild dog and eat it and it's between that wild dog eating them and them eating that wild dog, you know, that's an unfortunate situation, but you got to eat that fucking dog. Yeah. Manny Pacquiao is parents. They eat their dog when they were, when he was starving. When you were a kid. It was like a really traumatic moment for him where his family was. So there were starving. They were so poor. They had to eat their pet dog. Yeah. Well, and then the people would say, well, you're not starving. Why are you killing animals? Right. For us, because I don't want to starve. That's a good point. What would I like active?

Speaker 4:          01:08:57       What I liked the most, we talked about changing the stereotype is I like, you know, working as we know workout all the time. I like when people asked me, why are you working out so hard for bowhunting? And this was like that. That is the craziest look, you know? But it's been the same answer for me for years is because I want to be the best in the mountains. I think that the best that you can be the best I can be. Yeah, I understood that way more after I went with you. You know, after I went hunting with you in Colorado, I get it. I get it more because you're in better cardiovascular shape than me and I'm in good shape. You take the average person, I'm in better shape than the average person and I'm not in better shape than you. You're fucking running ahead of me.

Speaker 4:          01:09:34       I'm like, this the fuck I can't catch up. You know, it's like there's a certain pace that you can keep because you run mountains all the time that I'm just not capable of keeping right now. It made me up my cardio and a big time, big time way. When I came back from that hunt was the first thing I started doing is really up in my cardio. Well. And I, you know, so we had a real, you know, real life example of that. What I like as much as that. I mean not, not as much as that because I love being with somebody who is successful and who experiences a hunt and I'm able to share in that. And that's a whole nother thing. It's like I didn't, I didn't kill anything but I was part of your hunt and that meant as much to me is me getting my animals.

Speaker 4:          01:10:15       So we have the whole comradery and you know, it's not every man for himself, it's, we're out there, we're working together, we're, we want to be successful in harvest meeting, take me home to our families. But what I like is people who are inspired, they're not with me, but they see the training and they're inspired to up their game. Like maybe they're, maybe they won't run a 200 mile race or run 10 miles a day or do any of this, but maybe they'll run one mile. You know? And maybe it's making. My whole thing is if you're not making, if you're not making a positive impact, what's your point? What are you doing? I want to make a positive impact on people and that's why I love social media and sharing what I do and hopefully it can inspire others to do more. And that's, that's my motivation daily. Well, there's a great. This is a great time for that and it's a, it's a, there's a great venue or a great a vehicle through social media that didn't exist before. Right. Inspire people and I am constantly

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       inspired by it, you know, and some people get upset, legroom, you fucking post and pooch. So you work. No, he fucking showing off. Like I like when I read the rocks, Instagram, I do, I think 40 million other people do. Also. Deaf fucking guy is up every morning. If he's got to work at seven, he's up at four and he's in the gym and they'll show a photo of his alarm clock going off and it'll show a photo of him in the gym making crazy faces where it's folded sweat and it makes me realize I'm a lazy bitch and it makes me want to get up and work out. Exactly. You know, I mean that's just where there's a community. People want to be inspired. I think they definitely do. I know I do and I know that you've created a community, your instagram page and a lot of ways, and I want to say it's your community, but you have spawned through your instagram page.

Speaker 3:          01:12:00       A lot of inspirational communities as well. I've looked at these other people's pages that follow you and I'll see like the Hashtag keep hammering and they're out doing things and I see people responding their posts, you know, I saw this and it made me go to the gym and I wasn't going to. So thank you for that. And it branches off. It feeds into everybody and it's positive. It's positive for all of us. And at the end of the day, look, you know, you can make all your fucking angry videos and you can make all your angry posts and shit on this and shit on that and, and, and get angry about people you don't even meet. But what is the, what is the message that you're putting out this angry shitty message that you are putting out this angry negative thing? Yeah. Who, who's getting you pumping yourself up or you stay.

Speaker 3:          01:12:42       You're standing on a moral high ground and espousing your, your, your superiority to the world. Like what are you doing? What are you doing? Are you broadcasting that? And you know, who was inspired by that? Nobody. What some people might be to also be like, this guy's a good cut. I want to be a no, I'd never heard. I guess I don't hang around those people because I never hear that. Well, you don't see him. I'll tell you what, when you know, like if you meet one of those people in real life, I guarantee you the conversation wouldn't be like it is in these one sided debates or these one sided broadcast. If someone makes a blogs, angry, shitty blog, like you have a conversation with that person, it's tweets and blogs like especially if they're negative, it's a very ineffective form of communication and negative videos.

Speaker 3:          01:13:24       They're very ineffective because this is a not a real conversation like the way people are supposed to communicate is like you and I talking to each other, you know, even fucking podcasts and a lot of ways. It's one of the things why people get angry because a, there's someone listening to this right now, like you motherfucker. I got something to say and I get it. I understand, but don't get mad at me. If you were here, we would talk, but you're not here. Should we take a few calls? We don't do Colin's thinker. No, it's too hard. You know, the beautiful thing about the internet is everybody has a voice. You can text me about the internet is everybody. You got my number, text me. So that'll, that'll eliminate a lot of people. You know, you can, you can choose what message you put out there. You can choose how you experience life. You can choose like how you, how you interact with people and some people that think they're, you know, this is a new world we're living in this world of social media, this world where anybody can start a blog or anybody can start putting things up on twitter or facebook or whatever. It's a new world and we got to learn how to navigate it better. Well, you know, people, like you said, people can choose.

Speaker 2:          01:14:32       I can choose to. I put up positive. Yeah. You don't think I have negative things happen in my life? Of course. Yeah. I could put a negative probably as much as positive. I'm overcoming all sorts of hurdles all the time. But what's the point? I'm like, I said I want to be positive. I want to inspire people and you know, at the show and in Utah this weekend, um, I was amazed at the number of people that waited a long time to come up and share their story, share their story about losing weight or the success they've had or the, or the impact as a hunter with a bow hunter who, how would a bowhunter make that much of an impact? I have no idea, but it happened and that, I mean, if, if you ever wonder, you know, what's your calling in life? Because I've wondered what am I, what am I doing, you know, when I was young, what's, what, where am I going, what's going to happen? Well, weekends, like this weekend where I saw those people and talk to those people and have that interaction that really drives home I'm doing what I'm meant to do, you know? And that's making a positive impact and I mean that's through bowhunting mean that's it. That's what I do. That's how I met you. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:15:43       I mean I met you through bowhunting and social media. I mean, your, your positive message reached me and we talked about it on the Gritty Bowman podcast, which we, we just did a. We dropped in and did a podcast and impromptu podcasts with these guys. They called themselves the gritty bowman and it's good but good bowhunting podcast, and we sat and we talked about it like I was interested in hunting for a long time before I met Steven Rinella and then when I'm going on different websites and looking at different youtube videos, I saw your stuff and I'm like, oh, okay. Well here's this guy that's really into fitness. He's into fitness and preparing himself to be what you call the ultimate Predator to be your best at what you like to do, which is bowhunting. I'm like, well, this is kind of crazy. So then I started watching your videos.

Speaker 3:          01:16:30       I'm like, what a positive dude. This guy's working out. He's given people great advice. He's telling people like how to use proper technique with archery and how to have a good attitude about this and how it's all good and you're like, it's a beautiful day. We're out here. We're enjoying the beautiful weather, we're out here practicing this, what we do every day, and I was like, this is inspirational and this is positive and and through you, you meet me. I use my what I've created this vehicle of social media and podcasting to broadcast it more and then all these new positive branches spread out from that. It's awesome. It's amazing. I love it. It's so much better than shitting on people. It is so much better than negativity and like I said, when I had these guys from cowspiracy and these guys are vegans, they're vegans who made a documentary about veganism and the powerful message that they had about the anti factory farming message.

Speaker 3:          01:17:21       I had a great conversation with them and I believe, I truly believe that most of these people that are making angry posts on twitter or angry videos, if I sat down with them and had conversations with them, they'd be positive conversations. Whether we agree or disagree. I have a very well thought out point. I would imagine they have a very well thought out point to where they're coming from. It's not a bad thing. It's just this, something is lost in this, the broadcasting of this message. I think that's a real problem that we're all sort of navigating in this world. Is that somehow or another the messages that get the most reaction or a lot of times the negative. Yeah. Yeah, I know well On, uh, in regard to hunting. Why do you like archery? Do you like archery better than rifle? Hunting definitely is more challenging.

Speaker 3:          01:18:12       It's more in. It's there's, there's a book called Zen and the art of archery. It was a book that I need to read. Everybody tells me I need to read this book, but there's something about archery itself like today when we're practicing shooting at that rubber elk. Yeah. There's something about the. There is a, there's a moment when you were at full draw and you're about to release that Arrow where everything is still. Everything is calm and you're not thinking about anything else. You can't other than releasing the perfect Arrow because it requires so much concentration and so much focus. And I was completely unexpected to me. When I first started practicing archery, I thought it was going to be like, like shooting a rifle requires a lot of focus. It requires trigger discipline. You have to like steady the gun arrests do you have to look, you know, really stay still and squeeze that trigger and there's problems with that.

Speaker 3:          01:19:11       You know, you get the shakes, you know, you get nerves and even at a target range, you know, you know the gun's going to make that kick and say you get paid a flint chase. Yeah. It's nothing like archery archery's that times 100. It's, it requires, there's no resting, there's no rifle rest. You know, you have to hold your arm steady and the amount of movement that you make because the arrows only going at the most 300 feet a second, 3:50. If you've got some super bone, a light Arrow, the difference between that and a rifle. Six thousand feet a second, it says arrive. Yeah. So any movement translates to a giant amount of movement at the end where the arrowheads. Yeah. And it's just as a discipline, it's, it's cleansing. Like for me, I love after a long day, I do a lot of Shit, man. I got a lot of things going on in my mind, you know, I have between comedy and podcasting and the UFC and family and the business bullshit

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       and it's like so much bullshit going on. There's so many different things in my mind that for me would archery is, is like, this is like ultimate meditation is ultimate focus point where I draw back and I see that target and then I release that Arrow and then when that, when that Arrow goes right into that bullseye, like we were shooting that rubber elk today and when you nail one it gets right in that small circle. Oh, it's a beautiful, satisfying feeling. It is. It's that moment that in the impact and seeing where it hit. I mean, and then so that's just the process of it. But then when that happens because what, why are we doing that? We're doing that to prepare for the hunt. Yeah. So when all that work pays off on the hunt, it's just, uh, you know, I don't, I don't know how to, you know, I see some videos and I see people running around and tackling each other and doing all that.

Speaker 4:          01:21:05       I never feel like that. I always feel like I'm, I feel, I guess blessed are thankful for the moment and mostly thankful that I made something that's very difficult happen. You know, I achieved that goal and it's a, I dunno, it's, it's so powerful. And I just, that's what I, you know, I like people to shoot a bow because as you said, shooting a bow is, is centering and it zen like I guess if I even know what zen means, I don't even know if I do, but it is relaxing. It is, requires an amazing focus. Um, so that's a good start. But when you can block everything out because you say you have to block everything out to make a good shot on that target, on the foam rubber, the reinhart elk today. Well, on an animal when the animal's moving, there's different factors that at, you know, in line, he's bugling your heart's going a million miles an hour and then when he can do it there and then where you take that up, another level is hunting the mounds, like if your sheep hunting and then you have it's such a physical and then it could be dangerous also.

Speaker 4:          01:22:14       So you have so many things and when that happens on something like a sheep and the sheep mountains, that is to me life changing. I mean experiences like that have made me who I am. When people say, you know, bowhunting has made you who? Yeah, I mean because coming through and crunch time like that is more pressure and more accomplishment than anything I'll ever do in normal life because it's just that difficult. We'll through difficult things are character, gets challenged, our, our, our will and our focus get tested and through those tests and through this very difficult task, you learn more about yourself, right? You learn more about your ability, you learn more about your faults, you, you learn about your weaknesses, you learn about your and you learn

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       how to shore up those weaknesses and get stronger, and that's why people who have never experienced it don't understand your dedication to fitness, don't understand your dedication to making sure you're in the best possible shape you can be. Also that your your archery practice is that the best it can be so that when that moment of truth arises, you can steady your nerves. You can keep it all together and you can execute and that execution, that that is an insanely difficult tasks that very few people have to ever do anything in life that's remotely as difficult as shoot an Arrow at an elk. It's 50 yards away and wash that arrows sink right into the vitals and realize that you've done it and realize that now you have enough meat for a year for your family, one animal, one animal, and are we quantifying life? I mean, are we saying that you know this, that all animals are worth something that will.

Speaker 1:          01:23:56       If that's the case, every pasta bowl that you eat, you eat a bowl of pasta. That pasta comes from grain. That grain most likely was chopped from a field from a combine that is 100 yards long that it's indiscriminate and it's running over everything as we were talking about running over mice and rabbits and fonts and ground nesting birds and anything else that might be in its path and there's a lot of death involved in that, so every bowl of pasta that you eat, even though you feel like you're completely immune and we're a completely free of any responsibility of death, it's not true, but one elk with one arrow feed you for a year, a year, right? Just I have to fucking commercial freezers in the back. They're filled with me. I gave Gary Clarke the musician the other day. I came to pounds of elk, like take this home and cook it.

Speaker 1:          01:24:42       They'll bird the other day said he sent me this text message that he made elk Chili. I gave him some advice. I give people meet. I love it. Love it. Love it. Yeah. My friend Chris Ryan sent me this photograph, or Dunkin actually sit with Chris. Ryan did too, but Duncan sent me this photograph of his, his girlfriend made meatballs, elk meat balls and they were sitting there eating with their friends. They had a friend over for dinner with some meat from an animal. That was, that. You're given it to them. It's, it's, it's fantastic. It's a beautiful warm feeling and it connects you in some weird primal way that we're immune to. We're not getting it anymore. We're not getting it. And it, for me, people asked why? Because I've always been drawn to, to wild places. Um, big wild places and people ask, how did that start?

Speaker 1:          01:25:30       For me? How that started was I didn't come from anything. I didn't have, I didn't have anything. I was just a guy who couldn't even afford an elk license for was $25. I couldn't afford it, but. So I felt like, um, I don't know. I didn't feel special in any way. I didn't feel like I had any advantage over anybody. I felt lower class essentially, but in the wilderness when I went there could be the richest guy in the world. There could be the most powerful businessman, but if he was there and I was there, all of a sudden the playing was equal

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       and if I'm in better shape than him, I'm above him in the mountains. I can be somebody I can be, I can be special and that's how our prepare. And that's why I liked it back there is I didn't have to conform to society's, well, this guy's an a list or you are nothing. You know what I mean? That's what it was always drawn me to that because it was a level playing field for me and if I came in more of like a beast than somebody else, all of a sudden I was the guy back there. That's what I did and it was just like I didn't have anything and I thought this is the only way I'm going to be achieved. My dreams, you know, get to get to where I can be in control. Well, it gives you an understanding

Speaker 3:          01:26:46       of that environment. That environment really doesn't care that you make six figures, doesn't care that you drive a bmw. It doesn't care that you have a nice house. It doesn't care. It doesn't care. This is. There's a lot of ways like I gravitate towards absolutes. I go, that's one of the reasons why I like martial arts. It's one of the reasons I like pool, like that ball drops in the whole. It's because he made it dropped in the hole. If you miss, you miss and there's no if, ands, or buts about it. It's an absolute thing and I think a lot of ways hunting is similar in that way. I get doesn't care. Like if you're playing pool and you're a millionaire and you're playing against a guy who was $2 in his bank, it doesn't. The balls don't know this. They don't care and it's the same in the woods when you were out there and you're in that environment.

Speaker 3:          01:27:30       That is an absolute environment and absolute also in the fact that if you fuckin zig when you should have zagged and you run across a sow, grizzly and her cubs and she just decides today's your day. It doesn't, it doesn't. They don't give a fuck if you host the UFC, that bear doesn't give a fuck. If you know, you, uh, you know, you're the CEO of your company and you're out there. It doesn't care. No. The wilderness is its own world. It has its own, it's an unforgiving. It's unforgiving. And it's absolute. Yeah. And like that Arrow hitting the artery or hitting the vitals of, of an elk I give you. If it doesn't hit, it doesn't hit. I mean, it's got to go where it's supposed to go or are you fucked up?

Speaker 2:          01:28:10       You know, and there there's a, you know, that is real. I mean, it's, that's not just in this talk, not talk where he zig zagged. Um, and you know, Roy Roy story is a perfect example of that front and explained who roy is. Um, roy is, he's who got me started in bow hunting and he is the toughest man I've ever met. I've shared more experiences with Roy and the mountains these life defining type experiences that, that we've talked about. And you know, the bond we've created together has been over a handful of experiences, you know, and you, you realize when you're out of your comfort zone like that and when you're both so committed to a pursuit, those bonds formed quickly, you know. And so we've formed a strong bond over a handful of experiences over a couple of years will really. And I, um, you know, we went to high school together, we started bowhunting as you know, I think 18, 19 years old and had hundreds of experiences, life changing life, defining experiences together over the year.

Speaker 2:          01:29:15       So our bond naturally was like brothers and um, you know, he, he was, when everybody doubted me, when I was growing up and doubted my dream of ever becoming anything he never did. He was always, he was always the guy that believed in me. Well, this year of sheep hunting, he was up, she punted where we had sheep hunted before together and I killed a ram and it was, you know, it's a, it's a tough, difficult, dangerous hunt and he, but he's more prepared or he was more prepared for hunting like that than anybody in the world. He's done it. He's done it as much as anyone that I know and I've been successful. I think he's killed, had killed nine rams and he one misstep. He fell and died, um, prime of his life, essentially 49 years old. I'm just, you know, as a father, husband, three kids, somebody who even the toughest Alaska hunters looked up to one step gone.

Speaker 2:          01:30:23       And that's, you know, that's. So, it's not just talk. When you say zig zagged, there's risk. But that's, I mean, if you're going to it, it just puts everything in perspective. That's the allure to it. Because I can speak for Roy and I because I know we, we always have known about the risks. That was part of the draw is we wanted to go where nobody else wanted to go or do things that nobody else wanted to do. That was the only thing that made us different and it goes back. That made us different. That's, and it goes back to the level, the playing field. Well, we felt like, well, if we would go and do the hardest hunts and the toughest conditions, nobody else would want to do that, but we would, all of a sudden we were calling the shots, we don't call the shots, the mountain calls, the shots and all that.

Speaker 2:          01:31:11       That hunt the mountain. One at Roy fell and he died and it's a file 700 feet, right? Yeah, yeah. It's uh, you know, that where he fell just tough, unforgiving sheep country. And um, you know, once you, once you start going there, you're not going to stop. And um, it's one of the most dangerous hunts sheep. Yeah. Yeah. It's uh, you know, on that hunt specifically, they give 100 tags and a lot of times there's this one sheep killed. It's that difficult in and I think 40 percent of the people never even go because of the weather because of the conditions because it's so hard. So they draw the tag and don't even get up the hill. It wasn't a. That was the case with you when you went up there? Grizzly hunting,

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       you were supposed to go sheep hunting as well, right? Yeah. Well now it's moose hunting, Moose Hunt. We were going to do a moose sheep Combo, but there's so much. No, we couldn't even get to sheep country and that was a plan. We're going to go sheep hunting. And that was with Roy. That was with Roy. Right. So we had, you know, an amazing moose hunt together and I killed a nice big bowl. Um, we just had just a, just another epic adventure, something, you know, a haunt that maybe a handful of people would want to do because we were so far back, you know, miles back and had to haul a moose out over a mountain in the snow. A very, very, very difficult. Huh. But the ones, it was just, it was perfect because it's our last hunt together. He died two weeks later and that hunt and capsulated everything about us, it was just hard.

Speaker 4:          01:32:51       It was miserable and it was rewarding. And, and you know, we achieved success were not very many people would have and we did it together and uh, yeah, I mean, and then two weeks later, years was his sheep hunting. There was an iconic photo that I think it was forever going to define you from that hunt with you with a big cut in your face and blood streaming down your face. And you sent it to me while you were out there. Yeah. You were, you're saying we haven't, we haven't gotten one yet. Yeah. We're out here hustling. And there's this photo of you looking grizzled is fuck with blood coming down your face. Snow in the background. Yeah. And I'm like, uh, yeah, that's, that's Cameron Hanes. It is. Because in enrolling it would, we would always say we can make an easy hunt hard because we want it to be hard.

Speaker 4:          01:33:43       But you went into an area where very few people were having success and even with rifles, you're going deep, deep into area. It was a rifle area, so that means you have. Hunter had a different size of animal that was legal if you're hunting with a. So if you're hunting in this area, it was a rifle area, had to be a little bigger so I had to be 15 inches wide but had to have for Brow Tine switch. So you're, you're, you're making it harder. So we were there and there in the rifle area and we got it done. And it was, it was the hunt that it was a hunt that that's what we love. We loved hard. We just loved the test. No. When you go out there and there's a bowhunter have different standards in a rifle hunter. Like if you were there with a rifle, would you have to have shot a bigger bowl?

Speaker 4:          01:34:25       No, that was I, I went to the bigger area. I went to the big area. So in, in the bowl area, it only has to have three brown times the Moose in the rifle or it had to have four, so I had to find one with four. Well mine had five on one side for him and another, so it was good and it was over 50 inches wide, so as it was league all the way around. But if I would've just focused on the area, it could have been a lesser bullet in regard to time. But uh, and they do this to make sure again, that the mature animals are harvested so that the younger animals can breed. And so this is all calculated by wildlife biologists to make sure that they have healthy populations

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       of these animals. Just a mature bull has served his purpose, so to speak. He's bred the animals over the years. He's probably on the decline, so it's a perfect time to take them out. So that's not what people, you know, people associated almost instantly with, oh, you're full control of your own and the, Oh, you just want a bigger rack. But they do that specifically because it's for the health of the population of these animals. Yeah, I mean we, you know, we, we care about the animals we care about and do like to kill a big animal, but there's dual purpose. We want to kill a big animal because it's a, it's awesome. It's hard, it's hard, they're smart, they're wiser and older, mature animals, especially with the bow. So that's hard to do. And then also on the dual purpose side is it helps the health, the health of the herd.

Speaker 1:          01:35:48       So we're, you know, we're doing the best we can, but most of all, uh, you know, when you go back to, uh, to bow hunting in general is just for me, it's just the tests, the ultimate test is something that's very hard. And that's the draw. Yeah. And that, that hunt also really exemplifies why your hard work is so important. First of all, you shot the moose at 90 yards, which is an incredibly. We were shooting today at 45 yards and as far as, fuck, I never said how far I shot that Moose. I just tell people. Sorry, I'll listen to, I mean, you know Tim Gillingham, we're talking about on the Gritty Bowman podcasts who is a world champion Archer who was talking about routinely shooting animals over a hundred yards and then he does this because he's a world champion Archer and he can do that when you're shooting a Moose, the distance that you can shoot a moose versus a guy like me who by the way I still shoot every day but I just, I can't do that.

Speaker 1:          01:36:39       I'm not, it's not an ethical distance for me, but it is for you and to have to haul that animal out. Sorry to blow up your spot on the yard. I thought you already told people but it was the perfect shot, right? I mean, but that's a, that's a funny area with, with a shooting. Something like a rifle shot at 91st meal, deer mule deer right there to your left. That was 200 yards. It was the first time I ever pull the trigger on anything. Yeah. Anything. Right. And that was 200 years, but of the rifle, that's normal. You get, you get arrested with a rifle, you just thrown on my stomach. The whole thing was perfect. Yeah, I mean the rifle is a tool. You just let her perform. It's going to work, you know, the bow hunt with a bow. It's just a lot of, a lot of variables. So all of your preparation is shooting every day for years and decades really. And then also your physical fitness to be able to pack out. I mean a moose is how big, how many pounds of that thing way. We had about 600 pounds of meat. Just the meat, just the meat. I mean, how much did the animal way? Oh, I dunno over. I mean 1200 pounds. Probably a thousand. I don't know. It's an enormous, enormous animal. Until you see one, like in, you're there physically next to it, you don't realize. No, it

Speaker 2:          01:37:55       took us hours to break, you know, I killed it. Um, it was in the evening and uh, Roy and I, we had cameraman there, but they ended up, they found a little bit of the, the process of breaking it down. Then they headed back to the spike camp in a row and I stayed there, which we like just doing it by ourselves back there together, saying in just saying he would always say, I don't really, uh, what kind of stuff would be saying no country girl Shaker for me. Little Luke Bryan, maybe little little, uh, Lady Gaga. I. Oh God, Yeah. He, he, he was a well versed, terrible singer, but it was, it's just what we did, right. It was also part of the part of the deal. You were happy. Oh, successful hunt. It was, you know, God, you know, I'm just gonna I'm gonna miss those times with him because uh, it's just hard knowing that the journey we'd been through together.

Speaker 2:          01:39:03       That's why it's so appreciated. And you know, who else? No, there's another example. We hunted this year and hunted the Brown bear together and uh, he, he, uh, I killed this bear. The sow went over and was attacking the corpse of the bear, but the bear died. She didn't know what was going on. She smelled blood. Just went crazy. The, these brown bear are there, big predators. And something goes in their head, it's going to have an issue. So she hurt. When I shot the bore, it made a noise. It sorta ran towards her. She stood up, didn't know what was going on, knew he'd made this noise. So she ran towards where he was. Well, as soon as she hit his path, she smelled the blood from where my arrow past thrown. So she tracked him by the blood, just basically running, smelling blood, blood, blood.

Speaker 2:          01:39:56       She got to him and he had died already. She started attacking him. This is just what they do. These are, you know, these aren't crying, hugging bear. And uh, so she's gone and I'm, I'm with rolling on. Like I said, she's turned on my bed and I'm like, God my bear. And I'm yelling to her. I'm like, you know, so I tell Roy on, like I said, we've got to get up. I said, shoot out there. So he shoots boom. And she's like, didn't even know he didn't shoot at her. He was making the noise, just a scare. Nothing. Now I'm like, Hey, get off that there. And she looked up and then she liked, saw us, all of a sudden here she comes, sprinting, and it was like, what is going on? And uh, she's like a blood friends. Yeah, just, it was so much going on at one time and then it got something triggered in her head and she was just crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:40:47       So here she comes and I killed my bears in a creek. She got to the creek and Roy says, he says if she doesn't stop long enough to shooter. And I said, yeah. So she comes up to our side of the creek. Now I have an arrow knocked and you know, I don't know what I'm going to do with an Arrow, but it's, I don't have, I never pack a gun. So I just had my bow and he had, he had the gun, she stands up at 20 yards away and we're standing there and it's in, it's a standoff. And so we think, well, she stood up, she going to see what's going on. Um, there was three of us standing there and she's going to say, okay, dropped down and leave. So we're like, get out of here. And uh, she drops down bee line right towards this charging and so roy boom, and he, uh, he drops her, you know, one shot made a good shot.

Speaker 2:          01:41:36       He hit like Mr. Head, but hit like right here and it was folded or right there. And it was, what the law stands out for me is that, um, you know, we were out, we were never worried about our lives were at stake, were never worried about. And you know, like maybe a typical reaction to be like, oh my God, we could have died or something like that. I, I was just like, I can just because I'm like, I was mad she did that and required Roy to act, you know. So I was just, I cussed and he's like, he's like, dude, I had to. And uh, so we were worried about ourselves. We were just, we didn't want to have to kill another bear and we weren't nervous about the situation. And I'm like, I said, I know. And it was like, where else am I going to have somebody that's on that same page with me that, that's common, that situation and not see their life flash before their eyes, just do what you have to do to, to stop the risk.

Speaker 2:          01:42:37       That's never going to happen. I'm never going to have somebody like that in my life again. And I think about we were, you know, we, we knew the risk, we're involved in everything that we did and we embraced it and we're fine with it and it, and it didn't consume us or anything. And that's what I'm going to miss is having somebody. So on my same page that I can trust like that, you know, Roy was about, you'd have to have someone who's experienced that as many times as Roy has had where it was, he knew exactly what he had to do in that moment. Yeah, he did. And he said, people know what they have to do. It's, it's executing. That is what's hard, you know. And, uh, so knowing what it takes, not panicking, being in control and then getting the job done with one shot, very rare and he was so roy in those situations was, as you know, I don't know everybody, I haven't been with everybody, but I would say he's as good as anybody that I know of, you know, and uh, um, that's why, you know, when he fell and I got the news that he fell and died.

Speaker 2:          01:43:48       I mean, I could, I could believe it, I guess, but I was mad and I'm still mad. Um, and I know everything happens for a reason and I know, you know, he has, he has a lot of faith and I know, you know, we want to think everything's gonna be okay and we'll see each other again. I know all that, but it still makes me mad, um, because, you know, we missed or we missed out on a lot of experiences we'd still love to have. And we talked about and we were just like, we had these big, big goals and big dreams. And I'm mad that that's gone.

Speaker 1:          01:44:29       So it's completely, it's not, it's not just understandable, it's, um, it's something that very few people could probably relate to the kind of intimate friendship that you would have with someone who's experienced those kinds of hunts. It's been in the, in the wilderness that's done like that Moose hunt that you were talking about when you guys were deep, deep in the, in the wilderness like that. It's, it's something that very few people will ever. Very few people ever experienced that kind of danger, that kind of an intimate moment in the wilderness. Just that connection to the wild that you guys had together.

Speaker 2:          01:45:10       Right? And so the whole point, I guess with all that is it's people say, well, you just, your murderous or you want to kill such a small part of what me and really experienced together. The kills were. I mean they were, we achieved our goal. That was it. It was the journey. It was the Brotherhood. It was, you know, growing up. And that's what, that's what hunting is. It's not just you're out killing, it's, you're experiencing nature, its most brutal or it's most rewarding or the entire gamut. And when, when that makes you who you are, um, it's powerful and that's, you know, that's hunting

Speaker 1:          01:45:57       was to us. Yeah. There's a lot of people that are listening to this. I'm sure they're like, well, you know, why is that? Why should you feel any worse for your friend than we should for the animals that you killed? You know, there's a lot of people that they sort of connect animals almost with people in a way or maybe even better than people in a way. Maybe it's this and I think that's a good part of this disconnect that we're talking about. These people that they don't experience these, these moments. They don't, they don't know anybody like that. They don't have a friendship with someone like Roy that they haven't had these experiences like you did with him. Yeah. It's, um, I mean, what you said, you sent me the text, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but you sent me the text when, when he died. And I knew, I knew that that had to be

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       devastating to his still is. Um, yeah, I, I mean, I don't think there's a, there's very few men like Roy, uh, he was, he was a capable, um, he was, uh, just somebody you could count on, anybody could count on and I'm just, you know, tough to replace what's very easy to get by in this world today. It's very easy to get by without being that kind of a person and it's very difficult to become that kind of a person to always make the right decisions, to always push ahead, to always, always show character. To always be someone that you can count on is hard. It, yeah, it's a society today is too easy, I believe. And so, um, that's why I think that's kind of the draw for me to pushing myself the way I do physically, mentally. I don't, I don't like if something's easy, I don't, I'm not attracted to it.

Speaker 4:          01:47:50       I'll, I'll want to, I want to be hard. I want it to be hard. I want it to be difficult. And um, because society makes us weak, it makes us feel entitled and I don't like it. Um, I don't, you know, every day I feel like unless I'm beat down or tired or whatever, I don't feel like I, I achieved what I needed to achieve that day and it's just, you know, I, I can't expect anybody else to feel like that. That's just me. Everybody else is motivated, motivated by different things, have different priorities. I'm just for me and uh, it's, you know, and, and so finding somebody who have the same mindset as me can be tough. It's very rare. It's, it's hard for people to gravitate towards challenge, but through challenge you get the greatest reward because through staying in bed, like there's, there's the call of the bed is strong, the warm bed and just, Oh, let me just hit fucking snooze and this alarm clock and get nine more minutes.

Speaker 4:          01:48:53       Or let me just shut it off and call in sick to work. Let me just not do what I'm supposed to do. Let me just sleep. And there was an article that I posted recently where they were talking about, um, the power that dopamine has dope, mean meaning memories. And it's one of the reasons why people have such a hard time kicking bad habits is because we gravitate towards these like reward experiences that we have in our head. The reward of eating shitty food or have a drinking too much, or it's your, your mind sort of carves these paths towards these real rewarding, like a almost self destructive behaviors because those, they give you a dopamine, whether it's eating shitty food or whatever, but it's the rare person who's mind gravitates towards the reward of accomplishment through reward of pushing yourself through a very, very difficult circumstance.

Speaker 4:          01:49:46       Very difficult to get to that feeling of accomplishment like you get. I'm sure when you run a marathon or like you get when you get to the top of the mountain, when you pushing, when you don't want to and you get to it and you did it and you know that you overcome this weakness inside of you that wants you to quit, right? That everybody experiences at some point in their life and it's a matter of how you react to that experience and how you react to that. That poll, the poll towards the bed is strong, pull towards weaknesses, strong because it's so easy to do. It's so easy to quit. It's easy to quit. It is. See it all the time. That's one reason why, I mean it seems minor, but you know, when I get up at four or five in the morning, I have to be at work at seven, but when I get up early to do my fasted cardio runs, um, and I'm out and so I have no fuel.

Speaker 4:          01:50:36       I'm out there. There's nobody out four or five in the morning and I'm running into the neighborhoods by my house. All the lights are off. I just envision people in their comfortable sleeping and I feel like, you know, it's, it's, I feel, I feel the best. Then when I, you know, it's like when I run the mountain, when it's sunny, I don't feel as good as when I run it, when it's pouring rain because it's easy to go out and do it when it's sunny, if I run, you know, it on a weekend in the middle of the day. Lots of people out there, I don't feel that accomplished when I do it at four or five in the morning when nobody's out there and it's just like that in my head and I, my head might not be normal, but I, I just love, you know, and people always say, well, you know, all that running your, you're going to be in a wheelchair by the time you're 60.

Speaker 4:          01:51:25       And I'm like, who's guaranteed to live to 60? I mean, I might die tomorrow, you know, so what am I supposed to do? Save myself for what I, I, I want to know that I gave all I have every day because tomorrow's not guaranteed. So I mean, I just don't get it. I have a hard time with that. That mindset of the, the moderation mindset, those people that are saying that they're peering through the curtains while you're running by their house, their sleeves gonna, he's gonna wind up in a wheelchair and not me, I'm here Martin. I don't know. I mean, it's, uh, you know, so some people, some people criticize and maybe maybe I will be on a wheelchair, but I'll know that I lived as hard as I could live and, and pushed as hard as I could when I could do it and I'm not going to regret it. Yeah. The people that try to knock someone down for working hard and overcoming extreme obstacles, what they're doing is they're responding to their own insecurity. I mean, there's logical things. There's people that's, you know, there's, there's people that look at certain types of extreme sports where, you know, there's a bmx guy, what's his name, Dave Mirra, who just committed suicide, horrible, horrible tragedy, you know, husband, father, the whole deal. Um, I gotta

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       think it's connected to head trauma. And um, I think you're talking about a completely different thing when you're talking about head trauma because you know, these poor guys that do these extreme sports, they wind up getting really banged up and that causes some pretty severe depression. So I think in circumstances like that, I think you're talking about a kind of a different animal, but people will criticize people who take chances in life. People will criticize people who work hard, you know, like why do you have to lift weights? Why do you think there was an article that we had talked about at some asshole at written in some bowhunting magazine about you. It online. Yeah. Well, whatever it was, you know, he was just talking shit about you. Like why does he have to, you know, you don't have to lift weights like this guy, you don't have to.

Speaker 3:          01:53:29       This is ridiculous. But guess what? Yeah, you do. If you want to do what you can do, you have to. Yeah. It mean. And what he's doing by writing that is looking at someone who works harder than him, accomplishes more than him and he's trying to chop you down. And that's crabs in a bucket, man. That's people. Do you ever see crabs in a bucket? If you don't know what I'm talking about, folks, if you see crabs in a bucket, they never get out of that fucking bucket. Because if they work together, one crap could stand on another crab and the other crab grab on the top and then they could figure out a way to push that bucket over and they get all get out, but nope. What happens is one crab tries to get to the top and the other crabs pull him down and that's what a lot of people are.

Speaker 3:          01:54:04       A lot of people are crabs in a bucket and it's just a weakness and an insecurity and a lot of times it's because they don't know anybody like you. They don't know anybody like Roy. They don't know anybody that can push them. They don't know anybody that they can. They can look at their friend and they could say, you know, this motherfucker can do it. I can do it too. If this guy, if I know what he would do right now. He's like, here's a funny story. I was in Texas with Aubrey and we were pig hunting and we were in this fucking moves, reliable environment. There was so many mosquitoes. It was brutal. I mean, we were just getting mauled. By the end of the day. I mean, it looked like I had some kind of crazy disease, like my whole body was covered in mosquito bites and I thought to myself while I was out there, if campaigns was out here, he would fucking keep going.

Speaker 3:          01:54:54       He would just deal with the fact that mosquitoes are biting him and he would keep going and rob said, how the fuck did you get through all those mosquitoes? And I said, I thought if campaigns was out here, he would keep going. He goes, that's hilarious. Because I thought if Joe Rogan can do it, I can do it without even be there pushed me and me because I kept going. It pushed him, but we were, it was fucking miserable. We were, there's this cloud of mosquitoes we just swarmed on. Well, you know, I mean it's, you know, it is a funny story but I do in some way feel responsibility to the people that follow me or look up to me to not give up. I know people look to me for inspiration and you know, and, and it helps. It's like when I don't feel like doing something, I think about all the people who

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       expect me to. I mean I have a huge drive to do it myself, but it's just like sometimes those little things and thinking about, you know, this story with you or people who have lost a hundred pounds thinking about, you know, the work I put in, it's like all those things have made me who I am. So it's a, it's not like I, I think about specific stories, but I think about all the people who have been such a positive message, a positive impact on me because I guess I haven't on them, you know, so can return it and it makes me, you know, it like the, like the big foot $200 that I'm doing. If I'm just on my own and nobody knows who I am, I'm much less, much less, a much are not as tough a muscle, a less resilient as the guy I'm going to be who will line up to run the big foot 200 and August because I'll feel like I'll have an army of people helping me push me and I just think that that's, you know, as a society that's a type of things we need to focus on.

Speaker 1:          01:56:49       I believe. So inspiration to two way street. Yeah. When you inspire people, those like I do these meet and greets after shows you all the time and I can't tell you how many people have come up to after show that say I lost 100 pounds. Once I started listening to your podcast, I started eating healthy. I started looking at my body in a different way and I started realizing like I will be happier if I took care of myself and then I'm happier when I do force myself to exercise and now I do it everyday and I'm drinking Kale shakes and I'm eating healthy foods and I stopped drinking and all this and it makes me feel better. I mean, I think about it when I work out, I quickly. That's where inspiration is a two way street and then it's also what we were talking about, like you've created a community through your, your social media and through the the positive posts that you make and through through all your actions and all the different things you've done, you've created this sort of sense of community where all these other people, they feed off of that and you feed off of them and we all feed off of each other.

Speaker 1:          01:57:44       Yeah, no, it's through this podcast to, man, this has been a nuisance, an inspirational podcasts. I'm going to listen to this podcast when I workout tomorrow. Yeah. When I. When I do my morning workout tomorrow, I'm going to put this on my headphones and I'm willing to listen to this. I'm going to listen to specifically to the story about you and Roy. Yeah, and that, you know, people want to be that kind of person. You know, people don't want to be a lazy fuck who criticizes people for no reason. They don't. They don't want to be that guy that's weak and that talk shit about someone when they're not there because they feel bad that that person is out there working out. Well, you don't want to have to do with Kim Haines. Dude, shut the fuck up. You know what you're doing, bitch. You know what you're doing. When you're doing that, while you're doing it, you know what you're doing. While you're making those, you know there's a little sneaky voice in the back of your head unless you're completely obtuse, unless you're completely oblivious to the way you interact and interface with the world, you know what you do and when you say those things, he tried to chop someone down because they make you feel weak and instead of saying, this guy is out there doing something awesome instead of just what's what's negative about someone working

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       out and being healthy. What's negative about someone who values physical fitness and accomplishing difficult goals? That is the essence of character. That's the essence of what's inspirational about a person. I'm not inspired by someone who sleeps till two. I'm not inspired by someone who can not eat shitty food and loves to smoke.

Speaker 2:          01:59:01       Inspired by discipline, discipline. I love discipline and as you talked about, the rock guys like the Rock and the rock is out to $40 million. You get out to how many will listen to this podcast? I mean,

Speaker 3:          01:59:15       I don't know, but it'd be more than a million for sure. Millions. So over the course of how many years this is out there in the world, right?

Speaker 2:          01:59:22       So I'm inspired by you, the Rock and so in my own little bowhunting world, I just try to live up to that and, and you know, I guess what I wanted, I want to thank you for giving me this platform, given me access to all you've created here because, you know, as we've talked about, that's what feels good to reach people, inspire people, and yet maybe they'll be inspired maybe even a little by the heartbreak of losing a good buddy, you know, maybe to be a better friend or maybe to be somebody who, uh, I don't know, that integral part of somebody else's life. Maybe that'll inspire them. Maybe the workout part, who knows, maybe it'll be a better, uh, I don't know, more understanding to the vegans and be able to explain it better. There's so much you can take from this podcast and without you giving me this microphone, it would never happen. So I want to thank you and, uh, I'm so grateful. Uh, I've just, I'm so happy I've met you and now we've created this friendship.

Speaker 3:          02:00:19       I couldn't be more happy myself. And again, that inspiration is a two way street. This podcast doesn't exist if it's not for other people, mean what all I am is like an antenna or something. Just broadcasting my thoughts and other people's thoughts too. And without a guy like you to introduce me to something like bowhunting, I would have no idea. I would've gone to my grave without having any idea how rewarding it is to go and get my own meat through archery in the woods. How difficult it is to pursue such an incredibly, incredibly demanding discipline. And what that's about and for you being inspirational and for you creating those videos, you reached me and in you touched me with your positivity and with your, your inspiration and with your dedication and focus. And I live for that man. I live for inspiration. That's my fuel. I love it. I love inspiring people. I love people that are inspiring me and I love inspiring other people. I love inspiration. I think it's one of the most, one of the most powerful aspects about our new found ability to communicate with each other, right?

Speaker 2:          02:01:24       Social media, so you can. You can be a negative anchor or you can inspire, so yeah, maybe that's the message of the podcast today. Just get out there, like I say, make a positive difference and it doesn't have. We can all do. It doesn't have to be big. It doesn't have to be to 40 million, 10 million or a 1 million

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       Haggen Beto one guy. Yes. Make a positive difference. We can all do it and we can all do it in our own way and it's the better way to live. It's the better way to live this. This world that we're living in right now is essentially a global community that is coming to awaken. It's aware of itself now in a way that's never been a before. We can communicate with each other like you know, there's this strange new time where you can. You could seek out shit that pisses you off. You can see you could just fucking spend all day on Kanye West instagram page and get angry.

Speaker 1:          02:02:16       You can just scour through all of the worst aspects of all sorts of different people, or you can choose to be inspired. You can choose to live your life in a powerful and dedicated way, but there's only one way to do that is through action. It's a choice. Yeah, it is a choice man, but it's a good choice. It's a great choice to make. It's way through that choice. You enrich yourself and enrich the other people that you've come in contact with and then we're strong or a stronger as, as as society. You know we're not perfect. People folks know we're all we all fuck up. We all get mad when we shouldn't get mad. We all falter and through those lessons of failure, sometimes the disappointment you have in yourself when you come up short is the fuel you need to make sure you never come up short that way again and maybe you'll come up short and another way next week.

Speaker 1:          02:03:09       You know? Well, that fucking thing is never going to happen again either. And you find a way to assess. Yeah, it is a process and that's one of the things that I really try to drill into people's heads. You know, they go, Oh, can you? How have you done so many things? I've done so many things because I've sucked at all of them. Everything I've ever tried, I sucked at in the beginning, everything you fail and then you learn how to not fail and you, you know, how do you, how do you do that? Will you take God damn chances? That's how. That's how you start a bow hunting at 45. You got to fucking take chances. And if you don't take chances, if you stay within your comfort zone, man, that's not a fun life. Now, it's not a, it's a, it's, it's a cushy life.

Speaker 1:          02:03:49       It's probably a little safer. It's insulated. And that's what I've always respected about you is you, when you started bowhunting and, and you know, it's because I know firsthand how difficult it is. So you've been successful in so many different arenas, right? And been, you're Joe Rogan, all of a sudden Joe Rogan is a new bow hunter who doesn't know shit about anything and it's like, for you to say I'm okay with that. That's a big deal. Most people who have been so successful don't want to be starting out on ground zero again. So I mean, for you to do that and then and then becomes. So just disciplined and enamored with the discipline of bowhunting has been awesome. And uh, I love it. I love doing things I suck at. Most people don't. That's why I like yoga and I mean it's why, uh, like when we were working out today, you have that same sort of approach to like we were showing you all these crazy new exercises and you were gravitating towards the ones that you weren't good at.

Speaker 1:          02:04:50       I mean, it was. Yeah, I mean, I, I love pushing myself. It's like when I, when I work out with New People, I love exposing them to. I said, okay, this workout doesn't start until you're miserable. And then once you're miserable, then it counts because everybody can do it when it's easy. Right? Okay. Now you can't do it. Now we start and it's just like I, you know, I had a good eye. I just like exposing. People would always say, you know, and people, other people have said it too. I didn't invent this, but being comfortable from being uncomfortable and that's this getting that moment where, okay, now I'm here, now I want to start gaining, you know? And that's, that's just the, that's the journey that anything, this has a big reward is going to require that. Well, that's the essence of Jujitsu. Jujitsu is being comfortable while you're uncomfortable because everybody gets tapped.

Speaker 1:          02:05:43       There is no way to get good at Jujitsu unless you get mauled by another person is the only way. And you know, for me, I started Jujitsu as you know, a, a former taekwondo champion who would spend my whole lot. I was successful. It's striking my whole life. I had done, you know, different forms of striking competitions and then all of a sudden I'm doing Jujitsu and getting fucking crushed by people were my size or smaller and they're just beating the piss out of me. Like I'm a ragdoll. I'm a, I'm a grappling dummy and for me I had realized I had, first of all, I had to address the fact that I was nowhere near as competent in self defense is. I thought I was like, as soon as these guys got ahold of me, they were just strangling me. I was like, okay, like my perception of what I could do versus the reality of what I could do was I had to, I had to just address it, I had to figure it out and so okay, now I've got to get fucking crazy and attached to this shit.

Speaker 1:          02:06:37       And then I became completely obsessed with that about of training and getting. But that's one of the beautiful things about Jujitsu. One of the things about Jujitsu that I admire most in the truly good practitioners is they have very healthy egos because their, their, their egos get tested. Yeah. They're in check all the time. Constantly tapping tap all the time. Yeah. I mean, I don't think I've ever gone more than a few months in my whole life without tapping. Well, and that's the same with bowhunting. Don't start bowhunting unless you can deal with failure. You know, it's a humbling. Just like, just like you know, the discipline you're talking about. Bowhunting is a discipline. Just like that. It will humble you no matter how good you think you will. I think all very difficult things are good for you. Wait, as long as it doesn't kill you, it's good for you. I mean like these goddamn ultra marathons, you're running this crazy fuck you want 100 miles is not enough. You're like, well, I've already done that a couple of times. Now I got to do 200. So

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       here's the big foot, 200. His quick facts. Jamie just pulled up just under 50,000 feet of a sent 15,240 meters of a cent. More than 96,000 feet of elevation change. Two hundred and three point eight miles nonstop. Point to point six. Sleep stations with full aid, hot food, medical and crew access. 16 full aid stations. The race starts at Mount St Helens in the cascade mountain range of Washington state and finishes in Randall Washington. Traversing point to point the cascade mountains. That's insane.

Speaker 2:          02:08:11       That's a. So my goal with it and I've never done a 200, obviously the furthest I've run is 106 and a half miles in 24 hours. So this will be a new test. Um, and my goal for this ad, and I don't even know if it's possible. I don't want to sleep, I don't take advantage of any of those sleep stages. I want to be able to push through and finish in 60 hours and last year, 64 hours one it. And I'm trying to, that's what I'm training you want to beat that I want to beat that. I want, I want to beat six 64 and I just want to, I want to grind it out. I want to be better than I've ever been. And so that's, you know, right now I'm training. I haven't been training this hard this early in the year so I'm taking it.

Speaker 2:          02:08:52       I'm doing a lot of miles but not hammering hard and a bill trying to build up that base. So come August, I hope to line up there for the big foot 200. And I hope to run it faster than it's ever been run. Jesus Christ. Are you going to lose body mass before you do that? Because you're always lifting weights. Like what? What are you going to do differently? I need to get lighter. A way about what [inaudible] 77. Yeah. Right now I am, you know, and I was up one 82 or 83 and so I'm trying to, I want to get down. I'd like to get 69 maybe, you know, and I think I just really feel like I'd be efficient at that and I just, you know, it's, it's, it's physical, but it's a lot mental also. So I mean I'll get my, I'll prepare my body for it, but it's just whether I can hydrate and fuel, uh, well enough, smart enough and just do everything.

Speaker 2:          02:09:45       Keep my feet healthy. That's what's going to determine whether I can finish the 60 hours. So, uh, I think I, I believe I have what it takes. Um, but a lot of people probably have what it takes, but to implement it is going to be difficult. But, um, I can't wait. I wish it was tomorrow. What's the percentage of people who start that thing versus completed? I don't know. I think it's pretty high percentage because if you line up for 200, you didn't just decide to do that. Right? You know what I mean? These people are crazy. They've put in a lot of training and so if, if they're crazy enough, I mean it's a thousand dollars to run it. So if they're crazy enough to pay the entry fee lineup there, they didn't just, it wasn't on a whim. It was, they've geared their life, tore it. It's crazy too. It's not a thousand mile.

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       I mean, it's not 200 miles on a flat track. Now it's mountains, mountains. I mean, you know, that 50,000 feet of ascent, that's what does that to Mount Everest. Jesus Christ is Mount Everest. Thirty thousand feet. I think it's 26. She something like that. So it's two of those, but it has that same, uh, so it's 96,000 feet or changed. So what that means is you're grinding up as much as you're hammering down and that down. Break your quads down. As you know. It's a hard low yourself down. This is a video of it. Yeah. So that's, that's a country that it's in. What is this guy doing? He's walking. Run Bitch while you're walking. Well there's like God, this is the country. Yeah, this is it. You can't run this. Wait a minute, hold on a second. Yeah, it's like this. Yes. Oh fuck. Artist ultra in the USA, right?

Speaker 4:          02:11:24       Do you know which way to go? How do you go left or right? There'll be ribbons. So there's probably ribbons that'll mark, but this isn't. Now you're not on a bike trail. This is the hardest ultra and the USA. We need to document this. We need. This is 200 miles of this and if you try to run, here's what I learned with ultra is if you try to run where it's super steep, all you're doing is gonna blow your legs out. I mean, so you have to get good hiking tooth because you hiked the super steep stuff or this isn't even runnable really, but you don't want even want to try. So it's all about being efficient in managing, managing your resource, but it's, it's a test that's a, to put it mildly. Yeah. So I mean that. I don't know, this is what I live for, but listen dude, there's a problem and that is that this is in August and you need to be healthy and September because we got to go back. We're bowhunting temper. It's all mental. Mental Madison is definitely some physical involved in that. Yeah. People have completed it. I Dunno what, what does that one nutty run that you told me about that very few people know about the Barclays. Have you heard about this? Yeah, that's intense. What is that? That's like A. I don't even know if there's really a course. You know, they have

Speaker 5:          02:12:36       snow course. It's a, it's really loose. They don't, it's not marked. You can get lost. You have to have your own map.

Speaker 4:          02:12:41       Oh Great. Yeah. It's. And it's something like 64 miles maybe, but it's like, I mean, you're in swamps it, it's nasty. I mean I think God, it seems like for people finish or something, they only allow in. It's a small number. Twelve 20. I don't know that much about. I've heard about it just yet.

Speaker 5:          02:13:00       Two people finish it each time. Some people don't finish it. Okay. Five. You do it like I, if I remember correctly, it's like one one way up during the day and you come back down at during the night and then you switch and go the opposite way the next day up and down. And then if you can make it to that fifth turn, it's all. And it's also the same kind of way. It's nonstop. If you want to sleep, you sleep. You only have I think a window of like 36 hours total to finish the whole thing if you can make it.

Speaker 4:          02:13:25       Yeah. I mean if you don't, maybe 48 hours. But yeah, it's. You got your eye on that fucking thing. I don't know. I mean that to me the navigation is a whole different animal. You know, I want to be able to. I want to be prepared. I want to know where the course is roughly. You know what I mean? I don't really want to waste time having to read a map and a compass. That's a whole different challenge, which maybe I'll get to that at some point. Right now I just want to run 200 miles. I want to run it that race as fast as it has been run. I don't know if that. I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't know what my body's going to do, but I want to find out and I'm looking forward to it. Wow. That's intense, man.

Speaker 4:          02:14:03       I'll be ready by tomorrow. We should document it. I should be looking at a range rover next to, you know, that's conditioned. Sipping lemonade. Yeah. Control a drone. A drone. So yeah. No, I'm pretty. Yeah, it's neat. How does someone document that you would have to have gopros on or something like that because someone has to go with you that people have talked about filming it. Maybe under armour will. I'm not sure how they're going to do that. I don't know. You'd have to have some fucking savage that's willing to run it with you. My brother, I know my brother's going to run some of it with me. And he's a beast. Yeah. Yeah. So He's a, he runs, he's done 100 before run in your family. Yeah. So He's, he's tough. Dad was like a. What was your dad wouldn't track and field athlete as well?

Speaker 4:          02:14:45       Yeah, he was, you know, my, my dad was a, I'm not athletic. My Dad was a freak and uh, he had full scholarships at Oregon, Oregon State for track and field and gymnastics to different sports. He's pretty tall for a gymnast. He was around six foot tall, but just crazy ability. Um, he was an amazing athlete so I didn't get that, but maybe I got, I got enough of it to be tough to see. When people say that like, well, what have you attempted to do that's athletic wear? You failed that. Like people that say, Oh, I'm not a really good athlete. Like what does a really good athlete and someone who practices the techniques of whatever sport they're trying to do and gets really good at it. Yeah, I mean, you're really good at running and you're really good at bowhunting. Bonnie is absolutely athletic, right?

Speaker 4:          02:15:34       It's like if, if golf is a fucking sport, what's Boeing is a problem with calling hunting a sport. A lot of people out because I think it's best described as a discipline because I don't, I don't like to think of it as something that you score points. I mean, either I don't. It's too trivial. No, it's too much of life. But I do think, uh, there is athleticism within bowhunting hundred percent, especially out west, especially in the mountains in Alaska. Um, so yeah, I mean, I, I, I, when I think when people think athlete, they think to General the sports track and field football, basketball, you know, things like that. So, I mean, um, I didn't get that elite athleticism in those sports as my dad did. I mean, I think he had the ability to make the Olympics. Um, but, you know, life happened. I was born this or that, so he was. He was a freak and in what, what you might. Normal athletic

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       events, maybe bowhunting, you know, qualifies on. It's 100 percent qualifies. Look at this fighting qualifiers, athletics. I think it does, but it's way more intense than regular athletics. It's something way more personal and dangerous about the goal of knocking someone unconscious while they're trying to knock you unconscious and if, if fighting, if that counts. That's athletics. Bowhunting is most certainly athletics, but I think we both agree that it's. It's a little bit more intense than a sport. Yeah, definitely. It's more, it's almost disrespectful in a way. Not. I mean, if you consider it a sport, you call it a sport, that's fine, but in my view, it's so much about the life and the reverence for this animal that you hunt an intake. It's not. It's not. We won the superbowl, we scored the goal. The ball went in. The hole is the journey is the journey is not just a punch tags.

Speaker 1:          02:17:23       So the Punch tag, you'd say, well I won. Yeah, I won. So in a sport there's a winner and the loser, you kill the animal, you punch your, tag, you one. That's not it. I mean it's, it's the whole journey that lease it. And then also we talk about the getting the meat home and providing for your family, how do you score that you can. So yeah, it's not a sport in that regard for sure. There's, it's a discipline and even that word is like, it's Bonnie is bowhunting man. That's what it is. Yeah, it's on the song. It's not a tone. It's got its own thing. And on that note, you got to catch a flight. My brother. I do. Thank you again. So much fun to hang out even just for a few hours. It was great to hang out with you in salt lake and wander around all those freaks and dead animals. Uh, all right folks, we'll be back tomorrow with my brother Doug Derryn, Wednesday boss Rutan and Mall Rinella. Ooh, that's going to be fun. The original team from one of the original teams from pride broadcasting, two great guys. Morrows an awesome dude. Um, and bosses the best and of course on Friday, robin black, who now works for the UFC, we've got him a job. Yes. So, uh, we'll see you soon. Thank you everybody much. Love. Bye. Bye.
