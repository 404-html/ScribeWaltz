Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Three, two, one. Hello Mike. Hey. Hello. Pat. Pat. Pat, Pat, Pat, pat. Tell us Panatella. So one, one word, one word, Roseanne, or like Godzilla. Okay, cool. All right dude. Well nice to meet you guys. I've met you before, but nice to meet you. Um, for people who don't know, let's just give them right off the bat. Your story would happen to you. How you got in trouble in Canada for a joke. Real trouble. Real trouble. I got, I'm find $42,000 a Canadian or American Canadian, uh, which was, uh, like now close to 42,000 American reference. It was, um, yeah, let's say like 38,000 American. And uh, there's a thing in Canada called the human rights commission that every province has one of those. I had a joke about, I'm a little boy that was famous. He was a singer. He was a disabled boy.

Speaker 1:          00:01:00       And the, the joke, it wasn't even that mean it was just a little kid that was disabled and he was uh, he was Kinda like a make a wish foundation type kid. And he was famous in Canada. He was famous in French Canada. He had sang for the pope and the joke was like, I was super happy for him at first it's a little deaf boy. He's dying. He, his dream was to sync for the pope and then he became like a, like front page news on a, you know, everywhere in Montreal. And then he, he got a record deal and then he sang for the Canadians. Then he came out with a book and then at the end I was like, why isn't he dead yet? Like, wasn't he supposed to die? That's just the basic stuff. Like he's a little dark joke. Yeah. Like, it's what I do is dark humor.

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       Like I'm not, I'm not Ray Romano. Right. So I did that joke and uh, in never did that joke on TV. Did that joke in a special. The Dea didn't air on TV. I cut a couple of things out for TV. But uh, I, I get a letter from the human rights people saying you owe 80. First it was they wanted 82,000 for the joke. They were like, we listened to the joke. We think that this boy's family deserves 82,000 [inaudible] of this joke. What a weird number. And I thought I thought they were like this how fucking stupid I am. When I got the letter and I saw human rights commission, I thought I was getting an award or a prize or something because I, I do, I do a lot of benefits and stuff. But for, I raised money for disabled people. So I was like, fuck, it's a bad time. They recognize me as a good dude. So I read this and then I called my manager and I'm like, fuck, they want 80,000. And we were like, okay, let's just get the best lawyer we can. So I found the best lawyer in Canada, uh, that does a free speech stuff. Met Him and he told me the reason why it was $80,000, $80,000 is a weird number. Like if they ask a 2 million, you're going to fight it, but 80,000

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       is big enough to kind of scare you but not enough to really scare you. You'll go like, look, okay, can I give you a 40 and then they'll go, okay, give me a few questions. So this bit you said you cut it from the special. Right. So how do they know about it? Uh, it was, um, I did this interview on TV and the um, the reporter talked about the bit he had never seen the bit. Oh, so how did he know about someone told them about the bed, but the bed was in the special, the specialist. So it was on the Internet. So you could watch it. Yeah, you could watch it on the Internet and this special had been in movie theaters in Canada. It's just when we sold it on TV, this in French was in French. That's what I was weird.

Speaker 2:          00:03:39       Whenever people were talking about the bit they were like, it was, especially in Canada and in England where it's very left leaning. People were talking shit about the bit and I was like, you, you can't even understand that joke. That's in a language. You don't speak about a person you don't know. So the people almost made it look like I just picked this random disabled boy and I was making fun of his disability, but I was making fun of the fact that he had become famous because everyone thought he was dying and then he didn't die, which is a, you know, for him it's a dark joke. It's all. It is. Not even that particularly mean. No, it's a question really. You're not saying, hey, why don't you die? I spent money. You little fuck yeah. And say that. No. You said how come he's alive?

Speaker 2:          00:04:25       Yeah, exactly. And when I did the thing for TV, I cut a couple things out that I thought could get me in trouble because I figured, you know, when you put out a special and people pay for the special, you should be allowed. And I still think this and this. I think everyone should think this way if it like if you put out a special, you should be allowed to say whatever the fuck you want to say. But if you sell your special to like CBS or ABC, then of course they're going to cut shit out of course. But like your, your last special on Netflix. It'd be crazy if netflix had looked joe, we fucking loved your special but this, you got to cut this out. You've got to cut this into netflix credit. That's one of the reasons why they're so amazing. They, they don't give you hardly any input at all.

Speaker 2:          00:05:07       Those there go, hey, we really liked it. It's like they don't do anything. Yeah, they uh, you know, I had some controversial shit and this one in my last one, they just let it go. That's much appreciated. Yeah. I was really happy when I saw your last special. I thought it was the perfect thing to, to come back from a Nanette, like the, the gatsby special. It's an important special, but it's not funny and it's like, it's almost, you know what it is, it's her art, right? The problem is we're putting it in this box, right? You're saying that standup comedy. But if you do something and it has some laughs in it and then it goes on this, this by this journey, biographical journey of your life and your ubs observations and you, you say it in a way that's meaningful and people still enjoy it, but it's not funny anymore. It's still I, a lot

Speaker 3:          00:05:57       of comics didn't like it. A lot of columns got upset and I was like, okay, I get, I get why you would say it's not comedy, but I don't get why you would get upset. Because obviously people like it. Like I don't get upset if people like certain books or certain songs that like the. I have a good friend who likes fish, you know? I mean I don't hate fish, but it's not my cup of tea. Right. It's not a bad. That makes me upset that your friend, your friend likes fit. He said Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie and I have nothing against fish. I just, maybe I need to listen to it. Hi. Maybe I need. Jamie says no js. It's not jamie like that. That Hannah gatsby special. Like I really wanted to watch it because I didn't want to be some guy that listened to three minutes said, fuck you.

Speaker 3:          00:06:45       So I did listen to it and I do get why it. It's in, it's an important special and I think it's good for what it is, but I, I didn't like the fact that people were saying this is comedy in time. Came out with the list, the most hilarious specials and that was number one at a time when it's like a diversity Olympia toward told thing is it's all very diverse. There's some funny people on it, no doubt, but you can still like these lists. First of all, these lists are always weird because especially when it's someone's subjective opinion and there's nothing wrong with that, but it like, who the fuck are you? Like, who's this? Who's this person? I would like to see Chris Rock's list of top 10 comedians or top 10 comedy specials or someone like that. Someone who's who I know who they are.

Speaker 3:          00:07:30       I understand their thought process. Maybe this person is a famous writer. I don't know that. I don't know if they're famous journalist. I like to see like Matt Tie ebs, like top 10 movies, but it's like a certain tea gets to these top 10 things and you're like, who sits here? This is all so subjective. It's so weird. And the like, the Nanette thing is, um, I need to watch it. I've only watched parts of it, um, but that my reaction to it was my reaction to everybody else's reaction. So I'm like, what is going on here? Either it's the most amazing thing ever or some sort of an affront to comedy, you know? And either it gets a bit of both because I think it is like, it's, it's like a lot of people were saying it's like a Ted talk and I think it kind of is.

Speaker 3:          00:08:15       It's a funny Ted talk. Nothing wrong with that, right? There's nothing. I mean this is my point on all this. It's like why do we need these sort of parameters that comedy has to stay in before we accept it because it doesn't have to be your kind of shit for it to be something that people enjoy. Obviously someone enjoys it. There's a lot of people enjoying it because it's not. There's some of those. When they make those lists, were you like, let's include this person, let's include that. We've got to make sure we have x amount of women and x amount. You could see there's almost like there's a thought process behind creating these lists, but some of those people will appear on those lists over and over and over again. So that means to me, for sure. Somebody loves that special that's special is like number one on so many people's lists, not just number two or number three.

Speaker 3:          00:09:03       It's number one. A lot of people's lists, so someone's enjoying it. So like, what do I give a shit? What does anybody give a shit? Was my reaction is my reaction to these comics that are like upset? I'm like, but why? But why are I remember why I remember why they got mad. It wasn't because they were saying it's the number one special is because she went on an interview I think in Australia and said, if you're a comedian who only cares about making people laugh, then you should stop doing comedy. You shouldn't be in show business, they shouldn't see you publicly, you should give a message. Right. But I disagree with that strongly, but from her perspective, what she's trying to do, it's like someone who's really into rock and roll that like, fuck rap, music, rock and roll, you know, that's what they're saying.

Speaker 3:          00:09:45       I mean, that's what she's saying. She's doing it in like a comedic form. She's like, if you're only in a comedy that makes people laugh, fuck you. Kinda. Yeah, you're, I'm in the deep comedy bitch. I mean, there's nothing wrong with one of my favorite all time standards for sure is Mitch Hedberg and Mitch Hedberg had all nonsequitors. Nothing was. There's no deep meaning to any of it all. It was like super silly and still to this day like, especially if I'm in traffic, I'll listen to that shit because it's just so silly, you know? He's fucking. It was amazing, but it's just that his, his expression and everybody's expression is going to be different and this is something I've figured out over the course of my. I mean, I didn't get it right all the time when I was young. I was like, you know, I, I hated people that didn't swear and I was like, there's no way you talk like that for real.

Speaker 3:          00:10:34       There's no way you talk like that for real. But then after awhile I was like, why do I care? Do some of the best ever. Don't swear like Jerry Seinfeld. He doesn't swear. So one of the best comedians of all time is, it's not even a subjective question or an opinion like you, you, everybody knows he's one of the best. However, if you have 100 comedians that, to the best ever, Jerry Seinfeld's none the, your that lists bullshit. Brian Regan hilarious. Doesn't swear it off. You know, like there's a lot of great comics who just have their thing. Like there's, there's comics that have puppets that are really funny. Like you just because you have a puppet, it doesn't mean you're not really funny. But for a lot of comics, for Qms, go to papa. Yeah, it's weird. I'm not there yet. I just felt like everything else I was on Bart.

Speaker 3:          00:11:19       I was like, do you ever say auto and George? Yeah, George. But, but that was almost making fun of the whole thing, but the end that I fucking love that people would get mad at him because his lips moved to fucking move bro. He wasn't even trying to hide it. It was just funny. You know, there was a, there's been a few really fun a puppet acts, you know? Um, I mean, who gives a shit? Do whatever the fuck you like, you know, I think that's a thing though when you're in your twenties that anything that isn't what you do are you like, is garbage, right? Yeah. Because I remember I was like that too, like a plus. Like that was I think a, uh, thing about being in your twenties in the nineties because we had just had, you know, Kennison and, and you know, uh, like Bill Hicks and so, so if, if you were doing like a, like, like Jeff Foxworthy were, we were judging you but we shouldn't like, yeah, who gives a shit?

Speaker 3:          00:12:17       Yeah. Jeff foxworthy parameters. Like the nicest guy in the history of the world. Yeah. He looks nice. I'd never met him. Larry the cable guy's nice as fuck. He's super sweet and he got super judged too hard. People went hard on him. Dave crossroad a crazy letter to him. Like a letter from Dave, the desk of days cross. It was free. It was like tongue in cheek, but it's. The idea was that he was somehow or another promoting racism. I think that was what people said. He's doing a character. His real name's Dan Whitney. His character is really dumb guy who doesn't have sleeves, who's fucking hilarious and it's good character. His character isn't racist, the racist, but you know, there's like these lands I looked, there's once you run out of like really high profile targets that are actually racist, then you have to like find things are close to that.

Speaker 3:          00:13:05       I don't know what you're saying. I don't like what you're saying there. What are you saying about Asian people? Like don't do it, don't you fucking. I mean there's some, there's some things you could still get, like there's some like absolute realities that you, you can say, right? Like you could say, Asian people in generally have higher iqs and they're better at math as a fact, Joe. That's a solid fact, you know, but if it goes the other way, if it's positive, right, you can always do it. The thing about white people is we're not as smart as Asians. See, I could say that because I'm white, but if I was Asian and I was like, white people are just not as smart. Even though it's true like terms of Iq tests and mathematics in particular, they're just fucking smarter. There's so, so much smarter.

Speaker 3:          00:13:47       You know what they're doing in Harvard. Yeah. See this shit. They're. They're making it more difficult for Asian students to get into Harvard. There's a class action lawsuit because they've actually raised the score levels that Asians have to achieve because there's so many of them. Fast, racist, and that's actual racism. Phrase this super racist, fucking racist, but you don't hear leftwing people, progressive people calling out that kind of racism because because of the way many Asian cultures have sort of structured their society, people don't complain as much and they work hard and they like fucking put their nose to the grindstone and they get going and this is part of their culture and so when something like this happens there, they have to break out of those norms in order to protest is really obvious racism and because they really haven't done that before, they just sort of silently working hard.

Speaker 3:          00:14:41       Harvard just decided, no, it's too many of you. You fucking smarty pants, Asian folk. So. Well a few people have. Jordan Peterson has. Sam Harris has, you know, there's a few recognized public minds. I would, you know the word intellectual, such a weird word, right? Public intellectuals, but those guys are definitely public intellectuals where they have these long form discussions. I don't remember watching on the Internet. They're doing these debates together. Fascinating man. It's really fascinating. Especially they're just there discussions about religion because Jordan is fairly religious, but the. He's got a really interesting way of putting it. He says he, he acts as if God is real, not that he believes in God, but that he acts as if God is real and he finds great benefit to that, which is very arguable. Right. And that Harris is like not buying it at all and he's brilliant too.

Speaker 3:          00:15:32       So the two of them together, it's like, wow, this is, this is a fascinating. It's like really cool high level conversation and you get to sit in on. The thing I like about Darren Peterson, I've noticed whenever I watch his interviews, he, he thinks like sometimes like if someone asks them a question, you'll see them stop and think to really see where he's gone. Whereas like a dumb guy like me, I just started talking and I'm like, ah, I'll eventually out. He knows exactly what he's saying, you know, especially in regards to like Marxist history and things that he gets very upset about. You know, he gets, he's, he's, he's having these conversations like literally on a daily basis. So was going over a lot of these grievances and a lot of the material he talks about, he's going over to a lot. So he's got that shit bolted down and he got in trouble too with the human rights commission in Ontario.

Speaker 3:          00:16:23       Yeah. He got in trouble because they were going to force people to use compelled pronouns and there were some weird language that he didn't like about the way they could enforce it or what they were asking people to do. And then it got to the point where we're saying, well, we're talking about made up words now. Like it gets to a certain point where people get, look, people are fucking self-indulgent. We all know it. We all know it. And, and, but there's also the other side of it says, well, people also should be able to express themselves as freely as you guys get to do on stage. Why can't they do that with their name or their gender or you know, whatever the fuck they want. And why do you care if it's so simple to just say whatever the fuck they want you to say, you know, it's just a name, right?

Speaker 3:          00:17:04       Xer or all those. But Jordan was like there 78 different ones. Now we can't do this like this is, this is chaos. And I like, I'm very pro trans, like you can do whatever the fuck you want to do, but it's the same as like onstage, I can do whatever the fuck I want to do on state, but that doesn't mean you have to come see me. And it's the same thing if you want to be called Zur, I don't even know what the fuck that is. So I'm accidentally going to call you her or him. Yeah, that can definitely happen. And you can't get upset at that. No one knows what the fuck is. And plus like if you get it wrong, it's an accident, right? There's a difference between you being on stage because it was like a choice with your life, right? You decided to be a comedian

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       is an argument there. Right. And then the other side is, well they didn't have a choice. They, they, they feel compelled, like they actually are of the other gender and they, they, their brain is wired like the other gender and their body just isn't what they're supposed to have and it's fucking with their head. Got It. Okay. I'm cool with that too. You know, like I don't. It's fine. As long as you're not interfering with other people's lives because of your choices. Like if you're not, you're not fucking with me. I don't have to do anything. I just have to call you. She now okay. Yeah, as long as I know. Yeah, I'm uncomfortable. I don't. Why would you bully someone on purpose? You know it's going to fuck with them. His problem was that he didn't want it to be compelled because they need to get in trouble if you fuck up.

Speaker 4:          00:18:31       Exactly. Exactly. And this is, this is what he's talking about. He has no problem calling a male who transitioned to female girl or she or her, but he's like, you can't use these. You can't compel me to use these made up words. Because at a certain point when these things get rolling, they become contests and they become this battle. It's an idea battle. Which side are you on? And they try to win. It's one of the problems that I have with police officers and even the court system that what happens when you get a prosecutor and a defense attorney is there's a contest going on and these guys, they are involved in this contest multiple times a week with a bunch of different cases and they're moving things around all the time, but they're constantly trying to win. This is what they're trying to do. When a cop pulls you over and he, he gets you for something, he's trying to arrest you.

Speaker 4:          00:19:23       He's trying to win. Like we were playing a game. Now you know this is, he's allowed to play this game and this is what he's supposed to do and you know, he's got every right to do it. So he's going to search your home and it'll shoot your dog because you have weed. And this is where all this stuff comes from. It comes to these, this insane justification for these ridiculous axe comes from the fact that you've been given a set of rules in order to participate in this game, but the game when it comes to like things like compelled pronouns and when it becomes too like pushing the envelope further and further and further at a certain point in time, you can't say no you, you can't make up a new language. Okay? Agreed. Okay. You can't make a new bill lang. You know, I can't.

Speaker 4:          00:19:59       I don't have to learn, you know, fucking Mikey language and PD language and Tommy Lee. So let's just agree on the words we use. How many different new words do you have? Boiling down to one, get back to me if you want to call it a trans person or a queer person, you want to call Missouri as everybody agreeZ, , h e r, Z, h e r, that's a new thing. I don't give a fuck, but don't say I got to go to. I'll go to jail or you can bring me in front of a trial or some tribunals, some fucking tribal council. What are you going to do? You're gonna Bang drums and decide if I've uttered the wrong phrase, but who are these guys to judge also, because Mike didn't tell you, but one of the judges on that tribunal who was saying, Oh, you're a piece of shit for making fun of a kid after that was found to have kiddie porn. He was some kind of child molester and he was judging that he was too shitty to a kid. There were two people at the Human Rights Commission

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       in Quebec. The we're. One of them was the president that had to resign, that he had paid off a 13 year old girl like 15 years ago to not tell anyone that he had had sex with her and then another one, I think he had had sex with a. It was a six year old, like it was fucking crazy, but these motherfuckers. That's what I hated. These. These people were telling me, okay, you're. You did a joke onstage and that's all your intent. That's what people forget. Oftentimes in my intent wasn't to hurt this little kid. My intent was to make people laugh, but these guys, their intent was to put their dick inside of a child that's fucking. And they judged him and they judged me fucking crazy. While hypocrisy knows no bounds and I think, you know, anybody that's doing anything like that, it's just a sickness that in comprehensible these fucking guys, man.

Speaker 1:          00:21:43       So they put you through some shit. Like you went through this for a long time. Like my, my lawyer when I first met my lawyer, I told him, he was like, look, they want you to settle. And he goes, I could, I could, um, get it reduced, get it reduced. So like 20 grand. And I was, I told them, I said, if I do that, I'm fucking everyone, like any comic in Canada is going to be fucked because I'm going to set this weird precedent. So I told him, I was like, I'd rather give you 100,000 then give them five. So then he. But he told me, he was like, we can't win the cause I didn't go to court. I went to the human rights tribunal. I was judged by the human rights tribunal and the Human Rights Commission was bringing me there, so it's me versus them judged by them.

Speaker 1:          00:22:28       So he told me you're definitely going to lose to kangaroo court, but he said, he said, uh, then will appeal and the government will probably accept the, to, to listen to the case again. And then he goes, then you'll win that. And, but so I said, yes. I was like, look, I have to do this. And I'm out. I, I, I loved rocky and there was something weird about. I was like, this is fucking rocky. I'm going to be, I'm going to lose the champ. So, so then like I was, something really weird happened to me though is I didn't, I didn't think it did affect me this much because when I was in court and I saw this kid's family fucking crying and I was like, holy fuck, okay. These people really took this shit seriously. And I felt it. It was weird because my, my joke, my intent was to make people laugh.

Speaker 1:          00:23:19       And this kid, I've fucking nothing against this kid. Like I don't, I don't, I don't not like them, I don't know. But then to see that they took this seriously and then the, how the media was portraying me, like uh, the in, I did a series of shows in Edinburgh and there's a newspaper, Montreal, the wrote a Mike Ward, Mike Ward is getting rich off of this little boy and I was doing shows in Edinburgh that no one makes money. They're like, I was playing like a 200 seat theater. And I was like, oh, these fuckers are making me look like I'm becoming rich because of this little kid. You became a target. And then quick bait. That's how they get people to pay attention. And I didn't think it did affect me. But the thing that I think the reason why it did affect, affect me is if all you get is hate, you can block hate out. It's super easy to block Keto and, and if all you get is love, that's easy too. But I was getting hate and love so, so I'd be like, you know, I wouldn't let the Hayden. But then someone had shown me love so I'd open up and then the hated come in and it was just so fucking weird and I was like googling myself too much. I'd be like, I'd be like, Oh fuck, okay. There's an article about me in, in Russia, and then I google translate to see that I'm a piece of garbage.

Speaker 1:          00:24:37       It was weird and then I just saw I shows weren't fun anymore. So I was doing shows and it people were like, I'd get these weird hecklers. And I was like, I don't, I, I didn't like comedy anymore and this is the only thing I've ever done my whole life. This is the only thing I've ever loved. Like I don't have kids because of comedy, because I was like, I know I'm not the type of person. Like, like you're good at organizing your life. If I had kids, I like the way I live my life, I'd be a horrible father. So I never had kids because of that. And then I was like, fuck, the only thing I liked I don't like anymore. And now I don't have kids, which is weird. But that, yeah, so I went through this to get out of the funk, uh, took about a year and a half.

Speaker 1:          00:25:24       Wow. And I told like, um, I didn't have, like I make a good living but I'm a Canadian comics so I make Canadian comic money like, so. So I had money, I had money to pay, like it's cost me 150 so far in lawyer fees. I, so far it's ongoing. It's ongoing because now the appeal is, the appeal is going to be cheap though. It's going to be like only a couple thousand but, and I have that. I had um, I had to Bruce Hills from just for laughs that organize the benefit for me. Bruce is the best fucking person on the world. He, he raised about 20. I had a, a, a go fund me the raise 30. So I paid 100 grand and then I had 50, I had people helping me and that pretty much got rid of all my savings. So I told my manager I didn't like doing shows anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:26:10       So it was like book me the minimum amount of shows that I can, you know, I can pay my bills because my, like, I've, you know, my wife doesn't work. So I was, he booked me like a week of shows and so three weeks out of the month I was going through this weird depression one week of the month I was doing shows, pretending like everything was okay. And that took like maybe a year, a year and a half of me going through this really, really weird, weird funk. But the thing that was good, I um, I don't meditate but I spend my days in the bath, like I just be like lying down in the bath, just staring at the ceiling, drinking wine. Like I was drinking wine in my bathtub all day, like at least four hours a day. Wow. And then, um, and I could feel like, like what, you never know when you're in a weird funk where the bottom's going to be.

Speaker 1:          00:27:01       But once you start going back up then you know, okay, I'm getting out of this. And then when I started feeling better, like I was like, okay, I'm feeling better, a little better, a little better. And then I'm like six. I've been out of it like six months ago. I called my manager six months ago and I was like, okay, I'm back a book, this, this, this, I gotta get, I gotta get some money again. Well here's the news cycle. And Canada gone away from it. Yeah, definitely helps too. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Like people will find new things. Yeah. This is a thing like people, whenever people go after you, you, it affects you. And you remember. And then two weeks later people don't even remember. Even people that I had this woman that she had written me on my facebook, like this 60 year old woman that her facebook profile is her with a cat and you know, again, no clouds and a sweet old lady.

Speaker 1:          00:27:53       And she'd written a, I'm happy your mom died because if she was still alive, she, uh, she'd kill herself. Seeing what her son has become. And I was like, Oh, you fuck a bitch? But I started like, I, I see. I go to her page, uh, I kept on going or a page now and uh, like I'm a better month ago I did an interview and she shared it and she was like, oh, like, like I was a good person again. I was like this frizzy, crazy bitch. Yeah. Has probably a medication. Do you remember saying that to you? And what's even crazier is I keep going back to her page. That's crazy. You're crazy. It's fucked up. Yeah. She's on the fucking Roseanne type. Adderall. She's probably whacked out of her hand or something, you know, who knows what she's on. And alcohol really helped.

Speaker 1:          00:28:36       Like, I know it's not good, but alcohol really helped. And um, so you recommend it, recommend it if you're. Because it's a depressant, but it, it's a number. It's better to be sad and drunk than just said. Interesting. Yeah. And, but I knew like, and now I still drank, but I drank my way less, way less. I was drinking, I was drinking maybe like four, four or five, maybe six, 26 ounces a week. Like I was drinking almost a full bottle of vodka every day. That would be impressive. But yesterday jake, the snake was on 80 mile drive with Andre the giant, I think 48 beers. Yeah. No, that's fucking crazy. And he didn't already eight peers. So yeah. No, no, I was not a wine though, man. Yeah. And the fact that you just sit in the tub and just in your diabetic. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:29:31       I'm diabetic. You're not supposed to be drinking wine, are you? Oh, there aren't that many carbs in wine, like not that much sugar. Not that much. But you're drinking it all day. She'll catch up now, but that's why I switched to vodka. Good mood. Don't stop thinking about my health. Getting organic. Just make sure it's organic. You'll be fun. Exactly. Yeah. So, um, do they give you a time where you have to finish this thing or where it's going to be settled by? I just got. This was many years ago, right? What year did it start this? This is a joke. I wrote in 2009 and I did in a special. That was from 2010. I did a tour 2000, 10 to 2012, so this is a super old joke and what's fucked up defending something that you wrote 10 years ago, like people were like, what were you thinking when you wrote that joke?

Speaker 1:          00:30:19       And I'm like, I don't know what the fuck. I was thinking not even year. And some one guy told me, he was like, you know, you can't say things like that anymore nowadays. And I was like, oh, I know. I wrote that joke 10 years ago. Ten years ago. We used to do say shit. That was way fucking meter than that. Yeah, there's some funny dark jokes, you know, I always bring up is Brian Holzman bit that he did right after. I remember that Susan Smith Lady that drowned her kids. Do you remember? Yeah. Crazy shit. They found this lady drove her car into the river and just drowned her kids did it on purpose and a right after it happened. Brian holds, but it goes onstage. The comedy story goes.

Speaker 4:          00:30:57       Ladies and gentlemen, I heard those are bad kids. They sat that close to the TV. They never put away their blocks, the constantly spilling the milk. Those kids will not be missed and everybody was like, Oh shit. It was so ridiculously mean and funny at the same time, and people have to understand that that's you're in a nightclub. People are drinking, you are allowed freedom of expression. It is fun. These aren't bad people. Holtz was not a bad person. You're not a bad person, bad people. These are people that are doing a certain type of art form and here's what's weird, this type of art form, when you do you say mean shit that you don't really mean for whatever reason you can't do that because you're a guy on stage and it's too much like you're actually saying it, but if you were saying it in a movie, if you're planning a fine, be fine. You're playing a mean fucking villain characters saying awful shit in a movie. Everybody would be like, yeah, Sam Jackson is a great guy. He didn't really kill that guy over the cheeseburger like that. That was just a. his character did that. He's a murderous monster, right? He's screaming Bible Vengeance, Bible verses and then fucking shooting this dude, but nobody has a problem with that because it's Samuel Jackson's obviously an actor in pulp fiction was a movie. We don't have any confusion.

Speaker 1:          00:32:09       Santa file. Yeah. Yeah. And then movie. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's something that's fucked up about Canada though. There's a makeup artist named him. He quits. He's a Sudep five times. That's like the GSP of makeup artist. But he, yeah, he's special effects makeup and he did this movie, sort of like a, just a, like a demo of what he can do. It was a short film where he had this little kid and he murdered the kid. He didn't actually murder the kid and uh, and then he put that out on the Internet with, you know, his name at the end and the whole who played who and some fucking Weirdo in Germany saw this and thought it was real cold. Interpol, Interpol called the Montreal cops. Montreal police went to remain [inaudible] house to arrest him for murder. And then he said no, but the kid, they were like, we saw the video.

Speaker 1:          00:33:02       And he goes, yeah, but the kid see the kid in the video, he's my neighbor. So they went to meet the, the murder victim, which was a little kid neighbor and they saw he was alive and they still, they took, they took them to court because they said what he did incited violence and, and he and everyone told them they were like, you're gonna win for sure because this is just stupid. But the thing is he had to defend himself. He had to go to court and he had to. And when you win a court case like that, like if it costs you 30, 50, 80,000 to defend yourself, the government doesn't give you your money back. And that's a stupid like my case, I find it, it's Kinda stupid. But his case is fucking retarded because no one ever kills someone. Films it. And then has the end credits.

Speaker 3:          00:33:49       Yeah, no. Well, if they did, now they'll do it. Because you said no one ever does that. I would like to point you to a podcast with Mike Ward. We clearly showed some fucking psycho set established. He's like, challenge accepted. This is why Jordan Peterson was so adamant that that bill was dangerous and that it would be bad for everybody in bad for free speech. When we look at it in America, I think we have a distorted perception because I don't think we totally understand your system of government when it comes to censorship because you guys don't have freedom of expression the way we do in America.

Speaker 1:          00:34:20       What's fucked up too about being Canadian is since all of our TV and all of our movies are American, like the first thing I asked my lawyer, I was like, what about? What about the First Amendment? He was like, yeah, we don't. We don't have it. I was like, no, I know we don't. I know we're not America, but we must have the Canadian version of that, and he was like, no, there's no like, like people all over the world that talk shit about the states. The states is the only place in the world that speech is protected by law. You can still get in trouble by saying shit. You can still get it.

Speaker 3:          00:34:52       Protests. Did you see Michelle Wolf Donk on the president today? No. She dunked on trump. Dude. Donald trump talk shit about her saying that she bombed so hard last year at the White House press correspondents' dinner, which unfortunately for him we've all seen the video and she didn't bother at all. In fact she killed. She had some funny shit and so he wrote today that she bumped so hard. They're now going to bring someone like they're not going to do comedy anymore. They're going to bring in an author. Here it is. Yeah. So called comedian Michelle was bombed so badly as you're in the White House correspondence dinner that this year for the first time in decades they will have an author instead of a comedian. Good first step to come back with dying evening and tradition. Exclamation point. Maybe. I will go question. She writes. I bet you'd be on my side if I had killed a journalist.

Speaker 3:          00:35:41       Hashtag best. That's good. We'll get. She's got 297,769 likes. Sixty 4,000. One hundred 69 retweets. One of which is mine. That was brutal. That shit is hilarious. She's, she's a savage and he's. That's silly. What he did was silly. You can't say someone bought, but he does. I mean that's his move, right? It doesn't have to be real, but you shouldn't say someone bombed when we can watch the fact that it didn't bomb. You pull it up at anytime you want and you could watch that video. She killed him. Say that though, because since the people that have seen it, no, she didn't bump, but the people that didn't see it, now they think, I don't think it matters. I think in the mag a mindset. Okay. If you had a mag, a mindset, it would be you don't need any reality other than the reality that you all decided upon and you press forward with fucking hashtags and American flags and red and white hats and you just keep moving.

Speaker 3:          00:36:38       You just keep moving and eventually what you're doing is you're like hacking the news cycle because the news cycle is just so everything lasts a day. Maybe two days, four days sick. No, he's a fuck about stormy daniels. Stop talking about it. It's over, like that's what's going on. I mean that's. And they've kind of figured that out and sort of an odd way like even him with the stormy Daniels. Thank you. Still talk about it. It'll go away. It's going away. Not only that, like the fucking lawyer now he got charged with domestic violence. The lawyer for stone stormy day. The guy who was going to run for president now he got charged with domestic violence and check out a restraining order. It's over baby. So like you just keep moving. All they do is just keep moving, just keep moving and eventually go like this, like yeah, obviously she didn't bomb.

Speaker 3:          00:37:23       He can say she did and even she'd done because them keep moving, just keep moving. It doesn't do nothing ever sticks because he's caught a wave. Like there's the new cycles. So crazy. Everything's so crazy. There's nothing stationary that we call can examine for long periods of time. Everything's just moving. Everything's just constantly moving. There's no stability. It's k with him in the White House. He knows there's no stability because he actually got to be the president. Yeah, he figured like he treats everyone like a comic treats hecklers. Yes. And he's said, and people that say that he still, he's, he's so smart, like he figured he figured all this shit figured out that all the protocol that was established in the fucking 18 hundreds, early $19. It doesn't mean anything anymore. You know, this is not Harry Truman. This is, this is not George Washington. This is 2018.

Speaker 3:          00:38:14       There's porn everywhere. Okay. Oxycontin's are killing people and no one's talking about it. Cigarettes are killing people. No politician ever brings up the fact half a million people die every year in this country. Just from cigarettes. Shut the fuck up, keep moving. And then, you know, he said he had that little jeff sessions, little munchkin working for him forever with saying that good people don't smoke marijuana like the whole thing. Chaos. He's knows it's chaos because he's the top guy. You imagine being the top guy in something as insane as like the United States governmental system and seeing the lobbyists and special interest groups and all the money and all the fucking cast and Saudi Arabia's cutting up journalists and you gotta keep your mouth shut. It's fucking madness. And he's the top madman. No wonder why he tweets shit like this. He knows there's no rules so crazy. It could all fall apart at any minute.

Speaker 3:          00:39:01       It's so fucking wacky. I was watching today. Him pardoning a Turkey. I don't know why you guys still do this kind of crazy shit. But he was probably tweeting about Jim Acosta being a fag and then turns around and goes, this Turkey, good Turkey. He came here illegally. Let them. It's so stupid. What did he do with that Turkey? He, um, he just, he just decided to. Turkey gets to live. Yeah. What happens to those immediately when they shut the cameras off for sure. I'm not telling you you're going to eat you for Christmas. So the whole idea that that would be a thing. It's so fucking stupid. We're going to decide one Turkey, one turkeys are good Turkey. Yeah, and everyone's like, save it. Save it. Nope. Out with the ax. Psych. I was just kidding. Put his head on a log chunk. People would freak out.

Speaker 3:          00:39:44       But you knew I was going to kill a Turkey. Why were you upset that I'm killing this Turkey? Yeah, but it's all in St Louis. Yesterday he tweeted, he said some, uh, I believe Saudi Arabia may have been behind that Kosha. Shaggy. Murdered. Like, did you just figure that out? What is he a detective? It took this long. Everybody knew. Well, okay, let's examine that. You stay. Everybody knew, right? Yeah. How much do you really know? Only what? Turkey to told us. Only what the. Everybody tells you. I'm not, I'm not saying I'm not advocating conspiracy theories, but anyone who says they know what happened. Like Jesus, the only people that know what happened or the people that did it, and then the people who think they know what happened to the people that are examining it and then the people that are reading third, fourth, fifth, sixth hand about what happened.

Speaker 3:          00:40:29       We're just talking shit, you know. Oh, they killed him. Are you sure? Okay. I'm sure this is what I'm sure. I'm sure that if you stare at the sun, it burns your eyes. Right. I tried it. I've, a lot of people have done it. I'm sure you know. I'm sure that if you a light dead trees up on fire, they, it becomes a wildfire. It's very dangerous. I'm sure of that. That's real. Who killed that guy? I'm, I'm sure someone killed them. They're all admitting they killed them. Pretty sure that pretty sure. Pretty sure. I don't really know. Right? Because one day saying that they had, the Turkish government had recordings, but they didn't want to share them publicly because they didn't want the other embassies knowing how they record embassies because you're not supposed to. Exactly. So that's what they said. If you're not supposed to, but I think they probably all do it. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Well, apparently there's video and audio is what I read, but I don't know if that's true. Fuck. Do I know when you want to say, oh, they killed them. They fucking killed him. Said that he, there is an audio tape, but he wasn't going to hear it because he didn't want to hear it. It was totally. Didn't need to. Yeah. You know what, man, that brings me back to that movie. Grizzly

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       man, remember grizzly man, they had audio. The guy got eaten by a grizzly bear, lived with Chrissy bills forever. Everybody's like is going to get eaten and then one day gets heat and along the way, have you ever seen the documentary? It's a Warner Herzog movie. It's one of the greatest unintentional comedy of all time. It's really good what? Get Lit and watch it. You're going to fucking love it. It's a guy who is. There's something wrong with him and right away like you, you start making judgments. Like, is he gang? I think he's gay. I think he's gay and he fighting it and one of the ways he fights it, he goes and lives in the forest. I'm not bullshitting. He didn't get the term bears. No, he's saving bears, but he's like so feminine and he brings his fucking camera and he's walking through the forest.

Speaker 4:          00:42:19       He goes, I wish I was just gay, but I'm not gay. If I was gay then I would just go meet a guy at a truck stop or something, but I'm not gay. So it's like who? Who are walking around by themselves in the woods surrounded by bears going, wow, files just gay or be so easy, like, do you hear how you're saying it? Like the stereotypical gay voices. One of the weirdest things because there's like not a single masculine heterosexual male who uses that speech pattern. Like that speech pattern. It's exclusive to gay men. Like I'm not gay, whatever. Here we go. I was like, this is a speech pattern that we associate with homosexuals and you know, you could say someone's prejudice, but you look, you know it's true. That's true. You know, you hear someone talking and saying homosexual type things in that voice you have. It sounds like a gay guy.

Speaker 1:          00:43:13       Have you ever had. I had a friend come out of the closet to me and the whole time he was coming out I was like, Oh shit, I'm going to have to pretend like I'm surprised because he was like, look, I got a Ta. And I was like, Oh fuck.

Speaker 4:          00:43:29       It's weird. It is weird. Yeah. Well, you know what it's weird is any discussion of it is deemed homophobic. It's not homophobic at all. No problem with me being gay, but it is weird that some percentage, whether it's 10 percent, 20 percent, whatever the number is of gay guys talk gay. They're adorable. You know, they say gay things. They have their fingers. Justin Martin deals. Good friend of mine. Gaze. Fuck loves it. Swings. He swings when he walks he sachets as he walks into a room. He's hilarious too. Fucking funny. Standup comic. But he's, he, you know, he will take on those kind of vocal affectations, you know, not negative.

Speaker 1:          00:44:11       There's a comic of Montreal. He's a good friend named John Sanka Dart. He's a gay guy, but a gay audiences don't like him because he's a guy guy. Like he's from a small town in Manitoba or whatever. So gay people don't like him cause he, cause he's, he's a guy guy and then we were talking last summer and I was like, you should do a show and

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       call it no gays allowed because whenever he has gay people it always goes wrong because they get angry and that's so weird. He's a guy guy but he's gay and they get mad. But here's what's funny, if he was a guy guy but he was straight, they'd probably want to turn him. Yeah, he should pretend to be a straight guy that's like really easy to turn. A buddy of mine who was a makeup artist, super good dude who's gay as fuck. And he was always telling me about these. He would do airtech street guys that would suck his dick straight of him suck. They're laughing. I was like, ah. He, he would give me details like what is going on? What's going on? They like it. They get a thrill out of turning guys, but I don't think they're turning anybody. I had a friend that used to, when I first moved to Montreal, we he'd be like, let's go to a gay bar because a lot of women go there because they don't want to get hit on, and then he was like, we'll just pretend like we're gay and we'll try to have sex with the lady for the first time.

Speaker 2:          00:45:31       He was really good at it because he was like super thin, so he did look like a gay guy, but I just looked like a fucking weird, weird fucking Chubby, straight guy going into a gay bar. Like fuck gay guys built like you. But I'm always surprised whenever I see chubby gay guys. I don't believe. I don't believe they're really gay because I'm like, okay, I'm a dude. I wouldn't fuck someone shaped like that. Hm. Interesting. Yeah. Maybe A. Maybe they just have different genes. I see it differently. I don't know. Something about them as attracted to someone who has got a lot of natural resources stored in the skin. You know what? If it gets really cold out, stay alive. He could keep me warm. He'll protect me. Keep fucking me.

Speaker 3:          00:46:17       Hang onto him. Oh, did you? I don't know if you're doing an archery today, but did you see that tribe this morning? I saw a video we're talking about right before the podcast, but the guy in India who's trying to convert them apparently January San and they shot him full of arrows with the one of the last uncontacted tribes in the world. But what a doofus. What'd you think was gonna Happen? Right? Jamie said the guy's been there before. Right? Did you say that? So they knew him. The other guy. Well, I don't know. The people that killed them knew them when they say there's between 50 and 100 people on this island, I believe. See if we can get a good article on it. Set the number of trying to pull up on our book. So those are like 50 or 50 to 150 people. They don't exactly know.

Speaker 3:          00:46:55       Um, and they, they came there just say from it's the size of Manhattan. So the island and they came here from Africa, like what is it? Sixty thousand years ago I'd read them. I don't remember exactly where I. The article earlier. India? Yeah. Yeah. Someone in India or near near near India. So island fucking dude was trying to bring them to Jesus and they said if you liked the guy will introduce it to them. They filled up motherfucker full. Oh Wow. It's in the middle of nowhere. All that. Fuck. That bitch is in the middle of nowhere. So they came off of Africa. That's crazy. How the fuck you see all that shit. That's crazy. Yeah. You know what's interesting too, in England they call uh, people from India, Asians, they think of that as Asia because it is. But we got weird with oriental at some point in time. Oriental became derogatory, some weird way.

Speaker 3:          00:47:54       Oriana was normal like oriental rugs. That was like a thing you'd go to oriental rugs. Yeah. That's like if someone was saying, you know, toothpaste, like, hey, hey motherfucker, you can't say that shit anymore. But at one point in time oriental was like a total. This is a real thing. Yeah. It was part of the language. Um, but so now we say Asian because we try to be politically correct, but Asia is fucking giant. There's a lot of different kinds of folks in Asia. You know, what, what, what those, like the people that ended up on that island one dude, they, how the fuck do you, you're running away from something to end up. Well everybody's, that's, you know, if you read about the migration of people from Africa spreading out, that's a big part of what they're doing is trying to get away from people that are trying to tell them, yeah, it's all either they run out of resources, they're run a food or they're being, they're being forced out of areas like new people come in, people escape and survive and did our entire history as human beings.

Speaker 3:          00:48:55       It's like bigger, more powerful human beings move into an area and kill and rape and then spread, spread out and then keep going and everybody else just keeps going and they eventually fortify in the distance. You get a new city and they try to hold them off and then new people coming through. I mean there's so many instances from the mon goals to the Romans being go back and back and matt all through history, but if you broke it down, if you looked at it like a math problem, like what's happening here, here's this happening. These groups of people get together and then they develop some shit there, kills other groups of people and they push into those groups of people and try to fuck their chicks, steal money, fuck the chicks, eat their food, and then they do the same thing and then and then people go back and forth and this is all people have done.

Speaker 3:          00:49:34       Like there's never been a time where no one was at war. Like if you've ever gone through human history, there's no like, well there was a period of a hundred years where there was no warrants. It's never happened. Never ever happened. You're the best guy to ask about. This isn't impressive how they built those arrows, right? The craftsmanship because their proper error, what they look like. They have pictures of the arrows, but apparently he died. Just have the arrows hitting them. So the way I was thinking it was in order for an Arrow to be done properly, right, and you could aim and then hit someone and killed them. It has to go through the whole structure of the pelvis. No, it doesn't have to. I mean, especially with the kid hit a bunch of times, you know, if they hit him a bunch of times, they get a shot him in the gut. Shitty arrows. Well I don't think they have shitty hours because they need them to survive. Right. So there has got to be island animals and they're hunting these animals. But it's not that hard for these people and these kinds of tribes to, if they have the proper would on the island, you know, they um,

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       they've been. People have been making bows and arrows for a long time and they, they'll use certain fibers from certain trees and they weave them together and make a bowstring and you know, if they have enough goodwood and they have good fiber and they have the knowledge. I mean, even if they don't have metal, you could still to this day I found one in Nevada. I found an old, I don't know what era it's from, but I found a an arrowhead, but while I was actually bow hunting, I found an actual arrowhead from some native American tribe that they left by and apparently they were like really common, like people find them all the time because you think of the thousands of years that the indigenous people were here and all the different animals they shot with bows and arrows. They figured out how to do it so these people must know how to do it too and if they have enough good stone to make something flint or something similar to make the arrowheads or maybe they're using something toxic, maybe they have some sort of toxic plant and they just dipping the tip of a sharpened tip into it.

Speaker 2:          00:51:29       If if you dip the tip and something toxic, don't can you eat. That means you can apparently, but not the area near the question. It's a good question. I don't know, but a lot of these tribes that shoot things that shoot things with poison on the end of their arrows. Yeah. Well, the idea is that they just didn't want to eat it, right? They don't, if they don't hit it perfectly, they're not going to wait for the perfect shot. They're just trying to hit it so they can hit it in the ass or in the neck or wherever the fuck they hid it. If they have poison, that thing's going to die. You know, they used poison for a lot of weird shit to the, uh, use poison to fish. It's really strange. They tape this season. The fish. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. They take this plant and they smash it up

Speaker 4:          00:52:12       and they make this green. That was, that the Yanomami may have, um, some more, maybe Bolivia or something like that. It's one of those tribal peoples that lives almost, almost uncontacted, but still some like w they'll have like under armour tee shirts on and it's weird. It's weird, but you know, the barefoot and they take these plants and I forget what the planet is, but they smash this plant up and make like this green pulp. And then they put this pulp in these ponds and these fish just float. It's some sort of toxin and it just fucks these fish up and they just float up to the top and then they'd go and scoop the fish and take them out of there, but it like paralyzes them.

Speaker 2:          00:52:53       It's not toxic to us, I guess. I don't know man. I mean maybe they lit up, but I guess you have to be really fucking hungry to think, okay, I'm not killing enough or getting enough fruits or vegetables. I'm going to poison these things and I'd rather die being poisoned than starving to death. Well, I think

Speaker 4:          00:53:11       full have been on the edge of survival, like they've figured out survival down to like everything in their area. They know what's edible. They know what's dangerous, what to avoid, what to cultivate, what to seek

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       out. They just, you know, they know how to do it, so if these people are on, if it's a resource rich island and it seems to be like an island in the middle of the ocean, as long as they don't kill too much, as long as they keep a certain healthy population of animals around are cognizant of that as this. These people, yes, the video I found in 2008 where some fishermen or someone found them and them coconuts. Wow. So these people apparently, um, if you, if you follow the story, they came from Africa 60 something thousand years ago and I guess probably during the ice age the coastline was very different, right? The water levels were way lower and then when the ice melted, the oceans rose and then we get, we got now. So maybe it was a much larger island or maybe it was like the bearing landmass where you could get across it.

Speaker 3:          00:54:19       Fuck your friends. Speak a language that no one else not even close to anything else since it's been so long. Fuck man. Here's combined with Lang throw it here is combined with body language who seemed to have a link. So they were like telling him to throw things and they'd given him coconuts. That's pretty cool. It's crazy how friendly they are without knowing who the person is and where they're from. Well, I mean the dude's giving them free food, so I think they're pumped. You get a bunch of free. Coconut is definitely a way to come friends with people, that guy, if that guy had coconuts instead of a Bible, probably through bibles, they're like, fuck it. Tried to eat the Bible up there. Like, motherfucker, look at that. Imagine some guy just showing up and giving you free food. Can you see my Dick?

Speaker 3:          00:55:08       Is that what is, what is this video? Some videos. Outrageous. That's a real translation. Yeah. Yeah. I, I really. Um, so it says a wooden act similar to a mountain acts. Yeah. That's a fucking crazy looking carried by all men. So they. Yeah. So they might not even have like metal. It seems like if he's got a wooden acts, I wonder if they have what they're using for arrowheads and stuff like that. This kind of fucking interests. Oh dude is fascinating man. The thing is, it's really what's weird about it is you can't really go there like Jay, you guys ever read or watched that movie about the city ofZ , the lost city of z? Is that what it was called? It was about an explorer from England who made his way to South America and eventually got eaten by cannibals. Allegedly, they think, oh, but he was looking for this last Mayan or Aztec city.

Speaker 3:          00:56:03       Was it a Mayan city? Lost City of Z. Amazon. Yeah, so he was looking for some, you know, apparently, and they've. They know this for sure now. There's some really, really, really ancient cities in the Amazon and they don't know what they are. They don't know from when. They don't know who built them, so they don't even know who it's different culture. Well, it's a culture that's long gone and it's the area where they had the city has been absorbed by the jungle, so they, they find it, I think either from satellites or from some kind of imagery where they're noticing these really obvious grid patterns that indicate irrigation and that they had fields and they had streets and so this. There's this English explorer. What was the gentleman's name? Harry Faucet. Here's the book's not bad. Percy Percy Fawcett and so this, this dude went to the jungles of Brazil multiple times looking for this lost city of gold to 18, 60.

Speaker 3:          00:56:58       So yeah. So he was really, it's a cool movie, but not, it's not the best movie, but it's cool because it's like you get to see the lost city of z. He found it before he was killed. No, no, no. Like he found something. He found that I don't want to spoil the movie, but it's um, it's not a bad movie. What's interesting to me is that these people, you just got to put yourself in the mind of people that lived in 1860 and they literally had no idea what the fuck was going on in South America. They just. But someone would come back and say, author has a story of his jetties down the jungle river and the guy would stand up. We met the uncontacted tribe and they would talk about, I have brought back pod pottery and this is a spearhead and you know, and here's drawings of the animals that I saw as get drawings of crocodiles and fucking giant Paranas and shit.

Speaker 2:          00:57:50       It must, must've been guys that made that shit up though, like the difference between a guy that actually had real pottery and just me getting my wife, hey, make a full will. You know, that happened with the dinosaurs, right? That people would pretend to say I have seen dinosaurs like in Australia. No, no, no. When, when they first discovered that a dinosaur was a thing, some people started faking it and they would come up with fake dinosaurs to a disorder, like boost their science credit and these are like legitimate people or thought to be, you know, the credibility accountability rather back then was not what it is today. Like you don't. I don't think the peer review process was the sound of these fucking people were maniacs out there just trying to pretend that they found dinosaurs. So they use like go fuck a buffalo park or some shit.

Speaker 2:          00:58:37       And they're like, look what I found. I can't believe it's right here. I mean I was just digging randomly. Even now though, even if you found bones from an elephant and you said, Hey, I dug this out in Vermont. People like people would be like that camp. Well, what is that thing that's like nine feet long for a little while and then you know, actual scientists will get ahold of it. I go, well, this is an elephant bone. You fucking idiot. This is a dinosaur. But if we were in 17, 46. Yeah. What year was it when they did that with the dinosaur thing? Yeah, there were some sort of like a battle, like everybody's trying to discover the latest and the greatest. They'd pee shit together. It didn't belong. It was. There was some weird wackiness. But you know what's fascinating to me is that something has to

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       die in like mud or it has to die and it has to be at the bottom of the ocean or a lake in silk. Something has to happen to preserve those bones because if it doesn't then you get nothing. That's why we don't, we don't know Jack Shit about what like octopus look like with Octopi looked like $5 million years ago, 60 million years ago. Like, like the cracking, like that could have easily been a real thing. Right. A fucking super enormous octopus that could eat whales because there are some big fucking words. I've seen some videos. Yeah, but they don't have. There's no bones. No. They just die in mud. Yeah. It has to tie in something to become fossilized now. Yeah. It's weird. It is. When you're seeing that fossil, do you know that that's not really the bone that has all the mineral that has replaced the bone over like thousands and millions of years or whatever it takes?

Speaker 3:          01:00:15       Yeah. When something's fossilized, like if you see like a fossilized shark tooth and it's black, that's not the real color of the teeth. It's the color of all the minerals that have replaced what the tooth used to be as it remains compressed and all this sludge and mud and shit over millions of years. It's pretty freaky shit. So like when you see these dinosaur bones, they're like, they're fossilized. A lot of them, like a lot of the bones that we find a dead things they've become like a piece of rock to could look completely different because I've heard people say that most dinosaurs that we look at now that we think about how they look, they really had feathers now thing. I just assumed that the sound of Jurassic Park is correct. Probably isn't. Whatever the fuck they sounded like. They might not have made any noise here.

Speaker 3:          01:00:58       The great dinosaur fossil hooks. Oh, the new one. China has enjoyed unprecedented gold rush of feather dinosaur fossils, but how many are real? Yeah, there have been some feathered fossils. If you go to the. There's a museum in Montana and Bozeman in the museum, some sort of science museum, and they have a one of those rappers, a velociraptor with feathers, like a model of it, like a life size Velossa, like like a freaky demon. That my first thing you ever want to see before you die. I'm afraid of birds, so imagine how fucking big bird like that. I lose my fucking mind. Here it is. Here's the bone wars. The great dinosaur rush. A period of intense and ruthlessly competitive fossil hunting and discovery during the gilded age of American history, marked by the heated rivalry between Edwin drinker cope drinker. That's what Middle Lane Bro of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. And whilst this guy's name authentic real othniel, what do you say that is off Neil Othniel Charles Marsh of the peabody museum of natural history of the year. Each of the two paleontologists use underhanded methods to outdo each other in the field, resulting resorted to bribery, theft, and the destruction of bones.

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       East scientist also sought to ruin his rivals reputation and cut off its funding. Use the attacks in scientific publications. So this doesn't seem like these are the people that were using fake stuff. I was like a fake shit. Yeah, this. If this was happening, they probably fake shit. People are all crazy man. Those guys like doing that. You can tell like at first that were real scientists and then they became famous and they're like, oh shit. I like being famous. Imagine if I enjoy being a famous scientist in scholar. Both the Chinese one. What are you getting now from and also the Chinese is not known for making counterfeit stuff, so I don't believe that article. Right. That's what they do. They make whole cities. They made Paris. If you go to China, there's a Paris. I was in China, I get a tour of China like two years ago and there's one of the guys bugging me.

Speaker 1:          01:03:11       He told me his, his girlfriend loved France and there's a neighborhood in Shanghai. It's exactly like France. So he brought her to France and then she was like, not the Chinese ones better because it's the exact replica and they do that now in the Arab. My knees one is better. She says Emirates, they redid the. They, they redid a, I think the, the Sorbonne and the like. They redid buildings from France. So you're in the Arab Emirates and your. Everything is exactly the same as it is in France except it's all like Saudis and people from Kuwait was a weird thing to do. Try to recreate a historical building that still exists. Yeah. Yeah. Put that effort into creating something. You have no white people copy. I think it's because they like it, it's probably complicated to to cause they're like, oh fuck, we're gonna go to go to whatever country is going to be food.

Speaker 1:          01:04:14       It's a food. Going to be Halau. Is it going to be complicated to go the mosque? Fuck it. Let's just next to the mosque and we'll be good. This is enough oil money floating around. They could probably build a whole world out in the desert. They could visit New York City. Here we are, New York to fake Manhattan, Brooklyn Bridge cab drivers or river fucking makeover. They're such dicks like that. Building the biggest building in the world in Dubai. When you go in, in the elevator, they turned the lights off and it becomes kind of like a ride and then it starts going up and then it shows, okay, we're at the level that the biggest building in New York City, like the empire state building is here at like whatever, 300 meters and then this is the biggest building in Shanghai and then they. So they want to just show, look, we got in the elevator, the elevator, like they're like, no bitch.

Speaker 1:          01:05:07       Yeah. I said, well, money since they did, like the first time I was in Dubai, the biggest building was a, I don't know how big, but they built one in Dubai and then the year after Shanghai beat it by like three meters. And then Dubai was like, fuck you, we're going to beat you by 500 meters. So it's like a, it's a kilometer or almost like a, like more than half a mile high. It's crazy high. More than half a mile high. Yeah. That's St and the city, would you say it that way? You look and the city in the 19 seventies didn't really exist. So it was like, this is fucking insane. Like the national anthem could be the eye of the tiger. It's fucking insane how big it got so quickly. But they're all so fucking wretched. It's insane. Jamie, what were you going to say? Uh, as you were saying that, like, I don't know why I'd definitely be registered before, but king's island, which is a theme park in Ohio and Cincinnati area, there's the Eiffel Tower there. There's also one somewhere else at another park. Oh really? I didn't say exact replica. One third replica. Eiffel Tower that's been there since like the seven. But all those rich Arab countries will be like, instead of one third seven times vague made of diamonds. You can see, you can see this Eiffel Tower from the moon. Gucci, everything.

Speaker 1:          01:06:30       Yeah. It's weird. People do that. But you know, when you had that kind of money, man, you make me a France. What else am I going to do for their friends? I want the countryside, the whole thing, man, I want you to know I want to turn away because you're like, make it like now your puck has gotten so big in three years. I want to hear Joe Rogan Belt Rome. He's got a fake robe.

Speaker 3:          01:06:54       Oh, that's why to five compound somewhere. Don't dumped off. Start selling a freeze dried food. Preparing everybody know water purification tablets. Get ready solar panels.

Speaker 1:          01:07:08       Did you like dishes? Did you. Is Your House okay? Yeah, we got lucky. We got lucky that someone said Google this, that Malibu last six,

Speaker 3:          01:07:17       600 houses. What? Yeah, someone said that the other day, but everyone's hysterical. It's hard to know if they're right or not. How many houses got lost at Malibu? Because I know a lot of people that have lost houses. I know at least eight people that have lost houses.

Speaker 1:          01:07:38       And how was the evacuation [inaudible]? Was it like area like you, you can just grab like one. One or two things. Grab

Speaker 3:          01:07:46       my laptop. 1,500 structures. 1,500 totally destroyed Jesus Christ. So the number probably keeps going up, but those are. A lot of them are homes, you know, out of those 1500, I don't know how many of them are homes, but a lot of them are. A lot of people lost their homes. It's a, it's a crazy thing that happens. The wind gets behind that fire and everything's dry and it just goes straight to the water and there's almost nothing they could do. They lost so

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       many houses on point dume, which you would think, how the fuck is a fire going to get to that? Like if you ever see what point dume is, it's like this beautiful area of very wealthy people live in this, this cliff overlooking the ocean. I mean spectacular and like you would never think that a wildfire we get there, but it was raining fire man. That's point dume out there. So, so many of those houses got cooked man and there's videos that people made of them leaving their horrific. There's like fire raining from the sky everywhere you look houses on fire and this is a super exclusive, really rich area and no one could protect it. There was nothing they could do. The firefighters did their best. They saved as many structures as they can, but it was fucking raging man. It was a rocks throw from my house when we left.

Speaker 4:          01:09:04       We left at 2:00 in the morning, Thursday night. The traffic, because the traffic is always crazy. So when you evacuate and the traffic's like that must, you must freak out. Scary is what happened to the people in paradise, California, they were evacuating and something like 60 plus people died in their cars. The fire just overcame cars and there's nowhere to go and they're stuck in gridlock and the fires literally coming at them ready for this 80 football fields a minute. That's how fast it was. Traveling at some. At one point. See what happens over the summer. There's a town right outside of Athens, Greece. Yet wildfires took over. The town was wiped off in a couple of minutes. People died in their cars and homes. You couldn't get out. They were just traveling. That's what happens in paradise. I think a lot more than a thousand people are missing paradise.

Speaker 4:          01:09:54       Yeah. They don't even know and the problem is they'll never know like whatever was there is incinerated. There's nothing left. Like they won't be able to get DNA that it's over. I mean it's the craziest fire they've ever experienced it. I think it's the scariest, most destructive California wildfire ever, and that one, the one down here was nothing compared to that one in northern California and comparison to the size and scope. I mean that thing is fucking insane. There's fire, there's a photo of this one. Firefighter has sort of iconic photo. He standing on a rock and behind him the whole mountain is on fire and it's just like holy shit. And people in my friend Brendan Child was doing a show in Sacramento, in Sacramento, out his hotel room. The whole street was filled with smoke. You couldn't see shit. He's like, dude, smoke is everywhere. And he sent me a photo of the television that was showing the air quality was very poor. Air Quality everywhere, all through that area. It's just all in red. So it was all like people were walking around with masks on and it would literally be like you're walking through a fire. There's smoke everywhere. Nuts, Matt. And this is in Sacramento? Yeah. Fuck yeah. Is it contained now? Sort of contained? I mean

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       the one here is, but I don't know about the one that's up north, but the real issue is that could happen again like that. Like they all, they're all. They sparked up so quick and more hit. What's the plan that they could do to make sure this doesn't happen or is there something they can do? I don't know. I don't know what they can do. What does that Jamie. The air quality in San Francisco is so bad. Being there for a day is like slow smoking. 10 cigarettes. Fuck. Look at that picture. That's all. Fire smoke where people like Western mass, I guess people are wearing masks. They're like, uh, yeah. Yeah. Bert Kreischer was walking down the street with a mask on and I. I texted him, what the fuck are you doing man? He's like, dude, it is so bad. It's so bad. Here it goes.

Speaker 3:          01:11:57       You can't believe how smokey the era's and there's just all through San Francisco. Everybody's coughing and wearing masks in Sacramento looked even worse than that. It's kind of shit you never think about. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's the thing. It could just hit you look at that data at San Francisco right now and if you don't know San Francisco, you wouldn't know how shocking this is. Like you. You can't see the hills. Can't see all those houses in the hills. It's all just smoke from the fire for that shit to blow out. It looks like San Francisco super like just. Yeah. Hey, is that fire contained? A article with a couple of couple of days ago said it was at 57 percent contained and I was just trying to google more. How about that? Only 57 percent contained at the air's a little clear today. They're at moderate to severe whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:12:46       But see, the thing is man, but these fires, all it needs is one gust of wind, one new storm, one new Santa Ana winds pick up some embers and then whoosh. This whole state is just dries. Fuck man to 80 percent, but 80 percent contained going gonna rain tomorrow. Hopefully that does. It's supposed to rain tonight, isn't it? It's fucking like everyone who moved out here, like from out East Lake when you moved here, you've been here for 20 years, 20 years. You must have been scared the first couple of years of earthquakes, but you never thought that, hey, I might have to leave my house because of fire. Dude, I've been evacuated three times because of. Because the fire. Yeah, Shit. Yeah. How many, how many major earthquakes since you've been here? None. One minor one. It was enough to let you know like Whoa, like when it happens and the, the, the house seemed like a, you ever get a refrigerator and you take out that cardboard box and you stand inside of it as a kid and you'd push it around back and forth.

Speaker 3:          01:13:52       That's literally what the walls of my apartment looked like. Oh. He just started moving like this. Like it was very different than I thought. I thought it would be like shake, like rumble. Everything would shake. No, it was just like this dome, Dome, doom, doom, doom, doom. But it was so nothing. It was a nothing earthquake. It was like a five point or some shit or five point seven, but it was enough to where when the walls moved you realize like, Whoa, if a big one happens, this shit just falls apart. Like this is not this thing. Ain't gonna make it houses just fall apart. The walls would just break. Will floor. Were you on a second floor? That must. That must like if you're on the ground floor, you go, okay, I can run out the shit we can't, but she lands in your head as you're trying to get at, but you know how fucking stupid humans are.

Speaker 3:          01:14:41       We go like, Nah, I got this. I can. I can run out the second floor. I think the opposite. I was thinking if I'm going to top floor, I'll serve my way to the bottom. I'll land on all these fuckers below me a dead. He's not going to make it. Yeah. It was enough to just let me just realize like you don't even know what an earthquake is. Stupid. Like my idea of an earthquake was like a cartoon movie. Like, oh, we're in an earthquake, but a real earthquake is just the earth shifting. It actually moves and apparently the people that were here during the big one of 1993, it was at 93, something like that. The earth moved almost like water, like the. You could see the earth just bucking and moving and you could see like chunks of it like lifting up and then settling down.

Speaker 3:          01:15:27       The people that were there, when you talk to them, it's like there's, I mean it's not ptsd like soldiers ptsd or like rape survivors or anything, but there's, there's absolutely some ptsd to comes from natural disasters. Is this trauma to seeing how fucking meager you are in comparison to the earth itself as the earth is moving, like fuck, I got to get out of here and then a mass exodus, like bunch of people move to Colorado and people moved all over the fucking place. Carla was nice though. Here. Colorado. It's gorgeous. Yeah. I'm surprised at the now with the wildfires, are people leaving California or no? Um, I'm sure some are. Yeah. The problem is the weather's so good. It's so nice because it never rains. It never does anything. You just, you can be just a lazy bitch. Just didn't ever have to deal with mother nature. Like, well you guys live here in Montreal, right? Yeah. That's no joke. Nuts. They're having a snow storm right now. That cold that you guys get up there as ruthless. I'm going to be in Toronto in December. Okay, cool. I'm there for the UFC and I know it's going to be cold as fuck. December it's going to have. Plus this year is generally the winter starts later than now and it's super cold, right? Yeah. What happened to global warming? Global warming.

Speaker 3:          01:16:52       That's the first thing like those fucking hardcore righties want to do whereas doesn't exist. It's slope warming. Weird. Where's your global warming? Like hippies. That simple pitch. It's burning the fucking houses in Malibu. Something. Yeah. And that what's really funny is the chem trail people, they've been convinced this whole time that the government is trying to make it rain. Like if ever there was a time to utilize chem trails, would it be now, you know, fuck man. The whole thing is a, it's very disconcerting because you realize how fragile the whole system is and these, you know, these people that worked so hard to save everybody, they can only save so much, you know, and they can only save so many buildings. You can only save so many people. It's a real wake up call. Man. Shit could get ugly and this off topic, but off topic of the fires, but because, uh, yesterday we're talking about red band at the store and I didn't know that when the whole thing happened, you were banned the whole crew for like seven years, like a long time.

Speaker 3:          01:17:57       I've talked about this too many times. The only thing I will tell you is because you took a bullet for the seven years is kind of like you took a bullet for everyone else was going to have to deal with that shit, but you didn't know at the time the ads or to looking back. I was just like, fuck them. Yeah. You can say I was taking a bullet, but I didn't think of it that way. But yeah, it's a thing. The subjects beaten down too much, you know, we're going through it now. That's why on our end now we have the people who are making money by stealing jokes. You have that going on in France?

Speaker 1:          01:18:24       Yeah. No, it's actually a French guy was doing it. Not with a French comedy. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's not in, in Canada, but it's in France. And there, uh, there was, uh, I own a club in Montreal and I banded guide this summer. He's, um, he had stolen a bunch of material. There's a thing called the GML comedy club that it's basically like how even when you say comedy club, when you were saying something in French first you have to see comedy club. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So, because that's the way you say that. This guy, um, he, he had stolen a pretty much everything from def comedy jam and they did it there in France and just didn't with French language. Even with black dudes. Like if you're going to steal def comedy jam, give it to French black dudes. Like there are black dudes in France, but it was all these Arab guys. So whenever you see like for uh, 10 years in France, whatever you sign an Arab comic, they were all like, like Dave Chappelle. So there was, yeah, there was something very fucked up. And this summer there was, the guy was in my club and then I found out and I fucking lost my mind and I just, I, I tweeted a, my door guy. And I was like, get him the fuck out everyone. He's with you throw them out. I don't want them in the club strangers thing. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:19:42       With comedy, you're trying to create things and some basically a criminal can sneak in the middle of an artist's colony and just start profiting off of your work and intimidating you and making you work for them essentially.

Speaker 1:          01:19:56       Yeah. There's something that sucks and people don't know. And that's what you went through with when, when you called out Carlos, no one cares. No one cares like they do now. They do see the

Speaker 2:          01:20:07       thing is they don't know your situation up there is different, but the only reason they do now because it looks good. But if didn't like, like, um, like banning Carlos now. Like Carlos Mencia can't work anymore. That it makes them look like we respect comedians, but they don't really respect Comedians, I don't think. Well, who's they in this? You sound like you're a conspiracy theory. They don't respect us, man. No, but like whenever, whenever I've called out a joke thieves to, to festivals or networks, they're like, okay, yeah, yeah. We're gonna. We're gonna. Do something about this and then as soon as it blows over, they don't do anything about it. Yeah. Well, you're talking about festivals, right? You know, I think, um, clubs would be much more likely to band people, especially if someone who they're stealing from also works there. That's, that's more likely to happen.

Speaker 2:          01:21:02       Especially if the, you know, when in best case scenario the person who's getting stolen from is already established and successful. So they could say something about it. The worst case scenario, someone who's established steals from open microphone, which fucking does happen. And um, you know, if there's anything that you'd get someone to quit comedy, that might be one of them, well, you know, there might be one that might be, especially in the beginning having only good jokes stolen by a person who does it on television. And then you have to watch it on comedy central a couple days later. You're like, what? And you remember that that guy had been in the back of the room a couple of weeks ago and watched your act and yet. And then you're like, what? Like, you can't even believe it. There's a comic and France named a Gad Elma lay. Who is he?

Speaker 2:          01:21:47       He's in New York now and he's, he's, he works a lot in English. He did a, uh, um, he has these rumors and I'm going to say allegedly because I don't want to get to, don't get sued. But uh, he, he, uh, I know that he, he's taken a couple. At first he took a couple bits from American comics, then he got caught. So he started stealing from a French Canadian comics. And the last thing I heard he did was he had this contest for open Mike [inaudible] and he was like, my next comedy tour, uh, send me your three best minutes on tape and the best comic. I'm going to book a top and for me. And then he started stealing from those open micros, which is a, that's such a garbage move. It's a wacky. Yeah. Well, I didn't tell them you're a good person.

Speaker 2:          01:22:34       Yeah, I don't like it. That's what I heard. I'm not sure it's true, but I saw him do a show once in, in France and he was a like, he's a rich dude. He's, he's got his own private plane and uh, yeah, he's got his own private plane. He was, he was married to the Princess of Monaco so he's got a lot of money and he was doing, he was doing a bit, a bit like he's just a, he was doing a bit about how he can't afford an air conditioner in this apartment and I was like, mother, you have

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       a kid with the princess of Monaco. I can afford like multiple air conditioners. Fuck you. Well you know, it's not good though. The people care like there are people do care. Some people care. Here's the thing. The problem is saying no, they don't get sounds like paper like that. All white people are racist. You can't say it. Yeah. Like I know the whole thing in France a lot. The new generation of French French comics are really angry about this and there's a guy, there's this youtube as a channel that you talked about here when you had, I think it was Tom Papa though is on a, it's called copy comic and they take like bits that they'll take a bit from a comic from here and then they just to show that what's going on. But someone friends. Yeah. Just to educate them.

Speaker 3:          01:24:01       Yeah. Um, I've, I've talked to quite a few comics from countries that are bilingual that say this is a. Montreal was very bilingual. In fact, almost everybody speaks French, right? Yeah. Uh, yeah. Almost everybody speaks English. It's like probably one of the most bilingual places and bought definitely in Canada, but there's not a place like that in America. There's no place like that in North America now. Even thinking North American terms of United States, like there's no place that's kind of universally speaks Spanish and English, you know, it's like some people speak English, some people speak Spanish, but very few people. I mean, you can't this the numbers. It's never like Montreal is like probably probably 80 percent speak both languages, right? Yeah. That's crazy. It's a beautiful city, man. It's amazing, but you're fucking freedom of speech laws, dog shit. Fuck. Fucking didn't exist. Well, that's. You're going to create shitty art when you have that.

Speaker 3:          01:24:55       You know the way that you punish someone who you think is doing something awful with their speech. As long as they're not calling for someone to be murdered or something. Right. The way you do it, as you don't go to their show, you say, I don't want to support you, and then that's it. You don't find them. If enough people don't like you and your you have a message of hate and won't come out, you will make money. You're gonna, you're gonna. Stop doing it. That's how you kill that. I definitely don't think you should have a message of hate, but I don't think that certain people should be able to side what's hateful because they keep pushing that boundary the same way. They push all the other boundaries. They'll push the boundaries of what, what, what is? What's the definition of prejudice? What's the definition of entitlement? What's the definition? You are you always coming from a place of privilege? So are you always entitled? Are you always racist? Do you. I mean, you know, they have those, they have to do this with corporations and there's no evidence that it works at all. They do unconscious bias, like counseling or they sit down with their employees and they talked to them about perhaps

Speaker 4:          01:26:03       this unconscious racism they might have. And so everybody's like, fuck, am I racist? And they'd go next. So shitty. It's so crazy. But what's crazy about it is that all it is is like they needed a response to a perceived situation, which I'm sure is the situation in many, many places don't. I'm not trying to minimalize that, but they needed a response. So the response to something totally unscientific, not support, but at least they can say they're doing something. They have a, you know, racism bias training and they have these people sit down and they talked to you about like, this is what you do. You know, if a person of color walks in this, everybody's like, Chad and I want to be racist, but it, I don't think it works man, and I don't think it's, it's not the way that racism sucks and the way to stop racism is be a good person.

Speaker 4:          01:26:52       Yeah. Like the more good people we have, they will inspire more good people. We will all realize that racism is fucking stupid and we should treat people as individuals always. Whether it's by gender, my sexual preferences, origin of your, your ancestors. I don't care. I mean I care in terms of like sexual preference, I, Karen terms of whether I think you're attractive or not. I care in terms of like whether I decide, you know, the to, you know, like there's some people that want to hang out with really loud people. There's some people that want to hang out with people that are like more demure or some people that are more introspect. Everybody likes different Shit. You're allowed to like different shit, but you're not allowed to discriminate against someone and keep them from occupation or keep them from place to live. And if we all thought that way and just treated people on the merits of their own individual personality and character, we'd have a way better world.

Speaker 4:          01:27:48       I think we could all agree to that. As soon as you get into these groups of all white people or all Asians are all like, fucking come on man. That's too small. That's such a gross generalization. It's too small of a common denominators to weird the what, what you are like, how much of what you are is where the fuck you're from and shit, you can't control how much melanin you have in your skin. That's ridiculous. What you are is all the things you've experienced and all the life you've lived and all the lessons you've learned where you are at this moment. You know. And if I like you at 30, I might not apply to you when you were 18. You might've been fucking annoying. But I meet you when you're 30. And I'm like hey, you're cool. You know, and everything's great. And that should be okay too.

Speaker 4:          01:28:27       It's not like we have to distinguish between people just being not interested in talking to any one individual and what is wrong with with gross generalizations and then tribal ideas of like sticking to only people of European ethnicity and these are the good folks of European descent, like you're fucking crazy. Civilization's been down that road stupid. You can't do that shit again and you can't do it for Asians either. You can't do it for black people. You can't do it for anything. You can't say everybody's great in this group because it's nonsense. It's so simplistic. It's not just simplistic, it's dangerous, and it also makes people scared to say anything about like, I don't want you to think of that. I hate the thing. I left blank. The thing I like about not censoring hate speech is if you let hateful people say hateful things, you know where the dangerous people are.

Speaker 4:          01:29:21       So if you're censoring like you can't use this where you can't say this. You can't say that. You don't know who the fucking Weirdos are at that hate black people. They hate gay people that hate the translator because everyone's acting exactly the same. Like everything's cool, and then when they're with their friends or whoever, the people that that think like them, then they're buting all their fucking hate and shit and garbage. Well, whenever people can express themselves freely, there's going to be some sort of suppression and if there's some sort of suppression, there is a resentment of that suppression. And then there's just like this anxiety and this tension. You know, it's like when he would. It's essentially what we're saying is when you think about people in business meetings, how they're forced to communicate, how this forced to address how they're forced to communicate that go into this very professional building.

Speaker 4:          01:30:11       All the women are dressed professional, all the men to dress professional. They all get together in these conference tables and everyone is agreeing. Even those, these are sexual beings who may be like cocaine, you know, and they, they've been fucking, you know, that they, they've, they've been to music festivals and they've maybe been to burning man and, but they're contained that contained in this room and they're talking about statistics and talking about probabilities and then someone brings up diversity. Yes. Diversity, all very important and everyone is behaving and this super weird world where you can't, you can't move outside the box even remotely if you, if you move outside the box even a little, if you say you know about the guy from Netflix that got fired because he used the n word in a descriptive. He was, he was talking about Tom Segura special. We're Thompson was talking about changes in language and just talked about some words can't say anymore and he says like, you can't say retarded.

Speaker 4:          01:31:10       He says this just because he said that just because he said that people were getting angry at him and protesting and groups. We're trying to boycott Netflix, remember? Right. So this guy, I don't remember his name, but he was one of the big wigs at Netflix and he said he was like, it's like saying the word nigger to an African American person. That's what it's like to say retarded to a family where someone has someone who's downstairs. So he was defending, he was talking about how offensive that word is to people. So I was like, this is the issue that we're dealing with. So you just talked about it at a very matter of fact way. They report him for saying the word and he gets fired and apparently he did this twice. This is what I've read in the same context. Yes. The same

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       exact context. So he's repeating this thought. It's basically having a. they're doing an intellectual exercise like is this, is it the same to you? And he's saying it around African American people, but in saying it around African American people, just the fact that he said the word uttered it like Abracadabra. Just saying it was enough for him to lose his very high profile job at Netflix was apparently well liked. And it really. Do you think we're becoming like this because our lives are too easy? That like if we had to struggle to get food and and protect our families, we wouldn't be worried about this word or that word or my feelings. One hundred percent. Yeah. I think we're. We're, we're seeking out altercations when we. Because I think we're programmed for a certain amount of interaction with people that's unpleasant. We're, we're, we're a program for a certain amount of competition, whether it's verbal or physical.

Speaker 3:          01:32:54       We're programmed for it. I think it's what got us to 2018 in terms of the crazy history of the human species is it marched across the world. So imagine leaving Africa. What woody got animal skins on your feet and you're walking out. What the fuck were those people and what kind of people they encounter? That's our ancestors. Our ancestors had just been dealing with bullshit forever and when there's no bullshit, there's some bullshit over there. There's 78 different gender pronouns motherfucker. And the reason why you don't think so because you're a cis gendered white privilege piece of Shit and all white people are racist. And then you start tweeting up a storm, those if you go to those people's pages, one of the things that I, I'll, I'll find a person who says like preposterous shit and if I'm not blocked by them from some gigantic autoblocker, which sometimes they do these block everybody.

Speaker 3:          01:33:42       But if someone I'm not blocked by them, I will bookmark them. So instead of like following them so they know I'm from, I would just bookmark them so I'll just go back. So I have a file on my computer called crazy motherfuckers and I will go the crazy motherfuckers page and I'll see them go through these manic depressive states and freak out about the world. And then every now and then something will get tossed in there about relationships. You know? I mean yeah, because I know, I know it is, it is harder for someone of color like a black or Arab or you know, Asian around some people around some people. Yeah. But saying white privilege, like there are a lot of white homeless men. And whenever I say a white homeless dude, I always want to give them money and go white, white privilege do.

Speaker 3:          01:34:27       There's no doubt there's an advantage in this current climate and world to being white. The problem is the white people are not guilty of doing anything just because they're privileged, right? So instead of calling it white privilege, well we need to concentrate on is the people that are racist. That's the only real problem. The only problem is racist people. And even though white people get discriminated against less, the problem was saying things like black people can't be racist because racism is a power thing and bite people have power over black people. That's it's. It's a

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       fucking intellectual forest. They know it is when they're saying it and it's just one thing that they just repeat and you're supposed to accept it. And it's a part of what we were talking about earlier where there's a game that's going on and the game is, I want you to say the 78 different gender pronouns I want you to say that I want you to do that. I want you to refer to me is that I want you to for to me is this. I want you to do what I want you to do. Once you stop using certain language, I want you to start saying certain things because that means I win. It's counterproductive because you're not teaching anyone how stupid it is to just discriminate based on race. All you're doing is blocking out that. Being honest. I think that that doesn't even work anyway.

Speaker 4:          01:35:35       I think what really works is leading by example. I think that's the only thing that works. What I think we learned from what we've learned from people better than us. You see someone who is amazing and she's super smart and she's really kind to people who got, damn it. I got to be more like her. I think that's where we're missing that aspect of it. The chastising. See this is the problem with what goes on with the left in particular, the brutal mean assaults on people. These twitter gangs and facebook gangs, they target someone and attack them. You are not changing anything and in fact you are going to get people who see this horrible shit and they're going to go, fuck those people. I'm going that way, and they go the other way and you recruit people to be on the right, and this is literally how Donald Trump became president.

Speaker 4:          01:36:21       One of the, one of the major factors was people were noticing a trend and the trend was towards these crybaby, preposterous liberals that call it everything is racist. Everything is sexist. Everything is homophobic. Everything and everything falls into this blanket of transgression where there's no innocent and everyone's guilty and then when they find they run out of targets, they go after each other for not being progressive enough to start calling each other out to find jealousy in the movement. That's something that really makes me happy when I see people that have been calling people out for years and then they get caught out and I'm like, fuck, finally. Well, you know, I've seen it happen. I've seen it. I've seen it happen with people I've seen. I've seen them become. Jamie Kilstein is a friend of mine and Jamie Kilstein was at one point in his life this really progressive activist guy who was like, everything he said had to be like super male feminists and super trans positive and I mean he was trying so hard to be accepted but, but he's super honest about it too.

Speaker 4:          01:37:25       He's done a podcast about it and you know, he'd call people out and be really mean and really vicious. And then he realized he was getting all this anxiety from it. He had to check his twitter all day. He'd be walking the street, just couldn't stop, like checking his twitter, see what their replies were. And he was released. He was caught in this weird fucking hate spiral, you know, even though he was proporting, he was acting on the premise that he was a good person and he was going to call out all these bad people, but he was like addicted to this weirdness. And then it turned on him. It turned on him like some girls accused him of being creepy and it was like super minor, like trying to go on dates with people like just. But that was enough that it all you need is like one in that world, every in that world, everyone is so hyper progressive and looking for any sort of deviation from the pattern they can attack and they just decided that this guy, even though he had been like this model ally for, for a male as a male feminist and for people of color and gay stood for everything that they wanted to.

Speaker 4:          01:38:25       He's a piece of garbage because he's heterosexual, you know, and you know, apparently he worked with this girl or something like that, but whatever it was, I mean it was the most minor of transgressions. There was no rape, no touching, no, no meanness know, like. And so after all this was done, he came out on the other end and that it needed just came clean about like how he felt while he was doing it. Why did. It was very brave that he did that. But it gives you insight to a lot of like what is one of the problems of this unnavigable territory of social media is that it's very compelling to engage constantly and consistently with people in this, this really anxiety ridden wave of animosity that's going to run back and forth between the two of you for no reason. Most of the time for no reason

Speaker 2:          01:39:13       was free. The Nipple, a big thing here.

Speaker 4:          01:39:16       There was more New York like a lot of gals were. They decided they were going to protest, that men can be topless but they can be topless and they passed that right?

Speaker 2:          01:39:25       I, I had a friend that she was telling me and we had this conversation and she was like, no, but like a female female, breasts aren't sexual, so I should be allowed to shop. And I was like, look, you know that I know that my penis doesn't know. I'm sorry if I see tits. My Dick is going to get hard. I'm sorry. It's not like I respect you, but if, if you fucking pull your tits out, my Dick is going to get hard. We get, we do. We do for you, we were animals, but you know, it's also that we're just not used to seeing tits. Yeah. If tits were out all the time, they were actually get used to it. The problem is changing gears. Look at those people in that fucking dead island. They have weird tits. Tits. Someone needs to tell them they need nice west coast to the west coast.

Speaker 2:          01:40:15       Yeah. I don't know man. I think they should be able to do it though. They want to walk around topless, but the problem is there's too many dickheads. You're. You're running into a river of dickheads. You're going to try to go upstream through that with her tits hanging out. That's fucking true. You go to a bar, if you want to go to a bar top lists like, look, that is chaos that's going off the rails. Yeah, you definitely should be able to do it, but I don't think you should. If you were my friend. Like I said, if in an ideal world should be able to, yes, you should definitely be able to, but do I think you should do it? No, no, don't do that. People are going to try to suck them. They're going to try to grab them. It's like it's. If someone's going

Speaker 3:          01:40:53       to touch your tits, it's good. It's so rare. You have to be in the perfect bar in Asheville, North Carolina, and you can be there from 10 to two and nobody will touch your tits like one place. Someone's gonna touch your tits. People are gross.

Speaker 2:          01:41:06       Like even even when girls, Ariana Grande Grande's sang at aretha Franklin's funeral. Even that preacher tried to touch her test. He was going to grip. Yeah. So imagine if she had freed the nipple fucking crazy. He would have gotten who'd got pregnant.

Speaker 3:          01:41:23       But there's, there's no argument in saying that they shouldn't do that. Right? It shouldn't be a law. This is almost like mean you can make parallels to compelled speech because I don't think that you should be naked and just walk down the street if you're a girl, but you should be allowed. I don't think you should if you're my friend because I would say, listen, you're going to get harassed. It's is way more likely that you'll get raped, I would think. I mean, I'd like to know what the, I don't want to do a study, but I would like to know what the statistics look just make, make these people get raped, like just walk around for four of our subjects, got raped. You don't want, don't want to do that study. But um, I think um, if you live in a tribe like that uncontacted tribe outside of India, they're probably super accustomed to seeing people naked and it's, they probably act normal. It's probably not that big a deal where we're, you know, it's like, what's in the box man? What's in the box? And we will cover everything up. But the buys are all covered up or feed or whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:42:30       Remember, remember when we were young, like I'd see just a sears catalog, a woman in a bra and I jerk off and now like it desensitized. You start watching porn and then you're like, oh fuck. If someone had Mascara running, it's not gagging. It's, there isn't at least one murder in this. How can I get hard? Watch an action movie and nobody dies in a bitch ass movies this. But we're Weirdos. And everybody has their own weird quirk. It's I think a lot of times we don't admit it or we then you see someone who an extreme and you're like, oh fuck. At least I'm out that like we have an intern for for our podcast and he's hard to gold. Right? But he has a crippling addiction of prostitutes and just a weird guy, like when you meet him, he's just a fucking over the top. Weird. Is it crippling because you can't afford it. He's a weird. But he just said bad judge of character. So He. He picks all hookers that will steal money. He got robbed the other day. We've been here for two days. He was robbed and pepper sprayed.

Speaker 2:          01:43:38       She made a documentary on this guy. We're going to talk about it for awhile. Pro on this motherfucker. You can get that party role and that's what you do. You blur out faces and watch. What's his name? Poseidon. Poseidon gets his ass kicked by the name of the name of

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       the documentary. And it'd be your version of the naked woman walking around trying to knock it, right? Yeah. The way he told the story, like he was like, he, he talked to this woman and we were like, that's not a real picture. You're the shit you're going to get. She's going to steal, she's going to steal all your shit. And he was like, no, no, I think she's real. I think she's real. Or like, oh, she's not real. And then she came over to the house when we were doing a spot at the, at the store. And uh, she, she told them it's 300, he gave her $300. Then he tried to touch her and she was like, no, no, it's 300 just to meet, we need more money. And then they went out to a, like an ATM. He got more money, gave her the money, she brought it.

Speaker 1:          01:44:32       She went back to the apartment and then he pulled the Dick and she was like, no, we're not having sex. And then he was like, what? And then she, she ran away and pepper sprayed or like she ran it, he was still making it. So he said I tried to chase her, but she was fast in the hills and there's two flights of stairs and he slipped on the last ones because he has his boxer shorts and as soon as he stood up from the slip, she sprayed him in the face. She ran out, he ran three floors up to get dressed. And then you went out looking for her. But he's not gonna find finer. And then he shows up at the store. Belligerent. And was he naked when she pepper sprayed him? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, well, from what he told us, his boxers were stuck on his foot.

Speaker 1:          01:45:09       What? When, when he told us a story, we were like, I get, I get why she pepper sprayed you. Cause you're like, he's a, like, he's a big dude. And Poseidon is like fucking like 300 pounds, six five. And she's a singer. She's got a guy that's like 350 pounds with a rock hard dick going, you fucking whore. He was yelling. I know him. So he definitely said that. And we were worried because the airbnb that the owner lives right behind. And she's very nosy, she's nosy bitch. She keeps looking at what we're doing. So I'm like fuck, she's hearing this. And she said, be quiet. No glitter in the house, like weird rules litter. And I think we broke every rule, environmental person saying you shouldn't use glitter anymore. It gets to the fish. Oh, is that why she said the ocean? Because we didn't know why.

Speaker 1:          01:45:55       It was like, what? No glitter. Like who asks like, why am I was like you walk, you litter off the glitter goes into the drain. But glitter adventure, he gets into the water. Why would, like I told her we're going to be three dudes renting the apartment. Why would we bring glitter? Or maybe this is la. Yeah, no man. You were gone on before about you. Not. It's impossible for you to be a gay guy. You definitely could have been gay guy, a gay burlesque. But even if I was a gay guy, like I wouldn't. I wouldn't be a gay guy, I don't think would bro. Man, high heels, fishing nets, glitter. He'd go hard. Hard. And you'd have like some old timey clothes onto like a Charlie Chaplin Gay guy like Sherlock Holmes. Yeah, man. Old Timey, Charlie, Charlie Chaplin, gay stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:46:49       You know how, how hard it must have been in those days to be gay. Like coming out of the closet now. It's still hard in small towns. But imagine already even in big cities, man. Depends on your friend's parents. Yeah. Yeah man. Charlie Chaplin. Days Imagine. But there's probably a lot of gang shit going on. Like I don't think there's any difference in the number. I bet the numbers probably sound like this. It's exactly the same. I'm sure. Yeah. Cause even now people are saying now there are more, there are more transit in the weather, but there are more that are getting operations. But in the old days it was the same thing. I'm sure. Yeah. I bet the numbers consistent. Probably the percentage. It's probably more numbers now because there's more people. There were probably a bunch of gay dudes from the fifties that were actually trans women, but just because you couldn't get, you couldn't change anything, so you just suck Dick, you know, in private or whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:47:49       This is science. I'm a scientist book on this. Got a deep passion for this information. So you guys are on compound media. It's called a. it's called and drink minimum. We do shows. Do you have two drinks? And every show will have more than we do. Always have two drink minimum. Yeah. And we do have done a one drink show. No, but we do, we do one shots which are, we do free episodes, like just on itunes once a week, 30 minute show. And then on Fridays we do the two hour show on compound media and it's just a compound mediums, which is a nd Anthony Kumi is a thing. And Anthony, um, he's so fucking funny. He's a genius. He most people know him. He's such a wild man too. So crazy. And Anthony, if it wasn't open, anthony wasn't for open. Anthony podcast wouldn't exist. Like the format podcasting.

Speaker 2:          01:48:44       Every and now they're really good. Podcast, but the first couple of years of podcasts, like 2006, seven, whatever, most podcasts sounded like shitty versions of Opie and Anthony and now like, like was ones that we're trying to do like an hour long interview style podcast. It was more like a, you know, some npr type deal or something like that. And then um, we started doing, um, where there would be like a lot of comics just hanging around, hanging out and when, when we started doing those, which was like 2009 ish, that was clearly influenced by opie and anthony and also influenced even more so by Anthony Kumi is Internet show that he was doing last compound show? Yeah. Yeah, because I watched that and this is one of the big things that hit me because I realized I could do it because um, he just set it up in his basement.

Speaker 2:          01:49:38       I mean, he, he had some money and he decided to make a green screen and you've got these professional cameras. And then I thought about it while I was watching them. I was like, why don't I do that? I'm like, why am not doing that? Like he's got this whole setup in his basement and then there was this one time where he was drunk doing karaoke with a machine gun as, as you get a machine gun, any sig, and he's doing karaoke and I remember thinking like this crazy motherfucker I need to, I need to do a show now. I need to because now I'm saying this would be a lot of fun and I always enjoyed doing radio shows when I did them. I would do. I'm like, I would do opie and anthony even if I didn't have like tickets to sell, even if it was all sold out, I would still show up and go hang out with those guys because it was just fun.

Speaker 2:          01:50:23       Like a comic's table. Like it was just hanging out. Just break them both. I like this. I mean like we're doing right now. That's how it happened. You know, I'm doing it with those guys and watching anthony do it on his own and becoming friends with Jimmy, you know? And then seeing how it's fun to just hang out with comics. You did Anthony show a couple of weeks ago, couple weeks ago, but it hasn't aired yet. I don't think it's holding on to it to next week when he's, uh, he's actually going to be here because the third is, is new sidekick. Uh, Dave Landau is fucking insanely funny. He's really, really, really funny comic. Yeah. He's a comic from Detroit who now now lives in New York and I didn't know him. And like every, all of the open anthony fans were like, fuck, why? Why didn't he, I have Jamie.

Speaker 2:          01:51:12       Why doesn't he have Jimmy? Why doesn't he have a. Why doesn't, why doesn't own, ain't get back together. But Dave Landau and grant money. You Go, okay, this works. This is a very good company. Really good show. Yeah. He's a super nice guy too. First Smart Dude. And um, their setup is great. You know, the green screen behind them just turns it into whatever the fuck he wants it to be. And He's got a little stadium seating. So all the weird people. So something fun though about when his shell, like the first couple of times I did his show when it was in the basement of his house. There's something I like about doing those shows when you're, you're, you go into someone's house. Like I did Steven crowder show, uh, like a month ago and there was something cool about going in the suburbs of Dallas in his garage to do his show.

Speaker 2:          01:51:57       Supposed to say where he lives, man. Guys hiding. No, but yeah. But tell us. I'm sorry. I even crowder dies my fault. I was getting blamed tooth moved around a lot. Yeah. No, I know y'all. Yeah, that's true. But remember he did that a thing that Bob Ross Paints Muhammad to. I took ball. Yeah. I mean it's literally something that they're allowed to kill you if you do. And he did that allowed. Yeah, I mean it's strange time. I mean this is a, also a time where that, criticizing that, criticizing anything that's Islamic is very dangerous because people call you Islamophobic and because people want to kill you. So we've got two different things going on at the same time. But those same people will have no problem mocking Christians. I am. Yeah. Yeah. I'm, I'm

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       not even like, I'm not a right wing guy. I consider myself a little more to the left, but there's something I like about right wing media, especially like the funny type of right wing media that they take fucking crazy risks. You mean like Kumina, like, like Kumina, like crowder, like A. Steven crowder is really funny to like Gavin McInnes I think is fucking hilarious.

Speaker 4:          01:53:08       Gavin's in the crossfire and right now is the eye of Sauron is upon him. He's too much stupid shit about inciting violence. And now that there's some articles saying that the FBI considers him a, that the proud boys are hate group. But then Kumina sent me something that he sent him and I'll send it to you. He's saying it's

Speaker 1:          01:53:29       bullshit. The first time I heard about the proud boys I was doing Gavin shown New York and uh, he, he was with a Dante narrow, which is a, a black comic in New York. And he was like, Hey, uh, the, uh, me and him are in the proud boys. And I was like, what the fuck's the proud boys holding? Let's explain what it actually is. Because a joke, at first it was like, we don't jerk off, so the will want to fuck our wives. And then like four months later I was like, oh

Speaker 4:          01:53:57       Gavin McInnes quit the proud boys today. Well, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:54:01       Oh, is it today? I thought he had quit that years ago though. This just got posted. I think.

Speaker 4:          01:54:05       Think maybe Jamie, I'm sending you an article to where he's realizing how problematic it is to be connected with these people. And you know, look, it's one of those fucking things. You want to have a group, you can't control everyone in the group. So anybody in the group that does something horrible. I just sent you something. Pull this up. This is Gavin's response to all this because so many people got mad at me that I had Gavin on the first place. First of all I had Gavin on because used to be one of the founders of vice also because I had Gavin on before that and he was fun to hang out with. Then when I had them on, I've had them on the last time. One of the things that he was talking about was the proud boys. I didn't even know what the fuck that was.

Speaker 4:          01:54:43       I think maybe I'd heard of it, but I thought it was a joke. Turned out he used to be a joke. It started off as a joke on compound media and Anthony will get into a better. He knows the history of it, but they were making fun of something and they decided to make a fake mock group called the proud boys. Now the problem with this is when you have a group that's supposed to be fighting and the va and I actually tried to express this to him when he was on the show because he was talking about kicking people's ass. We're going to punch him in the face. I'm telling them to punch people in the face. I'm like, okay, that's not how reality works. Like, I don't know if you've ever been punched in the face or if you've been around people that like to punch people in the face, but you don't just punch someone in the face.

Speaker 4:          01:55:20       What happens is you punched him in the face, they come back with a bat, somebody gets a knife, people get guns. It always escalates. It's going to keep going. You don't just get away with punching people in the face, you know, and yeah, it's not good that these antifa people bring bike locks and smack people in the heads with them and that's kind of the point in that in the first place. Those people don't understand what happens when you start the chain of violence. When you started that domino. They don't understand what happens. They think that they're living in some fucking book that they love about some revolutionary liberal character that reaches out and and smashes all these oppressors of social justice. That's not reality and reality. You just hit a guy with a lock, was talking to you, you assaulted him with a deadly weapon, and the next thing you know they're going to kill you or they're going to beat you.

Speaker 4:          01:56:04       They're going to punch you. So when a guy like Gavin says something like, you should punch them in the face. I understand why he said that because they were inciting violence. These, these antifa people would hit people with things that were in masks. They, some of them, some of them were doing it nonviolently. Some of them just wanted what they thought was the right things to happen. But like all groups, you get a fucking big group. You can't control everybody in the group. And that happened with the proud boys too, I think. I think he decided to have this thing that was going to, you know, mockingly oppose Antifa. Then it became real and then it became violence. And just this is. This is just one of the problems that people have when there's a fucking group of people have post to another group of people and you know, him quitting the proud boys is definitely smart.

Speaker 4:          01:56:52       But I don't think it's going to help because now people are saying he's a white supremacist and what the perception that people have of you is almost important, almost as important as what you actually do. It's probably even more important almost because not for you and not for me, not for people that are gonna actually read into it, but for people in the outside, the perception of who you are, is it just too many things to learn? Okay, he's a racist. Oh fuck that racist. That's all people here. That's all they say. And then they keep moving. Meanwhile you've got a guy who's Gavin who, first of all, he's not even American. He's Canadian. Second of all, he's married to a native American woman. He is not a racist. He said he's a provocateur. One hundred percent. Unquestionably. He says ridiculous shit because he thinks it's funny, but he's a very bad situation.

Speaker 4:          01:57:38       Is almost a troll or like. I didn't even think like I've, I know him, like we're not good, good friends. But I, I, I liked them a lot and I'm pretty sure he's not even right wing. I think he's just fucking, he's definitely fucking with people and he definitely has some right wing ideas, but more than that, he doesn't like some of the ridiculous aspects of the left, so it's more in. It's again, like he's a more opposed some of the more preposterous notions of relapsed and he is really right. Yeah, but he's right on some things to a right wing on some things, but he came onto the show dressed like fucking Michael Douglas from falling down as a goof. He brought a freezer case and everything or a tie and a white short sleeve button up shirt. He did it as a goof. Like that's him. He's a. he's a weird guy. Is Funny. He says funny shit, but he. But in this, when you. There's two different ways you can go through life, right? He could pretend, put on an act or you can be yourself. What he's chosen to do is a little bit of both. He's chosen

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       to pretend a little bit but also be himself, so it's hard for people to know where the line is. That's fun. That's fun. If you're getting away with it. It's not fun when it turns on you and then you go, no, that part I was joking around about people like says who like who's who's right and who's wrong. Like it gets. It gets real slippery when people don't actually know who you are, where you stand. And I think he was, he thought it was fun to fuck with people a little bit on with certain things and in this climate man that can be fucking dangerous. Yeah, definitely. And Kaufman of 2018. No he's not. He's a different thing. He's, he's Gavin McInnes, you know, and I really, I'm sad that all this shit is going down and I hope it passes over and, and people get to understand me.

Speaker 3:          01:59:28       It's not a perfect person, but no one is. But what he has is an interesting guy. He was weird. Says Funny Shit. Did he take a shit on the air once on a show? He stuck his finger up his ass and shit up. He's not a bad guy. He's a maniac. Yeah. If there's something we're right now going on, like in 2018 that the left hates or right the right hates the left and we're all exactly the same. Or you know, a difference between what you said. Yes. The stupidity in the group. Just the whole group. I'm going to hate. Exactly like the worst common denominator. The worst common denominator. The worst actors in any group define that group. So whether it's, you know, people that are on the right. Look, there's a lot of people who are on the right whore, fiscally conservative but socially liberal and they just, they just don't think that you should spend money like crazy and they believe in discipline and they believe and you know, having an intelligent financial planning, you know, and there's, there's that as well as people who are socially democratic socialist.

Speaker 3:          02:00:32       I think you could spend all the rich people's money on all these other things. There's just as many people because they're like, there's a way broader spectrum, but you have to pick a side. I think most of us are like 90 percent in the metal and then there's the five five on each side that like, you're like, no, I'm more left leaning and then you see like extreme left and you're like, what the fuck is wrong with these people? Okay, I'm more right. And then you see the fucking Weirdos on the right. You're like, what the fuck? Like there's something very scary on both sides. Yeah. And when you see that scary thing, you want to pose that thing. So you become what? It's the op, you know, you become a left wing person, you decided, well we've got to stop trump no matter what.

Speaker 3:          02:01:09       Whatever is never trump. I mean there was a lot of that going on. I think the only reason why I went more to the right side is because of the free speech thing, because I think pretty much everything. I'm more left leaning except the free speech thing that I'm more right leaning. It's insane. It shouldn't be a writer left thing. Well, it's insane. To me that's the left that's having a problem with free speech. That's what's insane to me because I always thought the left was all about free expression and intelligence and education and it used to be, it also used

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       to be more about peaceful behavior, like the hippies in the, you know, the seventies where everything really changed in the sixties, which really did launch a revolution and changed a lot of America during the sixties, in the seventies. And a lot of it is inspired by psychedelic drugs. Right? All those people, man, but nonviolent. That was a big part of that whole movement was all love, you know, and the hippies movement of today is not the same. It's like a feeble, small subset of the overall aggressive liberal group, you know, that thinks that, you know, they've got to stomp out sexism and racism and transphobia and all these things and like really aggressive front running, you know, the ones who want to change policy and change culture and change society. So when you get and teeth involved and you get people screaming in people's faces and people going to lectures and blocking lectures and threatening violence and like, wow, this is a very different kind of vibe. Then what changed the world in 67?

Speaker 1:          02:02:45       I used to have a bit about how the best way to deal with hate is with love and that I truly believed that if someone like w and I try to do that. Like it was weird when I was going through my weird face, but now whenever people say I fucking hate you because you did this, you did this. I tried to understand why they hate me to. And I generally do understand like I'm not a fucking idiot. So I know, okay. Yeah, I, I'm, I'm a guy that made fun of a disabled boy. I get, I get how you can hate that. But then I try, I try to, you know, instead of going, fuck you, I'm allowed doing this. I show them respect. I show them love. And then after like three minutes, they're always like, oh no. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I told you you shouldn't do that.

Speaker 1:          02:03:28       No, you shouldn't. I, it's so easy to change people's minds just by listening to people. Some. No, it's, it's also probably as like, these people don't know you. They're just engaging with you to get a reaction out of people. One, it's not just some people are what is some people, but most people, if you're one on one in real life on, on the Internet, on facebook, on twitter, it's really hard to change how people think. But if you've talked to people and you realize, okay, this guy's not a month and this guy is not an asshole. Because whenever people want to like, like if, if, if you, some guy that doesn't like you on the Internet that goes, uh, Joe Rogan's a fucking asshole. If, if you met him, he wouldn't say that. And, and if he did think you were an asshole, he'd explained this is what I think. And then you'd talked to him and he'd be like, oh no, Joe Rogan's a good guy.

Speaker 4:          02:04:19       Listen, there's, there's definitely a limited amount that you could get through when you're expressing yourself on twitter, on instagram or something like that and people like to get reactions out of people so they want to get Mike Ward's goat, they're going to fuck with you and say mean shit to you, and they're doing it because they want to get a reaction and some of them don't even think of you as a and they also

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       think of you as an easy target because you did something mean and because you're a guy in the public eye and you're a professional comedian and maybe they hate their job and like, fuck this guy. Is he living his dream when I have to do the Shitty job? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a lot of it. So it's a Shitty, it's a Shitty, but b, you don't really know because the whole, the whole interaction sucks. Like he's wrong, you're wrong. Everybody's wrong. Though. The whole thing is stupid and interacting with people like that and going back and forth with them. I've done it before. It's stupid to do, but it's just a complete waste of energy. Did you get along shit, your last special? No, no shit, no fucking article from vegans, but then ms dot quoted because they totally took me out of context because they said he calls vegans dip shits.

Speaker 2:          02:05:32       That's not what I said. What I said was that the majority of Vegans I think are good people who are just trying to live their lives without something dying. They just made this moral choice and then I say, and those people pay for it with their health. They're always sick. Fuck up. He looked like what the other job, the other part of the job. The other part of the joke was he used to like the other part of the joke was I'm in the rest of the people that are Vegan there really only vegan because scientology didn't find them first. I go there, fucking dip shits. They coulda woulda joined the Taliban if they took the wrong exit. It's just so the took out. He calls vegans dip shits. No, no, that's not what I said, but that's the title of the article. That's the only thing that I feel like you're special.

Speaker 2:          02:06:23       I'm sure there's other things to thing about vegans. I spent like four hours looking at pictures of people that have vacant cats. That was like when when like I don't eat meat or I don't eat meat product, but my dogs I'm like, cats do because like why am I going to decide? Like I feel guilty if I eat steak, but my fucking dog doesn't care my dog. If I left my dog out of the house without me, he'd fucking kill everything, so why am I going to be like, no, no young man. You're going to eat carrots. I know dogs can be vegan without swallowing hina, but cats can't die like in a month and a half. Yeah. That's why I wrote that, but I didn't even know that people were that stupid, that they. They made their cats Vegan and then just looking at the pictures, there's something weird that like, I think all vegetarian and Vegans, if you look at animal cruelty, you're always sad. But when I was looking at Vegan cats, it made me laugh. I was like, what the fuck? It's so ridiculous, so stupid because it's such a fucking glaringly ridiculous proposition. Decide that a cat is no longer a carnivore. They all looked freddy mercury

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       the last month of his life. I don't know if Freddy Mercury was the last one. Is Google a Vegan. Cats need to see that

Speaker 4:          02:07:44       on his deathbed. I don't need to see it. I get it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:07:48       God Damn you made me feel like shit. That was a good joke. And I was like, Oh, I'm a bad person. I thought maybe there was a real photo going around.

Speaker 4:          02:07:57       Oh, the probably is that I've been through is. Yeah, it's um. I don't know, man. If you, if you can explain your comedy well today, you can still get away with a lot, but you just have to, you have to take a lot of time to craft your bits and you gotta think about what you're saying and how other people, not just whether or not it works because sometimes things work, but you're saying things like, oh, I could have got away with the same exact thought and I would've been. I would've been in more people's brains. It would have gotten in smoother.

Speaker 1:          02:08:29       I did, uh, the, I heard a thing, I love Norm Mcdonald. Look, Norm Macdonald's, my favorite comic of all time. And He, when I was going through my thing, I saw a thing about him that he said that when he was doing weekend update, he'd done a joke about someone that had just died and then he got an email from the, the, the people's family about her. It was before email. So I guess he got a letter of facts or whatever about the, how they felt about that joke. And he was like, that made me realize that, oh shit, when I make fun of someone, there's an actual person behind that joke. There's. And that, what it, it's weird that my, my whole court thing, uh, like, like when I was, this was before I went to court, I read norms thing and I was like, oh fuck, I never got that because I was doing jokes about this. This kid was famous. So in my mind it was like making fun of Justin Bieber was like making fun of whoever, whoever. But then I realized, Oh fuck, there's, there's someone behind, you know, someone that feels

Speaker 4:          02:09:33       what you're saying is exactly what people experience when they hate on you online. Yeah. Oh, it's exactly the same thing. They don't think of you as being a person just the same way. You don't think of Justin Bieber as being a person. Exactly. It's the same thing. Exactly. Yeah. We're all guilty of it. I think. I mean, I hope ultimately we were going to get past this. I think a lot of what's happening with this is that this has only been around for like 20 years, this internet way of communicating with, with each other and only been around the way it is really the way it is now for like less than 10. Yeah. You know, and I think that we don't know what we're doing with it yet. We don't know how to do it yet and we fuck it up.

Speaker 1:          02:10:15       And I think too, like for comedy for a while when I was going through my thing, everyone is telling me they're like, do you think this is the death of like dark humor? And, and I don't think it is, but I think we're gonna just be smarter about, no, you gotta get the fuck out of Canada.

Speaker 4:          02:10:30       But also, I mean this is what everybody always. This is the end.

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       This is the end of this. I mean that was one of the things that I read about the Nanette special. This is the end of comedy. Like she was gonna kill comment. Like you never going to be at the end there, but it's so silly. Like why would someone not want to laugh? It doesn't mean that it's not a good piece of art, but why would someone not want to laugh? I then there was another weird thing that she got interviewed and she said that she was going to retire unless Louis ck comes back and he does. He comes back, he comes back, she realized, she said work is not done yet. Oh God. I don't know if that's a real quote that. But she might've been tongue and cheek. But here's the thing, right? Like you, you, you say things to. And I do. She might've very well just kidding. She might've been joking around like they might've been laughing, she might've been done. I guess my work is not done, you know, but then you see it flash in two dimensions and who knows? I think I was angry at her because she didn't. She said she didn't know who norm Mcdonald was like, fuck you. You know who norm Macdonald. Maybe she doesn't. Maybe she really isn't in the comedy. I mean she's not from around here. Even those, those people in that country that left Africa, they know who norm McDonald's. Mcdonald's is a fucking genius. Was on that boat growing coconuts.

Speaker 2:          02:11:56       I don't know man. Don't norms. Definitely a genius. I missed the. I can't get a human.

Speaker 4:          02:12:01       Must be on the podcast and someone could put the Kibosh on him talking to people anymore. She mentioned Louis C k again and possibly that he might mount a comeback. I don't want to stop him. She said it's worth just to see if he does have an audience. Of course you will. There was 18 seconds left. The interview tape. It didn't expect to take a turn. Ms Dot Gatsby of course had other ideas. If he does have an audience, then I won't be quoting standup. Ms Dot Gatsby said, quote me on that. If Louis ck finds his audience, I will definitely not quit standup because my work here is not done. Okay. But then also, could you say, say I said that with a cheeky smile. She added and left them.

Speaker 2:          02:12:40       Oh, so she was. She was fucking around. Why does the New York Times still use tape to record? I don't know, but I liked that she said that. Say that I said it with a cheeky smile. So good. Like a little joke as we suspected she was tongue in cheek, like literally she sang cheeky smile. So that's exactly what tongue and cheek means. The same thing. Yeah. So good for her. Yeah, man. The shade do anything wrong. It's not stealing. Who Cares? Anything transcribed can look fucked up. Her Act, all of it. Like the animosity, the fucking tension. Who cares so unnecessary. I have a couple of friends because they're there. A lot of Canadian comics by say by saying that, I mean against her. That's what I mean. I don't mean like her animosity towards anybody else, a Canadian comics generally they used to come here to the states, but like 10 years ago they start going to England or Australia and I, a lot of Canadian comics that knew her and they were like, she used to be really funny and I think it was just this show. There was like a more serious show. So maybe in the interviews she just fucking around pretending like she doesn't know, nor could be. This is what she wants to do now to, you know, just because you're really funny for a long time. I mean, I think that is something that I'm the fuck is her name. Someone is doing that now too. She just did something where she, she did an interview about it

Speaker 5:          02:14:00       that God dammit fuck is her name.

Speaker 2:          02:14:06       I got woken up real early this morning. I'm super foggy. My kid climbed into bed this morning at 5:00 AM, they're going to go back to sleep. She was, um, she's a constant. She's a regular on the Howard stern show. She used to be really big. She lost a lot of weight. Got Her stomach stapled. Very funny.

Speaker 2:          02:14:22       So is she called the scholarship? The Queen of mean uh, um, the, she used to do the and Lisa. So Lisa Lampanelli is not doing standup anymore because she's tired of hurting people's feelings and she's going to tell stories now. Yeah, she loves him. Kind of shared or talk about it. She loves. So she, she, she changed what she does, which is fine. Like you should be allowed to change what you do is it always made me feel bad about my reaction, my reaction to that with like, fuck. And then what you said. So right. That was like, fuck. All my reactions are always. Well, here's the thing, he thinks about it. You got and you have a brain. You gotta know who the real enemies are. Otherwise you'll waste all your venom on the fake ones. You don't want to want to save your venom for the real, real entities so that everybody else you could make the like this.

Speaker 2:          02:15:15       You could make peace with it. You don't need this. There she is. Bam. Storyteller. So she called her. What does it say? Shrink that shit down. So I can read her heading sugar down storyteller. Yeah, there it is. Workshop leader inspiration to millions. Well he got a little crazy there. I think she's just gone crazy. Yeah. She might be gone. He's lost her fucking mind. Or She's enjoying herself. Free expression. She got a lot of fans and she's happy. Anson just wearing a hoodie. I don't want to hear that, but she looks very different. It's strange. It's called Pilsen biomat. The pharmaceutical. Different book she's doing. Yeah. She's not been fun, man. Good for her. Good start on her show and a storyteller show. It's hilarious. I don't think it's going to be that different to what she used to do because you know, people evolve, people change and that's normal. Like there's nothing sadder than seeing a comic you saw 20 years ago and then you see them again this year and it's the same fucking shit. So it's good that she have the same act. Really Sad. That's really sad. Sealer guy from like the nineties. It's still around and they haven't. They literally have written a joke. Yeah, there's. Those guys are real. All right. We see them guys are scary. There was some

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       land over these last night, the journal Roast battle before there was a Jeremiah Watkins did a thing about ads comic that it was the best. It was so funny. It was his thing on the Internet that were were when you did a killed Tony that he comes out as. You think he's a funny dude

Speaker 3:          02:16:51       tonight that stand up on the spot. She. Okay. Oh, it's him. It's his show. Yeah. He used to call it thunderpussy for a little while. I don't know why. I think that was Brian. I think Brian decided to call it thunderpussy. Voted on name. I believe better name. Democracy should stick with that name. That's what thunderpussy is a way better name. Stand up on the spot. You're so literal, you know, but the problem with Thunderpussy is people might not know what it is, but if they should, why don't they know. I'll figure it out. Two hundred plus posts is the way to do it. Yeah. Jeremiah listened to me during my vendor pussy. Yeah. He should bring thunderpussy back. Yeah. What is this name? Stand up on the spot branding side. How about call it standup comedy right on the spot? No, no, no. Stand up on the spot stand. Standup comedy right on the spot right now. That's the name of the title. No, thunderpussy. Bam. We're done here. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:17:45       But he did do a good impression. We know guys like that who are these comics, didn't even, etc. It's just, I don't want to call them comics. It's just been the same thing for 20 years and they're open microbes for 20 years almost right in the go around doing maybe an opening spot somewhere and it's the same act, so they'll have references In there of stores that don't exist anymore and it's so weird when you watched them do it, you're like, well what am I is this is a train wreck? Is this sadness weekend for those in, in smaller markets, like montreal is a fairly small market on the english side because there's so many french people and even like the end, there's no money to be made in Canada. So there are a lot of [inaudible] hacks and comics and in montreal it's a comedy.

Speaker 1:          02:18:29       Works stIll around. It burned down like a couple months ago. An amazing club that was down. Yeah, that would have been. It was suspicious apparently. I don't know the details, but from what I understand, they're going to rebuild the building. They're going to break its legs. Hopefully they're jimbo fucking took off. Jimbo. Uh, he, he, he, he sold it. His mom died and then he sold it or he just closed it down. He, he, yeah, he closed it down than someone reopened it a few months later under the same name. A couple of people that bought it that love the club and they reopened it up until when it burned down. And do you remember ian? He was, the bartender said ian got a partner. He opened it up. And jimbo. Jimbo was such a good guy. Fucking love jumbo, but he closed that club like a fucking piece of garbage. He didn't tell anyone. He didn't tell his staff. He just fucking. They showed up one night and they were like, okay. Oh, the club fucking, everything's taken out of the club. He just left.

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       Yeah, it must have been drunk. Yeah. Because you, you use the. I remember the first time I saw you was there? Yeah. I used to do all the time. And you were like, and this wasn't like in fucking like 1984 or whatever. I'm started going back that late. But uh, you were, you were, you were doing like big, big, big, big, big fucking rooms, but you were there just to do a show for, you know, for the clubs. Work for jimbo forever. So I'd come back and work for free. Uh, did, did a weekend for him for free once I just said, just pay for my hotel. I go, let's just have some fun. I just, I just always loved being. He's just, he was such a great guy. I'm sure. Sure he's alive if he hears this still us. But he's a great guy and I just enjoyed being around him and I was a struggle.

Speaker 4:          02:20:16       There was a small room, it didn't have that many seats and he had two floors in a nice little bar downstairs and a pool table. Then upstairs real intimate room. it was just a great place. And to me it was um, it, that place helped me. It was um, in the time when I started doing it was right when my career went from being like a middle act who was kind of going on the road and doing these weird little gigs to becoming a headlight or getting on television. All that happened. A lot of it happened while I knew him and during that time. And so I've taken quite a few trips up to montreal for the comedy festival to work at jimbos place and she'd go back and forth and do a bunch of gigs up there. It just was a, it was an important spot for me, you know, like jimbo was one of those guys that he had a real eye for.

Speaker 4:          02:21:04       Like he, he booked everyone before they were famous. This is for people listening. This is like a 85, maybe 90 seat room, like it's super small. Yeah, probably. Maybe. Maybe it stopped 100 maybe, but he could have dumped him in there, but he never asked. Saw richard? Jenny there, dude. Yeah. Did you ever see jenny there? I saw chris rock there. I saw ray romano there guys. I saw chris rock there as well. Um, I saw richard. Jenny wants just level that place. It was during a time where I was um, I might've been like four years into comedy. I was, I was pretty new in the comedy and I was up there with you during the festival. You were just there? I was doing the festival. Okay. Yeah. Maybe I'll add maybe five years, maybe was five years into comedy and uh, richard jenny was a monster man.

Speaker 4:          02:21:57       He, he is the one guy that I just repeat this over and over again because I don't think people appreciate how fucking funny he was because he was, he was kind of an odd guy who was just, it was hard to find like a category where you fit it in. But he was so fucking funny and he just lit that place on fire and I remember leaving his set going, god damn, it was terrible, terrible. But I absorbed something from it and one thing was that that guy exhausted subjects like he would take a premise and exhausts that premise and smash it to the point where when he was on like this third wave of observation and punchlines, you would just like, you were in awe of the fact that he was continuing to beat down the subject as you were the writing and the punchlines. It was also like the mastery, his ability just master a premise and just just, just dominate all the and take you off guard, catch you off guard. But you also agreed while he was saying it, he was a wizard man. I mean it's just sweet tight jokes, man. He was so god damn good.

Speaker 1:          02:23:07       That's how I am with ralphie may. Like when I remember ralphie up, I've never seen anyone get laughs. Like ralph, he got like, he, I get a series of shows with them like a year or two before he died. And the, the walls felt like they were fucking shaking like I could I go, like I was hosting the show and he was, he was closing it and he wasn't supposed to close at first. But then he, he was like, it was gone too good. They, they had to make them close closing. Before that, it was a, I forget who it was. There was a, I forget who was in America. Uh, no, this was in montreal. The nasty show at just for laughs. I forget if it was jimmy carr or it was a brad williams one or the other, but they, the end, whoever it was, whether it was brad or, or jimmy said the first night they were like, he should fucking clothes. Like he's got a close and every night I go in the room just to feel the energy of that room. And since I'm from like, like I've been living in montreal for 20 years. I know that fucking room. I've seen like marilyn manson in that real club soda. No, it's a metropolis. Like I've been in that room. Yeah. I didn't ready room and that. And if felt like the fucking walls were shaking, it felt like the way when you were describing the earthquake, that's how fucking ralphie

Speaker 4:          02:24:31       seen diaz kill. Here's enjoyed ideas. Kill. I've never, I've never been seen joey life. Oh dude. How long you in town for a. We're leaving tomorrow. Well, if joey goes up tonight at the store, I don't know if he's up. That was a life changing thing. He's the funniest guy I've ever seen. Yeah. I've never seen anybody killed. Harder than joey diaz. Never have to see it. Okay. If you think. I mean ralph, he was a funny guy. Joey diaz is a force of nature. It's a different thing. This is not taking anything away from ralphie round. Ralphie, I'll fuck you up. Joe rogan. Jody. Jody is a different thing, man. He'll, he'll make you just go, whoa. What? Cocaine. That's comedy too. Shit.

Speaker 1:          02:25:12       I fucking love listening. Joe. Like I've never met him. But I love listening to him. He sounds like he sounds like him. That's what I loved about when I met him the

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       first time. I was like, you sound like a, like an old gangster. Like you sound like, I love guys that sound like they should be in fellas. Yeah, he definitely sounds like that. Yeah. Well he's, he's legitimately seen more life and more chaos than probably any random thousand people. Yeah. He's got great stories. New stories, man. He brings up new. I've known the guy forever and I'll have them on the podcast, you know, every few months. And he has a new store. I'm like, how the fuck is this possible man? And he's not a liar. People are making sure doors. No, he doesn't. I've met people. They verify the stories. He just lived a fucking insane life, you know. And you can tell when people make up their stories. Fuck, he's not a bullshitter. Yeah, no, no, he's not. He's hilarious though. It's um, you know, it's beautiful job, man.

Speaker 2:          02:26:15       We get lucky. Get to meet some really fascinating people. We do. Yeah. So when did you guys start doing this show and compound media? We started doing it about a year ago and we started doing the free show about four months ago because we like, um, we want to get people to listen to the compound media. How does compound media work? Because compliment media, you need to be a subscriber to the whole. The whole net were much. Does it cost? It costs eight 95, eight $95 a month. Us and good. How many shows you get a anthony kumi show up monday to thursday. You get in hot water. That's an amazing show. It's a ehrenberg gino biscotti. Four days a week. You get about like 30 or 40 shows. Yeah, there's quite a few shows. I met one of the hosts shoes on. Well, joanna. Yeah. So it was, yeah, she was on morning with bill schultz.

Speaker 2:          02:27:05       Joanna, she's the one. She's the, she's the only female hosts that we have on the network. This is his new book yet this is um, this, uh, there's something amazing, better anthony columbia. Like he, like, uh, in the old days with opie and anthony, he was like, he helped out a bunch of young comics and he's trying to, I think that that's kind of what he's doing with compound media and I'm calling myself a young comic even though I'm a young 45 and I'm going to die in four months. But well, you mean people that are unestablished young comics? Yeah. Yeah. It takes people that are established but funny. And he said he started doing things like, like I'm, I'm still based out of montreal and we were the only show that all the shows, they do them in his studio in manhattan. And then he, uh, he asked me, do you want to do this?

Speaker 2:          02:27:51       And I didn't want to move to like go. I got my wife, I got my life in montreal. I like montreal. So I was like, no, I'm going to montreal. But then he was like, do it. If you do the show, you can do it from montreal. And plus I, I. How'd you do it? How do you have it set up? We have a studio in a, in a, in a, like a, a park acts which is a neighborhood with where he's from. I don't tell people where you are, bro. They're going to attack us. So he said, but he has a studio and it, we do this show every week and it's, it's a lot of fun. Cool. So you just do, they downloaded, do you send it, upload it to send it to them? It doesn't stream, live, not. We were the only show that isn't live and we never pretended like advantage of that.

Speaker 2:          02:28:40       And do like weird splices where you go back in time and change clothes. Don't say a word about it. Well fuck is happening here. Just change your tee shirt because I just saw this gentlemen just shows 100 percent law. That should be your joke call. You should call your show 100 percent live. I think the thing that people like because all of our fans are like old, uh oh. And a fence. And I think what people like is our show is not political at all. And the like, a lot of the stuff on competent media is, is political and like people that, like politico, even people that like political stuff after awhile they're like, okay, I get it, I get it. Hillary's a cunt. Can we laugh? And that is both. The compound media is like very right wing, right? There's no. Is there any left wing like reno in the background?

Speaker 2:          02:29:32       Yeah, we should get, we should get it like a trends third mic hold trans show. Yeah. No, no, but it's not as right wing as people think it is. Well, you know anthony's right wing, but he's intelligent. He's good, sensible arguments whether you agree with them or not, you know, I'm not necessarily right wing at all. And uh, I liked talking to him and he's super funny. That's one thing that people, it's almost like in 2018 people have forgotten like what? And I see this on the right. Two people on the left field. Shit on anthony or people on the right. Oh shit. On like a. I like comics and I'll be like, that's funny. That's funny. Like even if that's not how you think. That's funny, right? Like sarah silverman, a lot of people on the right. Shit on sarah silverman. Sarah silverman is fucking funny. She's hilarious.

Speaker 2:          02:30:24       Very funny. Common. But you know what man, they only with their shitting on. There's only her political opinions. It's just, it's a nonsense war to get into, you know, do you do what do you want everybody to think to what you think, you know? And again, it goes back to what we're talking about earlier, people just get on these teams and they want to hate everybody's on the team and she's on team left, so fuck that bitch. And that's what happens. That's probably the why we got to the top of the food chain that we grew up together and a operation and then we just, okay, well it's us versus them, so we're going to win. Yeah. One hundred percent. Yeah. I'm william von hippel guy was on my show last week, wrote a book called the social leap. Yeah, I listened to that episode, but the book is essentially all about how human beings really succeeded by figuring out once we were some sort of weird primate thing that was close to us by banding together and working in cooperation and that, uh, forming teams and

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       loyalty to the teams always rewarded. I mean, this is what you're seeing in politics. You should see in social circles. Even when you know with these crazy auntie for people and, and proud boys. It's all the same thing. It's just tribal behavior. You're seeing tribal behavior on the right from the proud boys tribal behavior on the left from antifa and everybody else is the enemy and they lash out and you know, most of it is just completely misguided. Most of all the aggression and the violence and the hate is so stupid and so misguided and counterproductive and even though they think like, because in the moment it's such an impulsive, childish thing to do with a lash out and hit someone with a bike lock or punch someone sucker punch them, but you, all you're doing is feeding this fucking machine. It's never going to run out of fuel. It's just going to keep chewing up our, our culture. It's going to just keep going. It's your, you're not going to end it. You're not going to. If you start punching people, it keeps it. You're feeding the beast. Yeah, they're going to punch back. They're not going just going to punch back when they're going to kill you.

Speaker 1:          02:32:22       There's a thing. I used to do a lot of shows for, like, I'm uh, um, um, the people that liked me are generally men. Like most of my fans are more men than women. So I used to, whenever I do corporate gigs, the only corporate gigs I'd ever do, we're shows for military police officers or the hell's angels. And now every time. And the thing I realize is when you talk to a group of cops or you talk to a group of hell's angels, they're the same fucking guys, the same guys because they got the same exact fucking mentality through their group. The guys that are like, okay, it's us versus them. We do this. I, right bro, we're doing this, we're doing this. We're going in there and only difference is you can call the cops. No, come here. You just want to share.

Speaker 1:          02:33:08       Going to help me. Well, you're friends with him. You called a friend. I had a hotline. You can call it like motorcycles rumble up and take care of your problem. The I got into this uh, thing. Uh, about 15 years ago back home I did a joke about it. I did a joke on one of the galleries for, for the festival and uh, a reporter talk shit about me. And, and it was a joke. All my jokes are about little kids. So it was. No, it was a joke. I done a joke that I mentioned a little girl that got kidnapped in my joke. And the joke is good. Yeah. Fuck you always make me feel bad. I'm going to give up comedy. I fucking went out. Joe rogan to give up comedy. sorry. I should commit suicide. Me a hilarious joke about the little girl victim.

Speaker 1:          02:34:01       Go ahead a jump because it'd be a bit of vet the little girl, but it was a. And the joke is going to suck now because it wouldn't have to explain the joke, but it was a because I owed money to the government, the irs, the canadian irs, and uh, they seized all my accounts and I had this little story and uh, and that was the punchline was like, they're fucking crazy. If you owed them $8, they're going to kidnap your kids. They're the one that, they're the ones that have blah, blah, blah. And then name the little girl. And now I've got a, got a nice laugh. And then it ended, ended my set with a. I got a standing ovation and the gala got good reviews. Everything was good. Then like three weeks later, this reporter guy writes a, uh, an article about how the audience was shocked and offended.

Speaker 1:          02:34:49       And I was like, they were shocked and offended. I got a standing ovation and they were shocked and offended. And then there was this a french canadian guy that's like a, like a Larry King type guy. He started his show. He was like, Mike Ward made fun of this little girl, let's call her grandfather to see what he thinks about that joke. So he called the grandfather during the show, during the show. He didn't tell the guy who's so. He was like, hey, uh, do you know Mike Ward? And the guy was like, yeah, he made fun of a, your granddaughter and this girl fucking got kidnapped. Like he was like, well, what do you think about that? He was like, well, that's not cool. Yeah, no I have it isn't cool. And then people lost and then people were calling in, go like a fucking asshole. What a piece of garbage and then people.

Speaker 1:          02:35:35       So you've got an issue. People lost that. I like make them fun. The little kids, people lost their fucking minds and then people were sending messages to my manager that they knew where I lived. They were going to murder me. And then I look outside the house and my manager calls me. He's like, there are people that are going to kill you. And I was like, they're not going to kill me. I look at my house. I see fucking people lined up outside of my house. I'm like, oh fuck, I'm gonna get murdered. But lIke I was looking at them and they weren't attacking the house. They were just like in front of my house looking at my house and I was, I'm not a brave dude. Like I can't, like, like I'm not fucking you, like I don't know how to fight. So, but I was like, I'm just going to go talk to them to see what the, what the fuck's up.

Speaker 1:          02:36:16       So I went out and then they acted like they were just regular guys just hanging out outside my house. I was like, what the fuck? And then I found out like two or three years ago that I had done a couple shows for hell's angels and the hell's angels had parked. They told their dudes like Mike Ward, there are people that want to kill Mike Ward. So, so watch the people that want to kill Mike Ward. So the with the hell's angels, like on my house is in the middle of the street people, the other side of the street and on each corner that were hell's angels watching the people. I was like, fuck the hell's angels protected me. it's wacky. Yeah. A lot of hell's angels are probably good guys there. They're like, you're saying they're probably the same as the guys with the crops gang if you like. And this is the same with mafia guys. If you don't owe them money, they're good guys. They're good guys here with a message that's your business that's like,

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       they're all like, like whenever, whenever I meet anyone, like in the mafia or whatever, I'm like, that doesn't seem like he's in the mafia is a good guy, but I don't own like $19,000. Right, right. Yeah. Well i'M sure a lot of organized crime and a lot of organized business, they probably behave pretty similar. Yeah, because it's a business. Things they can get away with and things that they can't. Yeah, you can. If you just go around, go around breaking legs and killing pill you then they'll kill your kids. Goddamn business. Goddamn goddamn goddamn business. Alright gents. Let's wrap this pitch up. Doing this forever. Um, but uh, when do you think this thing's going to get resolved with the thing that's weird. Like when I went to court, this have fucking stupid I am. I thought it'd be like oj that at the end of my, my trial they'd be like case stand up and we go, we vote for you.

Speaker 2:          02:38:07       But in Canada they, we get the verdict like for six or eight months later. So I'm going back to court early january and then I'll probably get the verdict in a year or two. Like it's really like I'm going to be 97 by the timE I get the money is just cost costing you so far. It's going to cost me like, like I said, bruce from the like it's going to cost probably 200,000, 210 and this is the thing I want to start a. I just paid off 20. I could have paid off, I could have paid off 10 times if I wanted to, but here's the thing, what I want to do, I was really lucky that a, and I'm a guy that always sees the glass half full, but uh, I, I was lucky that I had the money to pay this because if I was a guy, like there was three or four years into comedy and someone sent me a letter to say, hey, you owe 80.

Speaker 2:          02:39:01       I would have fucking either committed suicide, quit comedy, or four years into comedy you'd probably be more inclined to say something inappropriate because you thought it was funny. Yeah, it'd be shocking. Yeah. Right. Like you get rewarded what, especially when you do open mic nights and you're just starting out, you get rewarded in taking chances that aren't necessarily Funny, but there are shocking. Yeah. You're risky because it might be the best reaction of your set. It's not. Might not even be necessarily good, but it's the best reaction of your set because frankly your set is mostly dog shit, right when you're two or three years in. Right? Yeah. So imagine that gets on the internet some three year old comic is barely stage legs under him dropping bombs. Just saying something stupid that you think you're going to be funny. Yeah, I'd want to. I want to start a thing though. I haven't started yet because I was gone through the depression. I've been talking about this for years, but now since I'm not in my depression I'm going to start a fund for whoever the next guy or next girl, next woman is going to go broke so they're going to be a storm of them. But I think because uh, because uh, like, like I was lucky I think of myself as lucky for real cause like I don't have a lot

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       of money but I had enough money to defend myself and I didn't even have to go like, ah, fuck it in any way. Raise your profile to help you. It would have helped me if I didn't spend all my days in the bathtub crying, drinking wine. Like, like if, if I had used this, I could've, I could've. I don't know if I would have become like super famous, but I could have used this, but I was like, I didn't, I didn't want to use this. I didn't want to be. I didn't want to be the guy that made fun of disabled children

Speaker 4:          02:40:44       too late. I don't know. yeah, I get it, man. I mean, I think that's a real noble idea to, to, to start a fund for the next guy and especially because Canada has such a wonky system. Canada, you're, you're basically conneCted. We're all together. We were. You guys were right here. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:41:05       Basically Vermont with crazy last 11 human rights commissions because there's the canadian human rights commission and every canadian province has their human rights commission and there in the world there are 12 human rights commission, so there's the one at the hague that they go after evil war criminals and shit and then they're a leaven in Canada that go after open milkers and Jordan Peterson and they go after me. I think

Speaker 4:          02:41:32       thiS is. We can make comparisons to what they're doing with free speech to what we deem to be the real issues with controlling free speech on the internet. I think there's real similarities. I think having these human rights councils, committees, people getting together and decide and they don't want to come off callous or ruthless or you know, and so they can decide, well that's gone too far. This is wrong. You shouldn't be able to say that. That is the number one problem with controlling free speech. Like you should be able to say whatever you want and then if people don't like you, then they'll watch you or they don't go see you and you let the free market decide. It's not about. We're not talking about inciting, hey are saying you should go kill people. One of the things that a lot of people had a problem with with gavin was gavin was actually saying punch them.

Speaker 4:          02:42:20       Hit them. That's fucking crazy because he's not used to being punched and hit. That's what it is. People that are around violence a lot, don't just willy nilly advocate violence, you know, and I think he realizes that's probably why he stepped down from this whole thing now because he realizes like, oh, it's probably hard to see how you're perceived when you're in that fucking polarizing a position as he is that he just was at one point in time. The guy who was one of the cofounders advice. It's really kind of weird, interesting provocate tour guys. Very smart. I enjoy talking to him, to this guy who's like, all right, and you know, the leader of a hate group. Like what? That shit sticks to you man. Yeah, I mean that's. It sticks to you like crazy glue. Yeah. I don't always going to do, but I think what we were saying earlier, it's like that perceptions, some sometimes

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       almost as important as reality and in your case may prove to be until wore off, right? Yeah. Like now I'm it people forgotten and people see the thing that, that, like I said, when we were starting out the podcast, the thing that kind of pissed me off is like in America, I like that. And in quebec, which is french Canada, they saw me as a guy that that would. I do jokes, but I'm, I'm offensive, I'm a fucking dirty comic and I do what I do and I think I do well. People enjoy that kind of comedy and they were. They enjoyed gangster rap the same way. They enjoy violent movies. I'm not like some shitty like fucking open mike are doing rape jokes that don't work. If I do rape jokes, my rape jokes, fucking murder, rape jokes, kill. Like I've won like fucking 15 awards.

Speaker 1:          02:44:04       Every rape, rape joke of the year award, but, but people, people like a lot of the media instead of going, there's something weird about the government because the government judging my case is exactly like judging a movie. It's like saying fucking why? Why are they driving so fast and fast and the furious why they forgot that what I do, even if you don't like what I do is art. Yeah, and you, you might not think standup is art, but it is, it's a fucking expression. And I were talking about this earlier that it just seems too much like you're just talking cause cause here's the thing. Whenever you see a comic that that's good, it looks easy and when it looks easy it looks like they just, it's off the top of their head and that's what they think. And that's a thing. I think it was jim jefferies that said this, that he said there are things that I think and there what I sound stage or things that I think are funny and that's what we do on stage. Like it. It's not a check. That was me too. Those are my specials are exactly the same. Probably you. All right. So jim jeffries.

Speaker 1:          02:45:16       But it's. Everybody says that he had a fucking good bit about vegan. Catsa was awesome. When can people watch your show? Oh they can see it. I'm on amazon prime in the us and uk. Uh, the stand up show. Yeah, it's called. It's called a Mike Ward. Infamous. And my first 15 minutes are about my court case. It's a really good special. I'm super happy with this special. It's the exact opposite of nanette. So amazon prime is amazon prime when lot of standup, right? It's like the retarded version of netflix. Where let you say retarded. Yeah, they let me say retired. I was on the phone right now. What did he say? So in three weeks I'm going to be on. I'm going to be on hulu. Yeah, very liberal. They have handmaid's tale. You're fucked. If not. We were a, were a friday, friday four to six

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       on compound media. Doesn't gavin's still have a show on like crt tv or some crtc crtv? Yeah. What is it still hasn't yet? He still has it. I, I've already talked to gavin in like over a year, like a. And the last time he wrote me he wrote a funny, like I thought it was. He wrote this weird fucking thing that I could tell that he was drunk and I was like, no way. He wrote me like a four in the morning, some fucking random thing and I was like, I'm happy to see you're drinking again. And then he wrote something, stopped drinking for awhile. He had stopped drinking for awhile and then he wrote something like almost insulting me and that I wrote, ha ha ha. And then he wrote a, you're too hard to. You're too hard to piss off. I'm going to write someone else.

Speaker 2:          02:46:55       So he was just, he was an a plus my, since my name is ward, like I was probably like at the end of the list, so he had to call some guy named. Some manco are going through all of his different fucking contexts, contexts. And that's funny. Yeah. All right gentlemen, thanks for being here, man. Fight. Thank you Canada. Get your goddamn shit together when it comes to freedom of expression. This is nonsense. You silly goose geese. Call the most amazing country. Other than that, so nice up. There it is. Fucking free speech in line. Alright, bye everybody.
