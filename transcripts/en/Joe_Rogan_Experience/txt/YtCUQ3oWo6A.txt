Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Lots of, lots of challenges growing up and then all of a sudden when I was actually away from all of the stuff that else familiar with people that were familiar with me with nice to be able to be in a setting where uh, I was actually excelling and achieving things anonymously, you know, there was things that were happening that all of a sudden I was shining in a way but not a, you know, none of my people back in the where I was from knew anything about it. But I was doing really well.

Speaker 2:          00:00:29       Discipline and resolve and doing any difficult endeavor is so important for a young man. You know, and this is one of the sort of themes we've brought up on this podcast many times is it, is there's no coming of age rituals in our culture anymore. And I always thought they were retarded when I was young. Like, you know, what are these fucking idiots hanging themselves by their tits and you know, or you know, putting their hands in the bullet ant bins. Like, what the fuck is wrong with these people? Why would they like, I'm 18. I'm a man. Done. No, no, really. You really need to go through something. You need to, you need to, you know, you need to have. That's why so many cultures have either a psychedelic experiences that young people go through or what we talked about this yesterday or deal poisons where it's, it's not a psychedelic because it's not in their area, so they take something that almost kills them and then when it's over, they're just so happy to be healthy again and alive.

Speaker 2:          00:01:20       And they sort of realized they've gone through a tunnel. They made it through a passage, they've, they've reached an actual new level and we're missing that man. We get out of fucking high school and then we're just lost. Were panicking completely terrified. We're going to starve to death. Is clinging onto the first job or the first opportunity for some sort of security that we can, you know, uh, the only good thing that I could ever think about having sort of some sort of a mandatory military experience for most United States citizens is to two fold. One, so people could understand what the fuck the military is really all about and of this nonsense, raw, raw chicken Hawk bullshit where people support this idea of sending our fucking trained killers to these places where we don't know anybody and fucking them up in the name of justice or whatever the fuck it is.

Speaker 2:          00:02:09       We would get a better idea of what that is. No, it'd be harder to pull the wool over people's eyes because it's so easy for all these people that will have nothing to do with shooting anybody ever to say we support the troops and support you are heroes and you're the reason why we can be free and nonsensical statements that mean the reason why that shit flies is because we got a nice blanket. This blanket of security, the USA, whatever the fuck it is, throw it over your head. You know, you don't really have to think about the actual horrors of military. If we forced people to join, and I'm not saying we should, but that the only benefit that we would get out of that as it people would kind of get an idea of what reality really is.

Speaker 1:          00:02:48       Yeah, I think it's a fine line you. There's no way to really kind of, to really be able to direct that experience. It's really as an individual and an individual thing, there's going to be people that figure out a way to make that work for them in terms of being lazy. Um, I got out of shape in the army when I got, when I went in because back when I sold the system, when they, when I went in, they uh, they wanted people in so they weren't really pushing people to heart and within a period of time when we didn't have a lot of obvious conflict going on, so it seemed like everything was sorted itself out and why am I going to the military other than just getting a college fund out of it and then it's fucking off. Uh, but, you know, so they were kind of like kind of lowered the standard a little bit to kind of get more people in. I think it was a mistake, but you know, I still learned a lot of. What year was this? This is from 80 to 85.

Speaker 2:          00:03:43       I came real close to joining an 85 when they got into high school, it was a, they had an army taekwondo team. They would, uh, you would get a Shitty, easy just job, but they would pay you to train and they give you a or they told you, fighting the train,

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       see what they did. The Bait and switch with me too, like, oh, you want to be a map maker? Oh, that's a great because you're an artist. Awesome. Let's bring it on down. Let's sign up and get you there. And then like you get on the bus and you drive all the way to Detroit and they get you there and they go, oh yeah, that one's full. That's the full. But you know what you can do, you can run out and catch bullets.

Speaker 2:          00:04:19       Yeah, I had a fucked a do that, competed on the national team, this guy bobby cleat, and it was out of the US army team. He was the one who was getting me to think about doing it. He always freaked me out because he was really religious and when I was 18 I was such a, a godless loser that I really. Religious people scared me. Like I was. The one thing I was scared of competing against was religious people. Like when I was, I wasn't scared of black people at first until I beat my first black guy and then it was a, it was religious people because I would see them sitting down like reading the Bible before they'd fight and I'm like, motherfucker, students get godness side. Like he's Kinda gotten us. I don't even fucking know what's in the Bible all. I went to Catholic school for one year.

Speaker 2:          00:05:02       All I could think of was this fucking guy's gonna have Jesus on his side. He's gonna kick my ass. But this Bobby Clayton Guy, every time he would fight, he would, he would sit down and read the Bible before we would go out there and he was on the U. S army team came real close to fall. That dude's footsteps. He was a couple of steps ahead of me and the tournament scene and I was looked up to him. So I was like, wow, maybe that's the move, maybe the army. And I looked back on it now and that, that, that weird feeling of indecision than I had when I got out of high school. It makes me so sympathetic, you know? And that's why whenever anybody tries to criticize the actual people that are over there, the actual troops, I'm like, man, that is crazy. You know?

Speaker 2:          00:05:41       Well they're there. They're the one that is actually pulling the trigger. Then the one like, man, you don't even know what kind of momentum is behind being a part of a machine like that. And being a 20 year old man or an 18 year old man and you know, and wanting to respect and admiration of your peers and you're fucking, your ceo is telling you whatever the guy is, the head guy is telling you that they'll give you an extra leave if you kill a guy with a knife. And have you ever seen those guys? The describing this, there was a video, I don't want anybody to look at it right now, but there's a video called American soldier throws away his metals. It's one of those, um, Iraq veterans against the war videos where this guy talks extremely candidly about his time in Iraq and killing civilians. And I mean, it's intense shit because, you know, this guy's not proud of this. And he's swallowing his words and he's talking incredibly honestly, but it's fucking his chief officer, whoever the fuck it was, the head guy told them they'd given four days leave. They killed a guy with a knife. So they had an extra incentive to kill a guy with a knife. And you're like, wow, America, fuck yeah. Fuck yeah, freedom. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:06:51       it's a, it's a, it's a, I think, you know, everybody in some way I think, I think you're right about trying to figure out a way that have some, some more perspective on, you know, just putting the situation, putting people in this situation where they have to kind of go through that for themselves and kind of discover your inner warrior in Michigan. That kind of becoming a person. I'm a male or female, just trying to figure out what that next step for you is separating from the nest and becoming your own person and you know, to uh, we can, we can talk around it all you want, but at the end of the day there are monsters in the world. Um, most of them are us in, you know, that's, that's what comes in, you know, we are, we have the capacity for amazing, wonderful things.

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       We have the capacity for some horrendous, awful things as well. And I think part of that having that warrior awakened in you is, is more about understanding the monster in you and understanding how to keep that at bay and understand how to keep that in check so that, you know, making it a global, global perspective. And I am in no way am I a hippie or you know, I'm delusional about like, we're not just going to have world peace someday. It's not, it's just not the case. You know, you hit the, we're going to be struggling with our inner monster forever. And some, you know, there are monsters that are just out more in areas. And the reality is we have to keep that in check.

Speaker 2:          00:08:24       Well, we lack any sort of a logical use guide for being a human. You know, we, we're essentially go on the experiences of people before us and occasionally we get wisdom. Like that poem that you read or that a excerpt that you read, which is genius and brilliant from a man who lived 200 years ago. Yeah. But you know, more than likely you get a fucking Moron for a dad who pump bullshit in your head until you're 18. Then you leave and you're like, these fucking niggers are trying to take jobs and like fucking kid. He's in. Here's a shovel. The job for you. Oh, you're quitting. There you go. It's, it's, it's a, it's a weird thing I've tried to hire your nephew is they keep morons, are allowed to raise more and you're allowed to homeschool them to you. Allow it to sit them down and teach them the same idiotic nonsense that you learned and keep the same pattern of fear and ignorance going.

Speaker 2:          00:09:23       It's, it's very strange. It's very. And there's no way to cure that either. I mean, who is any man to tell any other man in until we have some really incredibly sophisticated ways of measuring convenance that are just rock solid. And uh, you know, like, like a litmus liquor. I'd used to do a joke in my act about if you could find out if you were an idiot, as easy as he could find out if you're pregnant, you just go and lick something and look at and go, I'm a fucking idiot. There's no way this is broken. You throw it away. There'd be a pile of idiot detectors up to the fucking moon and you'd be like, bullshit. Fucking throw it down and grab another one until that happens. How do you say a man can't have a baby? How do you make, say a guy, you know, uh, can't raise a family and teach it.

Speaker 2:          00:10:03       It's on his own values. He can't. I think there's not going to want to get all 1984. But I think in terms of like say for example, health benefits, if the, if you go in to get some kind of, you know, something for your cold or your, you know, you're just basically sick now you know, your, your, your arm chopped off. Okay. That's, we understand that. But as far as just general health, if uh, if for some reason you go in for that kind of general health stuff and they just, I think they should be able to run your credit card statement to see if you'd been to Mcdonald's lately. You've been at Mcdonald's, you know, drinking coca cola or eating the candies are hitting, hitting the, hitting the fast food. It's like, no, no, you don't get anything. I've had this idea for a long times that the way to strengthen America is really to make less losers.

Speaker 2:          00:10:49       So anytime there's any sort of a situation like that, there should be some resources dedicated to pulling people out of that in a, in a, in a really enthusiastic way. The same way this research is dedicated to rebuilding Iraq after we blow it up. I mean there should be a way to like let people know the infrastructure of America needs to be rebuilt to that infrastructure of humanity. The infrastructure in the age of information with all the, all the stuff that we know about what it, what, what's important about being a human being. We shouldn't invest some resources into that and developing human beings in that way and if you're going to provide them with free healthcare, should also provide them with some sort of an education and some sort of a, some actually acceptable form where they're going to really absorb it of the fuck you're doing to your body stupid and taxpayers shouldn't be paying for this. And you know, we might have to put you in a state where everybody eats big macs for magic force you into some place. You know, you're gonna, you're gonna have to move to South Dakota because that's the big Mac state. You want to keep eating big macs. All right, well you can still be on the government nipple. I was writing a at one point, but

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       that was kind of like that where it was some detective and he starts realizing that there's some people just keep disappearing and you know, it's kind of a missing persons case and that kind of turns into like a lot of missing people. And he started kind of looking over, you know, kind of put the board up. They got their faces up there and realize all these people that are really large and then all sudden it turned into this total saifai thing where it's like, actually the aliens have like kind of infiltrated the government. They've like engineered this and hear this. The corn products saw the syrup and they're basically like, the government's like, yeah, for, you know, for whatever technology will will take this and we'll feed our people this and the aliens are harvesting the fat people put in their rocket ships to

Speaker 2:          00:12:33       tailor our, their rocket ships like whale oil or fossil fuels. Like we'll just kind of harvesting why not orange people? We had this, uh, I said Rob Wolf yesterday, the author, author of the Paleo Solution, brilliant, brilliant guy, but what he was talking about government subsidies and corn and the reason why there's so much corn out there and corn syrup and it's used in so many different things and it's so terrible for you. And it's like. And it's not even economically feasible. He's like, the government is actually paying these people to grow this shit because there's not a lot of profit. And growing it like somehow or another, some hustle has bitten, been put into place and the direct result of it is a billion fat fucks and its harvest. It's amazing they're coming, they're going to suck us up, they're going to put us in a fucking engine. You know, the twist would be,

Speaker 1:          00:13:15       you know, like all of a sudden there's a very large family and they're not being harvested like what's going on? It's like, well it's just, they're genetically. That's their, that's their genetics they had, they, they haven't been fed the corn syrup, so they're, they're just being passed over. So it has nothing to do with actual, like large people. It has to do with people that are specifically like gorging on the corn syrup.

Speaker 2:          00:13:36       Well, if we really do encounter alien life and that alien life actually eats biological matter, we're going to be fucked just the same way. Pigs are fucked. The same. Pigs are fucking smart man. I stopped eating pork for a couple of months once a couple of years. Actually, like a nightmare. It was pretty rough time. I saw my brother's keeper talk to you anymore. I know. Talk to you anymore. Have you ever seen the documentary? My brother's keeper. It's about these slow. They were slow. They had some sort of a mental retardation and they ran a farm and I'm. One of them was accused of a murder or something heinous and probably most likely been pinned on them because they were slow. Well, these guys running the farm, they went to kill a pig when they pulled out the shotgun, the shotgun and the pig is fucking running left and right. Trying to get away from this guy. It recognizing the gun and freaks out and filing. He gets out and shoots and I'm. I remember thinking, man, pinks are fucking so I can't be in pigs because you could shoot a cow in front of another cow and then the other cows barely react and be like, look, I don't, I don't have a problem with that, but I'm like, shooting that pig is kind of fucked. The aliens are going to treat us just like all due. Respect my, my boat.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       You know my, my pig brother, Bacon dude. Apparently the slow cooking method, robb wolf was explaining is the shit you're supposed to put a grill electric grill on 200 and cooker for two hours and the Bacon becomes insane. Yes. I'm not ready to commit to that. The crispy sounds great. I feel like an asshole. Like he said, it'd be like an incense. Almost. Your whole house would smell like bacon for two hours while it cooks. Yeah. That's a good way to become a fat fuck twitching, but if there are aliens and they are a million years more advanced than us, they're going to eat the shit out of our folk law for the stuffing ourselves with all this fast food and car and it's we're grain fed cattle. Cattle aren't supposed to eat grain near neither people and those are. That's what they had. They finished them on that shit. That's all nice and fat and juicy furniture finish him. Are you still working on a perfect circle at all? Are we ever going to see another album? Because I know for a while you were working on something and then it kind of dissolved into. I don't know even know what happened, but um, but you never know. There's always, there's always possibilities. My ex girlfriend had a perfect circle tattoo and I always had to look at it every time it was right on her butt. So every time I, I'm not very comfortable.

Speaker 3:          00:16:09       So let's go back to when the power went out, man. We were talking about Hicks. You guys put Hicks on, uh, you thanked him on a cd because you got ahold of one of his, uh, cassettes and you enjoyed it and, but you never, you guys never actually toured together. But you know, we closed, we planned on it. It was basically a plan. We were kind of setting into motion in like mid 93, uh, talking and that's when it's time when, when he came down and it was kind of part of why he was coming down. We're trying to figure out what we're going to do. Comedians and rock musicians like that. It's a, it's a weird combination of bobcat. Goldthwait did a lot of work with Nirvana. He opened up for them. We come in here and he told some hilarious stories about them just fucking and shit at him screaming at him and fucking murder in their eyes.

Speaker 3:          00:16:53       Fucking state. He's friends with them and they want him to go out there. It's like, yeah, like I, I actually approached, uh, David Cross a couple of years ago, hey man, we're going to do another. You. No, I would say no to. No, I wouldn't want to. Yeah. You don't want to eat dick in front of a rock crowd. Right? To with coins and stuff. It was all weird combination. It's like you're not providing them what they're there to see you. You've got to train me. Might work. I've seen guys do it and pull it off. And it works with. It works with pulsifer. Yeah, because it's just, it's just that the nature of that project, because it's, it's just that there's just all this different stuff going on. You've got film and you've got your video and you've got animation, you've got wheat for one to where we had neil hamburger opened up for us. Oh, that's awesome. You know. So that's just. And then in the middle of our study would come out and interrupt and go, I forgot a joke and then you know, just from the audience out for a minute and then wander off and that can take my drink and my chair

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       and sit down and like in my spot and take up space for western Europe. What was the song that you guys did where you filmed the video? Inside of a trailer? It's sort of a condition or conditions of my parole that's fucking song is great. Is that you're really your airstream. Is that your personal? So jealous. I want to buy one so bad at talking about getting one as a portable. A podcast studio. No, we should do, do that. And then come to people's towns and do. Because we could have a four G, four g connection for verizon. That's pretty Goddamn sporty. If we just find a place that can support the show, we would have to have a. We would have to have one for each show. Like we'd have to have a contract for each show because then we'd go over our data.

Speaker 2:          00:18:29       So it would have to get like 50 of them. We would have to get a sponsor. Will this team ting wants a sponsor of something new, some new rather cell phone company. Maybe they could do that. Oh, that's cool. So you, you, um, when you got into Hex for me, I was a young comedian living in Boston and I was working at the comedy connection. I had been doing it probably about a year, so it was probably like 1989. Would you live in Boston? I live in Newton. I live in Davis Square. How did you really? Oh, cool. I used to work at Boston pet center down on leach mere. Oh really? It's not there anymore. Nice. Some awful something there. Boston is a great place to grow up, but a terrible place to die. And I felt like I was dying there. Yeah. It's like the people are cool.

Speaker 2:          00:19:14       They're smart. It's interesting. It's cool. It's a real town, but it's too fucking cold. It's just too fucking old. I feel like it's, it's like I kind of feel like there's a parallel between San Francisco and Boston in a way. As far as that bitter cold. Let's take San Fran everyday son. I'll take San Fran all day. I like San Fran have maybe 100 times better than Boston, but I and I, I guess like, yeah, I'll take that. I just, I think the sand France had just changed their licensed places. Say you're doing it wrong. Yeah. You think they're doing it wrong. They just know what you're doing. No matter what you're doing, you're doing it wrong. They, they, they go over the deep end, but they go over my preferable and that goes. They go over the lefty deepen, which seems weird coming from like a cage fighting commentator type dude.

Speaker 2:          00:20:02       But I don't, you know, I, I like people that are kind and I think that even if the people on the left are doing it the wrong way and even if they're crazy and self righteous and pretentious, I think the idea behind it is they're trying to be as kind to as many groups of people you know and offer a commensurate environment for as many groups of people as possible. So I support that even though I think a lot of what they think is nonsense and it doesn't go along with human nature and behavior and Alpha them sometimes it grabbed their neck and shake them like a fucking child and we'll get it to go that bitch do some squats, have a fucking stake. You're, you're on planet Earth Bacon. Get up, bitch up. Have a fucking shot of whiskey. Let's do this. I just a Boston is just a, a Boston is liberal in the same way too, but just angry. Oh yeah, there's, there's definitely some. There was some Irish anger going on there and ugly cold. Yeah. I got really in trouble once I toured there and like it was like one of my first times back in Boston. It's like, back be back in Boston, dry capital

Speaker 3:          00:21:09       world. Crickets. Like no, as many fans as we were like, yeah, we're not, we're done there.

Speaker 2:          00:21:19       Capital of the world. It's hard to find a good one in Boston. And when you find a good, when you cling to them like a cork in the ocean, please keep me afloat, please. Um, I saw him at the comedy connection and uh, I saw him because he was on the Rodney Dangerfield special and uh, you know, I was an aspiring comedian. So I went to see everybody was on the Rodney dangerfield special when they came through town and Boston was one of those pit stops. It was like Chicago, Boston, you know, there was places where people would come through and you know, you would guarantee that they would be in your town eventually. And uh, Hicks went up, he went up at the comedy connection, or the first time I actually saw him was at Nick's comedy stop and he went up after this guy was incredible hack.

Speaker 2:          00:22:02       The guy was like cop donut jokes, cartoons, smoking pot and make them all the most hackneyed obvious premises. And he was killing audiences, filled idiots. Nobody knew who Hicks was. Me and maybe 50 other comedians in the back of the room at a 300 people who were in the audience places packed by 20 minutes into the show. Half the people have left, you know, I mean literally cleared out at least 50 percent by the end of it, it was maybe 100 people left and it was a 50 audience members in 50 comedians. And we. And he didn't give a fuck. He never came. I was, one joke would go wrong for me. I would go into a tailspin. I would panic, I would go, Duh. I would rush my jokes. I would say fuck too much. I would just, I would, I would not have any confidence. He's in the middle of this bit about how Satan fugs John Davidson, who don't remember John Davidson, was the host of. That's incredible. It was, was the, you know, one of them, it was like the Internet before there was the internet, so it's a demon with his thorny cock is fucking John Davidson in the ass and John Davidson swells up and the off season because he's pregnant with Lucifer's baby and he shits out Oprah Winfrey or, or Geraldo Rivera depending on where Hicks was at. And so hicks is standing onstage shitting. So he's pausing going,

Speaker 3:          00:23:30       I mean it's fucking minutes, 10 minutes of just just straining and people just getting up and leaving and he looks up in the middle of it goes. It's usually clears the room. We're

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       just flying in and I got to see him bomb horribly but yet still kill for 50 to 100 people. And then I got, I got him. You kill for the whole, the whole crowd. But what an interesting guy. It's like he was doing something that nobody else was doing. He was like, he was injecting Noam Chomsky and, and, and, and philosophy. And Terence Mckenna. And it was like, whoa. Like I didn't even like when I first saw Kennison kinison was the first time I ever thought I could do comedy. I was like, you know, I saw these guys rolling up their sleeves talking about did you ever notice? And it's like, well I kinda Kinda could do that. I guess I kind of could do that if I had to do that. But then I saw kinison and, and you know, fucking came and I was married and he was angry and it was funny and I was laughing.

Speaker 2:          00:24:38       I was like, maybe that maybe there's a comedy for me, maybe I could find my comedy. Right. And then when I saw him, so I was like, oh, this guy just flipped the whole fucking thing on its head. Like now it's now it's, you know, it's about formulating a philosophy on life and that there is a possibility outside of the direction that we're going in. And then it is possible for the human beings and the, you know, the, the human civilization to rise up and, and, and be about love and be about understanding. It'd be about intellectual curiosity and to be free of judgment. I was like, this guy's a fucking comedian. Like this is the craziest Shit I've ever seen. It's almost like his jokes were an afterthought to inject this philosophy into the audience.

Speaker 1:          00:25:24       I think partly. Yeah, absolutely. But I've loved. I, you know, I kind of like a spend a little. I spent all the time in that little comedy world for awhile, was very always very inspiring to me to watch comedians like him basically just stick to their guns and finish their ach without getting that nervous sweat. I mean, it was always inspiring to see that. And it's always my favorite comedy clubs to go to were the ones that, you know, you end up if you're sitting out front of, uh, the Mann's Chinese, they give you tickets to go to this free comedy club, go then because if it's a good comedian on, he can like take bets to see how quickly the room's going to clear. And we had a, I think I remember one time he had andy kindler did a whole thing where he brought everybody he knew down there to kind of have like a little, a side side seats with all the comedians that he had an abyss leave and they did a whole, like a debunking comedy, like a, like a hack hack a class and they had everybody come up and just do like the hack thing in front of this audience and this, all these people that just kind of one tickets from, you know, got tickets to the man saying isn't there just, I don't understand.

Speaker 1:          00:26:32       Like that's funny. Why is that hack? That's funny. And then, you know, that whole thing went on for like an hour, hour and a half. I was just, I'm in the back of the room, just peeing myself. Them go through this. And

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       then some dude gets out after them as their act and does everything that they just went through and the audience is like, oh that's so funny. Can I have another break? And then David Cross gets up and then just clears the room was awesome. Opening line, just, you know, I saw Schindler's list the other day, Schindler's list finally saw it. It's not that funny. This whole table of people just get up and out the door like, and it just, every joke that he said, it was like, we're watching like me just set off a bomb there. He just set off a bomb. They cleared the room. Was Crosses, rarely credited, but in my opinion of watching it all happen, he's the originator of the idea of alternative comedy because I saw him do an alternative comedy in 1988. He was in Boston and Cambridge. He would go up and he would do, I remember one time he was doing this, this, uh, exercise video where would teach you, teach you how to stretch.

Speaker 2:          00:27:39       So you've played the exercise. Video districts. I really do feel a stretch and he was like doing this like long and people like nervously giggling and not showing, were not sure where it was going and it never went anywhere. It never went anywhere. But it was amusing. I felt, I felt he was like a better version of what I'm Andy Kaufman was doing because Andy Kaufman would get up in front of like colleges and like read the great gatsby and I was like, well that's Kinda fucked. It's not really funny at all. Like this is kind of crazy. Like it is now. It is now. Yeah. It's like a delayed reaction to like witness it as great longterm absorption. But Cross was. He was funny while I was doing. It was, it was weird. He was just so silly. It was actually funny while he was doing it.

Speaker 2:          00:28:23       Do you like comedy? I like music because I'm completely unmusical. I don't have any skill. I don't have any talent. I don't have. I don't understand it. I don't see those bars. That might as well be Tibetan. You know, Sanskrit. I don't know what it is. So when I see someone perform music, when I, when I'm in awe, it's like, to me it's a beautiful, wonderful experience. Do you feel the same way about comedy because you don't do comedy? Do you watch comedy and just get a free sense of enjoyment that you might not get from watching something that you actually, I generally enjoy more scripted like a film comedy when I see a group of guys who have figured out not a formula, but there's just a, there's a rhythm to their comedy and they've actually created a character behind, you know, that actor brings something to the table that you want to look at.

Speaker 2:          00:29:14       And then their timing in this scenario where it's clearly there are just play acting. It's like, hey, we're just playing dress up pretend and you still laugh because the writing solid, but the, what they bring to the table with their writing is solid. So like, you know, when you're seeing things like, uh, the movie super troopers, it's just like, those guys had to have a lot of fun making that film because everything was just like, the writing was perfect. It's a quotable film. It's like every step of the way. It's every, every scene is quotable and they're having fun.

Speaker 1:          00:29:41       And then you see, you know, almost almost any will farrell brothers, those guys just. Yeah. Uh, John C dot reilly's, like just a master at just bringing his thing to the table and then making your script come alive. It's just a great. That to me is like, and I, and I look at that and I go, what the fuck did you do that? I have no idea how they did that and I have no idea how to be funny. I just saw I'm watching them just like nail these things out of the park. Like you could put all that script on the paper and show it to me and I would just go, which I don't have where to start. Like, you know, how is this funny?

Speaker 2:          00:30:13       One of my favorite all time Comedians is Mitch Hedberg and one of the reasons why Mitch is one of my favorites is because none of his stuff was funny on paper. It didn't make any sense. Like you would see that he goes, it was somebody asked me do I want a frozen banana? I said, no, but I want a regular banana later. So yes. Now if you saw that on paper and be like, why is that funny? What the fuck is, I might have butchered his joke. I don't think it was pretty close, but I, I love that. I love that he redefined comedy in a certain way to. Because he, he made, first of all, I was a heroin addict and he had only clean comedy. I mean his stuff was squeaky clean. Meanwhile he was gang green and his leg, because he was fucking shooting in this same vein too many times.

Speaker 2:          00:31:03       It was really a strange guy and his material was all so odd and if you loved Mitch Hedberg it was awesome. But like Mitch Hedberg would go on after these guys that would like sing and dance and do song parodies and you know, they would close with a rap and he would eat dick. He would eat dick so bad that the club owner would try to switch him with the Middle Act and say, listen, the Middle East has been doing stronger. We're going to have him close. We're going to give him your money. And then they're, you know, his manager would call it and it'd be like a big problem. And it wasn't necessarily that he was a not a, not a funny comic, it was like it was completely the wrong setup for his type of comedy. Whereas it's a delicate environment where you could take a guy like Kennis and it didn't matter who went on before him, when he stormed out of this fucking room has changed. The environment has changed. Hedberg would get up there with sunglasses on, you know, and it just goes, bear never played tennis against a wall. They're relentless. You would just start giggling and it would, it would be a slow build. And he was one of the rare guys that would have a nonsequitors. Everything was being nonsequitor every single bit. I'm sorry, what is that drawing on the wall? That's a vagina. That's what a child would draw like in high school maybe.

Speaker 1:          00:32:32       And in Walsh's a drawing of what he thinks Barbie looks like. And it's right next to Pam Anderson up.

Speaker 3:          00:32:41       We had an artist on one of our other podcasts to interrupt you, but I just kept screaming at me. This whole place is a giant distraction. Look, there's a flashlight right here. Are former sponsor fucking cats all over the table. Super Mario brothers behind the appointment. There's a mannequin tit stormtrooper helmet. Ron Paul's in here somewhere. Where's Ron? Ron? Paul's over there somewhere. She's leaving.

Speaker 2:          00:33:06       Yeah. Yeah. It's a. This is a weird little setup we have here. What is what? That fucking painting, man. That's what I've been wanting to ask.

Speaker 3:          00:33:13       Yours burned that thing. If you look far away, if you. If you look at it far away, it looks like a naked girl. Shit. Thanks Joe. Thanks a lot man. Appreciate it.

Speaker 2:          00:33:26       I only said that for humor. I really mean that. So I have. I have questions for you and it's a regarding Anderson Silva. I want to know what you think is coming next. So this, you're gonna. Are you on the inside of that? Is it a what's happening? Most likely it will be one of two things. Depending on what they can talk them into. Anderson is a very rare position where he sort of gets chooses opponents for the most part. It'll be there, you know, based on like he didn't want to fight Chael Sonnen because he talks so much shit. He didn't want to do it, but he also did because he wanted to silence them, so they just had a financially motivated them. It will most likely be either this kid, Chris Weidman, who's the best up and coming 195 pounds or one of the best. He hasn't fought a lot of guys, but he's a, I think I've heard about stamping.

Speaker 2:          00:34:18       Pretty solid dude. Just destroyed Mark Munoz who's also a top 10 contender. And the way he did it was just so just complete and total the way he anticipated all of his moves countered. I'm almost strangled them three or four times the first day. Pretty Young Kid, right? Yeah. And a spectacular wrestler. So it's him. He might get it, but he's, he's a bit of a tough sell because, uh, there's a lot of folks in the mainstream that don't know who he is. He's more of a, someone who he. He can beat Anderson Silva. I mean, look who the fuck knows what's gonna actually happen. But it may be possible that he could pull it off. He has the right set of skills, but he's not known as well. Um, but the other option is if George St Pierre Beats Carlos Condit. Okay then, then they have some fucking crazy Susan. Is that the guy that they mentioned at the end of the fight when they were saying so are you going to fight him?

Speaker 2:          00:35:11       And he went to find him. Oh No, that's John Jones. Okay. John's right. Yeah. You said he doesn't want to fight Jon Jones, but Jon Jones really isn't a totally different weight class. Not just Anderson has dabbled in the 205 pound weight class, but really he makes one 85 pretty easily. He doesn't have a problem making one 85 a and John Jones could never make one 85. John Jones is six foot three, 240 pounds to 30 least when he's walking around. And then he cuts down to two. Oh, five slowly, you know, over his camp. You know, cut. Probably cut my loses the last probably 10 pounds in water weight. He's just a way bigger guy. He's way bigger and he's a really strong wrestler and stylistically he's a nightmare and apparently they have a mutual admiration for each other. That's it can, it can be bypassed, you know, with the right amount of money and both guys probably agreed to it if the right amount of money on the table, but right now, you know, they both stated their admiration for each other and they're probably number one and number two, pound for pound fighters in the world right now.

Speaker 2:          00:36:09       People would like to see that. But honestly I think George St Pierre and Anderson are more physically the same size. It's closer. Okay. George has a struggle to make one 70 whereas Anderson is a, uh, he makes one 85 pretty easy. George could make one 85 and be the basically the same size and that would be an amazing fight that I think if, if George can get through Carlos condit and that they believe they're going to fight in the fall, depending on George's recovering from an acl surgery. Okay. So yeah. Yeah. I've had to. And if George gets through that and everything's cool that, uh, and if he beats Carlos Condit, which is an f, you know, Carlos has really good, he's a very tough. But if he beats him then they go to probably a Dallas stadium, probably doing that big giant fucking 60,000 square foot. That'd be awesome.

Speaker 2:          00:37:00       That'd be. I'm just looking forward to the next, you know, on the community with what happens next because I was, that was a pretty amazing Anderson's a, uh, he's a Ninja. I mean, he really is. He's a real master martial artists in a way that like what, what he does, there's maybe a, a tiny handful of human beings on the planet who can move the way he moves. And so I think going back to some of that, you know, that relaxed state we were talking about before, I just, it's really watching him, watching him operate. It's, it is like Jordan at his, at his top, top of his game. That's just the panther, this, this art, this ballet movement. Uh, just, just a fluid. Yeah. And a connected. Um, and I think a lot. I think a lot of that's just, it seemed like a lot of that's missing from the UFC these days right here.

Speaker 2:          00:37:50       Any mixed martial arts forum that seems to lead. There's that, you know, there's the awesome gladiator go, you know what to do is bang it out, but there's that art that I just kind of missed from the earlier days of watching it be the, that the bracket system where you had to kind of, you know, suck it up and get through three dudes in one night. You know, the old wrestling days. Well, what Anderson is, is so much better than everyone else that you get to see that art. Whereas like you see a couple of dudes that are really close to each other, go at it. You don't eat. They don't have that, that, that, that giant skill level above their opponent. Whereas Anderson does like when it comes to striking Anderson's, the most accurate fighter we've ever had inside the octagon. Like no one has been as accurate with him and he's, he's so, he's so fluid in the way he moves.

Speaker 2:          00:38:44       He does things and its opponents don't even realize he's done them until they land and you're like, what? He's like the master of like sneaking shit in. It's a really unusual dude and the reason why he's able to do that, as you know, mixed martial arts as a whole is really only been around since 1993 and we're seeing this constant evolution of it, but Anderson represents at right now what's possible the furthest, furthest evolution of the game as far as it's ever gone. But the reality is in his individual disciplines, he's not as good as the best guys. There are better kickboxers therapy, better Jujitsu guys like him and it's like one day we're going to see a guy who can do to Anderson Silva, what Anderson Silva could do details on it. I mean, we haven't seen it yet, but we're going to see a guy who has hixon Gracie Jujitsu and bought her rate type striking.

Speaker 2:          00:39:38       Right? You know, and when that happens, I mean the man and that's. It's inevitable. It's the sport is moving in that direction. It's like this constantly accelerating process and right now it's the only people that are successful are the completely fanatical and obsessed. You can't get by and sheer athleticism. You see some basketball players that they probably don't work out as hard as they could and you know, they maybe don't, but, but they're good enough to get by and they have enough gifts to get by in the pro basketball player, tall and arrogant. When you get to the, when you get to the top, the upper echelons of the ultimate fighting championship. There's no room for anybody but the fanatical. There's no room for anybody but the obsessed and the Rory Mcdonald's of the world, these young guys that are coming up that are just insanely good.

Speaker 2:          00:40:20       And every time you see them, they're much better than they were six months ago. That's the future. And that's one that's inspiring because it's, it's, uh, it's definitely that, that chess game that we spoke of earlier. I feel like it's more interesting to watch because although I don't have necessarily the frame of reference for what's actually happening, when you actually go back and look at the tape and go click by, click and go, oh my God, that's exactly what you're talking about, John and your corner just going this and this. It's, it's a chest moves and it's millimeters and with a guy like Anderson, there's no one to tell him to do that because he's that guy. You know? Anderson really doesn't have it. I mean, he has guys that coach him and Moitai and coach them in Jujitsu when it comes to mma and nobody always going to tell editors what to do and knows exactly what to do.

Speaker 2:          00:41:07       He's at the top of the mountain. It's beautiful to watch someone who's at the very best of the, the like the, the peak, the apex of whatever that is right now. You know, whether it's fucking motorcycle racing or whatever it is, gymnastics. When you see a guy who was at the, there's a quote from the movie vision quest. Did you ever see that movie? Matthew Modine? Remember that moving good fucking movie, man. Why are you laughing right now? Why am I laughing? That's a great. Because I forgot all about it. I haven't watched it lately though. In event held up, we should watch it now. We should list. What's the girl's name? The girl with the black hair. It was hot as fuck. I'm member. She moved into his house and he was caught smelling her panties. Sylvester stallone. Yes. I'm. Anyway, there's a scene in the movie where the guy is a google that now the kid is the top and you know, he's like one of the top wrestlers and he's about to face a state champion wrestler and is huge thing and he's blown away by it and he's working as a delivery man at a hotel is working as a room service guy and one of the cooks in the hotel and him have this conversation about the guy seeing a Palae or I think it was Paleo, but I've seen some incredible soccer game and seeing this guy do something that just for that one moment you.

Speaker 2:          00:42:24       You rejoiced in that guy's movements in his ability to do something astounding. And for one moment I like it. Raised the entire group of people that were watching it. For one moment we were above the apes were above. Right? The Shit chucking monkeys. You know Linda Florentina. Oh, she was so hot. Soon as ridiculous. Whatever happened to her sex change. She. Nelson. She. Yeah, she's awesome. She actually doesn't look that bad. Now you got to Google photo over. I mean for being a target semester. Ostalgie Candle Light One candle. Corner of the room. Don't see that much. Everybody's good. I apologize. Linda. You don't want to wrestle. Storm Susan Dogma. Weird. Weird that you even know who was in dog ma? Did you see dogma? Dogma? I win. Okay. Who doesn't even know? What's the, the old uh. Oh Man. I'm going to blow this. All right. So, uh, so has John Travolta Greece.

Speaker 2:          00:43:33       Oh yeah. Have you seen Greece? Yes, I watched it all the time. I have not seen that. Marine Greece. Did you reject it? I think it was one of those things you kind of went by and then all my friends were like, oh, we, you know, green screen, and I'm like, you know what? I've decided I'm never going to see that decision. The, the doors movie in Greece. Oh, the doors. Maybe movies. The season finale of lost was mine. I said, you haven't seen that one thing and then up to like the season finale, he decided not to, so he doesn't know. Why's, why's he got me enough? You made it hit me with enough nonsense books. Yeah. You were a wise man. What did you just bring up as an example? What was the other one? Doors, doors moving. I don't know, just one of those things. I just all of a sudden just didn't watch it right before val camera went to New Mexico and grew his head.

Speaker 2:          00:44:25       He became Jim Morrison for a little bit and his head apparently like on the set, he was like, so that he was like, you know, being Jim Morrison and did a great job of Jim Morrison thing. John Malcovich, the John Malcolm x play, Jim and the words of a Marlin Brando. Why don't you just try acting? Yeah, that's A. I love that he said that the whole idea of people talking and character. I read once that Angelina Jolie and Jon voight used to get on the phone and they would have full conversations father and daughter in character. And I was like, that's a crazy bitch. Okay. And she's broken. He's broken. He fucked up raising her. She's a mess now. I was talking to a friend of mine like a. We were somehow Jennifer Aniston came up and we kind of segwayed from Brad Pitt off into Angelina Jolie and we both were like, we kind of paused for my one.

Speaker 2:          00:45:20       Fuck Dude. How crazy is that? How, how like Brad just got to be kind of sitting there like, just kind of going. It's just for the press because this just like you say that, but I bet chief, fuck the shit out of him. I bet she sent him for a, uh, in a, in a sexual ride that Jennifer Aniston is completely incapable of. I bet she's way too self control, self conscious to controlled too, you know, too reserved. Angelina Jolie had billy Bob tattooed on her fucking arm. She fucked billy Bob Thornton, tattooed his name on her arm and then carried his blood in a vial around her neck that bitches loked out to Jo. Lee's got some big old. Hold that up. Pull that video up. You remember? That was a fucking great. That was a great science. That's just. And I think for some reason maybe I Lindsay Lohan. I don't care. I don't care what kind of bell rope she tugs. I just, I think the crazy just completely outweighs any of that. Just the drama that's attached to any of that stuff I think is just like not a part of my world. My friend Tony always said it best. He said psychotic and erotic are next door neighbors and they really. They're so close to each other. I could see that. And the craziest girls I've seen, the craziest girl I've ever dated was. This is Lindsay Lohan,

Speaker 4:          00:46:45       some big ass tin cups, cups. I'm trying to get in your ass Nigga. Sweating. Pennies can day. This is a different song now this is just remember the chorus which got some big ass. Today's it goes into it. I need to see them. Do you see this is a different version of man. I'm telling you this

Speaker 2:          00:47:45       different version because the other one was more sing silent. Angelina's Xiao Li gas on a big ass titties. It was like more rhythmic. I think these guys bit them big problem in the rap community from, in the comedy community, which brings me back to bill Hicks at. Uh, I didn't, uh, I was a big, huge fan of Denis leary for about six months until I saw Hicks and then I went, what the fuck? You guys doing the same jokes? Right?

Speaker 1:          00:48:09       But, and, and uh, and no disrespect to bill, but I think as you've probably seen mostly in that comedy world, uh, the, the beauty of Hicks was that, that was his world. He was staying in that world. This is, this is his whole purpose is to do this thing, right? Most people during their, during that period of time where there were, there had, it's like animals had their eye on the Johnny Carson Position, Oh yeah, do this and then you do this and you get to show and then you did this thing and you get to be Johnny Carson, somebody kind of like, uh, the subject of a shakes the clown and like watching everybody tried to be, you know, you know, being, you know, binkies trying to get that position and our shakes and all that and you know, but I feel like Larry was, you know, whatever you want to lay on him as far as like, you know, biting that style. It doesn't matter because as it went on, what he ended up doing with all of that, he ended up becoming. He making his own thing. So even though it kind of, maybe you know, it clearly just clearly carbon copied that. But in his defense I feel like, you know, back then it was war, you know, you're trying to make your make your way. And I think,

Speaker 2:          00:49:19       Eh, I don't give that. I don't give him that. It was really, he could have, he could have come up with his own shit.

Speaker 1:          00:49:24       Yeah. But I think, you know, I had the same problem with them for many years, but like, just let it go. I let it go because he's funny. Yeah. Some of those watching the rescue me, there's some, there's some tasty bits in that. In his movie he did A. Oh man. Where he was a burglar and he's stuck in this house. John Lovitz in him. Is that what it was? No Man. He could eat shit and spiderman then. Did you know he wasn't. He wasn't in spite of the suck and Spiderman is just stupid. Why is he in that movie?

Speaker 2:          00:49:56       Someone needs a dad. Like you couldn't just get anybody else. I'm not a fan when I find out you're full of shit. I'm sorry. Right? Yeah. I can appreciate that. He does well at some things, but until he comes clean about being full of shit in the first place, he can go fuck himself and it's not interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:50:12       Yeah. Not Interested. I'm going to get him and Bill Murray in the same room in a minute.

Speaker 2:          00:50:17       Do some correct. Is Two guys want to know where the three guys were, know where they were when they died. Rich, Jenny, because it was just so crazy. The Camille committed suicide, a Kennison because he was my first influence. And then Hicks. I was at this club in Connecticut, Hartford, Connecticut and me and this other comic. We're in the green room and this girl came in and goes, Bill Hicks just died.

Speaker 1:          00:50:39       We're like, whoa. He may die. He bit. Yeah, it was like overnight and I was in. I was in a hotel in Detroit or flying to Europe the next morning and uh, I woke up in the middle of the night, like just bolt upright at whatever time that was. I can remember at the time was. But like I basically was awake and then we got up the next morning and my pager beeper got a message from Dunkin is manager and it was like bill pass last night. And the time that was quoted he passed was when I woke up in bed and was pretty creepy.

Speaker 2:          00:51:18       Your stomach actually via wherever he was, through Detroit to tap me on his way. I was like, dude, I'm sorry to make you go to Detroit. It's probably a really quick trip when you're in hyperspace. It's probably right next door. He reached over and press found out about his.

Speaker 1:          00:51:35       I found out about his problem because I had an awful nightmare when we were. I was at a one of those kinds of motels where you get the you can pull your car right up to the outside and it was kind of like the two stories and you kind of walk through the breezeway between the thing. He's and there was like a hundred people there and everybody's bawling their eyes out and bill wasn't there and I was like, what the fuck is this dream about? So I called the. I called his manager the next day and I'm like, I had this fucked up dream about bill. And he goes, yeah, I can't really talk about it. And nobody, because nobody knew yet that he had pancreatic cancer. I had this fucked up dream and I called his manager and went, what the. I had this weird dream about bill, what's up? And he's like, yeah, I can't really talk about it. We're,

Speaker 2:          00:52:21       do you believe mean there's no way that was coincidental? No. No Way. No, no way. What is that? What's going on there? Yeah. Is there a zero, zero, zero dimension that is next door neighbor that you can tap into that I have no idea. Edix. Diarrhetics what the fuck is that? Yeah. I don't know, but it was, it was pretty

Speaker 1:          00:52:44       and I had a couple moments like that with him over that time. That's what I'm saying. Like when he died, like I was just, you know. Yeah, of course they woke up in the middle.

Speaker 2:          00:52:50       I never, I've never had anything like that happened to me, but I absolutely believe it's possible.

Speaker 1:          00:52:54       Well, yeah, it was a weird. It was a weird time.

Speaker 2:          00:52:57       They see the most provable form of any sort of psychic phenomenon is the ability to know when someone's looking at you, they said that statistically you can prove, you know, you can have people stand and have their back facing a group of people and they can statistically tell with, you know, certain amount of uncertainty, guesswork, but you could show on a graph that people can tell when people are looking at them, if that, if that is possible, valid than these other things. Definitely on some

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       level valid because it's energy.

Speaker 2:          00:53:28       Have you ever heard of the work of Rupert Sheldrake? He's this guy who believes in the morphogenetic field and he's, he's done research showing that dogs can tell when their owners are coming home. He believes there is some sort of a frequency that we're all tuning into that all of our consciousness connected to some type of grid and you can recognize when that's in motion and you can recognize things and events, things that are happening and it, it's just a matter of us being sensitive enough to tune it in, you know? And that's, um, I think that's really one of the weirdest things about being a human being. I'm like, no, no, no. He's not doing that. I don't think he is. He might be. I doubt if he does, he'll be okay. He's just a mess. He's from Ohio, you know, I rescued him from Columbus. Um, I, I want to believe that we're slowly but surely moving from the phase of grunts to language to written language to internet, to psychic ability to communication. I mean, I want to think that it's. But there's so much room for fuckery. There's so much room for fake psychics. Oh yeah. So when I hear a story like yours, like, ah Ha,

Speaker 1:          00:54:41       I have no reason to lie about that. It's not like it's going to make or break my career, you know? So what does sound cool? It sounds pretty cool. Pretty bitchy to bring up at a party, especially if you're in front of a fire. Touch me.

Speaker 2:          00:54:54       Yeah. Everybody wants to fucking claim psychic. Everybody wants to claim it. It's so hard.

Speaker 1:          00:54:59       Trust people, I don't take no shit. That's, I think, the, the problem with all of that is that we're not probably on some, you know, a universal level. We're not really allowed to completely be able to tap in and rely on it. Although I do firmly believed that each one of us has to kind of really listening to the, uh, the intuitive side of ourselves to kind of just follow your heart and know what path you're supposed to choose because we all kind of have a role to play at second and you kind of have to find that happy medium between like making yourself happy and making sure you're fulfill, but also kind of doing, doing your part, you know, they, they work.

Speaker 2:          00:55:35       The intuitive is such an interesting point because your intuition depends on your respect for your consciousness. Respend. It depends on your respect for your honesty about your own actions and your own thoughts and your own ideas. And I find that when I am the most at peace with my own actions, then I am a much, a much better in tune with other people. And I've, I've met people that were completely full of shit. And like, how does this guy not know that he's full of Shit, not know that no one's going to buy this. I'll tell you how, because he's lying to himself because he's lying. He's lying

Speaker 1:          00:56:12       in a way. Positive reinforcement for his negative actions. If he keeps winning, yes. Even if it's negative, that's just going to reinforce that and reinforce that big

Speaker 2:          00:56:21       when I'm most honest myself is when I'm get the most intuitive reads off of people. I had one friend, my friend, Brian Cowen and I used to, he was like the worst guy for like being involved with friends that would turn out to be crazy and idiots and thieves and nuts and worst, the worst, uh, connections with girls. And I would always, I was like a big brother. Me. He's worried about you doing coke, doing coke. What's in your hand? Oh, bud light. No. Oh, it is powerful. Yeah. If you wanted to come down tonight, who knows? Maybe some of them won't show up. But uh, it's mad flavor. Aka Joey Diaz. Brian redband demand to my left. Uh, Josh mcdermitt, our good friend from that show, 30 and fucked in the ass or whatever. And me and a 10:30 here. ICEHOUSE. Fascinating.

Speaker 3:          00:57:19       Did you ever experience or experiment with any drugs? Did you ever do like mushrooms or anything growing up?

Speaker 2:          00:57:23       Do you know? This is on the Internet. People can hear this to be careful what you said. I'm just

Speaker 3:          00:57:31       Jesus Christ. I'm like, Oh wait, I'm not supposed to talk about something you looked at me like what? I mean I just slit your chair on far younger when I was like [inaudible] 93, I went to Lollapalooza and I was really a hippie kind of back there. And then in a tool was one of the. Because I used to be at nine snail fan growing up. Then it became some hippie and I never remember seeing tool and going like, why am I not so 1992? I'm moving on [inaudible] 93 of them, but a lot. I always wondered that because I mean, especially a year old, uh, old videos sober, uh, you know, just the visuals on that was just amazing when you're on mushrooms. But, uh, did you ever play with any of that kind of psychedelic stuff or never, never,

Speaker 2:          00:58:19       never do. What was the song that you did to the FIBONACCI sequence and now you're on drugs? He's, he's, he's, he's beautiful. It was beautiful. And what he is, you can't fake a Brian. I mean, he is just that, that's who he is. Yeah. There's no, it was a song that you did to the FIBONACCI sequence. Um, uh, I believe it was foggy mountain breakdown really? No, no, it was one of those songs, one of those songs. Yeah, whatever it is, you can find it online, Google it. But um, the, the, the FIBONACCI sequence, I watched a documentary about it once where they showed pine cones and pineapples and sunflowers and all these different things show that there's some sort, some sort of a mathematical code to nature. Right. And I, and I think the funny thing is like people

Speaker 3:          00:59:12       myself actually trying to like force those numbers on a song. It's kind of, it's kind of funny. It's kind of clunky because the song is that any song is that, so, you know, to Kinda

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       like, it's like, it's like, you know, my kid blocks like, Ooh, look through square. And they stack, um, the uh, every, everything is that. So it like actually like write your faces, force that into a song is a, as a little a sophomore. So I'm, I'm reprimanding myself for being a little silly. Oh, you're not, you will. I thought it was an homage to the, uh, the, the order of the universe. I didn't think there was silly at all, but that's as a fan. I enjoyed it, but I, it was just short for fanatic and I have to go now. That's why you know, you look at someone with a nose job and you go, what the fuck is going on here? Some of these ruined the sequence. You've ruined the FIBONACCI sequence. Now you gotta make you gotTa. Make Lemons into lemonade. You gotTa, you gotta make soup out of the Ham hocks and the beans that you've been given.

Speaker 2:          01:00:11       It's just, just is what it is. When, when, when you really find out that there truly is a mathematical sequence that the whole universe is based on it, it's one of those things that really makes you step back and go, we are, man, we might as well be fucking cave men because even though we like to think that with our four g connections and our satellite dishes in our cars that we somehow or another have elevated from the biological. Like Bob was, so it was still so base. We're still so stuck in the Rut of the mud and you know, we, we don't. We really, really have barely wrapped our heads around how complicated and insane and diverse this whole thing really is. The FIBONACCI sequence. To me, it's like one of those real, real mindfox. It makes you just pause and there was a particle physicist recently or theoretical physicist that was talking about when they study quantum mechanics, they find that there's some sort of an embedded code to it all.

Speaker 2:          01:01:12       That it's not just an embedded code. It's a recognizable code that is used in mathematicians and they said, look, fucking the whole universe is a program. It gets a program, you know, whether you call it, whether it's a biological program or whether there's intelligent design has been done by some engineer from pro beefiest movie, whatever it is. There's a program to this. I was always playing around with just a story where you actually day on the way to time travel would be to somehow connect into the base of your DNA and there's actually a time code in the DNA and you have to like reset it so that all of a sudden you just end up in this other time zone, but then you would. Your software wouldn't be compatible, so this whole script fell apart just before my eyes. Imagine if you did decide you were going to go into another dimension and you go into the the other dementia, you would just be engulfed in complete madness because you don't have the tools to deal with that new. Right? That's like that. Like you go to, you're going to hit enter and you're like, oh, I forgot a zero. Just fucking kaleidoscope

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       until the end of time. It's like that movie or the twilight zone episode. When was at Burgess, meredith was all just all he wanted to do was read and just leave me alone leave and he's in inside of a library and a nuclear explosion happens and everyone's dead, but he's surrounded by all these books and then he breaks his glasses. He's like, oh, fuck it. Just forever in this downward spiral of inability to perceive his environment. I'm worried about him. He's all right. I was worried about him for the first five years. I knew it. When we got into, we got into a groove and I know he knows exactly what he's doing. That's the only way to kill the hanging over. You just start. When he starts slurring, you're going to get nervous, but it's. He's okay. Yeah. He's always looking at you, man. He's got monitors too, so even when he's not looking at you, he's looking at you through monitors and what you really need to think about is the fact that out over a sold out show tonight at the thing. Yeah, the Ice House. The ice. He'll be up there. He's a comedian. He's got some funny jokes. You should come tonight. I'm working.

Speaker 3:          01:03:35       Yeah, you should let people invite themselves. That way you don't get rejected now. I'm actually pouring wine tonight at the. Oh you. If people want to go see, where is it at? It's a every Royce. It's an old, old Pasadena down the street here. I've heard crazy stories about you with these at signings A. I've heard shows. There's shows, shows that you've done when you tone your entire back to the audience during the entire performance. Have you done that? Have really an awful sensitivity to a flash. A flash. Cameras flashing. So if I, if the, if you just can't, people can't control themselves. I just have to. I can't, I can't focus on what I'm doing because I'll actually go into a convulsion. So I have really had to take an epileptic convulsion. I can't finish the set. So I'm sorry I have to turn my fucking back to you.

Speaker 3:          01:04:25       I didn't know that was even real to my friend. Jim's wife is epileptic and my message board would have these avatars that would fly and that's basically nobody's business. So it's like, you know, I, I asked you to fucking put the camera away to maybe if you told them fucking seizure me, mom, they get right up in your face because then you got the asshole who was a who still into nine inch nails from 92 and he's going to do the flash thing because he hates me. He hates you for leaving them. So you buddy. It's abandonment issues is pointed at you when he said that, do you, do you, do you know Trent? Do you do work with them ever? I, we've met several times, probably more than more than several, but I haven't talked to him. He grew his neck with val kilmer. Grew his head.

Speaker 3:          01:05:11       I haven't, I haven't seen him for awhile as it is. He's huge. He started bodybuilding, I think. Yeah, I think yeah, that was. I think he did start lifting, but I don't know. It's a weird thing for a musician, right? It's like a one point in time musicians. We're always sort of one of my favorite fucking scenes. I almost forgot this is you, uh, some guy jumped on stage, you hip toss them and they took his back and continue to look at him like he was ready for it. I got it. Yeah. Got It right there. What, what was that about? What was going on there? I mean, you obviously you didn't hurt him, so you sensed that he was friendly. Uh, yeah, it was, uh, it was my stage.

Speaker 3:          01:05:53       Like if you're up there you get choked. So beautiful. You give them links to the arm around and when you thought you were like the garden, do a, uh, like an Faq. So beautiful. But the thing is the guy didn't even try to fight that art look. He throws his arms up. He was just thinking Dick against his, his, his, his boats. He's like, ah, this is the best. I'm going to have a baby, but I'm a tool base to have a baby. And he painted blue. Pretty rare situation where you got the perfect retarded fan and I have a dozen fight hard. And how cool was it for him though you were singing while you had his back? Well, the, I think that's a, you know, there's not, there was no footage online that can. It shows me everything that happened. We actually had a guest singer come out on that song, read it right during that. So like not only the kid like have to deal with, you know, me doing that, but he had to sit through this other singer doing a thing to show you. Just held them back control. I had the wrap the cord around his

Speaker 5:          01:07:00       and continued singing

Speaker 3:          01:07:03       [inaudible] that's slack. So every time he would go and check the thing. That's so beautiful. Look at me. Was He talking to you? Well this is going on. I get my backup to.

Speaker 5:          01:07:17       No.

Speaker 3:          01:07:18       Can I see a little pat on the back end is where the security was going to leave you alone back then at it. You'll see there's the guy coming out to sing. It's a, it's Haitham. He's a friend of ours. He's going to do resist going on 97, 64, 64. Let's see. Back when you didn't get sued for Shit, right? Yeah. Because that happened. Now you'd be. You'd be fucked. I can't do anything. Would you not do that now? You probably do. You would just do it anyway. Yeah. I mean, I don't know what you're doing. You'd be crazy. You never know. That guy that killed dimebag Darrell. I did it once when I was young. Rewards words for you, John Lennon. I did it once when I was younger at a wing concert and now I look back at it. I cringe just thinking the fact that I fucking got up on stage and they actually had to stop there like they were in between songs and then I jumped back into the audience, but I was like, it just makes me sick to my stomach and I was like 18 at a wing concert, but I can't imagine doing that now.

Speaker 3:          01:08:25       Who makes you feel any better? If I was right next year, I'd be like, dude, pussy man, it, they'll be fine, man. This happens all the time. Like some bands like, like it, like I remember mighty, mighty bosstones nip slip, slip, mighty, mighty. Bosstones, you still like almost welcomed people on the stage, if I remember correctly, so I think that's why I did. I was like, oh, all bands are like this, you know, it's a social event. Yeah. I'm not trying to like convey a thing. Jump on up. What's up with your music not being on itunes? Is that something licensings bullshit crap owns. I'm sorry for asking them questions like for a perfect circle around it. Oh, they are? Yeah. What the fuck are you talking about son? Well, I, I recently went through a thing where I sold all my cds, a lot of my cds and I babbled rebuying them on digital, but yeah, I know keep them.

Speaker 3:          01:09:24       I know higher quality. I know his cd much higher quality a while now that they've got. There's a new version of, you know like MP, MP four a or whatever they are there that are pretty solid. It's a pretty solid and it all depends. It all depends on how you use compression because there's ways to do it where the new digital formats are actually pretty bad ass. Joseph, as good as CD quality, it's pretty. You would never notice the difference, especially when you're listening to it on this fucking thing like that Portlandia episode like let's have on these little speakers. Do you have one of those artists that emerged through the digital takeover of, of music. What was that like for you to watch that happen where all of a sudden your shit was online and you know, to go through the, you know, the whole, the whole scene with a.

Speaker 3:          01:10:12       well, I mean some people just kind of tried to fight it and there's other people that did know, had to do whatever they had to do to, to kind of embrace it. I know there's one thing I know for sure you cannot download my wine. That's right. Not a digital format. Not yet. Not until we have those printers that can print out your wine show. Crazy as that sounds retarded. Just five years ago. That sounds more walking around with a phone that's not connected to anything. That's funny. Yeah. Jay Leno has one of these three d printers in his shop. He puts a video online of him making parts for old cars with it. Yeah. It's fucking amazing. I mean, you just run it through a scanner and next thing you know it's. There it is. Yeah. And that's the beginning. I'm loving this wine now. I actually, I actually see that's the problem. His problem is it's okay. It's like at all the problems in the world, you know. When was the last time you were at the Olive Garden?

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       A lot longer. You motherfucker, you did it. I would have to go there for me to be my first time. Oh, you have never been. I'm not snooty. Is it hard to find good restaurants in Arizona? Yeah. Yeah. Where we are, there's a, there's a, there's a handful of pretty awesome places, but there's not as many as we would like. Uh, how far are you away from Phoenix? Two hours to Tucson worth four hours from Tucson. And then the other area of note is Sedona, right. That's where the donor has. Even Sedona has only a couple places that are really good, but you'll take that just for the small. I just cook myself. Yeah, you know, I just do my own Ravioli's and we know we have our own gardens and orchards. Yeah, that is a cool thing. We have a cook. I just started doing that this year. Grow my own vegetables.

Speaker 1:          01:12:04       We'll have like a salad made out of her own vegetables. There's something cool about that. There's something hunter gatherer that just so and it's anybody and even in a big city like this, if you have one of those apartments that has like a little bit of dirt near you, you can make your own food. Any any square, five square feet of dirt near you and you're in this community. You can grow enough stuff that you can get with your neighbors and the trade. That's my ultimate goal. Do the garlic and I'll do the potatoes and tomatoes and then you're just trading. You're happy. When I see a cue, like do something crazy like start a vineyard, you know that that to me is far more complicated than what I ever wanted to accomplish, but what I want to accomplish, find a way to live sustainably of one piece of land.

Speaker 1:          01:12:48       Whether it's a farm, a small family farm or what, you know, livestock, just as romantic as it sounds, it's not necessarily that feasible. I mean, there was, there was a lot of draw. There's a lot of things that just, you know, nature will nature will school you, it's, it ends up really coming down to a collaboration. It really does come down to, to not just hunter gatherer, a cultivator, but also community. You have to kind of work together to make any of that work. And that's, that's the reality. There's a lot of people that have that romantic notion of like, I'm just going to go out to the woods and just, and just live off the land and you're going to live a very short life. That's where a cult comes in. That's where the coal comes in. So by the land. Yeah. So there's definitely, it's definitely possible to do those kinds of things.

Speaker 1:          01:13:32       But as far as quality of life and the longevity, longevity of life, uh, the collaboration ends up actually fitting better that community, that village ends up really, really working hard to find that though, isn't it? It's hard to find some likeminded people that you can enjoy it, but it's already happening. There's an entire, there's entire, even where we live in Arizona, there's entire communities that have, uh, you know, the garden garden communities and uh, you know, we're making pasta is now, uh, that are from 100 percent Arizona wheat so we can grow wheat, we make the flower and I can actually make pastas for you to go with the wine, which we also grow. But the things we can't, I don't have, we don't make salt, you know, there's like spices you would like to have and that kind of thing. So it's ends up being your back to the trading, trading your. Whereas with other communities and that's great. But then just all the nutrition that you just get the basic, a fulfillment of that homegrown stuff. It resonates on a microfiber level in your body for sure.

Speaker 2:          01:14:36       Yeah, it's pretty bad ass. And Arizona is a tricky place to because you guys don't get a lot of rain. We get a little bit of rain and uh, it's a matter of. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:14:43       making sure you're planting in the right spot where the rain gets to

Speaker 2:          01:14:47       the cisterns. Cisterns, yeah. Do you have water storage? Carry the rain water and figure out a way to move it. Yeah. It's um, if you ever thought about living somewhere where it rains a lot, is that like a better option? No,

Speaker 1:          01:15:04       I, um, I just loved the Arizona is just where I'm supposed to be. Just, you know, I grew up in Michigan, so that's pretty moist and it's got those mosquitoes and deer fly and the humidity. I just can't, my body doesn't resonate in that place and uh, I just get attacked by every bug and every creature known demand and in places like Michigan in Seattle or Washington state and all that, but in an Arizona free and clear like there's, there are scorpions. I see them now and then I've seen the rattle snakes have none of that stuff. Bugs me, know that none of it goes after me. My Dad lives in Michigan, he's in Michigan, like none of that stuff bugs him. The deer fly the mosquitoes and stuff, it just kind of like bounces off him. It's fine. Comes to Arizona, immediately gets bit by a brown recluse walloped by tiger. Chased by a fuck

Speaker 2:          01:15:53       rattle snake. You know, like all this. Arizona just went, what are you doing here? Get Out. He got bit by a brown recluse. That's no joke. Yeah, like a big hole in his leg. Oh my God. Yeah. Have you seen that discussed? There's nothing they found, uh, with uh, Arizona is um, a Jaguar's coming across from Mexico. There's a, there was a show called monster quest where there were jaguars. No, no, no. The animal. Yeah. It's leopard in the Africa, right? Jaguar in South America. I think. So they've started to see Jaguars in, uh, in, in, in Arizona. Hunting. Republicans are. No, no. Yeah, just after a pio, they just, after that Joe Arpaio Guy, that's gotta be a weird thing representing your state. You know, when you, when you tell people you're from Arizona and they go, oh yeah, that's that fucking guy that makes people wear pink. Yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a wonderful

Speaker 1:          01:16:47       state to live in because it's the last state of the union where the 48 state, so we're kind of the infants and we're kind of the mavericks in a way. So there's all this unresolved like archaic shit that goes on there, but there's all this amazing, beautiful stuff as well that we actually get to do because we're not kind of part of the east coast. Like this is how it's done. We have been here for 200 years. It's actually, we're kind of still finding our way in a way. And so there's, there's the good and the bad that goes with that and there's probably a lot more bad that always it. But I don't, I'm not exposed to it because I'm good on that note. Uh, you know, the wine industry in general is, was met with like, you know, that's, that's, you know, it's alcohol, it's wine, it's, you know, the religious right in the room, in the conservative Republicans initially were like, what are you doing? But now we've changed. So we completely changed the agricultural and economic landscape of that state with what we're doing with the vineyards to the point where the governor, God bless her, has actually gone on record with the municipalities and said, support what he's doing, get behind them. That's how that's. So to have a conservative person who was like probably teetotal or anti alcohol, all that kind of stuff. Or have somebody like that who you already know her story, like to have them support. What you're doing is you're. We're definitely making a mark.

Speaker 2:          01:18:11       Interesting. That's a beautiful thing. If you're governor wasn't a fucking moron. That chick scary dumb. She's. So, if you've ever seen some of the debates with her holy Shit, where they asked her questions and she just locked up and just stopped talking and you're like, you're not allowed to do that. Not a lot of stop talking and then she still won.

Speaker 1:          01:18:30       Whatever that means. Yeah. She supports you. Yeah. The, it's, it's an amazing. It's amazing thing to witness the kind of the naysayers coming around to like, you know, having to like explain to them over and over again. There's like these small communities in Europe that they weather whatever storm you throw it out and they don't care who's king or dictator frozen it. Third small communities, they're small community to grow their own food and the and the cornerstone of their, of their economic stability is our vineyards and you know, something that takes dedication and time and focus and commitment to a long term thing and then everything around it can then sustain itself based on that being the hub.

Speaker 2:          01:19:08       Do you ever recognize how unique this is for someone who has achieved your position as a musician and you know, has some, has so much cultural influence to have this sort of radical change and just go off and start a vineyard and become a, a small local business?

Speaker 1:          01:19:27       No aid. The community like that. I mean, it's a really kind of an unusual departure. Well, I mean it's only a departure if you're only looking at the part of my life that had to do with music. If you're looking at the part of my life that came before the music, you know, I was, I was part of the military. I was, I was accepted to west point it become an officer and I chose not to go to, so to go into the arts. Um, so I was in some way already doing these kinds of things in a way, you know, you got your military and you get your politicians. Um, I was kind of part of that part of that structure to begin with organized sports, military ballet.

Speaker 2:          01:20:05       So you've, you've pocket pool, you've managed to really be your own unique individual. You've really managed to not find a pattern to fall into but rather fall into the pattern that you felt personally

Speaker 1:          01:20:19       drawn to kind of like, again, going back to just following your intuition about what your decision. I mean when you're standing there and you're having to make a decision, like when you received that appointment in your hand going, okay, I'm going to be an officer, I'm going to go to west point when I get out. I see. I can see my future all the way to the, to the end. You know, classmates of mine are now like kernels in charge of several divisions in Afghanistan. So that would be, that would be what I'd be doing right now. I mean, you know, I can't say that for sure because I'm not nearly the day dedicated soldier that those guys are and that kind of vision. But as far as that part of that corporation, that part of that company, that's what I was what I was, that's my path was laid out in front of me.

Speaker 1:          01:21:01       So to see that and go, I can be a part of that whole thing or I can follow this feeling in my stomach right now and go, I think I'm going to go to art school. So to actually make that decision and have all your friends and your family kind of go, what the fuck did you just do? And that was long before you'd ever heard about me and to know that that's what I was supposed to do. And to follow that against anybody else's advice. Um, you know, that's, that's a strong, a strong statement when it comes to following one's intuition,

Speaker 2:          01:21:38       do you realize how inspirational that is? I mean to, to a guy like me or two, especially two guys coming up that may, you know, or, or they have a vision, they have an idea and they see someone like you that they admire, that has done that and really has so obviously carved out the life that they really wanted to live based on their intuition, based on their idea which so few people ever actually do. We recognize that influence me because that's a, that's a huge thing for folks.

Speaker 1:          01:22:05       Yeah, always. It's always going to come down to what you, what you were going to decide for you. Uh, it's Kinda hard to. I had a, my old, uh, back in, uh, uh, Michigan. I went to a church. I did go to a church that's, I might disappoint you, but uh, she had up. I went to a few, a minister, a pastor, I should say. Uh, and the only reason I went to this place because the guy made this guy made sense. Super Low key, awesome speaker. He told stories, had no judgment. I mean, you know, there's one point I was having problems and you know, people or thought that it was way too into kiss and Alice Cooper wanted to get to talk to the preacher and he called me in the Avi and I kind of went into his place and he went, he shut the door and go, so tell me all about this band.

Speaker 1:          01:22:49       I was like, I can eat freely and as a small look, and he just listened to all of that stuff. Then he started kissing, you know, can you do, can you say that with your pants off or nothing like that. And it was nothing. He was just into like, so what is it about this that like resonates with you? What is it? What is it that inspires you about it? And I was like telling me stories. He goes, I'm a storyteller. I like that you'd like to tell stories. You should tell him more stories. And I started writing poetry. I started writing stuff based on that conversation with him. So you know, out of that. And they used to tell the story that I thought was very pertinent, you know, you'd go off to camp and you'd have some experience there and you come back and uh, whatever you experienced out there, whatever, whatever camp that was you went to metaphorically and you come back to the general populous, it's you.

Speaker 1:          01:23:42       He would always tell the story about Moses coming down from the mountain and having his mountain top experience and then coming back down to the rat race to where people, he's a changed person. There's something different in his eyes and he's watching everything that's happening and there's no possible way he will ever be able to like explain to his people that he sees daily what the fuck happened because they didn't happen to them. It happened to him. He saw it and it just has to kind of, you know, his life on that and not be disappointed in his, in his friends and family and his community because they didn't see it. So it's not, it's not their fault. They didn't, they didn't experience that. But he has to like not. He has to kind of understand that a, everybody has to go through that themselves if they're going to go through it.

Speaker 1:          01:24:26       Like the other thing we talked about with kids going into the military and having that like that moment where you're on your own, you know, you stick your hand in the jar with the ants and you know, that kind of thing. You're talking about that coming becoming an adult, a Houston. He would tell that story and it was very important, very important lesson for me to go, okay, you're on your own with these decisions. You kind of have to have these things and not everybody's going to get it, so don't worry about everybody getting it.

Speaker 2:          01:24:52       Just as long as folks though to have that sort of confidence to branch out independently on their own with the vision that are terrifying. It's terrifying, but that's the only way you really. Yeah. You can find your own path. Yeah. That's so hard for people to accept and so on. It's not what people want to hear. They, they, they, they, you know, it seems. It's so terrifying to be completely independent of all the people around you giving you other advice, but

Speaker 1:          01:25:18       so I want to do it and if you see it, you know that's, that's how, that's how things happen. You see something that's not being done or you see something that's your you want to have happen. If it's not happening, go do it.

Speaker 2:          01:25:28       It's got to. You got to be honest with yourself as well to it. You have to actually know what you really truly want. A lot of people will talk themselves into things that they want because there's maybe security in it or they could see a connect the dots future. But Dude, thank you very much for coming on this podcast and been amazing. It's a. you've got an awesome story, man. You're a bad motherfucker and you've done a lot of cool shit and it was really fun. We enjoyed it. Thank you for having me. I'm really sorry about Brian. Wrong with. Sorry. I was nervous around him. It's natural. Sure.

Speaker 1:          01:26:00       I will wear pants next time if you ever come back. That

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       was. That was kind of awkward, but like I got over it. Oh, thanks for the wine. The wine is fantastic. People want to get a hold of it. It's just you have to caduceus and the other one, American vineyard market vineyards and they can get them at most fine wine show available online.

Speaker 1:          01:26:21       Uh, yeah. Uh, we have a website, a Vino dot [inaudible] dot org. We're going to start taking preorders but no problem living in Arizona is we can't ship during the summer at all. It just gets too hot and everything that we ship goes through Phoenix and sits on a hot truck at 100, 10 degrees overnight. So a kinship there and you have to wait till October to ship stuff. Oh Wow. But we have some sort. How does that work? We had some pretty awesome stuff coming out on, you know, going to be available to the first week of August for release in October. Awesome.

Speaker 2:          01:26:51       So, uh, that's when people. Is there a stuff available now or is it you have such limited amounts that

Speaker 1:          01:26:56       places like silver lake wine or mission wines or Kennel wine merchants to a lot of those guys have stuff that we've distributed and across around the country at 10, you know, we're only in a very, just a handful of states. We just. Our production is so low. Again, people want what they want, but when it comes to the wine, there's only so much that's going to come off this site and we have very limited amounts and it's a very special thing, so we're not gonna. We can't even if I wanted to increase the production on some of these things, we're just never gonna have enough to just basically be in every grocery store around the country. It's pretty obvious that you take great pride and satisfaction in your work. I mean, when you're talking about your one, you have a certain feeling about you, like this is something you're really happy with. Yeah. It's a, it's a, it's a very fulfilling endeavor. It's a, it's a, it's an art form that's like no other and it's kind of connected. Grapes are a very special being. They're special.
