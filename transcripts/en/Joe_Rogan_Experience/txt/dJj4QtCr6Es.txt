Speaker 2:          00:00:55       that soundtrack. It's going to be responsible for some ringing in my ears when I'm an old man. I know that it can't be good for you. Whoa, whoa. It comes into abrupt ending getting crappy today with all new things. The Alpha brain, is that what it is? It's tweaked you have you taken a Brian? Yeah. You know what I was, I tweeted something the other day that I, right after I did, I'm like, you know, that actually is not a given. Probably a good thing, but it is a good thing. Like I sounded good. I feel like I need Alpha brain now. You feel like you're addicted to it? Kind of, but it's like addictive. Not for a bad reason. It's addictive for a clearheaded reason. Like almost like, hey, I should have been on prescription drugs the whole time, you know, but I'm not, you know what I mean? If you've got on the real shit, why don't you get on the real one? Don't go to a doctor and see it might have something for you that works. Awesome. Yeah. I mean you might be like wrestling with life and you might just go to some place and they might be, if you've seen his beard.

Speaker 2:          00:01:55       Beard is like to the homeless. Yeah, it's, there's carrot juice in it too. I could taste it. I think it looks like you don't give a fuck. I like that look. Definitely looks like it doesn't mean what it looks like. The guy was a relaxed job. I was just on Rachael Ray the other day. I trim the shit out of mind like, yeah, like I was a black football player, like downlines here a little longer here. I don't know if I like manscaping. I was thinking about manscaping in my girl's like, no, I like the crazy homeless look like I like it looks like you're, you're the one that's, I know you've got a good one girl. White facial hair. Like any girl wants you to shave all that. Oh, shave all that. That's a broken bitch. I want that one in your life. Have you noticed like when he shaved like underneath your Chin and it starts to grow back just a teeny bit like a five o'clock shadow. It looks weird. It looks like you're a kid. You can't over aggressively make the jaw line right. Then you look like one of the gay guys that just trying to look skinny. The steam room. You, my wife was like, you need to grow that shit out. I had great beard trimming advice guys who tried to look skinny eligible. That's at least what I thought when they walked by me. So this is like the outline

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       of the Jawbone, is that what it is? But not even really. It's like where they've wished the job on where it's like Bob from biggest loser used to rock that shit. He's totally gelled on a Christian Asheville. Carolina, you were on a quick Christian rock station in Asheville. Right. And they were like keep it a Christian. And I was like been Christian. They said that's the opposite of stay black. Cause the exact opposite of stay black, Cuban Christian. Don't get no dicks in your ass. I think the ending still the same. Oh so, so he shit. Whoa. So then I go, don't worry about it. I'll talk about the biggest loser because I was obsessed about the biggest loser and I was like, where can we use it? Ron? One of the biggest loser because the girl was due and the girl's like, we've started talking about, and I was like, I go, first of all, Bob and Gillian are beasts because I've worked out in Bob Spin, classic crunch La and I go, he said one of the greatest things when in a workout, I remember again I was like 220 pounds and getting ready to go home for Thanksgiving and I'm doing spin class and he says, I want you to stay out of the saddle, stand on the salmon for Thanksgiving.

Speaker 4:          00:04:03       You're going to see people you grew up with. Do you want them to look at you and go God I wish I fucked him. And I'm like, yes, yes. And I'm pedaling and pedaling and then, but I didn't say pug during the thing. And then the girl goes and how'd you say that? Wished that they had been with you. They want them to look, really think your life is better. It was like a long rant cause then cause then I ended up, I go, the only thing that bummed me out was he's gay. So then the whole time she goes, hold on, Bob is not gay. And I was like, no, Bob's really gay. Like definitely you were allowed to say no, she no, she just didn't know Bob. The guy she's modeled her life after is a homosexual. She had no idea was Bob, by the way.

Speaker 4:          00:04:44       Bob and Gillian are the host of this show. As Bob's totally gave me. I've never watched the show, so I'm just, yeah, Bob. Bob is out. Oh yeah. But she doesn't know. He's not out. Like you didn't come onto like Andrew, you know, like whatever talk show and go. So I was, I'm really gay, but like not that he would see like Anderson Cooper out as anthem, Suku Brown. I think he's on time. He's gay. I never thought he was gay and he was heroic. I have no problem with gay, but he seems gay. It seems like a very nice game man. Yeah, he's definitely pretty lips. He's Devon Anderson. Cooper's definitely seems like it. No he didn't. No, he is. But I like the guy. Yeah. I have nothing wrong with him. Be for a lot of people. That's a huge issue though. Oh yeah. That's all America.

Speaker 4:          00:05:25       That's a bummer of an issue, man. I'm like, what do you give a fuck? Why? Who Do you, why do you care to farmer? Some dudes fuck fat chicks that Tom Breau Kroll is one of those people. Do you ever think so? It's just cause it's competition and he's old school. He's like, we are coming up behind me and the ratings making me nervous. He's got old school gates. There's moe decker, [inaudible] cock word of mouth her. I lived around gay kids or gay people rather. I lived around a lot of gay people when I was growing up. I got just really to it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       I lived in San Francisco from seven to 11 so the whole time we were constantly around gay people. The only time was ever weird was when some dude whistled at my stepdad was like, Whoa, that's really, yeah, that was fucked up. I was like, that's not just not just like rude, like guys walking with his son and you're whistling at them and go, he made like a like one of those and I was like, oh this is the creepiest fucking thing ever being seven years old and have somebody do that. But that's just the Douche bag. That guy could have been a guy he could, you know. But it's true

Speaker 4:          00:06:30       guy rather. He's the same guy working the sledgehammer that sees the growing or the over the aggressive, a lesbian trying to pick up lemon. If you ever say no, no, no, fuck that. I'm talking about the [inaudible] woman lesbian that walks up to me and say shit to me at a gay bar. I live with two lesbians in New York for a long time and man you, and we'd go out to their bars cause they wanted to go there and we'd go and hang out and have beers and then there'll be that check to just roll up on me. Like, what are you doing here? And you're like, come on, I'm just hanging out. What are you doing here? No one wants you here and you'd be like, ugh. And then my friends would be like, he's with us. He's our roommate, and always wanted to be like, bitch, I'm the guy that turned you into the girl you are today. Don't ever fucking forget that.

Speaker 4:          00:07:15       Let me get you a drink. Wow. Some pent hostility that Bert Kreischer. Yeah. Wait, wait, wait. Let's go. Can we go back for a second about our brain? Sure. Okay. Because, so you give me a buck, gave it to you and I forgot I gave it to you and I offered to give it to you again today and I took it because this is what you're telling me, that you had tweeted about some crazy dreams. I didn't hear them. Okay. Not even crazy dreams we're talking about. Does anyone know what a real fucking lucid dream is? Okay. A lucid dream for anyone that's not listening. In my opinion, this is what these pills did to me. Okay? It's a dream. When the middle you go, Oh fuck, I'm dreaming. We can do anything I fucking want. Okay. Now it is good at. So I had a dream one time, I was going in to do an important TV thing and I was nervous about it.

Speaker 4:          00:08:01       And so I took, I was taking Alpha brain and in the dream I went in, I did it and I did it wrong and it, but it was so fucking real. It was so real. I could taste it. And I was depressed in the middle of a dream, depressed that I fucked this up. And then I got in the elevator to leave and I saw that I was wearing, um, uh, highlight a neon red Casa workout pants with a matching needs. I cousin Neon, a Bandana and no shirt. And I was like, okay, this is clearly a fucking dream. But then I realized

Speaker 1:          00:08:27       yourself dressed shirtless with a bandanna on to realize, but

Speaker 4:          00:08:32       I realize it's a dream. And then I went, that's how you realized it. It was so fucking real spin. Your cradle cradle. Imagine, imagine just off the fucking interview where it's like everything you never wanted to say came out right and you handled everything wrong. And I went, okay. So I wake up, I'm freaked out and I'm like, and I'm like, okay, that's how not to do that. I just problem solved the day. I'm not concerned because I know not to say cause I know how that goes. Now I know know what to say. So then, so then the next night, and no bite, mind you every night, my wife's telling me you got to stop taking these fucking awful brains cause I'm on fire. I'm like 10 o'clock at night and I'm still talking about these ideas like I'm fucking, they really woke me up. They go to bed the next night I'm in the middle of a dream, I'm doing a photo shoot and the dream on wheelchair.

Speaker 4:          00:09:14       And I go, I go, what the fuck am I doing? Almost you're doing a photo shoot. This is a dream. I can do anything I fucking want right now. And I literally say everywhere we go guys, I'm going to wrap this a dream. And they go, Huh? And I walk out and I, well I'm will sure. And I fly up La Cienega right now, fly, fly. I just go, fuck it. I can fly and I start flying and I go, this is fucking awesome. Now mind you, it's also dream. So I got lost in the hills. So I was like, fuck, where the fuck am I? Like no, this is real. So I don't know where the fuck I am. And I ended up my buddy Lorenzo's house and I was like, I was like, I want to say I wanna see my girls, let's go to my house.

Speaker 4:          00:09:49       And he's like, okay. And then, you know, in, in dreams and they just transformed other things. But every one of my dreams has been more insane. And the fact that you can interact inside them fucking full lips me out to the point where I was like, I gotta hop off him cause I need some rest because I'm going into dreams. Fucking problems solving shit. This shit going on in your brain that use dream about that night. I'm going in with the ability to work on in my sleep. I fucking love these things. Wow. John Moore, one of my good friends who, uh, who's, uh, was one of the writers, uh, to the, to the Chine roast was like, he had heard about some of dreams. You said, I got to get these fucking things and then started tweeting, like hitting you retweeted one of his things. But man, these things are fucking awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:10:31       That's the biggest effect for me is the dreams. The way I said it is like a normal lucid dream to me is like a bubble, like a children's bubble. Like it's so fragile. Yeah. By the time you realize you have it in your hand, it's gone. Like every time I've ever had a lucid dream before I would have them. And then right in the middle of that I realized I was dreaming and then boom, I'd wake up. Right. But in these, instead of being made out of a bubble, it's made out of a dodge ball that dodge,

Speaker 5:          00:10:56       you can just punch it and fucking move it around. You just wake up in a dream and you go, oh, I'm going to dream. And you just keep going in the dream. It's very strange. Last night I was testing a plywood wakeboards for the CIA and Weeki Wachee and I was like, I was like fucking totally right. I saw this video that was the closest of what I love to drink about, which is flying. Yeah. I think a lot of you all have that dream about flying around. Like you were saying, there's this thing called a body with these body pair of shoots. Have you seen this video, Joe? It's uh, there's this thing called the need for speed and mountain carving and it's these guys that have these parachutes attached to their bodies and they just fly around these mountains like just flying over trees and it's, it's crazy. Wow. Look at this shit as soon as I can get it to is this, is this, is this the guy? But they got to jump up a mountain, right hunt. I think what it uses that uses the air, uh, like they've done

Speaker 6:          00:11:54       it here in Calabasas also. I've seen these people with these parachutes is just uses like the air or the heat of the air or something like that. But it's a, it's on Vimeo. It's called the need for speed mountain carbon checkout. It will freak you the fuck out. Like it's, it's terrifying. Uh, when you see this shit, Oh yeah, I've seen this, I saw this. Yeah. This does look really scared. But these guys also die very often. Do they like a lot of, lot, like more than dude's roller blade? It seems like it's, it seems like it's so close that that like it's just takes one little small little mistake to fucking die. You're talking too loud. You get your mouth like right on that thing and it gets like way elevated this, they're like squirrel. Yeah. But those things are dangerous as fuck. They're really dangerous.

Speaker 6:          00:12:39       We did something with someone who was doing shark diving thing. By the way. I'm going to do shark dive and Rachael Ray and a couple of weeks. What are you trying to die with? Rachael Ray show with Rachael Ray. Man, Mexico. Two days. Let me tell you something, and this is like, don't, nevermind. Don't repeat this. That what I was gonna say. Just don't ever want to tweet Rachael Ray, that was talking about on your podcast, but he's very private, but we just stayed up late, too late, got hammered. The trolls are in motion calls down, set up a buffet, like just fucking, I had never had more fun with someone. Like are you in love with Rachel Ray? A little. Not In love. I could if she was a man. I have a man crush. If she was a dude, she'd be your bestie. Oh, she was my dude. Oh, we'd be hanging out in my man cave all the time.

Speaker 6:          00:13:21       Wow. That's really fun. She's a lot of fun. She's really cool. More grounded than anyone and this is the only reason I say she's grounded is a, some people ordered some wine to a room and I've dealt with a lot of, I don't know how rich he is, but I'm assuming she's wealthy. I've go around a lot of people in sometimes when the bill comes a and everyone expects them to sign it, they just sign it and she looked at, it was like, who ordered a $350 bottle of wine? And then they were like, she was like, where is it? I'm going to definitely have a glass of that. She goes, this isn't a $350 bottle of wine. There's a least at most a 70 of wine from room service. Send someone up to talk to me about a 350 and I was like, whoa.

Speaker 6:          00:13:57       I was like, man, she's a real motherfucker. That Shit my wife does. So somebody tried to fuck her over someone. They sent extra shit up to her room and she was like, this isn't a $350 yeah, not at all. I never took him off. Was this fucking Mexico? Oh, in Mexico they got crafty. San Miguel de Allende dude. What is it like traveling through fucking Mexico right now? Oh, I'll tell you, cause I had a fucking security detail. What's fucking Edgar meets me piece on his back, right? Old School, Mexican. Just sit to the airport at Walcott and goes, Mr Crutcher. And I was like, yeah. And he goes, let's go. And he, that dude followed me everywhere. I went to the bar to drink by myself. He sat and watched. Really, he slept outside of my room like let us outside my room cause he was just like, it's, it's, you know, it's also Rachel's production in there.

Speaker 6:          00:14:45       They're not going to cut corners on safety, you know, and what the fuck kind of feeling is that I got a picture of him. I'm sure I tweeted it, but fucking real dude followed me everywhere to the point that when we went, I had to go back to their board is like an hour drive hour drives a little sketchy in Mexico and we drove back. He drove with me. I check in, I checked my bag in and I go, all right, a Greg him like a hundred bucks cause he never left my side. I go, thank you. Grazia is, he spoke no English and he goes, um, he goes, no, no, no. A key, a key and went no, no, no. I'm just checking in now. He goes, Aki, Aki until [inaudible] or what? Our airplane, whatever, until you get on the airplane, I'm not leaving.

Speaker 6:          00:15:22       So he waited, watch me go through security and then sat there in case I had a problem. I was fucking awesome. And Rachel had one too, but his was much earlier and much better looking. Herzer better looking guy was a fucking stored. Yeah. Like I'd like to get uncomfortable around. No, she had hit, she hit him and she had this black dude too who is from America that she brought just extra Eddie. Do you think they tag team? No, but I so badly wanted to get drunk with her and go, let's make our security details bite like a fuel and make them fight and let's just go to a room and then I'd make them fight and I fight out in the out. Teach them to teach us how to pistol whip somebody want something fun in Mexico? Yeah, Dude.

Speaker 6:          00:16:00       So will you terrified we ever able to relax? No, it was totally tear. I was totally relaxed and I was totally not terrified at all. Yeah. Because although even though you have all the security everywhere, the second you have a security guy, you get brave and you're like, I can do whatever the fuck I want. Really know there's like egg or where do we get some tee shirts? He goes, AH, north side, north side here, a key. So we just stayed at this bar and drank. He just watched me drank the whole fucking night and I sent and then it kept mixing up Kiddos and tns. So like I would want to see, I wanted to say, do you want a cigar? But instead I just looked at him like, do you have a fucking cigar? And he was like, no, no, no sample. But who's awesome. It was really cool. That's a big mistake. Yeah. It turns you from a nice guy too. A douchebag. Yeah. And then, but I realized at the end of the night when I said it again and I said, do you want to go to bed with me? And then I said, you have to go to bed with me. It's a joke. I missed that joke. I'm not good on Mexican material.

Speaker 7:          00:17:02       Did you see anything fucked up while you were there at all? Any, any gun fire shit? Any cars pulled over the side of the road with tanks or anything crazy? No, it was pretty, it was a really fucking laid back. They say if you're in parts of Mexico, it's like really safe. It's border to border town and it's just fucking, but being an ignorant American, I just assumed that the whole country is fucked. It's like meanwhile, if you came to America and you, if you were an alien and you landed in Detroit at a nowhere, this is the first place she landed a straight shot from Alpha Centauri, right to Detroit. You would be convinced that the Holocaust has already happened. There's bears roaming the streets of Detroit. They've had bears. They'd take photos of bears in residential neighborhoods because no one lives there anymore and it's just the craziest fucking city of all time. 50% can't read be literacy or, yeah. The literacy rate in Detroit is 47% that was what it,

Speaker 4:          00:18:01       you can have the two top most dangerous cities in it to both of them are the two top ones. Flint is flow. I can't remember this. One of the arguments is it so is Alaska and I think that's just what the population, you know the ratio of the population, the percentage of people that get murdered. When I heard this is going to sound racist, but I'll say it anyway. I heard that the reason the Alaska so dangerous is that why people up there? No Eskimos a slur by the way up there. Did you know that? Yeah. Someone just told me that I'm supposed to say it and you Eskimos like calling it black eye on nigger. Hey, that's what it's like. That's what caught me off guard. I was like, no, no, that's exactly what it is. Or now how ridiculous is that? I didn't know cause I'm calling everyone Eskimos. Oh Shit. Walking around like a time machine and jumped ahead of time from the 50s into the 2000. I was like, one of the side effects from Alpha brand new. Both learn that that at the same time,

Speaker 7:          00:18:57       goddamn orientals coming from this guy. He said orientals once and someone said, hey man, that's a slur. And I go, Whoa, how could oriental be a slur? It's from the Orient.

Speaker 4:          00:19:08       Yeah. You didn't know that. That's a big, that's a huge flag. Oh, orientals and object. Yeah. Yeah. But the orient is a place. So being oriental, oriental person that used to be acceptable. Yeah. When you could purchase people to run that make your railroads. Oh yeah. I think they were like, we bought all these orientals. Yeah. We brought them over here. I never thought these other oriental objects, like this rug and this hash pipe.

Speaker 7:          00:19:40       Wow. I never thought of it that way. Wow. I always thought of it as just being a designation or, or, or, uh, a, a past where you're from. You know, what part of the world, like being a European, I always thought it was, you know, or being a westerner. Yeah, being an oriental, I really didn't think that it was an offensive term.

Speaker 4:          00:19:59       In Canada. They call Indians what we would call native Americans. They just call them natives and I was like, that sounds fucking aggressive. That's so aggressive on these fucking natives. There's water.

Speaker 7:          00:20:14       The idea is crazy really, that human beings have only been on this continent for a couple of thousand years now and over the last couple hundred, I mean, could you imagine taking a look in any other part of the world and take a look at it from 500 years ago, 600 years ago, and you know, there'd still be people there 600 years ago here. Fucking no horses, man. There was no witnesses. Yeah. American Indians didn't have horses. They didn't get the horses until the Europeans came over here. They do. They were so, they were complete nomads. They were running down deer. They would do what's called persistence hunting, where they would run down dear until the deer died of exhaustion and they were most of the time too tired to even eat. And so the, the whole village would eat mean. It'd be like close to death. They would be close to death to kill a steer. Are you shitting out? Was of a common way of hunting back then and then they found the horse when the Europeans came here. That was easy. That was the problem with when the Europeans came here, the people who are living here at the time because of their, their, their folk lore and you know, I believe it's the ancients, they thought that the people on horses were gods. They thought this is, this is a god, like someone riding an animal. Like they had never seen that before ever.

Speaker 6:          00:21:31       It is bizarre because you and Collin, this is a fucking, now I'm doing a podcast fan of [inaudible], but you and Kat Callan had talked about that one time and I have been obsessed with the concepts that we can, we have dominion over these fucking animals that are so much bigger than us. It would, you would think if you're a fucking native American Indian and you see this Spaniard with the mustache and the steel hat, it goes up like this carrying buckets of gold on a stallion. Just, yeah, it's impressive.

Speaker 7:          00:22:00       Well, what's going on is that the whole rest of the world was doing agriculture but in hunt in, but in North America, people were hunting and gathering. You know, it was, it was a completely different group of humans who was all the people that came down from the Bering Strait from Siberia. That's where the humans were, that that's all the American Indians. You know, they figured that out because some guy was convinced that the Mormon books were true and that Joseph Smith had told the truth and Joseph Smith had said that the, what the American Indians were with the last lost tribe of Jesus and that they had come to America with the last words of Jesus and were written on these golden scrolls and only he can read them all the shed. And so this guy in trying to prove that it was true actually did like a DNA test on native Americans and found out that they're Asian, that they come from Siberia, come from the connection or weight. Imagine I would love to foster those people just walked man. And they say they have the same culture for thousands of years because when they got here, there was no civilization here before because the entire fucking continent was covered in ice. We don't even, we can't even wrap our head around that. Like for, for thousands and thousands of years, there was nothing here. There was just melted ice and a few fucking weird, you know, annual type people wandering around killing things of bows and arrows,

Speaker 6:          00:23:25       putting nuts, man, I, you said something that I, that I'm going to, hopefully this will make sense, but, so the Indians did not know how to bring the corn closer to their house. They just were like, well, the corner over there.

Speaker 7:          00:23:40       Well, I don't know about that. I don't know. They probably know Agora. Well, and you know, and when they first came down there certainly wasn't, but I, it's, I dunno whether or not Indians established their own agriculture. Nobody than they supposedly, oh, no, no, no. It was, it was the tobacco it, but it was the idea that the Americans or the rather the original settlers taught the American Indians, the native Americans had to plant their corn. Wasn't that,

Speaker 2:          00:24:06       I wouldn't think so. I think we could have known and here's why. Here's the only reason I agree or I hear that and I go, who should fucking know? That's something we should know. Like Charlie Brown probably taught us that

Speaker 6:          00:24:20       politician guy when I was a while ago and he was very racist, older, um, like from the south and he was slamming like fucking, uh, the people of that, the, the native people of South America. He was like, these motherfuckers couldn't even use a wheel and it cause apparently. Yeah. And I was like, whoa. And I was like, shut up. And I just thought he was just being racist. It was fun to listen to. But apparently it was true when the Spaniards came over there, like that toy you give your children will use it to move fucking hall shit. I was like, fuck.

Speaker 7:          00:24:55       Well, you know what's even more incredible, what this was all post when they had built those pyramids. So all this, you know, that's thousands of years ago. So they built the pyramids and use the fucking wheel. Well, we don't, we don't have a goddamn clue as how they built Cheech needs a or any of those places. But they built them essentially without any horses that, without, you know, and then, but I didn't even machines and these, these fucking people built these incredible stone structures in the jungle. You know, I don't know how the fuck they did it. The obviously did figure out how to do it.

Speaker 2:          00:25:28       That's a fucking reality show. It's amazing. Can you make a pyramid now using horses? No. Horses the loud. If you wait, if we catch you bringing in a horse on the plane, you're, you're off the show. Yeah. You, uh, listen

Speaker 7:          00:25:41       to the podcast that we have with Graham Hancock. Did you listen to that one? Yeah, the, he's on the money. I think he's dead on their money. I think that there was a, there was a whole other advanced civilization a long time ago and they got wiped to fuck out. Well, after you're talking about aliens, well he didn't, he, I don't think he had a really specific, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:25:58       nobody that night right after I saw that I saw a thing on, um, on, he was on history channel about 80 yards. Yeah. And they were talking about how the, how the fucking aliens, it's all the aliens. And I was like, and then I think I mixed the two and then I make that up.

Speaker 6:          00:26:12       Um, and the, uh, the guy with a British accent,

Speaker 7:          00:26:16       Giorgio sucralose. Who Guy who was a, no, Graham Hancock has a guy with a British accent. Giorgio sucralose is, the guy was from ancient aliens. We had him on the podcast too. Gray Heron. Yeah. He's an interesting cat. He believes everything is alien.

Speaker 6:          00:26:29       It's how long until you're tired of talking to people?

Speaker 2:          00:26:32       I don't, I don't have a problem with it, but when are you going to tap out and be like, I think I've talked to everyone. I want to talk to him. Well, nothing. Never because I'm talking to you again. You know, it's like I think all I know I get two more visits and

Speaker 8:          00:26:44       you're gonna be like, dude, Dunkin says that every time it comes over, man. I don't know if family thing you talked about, man, go, don't worry about it, dude. Let's just fucking riff. Come on. It's taught you, you're always going to have a look. You're not going to stop thinking, man. You're not going to stop. You're not going to stop experiencing life. You're not going to stop having revelations. You're not going to stop having stories.

Speaker 5:          00:27:04       You know? It's crazy. You've had training in doing podcasts before we even did started this podcast because I don't know how many times, like after a show or something, we would all go eat. It's always going to go eat with like everybody that were hanging around with and we would sit there for hours and did the same thing as a podcast. But without fucking recording. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:27:24       Oh Dude. We had some classic conversations with you and me and Eddie Bravo and you know every comedian are Rhea, Joey [inaudible]. And let me tell you the best thing about this podcast is, is what I'm waiting for a fucking Falcon. The land on your arm, dude.

Speaker 5:          00:27:38       By the way, if you want to make your own Falcon risk thing just used pineapple. I had been making Falcon Risks Cause we've been juicing and

Speaker 8:          00:27:45       we just got a juicer. Say, well you were going to say, we're going to say I fucking got obsessed with Eddie Bravo one night. Really just obsessed. It's like the window. You guys were talking about him making, creating a move and then some guy moot use that move for the first time. That was when a guy caught the first twister in the UFC. Right. And then I'll really create the move. He just invented a whole lot of setups for it and became a master at it and really good at teaching it. Right. And then I started following them on Twitter and then I was like, Eh, I do. He just is so much more diversity human being. Then anyway, I start researching them and I'm like, well he's got 10th planet. He does his own Jujitsu. He teaches Jujitsu, he's written books about it. He's in a band.

Speaker 8:          00:28:22       He's, I go out, he seems a lot more diverse than the majority of people out there. So then I just started reading all his Wikipedia, watching all these videos, and then I'm like, okay, this is getting borderline gay. I go, there's no way, any problems watching my shit. He's an interesting dude. I never met a guy like Eddie Bravo. Fascinating guy. He's the guy who got me to smoke weed. That's what I was like. I was like, how did that Doug Benson smoked, didn't smoke weed until he was like 30 also, look man, if you, if you don't know, and one of the reasons why a lot of people don't like pot, it's cause they're not smoking pot. You know one of the reasons why they're worried about other people doing it because they're scared they're going to like it themselves and they're scared about doing it. It's like the same thing about doing scare them up being a loser. That's what you're scared about. You not scared. I'm telling you, it's not going to make you a goddamn loser. I thought it did and a lot of you do too. It's a trick. Had been fooled. It's a, it's a very fabulous tool for the mind

Speaker 5:          00:29:13       and in 45 days we are all going to get rid of our local pot shops because Obama is destroying us all and we're all going to die. Are you shitting me? Yeah, they, he phrases

Speaker 4:          00:29:24       it so eloquently like a gay woman because of I was destroying us. A woman, a gay woman. That's a gay man. Hands flap out like slipper drawing us all and we're all gonna die. Now you said that you couldn't have said that gay anti Gracie. That was such

Speaker 7:          00:31:40       He, they, he was at a guy's house and they were all partying and snort and drugs. This is the store. And the dude wakes up in the middle of the night cause he hears snoring. Just ridiculous. Snoring goes downstairs, opens up the bathroom. There's a dead guy in the bathtub with a dog collar on next to a snoring weatherman and they're both naked and there's no water in the bathtub.

Speaker 2:          00:32:07       It's awesome. You got to know that somewhere out there there's someone that's fucking up way harder than you. It's a prospective enhancing the water. Just all emptied into their assholes. I don't know. No, probably not. We were the first words out of your mouth. You're woken up. There's a dead guy with a dog collar on you and you're in a bathtub. First words out of your mouth. She don't wake him up. He sounded does face was purple. Oh, okay. He's totally dead. He was dead. He was 68

Speaker 7:          00:32:34       probably choked on his own vomit. And who knows? Overdosed when. Oh, so what's your, you don't

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       say anything? You can see I give somebody that's not a fucking party. Get Out.

Speaker 4:          00:32:44       Fucking shake it off. That's how you know. Nobody could ever

Speaker 1:          00:32:49       say shit to that dude. I mean, I know you're the king of partying you so much so that they made that van wilder movie that movie's based on you and this is a true story. A lot of people don't know this sounds like horse shit, but they made a fucking movie based on you being such a party animal. But you can't fuck with that guy. If he wants to talk. I saw who parties hardy bitch. I party so hard with people. They die sometimes naked. They're in a bad dog or that dog collar. That's how you know you're partying hard, dude. You're partnering with winds up naked with a dog collar on dead.

Speaker 4:          00:33:23       You know how hard it would be to get people out for drinks and mean that homeboy, I just fell asleep. It didn't even bother him. He, you know this is fucking dead and he's snoring so loud. He wakes to flog it dude up. They wake him up and he's like, can you imagine your store? Who the fuck is snoring? Man, it's fucking party. Been over for two hours. Who's in my house got damaged?

Speaker 1:          00:33:47       You come wandering downstairs and that's what you find dead guy with a dog collar on. Fucking well let me out and wonder what they're snorting credible. The anticodons Oxycontin's apparently are all the rage. That's what a, they're having a real real problem with with kids. I did it recently. Did you really

Speaker 4:          00:34:07       retard

Speaker 5:          00:34:10       cause you're going to pass out backwards. Trying to go the other way. I took two hits just to try it out because she took two and it was very crack addict. You take aluminum foil and you put the pill on top of it and you light it from underneath so it kind of melts and then you take a straw and you kind of do it like you're inhaling the fumes that it burns from chasing the dragon. Huh? Chasing the dragon chasing the dragon. They did it with heroin too. Why don't you just swallow the pill? Because I think you can get more out of it. Like I think it's a new smoking. It hits you faster, I think maybe should as you faster for sure. Gross people who are addicted are, can't even wait until the pill digests and starts to work in your body. You have to smoke it. It didn't, it didn't. It fueled a little, but honestly it was like more like, I think if I took Nyquil it would have been better. You know like or something like that. It wasn't to me it felt gross. And like definitely I have a good thing feeling when I do some drugs. I'm just like, you know what, that's just a stupid ass drunk. And that was totally one of those stupid ass dreads. Sued.

Speaker 1:          00:35:16       There was a crazy story that I ran across yesterday and I put it on the rogue board and uh, apparently it's been going around for a while. There's a dude on vice TV and he, uh, he interviewed this chick and she's on Youtube. She calls herself neuro soup. Have you ever heard of this girl? Yeah. She's the one who had a video about putting upper

Speaker 7:          00:35:38       abs right there. Like how long a trip went? Yeah. What comedy troupe is she in? She's not in a comedy troupe at all. It's a neuro soup is her youtube video that's on youtube name. So anyway, this, this dude Hamilton Morris is this, uh, the like the, the head psychedelic guy over@vice.com. You know, vice.tv or vbs.tv, the vice guide to Liberia. You know, those, those crazy travel guides, if you ever watched those, no. You are missing out on a chunk of crazy. These guys are fucking bad ass man. Yeah, they go everywhere. I mean Thailand, Thailand and pickup lady boys and shit. They go, they go to Liberia, they go to Liberia and they go to whorehouses in Liberia where it's like dollar where it's like sex is like a dollar and there's no windows to the place. They're like like oh like you know like cement huts.

Speaker 7:          00:36:30       Who are these guys do? They're bad asses and this this guy, Hamilton Morris is the psychedelic guy and he writes a all these articles about psychedelic and he interviews people and he interviewed this check and this neuro soup girl and this neuro soup girl, her name was crystal. She was living with this guy. She was a stripper, a golf stripper in Kansas and she was living with this guy who was like the number one LSD and MDM, a dealer in the area and this guy had a missile silo. He bought a missile silo, one of those and he bought like it got into like some underground nuclear bunker type situation. It's fucking place was radical. It's incredible. There's long as photos of it online. If you're looking for good advice.com it's Hamilton's pharmacopia getting high on crystal. If you want to just look for getting high on crystal, k, r, y, s, t, l, e, look for that online and following her on Twitter.

Speaker 7:          00:37:25       Yeah, whatever. So anyway, this girl, um, she, she hooks up with this dude and she stopped stripping and becomes this crazy psychedelic head. Like she's doing everything under the fucking sun every day of the week. She's just one day she's doing acid. The next day she's doing DMT. And these guys had DMT hooked up to ivs. They had it to up to ivs when they were doing liquid DMT and they had, they were regulating it on the ivy. So they were surfing the DMT dimension of, they were constantly getting it brought in their body and who knows what the fuck they did to their heads. But one, one of the guys started going crazy, her boyfriend and when her boyfriend decided that her, his partner was, uh, was doing bad things or was going to fuck them over, it was going to get him arrested. So he goes to the DEA.

Speaker 7:          00:38:11       These fucking guys have a missile silo where they're, they're dripping DMT into their veins and homeboy did so much, he brought himself to the DEA. So he turns his buddy end to the DEA. And then, you know, the, the dude who's the chemist winds up doing like two life terms or something like that, you know, he's fucked and they give him immunity. They give him immunity. So this is how our DEA ruts just fucking got, yeah, this guy who was just his probably just completely cooked. It's fucking brain. So he winds up traveling for free. I mean, he can, he's a free man. He doesn't have to worry about, he's not running from the cops. He winds up traveling the whole country while this is buddy is doing two life terms with this girl and all over the place. They're just doing insane drugs at every stop along the way until they get back and she's trying to get away from him.

Speaker 7:          00:39:00       She hooks up with another dude and the other dude is telling her like, hey, you know, we've got to turn this guy in like he's crazy, he's going to kill us. So they go to the Dea and the DEA tells the guy, hey, you're fucking girlfriend. And her new boyfriend just came and visited us and they told us everything, you fucking dummy, you better deal with that. So this fucking crazy man. It's crazy dealer guy that she, you know, the original guy, he takes them and locks them in a hotel room and dopes then and ties this dude up to a chair and it administers drugs into his dick and his balls with injections. And he did it for a week. It is the craziest story of just excess and chaos and just a complete insanity. Just chemical induced complete and Saturday. It's not like homeboy was probably crazy to begin with back when he was selling drugs out of a missile silo. But, but at the end he was guns Ville again. He was,

Speaker 2:          00:40:00       it was gone. I'm sure there's going to make it sound like I'm so lost in the story. How did you hear about this advice when a jerk, penis.com

Speaker 7:          00:40:11       I'll just let that set. There was a message board all about about

Speaker 2:          00:40:15       inserting drugs into your penis. No. Uh, somebody sends me on Twitter I think. I'm pretty sure we're, we're, can I see this? Like I said, it's on vice.com is this spice Dotcom, is this like 100% accurate like web, like story and everything? Cause this seems so ridiculous now. It's all documented. It's all doctors. I looked the whole thing up. It's a huge article. If you read the article online, it is, let me, let me go to it. I think it's like 10 pages. It's a really big and very deep. Seven pages. A very detailed article, but it all happened van. It's a pretty famous story. Isn't it weird though, when you hear things like this and you're like, nowadays you're like, this has to be fake. Like even when John know what you're talking about because this doesn't seem fake at all of them. Tell him that fake actually somebody kidnap somebody and the inserts fucking drugs into their penis and ask you to consider who you're talking about.

Speaker 2:          00:41:06       The Guy, the guy, the guy that did it is a guy that had already turned on somebody and so he'd had those nights of him on drugs. That's an awesome story. I got fucking turned on and I go fucking crazy. And then they come to him and tell him and that his wife's not only fucking some other dude, but he turned them on also. I don't know. That's not too far out of the spectrum. It's just weird that like some of these stories nowadays, it just seems so far fetched and amazing. But this isn't far fetched at all. This is this too to me. I know what you're saying, but this to me seems pretty, uh, pretty normal. Normal. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:41:34       When people start selling drugs, this guy was a dealing kilos of Crystalyn Mtma. He was just traveling across the country selling MDM and they were doing it constantly. Put that in perspective. Probably could for someone that's never done DMT, DMT, the BMA kilos Mtma is ecstasy. For. You don't know. It's the pure stuff. And that's what I heard. And what it is, is a, you know what it is? It's incredible. It feels awesome, but God damn, it takes a toll on your brain. Woo. The next day. I've never felt dumb, and I've heard that if you get really good stuff, it doesn't do that. But I call horse shit. It does it. There's a guy in college who, uh, who used to do a lot of ecstasy. I wish I could remember this kid's name. Everyone that went to college with me, I'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Little short hair with blonde hair.

Speaker 8:          00:42:19       It looked like a surfer. I look like mark Ahca Lupo the surfer, and then towards the end of college, like he used to have the saying for cigarettes borrowed. Bariums bariums he called cigarettes. Baron. Nerium. Yeah. But then we just realized he was so fucked up that he was trying to say Hemi. There was like a French cigarette, but it was, that was what he smoked. But he just came out of his mouth. [inaudible] I started going on him and man, I died to see what that kid looks like now. People that were really fucked up and go on Facebook to ecstasy really has taken a lot of people's brains. I've met many people that I know do a lot of ecstasy and they wind up completely fallen apart. It's so bad for you. I mean, I would venture to say that as a father of two I will, I will make the cover off statement and my children, all drugs are bad for you.

Speaker 8:          00:43:03       Don't do any of them because it would be nice to get to a Dane Cook place in life where you've never done fucking anything. What are you even talking about it like no, no, but I mean just to be like to be just sitting in bed and going on. I don't have to worry about fucking inhaling fucking glade as a child and wonder what that did to my lungs or, or you know, like cocaine or acid or ecstasy. Like when I'm having a panic attack in the middle of the night and I'm like, great, I did this to myself. Sometimes I feel that way. I go, if I had never done anything with any of this shit, be around, you know, I would love to tell me to tell my kids that, you know, be healthy. I'm sure you tell your kids the same thing. Yeah. And most certainly, but I just want to be real clear with them about what is legal and or rather what is dangerous and what is not and what simply illegal, right?

Speaker 8:          00:43:44       There's some reasons why things are illegal that don't make any sense at all. And it's a good lesson. It's a good lesson that the world is not structured correctly and you have to know that and always mind your p's and q's and everything is not as it seems to be because there's a whole, the system that we're operating under is fucking crazy. It's ridiculously flawed. And so I would make sure that before I got into anything, I would, I would let them know that. So don't always believe what you hear. And then here's what's dangerous. Here's what's addictive. Here's what's what's, you know, what's going to get you locked up in jail? You know, here's what's actually legal. Here's, you know, here's what's, you know, legal and safe. Here's what's legal and not so safe. You know? And by the way, don't do anything by yourself. Make sure, you know, you know what the fuck you're doing. Do it with people that you trust and only hang around people that you trust. You know, I thought, I find that people

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       that hang around with people that they don't trust, and it's really because they didn't have good relationships with their parents. You know, I, I'm going to try to have the best possible relationship as a friend with my kids as possible so that they'd never feel like they can talk. They can't talk to me about something and I want to talk to him about every step along the way of their life, you know? And I think that's what you're supposed to do. Yeah. The idea of drug scare the shit out of me, man. The idea of math or something like that,

Speaker 6:          00:44:57       but it was hot. I'm scared about like Oxycontin, meth, coke, coke. I don't want my daughters to get around that wall that stops the mushrooms even need like I've had, I've had friends, I'm sure I've said this a million times, but I've, I've done mushrooms and I've always had great experiences except at night when I see the shadow people. But I've never, like I, I would probably, we'll do them again as an adult because I think I've done all the exploring. I want to do, like I, I tried to do them one one night we were doing at Jamison tour, there's a meet a bunch of comics and um, we admonish mushrooms and I think we each took like a couple of caps and then I went on stage, I think I told you this and then I fucking lost my shit on stage. But then I started freaking her on mushrooms onstage at the Dallas Improv and all I could see as the candles in the back on. And I'm like, Oh fuck. And then I started thinking I can't get off the grid. Like I am responsible for people right now. Like, I am the fucking, and I'm not the kind of brain that can just dip into it and dip out of it. Like I'm responsible for humans. Like what if I fucked up? What if I fucked up tonight? And then I just was, I was cool. I fucking turned it around and it was fine and had a great night. But that's not the horror story, but that's a real moment.

Speaker 1:          00:46:09       You know that that thought as a father that's, so that's where things get really strange. You know, you think of these little helpless children that they're looking out for you.

Speaker 6:          00:46:17       Then again, you need the only one is not for me to see have a fun party night at a piano bar or somewhere in Dallas, but to, for me to like just read me a book. That's all we want. You know, and you just, and then that, then that grounds you and you're like, all right, that's where I'm at right now in life. I just need to get through tonight, drink myself out of this and fucking get to the other side myself out of this. I've done that so many times to move. I'll do that and amp system and a couple of weeks. Drink yourself in a dark, dense drink. Fucking yet black yourself out. Fucking worse than it is on the stone now how much do you say, what would you, what would you say your percentage of alcohol intake is versus marijuana intake

Speaker 1:          00:46:56       gap way, way, way more. We'd like give me a percentage. You drink every day? No. Like we're at dinner. Do you have like a glass of wine or anything? I sometimes do, but not every day. No. I find myself not, not, I've been drinking a lot more lately, but it's been like, no, I'll have wine with dinner or I'll have like a drink, but not drinking all night long. Right, right, right, right. Well that's certainly not good for you. But they've, they've done studies that have said, you know, whether or not this is true, they've said that, you know, having a couple glasses of wine a day is actually good for you.

Speaker 6:          00:47:25       Yeah. Yeah. I've heard to drink a beer every day or drink a glass of whiskey. Really for Ya.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       You know what it would do for you as far as relaxing you and I think, you know, it's good. It's good to enjoy your time. It's obviously not good to take a poison into your body, but if that poison, that alcohol poison, you know, if it's easily processed, which alcohol basically is, you know, especially like one beer for the average liver, it's no big deal. You too. I want to look at both. You just accidental. It's not much work for it, you know? And so it's a one beer can be processed pretty easily, but when you start getting into high, high numbers and then it gets toxic and then you're, you know, and then you're dealing with, you know, all, you're poisoning your fucking body. When you wake up from a hangover, it's, that's not an accident.

Speaker 4:          00:48:08       You, you're, you're, you're hurt. Sometimes you're like, I didn't mean for that to happen. You hurt yourself

Speaker 1:          00:48:14       for the booze, but you can have a little, not, not do that. That doesn't have to happen. Just gotta to know what the fuck you're limits are man. Drink a lot of water too.

Speaker 4:          00:48:22       That's the, someone told me they were like, you should put ice in your beer. I do. You used to do at beer, water, beer, water or drink, water, drink, water, drink. Like that was what I had to do when they go out. You know, I respect the fuck out of someone who can hold their booze. Oh, thank you. I can hold my to hold your booze. I get, when we calculated the last time you were here, you drink nine beers over the course of two hours. Those are nothing. Here's the problem. Here's where it gets tricky is, um, I also, you can't ever tell if I'm drunk. I'm like, no one can tell if I'm drunk. Like maybe you can. That's great. But like Mike Mow, my wife, perfect. We'll be in the middle of a fight and all of sudden she'd be like, hold on.

Speaker 4:          00:49:02       Are you fucking drunk? And I'd be like, yeah. So I'd be like, you've been fucking drunk. Does, does it? No, you don't mean any of this. And I'm like, well, you're still real retribution, whatever for, I think it just confuses people when they look at you. They're just, they just see beards and stuff, so they don't think you're drunk, but look at you with what does that lesbian dealing with a beard. That's the confusing part. That's a little late. On the flip side though, people also think I'm drunk when I'm not. Oh right. Like what? Like when I'm, when I'm on state, whenever I'm on stage I'll, if I'll bring up your on stage of me, you know, and I'll be like first beer of the night and everyone's like, whatever. Right. I was like, no, I'm okay. I guess. I guess maybe it's just being fat and they're like, he's been wrong.

Speaker 4:          00:49:38       Hold on. Well they think you're just telling a joke to, you know, instead of a declaration, which isn't funny. If you had had 30 already, then it would be Kinda, Kinda cute pair of the night. Yeah. I never come off drunk, but people always think I'm high always and whatnot. Yeah. Yeah. Like UFC, he's like, dude, Rogan's blues tonight. No, never, never do the FCI. How was the UFC and a huge, crazy fucking awesome. What's serious fights man, Frankie Edgar and gray Maynard. Did you see it now? No, but I tweeted that you said it was going to be fucking sick. Who

Speaker 1:          00:50:11       was the nuttiest rematch ever? The first fight that gray Maynard won the first fight by decision, but the second fight was a draw and it was a crazy draw because gray Maynard had Frankie Edgar badly, badly hurt in the first round and grain Mainers. A big guy. Frankie Edgar is one of the rare guys that fights his weight class. So he is 155 pounds. That's really what he weighs. Yeah, and he's fighting gray Maynard who's a really fit guy. He probably is 20 pounds heavier than that and diets down, you know, cuts his weight and cuts his water weight and everybody's like, like yield. He's sweet, he's way bigger. He looks like he's a dangerous dude and he's a power puncher and he hurt Frankie Edgar really bad in the first round of their second fight and like really bad. Knocked him down like three times. Look there.

Speaker 1:          00:50:50       The fight was over on several occasions, but somehow the Frankie Edgar rebounded. They came back and won the second round. It was chaos and then they battled back and forth to the bitter end and then you want to be in a draw. Well, this is the third fight. First round, gray. Maynard hurts Frankie Edgar a den bad, walks in with an upper cut. It looks like he's on the verge of getting stopped. Gray Maynard's present for just blast. And if he catches him a couple of times, has a badly badly hurt when he gets back to his corner the second round you're like, man, this kid might be fucked. Second round he goes up and just boxes and moves boxes and moves. Third round, same thing, boxes and moving boxes and then by the third or fourth round gray Maynard starts getting desperate. He's like, why can't hit this fucking kid again?

Speaker 1:          00:51:32       And he's charging after him and then they get at it in the fourth round and Frankie Edgar catches him with a punch and rocks them and then puts them away. It was chaos. Really ever. Have, I seen a guy get hurt that bad in the first round and then come back to knock the guy out like that in the fourth round. The fact that he did it in two fights that he came back from just devastating first rounds. Those first rounds take a lovable, you get beaten up like that takes so much out of you, and this motherfucker is so tough that he'd just gutted it out, got through that second round, kept moving, got through the third round. They had put it on him and the fourth was fucking crazy. Just a wild fight. Me and the whole place erupted. People were standing on their feet.

Speaker 1:          00:52:11       It was just a crazy, crazy fight. I never find myself being able to relax, watching MMA. It's hard. I mean, that's part of the fun sweating all of a sudden guys, it's not relaxing when it's an active viewing sport. Addictive issues. Yeah. It's fucking when you, when you find yourself, when you'd like, when, okay, this is a bad analogy, but when I was a kid, if I watch people, kids on TV, I would start air kissing like, wow, really? Yeah. My Dad would be like, what the fuck would you think about the one day someday you're going to be able to kiss some money. Yeah, but you nailed it right hand. Everything's stupid. That could have been done. I did, but when I watch MMA, I find myself going like, like twisting and turning my body, like uploading stuff. Sometimes I do that. Like if a guy's not tapping, if a guy's got something and then somebody got an arm bar or something, like I got like, I'll hold my arm, I'll grab my own arm. I got that. That tap tap. Come on. Do tap like I've, I've said it before when guys don't have, I'm like, come on man. Tap. Just tap or of the tab. Yeah. I don't want anybody to break their God damn arm. I don't want to see that fucking bowl photo. You fucking booze do without any fucking morning, Joe. I did. What I posted is,

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       it's a lesson that we all know, but some of us need to learn first hand. You Fuck with the bowl? You get the horns. A guy in Spain, a bullfighter got a gore. Oh, throughout a horn through his face where it came out. His eyeball to new one. It's a new one. The photo is just fucking amazing. I was laying in bed like I can go to sleep. I could wait. I'm just going to click on this little link. Joe just posted. Then I had to like go outside and have a cigarette and think about eyeballs for like 10 minutes and be back home. He lost his eye is the horn went through his entire face. It's fucking incredible, man. That's the problem. The animals man. You can't fucking tell him to slow down. Well, it's a bull. You're there fighting bulls is the dumbest fucking thing ever telling me. I got mauled by a bull. You did? Of course. Yeah. Yeah. I got mauled by a level. Of course I did travel network, but happen. I was just online. It's online. It's online. I'm burnt. The concrete or Herbert hurt. Bert, what was her burn? Her burn.

Speaker 2:          00:54:23       Aww. I love you. The um, Herbert was a show I had before birth. The conqueror is where I take dangerous manage jobs for a day. He's fought the MMA, the Gracies.

Speaker 4:          00:54:34       Oh, that's right. I thought that was from birth to conquer from her birth. And one of the days they call

Speaker 2:          00:54:41       like you want to be a rodeo clown. And I was like, I was like, not really. And then I'll come on, we're going to the Texas, he'll be a great fucking trip. And then I go thinking I'll learn something and they just tell me to show me how to put the makeup on and that's it. And then they just put me in the ring and they pull a fucking bulldoze. You can see it, you can see it so quick. Um, if you go to, if you type into youtube hurt Bert Rodeo clown, it just shows up and you just see my ribs get broken and I break my foot and then they go, what do they say?

Speaker 4:          00:55:06       Don't go to the wall. And then automatically I went right to the fucking wall. I was like, oh I do. I get out of here with broken ribs

Speaker 2:          00:55:13       was crazy. How crazy your life is really like you're, you're, you're no joke. Your and your documentary, is that going to go through all this documentary starts this weekend? Yeah. Starts this weekend in Tempe or Phoenix at stand up live. If you've been there, the documentary that you funded with kickstart funded with kickstarter.com mainly through this, through this podcast. Every listener that I guarantee every listener if you're listening, thank you so much for support. They're all I eat. I texted you, I think of the day everyone's international and I know that I had never been international so it's do this podcast. That's awesome. That's sweet. And your shirts are on their way and I got shirts, I've been wearing them to the listeners. Your shirts are on your way or wife is sitting there at the post office with boxes and boxes of shirts and it takes, she said it takes one minute per shirt and she has 3000 shirts.

Speaker 2:          00:56:04       So she's sitting at the post office and she had just has to give up after a few hours because she just can't stand any more per poor feet. And so then I'm thinking this is why the post office is going out of business. Cause she can't even spend money fast enough by shipping shit without it taking a fucking minute. His shirt, it takes forever. And I told her, I was like, I'll do it. And she's like, no. Can it take any shorter? I mean it seems pretty reasonable. You know what, you should be able to do, put a name on it. You'd be able to drop box on it and then send it across the country. Yeah, but you should be able to drop off all her packages that are already with the address and stuff. Drop it off and like, all right, come back in two days and then we'll give you the bill for it and amend the minute is probably filling out the addresses.

Speaker 2:          00:56:42       That's probably what it is. No, no, no. They're already filled out and everything. It's all about putting a stamp on it. It takes forever to like weigh. It takes a minute to put a stamp on that. She's got a high volume of things she's sending. But imagine if it wasn't for fucking ups or stuff like that. God, the world would suck. Well she's probably going through to save money. She's probably going through the US postal system as opposed to going to FedEx or ups where it would take, oh, and I'm saying is the post office look at your about to go out of business? Very, very fine. That sounds like a threat, don't you think terrorist? Don't you think that is? I think because of the Patriot Act they could probably arrest you now. They probably could. But you see that? Do you see that happening? I mean all my bills now are through my email.

Speaker 2:          00:57:20       Even when I go to the fucking bank, it sends my receipt to me. I heard you guys talking about that when I was in the bathroom putting my Rogaine on and I thought to myself, yeah, but how else are we going to get the shirts there? We need the boat. Of course. I can't just email. It can be private third parties that have more sense like, Hey, no, you just drop off all your shit and yeah, that's all you have to do. Yeah. UPS is so much, infinitely better than the point of the towns will never go to the post office. I, it's totally makes sense stuff. It saves you money, but yeah, it'd be like that. That's unfortunate that needless to say, the shirts are being shit that are sent being sent out. The biggest problem was because everyone in the second, you were one on the podcast, everyone below up, they're like, I want to fucking dope shirt. It is a total shit that people commented on it a bunch of times. I want it to Texas. I know, I saw that somebody tweeted like, awesome, how do you see you have a machine shirt? I was like, well cause come on. Seriously. How the fuck you asking that question? Monkey Todd.

Speaker 2:          00:58:16       God bless monkeys. Now you hung out with monkey Todd and there was photos posted and you are both not wearing shirts. I haven't questioned. Why don't you explain to people who'd look, he's a fan of the show. Yeah, he, he, he actually, he told Bert this whole story about his life about getting cancer and all this shit like that and talking about that. Oh, I might not want you to see your podcast kind of helped him. I helped him up with UFC tickets and sat right next to Ari. Yeah, he's a really cool guy. Really grounded. And I hung out with them for the night, like we not into the night we hang out. And then he was like, I got that role. He has a desk squad cat tattooed on his arm. That's crazy eyes. He's did the Nancy grace video. But every time you post photos you always have your shirt off. Is this something that you do, like when you're at a party, just to explain that Nancy grace video, you just glossed over what we talked about on the podcast before, but, but for purple people are just listening to this one. Just what did he do? He pretty much, he calls in shows and one of the shows he caught it and was TMZ. Nancy grace was on this show and he did like, who would you fuck marry,

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       kill? Uh, with me, Sam Tripoli and teat Jason Tebow. And uh, it got on the air and it did it that the producer director did not pull it either. They'd let it run. And so monkey Todd was just like continuing like just making it the most uncomfortable video ever and fuck you. And he confused it a lot. Like he talked a lot, he taught his method is talking a lot of jibberish so it's like what the fuck is he talking about? And then go on, so would you fuck marry, kill a red band, same Tripoli and Jason Tebow and and a he. So he did this and what's crazy is that Nancy grace was like the first time a TMZ was like, like we're going to have real guests now. We're going to start having yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:00:03       real guests now. And that's how they screw it. But that's how you're going to go live, man. If you're going to go live, that's just what you get. You're going to have Baba buoys once in a while. I love them. They make me laugh. It's hilarious when they get someone who's like a witness to something and they'd go deep, deep, deep into it and then they blah blah blah. Then you go, oh you motherfucker.

Speaker 6:          01:00:24       The other side of that though, and we've heard this a million times, is when you're trying to get interviews to get the fuck out of there and someone's like, yeah, yeah, Sandy was football rules. Fuck you and then runs off. You're like, damn it. I was so close to wrapping the day. Now I've got to do another human being.

Speaker 5:          01:00:37       I had something bad happen. I was stuck on the side of a road in Hollywood on Saturday and it had to pee really bad and, but I wasn't anywhere near a bathroom as a check point going on and stuff like that. So I had to pee. I found a mountain dew bottle that I was peeing in and pouring it out my my window, like I had to fill it up five times cause you'd be amazed how much p actually fits a mountain dew bottles. And this person walked by my car just jogging, like being healthy and she stepped in my pee and she just see, you're like looking down at the ground going, what did I just step off?

Speaker 4:          01:01:11       It's a story is so layered. I don't know where to start with. You know what it's like, it's like a Stanley Kubrick movie. It's not, what you're seeing is not what you're saying. It's all about symbolism and what the key represents. Brian's common sense says he's this leaking it out of his body. Like he can't get it out of his body quick enough. There's way too much common sense. Describe. He starts the story and I saw your eyes go, he's mad at me. Can you tell just mad at me today. I'm not mad at you at all. I just told you many times not to talk on the microphone like this because it changes a sa the volume of the podcast.

Speaker 6:          01:01:53       And so when I, when I brought that up, I felt you tense up. But it's just, I'm just telling Ya. All right. Flying Dildos. Tell me about this. Okay. This is the, this is, this is what you were talking about right before you told years. Damn. They keep her story. Can we smoke in here? Sure. So not that I smoke, I don't smoke weed, but I was just asking for you guys. So let me tell you, you want us to mark up. Um, so, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       so I'm going to wait to tell the story until you're

Speaker 5:          01:02:23       available. Joe. Someone has a Burt, you watched the South Park documentary last night, which was the most, which was one of the most amazing documentaries. And so glad that led fucking good. And one of the coolest things ever was that Trey Parker and Matt Stone, we're talking about a tripping on acid when they had to go to the Academy Awards and Matt Stone dressed up as a woman and was Trey's a date during the thing and they played clips on it. And it was so weird seeing, cause I had seen that interview before, but now seeing Trey Parker on acid, you could totally tell Joe is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. It's literally a here, give it back to Joe. Oh No, I don't smoke. You don't smoke? No, I don't totally defeated myself. We can get this to Joe. I gotta fix this camera roll

Speaker 4:          01:03:09       real quick. Run out real quick. Uh, oh here. Yeah. So, um, I told him if he did whatever process. So anyway, we have the south Pandosy documentaries fucking out of this world.

Speaker 5:          01:03:23       Yeah. That's documentaries. I was, I, I was thinking that, wouldn't it be awesome if they took,

Speaker 4:          01:03:30       can we get to the flying, build those first cause we might forget. Yes. Okay. Flying Dildos. Here we go. So I called Joe, this is what you said. You Go, we were just talking about this and you're like, yeah, you got so many crazy stories that have happened to you and it, and, and, and, but I never think that, I think there are just things in my life. I think it's my ability, the way I see something happen is different than the way everyone else sees it happen. You know? I see the, the little thing that, that registers and me, I go all, that's my thing, you know, and it lights up for me where my wife just glazes over it and it's come to light in this podcast more than anything. The machine. I mean, the way I've told the story to fucking a million people, but then when I told him to do something lit up and I went, Ooh, that is a good story, right?

Speaker 4:          01:04:05       The fucking fighting a bear, the fuck everything. I'm getting mauled by a bull, Tracy Morgan, everything's lights up. So then I'm talking on the phone today. I see you, hey, can you do by do and you go. I said, I'm on the phone with Delta, American Airlines trying to get upgraded. You're like, where you going? I said, Amsterdam. He said, I've never been there. I said, oh, whatever you do, if you ever go there, don't go see flying dildos. True story, right. So, so I'm fucking like 22. I'm at, I'm an in Amsterdam where with like five friends and there. And of course we do the rounds in Amsterdam and get fucking lit up a Heineken factory, hedge jobs, I think even maybe mushrooms. We walked by this live sex show and it says on the billboard, guy on girl, girl on girl, oral sex, uh, this, this, this.

Speaker 4:          01:04:52       And then the last one is flying dildos. Come see flying dildos since all Mike fucking, I tell everyone we're seeing fine dildos. I want to see fucking flying deal does. That to me is a showstopper. That is something that I will buy tickets for everyone for us. Why buy us all tickets? We go in and see a live sex show. Have you ever seen one? No. It's basically like, like half a boxing ring. So it's like you walk in and it's stadium seating and then half a boxing ring where they just without the ropes they just, everything happens right there. They just fuck it. Just fuck and Oh and our dudes beating off in the audience. Are you allowed to wear lipstick? No. Dude's aren't beating off in the audience. No, it's a, it is kind of creepy now that you say that because I don't know what we were supposed to do, but there was like 20 people in there, but we sat in there yet.

Speaker 4:          01:05:33       I guess maybe you should have been, but we didn't and we ruined it for everyone. So we sit down and they're like, they come out and they're like, the first is um, girl on girl. This is just like ut a porn, right? So two girls come out and they're like, they get, they got to eat and I s and just taken two girls come out.

Speaker 4:          01:06:10       How about how long is each one doing? Five minutes and fucking masturbating and meeting each other out and then blowing a dude and then the guy fucks a girl that's like the headliner, right?

Not going to make you look at 2011 in a positive light like yeah. That's how the future roles in strong dude. Obviously he's smoking oxies with Straw. Yeah. Come on. At what point do you put the meth and the light bulb and go little smoke it and see what happens? I tried it twice and it's like your, that's like a drug that you could actually take. It's not like fucking psycho drug. It's not like crystal meth. This is actually a pill that's for cancer patients or something like that, but it's opiates. It's heroin. It's heroin. You think? Well, yeah. Okay. Very good to be jump on your side on this argument, but I'm on Joe's page.

Speaker 2:          01:09:58       Oh, 100% it's heroin. Biddle level run a lot of pills and I've never taken an auction, but I've tried it. Two hits of probably a hundred hits that that pill gave off during the trial of the group I was with, so I took two hits of what other people were doing. Two to 300 probably hits for the whole night. Was that, wait, wait, wait about two to 300 heads and they were just pretty much puffing on the same pill over and over again. It was like, it was like smoking a whole bowl of weed or more, you know, it would think anybody give up 300 hits of Oxycontin and right now was probably over exaggerated. But his math is,

Speaker 7:          01:10:33       how crazy is that that you're willing to smoke something and if you smoked it 300 times in the road, fucking for sure Kelly, you 100% they'll go one you'll go to. But if you will got in 30 31 32 and then you got into 50 pretty good self control though. No, but I'm saying what I'm saying is when you're doing is if you took two hits, you know and you just kept going in really did what you said people did 300 yeah, he'd be dead. That's crazy that you're willing to take even two of those and you're like, you're willing to step two steps on the way to death. Two steps on the way to a 300 step way to drink alcohol. Yeah, sure. Same thing. I'm not, I'm not claiming that I'm above it. I'm just saying it's a fascinating thing called cause way more people fucking

Speaker 4:          01:11:18       drinking. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:11:20       Wait, you're saying you could drink alcohol and be fucking alcohol? Yeah. Alcohol doesn't get more people in the, he kills it. Well, don't get, don't get wrong. It tells a lot of people 100,000 alcohol Friday morning. I'll tell you, there's 300 million people in this country. Roughly around 80 to a hundred thousand people die every year from alcohol poisoning, from alcohol induced death, overdosing and alcohol. Um, and then there's more that die from drunk driving. That's, that's well over 100,000 that die from drunk driving. So that's, that's what you get attributed. The alcohol desk really, you can only attribute the, the poisonings though. The rest of it is just doing things that you can't control while you're drunk, which is, you know, it's still his death, but it's not, you know, it's not like an LD 50 rate. So it's like how many drinks would you have to have before you died? It probably not that many man. Probably even less than oxy. I mean we said 300 oxies would kill your 300 hits of oxy would kill you.

Speaker 4:          01:12:14       Exaggerating. I probably said they did like whatever. A bowl of really a big huge bowl of wheat cause I mean they were there for maybe an hour.

Speaker 1:          01:12:22       Okay. My point was how many shots can you, can you drink? You can't even drink 20 shots. You might be dead at 20 you might be dead. If you had to 30 you might be dead at 30 that's pretty God damn clothes. That's a lot closer than 300 you know? You know, sometimes you go five, six Deepa at night, so you're a quarter to weighted dead. Yeah. Ooh.

Speaker 4:          01:12:43       Are we talking about me right now? [inaudible] you're talking about human beings. No. Yeah, they're definitely. Here's the thing that's more dangerous about alcohol. Did any of that is I have a buddy who goes to Chicago, has a few bottles of wine, take some allergy medicine or whatever in the middle of the night. Wakes up pass like drunk stumbling, smashes through a fucking plate glass coffee table. Oh my God. Fucking destroys his face. Two kids. Oh No. Just having some wine. Fucking, I mean he was taking an allergy or cold flu medicine or whatever, but do you know, but he's a grown up. A lot of people have that old school growing up mentality with her. I'm a fucking grown up. I can take care of myself. I know I've done it a million times and you go, ah, fuck it. I'm good. I'm in a hotel room. What's I'm having?

Speaker 4:          01:13:24       I'm downstairs. I get in the elevator, go upstairs. What's the worse that can happen? But body falls to a plate glass fogging thing doesn't even know what he did. Just wakes up in the middle of the night base bloody calls his wife and she's like, I get you a first class ticket home and we'll have a doctor look at you tomorrow morning. Like what? That's the thing that scares me about alcohol, not the Dui, not the fucking liver shit. It's the fucking immediate, you know that. That's what terrifies me. Shit like that. Just a dumb accidents like you're drunk and you're naked and you're like, oh, suddenly a toenail breaking. Yeah, slip and I fall in the showers three times. Yeah. Not like you can get fucked up in a shower. Man. Rubber. That was just happened to meet the other day. I fell and I grabbed my stuff right at the last second, but I have a glass shower that door

Speaker 6:          01:14:12       and like it was really like I was looking at going like this would have ended really bad. That's why I only use curtains worse. It happens when you fucking fall in the shower with the curt and the here and then you're fucking on the ground.

Speaker 1:          01:14:22       Yeah, that's a good point. That's scary as fuck. Fucking terrifying. In the shower you can really, people die like that every year. I wonder what the numbers of that are there. Probably like pretty high. I bet it's a thousand people a year. I mean it's more than than whatever that drug was. 150 people die a year cause coconuts falling head.

Speaker 6:          01:14:41       You know what though? I started looking at the, had we had a palm tree leaning over our house and I started looking at palm tree fatalities. It's up there man. Like those or tried those limbs fall off hitch on the head. The trees aren't saddled climate, maybe two. I'll put those in there too. I don't care. But those things aren't deeply rooted so they fall over sometimes. Really? They're very bendable cause they're full of water but the, there aren't deeply rooted trees so they can fucking fall on houses easy.

Speaker 1:          01:15:09       So they just, you know you could be walking by and they'll just land on you.

Speaker 6:          01:15:13       A palm tree frog. Yeah. We have a dude coming to our house on Wednesday to get all our palm tree frons out and we got clean palm trees for like 75 bucks each tree. But you've got to give me up on that shit.

Speaker 1:          01:15:23       Do you guys say cut those things off your trees for yard? They usually typically gay people. Like is that a gay job to do? What? Tree cutters? None of that. Only specialize in palm. That alarm. What you say?

Speaker 6:          01:15:37       Palm trees, right. Wait, take. Took a break. The uh, I had, no, no, he's Mexican and he's a, he just came out and he's like, he, I got an email saying he needed to do survey the area and then he came out and he's clearly didn't speak any English and he was like 70 70 and I go, he's telling you 70 bucks. I get this real fucking complex email about him saying he needs to come out, surveyed the area, take a look at an appraisal after I get it. And he gets an appraisal to come back to me and he just comes out and he goes, 77, 70, 75, 75 70, right? I go a tree and he goes, sure. I go, perfect. And then he left. Didn't say any more than that, but yeah, that's the guy, Mexican guy.

Speaker 1:          01:16:19       So he climbs up, make sure those things don't drop on your head and kill you.

Speaker 6:          01:16:22       Climbs up. He's cutting them all out tomorrow or Wednesday that they're pretty fucking heavy man. Dude, they're fucking monsters. You were just tugged of ones and that easily could kill you. Ease it. You kill a child in a, in a heartbeat. Ooh. Yeah. That's why you gotta get that shit taken care of. We have one that hadn't been cut and like by eight years in our, in our front yard, that was our neighbors and our neighbor was like, and I was like, I got kids. Oh you playing in the front yard dogs, we can't have that. She had fallen down.

Speaker 1:          01:16:48       How weird is that? You have to worry about palm fronds

Speaker 6:          01:16:51       fucking yeah, I know everyone. Like of all the shit that was going to kill me that I was going to be a plane flight.

Speaker 1:          01:16:58       You keep talking about plane flights. Do you really freak out about playing fides? Fucking terrified. Do you think in any way, shape or form that all these fear and worrying about things puts a certain amount of energy out that attracts

Speaker 6:          01:17:10       negative things to you? I do, but I believe that. I feel like ignoring it puts out a taunting energy. Taunting what you're saying. I'm not scared of you bitch. You know what? Fuck it. I'm not scared of flying anymore. That's when God goes, ah, fucking see my rack. So you have the Catholic version of God where he has to fear you have to be or excuse me, where you have to fear him rather. Yeah. Will you tell him your secret? And he's like, yeah. He's like, well who the fuck you think you're talking? I'm talking about God right now. You want to talk about some gay shit. You talked to St Jude, that's who you talked to you. You don't talk to me about that shit. So you think that by not thinking about the plane crash by getting healthy about it, then it would be like you weren't respecting it exactly. 100% wow. What a crazy way to look at things. I have rituals for flying. I wash it every part of my body. Get all my hands and knees and say a prayer in the shower. Really? Fuck yeah cause I did it once and I flew back at by me is that was going on. I thought we fixed this.

Speaker 6:          01:18:07       Scoot out a little bit here. We fix this so he could sneak by me. Thank you. Got Bigger. Oh my, uh, just Fyi, my web guy put up something about the t, the shirts, the machine shirts on burp or burt.com they're taking preorders now we finally got the fucking licensing of the image. It's a fucking nightmare. Licensing of your own image was a nightmare. Yeah, because I didn't create it. It, same thing happened with my DVD. My DVD has a shirt with a carrot on it and it says hello. It's a joke I have about, if you're gonna put a vegetable, the girl's ass don't use a cucumber. That's like a home invasion. Use a carrot. That's more like a, a low. So then we couldn't get the licensing to the imaging. I wouldn't give it to us. He goes, now, I did it for the DVD.

Speaker 6:          01:18:49       If you want it, you give me like 20 grand. And I was like, I was like, all right, now we'll just won't ever sold this DVD. And this is an artist that did this as an artist, but in artists that worked for, uh, whatever, the company that distributed the DVD. Wow. So he just needs in a box you out. It was like, fuck it, you want it, give me like give me that. I think is offered was like 10 grand. I was like, I don't have 10 grand man. He goes, well you made, you know that you've made that do it. It's all in the shirts. Yeah. That's ridiculous. So then, but, but, but here's what happens is, so the guy, we did the documentary and he made the shirt, that machine shirt, and he did it as a favor to his friends took, we're doing the documentary.

Speaker 6:          01:19:21       So they were made specifically for the documentary. And then this is the documentary that you're about to shoot. Yeah. And then, and then, but I was like, Hey, can we can sell those on the road and, and the two group film guys are like, fuck yeah. You know, definitely will fulfill our documentaries. Those will be special shirts are not going to be all offered. That shirt isn't gonna be offered, you know, in the other color scheme. But yeah, totally sell it. And so we went, okay. And then the guy said, yeah, you make it a college can do whatever the one you could sell them. And then the artists, we had to come back to the artist and the artist was like, no. I was like, why not? He's like, because they're made for this documentary. I did it for friends, I didn't do it for you to go out and make a fucking fortune on it.

Speaker 6:          01:19:56       And so then we had to kind of negotiate to the guy and say, listen, you know, I'm not, you know, it was, it was a long process, very long process of everyone that seems like can hit the man, want you making any money, man. He's just like, yeah, and he did this for free, man. It's from my friends. You're not my friend. So then so other people want it, right. And then it won't be underground man. And then he's like, you know, so anyway, so we got him finally to say, if you want to sell it on your site or on on what you call it, you can do it and you know, negotiation shit. And so we just put it on Burp or Berta calm. But you can, you can order them, preorder them. I mean, I think all the fulfillments have to go out first and they're gone.

Speaker 6:          01:20:34       They're already out. But if you wanna go to burp her birth to calm, you'll find in the store, you'll find the machine shirt and you can now you can fucking stop emailing me about where to get them and when to get them there on how many emails you getting a month is a fucking nonstop. The day you warriors on a, on the podcast fucking a million people going like, hey man, I wanted to, I want to do anything in the documentary now. Like I didn't know what the shirt looked like. I was like, are you fucking serious? So

Speaker 1:          01:20:59       the documentary, the shirt is what got them to want to do it.

Speaker 6:          01:21:02       Uh, the shirt that's like, that's brilliant marketing the shirt man. But we would've never gotten the short made if we hadn't done the documentary. But isn't that funny that that works that way? That someone sees a shirt and it's a dope shirt and like this documentary is gonna fucking rule. Yes. Cause they see the shirt, but it's you, it's you. It's, I mean like don't, don't like undersell it. You're the first one, but you're being a regular human being. When you said as you go, you gotta get me one asap. Like I want to wear it on fear factor. I want to wear it on the podcast. So we rush it. We get it. A couple of sent to you, a couple sentences like other people that we know that are important to us and you wear it and it fucking blows up, like literally blows up.

Speaker 1:          01:21:34       Well that's uh, that's nice that I can do that. It's a pretty easy we'll have to do is wear a shirt.

Speaker 6:          01:21:40       Yeah. Or they feel like I did anything. You know, you just made a bad ass shirt. No chance to wear it. It's negative. Yeah. So yeah. So if you want to get, I'm gonna to burp her. Berta. Com. Bert, Bert, Bert with ease.

Speaker 1:          01:21:51       Powerful. Bert. Kreischer so what else, what else going on? I don't know what the fuck's Brian Doing? It's making video.

Speaker 5:          01:21:59       How, how sad are you about Steve Jobs? I, it hit me pretty hard or harder than what right. And it's harder then. No, but like when anyone dies, like when like Farley died, I was affected. I was like, wow, you know, I've really enjoyed watching Chris Farley. That was kind of like I was connected to him and I didn't know him. Steve jobs kind of same way. Like I effected me in a weird level and I wasn't sad. I didn't cry or anything, but I, it's pretty amazing looking back at like the videos of him giving speeches and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          01:22:30       Well, Steve Jobs was a bad motherfucker, but like all bad motherfuckers, he was flawed, you know? And um, he was a ruthless dude and did a lot of, uh, you know, with a lot of people would say is questionable shit. First of all, they had fucking slave labor that we're making the right phones. That's a, I mean, it's Chinese. These factories is Foxconn factories. They have to have nets all around the factories to keep people from jumping off the roof. You know, there's, there's a lot of weird Karma involved and stuff like that. And you know, I'm a total hypocrite because I have an iPhone, you know, I mean, I'm not a, I'm not boycotting these companies that use

Speaker 7:          01:23:05       this, this kind of labor, but I mean, it was pretty public. They had, they have nets around these places to keep people from jumping off the roofs. They work 15 hours a day and they sleep on cots and it's fucking gross, man. It's gross. And it's scary that people can be forced to live like that. Just to survive in 2011 is open that he, do you think he knew that? He fought for sure. Knew it. He knew that he was aware of every single aspect of every day to day operation at Apple. He was incredible CEO. He's a guy who is completely dedicated and, and, and, and love with every facet of his company. And he was just a bad motherfucker. He had to have know where they're being made. If I know where the fucking phones are being made, he knows where the phones are being met and this ridiculous, it's a ridiculous to think he did.

Speaker 6:          01:23:50       No, no. I know Megan is also, they fucking claim that the, I didn't know there was child labor, like I didn't know that. You think they knew it.

Speaker 7:          01:23:56       Yeah. He's also incredibly ambitious and the reason why the company became so good is because he was so ruthless and incredibly ambitious and because of that, you know, he was, he was a tough guy to work for for some people. Some, some people will tell stories about him yelling and screaming at people and calling a maze. But that's because he wanted so much of himself and the reason why he was such a bad mother fucker, he's had these incredibly high standards. So then to have all these other people working under him and some of them who he didn't feel like met his vibration, met his frequency. He would be upset, at least as far as everything I've ever read him at him, he just seems like another tortured, brilliant person, you know, who had an incredible gift of vision for this computer company. You know? I mean I, I, like I said, all bad motherfuckers are flawed. You can't get to be amazing at something. You know what? Remember when Clinton got busted pulling his dick out and we were all like, ah, there's a part of us that, it was like, it was a breath of fresh air. There was a part of Clinton getting caught getting his dick sucked in the White House was like, okay, no one's got it all together. No one does. Not even the fucking president.

Speaker 6:          01:25:02       No. Wait. Do you believe, how about this? What about this theory? I was just saying this to Brian today in the car ride. What if, what if the, what if the flaw shows up when you get there as opposed to it's always there. Do you think there's an inherent flaw that shows up with guys like Steve Jobs when you become Steve jobs and you walk into a room and everything you say is

Speaker 7:          01:25:20       what's not really a flaw? You know what I mean? Look, it's, it's just a quality and is the quality of Steve Jobs was that he was just, his vision was much clear, has his, will was much stronger. His, his ideas carried more weight. He just knew how to put it all together and do it. He had a, uh, a pure vision of what he wanted the company to be like. It's not, there's not, that's not a bad thing. You know, those, these, this obsession is just how he chose to live his life. He chose to live his life in this obsession for excellence and the, in the end, we're all temporary man. In the end, we just ceased to exist. We're here for a short period of time and then we're gone. If you want to live it like that, man, you want to burn that candle a birth at both ends and make a big when it reaches the middle, why fucking not w what? What is the difference? Is it, is it better to die slowly? What I don't understand. I don't know. I don't understand. I think a guy like that that comes along and just [inaudible] and makes this big, incredible explosion. That's a pretty fascinating individual, but you know, I think it's important to look at them as honestly as possible. You know, like anybody who died,

Speaker 6:          01:26:27       it's funny. I'd never heard nothing but nothing, but absolutely like he's a god. He changed everything and to hear their perspective, I never heard it that way. I never saw it that way. At least this comes from a fan, you know? I don't take you as, I think you're being more objective. It was like I talked to my dad about the Wall Street occupation today and I was wondering where his perspective was going to come to. My Dad's. My Dad's like you in the sense that he's like, there are things I'll say to you sometimes when I'll go, oh, I think Joe Joel believe this. And then I say it to you and you go, are you fucking retarded? And then I go, but like, but my dad's the same way. My Dad's a regular dude who by the way, she'd be on fucking Alpha brains, but really?

Speaker 6:          01:27:04       And my dad wants to do alpha brain so bad. He's like, please send me some and I will document it. And my dad said that to me. Oh my dad fucking asked about Alpha brains and was like, watch, assign it to him. Brian. I don't even have alpha. Right. And I ran out like, today's just some dude. But um, but yeah, but, but the, we were talking about the Wall Street occupation and I was like, I was like, I don't, I don't know where to fucking like, I like Jamie Kilstein and I know he's like at the head of the New York one, but occupy Wall Street occupy,

Speaker 7:          01:27:29       I think it's a great idea to scare the fuck out of those corrupt cons. Yeah. But what's going to happen? Thing 90% of the people are just there for a party. They're just there for

Speaker 6:          01:27:38       a big protest and intimidate. And Neal Brennan, I think it was just did a standup comedy for occupy la I think. And I'm like, now they're having comedy shows. This is pretty sweet. This could be like the next, you know, let's try it.

Speaker 7:          01:27:51       Wunderman look last this cause he, how it starts, you know, we're joking around about this now. Like it's no big deal, but look, essentially what keeps a country together a government and essentially the Internet has exposed the fact that our government is absolutely corrupt and absolutely incompetent and almost every single way, and not just corrupt, but corrupt to the point where they're starting wars for no fucking reason for profit. And that's pretty well been established. And if that's been established and there is no government, we just don't got a bunch of corrupt cont criminals that are running the fucking people into the ground and they have this fake system, this fake monetary economic system that's just fucking built on unfixable bullshit. Just a porous fibrous. This. There's no fixing it. It's, it's impossible to shore it all up. You would have to completely start from scratch with a whole new thing and dissolve all the money, which is fucking never going to happen.

Speaker 7:          01:28:44       You know, in a lot of people get mad when I started talking about economic things. They go Joe Rogan, you know him, know nothing about economics. And you know what? You're absolutely right. I don't know nothing about economics, but I do know bullshit. I know bullshit and lady, it has. I've been how, how I've been explaining as it's been explained to me the, I know it's bullshit. You know, it's bullshit too. It's not even based on goal. It's based on fucking confidence and it's run by [inaudible] and if that's the case, what is going to happen eventually? We'll fuck man, this shit my fall apart. It really might fall apart. Well, we're enjoying right now this calm and chaos is like us being taken care of by our overlords. US being taken care of in our slave quarters and we're like dealing with it. But when we asked to be free, man, we may, we better be ready. We better be ready for whatever the fuck that means. I'm ready. Not even close, man.

Speaker 6:          01:29:31       If would've ordered Wall Street just walked out and occupy Wall Street and they're like, fine, you guys take over.

Speaker 7:          01:29:35       Yeah. They'd be like, hold on. Where's the lighter? How does anybody ever gonna figure out what money is again? I mean obviously they could never walk away, but, but how is anybody gonna to refill in our lifetime? It would take so many lifetimes happen, I think. I mean, I would imagine, and people who are rich right now are never going to accept it and people will owe people money or never going to accept that person owes money and now they don't anymore. We'll fuck you, man. I gave you that money. He never paid me back. You douchebag. Now once we figured out a new system of government, you better give me my money back. You know, there'll be like old debts that people are gonna want to bring into play,

Speaker 6:          01:30:08       but it's, but you know, I understand what they're saying in a sense that that we tried to apply for a home loan this year and it was a fucking nightmare. Like getting a home loan. They have this money, they can give this money and they choose not to for ridiculous reasons. And so fucking like, I understand that in a lot of it. I do believe that is the small businessman that keeps America afloat. It's not the corporations.

Speaker 7:          01:30:33       Well, you know, corporations don't hurt as long as they pay a good wage and they have union labor and they take care of everybody. But I don't mind the corporations. Obviously people start going on about, you know, uh, you know, unions want too much money and that's why corporations have to go down to Mexico and they forced these jobs overseas. Like, or is that really the only fucking solution? Is it really the only solution to get people to work for slave labor? That's the only silly to get people to work for some ridiculous wage that you would never, I, it doesn't make any sense to me. We always manufactured things. We've got to figure out a way to manufacture things here. And does that mean that they cost more money? I don't. Maybe, I don't know. I don't know. But figure it out. Don't use fucking slave labor, man. You know? I mean, I'm such a hypocrite because I do have an iPhone and I do know about this Chinese company that makes iPhones, but really at the end of the day, man, you're attached to that in one way and some form you're, you're connected all the way back, you know, to these people wanting to jump off a roof to make your fucking cell phone. Is there a way to make cell phones and America, Brian, you would know this. Can they do that? Can they just start making an iPhone

Speaker 6:          01:31:34       be more expensive, more expensive? $20,000 yeah. I mean, these people are beginning Peyton, nothing. You know what? Before this company was there, they're probably laying on the ground shivering with snakes coming out of their asshole. You know, who knows

Speaker 7:          01:31:51       Casey resign as the companies, the countries. We're all fucked up before it was before. Yeah. Well you know, you've got to put good point there, but with these South American countries especially, you know, yeah. These, these

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       poor Fox, they were tearing down their rain forest and put an oil fields out there and ruining their, their land.

Speaker 2:          01:32:05       We went in with our clothes and our all our shit, all that east western Shit and dumped it on them and said, this is the way it's going to be like, you know, I mean look at, look at, you don't expect to see a guy improve wearing slacks and a collared shirt and a fucking tie. But we said, do that shit. We cut your re enforce down, we're ready. Join the team. And then we're like, oh by the way, it's a nickel a day and you've got to live in a cage.

Speaker 1:          01:32:28       Is it even possible that we could come up with really efficient robots that do most of the work and have the, the phones and all these fucking things made in America and pay people an honest wage and instead of a phone raking in $800 you know, making a, you know, what if they have a phone that they sell for 800 bucks, like what is the profit for them? You think, uh, that was a problem for apple book is 70% 70% you think along with manufacturing and all that shit. Do you think it's that high? I think it was pretty high. Livwell we're, we're totally speculating, right? And I'm too lazy to Google this, but, so let's just for the sake of this argument, just pretend it's 70%. Let's go with what you say. So they make a 70% province. I'm inclined to think it's not that high because I'm inclined to think that with production costs and then with advertising and apple spends a lot of money on

Speaker 2:          01:33:16       yeah, but an iPhone right now, they sell retail price, like the new iPhone four s I think as $899 for the cheapest version without a contract or something. It was either seven or nine or nine or eight 99 $400 for a new upgrade. I know that my wife just looked at it today,

Speaker 1:          01:33:32       but if you want to buy one f flat out, well you know, and then you've got to well, either way. Okay,

Speaker 2:          01:33:37       so do the 70 you think an iPhone really costs that fucking watch? No. You know that shit screen is so cheap. They have fucking screens. They have what? A $20 Indian, a laptop right now or an iPad that just was released. It's like $36 I think it was to buy. No, I know what you're talking about. Those are her children to learn the alphabet. Yeah, but the screen size is way bigger than the iPhone. What I'm saying is the parts they mass manufactured there. They're definitely using this cheap labor and stuff like that. I bet it is something like a 70% profit, we'll say, but I'm going to, I'm going to just jump in for $200 really? I'm not going to justify it $100 but let's, we're not, I'm not talking about the dudes who had paid to make this. That's not what my, where my money's not going to those those 20 Asian dudes that put the phone together. I'm talking, my money's going to the guy that made it, the guy that fucking said, this is how we do it. You can't pay that guy $5 an hour because he won't do it. You need that 800 offset of 70% profit where Steve jobs has got a a dialogue.

Speaker 1:          01:34:38       Jobs at the end of the day has $7 billion in the bank and his body fails. All right.

Speaker 2:          01:34:43       Yeah, but think of all the fuck [inaudible] think of all the companies that did not exist, like the Macintosh or the, the, the myths Chubashi Hand Gel. You know, like the one, the, all the phones that you've seen that you didn't buy right

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       there. Just fucking keeping their head above water. Steve Jobs, just having to come up with the sexiest one that all of us, despite sometimes our moral beliefs when I fucking want the phone, like in a way, never thought about anything other than wanting the phone until I found out about the factories. But even still after the factories, did you switch over to whatever the Google one? They tried it, but it was 10 and so that, that's my point. That's my point. You Go, one's probably made the same way. Make them in other countries. They make them in Mexico. I'm not saying yeah, but my, my, my point is, it's not that he deserves his 7 billion, but the point is he did do a magic trick. They got us all to fucking, even despite knowing what we know about how they're made, we went still fucking with the phone.

Speaker 4:          01:35:38       Here's the question. It, would it be possible to do the exact same thing but do it in America and instead of him making $7 billion, he makes four. How's that? Is that possible that you could have done it exactly the same way and everybody makes a shitload of money but you, you spread it around more. Is that possible? But it is possible for a Steve jobs to do it, but it's not possible for the guy that did the Google phone because the guy that did the Google phone would not only be broke but everyone would be fucking broke. Like you know you got, it's like, so you're saying once it becomes, he's had some things out there on the market, he's hedging his bets. The guy that made the Google phone probably just made a nice living, didn't make the 7 billion. Well, you know, it's a, first of all it's Google.

Speaker 4:          01:36:20       You know, they have, they have their own phone operating system and they, you know, I mean it's not like a guy. I know. I know, but I know, but I'm trying to, I'm trying to a broad stroke it or like a whatever the other fucking phones are out there. The smartphone. So you're saying they can't make them in America. They couldn't make them at a more reasonable profit in America. Uh, if they did, if they had and they said, okay, well instead of best case scenario, instead of us being up mass hit like the iPhone and we all walk away with 7 billion, we're willing to walk away with 5 million each. Right. Well, when it isn't, when he's just average the way it was, they were all lost their asses. They would have all look like the deficit, the deficit we're looking at there is totally different.

Speaker 4:          01:37:01       In my opinion. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about Joe. I'm pretty fucked up right now. Okay. But I'm saying, I'm just saying like you're losing me. No, I'm saying I see what you're saying, but I don't think that they're losing venture making droid phones, especially these really bad ass ones. They may like the, you know, the HTC evo is and the droid bionics, the Motorola bionic, whatever. I don't want that shit. What do you mean? I don't want that. I want the iPhone cause I saw a dude have one on a plane one time and I went, I went that shit. So whatever that thing you did created is, makes me want it that in a weird way, you earn your 7 billion. Oh yeah, yeah. I mean in a weird way. Yeah. You know, look, he created a cult, you know, the cult of Mac and I'm a, I'm a user, you know what I mean? So like I said, I'm a, I'm a huge hypocrite. I thought, I think they have the best operating system. I'd love it. It doesn't crash. I never get viruses. I have no issues. It's a little more expensive. Yes it is. You're writing jobs didn't die from the virus. Joe.

Speaker 7:          01:37:56       I want you to go home.

Speaker 6:          01:37:58       You listen to spot weird energy. I agree with what you're saying. I, anyway, side note. Uh, I just think that, I think that they probably weren't set up originally to try to make 7 billion. They were best case and I was like a million each and then Josh blew the fuck up. And you're right when that guy, there's a lot of stories about him doing business. It's totally stupid. Well, but once you get to that place where you're the dude that made the sexy thing that everyone wants and you're the God that created all this fucking microcosm of belief, of cult of personality about you, you start believing what the fuck you feel and you go, fuck it. I'm indestructible and you're right. I do believe that it's Karmic energy that snapped back on him from all the negative shit he put out there. But I didn't,

Speaker 7:          01:38:36       well, I'm not saying that. I don't think that's why he got sick. You know? I think if, if anything, you probably got sick cause he works too much. You know, I think when you and your that type of person that can't turn it off, man, that's an incredible amount of strain in your system, your red line in your system all day, man. When you're like a super intense success oriented, goal oriented, victory oriented, sort of a guy like Steve jobs. I mean, he wasn't just a visionary man. He was like a cult leader. He created a cult and didn't even ask anybody to join the cult. They just joined, but he just joined it, followed it everywhere and I would have conversations with people at work when I was on news radio. This is, I realized it would, they would be like super excited about Apple's new announcements and the attack. Talk to you about the new announcement here. Apple's new announcement. Yeah. Yeah. They're working on the Osx right now and then they get now it's crazy. It's like that now for real. It's like Hari Krishna Shit, you know?

Speaker 6:          01:39:25       I mean, think of a guy that's basically a stand at a podium and go, everyone do me a favor right now. Throw away your fucking phones and everyone just going, I want the next thing he's got. That's what we all do. Right. He just stood up there and like fucking take the purple

Speaker 5:          01:39:37       lemonade or whatever. I think of what it is though is a lot for me. Creativity. I've never in my life ever been able to take what I'm thinking in my head and put it out exactly how I want to put it out. He created a tool. He created a hammer, he created a brush. He created something completely different and then sometimes I think people look at what he's done is create something that never existed before, which was taking what I'm thinking in my head and putting it into a format that I could show you what I'm thinking. You know, like create creativity has never been done before. Since I've got an apple, you know like using like final cut pro and all the programs that he's given me, I'm now really feeling like, like, like it's a tool like a hammer. Wait,

Speaker 6:          01:40:22       are you understanding this? Because I can sort it, I can translate. I was saying that it helps them create, well, I mean, think of Brian Brian Base. Think of Brian, you know, 10 years ago before apple was around the jawline dude sitting on a guy sitting in a room with a bunch of ideas that he wanted to come out. He wanted to do when I'm using two VCRs to try to make a movie where now I'm fucking filming on an iPhone doing HD and Adl and arguably you are a much more successful human being today than you were when pcs were around. Your ideas can happen quicker, faster and you can get them to more people.

Speaker 8:          01:40:54       Think of the voice as interesting as it had been today, how many people has gotten too just because of apples and Max. I mean that's, I see what you're saying. I mean it would've, we would've gotten most of it done with windows. I mean, I don't, I don't, I disagree. Yeah. I mean, I've used pampers before and it like, really? I could get my, my, my emotions out there, but it's not the same as like, if you look at it not be the same, might not be as good. But Dude, there's a lot of people who edited videos and did a great job and they edited them on pcs. You know, there's a lot of Photoshop PC. It's what I'm saying, PC, when you're talking to him, all the jobs created the first PC. Yeah. But he didn't create the Windows operating system and Xerox have computers put the PC.

Speaker 8:          01:41:36       Xerox already have the graphic user interface before apple did. I'm pretty sure they did. I'm not sure they got a good idea from zero. You ever heard of a xerox personal computer in your life? Do I have it? But they could have existed. You know what I'm saying? I mean, it's like, and we know that windows did and we know that a bunch of different people make windows computers. I think computers would exist in some form no matter what. I think once the technology was introduced into the world, it's just a natural chain of progression that people automatically start incorporating into their lives and then it becomes better and better. What apple was was the best one, right, but it's not like the computer wouldn't exist if it wasn't for apple. What apple was was the best, and by the way, Wazniak was the technical genius behind that.

Speaker 8:          01:42:13       It wasn't even Steve Jobs. It would have existed, man. Computers would have existed, but no doubt about it. Apple does it the best and they do it. The sexiest you're hitting on Steve Jobs, man does is on a Mac. This is a Mac to your left. You're going to Mac over there. I bought all these bitches. I know. That's what I'm saying. Why you hating on Steve Jobs not hating on him. I'm just trying to get the Steve jobs loving and you're like, what am I talking? All I said was that he's a ruthless dude and that all bad motherfuckers have their flaws and you got to look at him for who he really is. Not very isolated.

Speaker 8:          01:42:45       Did you say I sad. I'm so, did you say I'm not very, I said, that's hilarious. Give me some hilarious. I said, that might be, then let's the line of the night, you know, like, I can't wait to see in like four or five years when Steve Jobs plans, I've run out. Like I bet there's a couple of that they just threw in there like, oh, he didn't really perfect this idea yet. Like smelly computer. Now I don't want to see like just taking all the ideas that you put down on paper and they're like, guys, it's a helicopter. I helicopter. Yeah, we're all going to have them one day. So wait, can I, can I, is this possible that I just, just with the energy that we're having today, can I ask how you guys met? Oh yeah. I met Brian Online. Brian was on my message board. Yeah. Well, Brian was posting these videos. There were super creative. That's good. Brian's best. Dot. He's a wizard video editor. I mean, even if it wasn't a room, I would say for real. He's a weird guy. You know, obviously you can tell he's a very silly, silly man. He's, but because of that, he has a sensibility when it comes to video editing that I've never seen before. It's, it's so, and so,

Speaker 7:          01:43:52       uh, his, his sense of humor is so his, and you're fucking great at a man. You really need to make more videos, not just like little like edit videos because they're fucking amazing man. And so I met him, he was doing these videos just for a goof and I was, I met him at one of my shows and he was on my, my message board all the time. And I said, what do you do for a living man? He said, he works for gateway computers and like, you want to work for me? And he's like, yeah, I'm like, come on out to come fucking California. Which is curious. Yeah. So he came out to California and that's back in the comedy store days where, uh, Brian used to film crazy people coming up to us. It was always like one fucking crazy retard after another. Brian would take these videos and make these hilarious little things out of them, little clips. And, um, that's how we became friends.

Speaker 2:          01:44:38       So interesting. I always wondered about that. I thought I was having a much more romantic story. You never is the I love good. Hey, by the way, I'm still mad at people hating on restaurants that are like chain restaurants. Like, like I went to the olive garden last night and had the best meal ever. Another fucking impromptu all garden. Here's what [inaudible] going to go to. And by the way, check this out. Worst segway guy. There's a Sushi place in studio city that has this famous Sushi thing called, I think it's called Sardo's or something. No, it's not sorry guys. But some other place, Katina or something Qatar. And they had this like all you can eat Sushi thing for $26 right? So my girlfriend's like, oh, I went to Sushi and I'm like, all right, let's get Sushi. So we sit down and then we were like, all right, we'll have the all you can eat Sushi do.

Speaker 2:          01:45:23       And so we ordered three, two, she's, and they give you like the mungus thing of Sushi. So it's not like, like six roles. It's like 12 rolls each. So I'm like, Oh shit, this better be good. It's all rice and Raul, mushy fish. So in Beta, same thing right now. Keep going. Fuck does this have to do a little, we were talking so, so we start eating it and then we're like, this is disgusting. And the woman comes over and I'm like, Hey, this is gross. And I'm like, sorry, you have to eat at least a 75% and I'm like, what? 75 Pr. Alright. And my baby, I was like, I'll eat it, I'll eat it and we'll get something else. It will be better than, than this shit. So I ate all of it and then I feel like I'm gonna Puke. Right? Like it's the worst Sushi ever.

Speaker 2:          01:46:03       This is the one that you can tell how ridiculous Brian Stories are. How many likes there are in there. Yes. And so like, and she's like, and he's like, and I'm like, oh my God. Like, so my girlfriend's like, I feel sick. Can we stop? Can we, can you just, can we pretend we're doing the directorial element element on this? So wait, my favorite part is when the lady says to him, you have to eat 75% of it to even have this conversation. He goes, don't worry. I got this. I'm going to be 75% of the Sushi and I, I ate the whole thing because I was just trying to prove a point. Right? Like this is bullshit that you're forcing me to eat this horrible Sushi. Probably have to get rid of it for it. Right, right. I know. That's what I'm thinking. I'm thinking the same thing like that and then my genius.

Speaker 2:          01:46:42       I'm glad you thought of the same thing. I told the waitress, the waiter to come back and I'm like, look, my girlfriend feels sick. We don't even want to try for any more Sushi because this is awful. I'm sorry. You have to eat it. You know what's the point of the story, man? Was there a point? Yeah, because I went to the olive garden and guess what? None of that shit ever happens at the off guard. I'm not sitting there disappointed. I'm like, no, this salad is awesome. These breadsticks are awesome. This is awesome. This is awesome. This is often the point of this whole side track is that all of Golf Garden, all you can eat pasta and everything costs me $40 that shitty ass Sushi, 51 bucks. Who would want to listen to this?

Speaker 2:          01:47:21       You realize that this is a podcast who the slug would want to listen to you talk about how angry no, Brian, I'm being honest with you. This is, this is, this is a product. This podcast has a product that I take very seriously. I really love doing it and if you actually, and people enjoyed it very much. No, I did not ask you. You went off on a wild, crazy chase to tell me that there's places that are bad restaurants in the olive garden always gives a quality. You know what I'm thinking? It's like people that get that bash on franchise record about that. Forget about that. What I want to know is, are you, you know, people except perfected this shit. People are listening to this, entertaining in that. No, definitely. So when people say mom and pop restaurants are the only way to go.

Speaker 2:          01:48:00       Like I this, this restaurant is good because it's owned by small family. There's need to go there and you just have worst horrible, shitty ass. Right. Bryce service is a dumb conversation because not every mom and pop restaurants sucks. No, but the majority of them are. That's not true. That is true restaurants Brian. That is not true. That's why they have kitchen nightmares cause all these places can't make money. So there's like this, they're more likely to go under because the bad restaurants and occupy Wall Street. Okay. I'm going to be judge Judy right now. You are right on the part of what you said and you were writing on the part of what you said your role in the last part. What my mamma's shit. Pop shops are good. I know. No, I'm not saying they're not. No, no, no, no. You're wrong. You're wrong.

Speaker 2:          01:48:41       And the fact that no one wants to hear what you just told us, however shows chose all on the fact that what it is then turned interesting cause it was so bad because it was so bad. So bad in a genius way. Cause I'm sitting here laughing, going, I can't believe that we're, I think it's important to remind everybody that someone's listening. This is, ours is a program. This is entertainment program, and just get apologetic for edit stories. It doesn't go to stores. I apologize for talking. Not Describe. Aspire to a higher level, sir. No, you guys are, I'm laughing. I'm having a good time. This isn't even remotely uncomfortable. Joe, why are you so uncomfortable right now? Dude, you're being weird. Despite that, I can feel angry right now and I'm not you. You've been awkward this entire podcast. I'm always awkward, every podcast, but this is extra. No, it's not. It's just, it's on the same as drinking beers with Bert Kreischer. It's about right. I'll stop drinking. Guys. I may switch to energy drink because I feel bad now because I'm making Joe Awkward. Well, Brian, you mean you, are you happy with that story? How that all turned out? Well, obviously, obviously

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       it was a little bit more intense than I thought it was going to be. A talking about how I like going to a franchise restaurants because they do it right and they've figured it out. They get service, good food compared to go into getting food poisoning.

Speaker 1:          01:50:02       The be honest as a person who likes listening to podcasts as a person who enjoys quality conversation, where you happy with that? How'd that turn out?

Speaker 5:          01:50:12       Not your reaction, but I was happy at how my story with the story with the end result of the story just answered. I apologize for bringing up the guys. Are you happy with how the end result of the no, definitely not. I'm not having outlets ending right now. I did not mean to to turn into whatever happened.

Speaker 1:          01:50:30       No. And Are you happy with it as a product? Like it was a piece of art as a conversation, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you say that in retrospect it wasn't that entertaining? I think you're taking it different than what I, I'm just, I'm just trying to find out your, the way you approach it, the way you approach telling a story. If I, if I'm telling a story, I want to make sure that it's entertaining and if I think it's not going to be entertaining, I don't want to tell it. I think that's what you have to do. And if I tell a story in it and we all have, and it's not that entertaining, I feel uncomfortable. And you don't seem to feel that when you tell a story and it doesn't work out that good, it doesn't seem to bother you at all.

Speaker 6:          01:51:03       Okay. Sorry. Does that make sense? Yeah, but, but, but I'll argue once again to be the, okay. Um, I will say that I think, and I don't mean no offense by this, but I think me and you have a higher threshold, like a, a titer threshold of when our stories aren't doing well, where we get more uncomfortable as a performer. But he's been not, it hasn't been doing it. What, 27 years and 15 years he's been doing it a hand like six. So I think our threshold, like when I bomb, I know what it feels like, like that. Like, I think, I think he's hoping it's, I can't believe we're talking about this, but he'll be, I think

Speaker 5:          01:51:43       I thought we were just off. No, no, no, no. I think I didn't know different directions.

Speaker 1:          01:51:49       Change the conversation in the middle of this conversation went to this weird olive garden thing and you bring up the olive garden.

Speaker 5:          01:51:56       Are you against the other guy? Because I'm not getting paid by the olive garden. Is that what you think I'm talking about? Like I have no connection to the gardening and this just start dating. I am sorry for bringing up the olive garden. I will change it to Applebee's.

Speaker 6:          01:52:08       I'll tell you what. Or if you guys want, I'll tell you about the time I did. The girl that had cerebral palsy. What's that like? I don't know. We'll just see if that goes somewhere. I don't know. I'm not certain, but I didn't know stream. I didn't know pretty extreme. Patrice O'Neal was, uh, was like, it's fucking obvious. I don't know how you didn't see it. Whoa. But I didn't see it cause I was drinking so much around her that were when you met her? Yeah, we were on a plane. Whoa. Flying from La to New York and I beautiful girl sitting next to me and I just automatically, whatever thoughts you're going to have her overwhelmed by how hot she is. She was like, Angela, Angelina Jolie meets a Sarah Michelle Gellar really smoking hot. And so, um, so I sat down next to her and she just, we just hit it off.

Speaker 6:          01:52:48       It was so great, but we were sitting next to each other the whole time. We didn't get up and go anywhere. So I didn't see her walk. And then we went out the next night in New York on a date with a bunch of friends, had a great time, Bam, like so awesome. And then on the third day, my buddy who pulled me aside, he was like, you might want to go out with her and the sunlight and like check her out. I was like, why? He was like, I think something's wrong with the chick was like, what do you mean? I didn't notice a thing. I didn't notice a thing wrong with her. I thought she was perfect and then I go out with her in the sunlight. It took her onto like a brunch. I met her at her house. She was a trust fund kid too, which made it even harder.

Speaker 6:          01:53:22       But she was wearing sneakers and I was like, that's an odd choice for a brunch is track shoes, like sneakers with a sun dress. And then I saw her lip and I was like, oh fuck, something's going on. And then we ate dinner. She only used or like left hand or her right hand one, one hand the whole time to do everything with. And I was like, fuck, she's got several Paul. Like I didn't know. But then I found out and then you become the guy that you're like, will I date the girl with cerebral palsy and or will I be the guy that goes, fuck you. I don't want you to die soul. I don't want that hassle of my life. And I was like, fuck it. I'm going to date her. I liked her when I didn't think she had cerebral palsy and then, and now I know what, I'm not going to fucking throw her to the wolves.

Speaker 6:          01:54:01       And so I started dating her and then she went to Scotland with me and Patrice and rich Vos and fucking, she showed how crazy she was. She was a nightmare. But trees was the first theater. He's like, I don't like your bitch. Crazy end cerebral palsy. Really crazy. I think the, yeah, I think, you know, I'm sure it's her history that's got to creep in on her, you know, having a disability. But she was a fucking nightmare. Like one night she was standing at the foot of my bed naked and screaming at me going, you won't fuck me. Fuck me. You and Patrice walked like literally walk stuck his head and he was like, all right and shut the door. It was, she was crazy. We were in a a house in Scotland doing a, the Edinburgh fringe festival and then she was a nightmare fucking, but my biggest thing was like, man, how much it would drunk do you have to be to not notice the chick you're dating has cerebral palsy?

Speaker 6:          01:54:48       Like I guess if you were totally trashed and you just try and look at the bright side of things. So yeah. But you know, your first few days with a check, he, it's out. How many dates did you have before you took her away to, to until I realized she had cerebral palsy. Two or three. It took you to hold dates before you realized, oh yeah, like two whole days. It's like hanging out and walking around with her. Wow. You know what it is something that would even fucking weirder about it is that she was a massive fan of guns and roses. And then when, when I was doing the act show with Gary Valentine, um, we ended up interviewing slash from guns and roses and so slash showed up at, and I was like, man, this chick, I can't remember her name right now, but I go, this chick love slash my color.

Speaker 6:          01:55:28       I had a number on my cell phone and call her and I said, just so you know, she lived in La. I go slashes in my, in my green room right now, drinking, if you want to meet slash I've got to drive on for you over at the gate. Come on. And he's going to be here for awhile. We haven't even started taping and he's not flying out until 10 and he wants to stay in my room drinking. So she showed up to the taping, she sits in the, in the back and watches me do the interview with him and, and it was great interview and then we get done. And I said to her, go to my green. And I told one of the guys, figured in my green room, so me and slash or one of the green room with her, I go, I go, listen.

Speaker 6:          01:55:59       And slash just so you know, this chick I dated, um, is a big fans of guns [inaudible] roses and she just wants to meet you. And they talk and man, and she is hottest fucking Shit and slashing are pretty hammered it for like eight in the morning. And then she gets up to go to the bathroom and I see her distinctively like limp to the bathroom and walk out of my room and slash looks over at me and he goes, how perfect is she? And I was like, you didn't see her limp. And he's like, what are you talking about? And I was like, great, I'm just as big an alcoholic as slash like slash didn't notice and I didn't fucking notice. But yeah, so she was fucking crazy though. To how long did dinner for uh, Scotland? You got rid of her after that got rid of her Scotland and then kinda hooked back up with her in La because you couldn't get a Dui because no one could give her a fucking wrote field sobriety tests or what?

Speaker 6:          01:56:45       Can they just give her brother and I was there or they could, but when she did a field service he goes, oh, I have several palsy. And they'd be like, oh, okay. They feel uncomfortable. Oh No, don't worry about it. So she ever drunk with cerebral palsy? Oh, all the time. Whoa. She was, uh, she, she's done not listening to that. She was a hot mess. Juanque with cerebral palsy and driving. Yeah. And only can use one arm. Cerebral Palsy is just like, it happens and then it's there forever. It doesn't like escalate. Really? Yeah. It's like, it's like you got no brain delivered to your don't know oxygen delivery to your brain when you're a baby and then it, you, she had like a hook, not a hook hand, but not a whole can. But like, uh, like uh, this hand and then her leg was really skinny.

Speaker 6:          01:57:22       Wow. I remember boundaries. She were when we were in Scotland where these really hot leather pants and been trees just leans over and he's like, nice pants on your girl. Too Bad. There's a baby leg, Jesus of bugging beast. But anyway, yeah, we partied and then one night she was a fucking nightmare. Rescued cats and then rescued cats but only to take them on walks at Runyon. Who takes a fucking cat on a walking? She goes leash. Yeah. She goes, do you like run yet? And I was like, hey. And she's like, let's go on a hike. And then now I'm thinking taking a hike with a girl with cerebral palsy with a fucking cat. Like that is way awesome. So they can't fix that. We'll pause it as no, no therapy for, it's like diminished oxygen into the parts of the body and it just, it is what it is.

Speaker 6:          01:58:08       It is what it is and there's no way to fix it. You can't, what if they exercise? Is that possible? No, they can't exercise. No. And I'm number one night we were laying in bed in Scotland and I was like scratching her bad arm and I remember never bucking, you know, there's like dude, chill type moments and she just leaned over. She goes, you're not going to fix it. Oh No. I was like, what? She goes, I can't feel it. I can't feel it, so don't do it. Oh, it's just like, uh, I can't leave this kid. Check this one at the door. Yeah. That's brutal man. It's brutal when somebody is angry at a disability and you know, you

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       don't have anything to say, there's nothing you could say. They just have to just absorb their uncomfortable moment. She was so hot, so hot. I can't even tell you. Wow. I swear to got Angelina was opposing him. Uh, I'd never fucked her. I just got to or you know, other stuff like what a blow job with the good hand, with the good hand. And she was a little bit of like, did you have a couple of balls with a numb hand? No, they just call up good cup. But her ex boyfriend who had just gotten out of prison called right after the blowjob. It is, I'm telling you what, it's kind of a prison. It just got out of prison. Did he call it like as you were calming the phone rings a borderline. I would say I was, I would all, I would offer, I would offer it up as in, I definitely was still in bed and she got out like, and it was brand new and he called and they started fighting on the phone and I went and I just was like, I'm out of here.

Speaker 4:          01:59:33       And she was like, what? She's like, don't leave. And then he was, she's like, nobody, go fuck yourself. And then hung up on him. And I was like, now he's definitely coming over here. And then I was like, I'm fucking out of here. I don't want no part of this drama. It was also when I was like a massive batch on, I just didn't want that shit. I didn't want the fucking drama that came with the girlfriend with one. I said, oh, I was like, I'm in and out of here. I'm fucking, no, thank you. And she was like, and I remember her saying something like, I just had your dick in my mouth or something like that, like hit you in the center of the chest and you were like, oh. And then, uh, and then I walked home from sunset. I was living across the street from Andy Dick at the time.

Speaker 4:          02:00:04       Oh No, no. I walked down songs all the way from sunset to fucking meet wherever and he used to live. No, there's in the back of it like, you know, uh, Beverly and Lausanne nigger like right around there. And I've walked, I walked home. I was like, I don't want the fucking drama. How long did that take? It was a long walk, but I was pretty hammer and I stopped a few bars and I think nick sports and yelled, yelled something. I said, yeah, he stopped. Oh, walked in a bar. Just rolling. Oh, Barb walked into a bar before. Are you shitting me? Best conversations you'll ever get into. Fuck yes. Especially you walking on your own. Yes. Sit down. Yeah, all the time. Brian, what? Walk into a bar and sit down. Talk to a strangely. Definitely by yourself all the time. Hotels. What are you doing?

Speaker 4:          02:00:47       Hotels. Oh, I don't go to the ball. I go to the bar and I sit down and fucking talk shit. And have you ever die all the time. You go to bars by herself at the time? Definitely. I definitely do that. Really? Yeah. If I'm bored, I'll go to a bar and just hang out, look at shifts, trying to find, pick up a girl, you know, like just see what the deal is. I'm going to have a beer. I'm not going to sit at home and drink a pair. I'll have a couple of beers that have never done. I'll have no Joe, Joe, Joe, you got to, you know, kind of pool halls with bars. It's just, it's the same thing. It's the same thing. I got to play pool, but yeah. All right, well I was playing on my iPhone world on Warcraft. Same thing. You, but you, you, you would definitely get a kick out of the way. People just divulged shit that you'd never tell people. I do it at a hotel bars all the time now. Like that's when he get drunk woman stories. Yeah. And Yeah. Oh look bad husbands like you want to tell you about their bad husband's. Half of my ex

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       girlfriends I met at bars is hanging out, you know, fucking hot chick dating her for a couple of chicken, a bar to be blind. You Stud. I've never been able to meet a chick at a bar. That's how you have to do it. I I, how else do you meet a girl like I, when I lived in Columbus, Ohio, I was like, all right. Uh, what else do I do? I can go to the bowling alley. That's my entire dating life outside of college was doing standup. I just met Greg seat standups. Huge. That's I think one of the best things of stand out. So, so much better. So much. So much easier than meeting the girl. Going to a bar, meet someone after a show and you have something to talk about. Absolutely. Here, the chicks I fucked while as low as the stand up stand up one from Liverpool whose tongue wouldn't go out of her mouth.

Speaker 2:          02:02:21       It wouldn't cause there was a piece of skin connected from the bottom of my mouth towards the tip of her tongue. So hard time calling. She can, she can do this. Is this like, oh wow. So the whole time you kissed her, you never got hurt you. You were just looking for tongue fucking nightmare. Yeah. The you ever had a nightmare can just really in a big long tongues? No. And she smoked and she drank Hennessy. So I just, the whole time I made out with her, I was like, this is what kissing Tupac would be like, Hey, you hear about the two pop pop porno, the see these stills from that. Joey said something about it real. Yeah, it's real. But even the other guy that's in it that was like in a whatever digital underground or whatever, he's like, oh no, I knew about this tape for a long time. Is he wearing the nose and glasses too? No, not that guy.

Speaker 2:          02:03:08       Tupac. Why don't you go from behind. You're doing cause I'm about to ruin your asshole. That guy was hilarious. Whatever happened in that he was a big producer. I heard. Really? I think he's still produces probably. Why wouldn't he keep producing cds of his own digital underground was awesome. I don't know. I saw him once in a small bar, like a really tiny bar and it was when digital cameras first came out. Now it's taking photos and all of them are just blurry masses on one of them. You can see like a blur and it knows from him wearing that the humpty nowadays.

Speaker 1:          02:03:37       Oh that's Kinda cool. Yeah. Was this a post success, like they weren't famous yet,

Speaker 2:          02:03:42       right? Right. Yeah. It was just a small little bit. He's still wearing the nose.

Speaker 1:          02:03:46       Fucking weird thing for artists. For musical artists, it's a totally different world for them. It's so hard for them to get their shit out to people, you know now because of the Internet, but back then you know you needed the radio, you needed the radio to pump you up. That was the only way he got successful and they would get successful for like one fucking CD and then they'd be gone and this CD and they'd be gone. Eddie Bravo explained it to me because he's a musician, he knows a lot about the business and he says that apparently what it is is it's all so that the producers can make a shitload of money because the way contracts are set up, the first cds, the producers make the majority of the profits and then they basically say, once you become a hit, then you become a hit and then you make money on your, you know, your next contract. Commodity can makes total sense. Yeah. Because the producers will make you, they'll make you successful. So they would do this and uh, just pump and dump,

Speaker 8:          02:04:38       make a new one and get rid of him, make a new one to get rid of him. So they kept making all these hits. The producers would make all this money, but the artists didn't make nearly as much money as they should have made. And then their career was over really quickly. No one wanted to play their shit anymore. Now they're not. If you weren't in a record deal with one of the big record companies and they wouldn't play your shit on the radio. Makes total sense. You have an ability to make a hit. Which one are you going to do it on? The one you get no money or the one you get all the money you make the one on one. All the ones you ever read. There was a thing that Courtney love wrote where she explained where the money comes from.

Speaker 8:          02:05:08       Some say that someone else ghost wrote it, but uh, that's probably just their hate and they probably just don't realize how smart she is, but she, I don't know. Maybe they are. You think she's crazy? For sure, but she's probably smart too. It's definitely smart enough to get to work. She might be, she dated crazy guys. She's crazy. But I think she's probably clever too. I don't know. I'm just guessing. But anyway, she broke down how, where the money goes when someone gets a record deal and where the, where the, how the money flows down through, you know, back to the artist. And it's really pretty ridiculous. I mean it's, it's a, it's really incredibly stacked for the record companies. But you know, I mean that's, they have to put forth the money. I mean, it's a business. They're the ones who have to invest the money in order to make the artists famous.

Speaker 8:          02:05:53       I mean, it is sort of a parasitic relationship, but a certain point, but it doesn't even exist anymore. So what's the point? You know, now all you do, what you mean now really the, the Internet is your friend. That's what you want to do. You want to get something where people get ahold of it. It spreads virally, you know, have a cool video, gets out, it spreads virally and then you tour. You know what I mean? That's really the only way to do it now towards where you make your money as an artist. Yeah. I mean, how many bands are just releasing their shit for free online now? They'll release their whole CD for free. Right. Oh, fucking Wilco started all that. Have you seen, I'm trying to break your heart by Wilco. No, it's one of my, one of my favorite documentaries ever. The Wilco makes an album, I guess what I'm going to say, any big company named bigotry here, Sony or whatever pays to make it.

Speaker 8:          02:06:33       They submitted, the company says we don't want it. Everyone gets fired at the top of the company. New Group comes on and they go, don't worry, you can have it. We don't even want it. Wilco takes it out on tour. That album releases it online for free in this documentary on this documentary, this is all happening and then all of a sudden another, like a subsidiary of Sony, the big company buys the album for like three times. They originally paid to make it and it's, it's really great documentary and if you like Wilco, it's a lot of their acoustic music, but it's a great documentary, but I don't even, you know, Wilco is seriously never heard of. They're great Joe. There are a, it's a, it's a, I would say, yeah. I'm interested to see if you like him or night. I like welcome back. It's borderline that you would like it.

Speaker 8:          02:07:13       No, it's no, they released their shit for free online. No, not now. Not now. They because it blown up and so you can get some of their shuttle and free for free online. Jeff tweedy does is the lead singer. He does living room shows where he sits in the living room. People pay a ton of money, like a Google pay a ton of money. They all chip in like say 10 grand each to have him in his living room, but then his, he'll donate it to charity and it was play acoustic in their living room. He's an amazing guy. The documentary is great. It is. They say it's country music but it's like modern countries. Jason [inaudible] favorite band. Really. It's really good. And, and, and I'll turn you on the call again. Wilko Wilko I'll make you a me some mix tape of that sounds gay, but I'll make you a, but I'll, I'll turn you on some tracks that you'll like and then once you like those, you'll start getting into, it's definitely something you can get high too.

Speaker 8:          02:08:00       I think a lot of those specialty Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and so these guys became, what's that? Fox Foxtrot? The first albums. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot bloodhound gang. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. But it's a great, I think you'll really like it. Dude. Gawker apparently has a, uh, an article. Exactly saying what I said, what everyone is too polite to say about Steve Jobs. Oh, tweet that shit. I'll tweet it. I'll retweet it as true to wow. It's unfortunate. Whatever, man. Nobody deserves to die of pancreatic cancer. Fuck yes. That's what I'm talking about as fuck. That's amazing man. When your body just fucking gives out and fails you. But I do believe, I do believe not to get on that same vibe, but I do believe in negative energy coming back to haunt you. I know that I my could be, but I don't think that's what did him, I like I said, I think he worked too hard.

Speaker 8:          02:08:49       Really? Yeah. I think you, you red line in everyday life, that guy did and there's a lot of stress involved. You know, it puts a lot of, put a lot of pressure on himself to be the, you know, how many hours do you sleep at night? Me, I try to get eight. I really, I'm a big stickler for that man. I don't think it's good to not get sleep every time I have and tried to burn through the day with no sleep. I feel like shit, I make it a priority to try to take naps wherever I can. You know, if I can't get, you know, eight in a row, I tried to get an aid accumulated. I think it's one of the most important things. It's cause I know from exercise that you can't exercise and not recover. If you do, you're going to burn yourself out.

Speaker 8:          02:09:23       You're going to overtrain. You need to recover. And that's what sleep is, man. You have to recover. You can't just burn it every day. Eventually it'll, you're, you fucking, you know, you red line your machine too much. Shit's gonna start breaking. Uh, yeah. Like I feel mine breaking down. Do you get eight hours sleep at night? No. How close? It's hard when you have kids too. I have a kid and a puppy. I can't like we are, I get, I get up a couple times a night with someone having a nightmare or the dog just fucking one to eat my face. And then, and then you, and then I know even on the road now I'm in that habit of like fall asleep, wake up falsely of growing up. But I also, um, I think I get that thing, that sleep apnea shit. Of course you did.

Speaker 8:          02:10:03       And so I, and that is been a big proponent of me working out, trying to get skinnier on the road. Just some like, I don't want to fucking like, I've been in bed where you're like, and you're like, what the fuck? Like my body just almost died. Right. And I'm sleeping through it. Well, you can die to some big football player died just a couple of years ago. Some big heavy dude. He's like in his forties early forties died of sleep apnea. Just stop or you used to sleep a lot and now I will. Now I want to sleep more. I want to get better. A better sleep. Well again, shape the real thing man is

Speaker 7:          02:10:34       the alcohol. You know, your, your alcohol, your, every time you drink a beer you're drinking a ton of negative calories, you know, and it's just empty, empty shifts,

Speaker 4:          02:10:44       energy. But I, but, but I burn, I think I'm, I'm not in the calorie wise. I think I go through it.

Speaker 7:          02:10:52       Wait, that's the big thing that was an empty calories. I mean if you want to lose weight, it's so simple. Eat a vegetable based diet, eat a plant and vegetable, the base diet. Eat very few starches but a lot of salads, a lot of, you know, really healthy, fresh organic vegetables. Drink a shitload of water and wait to fly off your body. Eat as much salad as you fucking can get into your mouth, you know, eat it to the point where you, you know, you're completely stuffed. You couldn't have another bite. I mean it's gross. Nobody wants to do it. You know, you want to have a cheeseburger is you want to have pizza. That stuff's all delicious, but that stuff takes a fuck of a lot to break down and all the shit that we have that has corn syrup in it and all the shit that we have that has all sorts of crazy carbohydrates and just, we're just, it's so easy to get fat. The American diet is absolutely brutal, you know, and that bear shit, I can help them,

Speaker 4:          02:11:43       but it's fun. We get the problem. What am I going to do? Am I going to sit and read? Yeah, you do that too. I've been through, I've been sober for big, long stretches and I just go, so what, what do you like? Go to the movies again, like what do we do tonight? My, we're just not going to talk and we'll just sit here and be treated book. You have a couple of glasses of wine and you and your wife were like talking and you're having a party. It's like, it's like, hey, you want to open a bottle of wine with dinner? And then you all of a sudden you have a bottle of wine and she's like, you're never gonna believe what happened. I was at with Eila today. And then you start laughing and then, and then, but we definitely have sober dinners and you're like, you wanna play scrabble tonight? She's like, yeah. And he like scrap.

Speaker 7:          02:12:20       Oh, so you like get drunk Dennis better puck. Yes. How many nights a week here are you getting lit up? Me? Yeah, like in real real like seven, seven nights a week and getting lit up. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker 4:          02:12:36       But not lit up, but definitely by, I would say by your standards. If you were sitting next to me as my body guard and Mexico, you'd definitely be like lit up. How many drinks are we talking about every night? I don't know. I can't like ballpark it that way. No, no. I mean, I could do, hey, let's not get, let's, let's not lie, but it's a light day. If I have like four beers, four beers I'll do, I won't even feel it. And I'll just go to bed. How dare you sir? Four beers. Four beers. And I'm like fucking done. Wow. Every night, man. No, no, no. Don't worry about that.

Speaker 7:          02:13:07       I was doing that every night. I would worry if I was getting lit up every night.

Speaker 4:          02:13:10       Yeah. But yeah, but we could fucking seriously, but there, why are we doing this? Can we go back and I know we just got on a subject. No, no, no. I said you don't drink every day is what you're saying it.

Speaker 7:          02:13:24       I mean, I, I, like I said, I don't think there's anything wrong with a couple of drinks every day. If you want to do it.

Speaker 4:          02:13:28       Yeah. Couple of the regular guys put paper to me. Yeah, I

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       put that aside. That's you're going to pay that. You gotta to pay for that

Speaker 2:          02:13:34       pay for what though? Health? Like liver wise. Sure. So does those taking sweaty seven official oil pills a day? It doesn't that fuck over your liver. No, it doesn't fuck up your liver for food, but you're, you're taking so much supplements that could fuck up your liver room or my supplements. I get my blood checked, I know what I'm doing in my by no you deal but, but I didn't fuck your liver up alcohol, vitamins or just food. It's just broken down. Food is not hard for your body to process them at all. That's a complete misnomer. It's just not true. Yeah. But if you're doing like, I dunno like levels of vitamins. Yeah you can. There's certain things that like fat soluble vitamins that you could have, you know that you take too much of them and they get into your system. But if you're getting your blood check, do you know what you're doing?

Speaker 2:          02:14:19       If you know your dosage are, I'll get my blood checked, my liver with be, should everybody, should I go to a checkup once a year and then, and I, and you know my four beers are pounded, like back to back to back the course. Go do the first show, second show, have a beer, and then have a couple of years out of the show. But, and then I definitely will say that I drink, I would say more than the average American, 100% but I have a different lifestyle than the average American. And I also spend my time differently than the average American I, you know, I'm not gonna I'm all for

Speaker 1:          02:14:51       thing that you do that might not be so good for you, that sort of kind of enhances your life. And I think alcohol falls into that, you know? I mean if that's what you choose to do. Look, all of my favorite people have either had problems with drugs or you know, or it could have a problem with drugs where it wouldn't be.

Speaker 2:          02:15:09       So you had an alcoholic just anonymous. Right now you're not telling anyone. I hope. Why are you so angry about alcohol? You know why? Because Joey Diaz told me you're an android.

Speaker 1:          02:15:19       Oh, there's a point of view on something. It doesn't mean they're angry on it. I don't, I just said that I think that alcohol is probably worth it because it enhances your life enough to balance out whatever damage is doing to your body. You know, I think some of the most fun times I've ever had has been buzzed. I went with Aubrey, we went to a country western bar in Houston after the show on Thursday night or a Friday night rather. And Houston, we had a great fucking time and the booze was flying. We were doing shots every night, cause I don't think it's healthy. I think every night. No, no, no, no, no. Your body suffers, man. If you, if you get hammered every night, I believe that your, your performance suffers. I know it's suffers because I know my set suffer. If I have a hangover, my sets on stage, they don't, they're not, they're not as good. If I'm hung over, I know that hung over. You're funny drunk. I'm funny as shit.

Speaker 2:          02:16:08       No drunk. I'm not funny. Really drunk. I'm not funny drunk. Um, I'm rambling and I'm, and I, and I don't know where I'm going and I don't mean like hammers. No, no, no, no. So, but like, but if I'm, if I'm hung over and I have a cup of coffee, man, my brain fires weird and it's funny as shit. Really? Yeah. That's interesting. I'm actually, I think I enjoy being hung over than I enjoy being sober.

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       See, I think right away when I'm hung over, I was always thinking, what did you do? Stupid. Look what you did here.

Speaker 6:          02:16:37       I got through with him, you know, and I say, I go buddy, let's get it back up. We know we did to ourselves. We're on the same team here. Let's have a cup of coffee if we need to, we'll do it. Let's fucking write this boat.

Speaker 1:          02:16:45       Well, most of what I do is try to get a light workout in and drink a shitload of

Speaker 6:          02:16:50       fucking totally work out. And if I work out, it's gone. The hangover grilling a hundred percent never throw up. Throw up if you from hangover. Never

Speaker 1:          02:16:58       workout too hard though. You could Jack Yourself. I've done that too. I've, uh, I've had a Hong Kong, I've been hung over and to decided I'm just going to get a crazy workout in. Yeah,

Speaker 8:          02:17:06       yeah. Fucking blow it out and then I'm just useless than just kills me. Yeah, that's dangerous.

Speaker 6:          02:17:11       No, I don't, I don't, you know, obviously I'm talking about ellipticals on a fucking hotel room.

Speaker 1:          02:17:15       Either that, man, let me tell you some elliptical machine. If you do it at a high level and you do it a lot of intensity, you should see I do elliptical workout, a 40 minute elliptical workout dude, where I have it all set up where the first three minutes it's pretty light. And then the second two minutes I pick up the pace and then I go through these intimate and sprints where I get up to whatever the level is. That's the highest. I'll jack it up to the highest and do like a one minute wrestling match of death with that fucking elliptical machine. And then I'll drop it down to like half the speed and I sprint and it's a bow Rudel brutal workout to the point where, and when I'm done, sometimes my fucking hands are numb from gripping the polls. I'm shaking, my heart's pounding like I, I've been drenched with sweat when I was in Hawaii the last time I did it, I had puddles to the left and the right amount of elliptical machine. You could get a fucking for Roche, this workout in an elliptical machine, you just gotta do it like a madman. You can't do it like a pussy,

Speaker 6:          02:18:08       like Judah Friedlander. Two to Freelander crazy is a beast of a workout or elliptical. Does he really like, you almost think he's making fun of people working on a little lipstick.

Speaker 8:          02:18:20       You're like, what the fuck is you doing it for comic relief? No, no. He's going to do the podcast soon. So is David Tell David tells doing their dog the fuck the last Tuesday in October he's going to be doing it. David [inaudible] best management contacted me. It's so funny. I don't think Dave has an email. He doesn't have an email. I don't think so. I wouldn't be shocked if he, you know, Todd glass doesn't have an email. Like I wouldn't be shocked. No tog last send them an email. I wouldn't even think talking about she has a cell phone. You know what? I think that's true because Todd glass and I spoke on the phone once and he was like excited to get me on the phone and I think he said something crazy like I don't have a cell phone or I'd give it to you

Speaker 6:          02:19:02       and he made, maybe I'm, no, no, no, no, you're accurate. I've, because I've heard that but it tells us it run is like his Twitter is like please see Dave at and and his mind space back in the day was like that and Dave just isn't that guy nor Mcdonald's there. Those guys are like old school in the sense that they didn't see the benefit to wasting, they're already valuable time. What? Cause they were famous before the whole Internet ship blew up. I mean you're, you're in that, you put out your brand. I was thinking about this the other night. I was like, your brand has been your, was your brand? Well, right when the Internet started, like you're fucking your website with the aliens and the fucking, and your blog. I mean, how long did you keep up with the fucking blog?

Speaker 1:          02:19:43       I've been writing a book, so I haven't written a blog in forever now for those asking, I had a problem with a disagreement with the people that wanted to publish the book. They wanted to do it different. And My, my vision was to do my way of looking at the world intertwined with how the things that I've learned about how to, to, to control myself and operate through life and, and, and the, the perspective that I've gained on how bizarre and strange just life is in general. It's a very, it's a very weird book, but it's, a lot of it is really funny, but a lot of is just really strange. And when I brought it to them, they didn't like the really strange stuff.

Speaker 6:          02:20:22       And then they don't know who you are.

Speaker 1:          02:20:23       Yeah. They wanted me to do, they actually wanted me to do my standup. They said, why don't you take your stand up and just transcribe it? And I was like, Oh, I'm going to send you some blogs like you gotta you gotta read my shit. And they're like, this is brilliant writing. We love it, but it's really not funny. You're not trying to be funny. And I'm like, yeah, but there's some of them that are funny like this, these two of them sending you aren't here. I'll send you a funny one. We like this one. Can you make them all like this? And I'm like, no, I can't make them all like this because sometimes there's some shit that I've, I'm, I'm thinking of or I want to talk about that isn't funny. It just happens to be bizarre.

Speaker 6:          02:20:54       But that's the, that is the, the business of someone buying into the brand of Joe Rogan, not knowing what the brand is like them going like

Speaker 1:          02:21:02       believe in a brand man. You know,

Speaker 6:          02:21:04       you totally are a brand though. I don't believe in a brand either. I always believe, but your brand, I mean seriously it of all the fucking comics I could want their brand to be. Your brand is always reinventing itself. It's always something new. It's over. Whatever you find interesting. Whether it's fucking, you know, dis, you know back in someone who's a fan of, of you on Newsradio, it's MMA. Then it's the podcast. It's marijuana is DMT. It's all these interesting fear factor, fear factor. If you were going to put the brand of the new Joe Rogan out, the new brand would not go back to fear factor, but you say, hey, I fucking like that show. It was a fun show to shoot. I love those people and it was a good show. That's the brand that's, it's always reinventing himself, you know, to be a brand where you go, I'm the, I'm not going to say, but like I'm the Mexican comic that always has the Mexican parents. I did the Mexican things. That's what you're thinking of brand when when you say, I don't want to think, believe in brand. Yep.

Speaker 1:          02:21:53       I'm just myself. You know exactly what a brand, it seems weird to call that a brand when you're just yourself, you know?

Speaker 6:          02:21:59       Yeah. But despite, would you believe, and I only know this from going on the road and running into people that are fans of your podcast, there are a lot of people like you.

Speaker 1:          02:22:06       Yeah, of course. That's the, one of the more interesting things about this podcast is that all of us, or reaching out to a bunch of people out there that don't know anybody like us but think like us and they, they're surrounded by a bunch of fucking morons and thinking a completely different way. And it's stifling. It's stifling and it's depressing and it just doesn't give him any hope. And I can't tell you how many times you've been on the, and just this weekend and Houston I talked to, I don't know how many, literally hundreds of people who told me that it changed their life. They're like, do to change my life. It changed my life cause they know they don't have it. It's not, they're not. No one, no one is representing that point of view out there in the media. You couldn't do it on a regular mainstream radio show. It's impossible. You couldn't do it on a television show,

Speaker 2:          02:22:45       but despite that you couldn't even reach out to the people that are listening to you when they're listening to you. Yeah, like dude's got his headset and he and his ears at target Sunday and I got another car with my wife and he goes, Holy Shit. Takes it out. The fucking machine is listening to your podcast in his ears. Put fucking loading up carts. You can't connect with any of those outlets that way.

Speaker 1:          02:23:06       I had a power lunch with Alex Jones, Brendan Walsh, Doug Benson and Joey Diaz and Aubrey from on labs and a four dudes from my message board. We had this power lunch and we're all sitting in this Mexican place drinking Margarita is before the fights and eating burritos and it was just like I was, I got some videos of it. Some of them I can't show cause Joey Diaz once. It doesn't want me to show him some of the things that he said, but they were absolutely hilarious, but he doesn't want to get in trouble. But uh, while, while we're having this lunch, Alex Jones had the best point ever. He goes, he goes, you could take a TV camera, turn it on a guy and him and his buddies smoking a bong and it'd be the number one show on CBS, put it on an 8:00 PM at night. That's what people want to watch. He was your, your broadcast is that, that's what we want to watch. And I was like, you really could if they had a fucking show, if like some people and their buddies, if they were funny, they were really funny guys and it was just a bong and the table and a room and the living room and they're all sitting around shooting the shit and they're all intelligent and be the number one show.

Speaker 2:          02:24:10       Yeah. And it just call it four guy spoken a ball, four guys in a bong progressing a Bonk, you fucking hit show. I had at least two new wants to do with it. Talked about and then I tune it again cause I go, oh shit. They just figured out that if they tied the bond with string on the roof, they could swing it back and forth to each other.

Speaker 1:          02:24:25       Well there's more of those people out there then you would think there's more people out there like those four guys in a bomb. Then you would think, and that's something like with the podcast reaches and that's why you know you've never had a venue like that before. You know you've never had a connection like that with all those people. Like they'd want you, they didn't, they didn't know you were there and now there's, they're happy. They found you, you one of them.

Speaker 2:          02:24:46       It's like discovering a good band and you go, God is the first one to find out that band.

Speaker 1:          02:24:49       Yeah, but then we become mainstream. They fucking hate you once you get your first comedy central special. We started selling out arenas that it mad at you when, remember when he was the machine dude.

Speaker 2:          02:25:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:25:00       I was there in the early days. Man. People love to have something. That's a problem I have on my message board. Sometimes people love to be the people that know about it first and it's like new people will come on and then just relentlessly towards the new people for being new.

Speaker 2:          02:25:14       I've given up on that message board, I just can't do it anymore. It's kind of negative lately, right? Yeah. It's just, it's like, you know what, I could, I don't, I, I'm trying not to be on the Internet as much anymore so I'm not trying to just to do, to stop dealing with all the negative. Yeah. Cause it's like I need to check out tech news, I need to do this and that, but I'm kind of done with the sharing and the any more than I do already. You know the guy in sharing information. Yeah. Like I, I'm tired of letting people know who I am a little, but you put it all out there so far and I know you're dating, I've kind of gone back a lot more than normal. I'm not, not really doing it. It's like I check Twitter maybe once, twice a day.

Speaker 2:          02:25:55       Now it's Facebook. Forget about us because he'd becoming famous. And as you're becoming famous, you're dealing with a higher and higher volume of haters. Stay in bed longer. When you're famous, I've notice you get, you get a lot of haters, man. You know there's a lot of people that get upset at you and Felix somehow or another, they should be doing what you're doing. That is a accurate, yeah, there's some haters out there, man. And you, if you're online all the time, you're going to deal with those people. You know, they're gonna, they're gonna run into you when they're going to fucking throw up shit on your Twitter and you're going to look at it. But the good news is you just, it's good to know that people like that exist and just hit that block button and move along. I don't, I don't even fuck with them.

Speaker 2:          02:26:31       Do you block people below blog young buck anyway? No. Cause I don't have the, I don't know people's spam dude. I've had, I've had crazy people spam my entire timeline with like 10 messages in a row and you're like, okay. And then you block them. They come back as a different name. It's like a never ending story. It's so dumb. Yeah, dude, there's, I wonder how many people are actually trolling out there. You know, maybe it's like, I always like think it's like one dude has been trolling me forever. Right. I know Tom's occurs trolling me. Tom's a gorgeous calling me that it wasn't true. He told me he was trolling. Know who he is. I know he has

Speaker 6:          02:27:01       because this, okay, you ready? I'm going to find this girl. She's got a tweeted me and like pass two seconds. Cause I know this is not a real person. Oh, he's tweeting you with a girl. All right. Here's what I got to tell you her name. But here's what she tweeted me. Oh, here's her profile. I love Bert Kreischer get to meet Burton February. I Love Zach Baggins great to get to meet him in November. And I was the first poll reply of Bert Kreischer. This is what she writes. And then she goes, uh, or maybe exactly. I don't know.

So she's totally listening. I just thought you were sorry. I thought you were not a real person.

Speaker 2:          02:27:52       Could easily be real. Yeah, it's actually not. It's actually my girlfriend. This is a lot of people out there that are looking for someone to fixate on buddy. They're looking for someone to just lock their sights on.

Speaker 6:          02:28:00       Please find a pic of flying dildos. And until then I'll visualize it in my head forever as I think wants to be a real person. I totally thought this was a fucking one of my friends

Speaker 2:          02:28:09       lid. You're hilarious. Why would you think you'd have someone obsessed with you?

No fellow bear. You're so crazy a guarantee. You there's a girl this and ladies and gentlemen, this is your next task, Buck. When you see Bert Kreischer, when you see Bert Kreischer at a comedy club, just say burnt.

Stop being so hard on yourself. No, no, it's not hard on myself. But if you read these tweets, I believe the crazy person, he's fixated on you. You're a hilarious guy and she's enthralled by your talent. And she wants to put your hog in her mouth. Why is it so hard to believe? What do you know in man, I was this real fucking, come on man.

Speaker 6:          02:29:23       Someone like someone saying that to me online. Adam, all the fucking 20, 30,000 people that follow me. The one person that says that I go, all right, this is Tom Segura cause no one said that to me all day, but one person said it was like, I'm going to be honest. What bullshit

Speaker 7:          02:29:38       you to know if it's not fake humility that you're crazy because you're hilarious. I should expect

Speaker 6:          02:29:43       no, I get good emails. Oh, don't get me wrong. I get good tweets of like, hey, you're really funny. I'd love you on the podcast. You're great. When are you gonna go back on? Why don't you have your own podcast? None of them say, I want to give you a virtual blow.

Speaker 7:          02:29:53       If I was a girl and I was working in a diner in Dayton, Ohio, and uh, just broke up with my man. Didn't have a whole lot going on in my life, but I love that podcast. I listened to it on the treadmill every day and went, Burke crashes on my God. He is so funny. I almost peed my pants on that treadmill. You know what I did? I got on Twitter and I sent them a message.

Speaker 9:          02:30:11       Ooh, Ooh.

Speaker 7:          02:30:15       I've met some of those people that will send you crazy messages. And then Claudia and Paul Chou and trouble lick your ear and shit. They're out there, dude. They're real. Don't you wonder though, if so one of the comics is Kroger's, but he's like, well, that's real simple then don't respond to any of them other than fine.

Speaker 6:          02:30:29       So that's why I get, I want her to find where all the time and go, hey, thanks for the virtual budget.

Speaker 7:          02:30:33       Do you know dudes who are obsessive? You? We all do. We know do too obsessive about pussy. And I have some friends that I've thought about trawling. I have some friends that I'd love to put the boots to the slow. I would have to accumulate a lot of photographs of the same girl though because I'm going to have to like set up if I'm going to do a real troll. You gotta like accumulate like a bunch of photos. Didn't they do that to a hockey player? I think there was like a hockey player who was like kind of a famous because he got in a brawl. I don't remember the full story, but a bunch of his teammates trolled him with a fake account on my space and and saved all his messages and then posted it online or something like that. That movie catfish is all about that. Oh, is it really? I want his cat fish. I heard a girl. No, it's not funny, but no, no, no, not, not funny. Good guy meets a girl

Speaker 8:          02:31:20       online. Do you ever have that problem? We can say things are funny because it was a comic. No, it's really funny. If something's good. It's funny. How does that funeral hilarious. It's funny. The guy meets girl in line on my space. It starts going back and forth with her. A Facebook goes back and forth with her, goes back and forth with her, and then he goes, and then his friends are like, she doesn't, it's not real. Let's go fucking finer. Let's go find her. And they go to find her and they go to her mom's house in her mom's like, oh, she's offered some friends. And they're like, well, when will she be back? And they're like, she's like, oh, like in the weekend, they can't get in touch with her. And then his mom's like, she's in Rehab. And she's like, really? And he's like, yeah.

Speaker 8:          02:31:55       And he's like, there's something you don't wanna tell me. By the way, if you've seen this, haven't seen the movie. Stop listening right now. Oh, then don't tell me anymore. It's good. Oh, it's good. Scary. Yeah. Don't say any more romantic. Did you see red state? No. You've got to see red state. That's, you know, there's a movie. That's a very interesting case where, uh, I went to see it. I really recommended it very highly. It's a Kevin Smith's movie. They're really takes you for a loop. Totally didn't expect it. I thought it was going to be a comedy. Redstate is with Bruce Willis. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's the one with Tracy Morgan. You're thinking of the cop movie. Oh No, I was thinking more that Helen Mirren and, and all of them. No, no, no. Red State is a new movie that I'm Kevin Smith made and he released it on his own.

Speaker 8:          02:32:41       He did the whole thing on his own, shut off. He's like, he's putting it in just a few theaters so it can be considered for Oscar nominations for, especially from Michael Parks. He's the guy who plays this incredibly places preacher in the movie. But uh, it's an interesting, I fucking loved it, man. I thought it was a great movie, but like I look at the ratings online 6.5 out of 10 and uh, I talked to a lot of people and a lot of people loved it and a lot of people didn't like it at all. Really? Yeah, I was shocked. What, what's the premise? Well, it's kind of a convoluted premise, but it's all about religious people without giving away too much. It's all about crazy religious people and you know, and the fucking chaos ensues. Gunfire and just, it's like, I fucking love it. I love those.

Speaker 8:          02:33:23       It's a very terantin no asking movie, you know, it's a very, you know, you never know what the fuck is going to happen movie. And I enjoy the shit out of it. What's your opinion, everyone? I've been curious about the Hank Williams junior with Emma, uh, Monday night football debacle. Look, man, people compare someone to Hitler all the time, but when you're on Monday night fucking football and you start comparing, you know, republican playing golf with Obama, like Hitler playing golf with Benjamin Netanyahu, that's, that's first of all, it's a weak sentence. You know, like that's a stupid thing to say. It's dumb. Like, why would you, you know, really that's the best. Yeah, it's, it's, it's, you're trying, he's trying to go for a bold statement, but yeah, it's not saying shit. Come on. I mean it's, it's just too stupid and you're trying, and here's the thing, if he had just used a, it's like Martin Luther King playing with a negative person. I don't, he should be fired. I

Speaker 7:          02:34:18       think they're ridiculous. I think, you know, if they should look at it and go, well, you know, he could say, he should just say, sorry I said that and that would should be the end of it. Should be their mom is not a bad guy. He just said something that was dumb, you know, I mean, he's probably a tea party dude. He's probably a conservative Republican. I mean he's a country boy can survive guy, you know. So he probably thinks in his had bet if he sat down, you know, if somebody like fucking Christopher Hitchens sat down with him and had him, him break down what he sees wrong with the, you know, Obama and this administration and its involvement overseas, I bet every single fucking point would get debunked and it would fall apart right in front of his face have, I bet he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.

Speaker 7:          02:34:55       But it's fashionable right now to say that this country is falling apart because of Obama. One fucking asshole. I don't even know the guy's name, nor do I care. But he was on Fox News talking about how Obama has done more to hurt this country. The nine 11 it was the dumbest statement ever because then he goes, you know, if we could have had total victory, if we were allowed to, you know, you know, when, when nine 11 happened, you know, it happened. But then we went after them and we went after them. We wouldn't have to, who the fucking Iraqis had nothing to do with it. The innocent Iraqis are the innocent Afghanis who had nothing to do with nine 11 like what the fuck are you talking about? You can say shit like that on TV still. You can say shit like that, but you can't call Obama Hitler.

Speaker 7:          02:35:36       You can't knock 11th in the next like really bad word though. It's like shocking. This yogurt is nine 11 fuck get. Yeah, he, I think he's totally crossed the line but he's a moron. He crossed the line on a moron. You know, it's a, it's the, it's a more on premise, you know, the premise of this one guy is the one responsible for, you know, more bad things than September 11th and then he had some fucking crazy thing he was saying about self reliance and I'm no fan of this administration or any administration, but I'm also not a fan of people saying stupid Shit, you know? You know what I mean? That's stupid shit. Is it though? You know, now that I think about it, if he really wants to talk about what America has done overseas, you know, maybe I guess if you want to talk about just volume of people killed, you know, but you can't attribute that all to Obama was the, yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:36:24       Do you get to a certain point where you, I mean, how old do you know? 38 38 do you get to a certain point when you look at guys like Obama and you go, well that's guys just a few fucking years older than me. You know, this is, this is like, this is like my age. People my age are running this, this whole thing and who the fuck are they? You know, and it ha, what is this? I started doing that when I, when people would leave my shows and I say, thank you sir. When they'd say great show. And then I go, I'm fucking older than them. Assert to, yeah, I'm a fucking sir. And then I started thinking, man, my friends are like my friends or have had great jobs, lost a, lost her house, and then got good jobs to get. Like my friends are grownups, but I'm fucking child still. Yeah, but you're allowed to be, you're a comedian, you're an entertainer. Yeah, 100% I'm totally like, you know, I'm 100% of responses, but you know how you like look at when you look at politicians, man, don't you look at him as being something different? I always look them as being older, wiser,

Speaker 8:          02:37:16       more experienced, more educated, more this, more that. But then as you get older and you realize, well now I'm the same fucking age as them. You know, Obama was a guy, the guy, the guy that pulled the nice secretary of of the side, I'm sure his first day and was like, just tell me who to shake hands with. Just like everyone else. I mean, he's a regular fucking dude. Maybe. I mean, I don't believe that necessarily. You think it's, I don't think you can get to that high level unless you're compromised. I'm over exaggerating the statement, but I'm saying he's like one of us. Like if, if you get a job at a new place and they put you in your new office and the secretary comes in, she's like, would you like coffee? He's like, look, it's my first day. Like he was, he had to be like that to whoever his advisor was, right.

Speaker 8:          02:37:55       You know, when they started unloading shit, he's like a guy that you can relate to in a sense. 100%. Well, I feel like anybody 10 years younger than me and 10 years older than me in that group, I can relate to you. I know 10 years ago, I remember that very well and I can imagine 10 years from now, so I can relate to that. But I don't, when you, as I get to, uh, an older age, like where I am right now, when I look at it, I'm going to go to, I can't relate to any of these fucks. And these aren't really neat. They don't represent me. These are, these are crazy people. You know, their, their, their spokesperson for corporations. I don't know who fucking said this, but it was a brilliant line that, uh, I, for some comics had this, that um, politicians should be forced to wear jackets like Nascar drivers so you could see their sponsors.

Speaker 8:          02:38:35       Oh, that's fucking brilliant. It's fucking brilliant. I Dunno who it was. Whoever it was, it said that bravo sir or ma'am, but you're trying to relate. You're trying to relate to them on, on age and when in fact it's not, it's not age, it's just a kid's mindset. I know. You're totally right. I, Ronald Reagan, perfect example. I was the president. He was the president. He's like a fucking, he was like 60 years old or something, whatever it was when he was a president and you saw him on TV. Like that's a wise guy who's been around and he's taken a bullet. He's fucking can ride a horse, he can make a fence. And then when he got in trouble with selling arms to Iran, I remember that. I remember when he was like, I don't remember. I don't recall when it was like all that on TV. And everyone's saying, well, Ronald Reagan maybe losing his mind. He's an older guy and then he did, but how bizarre was that when he was on TV saying, I don't remember. I don't recall. Do you think he really didn't really? Do you think Alzheimer's is kicking in? Of course he had Alzheimer's. Did he have it then the only disease that doesn't make your rib, I think between Nancy Reagan and all the shit he knew, it was probably just a convenient way to check out. I wonder if he just faked his Alzheimer's.

Speaker 8:          02:39:40       He said, you know what? I know too much. The best way to get out of this and just pretend like I'm fucking losing grip. That's the best thing that I wrote. We wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let's get the cheeks. Wait, let me go back to Ronald Reagan. Faking all the gym. Imagine Nancy Reagan said, just say no. Just say no. Just say no. He's like, okay, okay. Okay. Okay. I heard you. I heard you. What's your name again? I heard you. Who are you? Who are you? Why are you here? Where's my pudding? He shows up at the front door in his pajamas. He's like, Ronald, did you get it out of the house again? And he's like, I was banging bowser. But yeah. Did you sell arms to Iran? I don't know. Did I don't recall. You should. We should eat showrooms or go to the Ronald Reagan Museum.

Speaker 8:          02:40:17       There was a guy named Janie tingle when I was a standup comedy, very famous, very respected comic from Boston back in 1988 I was just starting out doing comedy and I was an open miker and this was just when the scandal was breaking and he went on stage and he goes, Mr President, he goes, Lord knows I've forgotten some things I've done. You know, he get home, you Hamad, you can't find your fucking keys. You know why your windows are open and the air conditioning's on and it's January. And he goes, but here's just, just a little thing. If you ever sell arms to people who hate us, jot it down and make a little note. Put it on your refrigerator. When I remember at the time I was like, like that is standup comedy. Like what that guy he just nailed that is the essence of standup comedy on there isn't a sense though cause he drew the picture

Speaker 4:          02:41:11       doing he impression of him. I pictured a two story Boston flower with the Windows Open and the keys and I might have even made up although I don't remember the bit but those, that's how those guys worked back then and then you know like cause what the best part of that joke is is at the end you're like what's the point I'm going to be write it down, write it, jot it down. The way

Speaker 8:          02:41:31       fucking brilliant. That is that is stand up right. It's like having making a point and having it be funny. How did you get me from a to B in a way? This leaky way? Yeah. You sneak it in to just make it a little raindrop and effect. I centered more in deposition. Did you make a range? Cause my cameraman on these beers this entire time and I was just on your nipples. What do you worry about that stack of fucking beers in front of you? It's for telling. It's telling her it's nothing, right? No, it was for nothing wrong with it, but nothing. It's nothing wrong with it. I told you it's worth it, but booze is good. I have a card I need to give you. The doctor will help you out a card. We're indoctrinating you. He's pretending that this is an intervention. He's pretending you gotta pee Brian. Okay, Brian, why don't you go pee then? I've already peed once. I'm tired of being kind of a little girl. I gotta pee. I gotta pee three. Should we just end this thing or drink or pis?

Speaker 4:          02:42:26       Oh, I have way too much pitch is

Speaker 8:          02:42:31       p. Wow. Brian, that's gay. It's one thing to drink your own pee. It's another thing to drink somebody else's. That's, that's out of line. Um, what's going on? Bert?
