Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience, you're thinking, I want people to spend 30 40 bucks to go out and that'd be pissed him off and ruin your night with your wife for a date. No, really end up just trying to make you laugh. So now it's like, you know it, it's just so Joe, I can remember back with you and Mike McCarthy. Yeah, it was like who could work the dirtiest? You guys would be in the back just dying. There were nights made, can't even get high and say, let's see if we can walk the room and I've seen people suck and have a roof, but I mean women that we'd, we'd love that. Oh my God. I remember one night I was doing great and I said that let me get fucked up. And I turned on the crowd and then I felt bad because they will so upset.

Speaker 1:          00:46          So discuss with him and he's like, regulars usually come. I started trying to win him back with a bank I took, took me an hour and a half just to get them back. But there was another dude I showed I'll head over. There was a guy heckle him and I said, listen, if you don't shut up, I'm going to come down here puppy right in the fucking face. And I did. I went and went off the stage and up this fucking guy where he was bleeding and I mean, and the crowd was on his son. He's attacking us and it took me 45 minutes just to break even, you know? And then you kept going after you punched the guy in the face. Yeah. That's amazing. You didn't know. No God. Alando I don't know why. I know it wasn't linear. It was, you know, I was doing a bunch of one night isn't it with and I was, because the crowd was a big crowd, but it's been like 300 people and they all love being away and this guy just, and I fucking hate it. I wouldn't write a, put the mic down, Bang went off and he went down. He was screaming and crying. Wow. And I went up in a bipolar, that's the difference in Boston and Orlando.

Speaker 2:          01:54          But you didn't think that he was lying? I suspected he wasn't telling us the whole truth, but I thought he made some interesting points in Alpha to Alfred had was a pitcher in high school, North Miami Beach, senior high go chargers and Alfred had actually pitched against Alex Rodriguez. This is like one of his only more stories from his baseball years in high school, right is that Alex was a senior at the Alpha, was going to some sort of Ron Frasier, a baseball camp, had a u m and they did the summer league game and Alfred, this is my eyes are glazing over telling the story, but like Alfred Alfred pitches against a ride and who was already a senior already a beast. Everybody knew this guy was going to, was going to go in the draft and be huge. Everybody knew about that. He had been the talk of the high school baseball community in Miami forever and so Alfred pitched against him and he held a rod to a triple.

Speaker 2:          02:48          Of course, Alec, you know a red smacked the shit out of this ball, sailed away, but he alphabet, he was, it was only a triple. It wasn't, it was a rare, not home run for Alex. So I thought, oh, we have like a funny personal anecdote. Like we can find some common ground here, right? You're talking to someone who might be a potential interview subject, you know? And so I'm like, actually Alex, you and Alfred have met before Alpha rolls his eyes. Like he's going to embarrass me and tell this dumb shit story. So I tell out like, isn't this funny? Like you guys met and Alfred held you to a triple and he kind of looked at me like, you're looking at me right now. He's just, he was totally on amused and maybe looked even a little hurt or offended. Oh Wow. This is the greatest baseball, one of the greatest baseball players of all time, the highest paid baseball player in history.

Speaker 2:          03:34          And here I'm just telling this cute story from like 20 years earlier or whatever. And he seemed like I held me to a triple. I'm like, how could you be upset about that? You one of the greatest of all time super winners, but it's like, yeah, it's the, it's, it's, that's why I left. I was like, this guy's a really interesting character. Like he's a complicated guy. He's an interesting guy. He's a sensitive guy. Like I was curious about him. I was excited about the prospect of interviewing him and man, they practically ghosted us out. Yeah. The January of 2014, that's when they lowered, they reduce the suspension. I started hitting up every month. I started hitting up the publicists yo following up on that meeting. You know, cause it's funny, in the page six article it mentioned he met with the 30 for 30 filmmakers, Billy Corbin output Spellman.

Speaker 2:          04:18          Uh, he's been shopping a book proposal to these publishers. The book proposal thing was total bunk. Literally not true. The, the, the publishers were like, we'd love to get one, but we haven't gotten a book proposal from a Rod. He really did have the meeting with us. But like, so everything was just, we were just kind of pawns in his game, which is cool. Whatever they respond to this documentary. Not exactly, but I for only six or seven months, I'm emailing with the publicist and then it was clear that they weren't interested. So, and that became the tactic. By the way, when you said was there a strategy, the strategy was to shut the fuck up.

Speaker 3:          04:50          We have evidence again in the archaeological records of, of surgical procedures going far back. But who did them? They would have been um, you know, sometimes why they call them wise women comedy. Connie women on marver surgeons. So one of my, yeah, with the barber, I guess they're good razors, right? Yes. Yeah. Actually Barbara surgeons used to do things like pull your teeth. They used to blood, sweat. And so the Barber Pole, which is right in white is right and white because it was advertising their services is blood letters. So what they would do, they would tie these bloody rags around the pole and it would whip around the pole. I know it's one of my favorite stories. And, um, and the, the ball at the top represented the bowl that would catch the blood and the stick would have been the stick that you held to kind of get your veins to stick out and people were blood let for all kinds of reasons. Like you would do it like a purge or a diet or, or you would do it because you were ill. Um, the idea being that you had produced too much blood and you needed the blood to be let to kind of restore balance in your body.

Speaker 2:          05:52          What do you think it would be like to go back in time and hear someone say something that's stupid? Like, you're sick.

Speaker 3:          05:58          We need to remove some of your glove. Do you have too much blood in your system? Z show you're going to send all of these like crazy academic historians are like, we can't. Yeah, there you go. There Tom Sorial services. What does that mean? And you know what else? The barber shop quartet comes from the idea that the barber surgeons often had a musical loot in the office that you would play or the patient would play. It was like a musical therapy. Um, so there's all kinds of hangovers from it. And you know, the demon barber, a Sweeney Todd. Yeah. So this is kind of a, one of these stories that pops up and they think that it might be that medical practitioners were trying to undermine the legitimacy of the barbers. So you kind of either get this story that the barber, is this like sort of demon figure who's chopping you up in selling you and making you into pies? Or

Speaker 4:          06:48          is that a legit one? Because that seems like nonsense. Well it seems like it's a recreation of, it's an older one cause well it seems like parody, like look says, listen to my troubles. No charge. Listen to your troubles. 50 cents. They might've had that on there. Barbered thing when they're cutting bolts out of you, it's this bullets removed two bucks. I don't know. They're all drunk. Pomade, mustache wax.

Speaker 3:          07:09          Yeah. People, people thought that bullets were, uh, that gunpowder was poisonous. So a surgeon would often amputate if you were shot. Oh God. Until they kind of realize that sometimes it was okay to just keep the bullet in.

Speaker 4:          07:22          I am a firm believer that many of us who are feeling really good about life and having a great time here are v very, very lucky in their circumstance. Very lucky in, in, in the people you're around, the positive influences in your life, the good things, very lucky cause shit can be really not good and when things are really not good and people go down the spiral, whether it's with booze and cigarettes and heroin or whether it's with food or whether it's with alcohol or whether it's whatever, the pills, if you can go down a spiral, it's who out of the person that is in the bottom of the spiral who can pull themselves out. Could you, if you had to start from there instead of starting from a place of success, and this is why I think people get cocky. You wake up every morning like, oh, I guess everything's okay.

Speaker 4:          08:14          You know my lifestyle and the share. Instead think of what it would be like if you woke up and you were 380 pounds and this is your new life. Your new life is you got to get down from 380 pounds to about 220 pounds. You got to figure out how to do that and you've got to figure out how to not lapse. When you're aching with hunger. You got to figure out how, how your, your, your body has no fucking energy. It doesn't know how to recover. It never gets pushed. And you have to push it through that and you have to do that to the tune of 160 pounds. It's a lot of fucking weight, man. That's a lot of fucking weight. Most people are not going to be able to do that. It's a lot of weight to lose. How long that take you? Um, about how two and a half years. That's a, no matter what, that's an accomplishment, man. You know? And it's something that I think that when people hear that, that you did, that people realize like, I can do that too.

Speaker 1:          09:14          And, uh, you wondering why were these crazy Greeks put pine resin in there ruining perfectly good white wine. And then after a while you start to say, Hey, actually this is pretty good. Uh, you know, this is not a crazy thing after all. And you acquired case run resident and there were walls. Yes. You know, the first time, the first time I had scotch whiskey, I, I, uh, I didn't know what I thought about it. And now I love whiskey. Right. It's an acquired taste. So the first time you drink something like that, you think, you know, yes. They put resin, they put pine resin in their white wine. The chill it. I should have brought you some, maybe I'll send you on an acquired taste. Ouzo Koolaid. It's delicious from the beginning. Yeah. I just write out cold. It's a sweet good. Yes, yes, yes.

Speaker 1:          09:56          We'll have to convince anybody. Yes, that's right. That's right. Some things that's right. Some things are just good right out of the budget is good. Yes. Koolaid is just good. Yeah. I mean, I don't recommend you drink it all the time. It's full of sugar. It's terrible for you, but damn, that stuff tastes good. It's like, it's like a, it's like fried foods, you know? Yeah. Yummy. A lot of them French fries. Yes. I mean, come on man. Salt and catch up like that. How can you know? I'm uh, I'm not sure about what I should mention, but anyway, I love Popeye's fried chicken. Can I do as well? I love it so bad. It's awful. It's my wife. My wife is unlikely to listen to this full podcast, so, or I'll, I'll skip over this part so she doesn't hear this part but, and my sister will be listening probably and so she will laugh when she gets to this part because whenever I see my eyes I just pull over and indulge myself and then I terrible.

Speaker 1:          10:48          Terrible. It's awful. This is good. You know what, if you really want to indulge and you like chicken Roscoe's in La, I have it. No, you don't know. Oh, I don't know. Ascos chicken and waffles. Oh Dude. I tried to go the chicken and waffle family. We tried. Don't you make that tried to go there the other day with my family and a half. Wait on the same place. Sunday chicken and walls course on the same plate. What are you a communist? Yeah, man, it's La Syrup and butter. Yeah. You mean put it on there? Yes. It perfectly. It's not damn delicious in my mind yet from another pant I, I make maple syrup. I live in Vermont and I make Maple Syrup. I tap my own trees and wow. What a freak I have. I have a yeah, exactly. Even people hard time for waffles and chicken again.

Speaker 1:          11:37          Exactly what is, show me the colonel. The colonel is a liar. He does not have it. Get out of here. It's not even the colonel, the colonel's norm Macdonald. I saw a promotion or something that this is yeah, but they do not, oh my gosh. I walk from the syrup goes on top of the chicken. That chicken and wild, that waffles and chicken tastes like cat litter compared to Roscoe's is also sweet chick La. He could try to get this out of here. Uh, so, uh, it's stuff can go fuck off. Roscoe's chicken and waffles. Okay, so you get the Greens to the Collard Greens, Collard Greens. Yeah, that's fine. Damn good. That's fine. But that's a waste of maple syrup. Take it from a man who makes it up to put it on a show. Me a chick is good. I'm source sweets. It's not as as place.

Speaker 1:          12:22          I get it. I love it. I've been there. It's great. Roscoe's okay. Fuck off. There's a reason why there's an hour and a half wait on a Sunday. Okay. How long you in town for a just a day. Maybe I'll be back though. I'll be back over there right after the show. Maybe I'll go there for a little one on Gower. Okay. Ooh Man. It's good. All right. Maybe I'll try that. It's so good, but it's also one of those places. It's been there forever. We used to get it. I found out about it from 19 or 1994 when I was doing news radio. 95 ish, I guess. Have you been in La since you left the Massachusetts? No, I went to New York for a couple of years, then I moved down here, moved down here in [inaudible] 94 okay, so you've been here a long time. Yeah. And when I was on news radio, they got it for like you, you can order lunch and someone ordered Roscoe street became addicted. And I was like, what is this like waffles? And it was just like you waffles and chicken there. It looks. That's, that's, that's doesn't look as good as it looks when you're there. When you're there and you smell it. It's damn good. I'm doing a, Roscoe is commercial here. That's an incredible, I'm a fan. That's an incredible combination of items to say, oh, it's so good. And afterwards you better have nothing to do, man. Yeah. Going into a food coma son.

Speaker 1:          13:31          Anyway. Um, how do we get to that? W W I don't know. I was going to tell you maple syrup stories. Oh yeah. Going to different countries, different countries and opening your mind so you raise it. Yeah. So you are counteracting my resin flavored white wine with the Maple Syrup Syrup and grass chicken.
