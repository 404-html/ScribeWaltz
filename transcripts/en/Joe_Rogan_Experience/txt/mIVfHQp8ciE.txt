Speaker 1:          00:00          The general good experience, here's how so, so I've got just about been open for nine years with CSA. We had zero members when we started. I've got about $1,300, which was the motivation. What made you the motivation was that I spent. It was always a passion. I was doing martial arts when I was a child that was fighting. I just wasn't making money doing it and then I got into that other life and did that for about 15 years and I was being paid to protect people that could afford it but maybe didn't deserve it for a very long time. And unfortunately that's the way it works is if you can afford it, you probably don't deserve it. That's a funny way of looking at. Yeah. And it's, it's a, it's a true way of looking at it because I was doing it at the highest level, you know, I wasn't doing security work at the kids' choice awards, standing Jim Carey for two hours saying I'm Jim Carey's bodyguard.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Right. So it's one of those things where I saw it at the very highest level and it just, it turned me off after awhile because you know, you're just, you're, you're being a babysitter to people who have money. Even with the biggest threats from Iraq, Afghanistan, a Haiti run down the list. It wasn't about helping people and I was wanting to help people. So I get it. When I, when I opened the gym, that was the goal was to help people and it, it turned into that gym. And this is why I feel that our gym model is successful is because tonight at 5:30 during a boxing class, my professional fighters are going to be in class with everyone else. There's no protein, only practice. Everybody trains together. Everybody works together. The model is for people. You want to get in shape, wonderful. You're going to get into shape.

Speaker 1:          01:46          You want to have stress relief. Wonderful. You want to become a fighter? Wonderful. I don't have a fight team practice try out or any of that. You come to the gym, you put in the work, you support the team, you trained side by side with world champions, you get better, you have a good time. It's a huge family gym. It's a huge family environment and the mixture of the self defense and the fighting and the fitness one doesn't need the other. So unlike like an Aka and I love hobby, but the gym is about the fighters. Fighters lose. That's a fight. People go out the back door, right? For me, I kind of a fight or lose, my membership's not going to matter, but people are still gonna come, they're still going to train, they're still gonna support. They're still going to buy tickets and that's been the recipe.

Speaker 1:          02:26          And because the gym is that way, it's allowed me to have this model where I don't charge pro fighters. You're remarkably normal. Oh, thanks. I know people restricted at how normal I am. Just like, wow. Really? I think my reputation through maze, a famous child, that's a very unusual maze. Uh, yeah. Uh, my life is unique to me. That's what I like to say. And uh, I'm almost got peerless person, like to a certain extent, there's not too many people I can look left and right. And we, you know, I, I, like, we have similar experiences. Is there anybody that you ever contacted, like Jodie foster or someone who's made it through and seems pretty put together? Not really, no, not really. I mean, it's kind of a weird cold call, you know? Hey, Jodie foster, such a small clan people, like if a comic called me that I knew they wanted to talk to me, I would talk to them because it's such a small club of people.

Speaker 1:          03:27          I mean we do have our weekly therapy sessions. Yeah. Yeah. You know me, Elijah Wood, Jodie Foster, you know. Yeah. Like we all get together and yeah, we, we, we, we've actually, we do primal screaming. That's what we do. I was describing what it was like. I have a friend who, uh, Ricky Schroder who uh, is, um, you know, obviously it was a very famous when he was young as well. And one of my favorite theme songs, TV theme songs of all time. And I was saying like you, the way you developed is not like the way the recipe calls, like the recipe calls for you to have a childhood and try to figure out life and then become a man and trying to find yourself and then try to find your path. And by the time you he became a man, he was already famous. And the same thing with you.

Speaker 1:          04:13          You were already famous as you were developing and learning. Yeah. I don't know exactly how to like kind of even describe it because it's always the way my life has been kind of thing in the same way that like a lot of kids, like, you know, they'd go out and they catch bugs and play sandlot baseball or whatever. You just look at it like that's the way it is. Like you don't really realize how unique the whole situation is until you have perspective because you have nothing to compare it to really other than I guess tv shows and movies and things like that. So I knew that my upbringing was unique, you know? I knew it knew it was different, but at the same time it's kind of just, it's not until you get some perspective, some life experience, but until you really realize that, oh wait, this, this was particularly. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:58          Weird. So you brought up an interesting what would leopold and leopold this disciple, you know, father of modern wildlife ecology, started the first program of Wildlife Ecology at University of Wisconsin in the 19 forties, populations of deer in the northern part of Wisconsin. We're growing by leaps and bounds and they were dramatically changing the landscape, you know, denuding the landscape, you know, eating eastern white cedar and deer in northern latitudes tend to yard together in the wintertime. And so leopold knew that this was, you know, deleterious to the longterm viability of that ecosystem. He took people out, landowners out hunters out into these deer yards in the spring to show them how there was nothing to eat within reach of a deer on its hind feet. And there were bodies of dead deer that had stopped through the wintertime in order to demonstrate to them the consequences of mismanagement if deer hurts. So he and he was a real proponent of showing people the results of doing things the wrong way and education. So I think yeah, it comes back. So what we're trying to do, not saying that yeah, we're leopold in or anything like that, but education, getting information out, getting accurate information out. It's maybe one of the biggest things we can do.

Speaker 3:          06:23          Like no one ever feels like they're anything special and you always like if there were any good they don't know. And you always ruthlessly self critical and trying to get better. I mean I've worked with big actors, big, Big Rock Stars and the big rockstars, like one big rockstar once one time said to me, I opened. He said, is there anyone out there? I said, ah, like 19,000 people smell the wd 40. That's how they got the last thousand people in. Are you kidding? He said, I'm always worried that no one's going to show up. I said, when was that ever been your problem? He said, well, never, but who is this? Jesus Christ. Yeah. Who's this one of my favorite people. He's a. So He's another guy. He's honest, how many people have those were like in some Floridian, mega done. Hopefully won't be anyone other than him.

Speaker 3:          07:21          Oh No, no, no, no, no, no. And he goes out there and the place goes nuts to show is great of course. And I said, you worry about people don't show up. I get really depressed. And I went, okay. And you know what? I did the beacon theater once many years ago in New York. Beautiful Room. Loved that place. I was, uh, I was, uh, a few days later I was at mtv doing something with like Matt Pinfield or somebody that was living in New York and I'm leaving. And the courtesy lady, she said, Hey, George Carlin is in the green room and he wants to meet you. And I went, wait a minute, dumb question. The George Carlin, because I've been listening to that guy since I was an eighth grade class clown and occupation fool actually came out for me to go to the record store. They were not nice price records. They were what was on.

Speaker 3:          08:12          That's how old I am memorized. And by eighth grade of course. And I said, George Carlin wants to meet me. Okay, walk in, and there's George Carlin, he's there to promote his next hbo thing and he's going to do like, like multiple nights at the beacon theater place. I would never sell out. He's going to do a month or whatever. And he said, Hey, I'm. I said, Mr Carlos [inaudible]. I'm George. I'm like, wow. He said, Oh, you did a book signing the other night at tower records? I said, yeah. He goes, oh man. It was so cool. I was in line for like half an hour and finally I got so cold. I went home. I said, you waited in line to meet me? He's like, yeah. I'm like, why don't you just walk in like, oh, I can't do that man. And he said, so you just at the beacon?

Speaker 3:          08:55          I said, yeah. It was amazing. He said, did they get the jokes? I said, oh, that's not really what I do. I said, I'm sorry, what do you mean? He goes, like, Dee Dee Dee, can you get to the audience from that stage? I said, it's actually a pretty big place. It's a lot his feet to before the first row I said, yeah. I said, you're George Carlin. I think you're going to do okay. But he was sincerely wondering like, is it going to be okay in there? I'm like, are you kidding? You were handcuffed with lenny bruce in the back of a cop car and you're asking me if it's going to be okay. Was He handcuffed? Yeah, it's that great book. A great book. Uh, Ladies and gentlemen, Lenny Bruce,

Speaker 1:          09:36          Alex Jones cannot now go, well, just go to the other youtube. There isn't another residential. You Hey, just go to the other facebook. There isn't another. So we have to recognize that the way we are organized as a society that the town square is now owned by corporations who that need to be regulated. Right? Like before, if you know when 18 t was the phone carrier for everybody, they couldn't go. I'm not going to give Alex Jones a phone service because I don't like the Shit shitty saying. So you know, we, you can't deny services somebody, all that stuff. Just that's not really a valid comparison because the phone service wasn't distributed information to people, right? The phone service is just a method of communication. It was just a utility. What he's able to do through info wars is if you've got them on your platform, he's going to say some things and he's going to use your platform to say some things that you know, might not be true.

Speaker 1:          10:24          It might be crazy. So you've got to decide like when does it become a problem? And I think where they drew the line with Sandy Hook. So here's what I say, Joe, uh, we need to treat these as public utilities because they are right facebook, there is no alternative. There is an alternative to youtube. We need to regulate them. Well, it's a long overdue by the way. And they are monopolies where there's obvious to everyone that they're monopolies. But you know, when you, when you invent something called whatsapp and then facebook buys it for $20, billion dollars, there's a monopoly, there's no way. There's no way to, to compete with these people. So these are monopolies. They need to be regulated and people's need to be protected and it it, it. That's how. That's where we need to go because right now we're leaving it up to the whims of a billion.

Speaker 1:          11:08          Like you'd say, Hey, if Alex Jones really did some shit that was wrong and he should be taken off, or his free speech should be a bridge for it, do it. Let's do it. Go, go to a court or go to a thing or go. People go, well, he docks his people and he did it is if doxing is illegal, he should be prosecuted. If that's what happened, but you shouldn't take away. Did he docs people? That's what they're saying. They're saying he's done. He'd wanted he docs people from newtown or whatever from the school shooting, so that's what they're talking about. The individuals that he gave their addresses and their names. That's what they are saying, that he decay, but let's find out if he actually did that because that sounds crazy. I, I, I'm, I don't know if he did, but we did not saying what he actually did.

Speaker 1:          11:46          This is what's crazy. I keep hearing that he promoted the idea that sandy hook was a false, it was false and that it was a false flag and that these were all actors. I don't know if he actually said that. I think what he actually said was, I don't know if that happened. I think that's what he actually said. People are saying, well, that's promoting the idea that it was a hoax, but I want to know if that's what he really said. See, I don't know if that's even the case because I've heard it. I've heard it written that he promoted the idea that sandy hook was a conspiracy, but I did not quoting. When they say that there's no quotes, there's no. Sandy Hook was a hoax. Those kids were actors. Those kids are not dead. I don't see that anywhere. Right, but they keep attributing that to him without quotation.

Speaker 1:          12:37          But again, if this. If there was some kind of process due process where you could go back and look at the transcript. I know this. Not only that, if during this whole time where he's being tried, he was still labeled to be on youtube and have his videos, he could show in his videos that he didn't say that he could show what he actually said and tell you what he actually said and show clips. He can't do that anymore. So now the narrative is completely in the hands of the mainstream media. One hundred percent. So the Alex Jones narrative is being taken 100 percent out of his hands and now it's in the mainstream media. And now there's sandy hook deniers, conspiracy theorists, right wing lunatic, all these different things. Which mayor, if some of it. I mean Alex, my fucking nuts.
