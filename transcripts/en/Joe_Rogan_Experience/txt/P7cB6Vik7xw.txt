Speaker 2:          00:05:06       the Joe Rogan experience, Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       So, uh, with me today are, uh, Darren foster and Marianna von Zeller. And, um, I first found out about Marianna from the show, uh, on vanguard, the Oxycontin Express, which, uh, I remember watching it in my house and thinking this is the craziest thing I have ever heard in my life. I couldn't believe that all the things you were telling me about the whole system of pain management centers and how it's set up in Florida, it was true. And the statistics on how many people are addicted to Oxycontin, how many prescriptions are being given out for Oxycontin in Florida is just absolutely bananas. And I watched an I and I said, this is so far beyond out of control that it's amazing that I'm just hearing about it now from a documentary on current TV, which is like, you know, not the most widely viewed channel. I mean I felt like this should be on every channel, on the front page of every newspaper. There's a hijack and going on down there. They've hijacked the legal system somehow or another and absolutely willfully put these things into position in order to extract money and do it at the expense of all these people being addicted. I mean, how did you find out about this and how did you go about doing that piece?

Speaker 3:          00:06:45       It's interesting you say that. I mean, it was exactly the same for us. The same surprise that we got when we started looking into the story, we found a little news clipping on one newspaper about some deaths in Florida because of prescription drugs. And some of them were more pain clinics around and Mcdonald's. And we thought, wow, this is really interesting. We should investigate this. And we started looking into it and then we found out that there were seven people every day dying from prescription pill abuse that all over the u s are more people dying from a prescription pill, overdoses and heroin, cocaine and ecstasy combined that just last year it's surpassed car accidents to become the number one cause of accidental deaths in the United States. So this was the story that we could just going to turn our heads away from mine.

Speaker 1:          00:07:26       God, when, when I watched it, I went to work and I told all these people about it. I was like, you gotta see this. This is crazy. And they, they didn't believe me, like when I was saying I go, do you know, in Florida you can go to a doctor and get a prescription and then they don't have a database. You can go to another doctor across the street and get a new prescription and just ping pong your way back and forth, down the highway and they're everywhere.

Speaker 3:          00:07:51       You know, the most insane thing was that we spoke to the local journalist who had sort of covered this story a little bit and they told us, look, you'll go by pain clinics here and you'll see lines of people and out of state cars parked outside and literally lines of people, I mean very long lines around the corner of people waiting to get into these pain clinics to get these prescription drugs. And we thought, okay, this is the kind of thing that you hear about. We'll never be able to film worth witness ourselves. And then, and then it was easy. I mean we, as soon as we left the airport, went straight to this one street that we knew had a lot of pain clinics and there it was, the parking lot's full of out of state plates. I mean people driving all the way from Kentucky, Ohio as far off as Massachusetts down to Florida to buy their pills and they pack their car with Pete cars with people, and then they bring them back and sell them for five, 10 times the price that they buy them in Florida. So it's a racket.

Speaker 1:          00:08:40       It's so hard to believe when, when, when I watched your show, it was, it was so hard to wrap my head around the fact that there was one area that was so completely out of control because where I grew up on the east coast or here in California, I've never seen anything like that and I never had any inkling that this was something that had to be dealt with somewhere. So watching that was a, wow, you really freak me out.

Speaker 3:          00:09:05       It was when we tried to film one of the lines when you, there was this one pain clinic that had that, a lot of people like going to, because it was super easy to get drugs basically you just go in and out and get whatever you wanted. And we started filming outside and we set our tripod and we were across the street on the other side of this. Um, sort of, it wasn't a freeway was sort of a, a big street. And uh, as soon as we started filming these, these guys come out and they start chasing us and they asked us what we were doing and we said, you know, we were just filming out here. Big Guys, big guys, I mean big, big guys. Um, and um, they started chasing us and we ran out of gas cause every time he's tried to stop and get gas in our car, we were running low. They would get out of the car and it was just me, Darren and our other producers, Teresa and I was freaked out the night before I'd been watching the sopranos and I really felt like I was apart of the soprano's. I felt, Oh my God, we've been, we traveled all around the world and warzones and we're going to be killed right here in Florida, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida because we were filming a pain clinic. It was,

Speaker 4:          00:10:05       but those guys, those guys were actually later indicted. They were, um, busted by the DA and they were late indicted, but in the indictment that found that the head made like $40 million in two years off these pain clinics and they're, they're in jail for like 17 years now because I think one of them was even, um, convicted of like hiring someone to, to, uh, kill to take out somebody else.

Speaker 3:          00:10:24       Yeah. Gun for hire. I mean, these were dangerous people. These were not people that you

Speaker 4:          00:10:28       yes or no. Not good people always getting in behind the, these Iraqi.

Speaker 1:          00:10:32       So when you ran out of gas, what happened? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:10:34       Until we ran out of gas and I had just entered, we just interviewed some line forcement there and we had, he was calling nine one one I was calling the contact that we had for law enforcement there and saying please help us. We don't know what to do and it means I'm the nine one one. I mean that we were about five

Speaker 4:          00:10:49       minutes later we were on a nine to five. And so like highway patrol just saw that we were pulled over anyway and they, they came and then,

Speaker 3:          00:10:54       but we stopped and then the other guy stopped behind us and they didn't come out of the car cause I think they realized that we were calling nine one one but they just, they just stayed there and it was just to intimidate us. So they stay there and then they'd made the story up to the police that uh, we had been stalking, stalking them, that they had an ex girlfriend that was talking them. So they thought that we were stock, they ex girlfriend or something.

Speaker 4:          00:11:15       But it's pretty warm too, bro. She's filming cause she wants, I mean you do have stalker tendencies coming from my husband.

Speaker 1:          00:11:25       Wow. So, um, the non database thing, that has to be a criminal thing. I mean there's no way that I could in this day and age, there's no way that could be by accident. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:11:35       Yeah. You know, they, they did pass a, um, a drug control plan. There they are now that is in place. What does that mean? It means that now doctors, they have a database and plan but in, in place basically that they are supposed to check to see if a customer is coming or a client is coming to get more drugs so that you can't go what's called doctor shopping from pain clinic, pain clinic or pharmacy to pharmacy to get all these meds. Um, however it's not mandatory, but I mean it's far better right now in Florida than it was back when we went. And what's happening with them? Mandatory.

Speaker 4:          00:12:10       Yeah. I mean it all has to do like these privacy laws, you know, like they don't want your medical records to be accessible to the government basically. Right. And so, you know, people that are very, I guess worried about our privacy, um, which, you know, maybe we think about differently now with the whole NSA scandal. Little. I mean like, you know, people are definitely, um, that's, that's the resistance to, to do in the prescription monitoring programs and a lot of places. But most states have them these days. Florida was one of the biggest states that didn't have one for a long time. Um, but now with the, obviously you know, so many people dying of this and there's the sort of bad reputation in the state was getting, um, they decided to do something

Speaker 3:          00:12:48       press down a little bit, but it's still happening. And two years after we did that Oxycontin Express, we actually were filming a story about heroin abuse in Massachusetts and how, because of the oxycontin epidemic, a lot of kids, um, then went on to do heroin for whatever reason because oxy was getting more expensive or it was harder to get their hands on oxy. So then they started shooting up heroin because the effects are sort of the same on, on the, on the body. Except, you know, it's a street drugs in many ways it's extremely dangerous as well. Um, and so we actually went to a guy's house who was selling heroin and he said, dude, I'm selling hearing, but what I really like to sell his spills and we, we go down, me and my friends all go down to Florida and get a bunch of these and we make much more money. Our profit margin is much higher by selling pills and it is selling heroin. So we much prefer to that. Wow. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:13:38       that's hilarious. It's pretty 2013. It's uh, it's really shocking to me that that hasn't been addressed and that you're not seeing people talk about that in the mainstream media. Like the president never get fields questions on the prescription pill problem this country. And why is this happening and have you investigated? What factors are involved here or they're dirty doctors. Are there, are they in cahoots with the pharmacy companies? Like, what, how is it possible that there's, they did a thing on Montana recently in the Montana, the billings daily gazette or something that one of the billings daily newspapers where they said that out of 1 million people, it Montana 240,000 new prescriptions had been written.

Speaker 4:          00:14:25       Well, I mean it's one of the things that definitely drew us to that, to see that story and to, to follow up stories that we've done subsequently is, is the fact that, you know, like we spend billions of dollars every year fighting a war on drugs, just trying to prevent drugs coming into this country. But meanwhile it's the drugs that are being made in this country, um, that are causing the biggest, you know, problems in terms of lives lost and stuff like that. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:49       The war on drugs is playing cowboys and Indians and pretending you're doing genocide. I mean, is the worst job ever of controlling drugs that anybody's ever done ever. When you stop and think about how much resources to results, it's so damn stupid. It's like all you're doing is arrest in pot dealers. Why don't you just call it the war on people probably won't shoot you and you can make arrests. You make them count. You know, how many people were they arresting that are involved in these pill clinics? How many people they're investing that are in involved in the pharmaceutical companies. So obviously bribing local lawmakers to make these laws. I mean that's, that is one of the creepiest state laws I've ever heard in my life. But it's not surprising that it's coming from Florida. Like if you wanted to have a crazy place where you would think that that would go, you go.

Speaker 1:          00:15:36       Yeah. Yeah. I always say the Florida is like the South Mexico, you know, like we always look at Mexico like, oh those God Mexico, he think about all the crime that goes on there and all the craziness and the shenanigans we always look at like Florida is like the south is that part of this country and the Florida is like that to the south. Like they'll like Jesus Christ Florida. Yeah. Whenever it was stuck for a story where he's like, what's going on in Florida? If it wasn't for Florida, Nancy Grace, it have nothing to talk about. It's a crazy, crazy place right. Now, when you guys aired this and you, you put this with, was there any resistance? Did people give you a hard time about this?

Speaker 5:          00:16:14       No, actually it's been an incredible in the past, I mean this air to three years ago already and I still get, um, weekly I get emails or Facebook messages or people reaching out because they've been somewhat, they've watched this and somehow they've been affected by drugs, by prescription drugs. You know, their son has died, their husband is addicted and they reach out. Um, because this, this, this documentary has made an impact on them and they, um, and they want to, to let us know, which is fantastic. You know, as a, as a journalist, that's the best kind of gift you can get.

Speaker 1:          00:16:44       Yeah. That's beautiful. Now you guys did an amazing job. Like I said, you completely enlightened me on the subject. I had literally no idea before I saw your show that this was even an issue. I had thought about, you know, people need pills, like they get hurt. And then I remember reading the rush limbo thing and I'd be like, that crazy bastard. Like, what the fuck is he doing? He's taking like 99 a day or something nutty. Like that wasn't a, do you know that number?

Speaker 5:          00:17:08       I don't know the number, but I know some people, you know, that we've interviewed have, you know, gotten quite tolerant to the, to the pills and they could take a huge number, like a surprisingly, a huge number.

Speaker 1:          00:17:20       He was going with his housekeeper. He was having his housekeeper go around and collect them for him. And then apparently that's how he got popped. The whole thing was just, I was like, well, this just this crazy fat guy. Of course he's got a skeleton or two in his closet. That guy's an asshole, you know, like he's so judgmental and evil and the way he goes after, you know, all these, uh, the, the liberals and the Democrats, I was like, of course, that guy's fucking crazy. Of course he's on pills. Then when you hear that he did so much that he lost his hearing? Like somebody had to describe it to me in medical terms. He did so much oxycontin that he blew out his hearing.

Speaker 3:          00:17:55       Wow. I mean, I don't know if you remember, but the tod, the main guy in our, in our, in our documentary, the oxy got an express. He was this kid, he was 28 at the time, but he started doing oxies 10 years before he lost his brother to Oxycontin. He lost his wife to bills and you could see, I mean, and recently he died last year as well, um, from drug overdose. And you know, you could tell just by talking to him, to him that he, his mind was just not there and his, his mom was constantly telling us like she, he couldn't remember things. He, he was totally fried and it was all because of pills, the amount of pills he was doing and he was taking an insane amount. I remember him telling us, what was it like, you remember the teen 80 milligrams or that would just, I don't remember lead you consulted a doctor afterwards and told him how much this guy was taking and he couldn't believe it. He said that, you know, obviously if any of us decided to take that amount today, we would die in a second because we just don't have that tolerance.

Speaker 1:          00:18:49       Yeah. I have, uh, one of my, well I had one of my best friends died from it, um, that and actual heroin and uh, you know, a bunch of other things and he was doing, but it was just, I've seen people caught in the grips of physical addiction and it's a terrifying, terrifying thing. I've never experienced it myself. Um, I, the only thing that I've, that I've ever taken that's really addictive as coffee and, um, I guess alcohol to certain people, but although it's never been to me, um, but I've always been terrified of the actual addictive properties. It's something becoming a part of your system, not an impulsive addiction like gambling, which I'm scared of that stuff too. Um, cause I'm a very impulsive person, but the, the, the terrifying notion of seeing it get into your bones, which is what these pills do and it's, it's so just evil. Like it's almost like vampires in a pill form. It just slowly sucks your life away and absolutely forces you to take it.

Speaker 3:          00:19:48       You know, I'm from Europe, from Portugal and in Europe it's only prescribed to critically ill cancer patients. So it's, it was so surprising to me to see how easily they're prescribed here.

Speaker 1:          00:19:58       Yeah. That's because well it's because of money. I mean it has to be. I got um, my nose fixed. I had a deviated septum and my doctor gave me a prescription afterwards over of two different types of painkillers and I told them I go, it doesn't even hurt because it, it really didn't hurt. Like everybody had told me, it was like incredibly painful and all my God, you're barely going to be able to deal. Then I got out of there, I was like, this is it. I was like, I feel like I have a stuff nose. Like it doesn't hurt at all. And it was because my nose has been packed with these things, but he was like, you need pain pills. And I'm like, listen man, I just got done telling you that I'm not even in pain. What did he give you? He gave me vicodins and I think it was percocets. I didn't take it though, but I just threw the prescriptions. Why? I'm scared of that shit. Um, I have a buddy who had a, um, a problem with drugs and then he had back surgery and then after he had back surgery, they put them on pills, you know, to give him one. And they're like, look, you need prescription medication. They didn't even take into consideration the fact that he used to be a junkie and so immediately as problem again, you know, it was all shady and weird now.

Speaker 4:          00:20:58       Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the unfortunate, it's the way it starts with so many people is it that they're an injury. And that's why you see like in a lot of places where the, where the problem is is that it's around places that have like a lot of workplace injuries like evaled Aisha where people worked at the mines and stuff like that or get like closer to that. Sorry. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. Uh, yeah. So I mean that's a lot of times where we see these clusters of, of people who have, uh, uh, become addicted.

Speaker 1:          00:21:21       Yeah. And it's, so, unfortunately, it's like that is where, you know, you're, you're finding these lower income people, middle class people who worked factory jobs and have to move things, manual labor type jobs. And it just seems like they have no hope. Like once they get caught up in that, it's so hard to get out from under the grip of that monster and they don't have, they can't afford to take a month off and go to Malibu to some clinic where they're going to feed them green tea and rub their feet. You know, like people are, they get, they're doomed. Like you can get stock and the amount of willpower required to pull yourself out of that mud is insane.

Speaker 3:          00:21:56       It is. I mean, we spoke to so many people who were getting better and they, we really, I mean they really, they had this conviction that they were, this was it. They were talking to us as, as x drug addicts and they were never going to take pills again. And I would say that 99% of those went back to drugs.

Speaker 1:          00:22:13       Did you know this is a statistic that somebody put on my message board? Um, a dude named evil homer. Thanks Eva Homer, that last year, five pharmaceutical companies were agreed to pay 5.5 billion to resolve the US Department of Justice allegations of fraudulent, fraudulent marketing practices, including the promotion of medications for uses that there were not approved by the food and Drug Administration. Insane. I mean, if you go back and look at the numbers that they've been paying, like Pfizer in 2009 was fine. 2.3 billion. And this is so many of them. There's Glaxo Smith Kline, 3 billion and it's not, the pharmaceutical drugs haven't done great things. There's amazing applications for pharmaceutical drugs that have changed people's lives for the better. Yeah. It's just so unfortunate that it's a, uh, it's the bottom line over morality, over humanity. The bottom line being ones and zero's collect as many as you can above humanity and it's, it's not necessary. It's like there's plenty of valid applications for drugs, but if you want to control the entire world and you want to be like the king of the planet and have all the, all the gold, like the best way to do it is to be like fuck people. Just treat them as little, you know, vampires sucklings and take as much blood as he can while keeping them alive for as long as he can until they eventually run out of money or blood and then move on to the next one.

Speaker 3:          00:23:38       We spoke to a doctor, he was a rehab doctor and he told us something really interesting. I think it wasn't the end of the nineties that the medical got together and they decided that the best thing to do, to treat pain was to really go at it aggressively and have the lowest possible tolerance to pain. So if, uh, if there was any chance that the patient would feel any sort of feign just treated aggressively by giving them a lot of drugs and he says there was a total shift, uh, in the end of the, uh, the nine, the 90s, wasn't it Darren? End of the 19th, I believe it was. And um, and that's when pain pills started being dispensed. It dispense much more liberally. And I think at the time they didn't really, really realize what this, you know, the, the addictive side of this and what this could do.

Speaker 1:          00:24:22       How is it possible though? How's it possible that they could have not known? I don't buy that. Like everyone's known that from the time I was a kid, I knew that people had problems with quail. Ludes you would hear about that all the time. I didn't even know what a quail lewd was, you know, but I remember people always on Ludes, the guy's got a problem with ludes. So of course they knew they're full of shit. They must've bowed down to pressure from the pharmaceutical companies. There must, must've been someone to cut a deal and said, listen, if you guys just prescribed a little more, do you know how much money were you going on Mac? And we'll give you a little bit of this, a little bit of that. People say, well that doesn't happen. Well, here's one thing that definitely does happen. My wife, uh, her mom is a nurse and, um, her mom was working at this clinic and she would tell us about the drug reps and all the things that drug reps would do for the company.

Speaker 1:          00:25:07       They take the whole company out to dinner to a really nice restaurant. Like, you know, nurses are on very reasonable salaries. Like they can't afford like a really expensive restaurant or really a fine restaurant. They'll take everybody out by them, all the drinks, order anything on the menu, lobster and steak and this and that. And they did it on a regular basis. They gave them trips and all sorts of other things and they made it everybody like really eager to prescribe these drugs, get to keep the drug reps around, keep, keep the vacation's coming in, you know, keep the lobster dinners coming. It's amazing. Right. It's amazing. And it's amazing that it takes someone like you guys to, to expose this like where's CNN, where are these so called investigative journalists that are supposed to be looking out for us, you know, where are the people that uncovered Watergate where, where are the people that were really looking out for America? Like, what the fuck happened? What happened to journalism in this country?

Speaker 4:          00:25:57       Well, I mean like for us, I mean, you know, it's great. Local reporting is what drew us to the story. So, um, they're all great reports but for some reason, yeah. Some local guys, yes, we have on the scene people on the scene and like that's, you know, we got the lead to this story and so, um, yeah, why it doesn't get better. National attention is a definitely a question that I said we should all be asking. Yes. Well it's like w you know, you,

Speaker 1:          00:26:19       when you hear that the CIA gives gigantic news, corporations like Fox and CNBC gives them talking points and that they follow these talking points and then you hear that these stories are going on and no one's reporting it. Meanwhile, they'll pay attention to, you know, Kim Kardashians baby will be like the, the lead on CNN, Kim Guard ash hand. Remember bird just harder. And did they make it seem like that as Florida is the fucking apocalypse parts of Florida that like if, if it was just a Zombie factory and then people went in and turned, came out as zombies, you'd be like, oh well we have to stop this. They, they're becoming zombies. But did they are fucking becoming zombies. They're becoming functional zombies. Yeah. Who can sort of walk around and live amongst you as long as they keep getting their Zombie medicine.

Speaker 3:          00:27:06       Yeah. We had that great sheriff in our, in our doc say that, um, you know, talk about these doctors and how they were, uh, what was it that he said there were drug dealers, drug dealers with degrees, which is such a great way of fitting in. And they are, I mean, they know what they're doing. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:27:20       You, you, the other thing that you exposed when you show these pains, Matt, pain management centers is that some of them, they're actually connected to pharmacies. Yeah. It is for, for folks would be, first of all folks, if you haven't seen the documentary, you must. And where can they watch? It isn't an online line where they get it.

Speaker 3:          00:27:35       You can actually go to [inaudible] dot TV, which is mk.tv and you seeK and u c k. Dot. TV. It's our production company and we have all our work there. And the oxycontin express is feature there.

Speaker 1:          00:27:45       Beautiful. It's a Mussy. It's so enlightening. But the, the pain management centers, you'd go there and you say, hey man, my back hurts. And they go, well you definitely need some oxycontin and just go three feet down the hall and open up that next door. And that's the prescription place. And you go in there and the pharmacy hooks you up and it's like one stop shopping for drugs and it's legal cash only cash, only cash, only insurance, not that accepted cash only. And so that's what happened to us. We went,

Speaker 3:          00:28:14       we went undercover, we put it, you've got an undercover camera and went into one of these and it was I think the first pain clinic we went into. And I just asked the receptionist so I have a back pain, what can I get? And she said, oh well they'll be able to prescribe you oxycontin. And she listed the, the long list of drugs and you just need to go get an Mri. And basically what this is is that an MRI can show anything and you can point to something and say that that's what's hurting you. And did the doctors just need to see something that they can then say, look, I looked at the MRI and it looked like she had that. It was legitimate back pain and that's all they need. And so we went out the door to get this, to get this MRI and we stopped and start talking to these guys that had come to get down from West Virginia and Kentucky and they were telling us, you know, we traveled down there here cause it's just so easy to get these drugs and we just say we have a back pain.

Speaker 3:          00:29:02       But of course we don't have anything. We just want to take a lot. A lot of these rugs back home with us when

Speaker 1:          00:29:07       people are listening to this and saying, well how easy ready for this doctors in Florida prescribed 10 times more oxycodone pills than every other state in the country. Column bind. Yeah, red flags all around. But if you smoked pot in Florida, they'll put you in a cage son. They would lock you up in a box, throw away the key. What are your damn hippie trail? Ruin your life. You've got problems. Go to the pain management clinic, get a nice American cocktail of opiates. The, have you guys ever seen the documentary, the documentary, the wild and wonderful whites of West Virginia? Yes. Beautiful and sad at the same time and hilarious. Look, if you can't do anything about it and you just accept that going in, you have to, you can't look at it and say, Oh that poor child growing up cause then you'll get all sad.

Speaker 1:          00:30:05       But if you can treat it as a comedy and pretend to not real and treat it as like if you're watching a Coen brothers movie, a big part of that documentary is pills. Yeah. Huge part of what those people are. And that culture of wild hillbilly white trash crazy people is about is about pill addiction. Yeah. We spoke to some people in jail, some women in jail that were in jail because of pill trafficking from Florida and they called themselves pill billies. Yes. What a great name. Hilda Hillbilly. Hillary and heroin. Yeah. Appalachian. Yeah. It's uh, it's really confusing and it to, to have it all exposed and one piece like yours and just all of a sudden be like, why? It's like that's out there. It's was a real paradigm shifting moment for me. And it was the thing that really got me paying attention to pills in general.

Speaker 1:          00:31:00       And then I started reading all these other bizarre stories like, I dunno if you've ever heard about the man, um, who, uh, was awarded, uh, the equivalent of 600,000 American dollars because a, he was on a Parkinson's drug called a Requip and this was by a Glaxo Smith Kline. They had this Parkinson's drug and it turns him into a gambling and gay sex addict who was a straight man and he took this pill and it was Parkinson's drug. So apparently it has some psychoactive properties. So that's something to the way the mind works. And all he wanted to do was have gay sacks and gamble. Yeah. Brilliant. But I mean he got 600,000, so it's not like just an accusation, it's an accusation backed up by at least some science. I mean, I don't know what they use to show that there's some sort of a chemical correlation between his activities and this drug, but they pulled the drug off the market.

Speaker 1:          00:31:59       The drug doesn't exist anymore. And so he got his $600,000 in gambling. He got off the Parkinson's medication and it became a straight man again without a gambling problem. But with $600,000 in his pocket and a lot of bad memories. A lot of horrible, horrible gay sex gambling memories. Yeah, it is weird. But it's just how did, I mean they, there's, there's so many drugs like those late night things, you know those commercials you see for those shady legal guys, two o'clock in the morning like did you take phen phen in the eighties you know, call this number and we will get you the money that you deserve. It's just shocking. How easy is for these things to get prescribed or for these things to get approved. Like how much testing is involved, do you, do I, did you guys ever find out as far as like how much testing is involved in making something?

Speaker 3:          00:32:50       So the interesting thing is that when all these pain pills start at being produced, such as Oxycontin, they were really easy to manipulate so that you can use them. They have this time release. Um, um, so that when you, you, when you take a pill, they will have an effect on your body, but over time, and that was really easy to manipulate so that you would take it and it would immediately have all the effect at once, which was, which is what an addict ultimately wants. Um, so then, uh, they were heavily criticized for that. So then they came up with a pill that was it. So easy to manipulate and um, but then, you know, that was easy. They, they found a way around that to, addicts found a way around that too. And we, we, you just go online and you search how to manipulate. Then you walk sees and it's, you put them, there were ways, I remember addicts telling us that you just put them in a microwave and do all this certain kinds of things. And I'm not going to say here because I'm not trying to get people to do it, but that, that there are ways to manipulate every line. So even when they try to play it safe, um, you know, there's always a way around it for an addict,

Speaker 1:          00:33:55       why are they smoking them?

Speaker 4:          00:33:58       Yeah, just, I mean it's the quickest way to get it into your body to adjust it. You get it all at once, you know, it just same as snorting and crushing and snorting end. Did you just get it all at once? Like Marianne was saying, it was initially made as a time release formula so that it would sort of fall out over eight hours, 12 hours, something like that. But if you crush it and just, nor did you get all the active ingredient once all the oxycodone at Watson. Thank you Darren. You were much better at explaining that is having a hard time, but as soon as what people like freebase cocaine, right, or small crack and stuff like that. It just, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:34:30       it's um, it's, it's really kind of a brave new world type thing, isn't it? It really is sort of a, a horrific version of the future thing. These numbers, like especially the, the Florida number of 10 times the number of prescriptions for oxycodone on the nene tire country combined. I thought before I read it like I saw, I bet. I Bet Florida is certainly number one, but probably only about like 50% or something like that. That's, that was my silly little idea 10 times. I think there's also a number that the, the, uh, there are a hundred doctors at most prescribed Oxycontin in America or 99 of them are in Florida or something like that, which is, Ooh, Ooh, powerful Florida. What's that? Yeah. Back. Yeah. Back then. It's changed somewhat now. Yeah. But you know, I'm torn on these things because a part of me is I'm a huge fan of personal freedom and I'm a huge fan of civil liberties and I think, I think if you want to be an idiot and ruin your life, you should be able to be an idiot and ruin your life.

Speaker 1:          00:35:29       And I, there's a lot of things that would ruin some people's life that I enjoy. Like whiskey. I like whiskey. I like, like having a couple of shots, but I'm not a drug addict and I'm not an alcoholic, so I can have a couple shots of whiskey and stop and that's it. I don't need them every day. And I, you know, I can do it once a year if I really wanted to, but I'm also really keenly aware that I don't know what I'm talking about because I've never done an opiate. Did you guys ever consider

Speaker 5:          00:35:56       trying it? Yes. No, no, no. Um, you know, we, we, we, we, we like to immerse ourselves in stories, but not that far. Yeah. Yeah. We went, we went to Brazil for example. We did a story about the Campbell frog. Uh, we did, we did it would say a drug that does all this sort of things to your blood stream and it's supposed to be really good for you. But, um, it's, it's crazy. It's the skin of a frog that gets dried and then you punctured a little hole in your body and you put the skin there, uh, the skin of the frog, of the secretion of the frog. And then it gives you sort of a burst of energy. You feel your blood coming up and down, all over your brain. It seems like your brain is about to explode. Um, and it has a lot of pharmaceutical promise.

Speaker 5:          00:36:37       This, um, this, this particular frog Campbell Campbell for, okay. How actually, how do you spell that? K. A. N. B. O. K. And that's it. And it's beautiful frog. It is actually a beautiful giant, really green for Alagan. Yeah. So it creates this chemical, um, and it's, you know, sort of slimy that slime they take and they dry it out and then they, yeah, they do like a crude injection of like burning you. So it's the, the, the native drives down there that they use it as sort of like a, uh, or a cleansing ritual, but it doesn't, it's not hallucinogenic or anything like that. It, it just, um, but what, what attracts like medicine to it is that it breaks the, the, the blood brain barrier. So it's like, I dunno what that exactly means, but it's very attractive to science, but they haven't figured out how they're going to use it yet. I think it's going to be good for heart disease to treat heart disease. Wow. Yeah. And so that was, uh, we, we definitely immersed ourselves. It's not a tough one. I don't think

Speaker 1:          00:37:33       it's another sign of how crazy human beings are. This one spot in the world like Brazil, the rain forest where there's so much promise as far as like new healing, new plants that can do all sorts of great things. And what are they doing to just sharpen it down? Just hacking it down at a record pace.

Speaker 5:          00:37:53       It's insane. We've done several stories about that and it's just insane. It's so sad. Every time we go back,

Speaker 1:          00:37:58       so many different wonder cures have been found in, in the rain forest. Like they're always looking for the rain forest to come up with a new new medications for all sorts of things. And you know, there's the good side of the pharmaceutical companies, the fact that pharmaceutical companies are creating things that are helping keep your grandpa around for longer and you know, and keep people healthy. It's such a double edged sword. And like I said, for me it's, I'm so torn because I would, I don't think that I would want to be in a neighborhood where they're selling heroin, but I don't think that anybody should be able to tell anybody else they can't buy heroin. But then you get into that area of the addictive properties of it and that's where it gets sketchy. That's where it gets like, well, if you're going to do anything as a community to try to stop something like that, boy, there's, there's not a lot of ways you can convince people to not do things.

Speaker 1:          00:38:49       It's very difficult and it gets real weird when you're trying to convince someone to not do something that has a really good chance of ruining your life. Absolutely. And I know you talk a lot about drugs and I don't know if you've looked into the portrait piece experience. I'm from Portugal and Portugal, basically one of the biggest experiments in drug policy in the world and it Meson for 10 years and it's actually quite a success rate. And what they did is they did to claimant decriminalize drugs, they didn't legalize them, they decriminalized them. Meaning that if you're caught where they think it's one gram of heroin or cocaine, 100 gram of heroin, two grams of cocaine or 25 grams of marijuana, if it's anything, if it's that or less, you don't go to jail as you as you do in other countries. And what they do is they send you to a drug Rehab Commission and to a group of doctors that know what they're talking about, that want to find out if this is the first time you're trying drugs and why are you doing them.

Speaker 1:          00:39:41       And they try to address the problem as a disease and not as a crime. And it's had actually great success rate and a much less people are going to rehab centers, much less people are dying. So it's definitely being looked at as um, as a way to go in terms of drug policy. Well, that's a beautiful idea also in terms of human nature, because it's human nature to not want to be controlled. There's, there's many, many examples and if you have children, you know that if you know one of the best ways to get a kid to want to do something, just tell them they can't do it. It's a, it's a natural human tendency to try to resist and when you tell them they can do whatever they want and the old you'll be there to help them like you're, you're honestly better off.

Speaker 1:          00:40:20       And we would like to think that the established laws that we have in this country are set up to protect people, but they're clearly not. When you're dealing with these numbers, especially outside of Florida, like I told you about billings, Montana newspaper, talking about 240,000 different prescriptions for that stuff in, in Montana alone, it's obviously not the case. This is not, it's not that anybody is trying to look out for anybody. It's just simply a matter of a crazy system where it's become this, there's this weird sort of method that you can do to skirt logical thinking and extract money from, from humans and, and you can do it in this is a really immoral, horrible way by getting them addicted to these things and the fact that doctors are in on it. That's what the, that's the weirdest aspect of it, that, that these people who supposedly had dedicated their lives to helping people and that's what their whole career was supposed to be, improving the health of people, keeping people alive and then somewhere along the line in the whole storm of student loans and, and, and getting sued for malpractice and all this different shit, they, they somewhere along the line of bunch of them just crack and they just go, let's just make some money.

Speaker 1:          00:41:39       Yeah. We spoke to some addicts in a Florida who's doctor? The one that the doctor prescribed them. The drugs was, and this was a kid, actually a boy, a man, a 25 year old kid was a gynecologist. So he was going to a gynecologist to get his meds. Whoa. Well, if anybody would know. Wow, that's so crazy. This story is also close to me because besides my friend who died, I had another family member that had nothing wrong with them. He was a completely normal, great guy, and then got injured in a work accident and became the biggest fuck up I have ever met in my life. And it's, it's hard for me to even imagine that this is the same guy I knew from high school. He was a, at one point in time as a hard worker. He was a great kid. He was always friendly.

Speaker 1:          00:42:27       And then he just became a complete loser of compulsive liar. Anything you could do to get bills. And, uh, so I, I've, I've seen the first hand affects of someone who didn't have an issue. Like he didn't have any physical issues. He also didn't have any family history of people, people being addicted to anything. So it was just a monster got into a system. I understand what you say that a person should be able to get whatever they want. If they're adults and they can make up their own lines, but they should also be able to know what they're getting too many times the problem, again, the injuries, a big problems, big reason why people get into prescription drugs is because they're prescribed this by their doctor and there aren't enough warnings as to how addictive this stuff can be. And then, you know, we spoke to one kid who was also a star athlete in college and he was featured in the second documentary we did about this issue and he was in the hospital for five days and he left us the hospital.

Speaker 1:          00:43:24       He was already addicted to pills and never left. And I was shooting heroin. Wow. It's so crazy. So this is a story. I know a story. So just imagine how many stories there are out there. Just people that get injured and get addicted. And how do we stop this? Is there a way, is it too far into the, the, the cultural system? I mean, is it a part of us now? I don't think so. I think a lot, not more. It needs to be done and they're fantastic people out there. A lot of moms, actually mothers was lost. Kids who are leading the way and trying to raise awareness and pass legislation. I definitely think that more needs to be done. More doctors need to prescribe the US, uh, know what they're prescribing and uh, you know, uh, people know, need to know more about what they're being prescribed in the addictive addictiveness of it.

Speaker 1:          00:44:11       Wow. It's, um, it's, to me it's one of the most disturbing aspects of our culture. It's one of the most disturbing. It's second only to war know the idea that there's this massive corporations that are profiting off of these people becoming zombies. It's, uh, it's really, really crazy. So I want to thank you very much for doing that document because you guys really, you knocked it out of the park and he changed the way I look at it. So this new show you're doing, it's called a inside secret America. It's on Nat Geo. And does it aired yet? Does it start? It starts Wednesday night. This one's day. This was in it

Speaker 5:          00:44:46       safety and that is the first episode. Oh, awesome. And what is the show? What's, what are you guys doing on the first one is drugs from them. I actually synthetic drugs. So we look into sort of a bath salts and spice and k two and all that stuff. And the show is basically a Darren who's my producing partner and my husband and myself. We go around America exploring an ill infiltrating these uh, subcultures. Some of the West is most, um, controversial subcultures and everything from sex trafficking to unregulated and illegal guns to the first episode, which is about synthetic drugs. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:45:26       Did you guys follow the John Mcafee case? Yeah, I made a little bit. I saw the, the vice guys were down there. Did you follow the drug aspect of it? So I've heard about it, but I'm not like to uh, up to speed on what was going on. But I heard it was, he was like making his own like stuff. Right. I have no idea. Well that's awesome. And this is the entrance of all fairness. He says that it was all troll and then he was just joking about the drug part. But the reality is he had a laboratory set up in his backyard in Billy's like a real legit laboratory. And inside that laboratory, I don't know what he was actually doing, but he made a post under a pseudonym on this drug forum describing his freebasing of bath salts. And his, uh, he did some work with, I dunno, I dunno what the technical aspects of his, uh, t is transformation of the bath salts and the something else.

Speaker 1:          00:46:23       But he had claimed that it made you this incredibly hypersexual a person and he was trying to market it as like, like, uh, he was trying to come up with a drug that would turn women into like Nymphomaniacs essentially doubled the female Viagra. Yeah. Sort. SORTA, but Viagra doesn't make you a raw. Yeah, but, but you know what I mean? Like vi Viagara is an aid to a man achieving an erection. But it doesn't necessarily make you like a horny person. Right. Whereas this was a a mental thing like who change you, make you very, very, very aroused and you know, he did describes on the Webs, his post is like, you know, clawing your genitals and like freaking out masturbating all day. And I mean he, he had these really detailed depictions of the chemical transformation of these drugs and clearly had this massive laboratory, well not massive but like really high end high tech laboratory set up and his crazy fucking jungle house. And this guy was cooking bath salts back there. I mean the doctors we spoke to, he definitely said that like hypersexuality is, is one of the sort symptoms, not symptoms. What the side effects, side effects or benefits, benefits, however you wanna describe it of Batsauce. Yeah. And depending how you slice it, I wonder who he was starting to think

Speaker 3:          00:47:39       for these drugs. I know they're for women but with men by these drugs to give to their wives and girls.

Speaker 1:          00:47:43       Friends are always, well what he was doing, it was good. He had like a bunch of young girls from this, you know, it was Billy's a third world country. I guess sort of developing the PC way. So he had these, you know, young jungle girls like 20 years old or however the where like I think his girlfriend was 20. And he was like, you know, had all these pictures of these different girls that he was getting hooked up on bath salts. Crazy dude. We had him on the podcast when he's actually on the run. Yeah, yeah, yeah. After he was being charged with murder, he fled the country and he was calling us, I think it was caused from Mexico on a, um, uh, one of those little Kmart cell phones that you buy are very nervous. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so he was, he called into the podcast and spoke to us for like an hour.

Speaker 1:          00:48:27       It was fascinating too. We asked him about the drugs and he was saying that you can't believe everything you read. I am a notorious Prankster, you know, I think that was his, it's just, just fun and hey, I know that's how I prank when I prank I set up a lab and a fucking do it hardcore, man. I make you really believe that I'm cooking bass off. Meanwhile, I'm just back there with some like glitter and glue and I mean he made like this really like high resolution photographs. It was work and detailed the whole process. So if he was a troll, like man, he's a really well thought out troll. He's a, he's a character and a half. But um, the bath salts aspects where one of the parts of the whole story where they just sort of painted him like this maniac. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:49:13       Some of the names of these bath salts are just insane. Yeah. We were able to actually acquire some just that smoke shops here in southern California that were, one was called Scooby Doo. The other one, the sec called sexy Zombie. And we need it. We went into smoke shop and bought this stuff. And then we were actually, uh, so our first episode we actually filmed some, um, uh, we feature some, uh, a marine who's addicted to, or who was at the time addicted to bath salts.

Speaker 1:          00:49:37       We should explain to people that these are not actually bath salts to people that live happy lives here. It's drugs stay off the internet. Right. The term bath salts as a term given to these synthetic drugs that escape regulation because they're not clinically, they're not technically legal or illegal. Illegal. Yeah. Undefined. Well they're defined and they sell them and sell them as bath salts and says not for human consumption warrant warrant. Right, right. Exactly. Yeah. So

Speaker 3:          00:50:07       there are chemical, they're made in labs, but they have the same sort of effects on your body as a cocaine or math, but it's made in labs so there's nothing natural about it is entirely made with chemicals, most of which come from China and India and you can order them and then you have a garage and they're the kids. This is how it started off with these kids putting all these chemicals together. You have it all the internet step by step on how to make it pretty easy. And you make these batches of both what they call bath salts and the initially call them bath salts so that they could sell them with a not for human consumption. We went blank, although they're super expensive compared to regular bath salts and you, and they may be a spice and k two and these were drugs that were sold over the counter smoke shops. I mean we were able to buy them at shell stations, gas stations, and they're sold all over the country. And it's really hard to go after these drugs because as soon as the government comes out and prohibits one compound, they immediately, you know, China and India is already have already all these other chemicals ready to ship. Um, so they just need to change a little compounds and it's a new drug and it's legal all of a sudden. So that's why it's so hard to get.

Speaker 4:          00:51:11       It's, it's amazing that that sort of popped up out of nowhere. It's like all of a sudden someone figured out, oh, we could do this. Yeah. Well, I think they would like, they were sitting around in like chemistry labs at universities, like, you know, they were doing legitimate research on them. And then this sort of, you know, monkey got out of the cage and next thing you know, it's, uh, you know, running ramp at 28 days later.

Speaker 3:          00:51:33       Really interesting. It was a professor at a university in, do you remember what the name of the university was? A Michigan, maybe, I can't remember, but it was a professor in the 70s it was doing this research. You wanted to know what kind of effects drugs have on a person's brain. So he was doing all this research and came out with all these compounds and all this came out. And suddenly it was, you know, tha tha tha tha tha tha instructions and the manual on how to create these crazy drugs that are now everywhere around us and legal.

Speaker 4:          00:52:06       Yeah. But, but you know, John McAfee, McAfee, McAfee, McAfee, I never know how to say that. It always pops up on your computer and you're like McAfee graded that, right? No, he didn't create basketball, McAfee viral software. So He's, he's a legitimate, the smart guy. Why is it one point in time? Yeah, it might be a little crazy, but like most of these bath salts and synthetic marijuana of being put together by like some Yahoo who's in the garage. So that's where the problem comes in is that, you know, you don't know what you're getting and you don't know how if they're mixing it correctly, they do these things. You get these things called hotspots, like where at one portion of the batch we'll have like 30 times the amount of the product compared to another part that might just have just been missing, you know, so, so you never know what you're getting. And obviously, you know, when you have like a 1920 year old kid who's just looking to make some money and mixing it together, he's not probably doing the best science to, uh, yeah. Yeah. And you're also, there's a bunch of different effects of these things, right? It's another night. It's not uniform.

Speaker 3:          00:53:05       Yeah, we did. We spoke about the over aggressiveness. People believe that they have superhuman force. Uh, there's all these videos that you can search it on youtube to have people going out and believing their superman and throwing themselves off cliffs. We spoke to a doctor who had treated a patient who was a lawyer. He was studying for the bar and took some of this stuff and decided that his hands, his own hands, we're trying to attack him. He thought paranoid. He thought his hands were trying to attack him. So he put both his hands on a stove top and burned his old art heart arms and he couldn't feel the pain. So it was just because the neighbor smelt the burning of his arms that they came.

Speaker 1:          00:53:43       So he was cooking his own arms. Just sitting is on arms. Yeah. So some of these drugs are related to, um, other drugs where they like take it and they change a molecule or twist something around. But they're, they're not, it's not uniform. So it's not like they're all derivatives of this. They're there. They very like wildly.

Speaker 3:          00:54:06       So you buy a batch of sexy Zombie today and do you snort it or smoke it and it does something to you really like it's a really great high, it wasn't too bad. Next day there's not much of a hangover. So the next day you decided you want to go to the smoke shop and buy some more of this stuff. But that batch can be, have the same name, same name, possibly come from the same place, but it's entirely different. You never know. Every single batch is different. So suddenly you might be taken to the hospital or you might be out trying to attack somebody.

Speaker 1:          00:54:34       And there's also that story in Florida, that guy that ate that guy's face that's felt on the map. That story. Yeah. Well what's interesting is they said, well it's been, you know, it's been refuted because he didn't test positive for bath salts. But then I read there is no test for bass salts. Like he didn't test positive and passwords cause it doesn't exist. You don't, first of all, they don't know what to look for. Right. Because it could be any, a number one of these different substances and second of all, they're not looking.

Speaker 3:          00:54:58       Exactly. And that's why they're so popular in that we heard that they're so popular in places where there's drug testing is, is a mandatory searches military or we have communities or even bull fighting. We were in Arizona and interview both people from the bull fighting community. And this is really popular there because it's so hard to test these drugs so they can do that. Just take them and know that nobody's going to ever find out.

Speaker 1:          00:55:20       So they take these bass sauce and then hop on a ball. Yeah. Holy Shit Jacqueline. Yeah. We spoke to a kid to do that reckless person go. It takes bath salts and gets it. I'll pull. Wow. So it's very possible apparently that that guy who he, that guy's face was, was on pass halls as possible. And that sounds right. Right. Doesn't it?

Speaker 4:          00:55:41       It's uh, I guess, yeah, it's consistent with behavior. That's nice. Very scientific words. Yeah. I mean we can't, I have no idea if the guy was on bath salts. It definitely, you know, I think the cops were like, this is the craziest thing you've ever seen. And it, it's just consistent with behavior that we've seen of other people that have been on bath salts. That's why that jumped to the conclusion that maybe it was bath salts and even after the autopsy or whatever they did, you know, they, uh, they said they ruled out that what that, I don't know if they rolled it out, but they said that it probably wasn't bath salts or something, but who knows

Speaker 1:          00:56:12       how long before the pharmaceutical companies realize how much money's in bath salts and just say, listen, we need to do is just set up some labs and like Mexico or Peru or whatever, turn out our own bath salts, launch them over the border with catapults, have people pick them up on trucks.

Speaker 5:          00:56:28       Yeah. Well there's an article that came out today actually about how the DEA had just busted and is really concerned about synthetic drugs because it is becoming quite a big problem here in the United States. And how they finding out that actually it is, uh, they, they said that it was their finding some connections of how it's funding terrorism in the Middle East. It's funny how everything ends up. Funding terrorism in the Middle East. It just means we need to spend more money on tanks. That's the tank companies, you know. But there are some really sad stories that we, you know, we interviewed the father of a kid who took baths, holes for the first time because a friend gave it to him and the kids went totally wild. Came into his parents house and slit his throat in front of his parents and uh, died five days later. Oh. So yeah, it's definitely something to,

Speaker 1:          00:57:14       well, when you have children, that's when drugs really start worrying you. Like drugs never worried me when I was single because I was like, you know, I'm not doing anything stupid. I'm not worried about it. I would hear stories about people dying and you know, it would make me sad, but it didn't, it didn't hit home. Boy started having children. And you think about all the dumb things that you did growing up and somehow or another dodge, all those bullets and got to be an adult and you think about these little ones growing up in this new world where it's not so easy because when I was a kid, there was no such thing as oxycontin. There was no such thing as pain management centers. There's no such thing as 240,000 people in a year getting a prescription for oxygen in Montana. There was none of those things.

Speaker 1:          00:57:52       So those hurdles, even though it was still, there's lots of scary stuff that that wasn't there, but I got really fortunate that I saw my friends when I was a kid. My friend's cousin was a coke dealer and they go, I got to watch him right away. I mean, I got to watch his life like fall apart over the course of a year. Like I lost all this weight became creepy. He was hiding all the time. Just became like a vampire. Like he got bitten by a vampire and became this like sick person was really, he was a dealer. Yes, he was a dealer, an addict himself who's doing it himself. And in watching that and watching them go from like a regular guy to becoming this guy, it was a huge lesson to be learned. And um, I was in Vegas this weekend and I heard, I was talking to this guy who was a, the the driver and I said, uh, you know how you like living in Vegas?

Speaker 1:          00:58:38       Is it, is it problem? He goes, well, he goes, you know, the thing is a, it's the drugs man. You gotta avoid the drugs if you can avoid the drugs. It's a, it's a good place to live. Like it's like most people just avoid the strip. But fortunately for me, my sister was hooked on drugs and southern person was hooked on drugs. He's telling me all the people he knew that are hooked on drugs, you know, that had sort of, he learned from them to not do it. It's like, it's almost like how we need to learn. You need to learn by watching other people fucking okay. Yup. You are going to leave the belief that government, if the government comes out and tells you to avoid it, you're like, whatever. Fuck you crux now you know, it's w what can be done to like besides, you know, you talking, are you doing a show like that? Did you guys or is there anybody you talked to that had some really concrete plans or how this could be hard

Speaker 5:          00:59:25       now there's some great organizations out there, support group or organizations. You know, again, a lot of them are being led by women, by mothers, which I think is phenomenal and they are really trying to raise awareness and pass legislation to make these, these, these bills are harder to get into to stop these, these, you know, crazy doctors from over prescribing. Um, but it's, you know, um, the, there, there is a way and I, I do love the, whenever I speak to some of these mothers, it's really refreshing to see these, these are just women who are so strong and wanting to fight for this.

Speaker 1:          01:00:01       Yeah, well that, that is a nice thing, but it just sucks that they have to fight for that. Jamie, there's something going on with it. It's buffering every few minutes. People complain a lot. Yeah. So you stream side. Yeah, yeah. Sorry. We got a hundred megabytes a second upload ladies and gentlemen now. So it's all Ustream, those dirty bitches. You gotta figure it out, complained to use trim. We can't help you. Um, the, uh, the, uh, the show, you're going to basically, you're, you're going after a lot of different things. It's not, not just drugs. When you, when you do this kind of investigative journalism and you're like ruffle feathers and sort of, uh, make noise. Did you guys experience any blowback from that?

Speaker 4:          01:00:36       Um, occasionally, but then, you know, like this series as we did in the Ashcan p said that we started with, um, you know, we did some on a lot of, on the cover of filming and uh, you know, our sort of approach to that is that we're not looking to get any individual in trouble when I try to do any Gotcha. Kind of journalism and busts any individual. We're just trying to shed light on an issue. And so I think, you know, if we were targeting a specific individual, um, you know, there might be a little bit of blowback, um, whether rightly or wrongly, whether we were doing it that way. But I think, you know, the fact that we were just trying to shed light on an issue and the only way that we can do that is with on the cover of cameras. You, you sort of, uh, you know, mute the blow back a little bit because it's just enlightening for most people to see what goes on when people don't know the camera's rolling, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:01:22       Yeah. That's a, that's probably a very good point. Yeah, I didn't think of that. That's um, uh, that, that's probably what saved you guys.

Speaker 5:          01:01:31       Well, Mike, well, Mike Wallace. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:01:33       From 60 minutes, 60 minutes pioneered the undercover camera. Then they, they started doing away with it and Mike Wallace said, you know, uh, the idea was to, to draw light, but we started drawing heat. And so once you know, it just becomes a bit of a, you know, during heat and not shedding enough light, then, you know, it's not time. It's time to sort of

Speaker 5:          01:01:49       stopped doing it. So yeah, I think that will be our, or it's time to stop as well. But I do get nervous every time. I know, you know, I just rewatched for the 10th time, the doctor, the first episode of this series that is airing on Wednesday night at 10:00 PM and I'm in a, made me really nervous just to watch some of the stuff cause we did go undercover and filmed a lot of things, films, a lot of people selling drugs and some people taking drugs and um, a lot of it was filmed undercover and makes me nervous for sure. But it's, it an issue that we thought

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       was, you know, an important issue, not enough people know about it. And what other subjects you guys cover? We have, the second one is about guns. Um, and we go into, we go to Arizona. We spent a lot of time in Arizona, uh, and we basically became the, the, we transformed ourselves into the bad guys, into criminals trying to get guns just to see how easy it would be for a criminal to get their hands on guns in Arizona. And in the space of about two, three days, we were able to get three handguns, uh, one of which is the most powerful handgun, a Smith and Wesson 500 magnum. I know. I now I'm an expert on guns. I knew nothing about guns before this and we were able to get an AK 47 and a 50 cow caliber, which is know most powerful names in the world. Um, out of, um, the, the, the AK 47 we got out of the Taco bell parking lot. We went online, um, backpage.com re looked for AK 47 and within 45 minutes we had bought an AK 47 out of those guys.

Speaker 1:          01:03:21       Is this car as well? Oh my God. We were on a budget so we can, so this person, when you ere the, showed you blocked her face,

Speaker 3:          01:03:29       black, their faces out. Because who knows why they're doing this and that case, they actually looked like drunk drug addict. So it was really important for us to not, again, not knowing, going after anyone personally.

Speaker 1:          01:03:38       Yeah. Beautiful of you. And congratulations on handling it that way. Cause that's a, I think the the right way to do it. And it's also obviously this person as a part of a much greater issue in to turn it on to make it about one person. It's like, it's a tendency to do in this country I to victimize or to criminalize this one person or whatever, you know, focus on one person when really what's going on is the issue, right? Being able to buy cons that easy.

Speaker 3:          01:04:06       Do you know what's so interesting though is that right after we bought that AK 47, it was, I think it was, uh, it was a first assault rifle that we bought in Arizona and uh, we'd been nervous whether, you know, we'd invested money to go there and we'd going to be able to, to buy these guns. And so to sort of celebrate our purchase, we went into the, uh, bar right next to Taco bell and we order three beers. Myself, Darren and the other producer, Alex. And, uh, because Alex didn't have his id with him, they didn't sell him a beer. Meanwhile, we just bought a naked 47 outside and no, no one asked for id or even our names.

Speaker 1:          01:04:38       That's funny. It keeps cutting out. Jamie. Maybe we should switch it over to a lower stream or something like that. Try that. Try that. See if that helps. We'll fix it for you folks, folks. Um, the, uh, the, the gun issue is a really a, a creepy one in this country and it's also in my opinion, connected to the pharmaceutical issue. And the reason being is that there's this massive connection between the things that people are afraid of when it comes to guns, which is school shootings and the in the, like a massive connection between those and the use of Ssri and antidepressants. And there's something like, I think the latest statistic was it was more than 90% of all school shooters, uh, either are on antidepressants when they do it or are recovering from antidepressants when they do it. And that's one of those things that makes you wonder like, which came first, the chicken or the egg, right. Yeah. You know? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:05:35       no, definitely. I'm in like a, I think when you talk about those mass units, and actually we shot this and the last day of, of, um, of shooting was, um, the aurora shooting less Dave filming. Oh Wow. Uh, the gun space was the, the Aurora shooting. That's incredible. Yeah. And then, you know, so it's been in the camp for awhile, this piece. And then, you know, when Newtown happened, you know, there was some question of whether we should air the show, uh, the, the, the guns episode early. But, um, we decided, you know, there was enough debate going on at that point. It just to hold it off. Um, yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:06:07       And then he used the guide, the aura, the, um, the new town, um, sandy hook shooting. He used a bushmaster, which we also saw for sale at gun shows. What is that 10 or 15? I've thought the Sandy Hook. I used pistols. I think that sandy hook guy used the Ed Bushmaster. Yeah. Hmm. I just look it up. I'm pretty sure.

Speaker 1:          01:06:30       Or the, the new findings or the sandy hook shooting was that he actually didn't use assault weapon pistols. Hold on.

Speaker 6:          01:06:42       I'm saying we should know

Speaker 1:          01:06:44       NBC admitted no assault rifle used in new town shooting.

Speaker 6:          01:06:49       Um, do,

Speaker 1:          01:06:51       do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do too. Um, for hand guns. Apparently only handguns were taking into the school. Yeah, I think, um, yeah, he had, it had been said that he had, oh, he had an ar 15 assault rifle that he taken into the school. Um, and it was in the car that he drove there, but they've been told by several officials that he had left it in the car and then he came in and just shut everyone pistols.

Speaker 5:          01:07:22       I remember when the reports came out hearing about the bushmaster that he had to bushmaster. And I remember clearly having seen it and the gun shows and we, you know, we almost bought one.

Speaker 1:          01:07:32       I mean we're really beach spin. This is just sort of a technicality here. But what kind of gun he used, um, the obviously shot a bunch of people. That's what's important is it someone can get this tool and really that's what it is and inanimate tool and a person can get it and go do these things. And these things happen very rarely. And when they happen, there's this massive reaction and the reaction is almost always to try to take guns away. And that's what gets like the real nutters. Crazy, right? I ain't going to take my cold dead fingers. Romaco and it's, um, it's, it's almost like it's one the strangest debates in our culture because it's not a gun. It's killing all these people. It's, it's a person who's doing something that is horrific and impossible. Stop. It's, it's, it's a person that's doing something.

Speaker 1:          01:08:31       So if, if, if they didn't have a gun, who knows what they would do? I mean, would they try to do it with a car where they just plow over a bunch of people in the road? Would they, would they make a bomb? The idea is that this tool makes it easier for them to do it, but the reality is the gun's not doing shit on its own. And the real issue in my mind is always been a person able to do something like that. Like how does that happen and why is that sort of brushed away? Everyone just wants to talk about gun control and then it gets up this debate and humans are so wacky that when there's a debate, there's two sides screaming at each other and nothing gets done. You know, you have the Ted Nugent side, that stockpile and ammo because they think Obama's to, uh, you know, turn the whole country into communist Russia.

Speaker 1:          01:09:17       And then, you know, you've got the other side that want the, you know, that say, fuck hunters, you should just kill hunters. No one should have a gun, you know, get your meat from a supermarket. This is bullshit. We need to, we need to evolve. You know, there's, there's that, that argument as well and my opinion, it's a mental health issue. And uh, just the fact that guns exist, like guns are crazy. The idea that you could just point at something and make it disappear, but there's so many guns, there's so many gun owners and it's so rare if you look at it statistically that something like this happens. If you look at how many human beings we have in this country, it's like 300 million and how many shootings like this happen where someone indiscriminately just starts whacking people around them. It's kind of strange that it's so rare because there's so many fucking nuts. Yeah. So many fucking crazy people in this country. It's almost, we're like blessed that these things don't happen on a regular basis. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:10:10       Well in many ways I think the gun debate is an easier debate to have if it's the same with addiction, right? I mean like addictions, very complicated issue. Mental health is a very complicated issue and you know, it's not as easy as to talk about. Do you want guns or do you want that one Collins? And I think you know what, not to have guns. And I think what we were trying to show in an RPA says that like the same laws that make it easy for anybody to access guns also makes it easy for people who you don't want to having guns and have guns. And so if you're comfortable with that, and then there were many states and there are many people that are comfortable with that, that that's, that's great. And uh, if you know, if you're not, if you, if you fear the damage that had gun can do, um, in a, in the wrong person's hand, then you know, that's also a worthy thing to debate. I think it's a much easier debate. I agree with you. It's much more black and white. It's about having the right to bear arm to have arms and what should be the limits on that. And then, and then pills, which actually, you know, um, it's a much more of a gray area debate.

Speaker 1:          01:11:11       Yeah, it certainly is. Um, and

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       even if there is gun laws, I guess you could punish people harder for selling you an AK 47 and a parking lot. But the fact that you could just do it. Yeah, that's a, the anybody wants to stop background checks from owning guns is an asshole. It's really that simple. Yeah. I mean I think it's, there is the vast majority of people just agree on most things and then it's, you know, the sort of extremes of both sides that sort of hindsight to debate and you know, background checks. You know, we go through background checks anytime we want to buy a car or you know, like you know, and they ask for id if you want to write it. So why not ask for your id or to get the background check if you want to buy a dangerous weapon. I saw the best Twitter post on this.

Speaker 4:          01:12:02       Somebody wrote this is the way to solve the gun problems. Take everybody who has a gun and killed him. And I was like, Jesus Christ. See that is talking about missing the point. That doesn't help the debate. But it was just one of those things that like this extreme reaction that people have to, to the, to the gun issue when the reality is, and you know, and I'm not in the Ted Nugent camp, but the reality is when you look at the actual numbers of people with guns and the small amount of times of these things happen, it's really not a gun issue. It's a mental health issue. But there's the sort of pedestrian violence that happens every day. Sure. There's rare mass shootings and stuff like that, but every day, you know, either accidentally or on purpose, people are getting shot with guns and killed. You know, it's true.

Speaker 4:          01:12:52       And you know, the thing is, is that, uh, the, the part that I loved about doing the piece and was when we started out as we went to, uh, this, um, shooting range and we with Po took part in this festival, um, independent state rifle match. Yeah. Um, and you know, there were guys that are very obviously very pro gun on and like with disagree with anybody who says that they should be any limits on gun ownership or anything like that. But at same time, you know, a lot of the guys who we're speaking to, we're very serious about the safety that went into to, you know, what, owning a gun. There's a responsibility there that if you own something, just like if you own or drive a car, there's a responsibility to know how to drive a car and had, you know, to, to educate yourself.

Speaker 4:          01:13:30       And so, you know, the NRA, um, they often, they offer these pistol classes and they teach you how to, you know, on load load and how to do everything safely. And you know, I think it's not mandatory for gun owners, but I think anybody that wants to own a gun should certainly take a class in how to handle, handle, handle a weapon because they're super dangerous. Yeah. I don't think there's any debate in that whatsoever. And I think another issue that needs to be taken into consideration is how many people's lives are saved with guns from bad guys. I mean, how many, um, how many times have a police in, in, in justifiable cases shot people. I mean, when you look at the number of people that shot in this country, sometimes it's people that are protecting their home from a, a burglar and sometimes

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       it's a woman trying to prevent a rape. I mean, all these things are true as well. So it isn't a black and white issue. And that's what gets people really weird. And you know, by the way, if you really, if you really adamant about gun control and you've really adamant about stopping gun violence, pay attention to the fact that we're involved in wars too. Crazy ones. And they're in places that don't make any sense and people are dying over there. Just, yeah, a lot of innocent people. And you know, how about drones, you know, there's a lot of other shit going on. It's not just happening right here. It's a violence issue. It's a attachment from humanity issue. It's, it's a very strange one. It's one that seems to be lingering in, uh, in our transition from this, you know, primal, Alpha male monkey thing that we used to be to whatever we're becoming.

Speaker 1:          01:15:00       As we become more and more educated and more and more aware of the consequences of our actions and more and more hopefully enlightened. Where were we? We're still, we still have this thing where you could just press a button and people explode, you know? And anybody can get one in the parking lot after being online in 45 minutes, which sounds strange. I mean, people are so God damn strange, and you really look at it that way. If you were an objective observer, you know, from another planet that sent here to report back on earth, boy, what a fucking story you would have. You'd have to sit them down and you'd have to go, okay, well this was not what we had hoped for. And we just say that first. They're fucking crazy. First of all, they're all on pills.

Speaker 1:          01:15:47       They got guns, they're on pills. No one knows what the fuck they're doing. It's all bananas. Yeah. Journalists are driving into trees or 90 miles an hour, not leaving skid marks. When you guys saw that, did you get scared? Like thinking about the business that you're in? We're talking about Michael Hastings who a a journalists for the rolling stone magazine and he was involved in exactly what you're not involved in and he was involved in singling out individuals and going after them and he did did it to a very powerful general and wrote some piece in rolling stone. They got the guy fired and repeatedly told people that people had told them they're going to kill him. Then one day his car going 100 miles an hour, uh, in Hollywood, slammed directly into a pole or a tree and killed them, burst into flames, no skid marks at all. And you know, you think, well that's a, that's crazy. Then this guy who was, uh, involved in security for President Clinton and Bush said that you can hack into a car now and that today it's possible to hack into a modern car and control the steering, control, the acceleration and patrol the brakes. And then it's very possible you could remote control a car and make someone accelerate and slam into a tree, make the car explode. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:17:13       Uh, so when I'm starting to go where the story, yeah. I mean I've heard the just, um, and some of the conspiracies that's around this, I don't really know the details, but um, I will say that he was, he was a great reporter and uh, definitely, um, yeah, big loss for the industry for sure. That's a good way to play it safe.

Speaker 1:          01:17:33       No, no, I don't. I really don't. I applaud you on your, so basically tell us what you think. Oh, I don't know. I have no idea. I think it would be foolish of me with my zero understanding of the mechanics of modern automobiles, zero understanding of the computer equipment that runs them. I have zero technical knowledge, Richard Clark. So it was, yeah, it was a several others as well who have studied the, the mechanisms behind, uh, the possibilities of remote controlling various things, hacking into them, you know, um, I don't know on our own what's true. I have no idea, but it's scary, scary scenario. It's very scary. Yeah. I mean it's trying to have a moving. We've got just drives it. He's, he's about to release this crazy story, tells everyone that the FBI is looking into them and interviewing all of his friends and then, and do a tray boom and the car explodes and he dies and no story.

Speaker 1:          01:18:28       It's just kind of slowly disappear. You know, Kim Cardiac, she won't get pregnant from some other dudes and like a couple of months and Kanye West would be on the outs and everybody, I forget about Michael Hastings, you know, a few people try to talk about it on the line and uh, other Fox called, Oh God, he's still talking about Michael Hanes things. Laennec oh, pulleys. No, he's talking about the great work that it definitely did. Yes. Yeah. Um, but you know, I think also a thing to take into consideration and said we live in an age of extreme transparency and anybody who does something that evil, it's seems like it's almost impossible to completely cover things up. And if it's not impossible now I feel like it will be in a few years. I feel like any sort of record of something of that magnitude. Yes. If this is going to be a way that that's going to come to light and some sort of a wikileaks type scenario, you're an optimist.

Speaker 1:          01:19:23       I'm an optimist. I May, I would, I would call a technological optimist. You know, there's that famous Orson Welles CHRO that history is a race between, um, between education and catastrophe. And uh, I think if you look at the trends, education seems to like kind of always be winning. And I think part of that it's that ultimately what's good for the entire race triumphs over what's good for the few. And I think even what's good for the few in terms of a band for the entire race is bad for the few because I think there's a thing called Karma. And I think that's real. And I think that the effect that you have on your environment is a very tangible thing. The way people react to you is a very physical, real measurable thing. And that comes from being a piece of shit. If you're a piece of shit, you do horrible things.

Speaker 1:          01:20:14       It's very difficult to feel warm and fuzzy and joy, love and happiness and have friends. And I think that, uh, ultimately technology most likely will be the tool that balances all that out. Because I think that with technology comes as transparency. And with this transparency, you get to see the actions of these few, um, in a different light. Then we got to see like, whether it was in the 60s and the seventies or when Eisenhower warned of the, when he left office and he was warning about the military industrial complex. That was just of a film that was on television for one brief moment in a time where there was no VCRs. So it's like, how much impact is that even going to have? Then we'll, whereas now, many, many years later, over half a century later, that film's being played over and over again on the Internet as an example of how this is probably an issue that's been around secretly behind the curtain for a long time, but now every day there's some new thing.

Speaker 1:          01:21:15       Every day there's some new piece of information. Every day there's some new story, you know, but there it's Edward Snowden or whether it's, you know, someone else releasing something else or it's some people getting arrested for something that you can't believe is real. That's, that's almost impossible. But cover that stuff up these days. Yeah, no, it's crazy. Yeah. I like that idea that if she, people say I'm ridiculous, you could easily say I'm ridiculous. First of all, I'm not qualified to give any prognostication whatsoever. I'm to camp, give a prognosis. I mean, this is just a gut reaction, but I think that if you look at the way life used to be a thousand years ago and the way life is today, you know, try living in during the inquisition, try living in the Middle Ages shows, always hear people, oh we're, we're living in the most violent time and it's not actually the least violent time in history.

Speaker 1:          01:22:07       And we actually have it pretty good. But yeah, but I'm a strong believer in Karma as well. I think we're dealing with a time where we're really confused. There's obviously some bad spots everywhere and there always have been. It's very difficult to be a human being and it's very difficult to develop a human being, to raise a person. So to have a baby become an adult, the processes insane. There's so many pitfalls and nobody gives you a guidebook. Nobody knows what the fuck we're doing. And we're getting information from 7 million or 7 billion rather people a day. Essentially. We're getting, not all the information, but anything crazy, anything fucked up. You know, Nan born with 10 penis is there he is, you know, like that'll get through. Yeah. That gets through everything crazy gets through and it's almost like we weren't, we were designed for that were designed for what's happening in the tribe.

Speaker 1:          01:22:54       Who are those guys with swords coming over the hill. Hey, we gotta get the Fuck Outta here. You know, that's what we're sort of designed for. We're dealing with the same genetics essentially that people had 10,000 years ago and there was no communication back then. There was nothing. And now it's on your phone. I was at a restaurant the other day with a buddy of mine and I'm like, I'm a fucking junkie. I can't put this goddamn phone down. I have to keep checking the stupid phone. Um, so I such an asshole, like I can't see what's going on on Twitter. You know, it's so bad, but it's this, what's happening is I keep getting information and I'll go and I'll see something and Ooh, and maybe I'll see nothing and then I'll look more and they'll see nothing. I'll look more than, Ooh, a new post by someone I follow. Something crazy is happening, especially when it's a married couple and we were wearing the same sort of business and we're, you know, always when it journalists over all, he's looking for information. But I find that where it's almost like a ping pong ball four as well.

Speaker 4:          01:23:45       I'm looking at the phone and he's really mad at me cause we're having dinner and I'm looking at the phone and then I put it down and then he's looking at the front, keep the romance alive and she's checking her phone.

Speaker 1:          01:23:58       I was at a restaurant the other day and I watched four people and none of them talked and they all stay on their phone the entire time they're sitting there eating together.

Speaker 4:          01:24:05       Yeah. But then you look at it and be like, oh, at least people. And then five minutes later you're the one checking your phone and then we're looking to do so at the same thing. So it's like, yeah, we are junkies really are. I interviewed Ray Kurzweil

Speaker 1:          01:24:17       for, uh, my, I have a new show is coming out on by thank you. And one of the episodes were talking about the, the convergence, the human to machine convergence and then the idea that one day we will be some sort of a combination of people and technology and he was essentially making the argument that it's already happened and that it's just we were slowly accepting it, but that technology is in pacemakers and in hearing aids and we are so attached to our phones that it could be argued that if you have a certain number of people that constantly carry phones with them, their argument could be that you're already a part of that. Like what? You just haven't figured out a way to put it in your body. So the way before they had hearing aids, those dudes used to carry those horns. They bought lean forward. You remember those? Like you'd see them in the old like three stooges movies and shit and he's like a giant Buffalo Horn. What? I would get close to you.

Speaker 4:          01:25:10       Well, not Google glass and now you don't even have to hold anything. Have you, have you played with Diana? I haven't. Have you?

Speaker 1:          01:25:16       Yes. Yeah, I got a chance. I have a friend who works at Google and she let me, uh, that's one of those things, yeah. That the, these to look like that would help you. Um, he, she let me play with it. It's, it's a very, very interesting, and it, it, it feels to me like, uh, a step like, like, Ooh, I'm holding onto a model t right here. Like, this is, this is what's one day going to be a Tesla? You know, one day it's going to be a contact lens and we're all going to have one or it'll be some sort of an implant. So describe it to me. Well, it's sort of crude because, uh, sorry, Google, but right now, uh, it has to be tethered to a phone. Um, and this is, uh, I played with, uh, it's not ready for prime time prototype.

Speaker 1:          01:25:57       It's a prototype and, uh, a Google fallen at that and, um, you do things to it. Like you can ask for. Um, one of the things I thought it was cool. It was like you could Google like a ray Kurzweil, you know, Google Ray Kurzweil and, and all of a sudden it shows you like a, a page like right out of Google on Ray Kurzweil and you can like see like Google Gray Kurzweil video and it shows you all these video options and then you could play them off of youtube, but it's like projected somewhere. Are you looking at the glass? Yes, there it is. That's me with one of those things that you can see it over there to miss this TV in front of you actually at this one. No worries. Um, yeah. Um, you see it sort of floating in space, but nobody can see it. Like if I have it on and I'm talking to you, you can't see what I'm saying.

Speaker 1:          01:26:46       I see it. But you can't see it. And it's one of those things where if you like, look over here, you don't see it, but you look here, you see it Israeli trippy. It's strange. But the strangest aspect is that I felt like I was holding onto something that was going to be something way greater someday. And this is just the first steps of this weird sort of a transformation and to the uh, the, the symbiotic. So while right, it's freaky not, not sure if I'm looking forward to it and I have to say, I feel like I am cause I feel like, um, I enjoy so many aspects of technology already. I think people are afraid for the most, we're afraid of a loss of privacy. But if we could get people to stop being assholes, if everybody was like freely cool, would you care if everybody looked at your pictures and got into email?

Speaker 1:          01:27:32       We know that everybody is, that people are looking at everything we do, but our issue is not with people looking at our stuff. Our issues are with assholes looking at our stuff or people using our information against us. That's what we're really concerned with. And I wonder if you could extrapolate the sort of the, this, this, this, this thing that we're going through with technology where this is massive curve and it's spinning and spinning faster and faster until you're this exponential growth. If it was possible to somehow another encouraged that and human behavior as well as with technology. If technology could be used by in, in, in aiding in this sort of like connection with people in aiding, in emphasizing empathy and emphasizing a comradery and friendship and love, if that could be like seen as like a more worthwhile ethic and more worthwhile, like a state of consciousness and behavior.

Speaker 1:          01:28:31       It sounds like very hippie now you're really optimistic. I think it's possible. I really do think that there's repercussions that people experience now when they do something terrible to someone on like on the Internet where there's this flood of Red Rock, we'll go after them now that no one ever had before. You know, like did you ever see there was a video where anonymous, uh, released this video of this girl who was throwing puppies into a river and then they went after, exposed her and chase her and it was really horrific. But this, this, this, the, the people swarmed on this evil behavior. They saw that someone was doing something terrible and they went after it. And this one example is also the example of the, uh, the, what happened in Ohio with a, the rapes were they were, they were trying to cover it up and that was also exposed by hackers and then the massive amount of negative attention that was given on those people.

Speaker 1:          01:29:26       And it's like in time, would that not slowly sort of like cure people of this, this sort of behavior or if not cure people, make it far less likely to happen? Yeah. The golden rule becomes a, because people know what the fuck's going on and they're not going to tolerate it. If everyone knows it's something like that happened. Someone did a horrible thing, wouldn't that lessen the occurrences of these things? If there were repercussions, the masses had access. The problem is of course, that we don't think we don't think of that loss of privacy in that way. We think of a loss of privacy and big brother. We think of like the NSA's is listening to all your phone calls and copying all your emails and you know, it sounds very, are well in and dangerous and scary, you know, and that this is a, an erosion of privacy, but it's also, it seems inevitable.

Speaker 1:          01:30:20       It seems inevitable. And if it's not inevitable in the sense that the government gets it, I think they just going to get, they might get ahold of it first, but it seems like it's, everybody's going to get it right. Like it's just, that's where it's going. It's all moving to this area of no boundaries. It's very weird. But if you look at how life has changed since the Internet, you know, and when did we get it? Like 90 Ish, 94 ish when it really took hold. I got an AOL, I think it was in 94 I was on your side adopter. Yeah. Well, uh, I owe it to my friend Robbie. Robbie was a computer major. Robbie Printz, what's up dude? He was a computer major in college and then became a standup comedian and was telling me like, oh, it's a great way to write your jokes.

Speaker 1:          01:31:01       I can have a fucking, I didn't know how to type it all out, but I remember getting online the first day, uh, on AOL and they have like all these categories you can look into. And I was fascinated. I was like, this is the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life. If you have a question, and it was so rudimentary and crewed with a 14, four baud modem, but extrapolate that from 1994 take, take 1994 and go and look at how we are now in 2013 I would have never guessed, first of all, I'd never guessed that I'd be sitting in some room talking to some people who made a documentary that I said. And the only way we communicated until today was strictly through this electronic medium. No publicists, no nothing, no one hooking this up. And no, like no formal process. And then now, no producers, no network, no nothing, no filtration, no censorship instantaneously broadcast.

Speaker 1:          01:31:58       And My, my Ustream page as right now it's 14 million views. Yeah. So it's, it's reaches a lot of people. It's not like, it's not like a couple of Weirdos are checking it out and then it goes on iTunes and it at least a half a million. We'll download each individual episode from the, either that or stitcher or just the raw MP3. Like this is a crazy shift in the way things were done just 20 years from now. And then you think about Facebook, you think about Twitter, you can take a picture of something, you put it online and then this guy retweets it and that guy retweets it. And if it's something, especially if it's something big or a story big, it could get retweeted by millions. And then before you know it, it becomes a new story. And then before you know it, it becomes something that the whole country knows about and it's almost instantaneous. I look at that and I say, how is it possible that that's not going to continue to go in that same direction and I really do think it's going to be beneficial. I think there's going to be pitfalls for sure as we sort of figure out are weighed and how to navigate this new world that we live in. You know? Pardon the phrase, but I ultimately think that it's going to be beneficial.

Speaker 5:          01:33:02       I am

Speaker 1:          01:33:03       sold. I think it's going to no dairy technology here. No, I am too. It's just that it's going to make our romantic dinners even harder. Yeah, because you'd be like, are you looking at me? Are you looking at your Google contact lens? Right, right. Exactly. You son of a bitch, look into my, I'm not sure what we'll have to, the thing is about these things. They seem to want to operate on voice recognition. It seems to be that's what the trend is where these things that'd be very difficult to hide. Yeah. You know, you can't say, oh listen honey, I totally did Google, blah, blah, blah. I totally agree with you. Google new shoes. I don't know, I guess, I mean, it'd be nice if we all took our Google contact lenses off as we, uh, entered in exactly. Men To town. Yeah. It's, I guess it's, it's, it's just an inevitability of the world we live in and we just have to accept the fact that the times they are changing for the better. Hopefully I think maybe I'm wrong. I'm fucking wrong. Don't listen to me. What are some of the discussions you guys cover?

Speaker 5:          01:34:07       Uh, the third episode is sex trafficking actually. Oh, that was really interesting one. Yes. So, um, it is, you know, you think about tex trafficking, you think of foreign women being drawn into the United States. Well, it's 10 times more likely that an American is being trafficked than it is a foreigner in another country right here in American here in the United States. Yes. And American here in the US. So we basically went undercover. I went undercover as a prostitute trying to get a job at a massage parlor in Houston. And I mean within five minutes I was approached by this guy who tried to get me to be a prostitute for him. He wanted to be, do you want it to be my pimp? And uh, meanwhile Darren was filming all of this from across the street in the car.

Speaker 1:          01:34:48       Oh my God. I know you're not freaking out. Well you must be freaking out a little bit. He was. And because, you know, technology

Speaker 5:          01:34:55       has evolved so much, but we, we don't, we didn't have all the technology we it with us at the time. We just had our iPhone, I had my iPhone on mute but on speakerphone so he could hear what was happening. And then I had the little glasses, secret filming glasses and, but the only way he could hear me was through my speaker phone, iPhone. And um, the whole time I was holding the iPhone while talking to this guy. So it looked really strange cause I was trying to get Darren to hear what was happening and the guys saying, you know, you're, where are you from? You look like you're from Sweden, don't you? You, you can get a lot of clients. I can make you thousands of dollars every night and you look so clean, which is a compliment that I've never gotten before. You look really clean when you wonder why you're a clean, clean girl.

Speaker 5:          01:35:43       Meanwhile, and he kept on insisting for me to go into the car with him and Darren across the street couldn't see where I was at and thought that I had gotten into the car with him and was sort of cursing communion saying, is she crazy? What is she doing? And uh, and then I hadn't gotten into the car and he kept on saying, why don't you come into the car with me? And, uh, I just, Dave excuses that I didn't feel very comfortable yet, but, but I was really looking forward to working with him because I wanted to know more information about how this, these whole rings, prostitution rings work here in the United States. And it's really, really sad. You know, it's these t many times teenage girls who you know, are the shopping mall and they were approached by this guy who says, you're beautiful.

Speaker 5:          01:36:21       You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. I'll give you everything you need in the world. Come with me, travel with me. You know, sometimes these girls are, for whatever reason, they're, they, they're, they don't have good relationships with their parents, where they come from a bad background and they, they accept and they go travel around America with these guys. And very soon after they become, um, you know, their sex slaves and they're sold out for $200 a night. It's very, very sad. Somehow know the, keep them from escaping. They keep them from escaping. Yes. First by just persuasion, persuasion and, and being, beating them by violence. Branded with like tattoos or their pimps and stuff. Yeah. We interviewed one girl that had a dragon tattoo with the main panther, sorry, your Panther Tattoo. The name of her pimp and the back and all the girls that were in her ring all have the same tattoo.

Speaker 5:          01:37:13       And you know, sometimes they are scared to go back home. Uh, some, some of the girls get hooked on drugs. The pimps get them hooked, hooked on drugs. And, uh, and a few of the girls that we interviewed said they went to the police and told the police, but the police didn't believe them and they just arrested them for being prostitutes. So they spend a night in jail and they kept on saying they had a pimp and the police did nothing about it. And as soon as they were released, the pimp was outside of the jail waiting for them to come out, put them right back to work, to work. Yeah. I mean, they're, they're worth a lot of money, you know, shepherds, it is. It's, it was, yeah, it was, it is. It really is sad. And it was really interesting. One of the, the operations, he sort of undercover operations we did within a Charlotte, which is

Speaker 3:          01:37:55       a big place for, for these, uh, for sex trafficking. Um, because there are all these interstates, this is North Carolina, all these interstates that meet there. And, uh, so we went out with this religious group because of religious groups are out there doing a lot of outreach for sex trafficking. And we went out do this, this religious group that goes out every night or many weeks, many nights a week to look for women to try to recruit them, take them out of these rings out of prostitution essentially. And it was me and this other woman who works in this organization and we went out with, again with a secret camera Garren again, filming from the car. And as we saw girl who seemed to be sort of lost, you had just gotten out of the car, her jeans were ripped and we called her and, uh, start us, are you okay?

Speaker 3:          01:38:41       And she said, no, I'm not okay. A guy just, you know, just beat me and I'm not feeling well. And as we're talking to this girl, suddenly it's as if we had disrupted some sort of crazy sex trafficking echo system and all these pimps come out of the woodworks, out of the bushes, literally in the middle of Charlotte and the main prostitution street and come out and start circling us. And they don't know where watching because Darren's in the car watching them and start seeing these two pimps sort of circling us to find out what we, why we were talking to their girl. And uh, and that's when they came out and started calling us and then we left. But it's, it's really interesting and it's happening all around the United States.

Speaker 1:          01:39:24       Wow. It's so disturbing or no. Does that happen in countries where there's prostitution? Where's legalized prostitution? That's a very good question. I don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:39:36       I don't, I don't, I, I, I know just from out of itself, my head out, I wouldn't think, you know, obviously one of the big things, the reason why these rings exist, it's because it's illegal to be prostitutes. So the s the prostitutes, you feel safer. Um, if they want to sell themselves and feel safer having somebody who looks after them and who essentially at the end of the day takes away all their money. So this is what we heard again and again,

Speaker 1:          01:40:02       it's so, it's sort of the same issue that exists in the drug world where if you make things illegal, then you sort of create this atmosphere where only the outlaws profit. And I know that in Amsterdam where drugs are pretty much legal or at least tolerated as far as, uh, marijuana and many drugs, they have like a very low rate of addiction and very low rate of AIDS. They legalize prostitution. I would wonder how much of a, how much of this tour type of thing of sex slavery is, is mitigated by that.

Speaker 4:          01:40:43       Most places in Nevada rivalry where it's where it's legal. And I think that's the argument that a lot of the brothel owners make is that we can make it safe. We can make it, you know, um, you know, the girls that tested girls, um, are there under their own volition and, um, you know, they, they get to keep their money as opposed to at the money taken away. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:41:02       we visited some of these brothels and I was actually really different. Yeah. Different show, but, but uh, you know, they, they, they get tested for aids on a weekly basis for all sorts of sexual transmitted disease on a weekly basis. And you know, the girls feel safe. At least they're in the brothel and they're not out in the streets.

Speaker 1:          01:41:19       Yeah. I would look. And then it's another one of those things. It's like a personal freedom issue. Almost like that should a woman, if she's crazy and she loves sucks, should she be allowed to be a prostitute? I wouldn't want my daughter or my age, my friend's daughter or my friend. I wouldn't want anybody that I know doing that. I wouldn't want anyone that I know being a prostitute. But I also wouldn't want anybody I know. Being a hired killer, I wouldn't want anybody I know, uh, working on an oil field when it blows up, it is a lot of things I wouldn't want my friends to do. But do I think that they should be allowed to be a prostitute? Why is it that sex is something that everybody wants but you can't sell it? No. Why is that? I mean, I'm says, yeah, who says,

Speaker 4:          01:42:00       yeah, we've met. I mean, we've met women on all sides of this issue and you know, women that are high paid call girls and stuff like that, very much. He does it, you know, and empower him an issue. And uh, but you know, the vast majority I think of girls out there, it'd be an exploited. Um, I guess it will. And, um, I think that that's the issue and it is because, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:42:21       because it's illegal. Yeah. Me, it's, again, it goes down to that same issue of human nature. We're, we're such a strange animal. And when you tell us that something is wrong, that we can't do it, then it becomes this weird itch that people want to scratch. You know? And I, I wonder how many people actually, I wonder if that study, how many people actually go to prostitutes because it's illegal as opposed to legal, prostitutes and countries where it's tolerated. I wonder if they have, uh, you know, less people side by side study between double blind placebo prostitutes study. Exactly. Can we do it? Can we get funding for that? Well, it, it's, it's so, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's so, it seems like a pattern, you know, that exists. Things are illegal. People want to do them, bad people sell them to the people that want to do them. Then you have crime. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And then we go, there we go. Do a show about him off. Um, is there anything that you guys did during this new show that, that really shocked too? Is there anything that like it really stands out or something that you'd never expected?

Speaker 4:          01:43:22       Um, I mean I thought it was the, the, the, the, the pimp moment was, it was a shocking one. I've never seen a uh, uh, a pimp like sort of uses game, uh, to try to pick someone up before I've heard, I've heard about it, you know, secondhand stories, but to actually see, and especially since it was my wife, but that was, that was real interesting how, how they, they sorta talk about and they try to sell it.

Speaker 3:          01:43:43       I was, I was really nervous going in, not only because I was filming under cover and that is always nerve racking, but also because I was trying to apply for a job

Speaker 5:          01:43:52       just to show you sort of what, what this is like, what these with this sex trafficking underworld is like, uh, not that I was going to work as a prostitute, but just to do, to be able to get into these massage parlors and, and see how easy it is to get a job. And I was nervous that they were going to turn me down and say, I'm sorry you were to roll.

Speaker 1:          01:44:08       Ah, you know, as a woman, that's the first thing. So when this guy approaches me and starts a saying that I looked very clean, um, and you always go, hey, I came back and passed. Uh, yeah, I came back to the car. The first thing I told Daren, it's like I still have, I still got it. That's hilarious. Um, what are the subjects were covered? I mean, how many episodes you guys do? It's six episodes. Six episodes. We covered animal rights activism. Um, oh, did you count couple, the Animal Liberation Organization animal? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:44:39       no, we, we, we, we didn't really delve into that too much. What we, what we were looking into was, um, the, the guys that go on the cover and to like factory farms and film like the abuse of animals on factory farms and then they turn it into campaigns to, uh, try to get people to stop eating meat or to sort of improve conditions for, um, for factory farm animals and stuff like that. So, um, there's, yeah, the, you know, this sort of whole, um, very successful campaign by animal rights groups in the last decade or so that I've used it on the cover of camera. And so we figured, since we're doing a show about on the cover of filming, you know, like, what's a, let's see if we can, you know, hook up with these guys and see what their world is like. So we, we hooked up with this one guy who's been doing it for like 10 years and he's, he remains anonymous. Um, it goes by, you know, a fake name in the shell, but, uh, his whole life has just been penetrating these farms and capturing, uh, yeah. Pictures of abuse on, on film and stuff.

Speaker 5:          01:45:33       And this is a guy who's obviously, he's Vegan, he's completely against, uh, the eating, uh, consumption of animal meat. And he still, every day he goes to work when he goes under cover and he has to kill these animals. Um, just to be able to record what's happens inside these factory farms. And then there's, the legislation is being passed right now in several states to start to try to stop, to prohibit what these guys are doing. My filming under cover. So, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:45:56       Yeah, I've seen that. Yeah. And how's, how's that flying? How are they allowing people to do that? Because everyone is outraged when they see those videos. Even the media, they watch those videos of people. Like I saw one of this, uh, abuse that was going on when these cows, where this guy was like hitting a cow with a crowbar. There's so horrific. And again, another thing that's being exposed by technology. Yeah. I believe that that video, yeah, video

Speaker 5:          01:46:19       could have very well come from the guy that we feature. Um, he's sort of the main one of the, the biggest um, undercover animal rights activists altruists voice and blur out his face or his voice. But we definitely heard his, he was in disguise actually, but he's, he has, he's had, I don't know how many name changes throughout his life and he's been doing, it's really hard course and he's sort of, if you ever want to do any undercover is filming, this is the guy you need to talk to. And he actually gave me some training because a lot of all of this show is about undercover filming. He gave me training into filming undercover. He sent me out into a parking lot and tell me that first I had to go to that woman over there. She's a perfect stranger and you have to ask are you have to get information from her.

Speaker 5:          01:46:59       I want to know where she lived before she lived here and I had to go and do that and I passed that really easily. But then the second test that he made me do was I had to go out there and make a woman sort of run away from me because she was scared. And I'm not very good at that. I'm good at getting information from people, but I can't, it's not in my nature to be mean or too scary or intimidating and a, so I went to a starking lot and I just started acting wild, crazy and not really scary. Just crazy. Like where is water? Where can I find some water? People were just staring at me with this crazy woman probably thinking that was on bath salts or something. Why were, why were they trying to get you to do all these different big, so this is part of the training is that you have to be able to make people feel either very comfortable with you, so they give you information that you need, that you want to get for your, for your undercover filming or very uncomfortable with you so that you feel the need to either leave so you can fill more or intimidating to a point intimidated to the point that you will release any information you give without actually resorting to violence, obviously.

Speaker 5:          01:48:00       So it was really, it was really an interesting little practice that we had with them.

Speaker 1:          01:48:04       Wow. And how long has this guy been doing this?

Speaker 5:          01:48:07       10 years. Yeah. Trains other people. He's the major, the main trainer of undercover filming for animal rights activists in the United States.

Speaker 1:          01:48:15       It's an incredible guy. It seems to me that that's another one of those things where it sort of a diffusion of responsibility thing when there's so many people that want meet so many people that want, you know, food. And if he could figure out how it's stuff them into smaller packages, he can extract more ones in Zeros. Yeah, definitely correct.

Speaker 4:          01:48:32       And I mean that's just it. You know, these guys that do the undercover, you know, filming, they, they obviously have an agenda, which is they want people to become Vegan, but they, they're, they're very sympathetic to the workers who, you know, sort of toil under conditions that can be at times be pretty stressful. And that's what sort of causes them to lash out many times. Um, and then the sort of agriculture industry obviously just sees this as a, you know, a pretty big threat. You know, these guys coming in and filming on the cover and their farms and you know, their, their argument is that, you know, they're capturing, capturing these anomalies. You know, this doesn't happen every day. Um, and they're using it to sort of amplify their issue. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:49:08       What is his take on this though? His take is not that. It's not, it's not an anomaly at all. No,

Speaker 5:          01:49:13       not, he says that in every single farm he's ever entered and he's ever filmed undercover. He is witnessed animal abuse. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:49:21       Wow. That was a stake. Does he go to these organic free range places he ever tried to like, you know, the, the biggest sort of target for them with a bigger factory farm? Boy, would it freak people out though if you could go to the grass fed free range farm and wash them abusing cows to and be like, oh shit. Because that's what everybody wants to pretend I don't have any murder on my hands. Why my meat is grass fed and they smile right before they cut their throats. Right. We actually went to

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       a slaughterhouse and now actually that was probably a, that was possible. Yeah. Asked before. It would have been one of the most, probably the most surprising thing we did is we went through a slaughter house, but it was that, uh, it was that, you know, as humane ranch or certified humane ranch. And it was, you know, like we start the whole process. We saw them tagging a baby calf, like baby calf. That was just bond with born within the night, the last 24 hours. Uh, Mariana got to like tie the cashier and then, you know, we saw the other night of the process where, you know, uh, what is it 18 months later or something like that, that they're slaughtered and they'd let us onto the float of slaughter house and they said, you know, that we have an open door policy because, you know, we want to be sort of transparent as possible and you know, about how this food is raised and how it's slaughtered.

Speaker 4:          01:50:27       And, um, you know, if, you know, I've been eating meat all my life and I've never once seen a cow slaughtered. And I thought it was a really eye opening experience, you know, to be able to sort of consume thousands and thousands of meals and, and you know, not know exactly where you're so disconnected from where our food comes from, just as you know, how do they kill the cow? So they use a, what they call a knocker and they, um, basically, um, it's a like no country for old men. Yes, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. And it's sort of stuns the cow. It, you know, it doesn't kill them right away, uh, but it definitely sort of paralyzes them for a moment and puts them into a deep unconscious state. Um, and did I hang up that upside down and they slept it, throw it in, they cut the, you know, the auto reason and they never wake up from that. You don't lead them to that. So it's almost instant. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it seems fairly humane. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:51:19       It's not how it happens at every farm though. You know, again, this is a humane farm.

Speaker 1:          01:51:23       What's the least humane way they do it? Well, Osha is really bad, or I have no idea. Pretty sure kosher. They just cut their neck. I think kosher, that's, there's a process that has to be followed and I'm one of the parts of the process and involves cutting the neck. Yeah. I think they, I don't think you're allowed to use that stun thing. It's kosher.

Speaker 3:          01:51:44       Yeah. There are some things that are called standard farming, uh, procedures. I think it is, right. Standard standing far standard farming procedures and a of legal common farming practices. A perfectly legal but, but you know, so violent to see and we watched tons of videos of this that will filmed undercover. But the debate, the DP DV, King of, uh, of chickens, they don't poke each other because it gets so close to each other. Like the cutting of the tales of the pigs, all that is just hard to see. The taking away of the, the baby pigs from their mom mother is um, you know, when you can see them caged in these little tiny compartments. All that is, you know, again, common farming practices, but very hard to see. And obviously there's a lot of interest there for us to be disconnected for our food and not see what happens. And I'm not a vegetarian at all. Um, I still eat meat, but it was definitely a very interesting piece to be a part of. And, and to, to find out more about how that all works.

Speaker 1:          01:52:44       I'm not a vegetarian, I'm not a vegetarian either. But I, I certainly am not a fan of human cruelty. And I think that's the real issue. It's not whether these animals do not live forever. And uh, the reality is that there, there's quite a few realities when it comes to being a Vegan. One of them is if you do decide that no one's going to eat meat anymore and we make a law and the whole world has to let all the animals go, um, they're going to keep fucking and they're going to keep making baby animals and then he got a real problem because what are you going to do then? Are you going to castrate the males? Are you going to sterilize them in some way or are you going to reintroduce predators into the environment that you're going to have to do something to keep the population down?

Speaker 1:          01:53:25       And I dunno how you plan on doing that, but how are you going to do that and not put into jeopardy? Human beings is a reason why we rose to the top of the food chain. And one of the reasons why is because we can control our environment from predators. We can box up a city, make it nice and tall and keep out the mountain lions. And we know how to do that. There's never been a mountain lion in New York City. Santa Monica recently. See that one every time I run. And I saw one very recently in Santa Barbara, I was driving through Monosito, you know where Monosito isn't really beautiful neighborhood and this fucking thing ran across the road. And my wife initially said Coyote, she goes, look, it's a coyote. And I thought it was a coyote. Well you know we saw in our headlights and then I saw the tail and it's tail and I noticed that its body was like kind of bouncy whereas coyotes are really stiff and you know they have that sort of stiff twitchy leg movement and sort of a thing.

Speaker 1:          01:54:18       Oh Shit. Some outline and I'm like in Santa Barbara, oh man, this is crazy. It's like this is a really urban place. There's a guy, some guy had national geographic right now doing a story on like urban wildlife. And he recently released the pitcher of um, uh, I think it was a bobcat. I don't think it was a mountain lion, but it was a bobcat and it's like caught by one of those trigger cams and it's like at night. And the whole background of downtown La is it basically taken by the observatory where either lots of animals and the children running around.

Speaker 1:          01:54:49       But the Griffith Observatory is hardly La. It's pretty rural. Yeah. That's a small area that's rural, but they have coyotes biting people there. Like some homeless person went to sleep there and woke up because it got bit by a coyote. Coyote came around and tested them just to see if they could eat. Yeah. Is that good? Well the guy might have been really fucked up, you know, who knows how drunk or high or messed up because he's in our backyard constantly. Oh yeah. Watch a caddie, Nassau, all they are they still your car? Very few people in la let their cats out. Well, cause I mean you see all the missing signs in the neighborhoods or anything. It's like, sorry. You know what happens. Yeah. I live in a really rural place and there's a, there was a mountain lion siting in my neighborhood about a year ago and coyotes are there every day, sea hawks and we saw cro in our yard and all these other crows were squawking and we're trying to figure out what's going on in the crow was a, there's something wrong with it.

Speaker 1:          01:55:41       Obviously it was like kind of hobbling and hopping around in this branch, but he couldn't fly away. So we went inside and then we came out like, I don't know, a couple hours later and there was just feathers and guts everywhere. All it had to do was people had to get away for a little bit and then some Predator came swooping in. It was probably a raptor. Okay. Or you know, some sort of, yeah. Hawk hawks are everywhere around where I live, man, they're big too, man. A big creepy murderers just fly flying murders from the sky, swooped in and Jack this crow. I mean, they don't eat berries. Original drones. Yeah, hawks hawks don't steal tomatoes. They didn't have jack moving things and anything sick. I'll take care of this. I got it. They like the cleanup crew for the wounded animals. So, you know, animals eat other animals and it's another problem I would say is that okay?

Speaker 1:          01:56:32       Is it much more humane for a deer to get eaten? Slowly buy a pack of wolves. There needs to get shot by a hunter. You know, it, it, I don't like the idea of veganism, but I don't like the idea of animal cruelty either. They think that's what most people lands. Right. I've been so, um, but you know, like the, the animal rights groups that, you know, they, they I think have done an effective job of sort of getting people like us who eat meat and uh, thinking about it. Yeah. Thinking about it. Yes. You know, it is hard to watch people beating a cow or something like that and it should never exist. And it's, again, it goes back to like the same thing. It's, it's a human issue. It's about humanity. It's about what, what is causing a person to do something like that? Well, it's a mental illness. It's a sickness hitting a cow with a crow bar. What is happening? How is that possible? Yeah, I couldn't do it. You couldn't do it. Why is it happening?

Speaker 3:          01:57:24       Yeah, so I a, when we interviewed the woman who runs this humane farm, I, one of the questions I had was why do you treat that? Because they really put a lot of effort into treating these cows well while they're alive. Why? Why do you put such emphasis and treating well the cows, if you know they're going to die, if you, you know, the farm's going to kill them anyway. And she said exactly because we are going to kill them and use them for meat. They're going to be our food. Exactly. Because of that we, it is, it is mandatory for us to treat them well. And I really like that philosophy.

Speaker 1:          01:57:52       I think that's a beautiful philosophy. I watched a, an episode of Anthony Bourdain's old show, no reservations. And the, one of the things, it was about this place in New York that is, um, they are not just a restaurant there, a restaurant and they have their own butcher shop and they also have their own farm. So they grow all of their food. I guess it was Maine. They, yes. Okay. I'm confusing two different things. One of them was a, a butcher shop that's also a farm and they grow their own food and they kill their own animals and then sell the meat. So you know, you're getting it humanely. And the other one was a farm in Maine where they, they locally source everything from their own farm, all their food, all, all the vegetables, all the animals. And they were showing all the different pigs they raise and they're petting the pigs and you know, talking about the different parts that are going to be, and it's Kinda weird because you're like, well that's your pet in that thing and they're going to kill it.

Speaker 1:          01:58:46       But is it, is it better that way? Yeah, it's better that way. It'd be nice to him until he decided to be really mean, you know? Yeah. I mean, it's probably one of those things that as we developed synthetic meat, oh man. Yeah, we're probably going to move away. Well, they're really close. Then some guy in like London or England has done it Rad. He's figured out how to do it. He's made the first hamburger or something like that. I don't know. I don't know where they have, but I do know that they're, they're capable of doing things now where they can reproduce cells and they can reproduce certain types of tissue. Like, um, Kurzweil was telling me about this woman who had something wrong with her esophagus. So they built an Esophagus, a out of biodegradable material, used skin cell stem cells, and you use the biodegradable material as a scaffolding.

Speaker 1:          01:59:39       Stem cells built a brand new esophagus and they operate on her, installed the new one, and now she's fine, you know? And that's like, they're making parts for humans. So that just seems to make sense that they're going to make meat. Like, and I don't know how to feel about that. Yeah. Maybe vegans will eat like a fake stick. Yeah. Maybe they're down with that. Yeah. It really is delicious and Karma free. Nice Karma free cheeseburger. That'd be awesome. Yeah. I think that's inevitable. It's common. I mean, they're going to there you're talking about doing it with humans. They're talking about developing parts that are completely artificial, completely artificial cells that interact with yourselves with no immune response. There are, they're talking about these things being an inevitability of the future. That's not science fiction fact. It's all based on proven research and, and uh, there's proof of concepts already available and it just seems to make sense.

Speaker 1:          02:00:40       They're going to have a fake chicken, a fake headless chicken running around just waiting for you to eat it. Breasts and legs doesn't know what's going on. That literally has no brain. It's not that they're stupid. They have zero brains because every chicken stupid. But this would be like, there's nothing going on. You don't have to worry at all it. Right. Pick it up and kill it. You know what I mean? Killing it. I know a lot of other lists. It's like all the million things that need to do. We need, yeah, we've actually had to kill a chicken. But in Colombia that was, it's, it's not a pretty process taking, taking the feathers off the chicken. And it seems to be the, the, the, the real thing about killing an animal and eating an animal is the fact that this, it's not just that it's alive because vegetables are alive as well.

Speaker 1:          02:01:24       It's the fact that it's alive and it can move and feel pain. But if you could take away the whole field pain part and they can't think and just headless chickens like you gotta you know, you have some new sort of a way to make the heartbeat without a brain just really fucking stupid headless checkins he can still wouldn't go for it cause they don't eat eggs. And uh, I have chickens and the chickens lay an egg every day and you can eat the eggs and no one gets hurt. But the deacons are still not down with that? No, they're not. But that's how far removed we are from the farm is that I only found out that chickens lay an egg a day like two years ago. Yeah, it's true. I had no idea. Oh, I only found out that a an egg doesn't become a chicken.

Speaker 1:          02:02:10       I thought that an egg became a chicken and the, oh you eat them before it happens. But no, it's a hen lays an egg whether the roosters involved or not. But if the roosters in the house then the chicken can get pregnant and then the egg can become a check. But if there's no rooster, I didn't know that. See, most people don't know that isn't it? It's amazing how removed we are from the whole process of food. So there's no life there. No Life at all. Zero, zero life, zero thread of life. Impossible to make life. And in fact if you don't eat the egg then the chickens will probably eat their own eggs and go crazy and I'll come fucking cannibals or something. I don't know. And they do eat their own eggs. If you don't leave them in too long for vegans though, the problem is not that they are eating because they would be life in Yag.

Speaker 1:          02:02:56       It's because you're eating an egg that comes from a chicken that is probably being abused in order to produce these days. Sure. I think the thinking behind it, but you could have it the way I have it where my, my chickens live on a, on a full day of a full acre lawn and they go inside the chicken coop at night, which is huge and it's, we set it up like, cause we wanted to make it as nice as possible. Super humane, really big place. Like the chicken coop itself is bigger than this studio where I have 14 chickens and they just go in whenever they want at night and we shut the door and lock it down. So you get 14 eggs a day. What do you do with them? I eat them all 14 delicious. I don't need them all. I mean hell the whole family.

Speaker 1:          02:03:33       But I give them to friends if they want him to. Yeah, just they just started laying the eggs recently. But yeah, we had people over this weekend and we gave him some fresh eggs. It tastes delicious too. Yeah, cause we give the chickens like vegetables, like we buy vegetables, like say I make Kale shakes pretty much every morning and it's cucumbers and Kale and celery and fruit and stuff like that. So a lot of times you have like leftover stuff left over Kale and leftover. And we feed them that and then we feed them chicken feed and they wander around the lawn and they basically eat anything they find that tried to heat your house. They're stupid. Stupidest Shit. Peck at your house, you're like, hmm, maybe this house is edible. They did is checking everything for food, but they've become like our pets. You know, they're not, they're not chickens that we're eating, we're just getting eggs out of him.

Speaker 1:          02:04:14       But it's amazing how much you get out of them. They give you food and that food is based entirely on food that you give them. So it's just this process. It's like a natural healthy cycle and nobody gets hurt. They're happy when they see ya, you know, there's no cruelty involved. And so for me it's like I just started doing this really recently. We started growing her own vegetables and raising her own chickens and not as like a doomsday prepper sort of a thing. But just as like, let's see what this is like. You know, my wife's super got into it, so it's been really fun. It's been kind of cool. What vegetables you grow all sorts of. Um, we grow a hot peppers, we grow cucumbers who go tomatoes, we grow squash, we grow lots of different things that you can eat kale. Uh, we haven't started doing that yet, but that's the next step.

Speaker 1:          02:04:59       You know, Kale, I'm, we're, we're trying to move our little a garden to a new spot and we have this new area we're going to set up. It gives a lot of sunlight and the idea is to just, uh, the, the best idea I think would be completely self sustaining. We're going to go solar power too. But one of the things we found out is like, solar doesn't help you if the power goes out. You still need a generator. And I was like, that's stupid. That's so dumb. Like how is that possible? Like the guy explained to me at the soccer boys go, I go, so if the power goes out we're still out because no, actually you have to have a generator. And I go, what? What are you talking about? What does that mean? It doesn't make any sense. Like somehow or another there's gotta be a way to have a completely standalone system, but uh, it's, it's not that easy.

Speaker 1:          02:05:42       I think you have to have, cause your house is still connected to the grid is that maybe could be, I mean it maybe be completely removed from the grid maybe. Oh yeah. I would think that would be the smartest thing anybody could do. No, it's not that I'm a doomsday prepper. It's at like, I think to be self sustainable would be ultimately what I want to do. These are my beginning steps. Ultimately what I want to do is get a bunch of friends involved and buy piece of land, build houses and have a farm on it. Not a cult. Just get like a few couples. Sounds a little culty, a little call culty everything I do is a little culty but I, I, I do, it's a fine dance but my idea is to um, have a, a large plot of land, you know, like several hundred acres with a few families and everyone sort of have, uh, this big space that's their own and we share it and like a community farm and that everyone gets their food from there that way.

Speaker 1:          02:06:37       See, what I'm weird things about neighborhoods is that you don't pick them, you sort of just, you pick where your neighborhood is. Of course, if you can, if you have that freedom but you don't really pick your neighbors if they're there when you, we, we liked this house. We like, you know, Manhattan beach, let's move in. And then you're moving into a bench around a bunch of people that you don't even know. Whereas the whole idea of community and culture and, and tribes used to be that we lived near all of our loved ones. We had them all together. We don't do that anymore. It's kind of rare playing the lottery game. Get a day as you often do if you won the load. And that was definitely on the top of my list. I'd buy a big house, but that I could be lots of houses around and I could move all the people I love around me, my friends and family and yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:07:23       Well I've actually, we've actually sat down, uh, our family sat down with a couple of other families that we really like and we actually started talking about doing that and uh, where we've decided to make some, uh, have some meetings, have some dinners where we meet and discuss the idea and look at like various locations whether or not be feasible with all the people that they all have sort of alternative entertainment type jobs, like comedians and writers and stuff like that. And so we're all just sitting there like what an awesome community that would be into til the live in a place where you're in a town where there's a, you know, like a, a good town, like a healthy place with city that's close by, but set up an establishment where you could grow your own food so you don't have to worry like is this organic or these grass raised is this farm, you know, farm healthy and clean.

Speaker 1:          02:08:10       It's your own farm and it wouldn't be hard to do. And if you think about how much money you spend on food every year, it seems to me that if you have quite a few people hiring some really competent, nice people to run a farm for you, while people would appreciate a good job where they work for nice people and everybody's ethical about the whole situation and how everything's done and fair and you set up a nice little community farm. I said, I don't think that that's impossible. That doesn't seem like a a big dream. That seems like something that's entirely doable, you know, and a new reality show. Yeah, that's where it all goes.

Speaker 1:          02:08:51       Well, it seems like you'd get to need some money for sure. You need it. Need some money to set up almost anything, but the real problem would be you'd have to planning and you know, you'd have to get permits to build houses and or you'd have to buy a bunch of houses together, which is he even more ridiculous and how are you going to pull that off? That would be hard, but I just think that ultimately that seems like it would be the ideal situation to get all of your food that way. Not all of it. I mean, he's still go to the supermarket and buy mayonnaise and some shit. You don't want to sit around making yourself, but how beautiful would it be to not worry like, okay, the power goes out. Well guess what? We have power. Okay. The supermarkets are empty. We have a farm.

Speaker 1:          02:09:32       We get all of our food from this with this area. Then you just have to worry about the other people. Yeah, you shit hits the fan. Chickens. Crops took this to a doomsday place. Again, that's what I do. Try to stay positive, um, guns and six episodes. So any, any other interesting topics. And we did one about homeless youth where we actually spent a lot of time with a young people who are homeless out here in Los Angeles. And we spent a couple of nights sleeping under the bridge. Oh. Oh my God, you did? Yeah, we did both of you together.

Speaker 4:          02:10:07       You live in La, you know, it's like driving downtown or Hollywood and you see all these homeless kids and sometimes adults in. Did you guys go to skid row? So we went to skid row. It starts off in skid row and um, you know, we explained that place for people who don't know. Good row is the largest homeless community in the nation. That's, I mean, uh, thousands and thousands of homeless people. Yeah, it is. I mean, it's, uh, sleeping on the streets in tents and know they've, they've tried various times to clean it up. Um, but, um, it's, you know, there's a lot of issues there. It was like, where are you going to, where are you going, how's them? Um, and there's a lot of, um, housing and there is a lot of shelters down there, but not enough to sort of meet the demand of how many homeless people were actually down there.

Speaker 4:          02:10:50       And so if you go down there, um, day or night and you'll see, you know, uh, hundreds if not thousands of people walking the streets, um, you know, with their carts and it's, it's just, um, another, uh, side of the city that, you know, you, you, it's actually right next to the archduke shut shutdowns downtown. And so it's, you know, it's sort of, you, you, you, you've run across it here and there if you're living in la. But it's definitely a and eye open experience and walk down there because there's a whole ecosystem down there that, um, sort of, uh, caters to not cater is probably not the right word, but you know, like that is a s supports, um, the homeless down there, um, from, uh, you know, clinics and shelters and stuff like that too, obviously drug the others and uh, and gangs that sort of run the territory down there because, um, as the activist who we fall down there told us, you know, it's not just the homeless community, it's the, probably the largest concentration of addicts in the, in the country as well. Because most people, obviously if you're living on the streets, you're either dealing with the mental health issue or a, some sort of addiction or both. Um, so, um, yeah, we've, that was crazy

Speaker 1:          02:12:04       was, it was fairly eyeopening I'm sure, to see the population, right?

Speaker 3:          02:12:07       It was, and it was, it's the, the, the idea is that if you are sort of above 35 and you're homeless, you're on skid row. If you're under 35 and you're homeless here in Hollywood, and that's even more sort of surprising because you think of Hollywood, you think of the walk of fame, right? You think of all the stars and celebrities and then you know for us who live here in La and we drive by the Hollywood every day and you see all those homeless kids every day and you know that they're sleeping out on the streets and this, again because of mental health issues or addiction or just because they come from broke, broke up, broke down families and have nowhere to sleep, which was some of the cases of the people that we filmed. And so we decided it was sort of important if we weren't really going to dive deeper and deeper into this issue to spend the night with them, two of the people that we were filming,

Speaker 1:          02:12:51       I would have faked it. I did it just like that dude. The what? Not Survivor man. Who's real les Stroud. Who's the other guy? The fake guy who's English dude? Uh, some bastard. Their bedroom. Yeah. He sleeps in hotels. Oh yes he does. He got busted. No Way. Yes he did. Yes. What I like is that when you, I can't really describe it. Go ahead. I like that. It's all you're always like, and now I'm here in the middle of nowhere. You can't see I'm, you know that there's like a big camera and a camera guy and everything. Filming. Well that's one of the beautiful things about Les Stroud. There's nothing but him. He brings cameras and a backpack. He does everything himself. He sets up the cameras. He even has videos of him up the cameras so you could see him when he walks off.

Speaker 1:          02:13:34       Like he would walk a hundred yards in the distance of films. He has to go back and get the camera and then take it and put it a hundred years. [inaudible] I'm a hundred yards forward and have him walking towards it. Like he sets everything up from south. It's very time consuming and survivor man, survivor man is the real one. The the, the other one bear whatever the fuck it is. It's Horesh wild total horse shit. And the reason why that show was created was because Les Stroud wouldn't play ball with producers and set up fake shots. They wanted to like, oh less stumbled upon this dead animal. This is how you, you know, fix this dead animal so you could eat it. This is how you meet or cut it up. Bear Grylls does all that stuff. So he's like, you know, he would do it. He would fudge shit and Les Stroud. So the only way to do this is to do it real.

Speaker 1:          02:14:18       Yeah. So he like will starve. He'll be out there for five days with no food, you know, and really freaking out and not knowing whether or not he's going to get out of there and trying to figure out how to alert the crew and how to start a fire when it's raining out. Like all that stuff is real. When you watch that show, he deals 100% of it, which is, it's so fascinating. When people found out about the other show, the bear Grylls show, they were like, get out. Fuck that Guy Sleeps in tents. No, come on man. He's out there for real. They'll hotels. Really? He really is in a four seasons. Oh Man. Like he's pretending he's covered in mud to keep the flies off your face. You got a smile on your face in mud. No mud dude. He in a mud mask.

Speaker 1:          02:14:58       He's getting a feet massage. Pretending he's out there. It's fake as fuck. It's totally fake. You know, like this one found like a dead sheep and he like turned the, she like, like the clothing out of it. That's probably fake too. Um, you know, I don't know. I would assume he's not taking his own pen. I mean, if you're going to fake everything else, why wouldn't you fake drink home? I hate to admit this, drinking my own piss. I'm drinking my own piss before. Well because someone told me that, um, there's a thing called in therapy and he said that why? Like this is a person who has covered investigative journalism for her whole life. She's seen horrific things. She's been to the, the oxycontin center of the world. I would tell her, check my own people just immediately like, what is wrong with you?

Speaker 1:          02:15:45       Um, can you leave now several athletes and have a thought that it's a good thing to do that somehow or another you get vitamins that pass through your body and then you recycle them in your urine and that your urine is sterile and it's not nothing to worry about. And it's actually antibodies and you're, it's very controversial. But I had done it to see if there's anything to, like when I was sick, I took a drink, my own p for times and I don't know whether it room temperature right out of the hatch, right into a cop and down the old pipe. It's more, I don't recommend it. First of all, it was really clear and I don't do it all the time. I've done it a few times once on the radio. I'm just cause I wanted to it cause I'm not squeamish. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:16:25       I hosted fear factor for six years. Right. I know what's bad and what's not drinking your own urine. Even if it's terrible. It's no big deal compared to some of the shit that I've seen face. I've seen face to face. People eat horrific things and not just once. I've seen it hundreds of times. So it's like for me drinking my own pee. Oh God. Animal Dicks, urine 24 ounces of donkey come. I saw people drank donkey semen. That was what got the show canceled actually. Um, they had a drink, donkey, semen and the TMC got ahold of the video and got unlocked. It got online before the show aired and then a NBC pulled the episode first and then cancel the whole show. That was, yeah, that was the second run season. A fear factor. The video's online. Can we take it? Yeah, exactly. Well that's the thing is that that was approved by the network.

Speaker 1:          02:17:16       That's the most fascinating aspect of it. And when I say by the network, I should not say by the network, I can say some executive that decided for the network. That's what I should say. Whether or not represents the cooperation of NBC as a whole. I think that'd be misjudging it cause they pulled it when they found out about it, but someone thought it would be a brilliant idea to make people drink come, you know they say like, Oh seems reasonable as it's, well it's not going to kill me. Oh yes. Not just one. Three people drink it. Yeah. There was three. It was twins and three groups. Twins. The video is actually available online. You can still get it because in other countries they didn't censor it in other countries, fear factors and all the, everything in the air like more than a dozen countries worldwide. And they are in other countries.

Speaker 1:          02:17:58       That's customary though. That's actually one of the ways that we got it passed really New Zealand. Um, one of the things about fear factor is if we ate, especially during the first season, if anyone, if we aired people eating things, it had to be something that people ate in other countries. So like insects are very common. People in poor countries eat insects all the time. In fact, insects are probably eaten more than livestock and a lot of countries. Um, so that was an easy one. We could prove that. And then, uh, in New Zealand they started selling shots of horse, semen at bars, like as a novelty. And people would, uh, you know, Mosey up to the bar and buy a shot, a horse, semen. And apparently they said it gave him energy and all sorts of crazy things were attributed to it. Most likely placebo faculty, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:18:46       Um, but they even have a good story afterwards. He got to justify it somehow. Somehow or another, you've got to say, listen, I know it seems crazy, but I feel awesome. I drank that whore. He's probably so freaked out that you drank horse come, you don't know what's going on in your body. Your fingers are tingling. You can't feel your feet even know what the fuck you just did. Um, so because of that, NBC said, well, the people are serving it and there's, there's uh, we brought them a new story, not we, and it was not my idea. I should stress that. And so that allowed them to sign off on people drinking 24 ounces of donkey come 24 hours. Yeah. It was ridiculous. Not only that, how about the contestants? Uh, he at least had a shot at winning some money, but we had PA's drink it and they, they only did it because it was part of their job.

Speaker 1:          02:19:33       Just the friends of them, they got like a hundred bucks. No, no, no. See if it can be done. Whenever do we do a stunt on fear factor? There was several times where we'd look at a stunt where there was a physical task or whether it was something, some someone eating something. We had to figure out what's the correct amount and whether or not physically a task could be completed. So the, the physical aspect was handled by stunt man first of all, who would look at it and say, well you shouldn't do it that way cause I don't think the guy could do that. And if he does do that, it's probably gonna hurt himself in this way or that way. And then with the eating thing, this really only way to find out you got it. Like how many bugs can I person eat?

Speaker 1:          02:20:11       Hmm, let's see. Okay, we'll try to get a phd 10 and then let the PA would have like 10 minutes. He 10 bugs and they'd be like three bugs in just rolling. And you're like, okay, this is too much. Let's cut it down to five or you know, we'd, we'd have to make it some sort of a reasonable amount. So you'd have to have more than one pa because you want to have a control group. So you know, those a few pas and I hope you pay them really well. I would give them extra money. I would give them extra money all the time, especially the horrific ones. I don't remember how many dollars I go. Several hundred dollars. I gave one of the extra pas, but that's nothing. Several hundred dollars the fuck man, you just strike to calm. You know what's really making a note here that next time have a PA complaints to us. I think we should tell them about fear factor. Yeah. Being a PA socks for a lot of a lot of places. I mean sometimes it's cool, you know, but for the most

Speaker 5:          02:20:57       park not good. We were offered, actually we didn't eat. We off. We were offered um, monkey brain in the Amazon, but that's it. The time remembering. What was that awful? It wasn't the break, it was just monkey. No, it was a monkey head. He cut off the monkey, the hills there. And then what was it that you, you ate that I hated that had all those hairs. It was the little hairs. The, the Armadillo of the Amazon, the Tattoo, that tool. And it's an Armadillo and Amazonian armadillos. Hey, spelled tattoo. T. T. U. T. No, I think that to you. Maybe I should know this, but I know, yeah, you should. What's up, just like, Hey, I'm from Portugal. We don't have thought too is in our, my country.

Speaker 1:          02:21:40       Oh, but port is um, the Brazilian Portuguese or same everything. Same. Yeah, like you don't, there's nothing. No confusion.

Speaker 5:          02:21:49       And there's some words here and there are different, but not English and American. I went to talk to all this. This is what Darren is. There it is. Whoa. It's an ugly looking thing, right? How do you spell that? It tastes like it looks g. T. U. T. A. T you. Wow. What a creepy looking thing. It was awful. It tasted, I mean worse than it looks like

Speaker 1:          02:22:10       there's also a Russian music duo of pot Russians called tattoo tonight to you. And there's always pictures of them. Like

Speaker 5:          02:22:18       good touching. Yeah. I didn't mean to. But the thing is that when they've never, when we eat, the meat, hair is still there,

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       so they sort of burn. They don't take the hit. So it's slightly burned from the barbecuing of the meat. That's it. You can still taste it and it tastes awful. It really does. But they love it. It's a delicacy there. They did. They did.

Speaker 1:          02:22:38       It just tastes terrible. It tastes, it tastes like, uh Oh. What's that? Oh Man. What's this stuff? Um, three tribes. Tribe, tribe, tribe. You really, yeah. I like 'em udo. Uh, yeah. I log my noodle. I like tribe and Menudo and organs and all that stuff. It's a little game. Here is a place in boulder, Colorado called the pop who says, Oh man, we should go there all the time. If you ever, if you're in boulder, it's a, um, I guess it's not Mexican. It's a Spanish food. Maybe it is Mexican. Pupusa as though they have the most sensational menudo. It's amazing. It's all like hearts and Oregon's and liver and tripe. Sounds terrible. It's fantastic. It's fantastic stuff. Super legit. Yeah. Like that with this one place, it's like so good. Spicy and like, oh, they say it's hangover cure. I think it's just so good.

Speaker 1:          02:23:29       You forget the fact that you're hung over. Right. So what I've had in other places, and it's nasty, like I had an a place in Atlanta, it tastes like shit. It's all about doing it. It's definitely tasted like shit. That'd be, it wasn't, it wasn't good. I've had menudo and then maybe it's not a fair comparison. Well, if you live in the middle of the Amazon you got here, what were you going to, he was there. Right? Do they eat those copy borrows, those crazy big rat things to eat those things. It must, I mean it must and we saw a couple of, we didn't get in but we saw the copy virus everywhere. I think anything is theirs is open. It's open season for whatever's there if you're actually need to survive there. Um, yeah, the crazy shit. Do they jaguars? Well, probably not there. Hardly there. It's actually really hard to see it like that. Like I think most people that come in contact with them is, it's too late. It's too late. Yeah. They're like really stealth predators.

Speaker 3:          02:24:23       You know, I was almost attacked by a Jaguar. Really? So we went, we went to do the story on the Campbell frog looking for the pharmaceutical pharmaceutical promise of the Amazon. And we went in with two herpetologists. These are guys who study poisonous amphibians and snakes and they go out every month. They go out for a week at a time and they go deep, deep, deep into the Amazon. I mean they take a canoe deep inside where there's nothing around and they said that we, after much haggling, they decided that they were going to take these two gringos along with them. Me and Darren and we are camped out in the middle of nowhere. There's nothing there's we put out are we bought, we bought a couple of um, hammocks. We hung them as soon as we got there and then at night they go out with these lights, with these headlamps to look for the most dangerous and most venomous venomous snakes and frogs they are on in the world, in the middle of the Amazon.

Speaker 3:          02:25:14       It was a crazy, crazy experience, but for some reason because we were filming it and we were on this high of filming this documentary and how cool it would be if we found the most dangerous thing in the world. For us it was, we didn't feel like scared and we thought it was great. We were filming all this crazy stuff. We got back to the hammocks at night and I'm sleeping on the edge because they decided they wanted to give me a little privacy. So it was a sort of like little wooden camp thing and I, but no walls, no roof, nothing, just these hammocks. And I was on the last hammock right on the edge and in the middle of the night I woke up, nobody told me that in the Amazon it gets really cold at night. So we had nothing to protect us and we had these mosquito nets.

Speaker 3:          02:25:51       And middle of the night I, I heard, I woke up because I was freezing. And then I heard and we'd been talking about all the stories they've been telling us, all these stories on the, the, the all side they call it, they also, they are and how the, it's the most dangerous animal in the Amazon. And suddenly I start hearing it, a hearing, breathing right next to my head and it was breathing in is breathing really hard and I could smell it, I could smell. It was a big creature of big, hairy, scary creature breeding right next to me. And I had one of those, you know, when you have those dreams and you try to scream and it does, nothing comes out. That happened to me. I panicked and I was trying to call out for Darren or for the other guys and nothing came out.

Speaker 3:          02:26:29       Like I was literally frozen, panicked and Darren woke up with my breathing because I was breathing really heavily and really scared and he asked me, are you okay? And I was able to get out just, and Darren comes up to me and uh, I told him I was about to be attacked by an author by a Jaguar. And we went around the camp with the lights just so I could see that there was nothing there. In the morning after I wake up, I look at my bag and it was full of hair, full of hair. And I said, I told you I knew it. I knew. And I told the scientists that were with us, you know, I saw, I know it was a Jaguar. I was right next to me. And then we looked around and there was a freaking stray dog that had come from like an Indian reservation calls by Ann had been the stray dog.

Speaker 1:          02:27:17       Oh. So it would have been a much,

Speaker 3:          02:27:19       sorry if it was a Jaguar. It was the scare of my life

Speaker 1:          02:27:26       for no reason. Just smell of death. The mosquito netting is just a dream. I am terrified of big cats more than anything on the planet. They're there. So I have cats at home, like little cats and I just watched the way they move, I'd jump on, we feed them on, they're all, they was eat on the counter, which is the equivalent of me jumping on the roof of this building. I mean, it's not happening, but to them it's like bullying. They just, they just hop up on the counter and eat it. It's so crazy to think that there's one of those that's 200 pounds and it's black as night and it's wandering the jungle.

Speaker 3:          02:28:03       Yeah, it's, uh, that's what I was thinking about when that was breathing heavily. And

Speaker 1:          02:28:08       what is the, what kind of poison and stuff did you guys find when you're out there?

Speaker 3:          02:28:12       Bushmaster awesome. The snake, not the gun, not the gun. Um, a lot of things, but you know, ultimately we were afraid of all these things and actually Darren has a fascination for, for snake. So he wasn't as scared as I was, but what got us was several months after we came back. Um, I had this little thing growing on my finger that I thought it was just a bug. And then I decided I had to get it checked out because he was growing and growing and suddenly possible was coming out of it. So I thought it was maybe skin cancer. And I went to dermatologist and turns out I got a flesh eating Perez. Couple leishmaniasis that I caught in Brazil only exists in a few parts of the world. So they didn't have the treatment here. So by CDC, the Center for Disease Control had to make a special treatment for me. That was, that had a nurse come to my house and, and it was, it was pretty scary.

Speaker 1:          02:28:55       That's why I say fuck going in the air. I hear stories like that. Um, it's near that or what does that show the enemy inside you or something like that as a show that it was always about people going to these places and catching parasites. Uh, yeah. They don't realize they have them until they crawls across their eyeball. They started having weird behavior because there's like a baseball size cluster of worms growing inside their head.
