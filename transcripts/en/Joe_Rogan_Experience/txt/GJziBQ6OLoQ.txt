Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Four, three, two, one. Okay, so I'm on my way over here and I'm listening to this new radio lab podcast and then talking about this new technology that's available. I'm like, this is the perfect thing to be listening to right when I'm coming to hang out with Eddie Bravo. Oh No. There's a website called future of fake news.com where they show this new technology on display. Well you know how adobe does photoshop and so they can. They can adjust images. They can take 20 to 40 minutes to. They could do it with 20. They prefer to do it with 40, 40 minutes of recorded audio of you talking. Then they run it through this machine and they can have you say words you've never said thinking of you make sounds that you've never made in those. In those little sentences. That's so like you could have a sentence that.

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       Yeah, like you can have a sentence that says like a, hey joe, you want to get something to eat after the podcast and they can intersect. Hey Joe, I got a bunch of transgender hookers and some heroin. You want to get something to eat and go hang out with them after the podcast, and it would sound exactly like what you said. It looks sound exactly like your own word, but I'm sure there's going to be experts that can analyze it and go, this is, this is a fraud for now. What they're essentially saying is this is, uh, the infancy of it. You have to get like experts to analyze the audio. You could see it right there. They'd synthesized Barack Obama's a audio and they have them say things that he never said the, they have him and George Bush going back and forth telling jokes to each other that they never told.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       Dude, I. can we hear this? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So now can we think you're talking about find that. Okay. See if you can find that. It might be on their website. Um, it doesn't sound good when they're doing that, but it's in its infancy, but it sounds like them talking, it just, it sounds a little edited, you know, it's not flowing together. Right. But apparently they're able to break down faces to the point where say there were saying that like if Jennifer Aniston goes to China and she does a commercial for something, what they can do is have Jennifer Aniston talk for a period of time and they figured out how her, her voice moves and they take all these images of her face and they can manipulate it so accurately they can have someone speaking mandarin Chinese where all the different, you know, different sounds they make and they could sync up her lips and her movement and the movement of her face to what it would look like if she was making those actual sounds, which is just amazing. So then they can have a voice like a mandarin speaking woman who could speak in Chinese and you would see the exact correct movements from Jennifer Aniston's mouth. So it wouldn't like, you know how you watch like a movie though, right? But let's hear, let's hear it.

Speaker 2:          00:02:44       Our parties have moved further and further apart and it's harder and harder to find common ground. So what I said in 2004 that there were no red states, blue states through the United States of America was

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       wrong. So you could tell by the lips in that one. Yeah. Have you looked at his lips? It looked fun, but that's just now like what's it going to be like in a year? What's it going to be like in five years? And this is. This is what they're saying is that we're, we're looking at now is the future of fake news. They're going to be able to recreate people saying things that they never said and it's going to be impossible for you to tell the difference. So how can that be used for the Illuminati? How could it be used for anybody? That's the problem. Anybody can see the problem is that good enough DC, oh now we can do this. I don't know. It's hard. It's hard to say what would be good because you never know what the end result of anything is going to be.

Speaker 1:          00:03:41       When someone creates some sort of a mind bending world changing technology like that. It only could be for bad because it's a lie. It's not going to be alive. Whatever it comes out of their mouth, it's going to be a lie so that there's no way that could be good. Yeah, but see what it is is the consequences of technologists pushing boundaries. So the problem is it's not. Their intention is not initially to do something bad. That's one of the interesting things about the radio lab. Probably funny. Hold on because the radio lab podcast talk to the technologists and they confronted her with it and it's very uncomfortable to watch this lady be confronted with the idea like what if this is used for evil? Like what if it's used for fake news and you could tell that they don't. They're not even thinking about that.

Speaker 1:          00:04:23       Hardly all they're trying to do is figure out how to do something that nobody else can do. Like when someone comes up with the technology, if you can come up with some sort of a voice manipulating technology like that or a visual manipulating technology, you've got to realize there's a bunch of other people that are probably closing in on something like that too, and it becomes this mad race to get something done and to make a shit ton of money. If you have something like that that could be potentially worth who knows ungodly sums of money. I'm just trying to figure out a way you could use that for good to go away. The one thing that they were saying is you could take recordings of Einstein. There's hours and hours and hours and hours of recordings of Einstein. You could create a visual Einstein and you could have a three d technology perhaps or virtual reality technology where you're hanging out having a fucking conversation with Einstein and now step one.

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       Right? Step two is some sort of a neural interface with virtual reality where instead of just looking at it through goggles, it's going into your mind in some sort of a way. It's interfacing with the very neurons and the very, your visual cortex. It's showing you images that you're, you know, you wouldn't really be seeing for sure. It would be great for brainwashing though. Yeah. Oh, for sure. That's a no brainer. That's for sure. Because we're brainwashed, but they like fake news. Just like you said, the thing is perfect. No one gets out alive with this shit. So this is the thing. There's one thing that might be fascinating about it is there's gonna be no control, like everyone's going to be able to eventually use something like this and they said that it would require like painstaking step by step a person going over the data to see if they could figure out what was manipulated and they think they could find like 75 percent of the ones that have been manipulated right now find the fake ones.

Speaker 1:          00:06:15       But the problem is the amount of time that it takes to do that is astounding. Crazy. It's an. It's people to people time like you have. You have to be sitting there like going over it, looking at what is this? Check that out, go back. What's this number right here? Why is this off? What's going on here? Okay, mark that move on and they have to like do this over and over and over again. They'll lifts her anomalies. Look for some sort of evidence that has been manipulated by a digital source or by some sort of a digital control, a phone or a computer or something like that. I think it'll be easy to tell from the beginning. Maybe. What do you mean? How good are photoshops? Like the Photoshop, Steve, how good are some of his photoshops and this dude is just having fun.

Speaker 1:          00:06:51       Well, how about that? Photoshop of A. I think it's Neil Armstrong where he's standing on the moon and if like there's a shot, there's a shot of him looking down. It's like a selfie and then there's the earth in the background and they proved that's a photo, a photo shop already. I mean they could just run it through shit. Just basic shit. And you could see that it was cut in. Well there was definitely some manipulation of photos for press use this. Not just that was. That was 1969. Well, they did it before that even they did it with the Gemini Space Program when we did a defending that picture. No, it's good. No, it's real. Nobody defends that picture. Well, I don't know if they do or don't, but the craziest one is Michael Collins because Michael Collins, you can prove it. The Gemini 15 picture, they took a test photo of him like in some sort of a warehouse where they would strap him up with a harness and they're showing them how to utilize this equipment and then they blocked all that shit out and reverse the image and try to pretend he was doing a spacewalk.

Speaker 1:          00:07:46       Never seen it. Uh, and maybe maybe. I mean I've seen so much on the moon. This one's the best one. Not Even the moon. It's just Michael Collins. But you should see it because it's like, wait a minute, why the fuck would they do that? Like they took a photo. This is a 100 percent. This is not speculation. They took a photo of him at a test facility where they would prepare themselves for walking on the moon. The one on the left is then preparing. See, you could tell he's in a harness, there's a bunch of equipment around and he's hanging onto this thing and they're pulling them like with this harness that he's attached to. And then the next one it says it's a spacewalk. It's the same exact image. They just blacked it out. They just took all the stuff that was in the background, all the equipment and all the bullshit that's kind of a blurry copy. See you can find a better copy of it. But what they did was they made a fake photo of a guy in space that photo's not real. That's a photo of him in the test suit and they just reversed it and blacked out the background. They could get away with stuff like that back then, man. It wasn't, that's a better picture of it. There you got to get a, that's a good, uh, representation. It's

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       just what, what they did was take all that shit. What they did was unquestionably deceptive. So the question is how much of that did they do? Oh, come on. Well, that's the question. The question is, it's even hard for the most hardcore of skeptics, not even the most hardcore skeptics. They're like, yeah, I'm on the fence about that moon thing. You know, I'm. No one's really. No one's really saying yes. He went to the moon. Now even like Mick Westville shut up about that. You know, there's Niki. We'll. I don't think you're right at all. I think he would definitely argue that we went to the moon. Well, he's getting paid for that. So they come in and he's got to. I mean the dude, the dude backs up every official story. Yeah, but people do that. Not necessarily because they're getting paid. They do it because that's the mindset they're in.

Speaker 3:          00:09:41       They're in this mindset like we were talking about someone else before the podcast website. He makes money on his website. That's what I'm talking very little money to be made of bumping things. That's not the motivation for doing it when you're a multimillionaire from video games. I mean, he made a shit ton of money from, from selling video games. He was like a some sort of a programmer in video games and then he has a good time debunking things, but he has an official story mentalities, what I would call it, where no matter what, like there's people that are objective and there's people that are debunkers and he's a debunker and it doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong about a lot of stuff, but it does mean that he goes into things with the intention to debunk and the intention to almost always gravitate towards an official stores.

Speaker 3:          00:10:25       Every single t he blended. He believes Harvey Oswald acted alone. Yeah. That's a goof. Come on, man. That one's goofy. He believes tower seven collapsed at free. Fall speed because the fires. There's a lot of people that believe that. Unfortunately I'm not a fucking engineer. I would like to know whether or not it's possible to burn a building so bad inside that it does collapse like that. It's impossible. I don't know if that's true. None of it. All you have to do is talk to engineers and architects. I've talked to them. You could. You could. You could hear them. No, there's no architects that it outside of Nist, a government agents and there's no architects fighting for, uh, I'm trying to debunk the tower seven. There's none in every account. I don't know if that's true to you. I don't know if you know that, but there's got to be some architects and engineers that don't think that that building fell because it was demolished.

Speaker 3:          00:11:22       No. Well, if you understand how it, there's about 100,000 architects and engineers and the associations like the American Association of Architects in here. There's about a hundred thousand and Richard Gauge. He's one of them and he didn't know anything about. He thought it was a, it wasn't an inside job. It took him years and then he didn't really know about tower seven. Most of them don't know about power seven. What he does now, he discovered it and what he does now, we'll just go from convention to convention, sitting 15 architects down at a time and boom, about 99 percent of them. They all believe that. They didn't even know there was a third tower. It was not in the media that much. They basically ignored. It's crazy. I think by this time everybody knows about tower so they still don't know. Most people don't know, but they don't. You don't run on a mainstream media.

Speaker 3:          00:12:12       How could anybody. People have talked about it enough online to the point now more than ever, but still my now more than ever, yes. They go to hear about that tower seven thing, but they don't really know the details. They just kind of just know about it. You know? You ever see the video that shows the full collapse, which takes a lot longer. She the first collapsed. It was the top of the thing falls into the center and that's the elevations they explain architects and engineers. I've sat with them. I'm a structural engineer, but you tell them this is what if someone told you, if someone told you there's 85 columns that hold up tower shoving and if someone told you about structional engineer, told you, would you think he was crazy or would you believe him? If he said, and it makes sense. I mean it's common sense.

Speaker 3:          00:12:56       The only way you're going to get a building to come down like that, any building, any structure, is you have to blow up all 80 comps the same time. Otherwise they won't go down like that. To me, that's common sense to someone who believes that government agencies have said, no, that's not true. One column went and then it spiraled out of control because of fires. When you talk to structural engineers, I've had, I've had Richard Gauge on my podcast wife. Every time it comes back, he gets more. He just piles on more because all I gotta do is sit them down. They don't know. Nobody knows. That's the truth. CSE ever debated someone who's like an opposing viewpoint, but it will debate on structural. I know nobody's backing up. This is what he's teaching them would though, because when they look into it, it's common sense.

Speaker 3:          00:13:40       Anybody knows you got to, so you think that they know that it's not true. They think they think that power tower seven was an inside job and they don't want to debate it because they can't. When you really think they think that. I say that again, so you think that people that are debunking it, so like if, if he's got this opinion, there's no architects and engineers debunk it had already looked into that. That's already been, that's already been done. And set texts and engineers just disagree. Come on man. You don't think there's any people to find the video? Find a video of a real. I mean it's got a government agency, Jamie, see if you can that, but doesn't that make sense? What is sort of a, an engineer told you, uh, struck a dude who build skyscrapers told you to your face? Like I've been told to my face. They said the only way that, and you see it on video engineer after engineer, after engineer. Are they all crazy? The engineer, engineer after Ingenico? It's impossible when you look into it, it's impossible for a building to collapse like that unless all 80 columns are blown up at the same time we, we've covered this, but here's, it's common. I don't know anything about engineering. I don't know if you have diesel fires to get out of control. If it weakens the entire. Where it just collapses

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       like that, I don't know if you have, you have guests all the time that are experts in fields that you're not experts in, but when you sit here just find out sometimes they're wrong. Unfortunately. Sometimes they would ramble about some stuff and then they find out that they're making some of it up or this is some of it does happen, but as an engineer, a guy who builds, understand this, doesn't it make sense? Jamie? Does that make sense? Google, like try to figure out like who resists architects and engineers? Like what is it written down? I'm reading right now an article from the Boston Globe that talks about truth is nine slash 11 and Richard Gauges talked about and I think they they're going to hold on that might have interviewed him in and I'm trying to figure out what this is, what they're talking about. There's got to be some artists that have had a conversation or a debate with someone who believes in you couldn't possibly have fallen any other way.

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       Maybe they're out there. Here's the thing. I don't know, Shit like I don't know how my fucking computer works. I don't know. How do you know anything that constructs. How do you know anything? A lot of Shit, you know a lot, but I know, but if somebody wanted to argue with me about the components and how they worked on a laptop, I would have to let go. Yes, you're probably right after to talk to some computer engineer who's going to tell me the actual reality of it. Build buildings. I've had a mom I'm sure, but I just can't believe that the people that build buildings think it's an inside job, so. Okay. What if we said, okay, what have been pretty impressive if 90 percent. That was pretty impressive. It was a 50 percent would be impressive. Exactly. Fifty percent would be impressed. It's about in the nineties.

Speaker 1:          00:16:25       I don't know if that's right. So I don't know where you getting that number. I'm getting it from Richard Gage, who's the head of architects and engineers was not 11 truth. They add another couple of understand but know. But he might be a little biased, right? I mean, if he's the head of architects and engineers from nine, 11 truth and he tells you that 90 percent of the architects and engineers out there think it's an inside job, it might be a little biased. I don't know if that's true and I don't think you do necessarily either. I think we're. We're just guessing. I believe it. I would love to see. I would love to see an architect or an engineer that disagreed with him, talked to him about it and go over the data because until that happens, I don't know what the fuck they're talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:17:03       No, nobody argues with them. Nobody does. That's got to be. There's got to be someone who debunks that guy. Everybody debunks. Everybody know they definitely a smear campaign. Are you kidding? But, but isn't a smear campaign or is it just that they're saying things that he's saying that aren't correct? Not just him. He's just. I understand it's common sense date maybe. Okay. It's just bright, but I don't know. I don't know anything about making buildings. I don't know anything about what it takes for a building to collapse. I don't know. Totally. I don't know either. Maybe it got hot. I believe not just hot, it's diesel tanks were in the basement. I want to believe that. I want to believe that it fires made it hot and I don't want to believe they blew it up because that's fucking scary. I wonder, want to believe the fire.

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       If a fire is in a basement and the fire has diesel fuel and it's burning it, some insane temperature in this fucking shit. Loads of diesel fuel down there. I wonder what effect that has. I don't know. Do you? Uh, I, I'm pretty sure based on my life's experience, that that's not going to bring down a building fuel life experience based on common sense. It's common sense that, yeah, for building the building's going to fall at free fall speed, boom. Like that. If a engineer after engineer after engineer at some point, I'm going to believe them at some point. I'm not going to understand it, but I don't. I don't know if you'd necessarily looked into engineers at disagree. I know there's a smear campaign. They're okay, but have you looked into the engineers? There's none. There's none, there's no doubt. There's no documentary, there's no documentary mentoring.

Speaker 3:          00:18:40       Find a documentary if they have to make a documentary for it to make sense. What was that? What if it's an article? What if it's a peer reviewed paper? What if it's some sort of. Those are all, dude, that's a smear campaign. There's that side. There's the elite that don't want this out. And then there's people trying to get the truth out. So the elite have the control of the media. So how are you going to. They have paid shills or you don't think you think that they dropped. They would have dropped the ball big time. Like earnest byner in 1987 for the browns. It would have dropped the ball if you're not, if you don't have paid shills online. Strategically pushing the agenda. Come on. Okay. Were we about to pull up? There's a bunch of fake shit on him. What? Jamie?

Speaker 4:          00:19:22       As I was stuck on this Richard Gauge thing that I was trying to debunk, see if anybody's debunking him. Uh, I'm looking at.

Speaker 3:          00:19:29       He's just a character.

Speaker 4:          00:19:33       I'm looking around. I'm just looking around. The Boston Globe article says that there's a small vocal subset of people of engineers that are with this Richard Gauge Guide read.

Speaker 3:          00:19:43       I've never read that. It was like some overwhelming number. Just keep. Keep stirring. It's. It's hard because it's fun. It's exciting. It's exciting to think that there's some sort of a gigantic ball of super geniuses that run the world and they decided to blow up tower seven. You know what's funny about the moon? Fucked ourselves. Jesus. Talk about the. You know, what's crazy about the moon? What is the hardest shit ever accomplished? The greatest by the human race. The greatest accomplishment was landing on the moon. Right? Right. So you would think, holy shit balls. I don't know what. Listen. Okay. Okay. But let's just at the time. At the time the Internet is the biggest. Okay. Okay. But I'm just talking about like a physical achievement. Three dudes, they got shot up in a rocket that were in a, like a orbiter and then the orbiter shot out the lunar, like the lamb, and then it lands. They played golf, Went Dune bug riding, did donuts in the sand. They get take pictures. They get back

Speaker 5:          00:20:47       in, take off dock with that orbiter and then fly back. That's the hardest she'd ever. No one died. Can you imagine? Can you imagine that second mission, six months later they did it again when when they had to break the news that they were going to use different astronauts because every mission they use different astronauts. Wouldn't you think they would like a show like have the same star over and over. The three dudes have pulled it off. Keep doing it. They do know. You're kidding. They did it before. Yeah, but they don't want to keep doing it. What the fuck you want me? What if. What if I got it? Thank God. What if they were planning on using buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong, but they just fucking got an ego shit. They started going to clubs and like they want to renegotiate their contract because they probably went to the moon for like, you know, $70,000.

Speaker 5:          00:21:39       You know what I mean? They've got that government check that go. We'll put you on the second album on the second it just like the record business. You know what I mean? My bachelor's now album, we make that much. Of course they say, listen, we'll get you on that second, on the second and third. Land means how much money you're gonna make you're gonna. Come back, you're gonna. Be famous. You can be fucking doing all sorts of press. Think about the bitches. Think about the coke. All that shit. They probably got blowed out and got too cocky and wanted to renegotiate. Oh my God. And then NASA said, we just got to go with some new dudes. They made $8 per diem. When Uncle Sam folks, you raw dog, he uses sand. Uncle Sam uses broken class on his dick. When you guys went to the moon, why wouldn't you think there was enough?

Speaker 5:          00:22:30       That dude in the middle, the dude in the middle, in the middle, didn't actually, was hovering in an orbiter. He was hovering in an orbiter and they landed some little piece of shit. A Lunar Lander would have the land and then they took and they show. The only time I ever, they got one shot of it taken off and whatever was filming it followed it all the way up, but who was the official story? There was a live remote controlled. That's what they said that they could control from for. From Houston, for sure. That works, dude. I couldn't get my phone to work on the moon. Landings are so God damn ridiculous. Oh fuck. There's video of them like just maybe a 100,000 feet in the air and they like filming it, making it look, you know, there are many emulating. What the fuck come on. That video stream. That's a damning. The explaining what they were doing. Well the video says that they're saying they're at 30,000 miles out. That's what they're saying. Something like that. Halfway to the moon, that would like a 125,000 miles away from Earth. So halfway halfway to and make it look like never far away. So you know, if they look out their window, that little circle or whatever shape, maybe it was a rectangle, whatever the window it, the entire earth fills up all the glass of course. Because you're like still.

Speaker 1:          00:24:02       Well it's. You got to remember they blocked out all the other windows. That was what was in damning about it. What's damning about it is that they've got this camera setup where they're filming the blackness of the interior of the cabin and the circular window and it's circular windows supposed to represent earth. This little slice of earth with clouds on it and shit and the blend that kind of stands still trying to create the. I don't know if that's real. See, I've looked at that a hundred times. It might've just been lucky. This is exactly what I think more than anything more more likely. It was just like, yeah, that's fake. And now that the watch, this is what you could see. You can see, oh this is just you gotta. You gotta go to the one where it shows the actual fake footage. This is the actual video is not going to show the full thing where they pull away and you see the guys manipulated the dampers and pulling the things off the wall. The new reveals what it reveals that they're in low earth orbit, that they're not really

Speaker 5:          00:24:55       just looking at Hawaii. It's like the little hole and they're focusing on a little island. Google Bart Sabril

Speaker 1:          00:25:01       is. I had A. I had dinner with this gentleman back in the day. He's very nice guy and he's the guy that wrote a funny thing happened on the way to the moon and he's absolutely convinced that they never went to the moon. He was a not a dumb guy. I had an interesting conversation with him. He's fully onboard and absolutely committed and not, not that they couldn't do it or that they, uh, they couldn't get the footage of it, but that they faked the whole thing. Like they never even did. Everyone went out there. Some people think that they couldn't film it. They went there but they couldn't film it. So these, this fake film of that. But that there was other ways to track whether or not they went there. There's some people that believe that, and then other people believe. No, no, no, no. It's all fake. It's all fake from the jump. They shot them into low earth orbit. They float around in low earth orbit and then drop back down.

Speaker 5:          00:25:45       I believe that. I believe it was. It's just a scam. They're just making money and they're. And they're showing. That was a distraction for the va from the Vietnam War. All six missions during Richard Nixon administration. They did one every six months with different astronauts. No one got hurt. No one died. Are you kidding me?

Speaker 1:          00:26:03       You ever see the video footage from the first man in space? The video footage, the first manned space is so entirely fake. It's fucking hilarious. Guy. Russia? No, the guy from Russia, the Russian guy, he did go into space, but they didn't have a fucking camera crew inside the capsule with them. There's like opposing lights and different like you could see like if there's a distance between the guy, but it's so fake. It's always been propaganda. Put up Google fake video footage of first man in orbit. What is it? What was the Russian cat's name? The first dude that went into orbit. But uh, they have a video footage of him inside his car.

Speaker 6:          00:26:45       Oh, leg room was all like tech was one of the first leg lock guys ever. Right. You had to watch your shit with him. He would sambo the shit out of your legs. Remember there was like a few leg locks back in the day. Just a few. Yep. No, you know, the craziest thing I found out I thought heel hooks for sure were legal and sambo and apparently they're not even legal and samba. Oh my God. They just do straight ankle locks and bars and it was because of the shoot and calf cranks. They all wear shoes and no heel hooks and samba. That's crazy. What do you think about shoes? She be allowed to wear shoes were either at fighting or in grappling. No, no. Yeah, I agree. I think gloves too, but then I'm a broken record with that. Did you find it video of just find fake video from Diane face tends to my work shoes. Fuck it. Problem is mma like kick you and that goes in your eye. What is this footage? No, no, no, no. This is the moon landing. So Soviet moon landing. Now, first man in orbit. Um, it's inside the cockpit. It's like a NASA faking a earth. NASA first man and, or regression. Not just put NASA faking or what was the guy's name?

Speaker 1:          00:28:05       Who was the first, uh, first man in orbit. What's near Gagarin. Okay, so go Yuri Gagarin a video. You could see the video. So he climbs into this thing. He takes off and then see if you can find the first person like staring at him.

Speaker 6:          00:28:25       There's a bunch of it where it's like, so clearly not really happening. It's all fake, man. They're all faking it. The Russians are faking it. They're all, they're all doing it together where there's no real cold war. But there was a, a, some sort of a

Speaker 1:          00:28:38       video on the analysis of that saying that there's light sources in there. There wouldn't be a light source inside that cabin that you'd be able to film with and how far away with the camera have to be to capture this and they had these big ass clunky cameras and it wasn't that kind of space.

Speaker 6:          00:28:52       Think about, think about TV and the movies when they were born. What were they ever about? Like what's really going on? You know, I dream of Jeannie was right away. It's right away. It's total bullshit right away from day one. It's never. There was never a show about what life really is. It was always bullshit right from the start, right from the Getgo, propaganda. They didn't create TV for entertainment. You kidding me? Oh, let's entertain them. CVC,

Speaker 1:          00:29:21       it's not like one super genius wants to create something called TV and then they use that tv to manipulate the world. What happens is one super genius figures out a way to take a visual image and projected into millions of different televisions at the same time. Who's paying this? Hold on a second because he's a technologist, so he figures out how to do it. They start things through this and then the powers that be realize what kind of manipulation you could get out of something like that where you could show the news every night and presidential addresses and then they started using it for their own good, but it wasn't created to control people's brains. It was created because people have this inherent desire to constantly innovate and make better and better shit. We don't even know why we do it, but we're fucking obsessed with it.

Speaker 1:          00:30:05       So these technologists, to create it, they. They're so far smarter than any of the people that use it and manipulate people. The people that created the ones that actually understand how to make a digital signal with your phone stream live and periscope and a guy who was in New Zealand can look at it in real time while you're talking about something would be a good idea for the Illuminati that seek people like that out and hire them. Wouldn't that be a good move? That's definitely a good hell yeah. You go after those dudes wearing a man, I think black male. Um Damn. You got them. Companies work directly with military and they get billy to military contracts to make all kinds of shit they always have, whether it's computer stuff, whether it's surveillance equipment, what I mean, there's lucrative contracts like that was the big thing about the Iraq war, right?

Speaker 1:          00:30:52       Like everybody was terrified of the fact that you had this guy who was the ceo of Halliburton, which is a company that cleans up after we blow shit up and that guy becomes the vice president and then they start getting these giant no bid contracts to clean shit up after we blow it up. Like the money involved in something like that is insane, right? You're talking just hundreds of millions of dollars just flowing like water, right? It's just constantly flowing. So if you think about that, you think about that. That's going to be the case with everything. If they have the kind of money to throw that way towards the Afghan war, what, what kind of black ops money do they have to make those jets unlimited? Those stills crazy. Fucking stealth. Generally as much trillions are constantly missing in the Pentagon at back in right before nine slash 11. It was two point 3 trillion missing from the Pentagon.

Speaker 1:          00:31:43       Literally a couple days before, but yeah, the day before Donald Rumsfeld, everyone knows about that, but like now I'm done. Now it's like, oh, 17 trillion are missing two, two point 3 trillion was bad. Where's all this money going? Exactly. Trillions. Trillions. Yeah. This is where it's at, but here's what you're saying is not crazy. Like people are listening to this. There's a lot of people that are listening to this that have never heard this before, and they think, well, this is crazy. These guys are just making shit up. This is some loony fucking left wing conspiracy theory. Yay. You guys think that the government was in on this and that it was all a scam to hide the fact that they'd stolen trillions of dollars, but they really did have a press conference and it's really available online and Donald Rumsfeld really does look straight at the camera and he really does say they're missing trillions of dollars. Two point 3 trillion, trillion trillion. That's a thousand billion and then the day

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       nine slash 11 hits a plane or a bomb blows up a small little section of the Pentagon where all the people that are auditing the Pentagon, the Accounting Office blows up and everyone coincidence, bro. It's a total coincidence that she could really happen. Listen to me, man. No one would ever kill someone for as little as two point $3,000,000,000,000. That's not enough money to get people to kill people. It's just not. People need more money to kill people. People kill people for like 50, except she gave so really shitty guy who would kill somebody for like a thousand dollars. Shit is so corrupt and it's always been listening to Donald Rumsfeld talk about this.

Speaker 3:          00:33:24       Oh, how dare you talk her over guy. See if he could find the actual video of him talking because it's pretty fascinating. It's just a couple minutes. Donald Rumsfeld. Yeah. That's a lot of money down. Whereas that carries a shitload of them. Where'd it go, son? Um, yeah. This is, that's not the full video of him actually saying it, but nine slash 11. Donald Rumsfeld, trillion guaranteed a bunch of no one ever talked about it again. That was great. The second one, boom. What's crazy is it really didn't get brought up after that. Let's listen to it on reinsurance.

Speaker 3:          00:34:03       Same time. $7,000,000,000,000 in transactions. Two point 3 trillion, 2000, one 10th of September ends according to some estimates. We cannot track two point $3,000,000,000,000 in transactions. Two point 3 trillion with a t. The very next day, according to the accounting offices were destroyed in the Pentagon to two point 3 trillion was never brought up again. Who's more gangster than that? They got they go, dude, we just got to say something because you could take the trillions, but we got to make. We got to admit it and then everyone's gonna. Forget about it. What did people say to that? That's one of the one, one of those ones where what does people. What do people say to the idea that the plane would hit the perfect spot to hide the two point three trillions of dollars in debt to for you, for someone to know, to admit to themselves, they'll say, everybody will admit the government is corrupt, but when something gets brought up, they're always believe in the government side.

Speaker 3:          00:35:07       You know what I'm saying? Yeah, but this one doesn't even have a side. Here's the thing. Still watched that and know that was fishy shit. Nine slash 11. I don't trust it and everything. Every now you got to look at nine slash 11. If you see that and you don't look at nine slash 11, what? Skeptical eyes there. You're hypnotized. Well, that alone is one of those Arsenio Hall segments. Things that make you go, hmm, come on man. Cool. You're going to trust. You know you're doing like if you were doing business with this organization and then you saw a speech by

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       the chairman of that organization and he just said, we're missing a $55,000,000,000. Would you still want a new business with this guy? Look at this one. Trillion's go missing from the military. Pentagon can account for six point 5 trillion in tax payer cash. Cash. No one can but. But everyone. The official story, I believe the official story that they wouldn't do that. They wouldn't do that. Yeah, they're are corrupt, but they wouldn't do that. Yeah, they're evil. Yeah, but they wouldn't do that. It's like it doesn't make any sense. The report review, look at this. They cannot provide adequate documentation for how it spent. Six point 5 trillion. That is hilarious. How do they, how do they not all go to jail? How nobody. Nobody's going to jail. You know, Illuminati. Nobody goes to jail. Your richest. Fuck I know, but this is into satanism. The people that go to people that have the money that our taxes go to, like they have it.

Speaker 1:          00:36:32       Our taxes, we spend the money or we buy, we get the money. We sent it to them. They have it. They can't account for six point 5 trillion. That's so much money. That's crazy. That's like he's in the national debt like 13 trillion or something. What's the national debt is higher. I might've made that up. Yeah, your trillion. What do you think it is? We think the national debt is to have no fucking I, it doesn't even matter. It doesn't matter what the data. $6,000,000,000,000 and nobody's going to jail. But what I'm saying is it's half of the, I think it might be like half a national debt. Nobody. Nobody in the Illuminati goes to the jail. That our national debt is 20 point 4 trillion, which we cannot pay, but we can't account for six point 5 trillion. Why even account for it anymore? Just at this point.

Speaker 1:          00:37:19       Just fucking. Just say, shut up. Fuck it. Let's just cross our fingers. Yeah. Well there was an article that was written about, uh, the idea that our country was going to descend slowly into something that's not on democracy anymore. And uh, the argument you would make if you don't have to account for trillions of dollars that you make us pay for the argument would be. That might have already happened. Like where it's all about money and control, right? What more money are you going to get then? Six and a half trillion dollars, like if it's really all just about money and control, that's a shitload of money and well, what's the control? The control is it's rarely discussed like there's all sorts of outrageous like transgender people using the women's room. Once you're in the Illuminati, you're above the motherfucking lot. Nobody's going to jail.

Speaker 1:          00:38:11       They're all fucking doing crazy shit. Nobody goes to jail. Nobody in the Pentagon's going to jail. Are you kidding me? No one in the CIA's going to jail. They're not going to jail. I understand, but what's crazy is that no one taught here a further mysteries. What happened to thousands of documents that should be on file but aren't the ige study found that F A. I don't know what that is. Did not document or or support why? The defense reporting system removed at least 16,500, 13 of one point 3 million records during quarter three. Fiscal year 2015 as a result of the data used to prepare the fiscal year 2015 egf. I don't know what that is. A third quarter and year end financial statements were unreliable and lacked and adequate audit trail. So they just started yanking transactions and deleting. I believe them. Oh, what else? Now, how does that work?

Speaker 1:          00:39:06       If they, if they have black ops, like what we're talking about before. So if they have like area 51, which is like groom lake, you know, that whole area in Nevada where it's illegal to even get close to where they were supposedly develop and stealth bombers and all that shit. They did all that stuff out there. Right? How much they get and how do they, how does that money work? Because that is that where all the money's going to crazy military projects. Like what does a black cop, you know what I'm saying? Like if they say black ops, right? Is that why they cannot account for that? I mean, isn't that makes sense? If they're spending trillions of dollars making these crazy fucking jets and it's missing. Yeah. But, but is that what it means? I wonder if that's what it means. I wonder if it means that this is just some shit they get to just do whatever the fuck they want with and they build these crazy bases and they do whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:39:53       Sonic jets, you know what I mean? Can you imagine the people at the top, like the islands they have and shit. Queue management pieces. They've got pieces of land that we know nothing about. Now what Janet budget has it like an area for classified programs. So they spent like $59 billion on classified programs. Oh, so the six point 5 trillion is on top of that. Yeah. Maybe classified programs is one level of top secret and it gets all the way down to where we deconstruct alien spacecrafts. That's like that Robert Lasar type shit. You ever see that guys videos? Yeah. We checked we were 15 years ago and um, I don't, I don't know where I am still fascinated. That guy's just a little tom because he's still alive. Yeah. Can you imagine him on this podcast? That would be free cash within the government. I think he's really cool.

Speaker 1:          00:40:44       You know what he's friends with John Lear and that guy says the most crazy, crazy sean. This is his secrets are that there's people, there's millions of people on Venus, there's millions of people on Mars there. There's people all over the on every planet and and they're just not telling us about that, but isn't John Lear like, do you think that it's possible? I'm just gonna throw this out there. Do you think it's possible that John Lear, who's like some soup, isn't he a super billionaire character? He was a former CIA pilot. He was in the CIA for many years. Once you're in the cio, he's in his but isn't any like some super wealthy businessman. I don't know how we're thinking about lear jets. Jets is like his father created lear jets, but is he a super wealthy businessman? He should be. I was thinking if I was one of those guys and I was bored, I might just be trolling

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       the fuck out of people telling them about people on Mars. That's what he's doing, what? He's doing it for fun and and they let him. They let him in the Illuminati. If he does that and he's like, fuck yeah, that was already in. He's probably like, what you can't deny is things like Bohemian Grove. Here's what you can tonight. Like I'm, I'm warm. I'm on the skeptical side of all conspiracy theories. I don't get me wrong out there. I'm not. I'm not going after anybody. I'm not trying to indict anybody. I feel like there's just too many people are hypnotized to really stop anything. You can't stop these trillions of dollars missing. How are you going to do that? Who's gonna? Who's gonna? Stop that. Here's like, it's, it's a man. Too many people are hypnotized. It's just, it's, it's hopeless sometimes, you know. Okay. What I'm saying is that what you see, these things that you can't deny and one of the things he can't deny as Bohemian Grove, Bohemian Grove is a place where these leaders and these bankers and he's elites of the world literally do get together and put it on fucking robes and they get in front of a giant stone owl and they have a like a ceremony and they burned some sticks.

Speaker 3:          00:42:39       They burn an effigy. It's like the, when Alex Jones was the first guy to find that like you, you can criticize Alex Jones all you want and a lot of it's deserved. He says a lot of crazy shit and he's a character and he gets big and theatrical and it's fun, but he's exposed some very real shit that's undeniable. And one of the things that's undeniable is that there really is a place called Bohemian Grove over. These guys really do get together and they'd get together and they put on robes and they worshiped this mole, the, our God. That's something that's been going on forever. That's where people thought Alex was a shield because he would say all this great nine slash 11 stuff, 9:11 stuff. And then he would say he would work into the world's run by Satanic pedophiles, you know? So then people go, okay, is this shell?

Speaker 3:          00:43:27       He's a shell. You know? It's like saying it's like John Lee or type shit. That's what it sounds like. And that's what it sounded like. A lot of people that go, he's a chef, he's talking about everyone's satanic and they're all pedophiles. He, he's, he's, he's, he's retarded. He's a shill. But uh, uh, what do, what do you know about the Chester Bennington? Bennington as suicide? Um, I know that he had a, done a bunch of interviews. We talked about being raped a bunch of times when I was young and how fucked up it was. I don't know anything other than that. Damn, I don't want to talk too much about his personal life. No, it's no personalized. This is all I'm saying was, was um, anytime a dude kills himself. He's got a bunch of kids. Yeah. But when you, when you talk about, you know, um, you know, Chris Cornell and him were best friends. Yeah. You know, the crystal themself on Chris's birthday right now, what? Chris Cornell and his wife, they have a foundation called the Chris and Vicky Foundation and it's all about helping,

Speaker 7:          00:44:32       um, uh, children that were molested and abused and a lot of them were like former pedophile, a child traffickers trafficky or however you'd say it. Um, and he was really, really into it. And this is this, this is the conspiracy theory. I don't know, this is the conspiracy. It's not with him. No, no man, this is, this is, this is, this is why shit is getting fucked up as it has something to do with that. There's, um, he was, the conspiracy theory is that he was involved in stopping, trying to, you know, Ashton Kutcher is trying to stop human trafficking and you know, how a Corey Feldman, he got an interview, he said the biggest problem in Hollywood is pedophilia. And then, and then there's been several people coming out and the dude from Lord of the rings, Elijah Wood, he says many times he goes, there's a big problem, there's an Hollywood and everywhere really Hollywood and, and, uh, Washington DC.

Speaker 7:          00:45:33       Do you know that a 800,000 to a million kids get kidnapped a year? Do you know that? Is that real? I don't know. Look it up. I don't know. Where'd you read that? I don't know. I mean I somewhere online, I don't know if it's true, but it didn't. Eight hundred to a million kids get kidnapped her. And you know what city? 800,000 to a million. Eight hundred thousand to a million and you know what? What? Where's the biggest city where? Washington DC. Really? Yeah. Look how many people are kidnapped. Oh my God. Two hundred and 3000 children are kidnapped each year by family members. 800,000 children are reported missing. Huge. 800,000 dollars a year for missing. How many of those were recovered? How many people are kidnapped each day in the US? How many children are missing in the United States? Click on that. How many children are missing in the United States?

Speaker 7:          00:46:22       According to the National Center for Missing and exploited children, roughly 800,000 children are reported missing each year. In the United States. That's roughly 2000 per day. Of those, there are 115 child. Stranger abduction cases each year, so 115 or abducted by children are abducted by strangers each year, which means the child was taken by an unknown person, so a lot of those. Most of those people that were abducted there are taken by family members, but it's still a shitload of people. Even if it was 200,000, even if it was 20,000 kids a year, get kidnapped, even if it was 20,000, isn't that fucking huge? If it's 121, it's huge. 20,000. Yeah. You know, and it Sandy Hook was 20 so and there's 800,000 to a million and people are all over that. There's, there's no one's all over it. Everyone's like, oh, that's what comes like. It's people are aware of it. That's almost nobody.

Speaker 7:          00:47:20       Nobody's aware of it, but so many statistics when it comes to like how many people die in car accidents and how many people are murdered, how many people die of cancer and how many people. There's a lot of statistics to follow them. You know when people are, you know, there has been over time, you know that there's been a few people that have been suicidal but like really, really murdered, but they would call it a recent ones that were connected to Hillary Clinton where people were like, is that. Explain that? What is that two of them do? Do you know the ones I'm talking about? James, this is, this isn't about Haiti, there's a Haiti thing going on. There's a Haiti and is just a new one.

Speaker 4:          00:47:53       Yeah. He was supposed to testify about the money and the Clinton Foundation. I mean that's what they said. I don't know if he's officially gonna testify about that, but the city was going to at least talk about it.

Speaker 7:          00:48:01       Yeah. There was two dudes that died in the same month during this 30 day period. And they said they got suicided. Yeah, they both killed. Killed themselves. They both to testify. So who knows? Maybe they were really depressed and maybe maybe. Here you go. Our former Haiti government officials shoots himself in the head in Miami Area Hotel. My God. Come on. Yeah, here and what, what, what, what was he doing? He was getting ready to testify. So was there another one? Find another one. There was another one that was really recent. It was in the same. Was that July that you just looked down the other one? The other one was a girl. It was a female. Was it? Yeah, she was at part of the investigation. Ends up suiciding herself like an episode of the fucking house of cards. Man, isn't that crazy? So obviously who knows, maybe that were really depressed and they wanted to shoot their brains out.

Speaker 7:          00:48:49       Maybe we don't know. We don't know, but I'm saying there's some fishy shit going on there. Right? Here's the fish. Here's the thing, for sure. Someone that works for the government has had someone killed, right? For sure. Let's just go. Even Johnson was about to be indicted for two murders before jfk got murdered, but let's start from the beginning. It was that true? Yes. I believe that. Yeah. And then let's start for somebody who becomes president. Boom. It's gone. Let's start from the beginning for sure. Someone, whether it was Nixon or whether it was Theodore Roosevelt or Kennedy, someone at some point in time wanted someone dead. Yeah. And they did it and then pulled it off and the best way to do it's called a suicide. Right? And make it look not like a suicide because then you're sending a message. They do it on purpose.

Speaker 7:          00:49:36       Here's the question. If we all agree and I think every reasonable person would agree that somewhere in government somewhere, at some point in time someone has ordered someone killed and got away with it. Right? So that's what I'm saying. Not so then the question is how many other times? Yeah. How often did you find that chick who recently got got a suicidal, but hold on Eddie. Here's the thing. You've got to think of military strikes, right? If you're willing to authorize a military strike, you get to the point where you're willing to say, okay, do it like especially a drone strike. How about that? Like this is the building, the apartment building. We're 97 percent sure he's in the building. Do we have the authorization like how many civilians are dealing with somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 to 100? Okay. Yeah, my authorization and they do it and they launched that. Anytime you do that, if you can do that, if you can press that button and just wipe out 100 people, including the guy. Anytime

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       you can do that. Well, you just killed 100 people that didn't do anything wrong. Now, how easy is it going to be to kill some people that you think do a little bit wrong or annoying or keep fucking with you or like, you know, the Michael Hastings story, you know that story, don't you? Which ones that. Michael Hastings, did he get circumcised? He was a journalist. He commit suicide. Michael Hastings was a journalist who wrote for the rolling stone and he followed around a general and he got stuck over there. There was something happened. I think it was that volcano that went off, wasn't it? Were they limited air travel for like a month? Anyway, he got stuck over there while the volcanoes, they couldn't fly into this shit because if the sky was hazy around this area, um, so he stuck around and they, you know, they got a little loose with them, they joking around about stuff and he was making jokes about Obama and the rolling stone reported it and he wound up getting retired.

Speaker 1:          00:51:23       He retired and stepped down. He had to sort of step down because he was in insane. And after he did that, like everybody was furious since this report, he got a shitload of death threats because this guy was a serious general and he really knew his shit and he was well respected amongst its troops and he had a step down and he had it put those people in danger because this guy had an inside track to these people and they got a little comfortable around him and they took this one part and put it in. This article made this big story about it. Well, he wound up driving his car into a tree like 120 miles an hour. I went and pulled that out of the car, explode. It's new cars, new cars. Apparently they can take over the car. The car exploded and the engine was launched from the vehicle, like the engine blew up and was on the.

Speaker 1:          00:52:11       I forget how far away it was from the car. Fishy, right? Oh, so crazy fishing. But who knows? They said this is what the thing they said. They said, oh, well he had amphetamines in his system. Well, you know why he had amphetamines in a system? Because he's a fucking writer. Here's the dirty secret about writers. They're all on adderall. You guys a shit ton of. I'm on adderall. Like if someone's a writer and you've got deadlines, you've got to be like alert. It's way too easy. I have a good friend who told me that almost all journalists and writers are taking this stuff when they need it. Is that helps, right? It helps. It absolutely helps put. So there's the crash and there's the engine. If fucking launched a block away and they think that the conspiracy theory is that they drove him, not only drove him into a tree, would they set a bomb in his car and that it, um, it slammed in the bomb, exploded in the engine launch. Look how far away the engineers look at the engine, the upper right hand corner. There's the car and they'll look at the engine way up there. It launched. The whole thing is crazy. So what my point was, let me finish. He fucked up his. Even if the conspiracy theory that every now and then

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       politician, someone in power, even maybe an entertainer has someone suicided because they're in the elite, they got all the connections and they can get away with it. Um, even if that's not true, and that's all bullshit. And, and every suicide generally as a suicide, even though it looks weird and then they make it look like when you, when you watched that movie that, uh, the documentary, the Clinton chronicles on Youtube and you watch that man, man, they, they make it look obvious to send a message like, listen, we got the corner in our pocket. You don't want to fuck with us. We can make anything happen and no one's going to jail. That's what that is. But that's the conspiracy theory. But if it's not a real, damn, that's a good idea. You know what I mean? Run with that shit. That's a great idea.

Speaker 5:          00:54:14       If you're, if you're corrupt and you want to hold onto your power and you want to climb up as high as you can in the political world, that's a great idea, right on the corner. Go after the corner, whoever the, wherever you're where you're a mayor, what we go after the corner. You got to own them and then there's evidence that you look at stuff, certain cases, and it's obvious for certain cases they fly in the corner, they fly in. It's, it's so shady, but why wouldn't it be and why wouldn't you believe it will, you know what do you want the best one to Enron whistleblower who shot himself in the head. He shot himself in the head. Exactly. They do that on purpose. That's an obvious one. If you were a detective, would you enter a case like that? Go, listen, someone got suicided but it looks fishy.

Speaker 5:          00:55:01       Would you say, Nah, I'd suicide. Don't disrespect the family. Just keep it a suicide. They told us it was. No, you would want to know what the fuck really happened. Like if one of like one of your relatives died or whatever, and they said she committed suicide and you're like, fuck. But then someone you know that knows him, said it wasn't suicide brow it wouldn't you want to know the details or would you say it wasn't suicide? That's what the COP said. You know, what we should have respect for their soul and their family. We just say that. Or would you say, tell me what the fuck happened. What do you know? Right, right. That's natural. If it's her family fuck out. So when it comes to stuff like, um, uh, uh, you look at Chris Cornell, him and his wife had a foundation. Him and Chester, we're best friends.

Speaker 5:          00:55:44       The conspiracy theory, I don't know if it's true, but that we're gonna be found out some shit. They found out some shifts. Let's be respectful. No, we don't. We don't know. I don't know. I'm not naming any names, but you got to look into it. But it's. This guy just died, man. I just don't think this is shit. Do it on. It's, that's why you should speculate it when you find out the connection and the way they died it, they made it. Chris Cornell had nine broken ribs and a gash in the back of his head and hung them. Yes, and they said the official story is from the CPR, the CPR. He was already dead when they got there and they break nine ribs, don't CPI, and there's a gash behind his head behind his head

Speaker 7:          00:56:24       when they cut them loose and he bangs his head off the ground and he's hanging. He's hanging off a like one of those exercise. Someone killed him. When? When? When you look at the evidence, you're like, Holy Shit. He looked like he was murdered. And then chester right before chester dies the same way, the exact same way. Let's not do this man. I don't want to even do this. Alright, okay. I'm just looking into. Because I love Chester. I love Chester. I Love Lincoln Park, Lincoln Park, Lincoln Park. I don't understand the theories involved in this guy's death, especially when he just died. It just seems so disrespectful. And I. He was one of my favorite singers of all time stand. But if you really did just kill himself, like it seems so disrespectful to speculate that he was murdered because of some conspiracy theory. I don't know what the case is, but I don't even want to talk about it.

Speaker 7:          00:57:16       But do you know what I'm saying? That you know what I said enough. I don't need to say no more. I don't want to get into trouble, but I'm just okay. I'm not trying to put anybody in jail. I'm just. I Love Lincoln Park. I love Chester. I love Chris Cornell. You can understand. I understand. I just feel like you should really know what the fuck are you talking about when you talk about people. We were just talking about suicides. We were just talking about. We were just talking about is when you look at what they were into, they were into that. They were into fighting that. Okay. And when you look at exactly how also severely depressed, there was also a lot of psychological shit going on. Yeah. I don't know man. I don't know why people kill themselves, period, you know? I don't know why, but wouldn't you want to do serious?

Speaker 7:          00:57:58       There was some fish. Maybe I'll look into it. Talk about it until whatever the fuck reality has been that we were talking about. We're talking about all these crazy suicides. We're talking about our that and then this is insane. This is time. This is when you should bring it up. Have not later when everyone forgets about know any facts, so when you're bringing it. I'm just telling you. Sounds crazy. Okay. Alright. I get it. I get it. He was probably. He was. He probably did it himself. He could have very well easily have done it himself and the whole thing is just connecting them to some conspiracy without like a d because I care about it because I care about a deep understanding of the. I care about. I care about them. You don't know how, how much, how deep. My understanding is. I believe you.

Speaker 7:          00:58:47       Dude. You don't know how deep my understanding is. You have to assume that just make this happened. No, but I've looked into it. What I assume you don't know who was trying to kill them. I assume you weren't there. I assume that you don't know it as a fact. I was. Trust me that I looked into it and you wear the shoe you have, man. I sure you have. I just, it just me personally, I feel very sensitive about that stuff. I get. No, I get it. I totally get it. Let's change the subject. Let's get into the UFC. Okay. Damien Maia, can we turn the tie? Rod Woodley, Tyron, tyron tie rod, Tyron, Tyron, tyron Woodley. Yeah. That

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       people thought that was a boring match, but for me there were tremendous data in mma. The fact like Damon goes down to one 70, one 70 takes everybody down. He's taking college wrestlers down left and right, but could he take down tyronn? I thought I probably. I thought that was that he was gonna hit a wall there and he did. How are you going to take that? Do down. It's going to be very, very hard to take him down, so we learned. What I learned from that is, man, you got to get really good at shooting and doing what Paul was an expert. Paul says, is the best ever I've ever seen an MMA at making, pulling guard option one, you just made it like not option three. I was talking about the third option. I would want my fighter to have the best standup possible, the best takedowns possible.

Speaker 3:          01:00:10       Get on top, grounded pound and submit them. Beat them on the feet of your beat, on beating them, but if you're getting beat on the feet and you can't take the guy down, you better know how to pull guard you gotta. You gotta know how to drag dudes down, unorthodox ways, not just the regular wrestling. Why? Because you're going to hit tie Rod Woodley, you gotta throw some flying in an artist on him. You got to shoot deep enough just to get a slight clench and have something you're going to jump on. Not with you, not continue with the traditional wrestling. You gotta shoot pool, half guard, just like Andre Galvao did he when he fought mma a few times, that's all he did is shoot. Dude, sprawled. You just pulled half guard below me. Got Up double under hooks, got the bag. You got to get creative the way Nogueira be 10 Sylvia, way back in the day.

Speaker 3:          01:00:50       Ten Sylvia could not get taken down. It's too tall, Yada awesome. Reach. Nogueira was getting clipped. It couldn't take down. Tim. Sylvia, what did he do? He shot the best he could. And when Tim Silvia countered, he pulled half guard. He ended up in, in, in, uh, in Deepak and boom with the momentum, got up, swept him. So it was an indirect, unorthodox take is what happened. If you shoot pool guard and then sweep, that's the take down. You end up in the same place. So he went around the, the, the, the wall, and he ended up guillotine him put a guillotine from the top. You got to have that. You got to. And you know when he was pulling guard before Damien, Maia did pull guard before, early in his career and he just wasn't having it and he didn't. That wasn't an option. Tyrons takedown defense.

Speaker 3:          01:01:37       That was, that was the take down defense. Yes. That was the last option. But this is not, I'm not talking about traditional takedowns. I'm talking about the art of watch Paul Sas. He would totally, there's a time you can't just sit on your butt and I think after talking to take with a guy like tyron woodley is, you're going to have to get a wrestler who's like an elite high caliber wrestler that's going to be able to figure out how to take him down. I don't think like a regular dude like Damien Maia who's not a regular dudes, a world class grappler, but just here. Dominick Cruz is criticism of his, uh, his takedown temps that he wasn't following through enough and what he was saying technically was wrong. Yeah. You know, I think that if it was a real world class grappler for a real, you know, top of the

Speaker 1:          01:02:19       food chain, amateur wrestling had one taken everybody down. He is like the best wrestler. What he said about the fence, because most of Damien Maia take downs, a lot of them anyways are against the fence. He's really good at going double under hooks and doing some inside trips or outside trips. Tyron, defendant, all that shit. But you know, what else tyron did? He clipped him with a huge uppercut and the very first exchange, the very first time Damien tried to close the distance, tyron hit him with a vicious uppercut and he fucked his left eye up. Damien's left. I was fucked up from the very first exchange, the Damien shot low tire and hit him with a heart uppercut and just as his, I immediately swell up and it was fucked for the rest of the fight. So I think that that played a factor too.

Speaker 1:          01:03:02       Just tyrons game plan was in a lot of people's eyes, wasn't fun to watch. That was the problem and like Dana felt like he should have finished them. And tyron his thought was, look, this is this guy's. It's his goal is to win the title. You've got to come and try to beat me. And when the title, if I'm beating you, why? Why don't I just keep doing what I'm doing and continue winning the fight. You can't do anything, but if I changed tactics and make myself more vulnerable. And he said he did get hit by a lefthand or a couple left hands and that the stunned them. I guess his attitude was, look, if this guy wants to win that title, he's gotTa come and get it and it becomes get it. I'm going to knock him the fuck out and if he doesn't come and get it, why would I?

Speaker 1:          01:03:42       Why would I go after him and put myself out of position? I would coach Woodley the exact same lane. I would be yelling from the corner. Just keep doing what you're doing. Don't one fucked up exchange, gets a shot in and take some trips. Him. He tries to get up on his knees, jumps on his back, and that little scramble. One little scramble like that. Boom, you just fucked your whole shit up. Damien is not the best punch her in the world, but he's not the worst either. He can fuck you up if you. If you make a mistake and if you rush in and maybe he's reserved more energy than you think he has and he fires a very fast rate lefthand and catches you on the chin. He could fuck you up. He can fuck anybody up. He's not incompetent on the feet.

Speaker 1:          01:04:20       He's just not at the same level as tyron. He doesn't have the same movement. It's tire. Do you think Damien should would have. Damien had kicks a more like maybe not exactly like, but more in the vein of Edson Barboza Rodriguez. Wouldn't that be a whole nother dimension? Blake doesn't even have to be like that. How about just like Pedro his Oh, just attack the legs. Just make, make the legs. He's not doing that right now. Very little boxing. Well, dominick brought it up one time during the broadcast because he's like, I want to see Damien throw high kick, a left high kick. I go, yeah, but I go, have you ever seen Damian throw a left high kick? And he's like, I don't know. I'm like, I don't know either. I don't know if he's ever done it. I'm not, I'm not disagreeing with you, but I'm saying I don't think I've ever seen him try it.

Speaker 1:          01:05:02       Like he doesn't. I think he's such a specialist and his specialty is just get you to the ground strangling. He should spend grounds. I would suggest. I don't know. I ain't shit, but I would like to see Damien Maia with some with a adding to his arsenal, adding kicks, adding more whiteboards like why not for sure, but even if he did, the problem is it's like tyron is just so fucking strong and so good at stuff and takedowns any hits, so God damn hard. It's like you'd have to be like on him and you got to figure out how to actually get him to the ground, have full control of him and good luck with all that.

Speaker 5:          01:05:36       Remember Nogueira versus Mark Coleman? Yeah. That that Mark Coleman was planning on going to the ground with a Nogueira at all. This was at the height of pride. Mark Coleman's plan was to box with him, use his wrestling to not go to the ground. That was the plan the whole way through. I'm going to box this Nogueira guy. He's got an amazing guard, amazing Jujitsu, and he ain't going to take me down. I fucking wrestled the Columbus. What happened? Didn't know Garrett. Take them down. Fuck no, he didn't know what he did. He's like, people who can throw high kicks in, a lot of head kicks usually don't because they're afraid of going to the ground. All the guys that could do that, but guys that want to be on the ground and don't mind being on their back and are dangerous off the back and are known for having a dangerous guard like Nogueira. They could throw all the high kicks they want and that's exactly what know Kara did. He started throwing high kicks whizzing by, Mr Coleman's had and then one just barely nipped his forehead. So Mark Coleman just snapped into wrestling, said, fuck these baseball bats. I'm going to ground and pound this motherfucker. Take my chances in his garden. He took him down. He got triangle.

Speaker 1:          01:06:45       Yeah. That was the glory days of Jujitsu. Heavyweight champion. It was a triangle arm bar. And that you were out to exactly how I felt back then. Yeah, that's how we got to fight to the ground. It's by throwing head kicks and scaring the motherfucker wrestling. You know, cowboy. He used to do that a lot. Cowboy has a nasty guard and one of the reasons why guard is, I mean one of the reasons why so loose with his kicks, because he doesn't mind if you take them down, if you take them down, he tie shit up quick. Yeah, exactly. That's what they need. Mondelez throw his head kicks head kicks all the time because he hits guard is super dangerous. His gardens to jump in his garden, there's like 40 slash 50 percent chance you're going to tap. Yeah. His gardens saying yeah, he just a.

Speaker 5:          01:07:31       He did an Ebi maybe like eight months ago. He pulled off some beautiful rubber guard man. He looked like a fucking Ninja.

Speaker 1:          01:07:40       Yeah, he's a bad motherfucker and he's a bad motherfucker. He's got a crazy athletic frame too, you know, he's like, he's. He's built like this gigantic superhero type character. He's a cute dude. Built like a big small dude and he's all handsome and shit. He's right up there with Alan jobe. Beautiful Man. He's right there. I would put them right there, but don't you think like when you look at his proportions and the way he moves, he's almost like a, you know, a lot of big guys. Like they look like big guys. You know what I'm saying? Like a, like a perfect example would be like that. Do that just submitted Travis Browne. Was it only neck? Is that how you say it? The guy that got that done just submitted. Travis Brockie. No, choke off his bass off his back. That guy, he just be transparent. Did He, what?

Speaker 1:          01:08:25       Did he get them in arm? Trying to get them in like a rear naked choke on the side. Oh, that's right. He does crazy. His squeeze must be insane. Oh, he's probably just known in this gym is like did he's going to help get a hold of your neck and just smash it to. He's a, he's a spooky good grappler. You'd see like when he gets a hold of guys that he's putting like a crusher squeeze on for the people don't understand what he did. He let a guy mount him and he choked the guy while the guy was on top of them. That is insane and unheard of. He was mounted who was mounted, which means it's one of the worst positions you could ever be in an mma. The guys on top of you, he's his hips are above your hips. He's pinning you to the ground and this guy choked the guy from the bottom.

Speaker 1:          01:09:06       It never happens. It never happens. The fact that he could do it, I mean, here we can see it here. What, what, how do you spell, how do you say his name is? Wassily. Alexi. Alexi, Alexi Olynyk. So he's just ragdoll and travis here and he gets his back and look at this. He's got a rear naked on the side with a body scissors. Look how he's squeezing the body and just smush them so he can't breathe. He's got them in a locked down. Across the body. Yeah. And then he gets the neck and he's under inac. Just sort of like a sideways rear naked choke. The other one he did is even crazier when you see him submit. The guy from the bottom with a mesial choke. See that kind of guy that looks like a big guy. You know what it looks like? A big guy.

Speaker 1:          01:09:48       Vinny Magallanes looks like a welterweight. That's six foot three for some strange reason. Two hundred and 30 pounds. Is He fighting MMA anymore? They just going to do Jujitsu. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. He's going to come back and do the absolute Ebi absolutes going to be a at on it. This shit. Look at this shit. This is crazy. Who fucked does that? Watch them do that again. That's ever done that back that up again. People are going to try it now. So going all the way to the beginning so the guy gets mount and he. He thinks he's got to go. I got them out here and he just sinks this in and look how tidy makes this choke into the. Into the throat. We're crazy, dude. That seems legit. Fuck yeah, it's legit. It's 100 percent legit, I think. I think that's super legit.

Speaker 1:          01:10:33       Yeah. If you look at the way the arms are folding up here, I mean, that's not a goon, right? That's a front naked truck yet is that is. Um, it's all like real leverage. You know, how you could tell if a guy goon somebody just crushing their head. That's not a good squeeze right there. Yeah. And it's, it's fitting in like a like keys, right? Yeah. It's fitting in there perfectly. Your squeeze has to be super high level to get it to choke someone while being mounted. Oh good Lord. Good Lord. How many people have that? See, this tyron woodley thing is very tricky because in my mind, like I see that he wanted to win the fight period. That is the best way to win the fight. If this guy is only offering a certain amount of offense and you could stuff that offense and land your shots and continue to pile up points, which he did and don't ever put yourself at risk.

Speaker 1:          01:11:23       I get it. But I also get the Dana white point of view where he's like, you got to sell tickets. Like people are paying to see you fight. And if people are holding up cell phones and swinging them through the rafters, you know, because everybody's bored because they don't want to watch it anymore. And his, his thought is like, you got to sell tickets. Hey, who's the greatest take down artists in UFC history? George St Pierre to her same po versus Woodley. Yeah, but Woodley apparently because of this fight, they're talking about GSP versus bisping. Oh, they got to go to woodland. Come on. That's the only guy. If GSP just take woodley down, nobody can. But what if they just tried to take each other down, back and forth and everybody went crazy again. Took him down repeatedly. If he didn't like he would, that'd be great too.

Speaker 1:          01:12:06       But what if he did? Either way, I want to see the fight because. Because, because Woodley has a style. Some people don't like it, some people like it, some people appreciate it or whatever. But the only guy that has a shot to beat Woodley, the only guy would be the best takedown, best mma takedown artists of all time. He has like a million takedowns in the UFC. He's the only guy that would be able to. If GSP can do it, no one can. He's also very good striker. I think kicks. This is what you'd have GSP saying. You got to go to the pro wrestling angle. You know, I am tired of sitting at home watching boring fights as bad gsp impression on him saying like, enough already. I want my sound. It sound like Arnold. Kenny made ivs. Um, I don't know. Bisping's at one 95.

Speaker 1:          01:12:59       That's kind of weird. Is he saying, man, it's going to be too hard to make one 70 without the ivs. I think he was willing to fight either fight. I think he was willing to do one 70 or one add woodley. GSP would be huge. That would. That would be the biggest fight for. I'm not impressed with because who else is there at one 70 that has a chance of taking him down. Well, Robbie lawler, since he just won, you would have to look at Robbie's contenders, so he would just brawl with him. He's willing to brawl with them if you can avoid the big bomb, but he got hit with in the first fight, you know, and you gotta think Robbie lawler is coming off of five round war with Rory Macdonald, five round war with Carlos Condit, war with Johny Hendricks war war, war, war. It's all war.

Speaker 1:          01:13:45       Every fight. He's in his war. So like I think the him having a year off was giant and then he fought cowboy and towards the end he was coming after cowboy. He was hurting cowboy to the body. He hit Cabo with some big shots. I felt like a lot of people disagree with that decision, but I felt like I give Robbie the first round because he jumped all over cowboy in the beginning it was, I think it was enough to win the round, although I think Cabo is getting the better of the exchanges, the NFL silting the volume of and, and the impact when to Robbie second round when to cowboy. Pretty big. But then Robbie rallied and the third round and I think he dominated the third round and I think you hurt cowboy a few times. I think that would have been an amazing five round fight.

Speaker 1:          01:14:25       That would have been an incredible. Remember who won the fight? Robbie? One very close decision. I think it was a split decision. I don't know. My grade five bring a scrambled. It was a great fight. It was a great fight. Both gave. Both took. It was, it was war. It was chaos, you know, and in cowboy definitely caught them with some clean shots. He hit him some real good. Nice. The body as well. Cowboy landed a lot of great shit. But you know, Robbie looked like Robbie again. He looked like the Robbie lawler that won the title. It looks like a killer. He looked like the same spooky dude that just keeps coming after you until he puts you away. That's what he looked like in the third round. Third round, particular really looked like he was falling back into the old groove again. So there's him.

Speaker 1:          01:15:03       You know, man, it's crazy. Seeing Rory Macdonald over in beltour looking better than ever, looking better than ever. When he took down Paul daily, like he, he cracked Paul on the feet, didn't get hit with shit. Took Paul down and strangled the shit out of him. And the way he did it, you watch it, you go, whoa. Like Rory Macdonald might be the best welterweight on the planet. Like he might, he might write, be there, you know, you've got to remember he beat Tyron Woodley. Remember that fight? I don't remember. Roy. Shut him down. Shut down that big overhand right compressed against the cage. Not that long ago. Maybe if I had a gas. Two Thousand 15. I think he fought tyron woodley before he fought Robbie lawler. I think it was one of those elimination was that was a decision. Yeah, it'd be really by decision and the also be Damien Maia and he survived being mounted by Damien mine in the first round.

Speaker 1:          01:15:51       Damien took him down mouth to them. He defended and then he fucked Damien up and the second and third rounds and he's still peaking duties like 26. He's one of the best in the world. Without a doubt. He might be the best without a doubt. Yeah. It bums me out seeing him over at Bella Tor. I think that kid is sensational. Is Kelvin coming back down to one 70? What do you think? I think he can make it for sure. I think if Calvin had the kind of discipline that Chris Weidman has to get down to 85. Chris Weidman's a huge guy. He has to have real discipline to make that 185 pound limit. I mean he has to really watch his calories because you walk around it. I would like to know it's well north of 200 pounds, so he's a big guy, you know, according to Ray Longo, Matt Serra that like Chris is on the big side of 85, like he could easily be on the small side of 205, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:16:37       And then do you, what do you think about these new weight class? It was like the athletic commissions. Now they're, they're going to add 65, 75, 95 and I think to 20 to 25 to the UFC going to do this. I don't know if the use is going to do it, but I think they should. I think they should go every 10 pounds. Not every five pounds, but every 10 pounds like it the way it is. Do you feel like it just. It makes sense every. It makes sense, but they don't need to or something. I don't think we need it. It makes sense. I don't mind the big jumps really find your spot. We don't need more. It'll just be. It'll just. I don't know. At this point, I think you keep it the way it is, but who knows what they're going to do?

Speaker 1:          01:17:15       I don't agree. I think we need more weight classes. I think there's two big jumps. I think the jump of like one 85 to two. Oh five. It's fucking crazy. As a 20 pound jump. That's huge. The difference between a guy who's 85 and the guy was two, oh, five is significant. The amount of power that guy has over the 85 pounders. Fucking huge. Trying to spot 55. It's too many. There's too many tweeners like Diego Sanchez. Diego Sanchez is probably a 65 or you know, maybe a little too small for 70. Maybe too big for 55. I think there's a few of those guys. He's gotten down to 45. I know. Not good though. I mean not. Not fought like to Diego Sanchez of old. I don't know. I think it should sustain them. It's 55 is spot. Yeah. I think it's hard for him to even make that though.

Speaker 1:          01:17:56       If you could let them fight at 65, he'd have all his energy. It makes sense what you're saying. Like get. It totally makes sense. But the fighting, it's just fighting, you know, let's not diluted we got enough. We need more. We don't have everything. Doesn't have to be like just all systematically. Fair. You know, just think that's the case. I don't think we have enough. I think we get a room for more champions. I think we'd have more super fights. We'd have more guys rise to the top of the division and it will be easier to match them up. It's way easier to match up a 75 with an 85 than it is to match up a 70 with an 85 or 55 with an 85. It's just like the gaps are too big. I think we have too much already. I think it's hard to keep track of shit the way it is.

Speaker 1:          01:18:35       Maybe there's an argument for that, I guess. I don't know. I like it though. I think it gives people more options. I think heavyweights, for sure. It gives them more options. I would also like to see a super heavyweight division. I would like to see a full on freak show. I want to see the mountain from game of thrones. I want to see that guy learn how to fight. He's like 330 fucking pounds. You know that guy that picks up those stone balls and shit. Do you know what I'm talking about? Carries cars. He's one of those dudes. How big is he, John? Yeah. How tall is he? Six. Eight. Something like that. Yeah. Viking, straight viking long hair. Beard. No. He's got a beard. He's like one of those Iceland guys, I think Sweden or Iceland. One of them. One of them Viking characters. How big is that mountain dude? There's a video of him sparring with conor Mcgregor. It's hilarious. He's six foot nine. Jesus Christ. What in the fuck is that? Is there a picture of him? Jesus Christ, he weighs 300. Eighty pounds. Three hundred 86 with him picking up cars. Oh yeah, there's, there's, there's a bunch of videos of him doing shit here. Watch him. That's him. See if they have some videos of him doing his workouts. His workouts are fucking insane or in in some sort of strong man competition. Do you ever see. Go back. Go back to the screen you just had. See, scroll down to that conor mcgregor video. The screen you just had.

Speaker 1:          01:19:53       That's it right there. See conor mcgregor versus the mountain and cottage playing around with them. Sparring with a look at the size of this guy and counties like slapping him in the stomach.

Speaker 6:          01:20:10       He's like, come on, I'm going to grab you think he's trying to grab him. Oh, look at this. He's like, come on man. High Five. Yeah, he's getting tired. He's getting tired. Damn. Kind of wanted to keep going. He's pulling him in the stomach. Got a mad mad. This is real now. Yeah. Yeah. It's getting real. How old is this? It's pretty recent. Like before he fought Aldo. Damn. Look at this guy. He's just kidding. I do with straight left face. He's mad. He's mad. Dude. This is why conor mcgregor is such a bad motherfucker. He's so. He's so crazy. Like legitimately crazy. They just like Bruce Lee. He's just popping that guy in the stomach with those straight left and you don't like it and he knows that dude's getting tired. He threw his kicks dude. Like he's pinning his leg together inside his crotch and just getting them to old. Just pick up connor if you wanted to jump in front. Kicked him in the body. Oh Shit. He's just teeing off on him. I need to move. And the dude's got hired. He's so big a side kick him right now. It just keeps popping and with that straight left, look at that. This is crazy because this goes for a few minutes back and guarantee that dude is not doing a whole lot.

Speaker 6:          01:21:51       He's getting tired, man. Look at him. He's backing up. Big giant. Six foot. What? What does a six, nine, six, nine, three, 86.

Speaker 8:          01:22:02       He's getting tired.

Speaker 6:          01:22:04       He's trying to grab them. Nope. Nope, not today, sir. He's laughing. His father said. He's like, dude, he was like a Bruce Lee laugh. Yeah. Okay. This is real. So you look at it over and over again. It keep popping them with that straight left. It's funny, man. It's weird to watch, right? He tried to give him a high five to stop. His daughter said, ah, yeah. Okay. No. Oh, tagged him. He's throwing. Yeah. This is not into that. Nothing to that. Oh Dude. Yeah. He doesn't get that. He doesn't like it. Those are hard shots

Speaker 8:          01:22:50       he gave up.

Speaker 7:          01:23:04       Oh Wow. That was basically a real fight. That was a half a real fight. That was like a half a real fight. Right. That looked like a real fight to me. Didn't they? Didn't punch to the face. I don't think he wanted a punch to the face. It would have been a bad move. Yeah. Just stick to the body. You can't even reach his face. Yeah. You're not going to hit that face. Look at what he does. He throws a Kettlebell over the top of the fucking do. What if it landed on his head? Um, you gotta watch the, a youtube channel or the weather? The instagram page. Is it instagram? No. Twitter. Jesus Christ. Twitter page. Hold my beer. Have you ever seen the twitter page? Hold my beer. No. Maybe Jude. It's. Is it perhaps the greatest twitter page that's ever existed and it's hold my beer while I do this and they do some stupid shit over and over again. What does this hold my beer while I. Oh, that's a good one. He opened up a beer with a, a football, but that's not. Scroll down a little bit. Let me show you my, some ridiculous ones. You find the right one.

Speaker 7:          01:24:13       There's a ton of videos of one guy did a back flip. He tried to do a back flip off the top of these bricks. Oh, don't do this one. That one's horrible. Guys going to karate kick that girl in the head. I get this. Oh, be or why kicked this can off your head. Watch this guy hold my beer while I sit on an airbag. Watches. What does the hold my beer? Did they say that? No, no, no they don't. But um, what's this one is you got light and the guy on fire. Oh, Jesus Christ. The fuck is he doing? Oh, it's basically hold my beer while I fucking ridiculous Easter. Oh, we blew up. Oh Shit. Okay, scroll down. Scroll down. Not that one. Keep going. Keep going. That one right there. This guy's pretty bad ass like that. He actually made it. Sometimes they may.

Speaker 7:          01:25:03       Yeah, but watch this one. It's good. Oh Shit. I guess try to do a back flip off a stack of bricks or something. Okay, that's enough. That's enough. But if anybody's interested, go to hold my beer on, on twitter. It's fucking late. I try to retweet them at least like once a month. He's fine. The most ridiculous shit. Who's instagram accounts? Oh yeah. Do you find fun? I think, uh, the beastmaster oh, you mean Derek Lewis? Derrick Lewis. The funny. He's hilarious. Follow him. Follow his instagram might be the best instagram I follow. Do you see the one where the dudes were trying to jump out of the way of some rolling. Hey, they got a bale of hay rolling down this hill and they do try to jump out of the way and got fucking launched into the air heats. I mean, he's the most gangster shit talkers in the UFC. I mean, he was more gangster than him. He's more gangster than Tito did. Mike Tyson, you know what I mean? Mike Tyson

Speaker 7:          01:26:04       said crazy shit. He said, uh, I'll eat your children eight the gentleman. And he said, um, I'll fuck you to you love me. But he said that before the fight, you know, you after the fight. He's not saying that. You know what I mean? He's not know when Derrick Lewis, when he called out Rhonda, that was fucked up. That's a low blow. That was a low blow. No one's done that. No one, even Roberto Duran called that said something about a sugar ray Leonard's wife, but that was before the fight. Afterwards they become. They became friends and then they became friends. I think it was after the second fight that became friends. Yeah. I have the first fight he tried to hold. That was like one of the famous to watch some movie there. Roberto Duran pushed him away. No, I never saw it, but after the end of the first fight, he tried to like embrace Duran Duran.

Speaker 7:          01:26:46       Pushed him well and he's still wanting to fight. It's pretty crazy. It's a crazy ending of the fight. See if you can pull up the video. The very last moments of the round with the first time Roberto Duran fought sugar ray Leonard. He beat him and he knew at the end that he beat him and so when the bell rang, you just fucking dropped his glove and he's like staring him down like he's still ready to go. It's crazy. Roberto Duran was a wild motherfucker back. You mentioned if after Michael Mike Tyson knocked out Michael spinks. Then when they get in the post binding or interview, he said, I'll eat his children. I can't imagine him saying that after the fight people will go, what the fuck ways. We have Michael spinks children at finance. So this is, uh, the first fight. At the very end seconds he goes to shake his hand.

Speaker 7:          01:27:34       He's like, fuck you. So he comes near. I'm looking at this, what the Fuck Outta here? He pushes them away. Fuck, that was after the first fight. After the fight was over, he pushed him. Riley's fucking screaming at him. He's like, fuck you. Yeah. And when did he say that thing to sugar ray's wife before for this fight? For this? Yeah, that's right. He got into Ted. Did that to get in his head. Oh, well he was just that guy to the. Apparently there was a, there was an article written where they went to visit him and Panama and uh, he took a cat and he picked it up by the tail and smashed against a wall. And they were like, well, according to the movie it was a. He had moments where he got out of control, but generally it was a very good guy in the movie.

Speaker 7:          01:28:15       Two movies are weird. I don't know if they're true, but apparently he did that too. I've read the story. I don't, I don't know what the story might be bullshit, but I'm like, if he was that crazy, you know, living on the streets in Panama, like becoming a savage boxer. He was so good too, man. He was ferocious. And when he beat up Davey Moore and Dave, you remember that David Morris was thought to be the guy, like in everybody thought after no moss. Roberto Duran was done. So they had this kid stud boxer, David, more world champion at 1:54, I believe. That was after no months. Yeah, there was the comeback fight. Roberto Duran, when he was really fully back, he boxed up. David Morgan stopped him, was a tremendous upset because David Moore was a lot bigger than them to white guy. No, David was black guy. David wound up getting killed, uh, working on a car fucked

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       up. He was trying to fix his car and he fucked up with the Jack and it crushed them. They could be conspiracy, yes or no and look into it. Oh Man. So, um, you saw the UFC this weekend. Do you see where I fucked up and I, I interviewed Daniel cormay after he had been knocked out. Here's, here's something that's like, people think that somehow or another, a doc told me not to do that. And I did it. Nobody said anything. It was just a 100 percent my fuck up. And it was also my idea in the first place to stop interviewing fighters after they'd been knocked out. It was 100 percent my idea. And how often did it happen before in championship fights? It happened often, right? Almost always. Whether a guy got knocked out or Tko or submitted or last decision, I would interview the winter and I would interview the loser every time, every time, unless they ran out of the cage, which has happened before.

Speaker 1:          01:29:57       I get it. So you're just on running on instincts and this is what happened. Um, I was there for Gonzaga versus cro cop. Remember Gonzaga head kick, Cro, cop, and just fucking into oblivion and it was bad and I interviewed Cro Cop afterwards and I'm telling you, that dude had no idea what I was talking about. Yeah. And I remember saying to the, to the production team at the time, it was like, man, I don't think we should interview guys after they get knocked out like that. That was my nice my saying like that. And then I'm. The one time it happened again, it was with allister and after when Alistair overeem fuss deep, a mule chick and he remembered this gating that didn't really happen. You remembered a steep, a tapping rather. And it didn't really happen. I was like, this poor guy, like he's, he really has this memory in his head and it's just not correct because he just got knocked the fuck out.

Speaker 1:          01:30:46       He got knocked unconscious on television, like completely flat line and then a few minutes later I'm asking him to be coherent. I'm like, I don't think it's fair. So it was my idea to stop doing this and the UFC agreed. So it's not like, like they said, we got to stop doing it and I viol violated my own idea and I just did it on. This is what happened after the fight was over. First of all, the fight was crazy. Shocking how violent the ending was because John Really did fucking hate Daniel and Daniel I think really did hate John or at least had real anger. There was real emotions with these guys. It was insane. It was intense. When John landed that fucking head kick and you saw him moving in for the kill and then he, he stopped them right in front of us. He got on top of him and just blasted him.

Speaker 1:          01:31:37       It was like right there. I remember looking over and I'm like, Jesus, he was just dropping del close real close to. It was pretty close, if I remember correctly. I want to say it was like right off to my right. If I remember correctly. You had a good look at it. I had a real good look at it. Yeah, I mean obviously I'm cage side. I got a good look at everything, but I had a real good look at that. It intense. It was intense and it was also. I felt like there was a couple of shots, too many, so I remember being stunned like, oh, I'm a. I'm a big fan of John Jones, but I'm also a big fan of Daniel and I'm a fan of both of them. I know they don't like each other, but I like both of them. I liked them independently.

Speaker 1:          01:32:16       It just, I can't help the fact their enemies, but I love hanging out with John and I love hanging out with Danny. I love doing commentary with Daniel. I love that guy. So I would never do anything to make him look bad. I just got. I was in shock. There was. He was confused because he got knocked out so he was confused that why the fight was stopped and said he was mad that they stopped the fight because he just didn't understand because he just been chaos. So he was arguing with big John. I didn't hear the exact words. Then he was arguing with Dana. I didn't hear the exact words that either, but Dana was in front of me. It's you got to realize when a Kao like that happens in a world championship fight and you're standing in the octagon, you're surrounded by all these people screaming and cheering.

Speaker 1:          01:33:00       The fucking noise is so loud. It's hard to figure out what the fuck is happening. So I couldn't figure out what Daniel and Dana were arguing about, but Dane, his whole head was red. He was like, he was like, that fight was amazing. He fought your heart out. Like I couldn't tell exactly what he said, like you'd hold your head up high. It was a great fight, that kind of stuff, but I think Daniel was still trying to figure out why the fight was stopped because it just had happened. He'd just woken up. Then he realized he got head kicked and then he was really sad and then he was upset and I went to go talk to him and literally as I'm going to talk to him, he's turning to me and I have the microphone. I'm like, why am I interviewing him? After he got knocked out, what the fuck is wrong with me?

Speaker 1:          01:33:42       Like I don't even realize what I was doing. I was just in shock almost like I went on instinct and I'm interviewing him. If I had a chance to stop and think I should have been like, oh yeah, he's been Kao don't do it. So in the middle of me even talking to him, I say I normally, I don't like to interview fighters after they've been knocked out, but it's just like I was stuck. I was already there talking to him and I didn't want to leave and walk away from them and I really do care about that guy a great deal. And I just watched him get knocked out. Now watch him. His heart's pouring out and he's crying, you know, when he was realizing that he got knocked out and he lost the fight. It was all awful. And um, so I put it a Po.

Speaker 1:          01:34:20       It was haunting me all night. This is, nobody had said anything. Nobody from the UFC got mad at me. No one said anything to me. There was just me thinking, why did I do that? Like, why did I interview him? I shouldn't have interviewed him even though we used to do it for every fight. Um, it was the right move to stop doing it. And ironically it was my idea. It was my move. I don't even know if other guy. I don't know if Brian standstill interviews guys after they've been knocked out. I don't think he does though, because Brian Actually said thank you to me for that because he got interviewed after he got knocked out by vandelay and he remembers thinking, I don't remember what happened. He didn't know what the fuck and they're interviewing him. He's trying to keep it together for the interview.

Speaker 1:          01:35:00       And he was like, you're right. It's not fair. It's not fair to interview a fighter after they've been knocked out. I just fucked up man. There's no other way to say it. I just, uh, I, if I could go back, I definitely would have taken it back. I definitely wouldn't have interviewed him because I feel, I feel like he didn't. And he sent me a text message saying it's all good. I didn't say anything crazy, so it's no big deal. But you know, he could have, you know, he could have said I never got stopped. I could have said, you know, he could, you don't think anything. Like if somebody doesn't explain to him well enough what happened? And then it takes a few seconds and you forget again. That's the other thing about guys have been knocked out. Like you say, if, if I got knocked out and I asked you at what happened and you said, oh, this dude just punched you in your jaw and knocked you out.

Speaker 1:          01:35:40       And be like, no way. Hey Man. What happened? Like as a few seconds later, you start asking again when you get knocked out. It's real weird. So it's a huge fuck up on my part. But it was, I was in shock. Honestly. It was so ferocious. The final barrage was so ferocious and there was the way it was. The Way John did it when you heard them, once he knew he heard them, he just started going after him. And one of the spookiest things that he did, was he, the way he tripped him, see what he tripped him like Daniel's like sort of stumbling back and John just sorta scoops his leg out from under him and Trypsin Daniel Falls back and John just moves in on him and you could tell Daniel just couldn't get his feet back under them and John just jumped on him and just marked them.

Speaker 3:          01:36:23       [inaudible] did great on his feet for awhile there. He did great. But I was really impressed with John John Stryker to. He throws so much unorthodox. She, those stomps on the knees do. That's high level shit. And the volume. Yes. Throwing strikes. Yeah. That's his, that's his shit. He was in tremendous shape. Stolen those uh, those elbows from, you know, from left field, you know, right down the pipe. Yeah. He's done a lot of elbows, man. And he's throwing all kinds of shit. He throws everything front kicks. There was a lot of front kick right to the. Yeah. Those fret snap kegs throws those oblique kicks in. Hyperextends your needed love that can't get close to him. I'd love that. Whoa, I hope it keeps going because he's evolving so much as a striker. I hope he. I hope against hope it gets good to gather 100 percent.

Speaker 3:          01:37:12       You never seen him arrested again. No more bullshit. No one cares about that. I do. Don't want them to get arrested again. It's like he tore his acl. What's the difference? I believe that he's going to be back. I know it doesn't matter. Let them party. He's the king of the world. He's the. He's the probably the best fighter of all time. Let them do some coke. Let them party data should be getting some house. You know what I mean? Fuck it. He gets fucked up. Hey, that's actually better press. So what he needs is like you should fake Duis and drunk and stoned just like they do. And TMZ, he just needs a constant security detail to keep everything away from him. Let him, let him do whatever he wants. He's the king of the fucking world. You don't want them getting. We'd lost a whole year of him and then we lost a year before that.

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       I don't want him to get Tyson that that's for sure. He can get locked up for five years. That shit happens. A peanut. You want what you want them to do is have fun, but don't do anything illegal. Don't let him drive. Take us. Take his keys. Still want to do anything illegal. Saturday team. Have a rubber party room locked up, but just say, dude, you'd go off five hours, whatever you want. Boom, but you can leave this room. Do you ever been to one of them? A bouncy warehouses? We can go from one trampoline to the next champion that all the time, me and my son go the time. Those are the best man. Best. So anyway, even though I already talked to Daniel, I felt like I put it on twitter. I apologize on instagram and I was like, I gotta apologize in the podcast too.

Speaker 3:          01:38:42       I fucked up and it was just a. It was. There was no other explanation. Is it? Is it because of the name of his crying face? No, I'm just meeting just to talk to them. That means you're going to have names, man. You got to accept me as part of the other ones. Come to mind. There's so many. Knock out means you have the Rashad Evans one that's pretty pop. It's one of the most of the Jose Aldo one. That's pretty good. That's on the underground. The underground. Boom. It's the Jose Aldo. Get clipped by A. There's so many of them. Did you ever see the video of the dude that came up to Rashad and asked him to sign one of the posters of a shot? All fucked up where we say that again? Some dude had the balls to come up to Rashad at, uh, one of those signings and try to get Rashad to sign the picture. The one picture. Where is all Jack? And try to get them to sign that. Rashad crumpled it up. Him Up.

Speaker 7:          01:39:31       He thought he was being cute. What's this? That's the dude. He walks up to him. He says, get the fuck out of here man. Oh Shit. Damn. He's like, no, get out of here. Go. You want to hear it? So hold on. Oh, that, rewind it. So it will go before that. When you see him rip it up.

Speaker 9:          01:39:53       Mexicans here dammit. Mexicans hands in the picture. Crumples it up and throws it at me. He's laughing and he pushes him and like get out of here man.

Speaker 3:          01:40:15       He's laughing. This is cute. Rashad looked like he was going to smash him.

Speaker 3:          01:40:22       He took a picture with a friend though because I think it was photoshop Steve that made a. He made a photoshop of like a shot of inside of a plane and see everyone's sitting down and see a bunch of people and you know, sometimes you know when you're on a plane and going overseas and everyone's crashed out at night, you know what I mean? You're walking, you go take a piss. And everyone, everyone has their crash out face. Right? So he put like all those famous knockout faces on people on a planet. And you were in there too. I think you were wide awake though. You're wide awake and all of these like beat door knocked

Speaker 7:          01:40:54       on over here so far was one of the greatest photoshops of all time. I don't know where it's at though. That's just a price that you pay if you're going to be a part of that world, that world, if you, when you get an insane amount of glory, you know, but you only get that glory because there's a risk of getting the opposite of that. Jamie Foxx was talking about the other day. We were talking about Michael Jordan that a lot of people don't even know who Michael Jordan is. They just know, Oh, you the cry baby face you. That made me face. People see that meme and you cease to become an individual. Been crying in that meeting. What was the original source of that? I don't know. What was the interview? I think it was hall of fame induction in the hall. I was talking about his haters. He was calling out his haters really in his hall of fame can here that God. It's one of the craziest hall of fame speeches ever. It made people reevaluate how they feel about them. Some people lost all respect. I want to hear that. Some people understood it. He's talking shit about like reporters and coaches and hair play. It's kind of telling the truth, I'm sure, but it's just fascinating to listen to. Oh No, this isn't it. This is like how to fail and still be a winner and all that shit.

Speaker 7:          01:42:05       Here it goes here. This shit. Twenty three minutes launch. That's okay. Just give me a little volume. Let's get to the good part. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:42:15       Kind and said, yeah, I do it. And that was a disrespect to, into my Carolina guys. They all know them. I'm a true Blue Carolina guide to the heart, you know, coach Smith, Larry Brown,

Speaker 7:          01:42:25       Sam Perkins, James Worthy, all of those guys.

Speaker 10:         01:42:32       Well, it all starts with my, my parents. Uh, you guys see all the highlights. What is, what is it about me that you guys don't know? Uh, as I sat up and I watch all the other recipients stand up here and they give them the history and so many things I didn't know about Jerry Sloan and know he lived on the farm, but I didn't know he was in a small classroom from first grade to the eighth grade. Uh, even David Robinson, obviously I've known David for some time and

Speaker 7:          01:42:59       we're going to lose the audience here. Let's see. I don't know what the part where he got mad at people, but he was maybe a youtube. Michael Jordan insults gets mad. Oh, he mad. Oh yeah, something like that. Michael. Michael Jordan. How about Michael Jordan? Oh, he mad. Jamie's eating that cake. Shake those things to share. I think I have one fuck right now. A bunch in the frazier. Frigerator back there. They're all Quito to. Yeah, give me one of them. Yeah. No affiliation with this company. Ladies and gentlemen. They're just good. I don't know shit about them. They might be monsters. Yeah, those are good man. Yeah, you got to shake it a little bit. There you go. They're very thick. It's like a, um, like a milkshake or some shit. What flavors are strawberry? Powerful. Right. Um, so what did you think about the Cyborg? I felt like

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       it was kind of weird seeing Tanya evenger. So outsized, you know, fighting Cyborg, who's like, yeah, it's real thick. Like sometimes I eat it with a spoon. What'd you think about that fight? Cyborg is just too goddamn good. Tania Singer, she's the old girl. She's tough and she's out of her weight class. She almost didn't have a chance almost. You know what I mean? She had a chance but wasn't the best chance and sideboard fought a very technical fight. She's such a good striker. Jesus super technical now too. You see she's not taking too many crazy chances. She's just picking our spots. She's a machine and she's really good on the ground. Too hard to take down. Hereso Breslin's good. Her work ethics. Insane. She's legit brown belt, right? Is it Jean? Is She? I believe she is. Last I heard. I didn't know. Maybe she's got a black but, but she's legit.

Speaker 3:          01:44:42       What was impressive to me that, you know, like evenger was like trying to be crafty and move around and be an unorthodox and throwing a good job. And she was looking for a response. Just she was just outgun but Cyborg didn't just try to gorilla fucker. You know what? I know she didn't just try to check her, chase her down and smash her. She picked apart out her, did a great, a great job of hacking at the legs, landon shots, and then once she had her time to evergreen. I'd love that girl. You know what's, she's tough as fuck, man. Just one of the coolest things about mma is how openmindedness we are with lesbians, right? I mean we don't even. It's no big deal at all with girls. Put her on the countdown show. Two girls. The Nunez is the champ. Yes. And no one knows.

Speaker 3:          01:45:27       We're like totally cool. We're all, you know Tom [inaudible] on instagram live making out with chicks at bars drinking. You know what I mean? Yeah. She's, she's a party girl and you're allowed to be a big old lesbian. Yeah. We're so open minded. Guys were still in Jesus. Only one dude want to do that I know of. That's openly gay. Gay Porn. It was on tough. Oh, wait a minute. There's an ultimate versus name Dakota, Dakota Cochrane, I think his name was cock ring. No Cochran. That's his last name right there. That was like a sub. That was a part of the show. That's what they were talking about. Damn. Okay. There's one. Yeah, hold on. I'm still, we're way behind. We're way behind because there should be at least, but I don't necessarily mean there should be saying. Okay. I think he was just saying he did gay porn. I'm out. You know what? I love gay people. My favorite singer of all time. He's a Favi gang. Uh, anyways. Uh, I have no problem with problem with people being gay. I think they should come out. You know, I lived in West Hollywood for almost 20 years. You were surrounded by gay people. Every time I visit, you either swim to a river. Gay people come to your house. Yeah. Yeah. If you got, if you're a guy, you were still in Jesus' times, unfortunately. I mean, maybe, maybe it's not

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       the best thing that come out if you're an m and a right, but it's for comedy. Nobody gives a fuck. Football people care, right? You can be. Can you be openly gay, openly gay in football. How many guys does one or two? There's that one guy came out right before the draft and you got right now there's a few now about how many. I mean not tons. It's probably equal to the population. Maybe like 10 percent. No. Well way football. No Way. Guys, why do you think there's 50 openly gay football players want to believe? I want to believe you. Well, Google going to say I'm going to say too. Okay. You say to say to I say five. Jamie, what do you say? Say something I wasn't saying. I'll just be right close to the average. So it's like what? Eight to 10 percent. So it's probably like 30, $40 out of the closet is what I'm talking about this. No, no, no. That's what I'm talking about. The national average is not considered out of the closet. Does it? Nationally? Just how many people are gay? Yes, but how many people are out of the closet in the NFL? I say there's one or two says there's been a lot, but there have been 11 known gay players. Nana and they all got. Come on.

Speaker 1:          01:47:57       They're all there now, but it's interesting. We're not that open. No guys are not that open. There's a lot of players. Think about how many players there are. Yeah. All right. Now let's go this way. What percentage of the population is gay versus what percentage of the population is out of the closet? Oh Shit. I think if you had to guess

Speaker 6:          01:48:19       of all of all the gay people in the United States, I would say I'm going to guess 50 percent are out of the closet. Fifty one new thing. Thirty or out of the. Yeah, it could be 30. It could be 10. It could be 10. Depending on where you live. If you're in California, you're still in the closet. You're probably a UFC fighter.

Speaker 1:          01:48:43       Were you around when the Edmonton fight happens? Are you around during that week? What day you got to do a fight companion. This is a kind of interesting. Um, this is totally unrelated to this weekend. This is actually, what is it? September ninth. September ninth? Yeah. Is that a Saturday? Yeah. Saturday. I'm, I'm there on Friday it Edmonton for um, you're doing two shows at this auditorium. I'm, uh, the jubilee auditorium to two shows that this theater, but I'm not doing the paper due the next night. Okay. So we'll do a fight compatible. I go back home. Yeah. It was weird because it's a, it's a main event. It's a mighty mouse versus a Ray Borg. And Amanda Nunez Ares Valentina Shevchenko, but there, I don't think they're anticipating that it's going to be a, a high pay per view cell. Know. Let's do it. That sounds like fun. Yeah, it's on. See. I would like to get callan and shot, but shops become too fucking successful. He's too successful. That fucking

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       baller. He's traveling all over the place. Selling out everywhere he's selling out theaters has been doing standup for like six weeks. He sounds out. He's been doing it more than that. He's been doing it like a year, but he's selling out everywhere down. Dude. He did what I said. I was like, I was telling all these other comedians. I say, you see what you've seen here. I go, this is what happens when an athlete shows you how lazy you guys are. Like this guy was like just starting out, but he actually works at it. He does like a ton of sets. He writes a ton. Like he actually puts in the time, like that's what athletes do. Comics like to pretend they're working and they fuck off a lot and keep doing the same machine material for 10 years and shop is like out there. So again, I'm no expert at comedy, but it's, I think in my opinion, it's a lot like Jujitsu.

Speaker 3:          01:50:32       You gotta practice and refund. It's a lot like writing music because you can, you. If you're going to rely on just going up there and riff and fuck, good luck, good luck. It's like trying to write a song like, okay, we're going to record a song. We have no idea what we're going to do, but we're going to jam. And he all right, and then we'd go and that's the hit song. The odds of that happening, super slim. You've got to record a jam, pick out a little pieces, Polish it, add this two months later, oh, you got a middle part. Now a month later you got the intro. It's all coming together. Might take eight months to get that bit together. You know, you're just constantly going back and forth. That's how music is put together and that's how Jujitsu's put together. You've got to constantly refine your game.

Speaker 3:          01:51:11       You're out there getting ready, what are you doing wrong? What's working? Let's stick to what's working with. Add some new shit, learning from other people, techniques and being open minded, understanding that your body is magical and it'll do anything you wanted to do. You just got to tell it over and over and over again to a point where it does it by itself, without you even knowing what the hell is going on and it's unconscious. You could do anything. You could play piano, you can play a guitar. It's like, Oh, I tried guitar, but it's too hard. You just didn't practice. That's all. Anybody could play guitar. Anybody could play guitar. Anybody can play piano songs. Your neurons fire correctly. It's just your hands move just takes time. You got in a motorcycle accident and you smash your hands and you're like this. You can't play piano, but I'm just saying if you have normal limbs, you could play piano, could play guitar, you can do anything.

Speaker 3:          01:52:00       You could. You could do anything. You can learn Jujitsu. You can box. You can play basketball. He never played basketball in your life and you're 55 years old. If you practiced hard for a year, it'd be I. I know people don't want to believe that though. It's hard for them to believe it because they're not reminded of it all the time. That's why a lot of people coming from Jujitsu and martial arts in general, they become successful because through Jujitsu you're constantly reminded that you can suck at something and then you get pretty good at it and then you mastered and then it's unconscious. You reminded that every time you go to Jujitsu everyday you're reminded, damn, I can do this with anything, and people do it with their business. They go, all I gotta do is do hustle in the in the Gi, Jujitsu of business

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       and make it happen or whatever you want to do. You're reminded like, Shit. You like it. When I say magical, it's not a metaphor. It is magical because your body will do shit on its own. Like when you like when you're doing Jujitsu, sometimes I come up with moves. I don't know what the fuck I did. I did something I have no idea and then it comes up again because I've programmed and drilled my body so much and has so many things that I trained it to do a on instincts that it's kind of like a suggestion thing. Like when you hit youtube and they kind of know what you like and here's the suggestions, like your body will go. He always does this and he always does that and he always does this unconsciously. Man, he might like this and then you're like, oh shit.

Speaker 5:          01:53:27       What was that? It's like your body can someone else came up with that and then the next time you do like, there it is again. That's how most of the moves that are transitions that I get good at. They come up like on their own and then the third time we got I got it and then I videotape, but then I've videotaped myself doing it. I'm like, Shit, I didn't even know I was doing that. It was just like, your body will make shit up for you. You everybody. Not just me. It's everybody. You just gotta learn how to capture it. It's like comedy p. people love comedy because they go see a comedian and he's saying all this shit that they agree with and they're laughing and going, yeah, I think that this, this comedian is amazing. He saying shit that if you're laughing, you agree with that.

Speaker 5:          01:54:05       Like you all the shit that he said you've set and people around you have said it. You just didn't notice it as something to use on stage. So once you. It's just like music when you. Every time you listen to music, like for me, anytime I listen to music and I like something musically, which is rare, I'm going to find out everything about that song. There's that. I don't ever get lazy with that. I find out who sang the song, I downloaded the song, I analyze a song like, what is it about this song that makes it so great? Why am I getting chills listening to the song? Why do I have this song on repeat? You know, that's. I'm trained musically to always try to capture golden nuggets. Every time I hear it, oh, I'll be in a middle of a conversation in Japan at Tgi Fridays in Tokyo and in the distance a song would come on and I'm in the conversation with some people and I hear it and it just.

Speaker 5:          01:54:55       I know that I tell the people I'm with, I'll be right back. I gotta find out what the song is. I'll write it down them. I just do the other Dj. That's kind of a DJ thing. So my point is it's same thing with Jujitsu. It same thing with comedy. It's same thing with music. You just gotTa. It's all around you. You just gotTa look for it. You've got to train yourself to look for. Maybe you have to write shit on your hand to train, remind yourself, think, think about. Then once that becomes your instinct once looking for shit and recognizing should always be on the call for Shit. Like uh, for instance, like editors do to edit videos every time they're watching a movie, what are they doing? They're breaking down the editing. You're right, of course like movie makers are breaking down the lighting. They're watching them and we feel the hidden directors of movies, you know, a lot of ways, like the directors, they get all these ideas,

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       they put it together, but a lot of times you'd get on a television show as well to editor will make these passes at things when they give you like a, like an editor's first cut. And a lot of times it's like, you know, the director would look at and go, I liked that. Like that. That's good. You don't get any better. You got to have an editor who, who knows, who knows this. He, yeah. You got to be talented. Not just some slave that's gonna cut shit together. And there's a lot of talent and the editing you to be, especially in television shows. Right? Or I guess in movies too, you know? Yeah, I get the editors that I got working from his hot level. Amazing that editor like that movies are still in a theater now, so one of the rare things you do when you go somewhere like just to, to get, uh, some, some sort of art where it's not live, you're going to go to a place still, like they still have them like that and I don't know if I'd been brainwashed because I love, I love to, but I'm just saying it's weird because it's like one of the few places we have left, we'll, we'll go and take in media at a, at a specific location.

Speaker 3:          01:56:46       We all meet, like we go for a live show, we'll go for a live show, but if you, you're not going to go to see like have a fake band somewhere. Gigantic screen that's like a 100 times bigger than you. And the sound is amazing. Yeah. So there's all that crazy though. Then it's cool sitting with people and when they laugh you laugh and it's continual. You want to laugh more when there's other people around, but you run the risk of douchebags run the risk that people talk and people talk and the people that do that violate the sacred laws of the movie theater. You got to go in which big old Como de shades and a beanie and a fake beard. Crazy. You know, beards are. So in these days, what happened to the fake beard market? Like, why isn't there like dudes like wearing fake beards to clubs and you know what I mean, like posing fake shit.

Speaker 3:          01:57:37       Girls can wear fake asses. They can have fake tits. Fake, fair, fair. It's kind of like there's a lot of things that aren't fair. And that's one thing that they got, you know, we can't have, we can't be the same. So whoever was deciding on men and women like, okay, you get this, you get that. It isn't fair. Like the women were like, okay, okay, if you're gonna, uh, you get uh, you guys, you know, they're, they, they can't control it. Guys are attracted to girls with nice bodies fit by. Generally. There are some guys just nice bodies, like there's something about actual fake tits that's hot because it's like, wow, this girl is. She's in the deck so much. She just wants to be like ultra attractive in a cartoonish way. Like look at those giant fake tits jet. Some guys, some guys are like, I don't like fake tits. They're still some of those guys out there that there's like a 15 percent of the population. Eventually another generation, those will be all gone and fake. Tits would just be accepted by all men, but fake ass. Woo. That's going to take a couple of generations. That's going to happen. This. Nobody

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       is cool with fake asses. Nobody. That's the worst shit ever. The don't get it. Girls don't even think about it. Yeah, but the gray area is this fat thing they're doing and what is not a fake ass, but they're taking fat grafting fat that's still grow parts. Do some squats, do some squats. Anybody could have a great body, just do some squats. Not that's not true. There's some people out there that got some fucked up. There's nothing wrong with hillbilly stick. Stick people, those people, you got to get good at sucking Dick, you gotta eat ass. You eat ass and sucked it. I don't want to. They think they have no choice to get the fat. Stuff's want to reengineer. The older you get, the more women eat. As I was reading this thing about Crispr, that they're starting to use crispr for a Jew for embryos now, and they think they're really close to genetically engineering.

Speaker 1:          01:59:33       The first people that become viable, actual humans. Do you know what Crispr is? No, dude, it's like photoshop for jeans. They're looking at this scientist edit human embryos for the first time in the US. They're, they're using this new technology which is way more complicated than my puny brain has the ability to describe, but it's a gene editing tool called crispr and there is a, an episode, another episode of radio lab that's about crispr that it might be like a good way for you to get an entertaining but descriptive, uh, explanation of it. But, uh, they're, they're going to be able to at least someday in the future if this keeps going, they keep perfecting this. They're going to be able to edit things out of people like they're going to be able to take away the the gene for Alzheimer's, you know? I don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:00:24       What do you mean? You don't know? I don't know. They always say shit like in the future doing it now and they're doing it now. Like there's real science behind this. Like you could, you could follow the science. They're editing things the same way. They're making photoshop the same way. They're making that new thing that allows them to edit videos. They're gonna edit genes. How about those contact lenses where you can play video games and you're seeing some Microsoft made and stuff? Yeah, I don't think they have that yet. I think they have glasses so far, but I don't think they have contact lenses. Contact Lenses. Retinal. Yeah. It's going to happen. If you could do it with a, with the glass, like Google. You ever see Google glass? You ever put that on? It was weird that Google glass isn't around anymore. They've got some new applications for it.

Speaker 1:          02:01:08       But what it was like was like, um, like a glass frame and yeah. This little thing in front of you like a little window, like a tiny little tv that was sitting in front of your eyes because it's clear and on that little window you could see through it, but you could also see like a navigation directions and uh, you could google things and have it brought up in front of you and maybe steal shit. Yeah, like some, some movie shit. But it was like the Internet, like you're making phone calls. I know these guys, you know, they're not, I have no idea who people are. I mean, don't

Speaker 7:          02:01:40       like drinking it. Yeah. You need to stab. Well, let's not do it while the podcast going on and just sucking on that thing and chewing it. A spoon. Okay. Real quick. S black helicopters. Um, they're good though. I like them. You got a spoon or no? Eddie Bravo. Abandoned you in the middle of a podcast for a knife.

Speaker 4:          02:02:03       I'm sorry. You offered it defaults. Cave shakes blowing up. Now their stock's going through the roof. What were we just talking about? This ar stuff. This is going to be built into apple's new operating system, allows you to read how big something is. It's a virtual tape measure that you just hold your camera up to stuff and you can talk like they're right here. They're showing you that is how accurate it is. But like it see the tape measure staying there. They're measuring the size of a picture frame diagonally and it stays in space. Uh, if I'm saying, if you get what I'm saying, like I do the three d space, it knows where you're modeling depending on how far away you are from it and those. Wow. The other weird thing is by watching that show, the planet of the Apps, they just started on apple music, but I think it was in the first episode. The Sky shows an APP that he made that I think apple bought. Eventually they're adding into this operating system. They're mapping the inside of every, everywhere that your camera can take, a place or a shooting. So, uh, inside here eventually we'll be all mapped. And this guy said that he, he would own the map. That's why apple bottoms. Now apple's going to own it, so they're essentially going to be able to have the inside three d maps of every, in every building in the world or at least wherever and telling me what that sorry.

Speaker 4:          02:03:23       But uh, it's built into the phone. So there's other cool stuff too, so they can map everything just based on. We'll get there eventually. Yeah. Like, so they did something came out about Roombas, like the room are currently tracking at the inside of everybody's houses and apartments and I don't know what the hell they're going to do with that data, but people got scared they're going to sell it to someone can be good. You know what I mean? How is that going to be good? We're doing this to protect you. How? It's not about protection necessarily, but it could be used. You guys have trillions of dollars missing. It could be useful. It's not the same people, Eddie. Yeah. I mean if Jesus Christ you keep making these things are not people as the Illuminati that run the government. This can help blind pizza technologists. These are people that are creating the greatest stuff. Yeah. Sorry.

Speaker 7:          02:04:09       Okay, yeah, I mean this is not the illuminati making this stuff. Eddie. This is, this is technologist as apple. Yeah. The, apple's not the fucking Illuminati. I didn't sell the apple did get in trouble recently. Do you know what they did in China? They, uh, they made a deal with the Chinese government to um, to take aps down from their APP store that allow you to circumnavigate their, a censorship system. People were very, very upset at them because what essentially is a, they're saying that apps are illegal in China, so they're not allowing them on the apple store, but they're illegal in China because they allow them to get away from government censorship. So government censorship has a certain lock down on what you're allowed to look at online. Here it is. Apple Removes Apps from the Chinese store that help Internet users of aid censorship.

Speaker 7:          02:04:56       Very disappointing to people because they feel like apple kind of like, feels like maybe they have to do this other New York Times trying to get us to pay. How dare you? New York Times. No one's paying for articles online. Just stop, just stop with the FEC pays for articles online. Who gets newspapers, still have your old. Do you ever get one of your in a hotel and they offer you the USA Today to see what the fuck the world pay attention to man USA Today. That's like a CNN of newspapers. If you had to guess like what percentage of people actually read the whole USA Today? Every day. Two percent. No Way. Less than one percent. Less than one for sure. One hundred percent, but that was just making a point to, well, it's just like a e entertainment news for the world, you know? It's like, it's like very surface. Yeah. I mean it's just you're supposed to get it at a hotel, like what's going on?

Speaker 7:          02:05:53       Oh, we won the football game. What do you think about that? Other religions of Donald Trump and CNN. What? What I think was crazy was it cnn went and found the guy who made the meme and put it online and they scared him. Gangster, right? Yeah. Like what are you doing? Matt? And them blackmail them, but what, how crazy is that? Like you don't think that that's funny. Is that what you're saying? Like he was in the wwe, you know, donald was in the wwe, you knew that that video is available and they put a CNN thing over your face. You're actually mad at that. You at that. You're not mad at the six point $5,000,000,000,000 missing, but you're mad at that. That seems pretty fucking crazy to me. That seems pretty crazy to me. You're going to go after a guy who made a comical meme about the president body slamming you, made him apologize publicly.

Speaker 7:          02:06:38       Dude. How many memes are there of a sucking dicks? GotTa be thousands, right? It's like the golden rule of the Internet. If there's a photo of you online somewhere, someone has photoshop to dick in your mouth and now it's going to get even crazier. There's probably at least 50 gay. You just showed me the one you showed me of you and me in a wrestling statue with the dudes grabbing the Dudek. Yup. Yup. That's what photoshop, Steve, but what it. My point is that they would get so mad at that that they would go after the guy who made it. That sort of reinforces the side of trump. Like people don't get that. They don't understand that if you, you, you have something that's comical, right? Like that meme of Donald Trump's slam and CNN and then you go find the guy who was just joking around, made a little animated Gif joking around, put it online.

Speaker 7:          02:07:33       I thought it was funny. Everybody a laugh, you know all he smashed. In fact fake news. Ha Ha, ha ha. And you go and scare that guy. You go and scare that guy. What are you doing? What's going on? You know what's scarier? You're CNN. What's scarier than that is that there's still people that watch that shit every day. Yeah. After that, after knowing that you're going to still watch it and believe it. The other thing was the store, they made up about Russian contacts about, uh, there's like three reporters had to resign. It was store that was on cnn to like greatly exaggerated. I think CNN is, they just want to start shit. I think it's not the one to make money. They just want to start shit. I think it's part. I think it's part of the agenda. I think this is what I think they feel like if there's an enemy out there and the enemy is the new president, they think there's an enemy and they feel like they're going to war with the enemy and when you have a bunch of soldiers that are going to war for the enemy, some of them do some unscrupulous shit.

Speaker 7:          02:08:33       Like these people that got. They had to resign because the story with Russia with the fake facts. I forget what the actual thing was, but CNN disavowed their article, pulled it down, removed it whole deal. Three journalists leaving CNN after retracted article. CNN journalists, including the executive editor in charge of a new investigative unit, have resigned after the publication of a Russia, Russia related article that was retracted. So you can go into details as you wanted it. You know what? What if. What if the CNN Donald Trump feud is like pro wrestling? What if they're just laughing and they're just slinging shit back and forth talking to a guy the other day that thinks that he thinks it's all about setting up China, he said said, it's all about us going to war these other countries. He thinks there's all these distractions are happening and that's what's. And positioning North Korea and China on the side of North Korea and you know it's crazy by North Korea, the most.

Speaker 7:          02:09:27       They're the most demonized country on the planet. Oh, they're always testing missiles or testing, miss it. Since the Korean War. You know how many countries they've invaded and killed innocent civilians? Zero. How many countries have we invaded and killed? Millions of civilians like 20 or 30 since the Korean War, but they're the bad guy. They're the bad guy. They're not invading anybody. They've never invaded anybody. We invade people all the fucking time and kill innocent children and come on, this is a big show going on. There's nothing that's true, but it is a dictatorship. Like what's a scary dictatorship? They have no control. No, no, no. It's not. It's not the people who have been there and studied it. No one disagrees, Eddie. I think it's out of control at a prison country. Yeah. They're all in prison by the show. I think it's, there's no show and Eddie, they do. They do and it is scary, but they're a minor league problem, like in comparison to a lot of other problems that are in the line. I don't believe that because CNN pushes it so everybody approaches it. Eddie, I think there's no one out there that's saying that North Korea is not a military threat. Are there not some sort of a military dictatorship? I think it's a distraction

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       thing on it. I don't think there's that many people out there and never invaded anybody. We've invaded the country, but this guy's still a psychopath that's running this whole country in 2017. That scares the fuck out of psychopath. So we got a lot of people did Michael. Malice does. He's an author that I had on the podcast that wrote a book about Kim Jong. Uhm, and you know, he was describing was a una ill, ill isn't a new guy. No, that's the young guy, Kim. Kim Jong Un is the dad, the dad. The Dad is the kid. The new one. The new one. Okay, so that was Kim Jong Il, but it's called dear reader. It's a very, very good book and interesting to find out how fucked up it is over there. It's a system that's set up so that everybody's in prison by it. Everybody tells on everybody else, like their setup to tell on each other, like the people that have escaped and they've left and gone to South Korea and they'll tell the stories about the prison camps.

Speaker 3:          02:11:27       People are born in prison camps over there. Eddie, I think their prisoner actors. Oh, come on, Jesus. I don't get mad because I say that. Why am I going to get killed for saying a whole group of the whole country's a bunch of actors to getting a check. I think the presenters and they're forced to do parades. Yeah, they're definitely prisoners. They definitely forced to pray. Exactly. Yeah, like the whole country's a prison. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm. That's what I said, but they're not actors acting when they're being filmed. The guys, they're acting. They're not real. They're not being sincere. They're acting. They're forced to act the prisoners. But wait a minute, do you think that this country is under the control of a military dictatorship and everyone's terrified of doing anything wrong? You think that. Okay, so you think that. What do you mean by they're acting though?

Speaker 3:          02:12:11       There's. They're all terrified. Like how are they acting? In what way they're. They're acting like they're in love with Kim Jong. Terrified. Yeah. They all do that. That's, that's they. They were arrested. They went to jail. A bunch of people did for not crying hard enough when his dad died. Not crying hard enough like people did like six months of hardly come up with all that shit. He got a haircut and he made everyone get the same haircut. Look into that. That's. Yeah, that's a fake story that everyone thinks is true, that he got a haircut and he made every man in the country get a haircut or they get killed or something or get thrown in prison. I never saw that you. It's bullshit. Maybe did maybe that gangster high top fade or die because motherfuckers don't like high top fade or die. They don't have shit.

Speaker 3:          02:13:01       What do you mean they don't have nuclear weapons? You don't think so? Well, let's just bring you to a Washington DC and clean this up. That's. I'm just, I don't believe Shit. You know, robin, trillions of dollars I think. I think you should not believe in anything coming from the mainstream media. Anything. If they're all pushing it, then it can't be the truth. North Korea themselves. I mean they definitely launched a missile. The missile they launched yesterday say they don't believe it. No. Who's they? That's what they said. That Fox News. Everybody. They're all. It's all mainstream media. So do you think they're all in on it? I think it's a distraction. I think there's some serious shit going on in Washington DC and they need that shit. Oh, they're there. They're sending out missiles again and everyone's afraid of world war three. It's two gangs. Not Anybody. We've invaded 30 countries or 20 or 30 countries since the Korean War.

Speaker 3:          02:13:50       We've killed millions of innocent people on some bullshit ass wars and we're worried about North Korea. That's ridiculous. True. But again, that we're brainwashed, or maybe they are a military dictatorship with nuclear power. I'm very suspect experts. Latest North Korean missile could strike Boston in New York City. Eddie Bravo. Skeptical. Hippo face. I mean, this is a trap, man. Got a beautiful haircut though. Look at that. Sweet. Did you know in the Korean War we made this mainstream news? We made 18 cities disappearing. It was horrible. What they did, they made the Soviets get the fuck out. The Soviets left and and after the Korean War, the United States was like, what are we going to do with that? China says we'll take over. So since the Korean War, it hasn't been officially Soviets. The Soviets officially left and then China took over. They kind of manage it and govern it. I think it does. I think it's just like a little prison country that they use to.

Speaker 3:          02:14:47       They used as the bad guy. I think. I wouldn't be surprised if Kim junk doesn't even live in Korea. Just all Hologram does. It. Just take videos, if you watch the videos easily faked, easily fit. There is no proof of anything. There's no proof of shit. You're right. They're showing video, but missile going up. Oh, I believe that after they still in trillions of dollars, we we shouldn't believe shed a smart man wouldn't believe shit that the missiles that are getting launched in the area. So all the people like missiles, missiles say that. I didn't say so. That's why I assume they don't have missiles. If we thought they. I'm talking about. I'm talking about North Korea. They have missiles. That's what they tell you, that the Russians and the Russian sell them shit. That's what the Chinese, the Russians, everything. They say they who's they? The same people that stole the trillions of dollars, stole the trillions are also running CNN thing.

Speaker 3:          02:15:41       It's all connected. It's all connected. Definitely that. That's the truth. They are all connected. There's. I don't think you can have everything connected if they're going back and forth with each other. Like, look what's happening in between Fox News and CNN, right? Look at, look at. Look at the, the, the, the internal battery gets fake. Wow. He was a Republican and Democrats. It's a fake fucking and not really in competition with each other either. They don't care who gets more ratings, more money individually. Individually. People are worried about their own check in their own family. So individually, yes, but at the top it's just a show and I don't believe she had coming from them too much fake and six moon landings. Come on, let me, let me ask you this. Let me ask you this. Where do you think. Because one of the things that's happened for sure is as time has moved on, as technology has gotten more and more powerful and the ability to do all the stuff that

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       we can do now with our phones, all the information that you can get like almost instantly with your phone, like when is it going to reach a point where no one has any control over anyone else because it seems to me that that's inevitable. Seems to me that the idea of these big units of these big groups having control over massive amounts of people. I think at a certain point in time, if technology keeps moving the way it is, more and more people have more and more ability to communicate. You're not gonna be able to hide things. The daughter right now, and I think we're going to reach a point in time where they can't do that, like they could do that so much easier in the sixties. They could do anything in the sixties. It was easy. So

Speaker 6:          02:17:05       it was so easy to fake deaths in the sixties, fifties, fake everything. It was so easy. No one knew shit. It was Jack Ruby runs up on Lee Harvey Oswald just shoots him in the guts in front of everybody. Just let this guy run out him with a gun in his hand. They're bringing them in. They got. We've got, um, Lee Harvey Oswald. We got um. Oh, what's that guy? What's he doing? Running our way? Hey, is that a gun? Bang. He just shoots him right in the stomach and meanwhile he's probably not even dead. That looks so staged. Maybe Lee Harvey Oswald. They gotta do we gotta send you to an island while they shot that? Dude, you could see the bullet hit him, shoots him right in the guts. I think there's land that the elite have that no one knows about. Man. That's what I think I would if I was the elite, how it ask some Shenandoah.

Speaker 6:          02:17:47       We don't need to tell these motherfuckers everything. You think they think that the people running shit or like we need to tell the people we need to. They need to know they, they, they, they have a right to know. Clinton does. Like most of his days think he's just got a bunch of chicks he calls up. Hey, I don't know. I don't know. But when you watch the stroke and the resistance, there's a. They may be bullshit, but there's some was the Clinton chronicles. The Clinton chronicles is a documentary made in the nineties that you could find on youtube and it goes through his career in Arkansas and in the coke and all that stuff with the CIA. MENA, Arkansas. Wow. Well, George, senior vice president with Ronald Reagan, the Contra. All that Shit, man. There's a war on drugs. That's a scam. There's. They're not trying to stop.

Speaker 6:          02:18:33       No. God Damn drugs, they'll bust the Mexican cartel here and there just to just to say they're doing shit, but they're taking all that money. Then once again, we need to fight this drug war. They get all his fucking money. Just you think that it's just like the moon and all the space? Shit. I just Bill Clinton's doing right now. He's probably having a good time. I think he's having. Do you take to him? I think he's having a fucking great time right now to tell you the truth. Do you think they got him set up today? He's got like a sweet house and they bring them grapes and shit. He lays down. He's. There's no one's ever going to buy this movie about Barry still coming out at the end of the summer. American made five. Going to be Tom Cruise and unreal. Is this going to be? Come on. It's good propaganda film. Huh? It's not a felony if you're doing it for the good guys. Wow. Yeah, they're gonna. They're gonna. Make him look really bad one. I wonder if Fensa

Speaker 5:          02:19:29       won't be able to just say, hey, this long time ago, how can they make it look? They're going to make it look like we don't do it anymore. He was being sent a. He was barry seal's was a pilot. He was a trailer. Tom Cruise looking sexy as ever. Bad ass pile. How does he stay? He was a bad ass pilot. He had his pilot's license at 15 and so the CIA recruited him. That's mainstream. They say I recruited him because he was a bad ass pilot. Who? Who? This who was the trailer is really good.

Speaker 7:          02:19:59       Good. That's he's covered in coke and he gets out of a fucking plane. Covered in coke, steals a kid's bike. Wow. He crashed rounds at a plain film. How does Tom Cruise Day looking? Thirty five. What is he doing? His scientologists, but what are they doing? Are they doing maybe blood. They like running like those little a cotton gin looking things over his face. Have you heard? Have you heard someone Europe? This could be bullshit. Oh no,

Speaker 5:          02:20:27       but people like teens that they donate blood. Old people are buying young blood and getting transfusions.

Speaker 7:          02:20:37       Europe, it's here in silicone valley or they're doing it for real. You who's a famous billionaire? Tell me about that. What do you know are they found that if you inject young mice with the or old mice rather with the blood of young mice, it makes them act like a young mouse. It's just the way they hit for Millennia. Well, it sounds like vampires. Shit. Forget about Illuminati. Sounds like vampire stuff. Elizabeth Elizabeth bathory stuff. So they, um, they are doing this now where they take like these young healthy guys and they donate blood and then you go there and they take that blood and pump it into your system and they fill your body up with young blood. It does it work. Apparently it has some crazy like rejuvenating effect on you. So let me ask you this. Okay?

Speaker 5:          02:21:23       People, people freak out when you say the Illuminati. They're kidnapping kids and torturing babies and they want, they want it. They want to scare the shit out of them because they want adrenaline's blood and they're poking holes all over analyze blood. Apparently. If you scare the shit out of him, the the adrenal gland flushes into this is what they do. I have. Can I just talk? I don't know if it's real. I don't know if it's real, but apparently adrenalize blood is the most potent, so they scare the kids and they kill him and suck. Either they drink their blood. That's a conspiracy theory. That's a conspiracy theory, but we're already seeing this with. We're being well being. Slowly get. If the blood is good for you, for old people, I bet some billionaire is going to go. What about booking toddler blood? What about that shit? What about newborn baby blood? I bet they're thinking. Think about

Speaker 7:          02:22:20       stem cells. Thing about stem cells. Getting placental stem cells would think about all the kidnaps or embryotic 700,000 to a million kidnaps a year, so I think they're just taking babies and using them to make rich people stay alive forever. What if you were rich and fucking psychopath kid you do that? We'll let you do that. We can use crispr to artificially engineered a bunch of headless kids and you take the blood out of them. Didn't even know you got it. Blood is working right. Don't want you to think baby blood would be. It wouldn't be a shock. Or if you found out that baby blood is the best, right you this, would that be a shock? Is it immoral to have a warehouse filled with headless fake kids? They don't have any head. They never did have a hat. They were engineered with Crispr to have no head and you have them hooked up to this thing and there's still some blood into these vats and you go there and they tap you and you have to like look up and recognize that these artificial people got to be real blood.

Speaker 7:          02:23:13       If blood, they're real people, they just don't have any heads. So they never have a chance to be alive. They're connected to some machine. Is this a movie? Uh, no. Probably. It's kind of like the Matrix, right? Kind of like the Matrix but, but, but we already know teen blood is helping old people. I think it's 25 year olds is what they said for an adult with based on the fact that teen blood is better than getting like a 50 year old black. Right? Right. Yes. So that's what they're saying. Toddler blood would be better than team black. Well, here's the other thing. Maybe you're right. Here's the other thing that goes the other way, which is even more fascinating. They took the blood of old mice and they put it into to the young mice and the young man started acting old, which is kind of fucked. Wow. Like there's something in the blood and they're trying to isolate what it is. Of course, like it just makes sense. It's easy to believe like, yeah, young blood is probably better than old blood. Yeah. It's probably better. Yeah, and that's where everything comes from. It comes from the blood. Everything could blood is this. Cannabis reverses aging process in the brain. Studies suggest researchers restore the memory performance of Methuselah, methuselah mice to a juvenile stage. Whoa. Regressed to a two month old. Whoa. Using a cannabis active ingredient.

Speaker 11:         02:24:32       Whoa.

Speaker 7:          02:24:34       Interesting. That's crazy. Treatment opens up new options when it comes to treating dementia. Now imagine if we read was what you needed. I just hardcore edibles. We need to act. Ask Joey some questions. He does have some stories. We know for a fact that cannabis basically like 90 percent cure seizures and kids and and even in animals, a dog dogs that have seizures. You give him some cannabis oil, but let me ask you this, why does it fuck with your memory? How come when we're high? We're like, what the fuck was I just talking about? My theory is this. It's like there's a difference between a forgetting something and misplacing something. Like when you go out to vegas and you get hammered and you black out, there's no way someone's going to say anything to you that's going to make that memory come back of this or that.

Speaker 5:          02:25:24       They can say, dude, and then you grow and then you grabbed her and then you picked her up and then you told to get the fuck out of here and you're like, dude, I don't remember any of that. You lost your memory. Even them reminding you and telling you about what happened there. You lost your memory, but now when you're stone and you've got all this shit going on, there's, you know, we'd make blood rushes to your head so you've got so much shit going on. Shit gets misplaced. You forgot what you were talking about, but if someone reminds you of what you were talking about, you're like, oh, okay. Then you're back on track. You didn't eat any booze in that respect because. Well, there's a difference between actually a forgetting something and not remembering at all. It just complete. You did it. You were drunk.

Speaker 5:          02:26:01       You did it. You don't remember it. There's nothing anybody can do to bring it back. They can tell you all about it. You could watch it on video. It ain't coming back. Maybe the memory of you watching the video will, will, will, will stay in your brain, but no memories of. It's never coming back with weed. You're talking about all this shit you're going to have. It's you start, you start digressing and moving to this and jumping all over the place and go, what did I just say? If someone reminded you, it'll come back. It wasn't like, man, I don't remember ever talking about that. You were just talking about that. No, I don't remember that. So it's different. Well, I forget sometimes when I'm talking about, but I don't feel yet. Moments or instances or facts. If you were blackout drunk, you were a couple of times.

Speaker 5:          02:26:39       Hey Man. Coffees, those little things. Yeah. Everybody has gotten those moments where. Lockout, where or just when you know that like you're not seeing things the way other people are seeing them. Like where are like, that's why I don't understand how anybody could do like, like ketamine, like people that do like recreational ketamine never done it. Never done it either. But it's scary. You go into that k hole that they talk about. Sound good? Doesn't sound good. That doesn't sound good to me. I don't want to do that. It's some sort of animal tranquilizer, right? Something. Thanks Bro. What is it? What is it? Um, what was it called? K Hole, if it was called a wonder lust, if something was called Wanderlust, I'd be like, let me draw it. Yeah, but they call it a k hole after they've been in it. Yeah, it sounds horrible.

Speaker 5:          02:27:30       It sounds like darkness. I don't want to go there. I never had the desire to do something that was going to put you in a k hole. Fuck that. Like acid. Not into it. We did that acid podcast with jelly. I didn't think I can go. That was the only guy. Not on acid, but Ari was on acid. Joey Lee. It was fucking hysterical. I was like, you gotta change the name. You can't call it acid. I'm not going to take anything called acid. That fucks me up. That's hilarious. And He. They should've called it something else. They should have solved if they just call it Cuti Love Qd love. Yeah. Yeah. I'll take some qt. Love. What's it going to do? Oh, just make you look you so I'll with joey would drop some math. You don't give a fuck man. Yeah. Joey's. He's downtown gangster. That's the yelling and everywhere to joe has been doing a lot of travel.

Speaker 5:          02:28:26       He just sold out the Borgata casino in Atlantic city. That's not. Yeah. He wanted to come in and do a podcast to promote it and he's like, I don't even got to promote a dog hits already. Sold the fuck out. Everybody's killing it. It's Kinda crazy. Crazy to see how uh, how hard they're killing it on the road. Shows podcasts, killing it too. Then the comedy store, Holy Shit. That's back in the day. They had so many like hidden bars back there that collected dust, spider webs everywhere. Now all those back rooms are being used like the old days. It's insane. I've never, I mean I was hanging out at the comedy store all the Goddamn time with you for like two or three years straight. You come pick me up man. I come out your car, but either like, like the baddest car on the planet is like just waiting for me.

Speaker 5:          02:29:18       I'm out front. And those moments, you know, the reason I bring that up is last night after Ebi, me and my wife drove through my neighborhood and we went down my street. I got out of my car, I parked right in front of my house and I got on my car. I just wanted to look at it again. I mean, I was there for like 15 years and when I turned around and walked back to the car, dude and I went back to 2001 where you'd come and pick me up and we drive to the comedy store. Dude, I had that vision. I was just last night, man. It was, it was, it was insane. It was crazy at that all the goddamn time. And the comedy store the way it is now. Holy Shit. Tuesday night selling out, it stays. Fuck. That sounded almost every night.

Speaker 5:          02:29:56       Sometimes there was a main room was rarely used. It was just all about the alarm was struggling, it was struggling. And then when you left and you had that falling out for for awhile, then dude darkness. And then you come back, boom. It's like, it's like Jesus is doing stand up there now. You know what I mean? It's so packed and everyone loves it and there's lines outside. It's nuts. It's weird. Right? It's weird to see because you get to see it in the dark days. You got to see it. When I first started going down, which we weren't getting a lot of crowds. No, just the. Oh, and it's rarely that. It took like a few years of me going there, selling out sellouts warrant happening back then. Not many maybe of Dave Chappelle came by and did like a sad or something. Maybe another one talk or maybe on a Friday night it would sell out our Saturday night and the o are.

Speaker 5:          02:30:41       Yeah, but just the lr. Not like both of them. Can, you know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. And now it's nuts and every but all the managers like, hell yeah. This is all an insane. It's beautiful. It's a beautiful thing, man. It's crazy. It's the Internet to Internet and that opened the fucking place up. It's always been a big for texts were crazy people to something. That was something about that place. That guy was there last week. I'm Robert Apple. Your mom provided his name? Robert William App or via a lawyer. I'd like to talk to him like, you can't touch them. You can't touch them. You won't change. What's the store like? What does he say? Is he a, I don't know. I mean asperger's. He's got

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       something going on. There's some issues through some, uh, some sort of issue. He walked the documentary right now getting into that. Did you know that dude would do. He would put on a jacket and then he would put, he would stuff the jacket filled with plastic bags and walk in the rain. He's like a sort of a homeless kind of comedian who shows up place where he sleeps and he's got a place and he's been at the comedy store every week forever, every week. And he's always on. He's by himself. No one usually talks to them. Right. It's kind of a nice guy and he's all. His jokes are about marijuana. Does he have good ones? They're not bad. They're not bad. Oh, so he's a super weed. Got the. Oh yeah, it's all about weed. Everything's relaxed about weed. I didn't know that. You didn't know that.

Speaker 3:          02:32:03       I didn't know that. I never let his whole act is about marijuana. What does he say? Like, Oh, you don't have to go there and watch and watch. I wouldn't want to do as bits, but yeah, it's all about weed. That's crazy. I thought there's a lake. He was a lawyer. There's this documentary about this old lady who basically lives at a laundromat. She just like, just started hanging out there and super nice and started doing people's laundry and like the owner of the laundromat just like, let her live there. You know, she's just a homeless person. She was really sweet. Good. She's a, she's there all day. Clean it up and watch. He's like, yeah, I got free security. She's nice. I'm not going to throw her out. And she's helping everybody. Everybody loves her. And then, uh, they did a documentary on what she, her life. It's pretty fascinating, man. I'm Zach Galifianakis take has been taken. He's known her for years because she's like in Santa Monica and back when he was a struggling actor, he met her at the laundromat and he became friends with her. He takes her on red carpet. Premiers as this date, hooked her up there. They have a really close relationship. That's credit he takes. He takes her to legit red carpet, big ass movie premiers.

Speaker 3:          02:33:13       Zach's an interesting guy, man. He's real good friends with brody. Really? Brody was having some issues. He reached out because he know I'm friends with brody and just telling me like, Bro, he's not doing so good right now. Help out. Try to keep an eye on him. Don't, don't do anything. Nuts. Really easy. Uh, he's not doing standup anymore.

Speaker 4:          02:33:32       What does this remind me of the story I just heard the other day? So I'm looking at this video up. It's not brand new, which I thought it was brand new. This lady was living in this guy's addict for a couple of, I think a year and the way he found out as he put a camera in because he was finding food missing from his apartment. Like in this kitchen, this lady was living in his attic and climbing down when he was gone to like take it.

Speaker 3:          02:33:53       Shower food. I think it was a year. I want to say it might've been a little longer. It could have been a little less like 54 years old. This is like that movie, like it was in New York. We had this little stool there. Starts with a P. Whoa. A poltergeist? No, no. It's a paranormal activity. Is that all? This is crazy.

Speaker 6:          02:34:17       It's good to be fake. Look how quiet she. So she doing this while he's asleep. I think he was gone at work and she probably didn't want anybody to know that she's pissed in my sink. What the fuck is it? Videos. Timelapse a little bit to some. Skip it. Oh my gosh. She's sitting there and his dad, his whole apartment that we're looking at. Well this is just like this kitchen. You just put like a still camera in there when he went to work to find out what happened in the middle of the night to maybe, Whoa, hold on,

Speaker 7:          02:34:52       keep going with that. Keep going. That where is she? How did she get up there? Like she went back up? Yeah, exactly. How does she get back up? Yeah. Where did she go? That's him, right? That's him. There she is. Okay. So where does she go?

Speaker 6:          02:35:06       Did this guy to be fake? No Way. She could get up there. Let's find out how she does it. Oh Shit. Oh Shit. Oh. She hears him coming in and she runs and hides. Oh Wow. Yeah. It might have been the middle of the night. Oh my God. He got up in the middle of the night. She had a whole. How is she going to get back? How is she going to get back up there? Been doing it every night, but let's see it. Let's see it

Speaker 7:          02:35:30       do. That is insane. So he leaves. She comes back and that's it.

Speaker 6:          02:35:39       There's no shot of her going back. It was just right there. Okay, let's see that. Oh Shit. It's real too. She lives in his attic. That's insane. That's so

Speaker 7:          02:35:50       creepy. Would say the next morning, maybe the next morning. Didn't I say that at the very end of that video?

Speaker 6:          02:36:01       Does it say a video? How long has she was up there for

Speaker 7:          02:36:05       like how long had it been? I don't know. Was going back to the story. So you get the rest go like right when she pops up, go right back to that video please. And right when she pops up into the attic area. Go a little bit further back before when she scrambles up. Fine. When she scrambles up in there. I don't see it coming out the next morning. Yeah. Okay. Him saw him the next morning. And does he check the video and find out? Fuck man, you know creepy. That would be of your sleeping in the house and someone's in your God Damn Anik. And they climbed down while you're. While you're sleeping. They make themselves some food and they climb right back up there. That's like a little human rat.

Speaker 9:          02:36:47       Here's where she was staying.

Speaker 6:          02:36:49       What's your name and how long does it say? How long she was up there for? Do they know? Did she admit it? She in jail. She insists. It's actually her house.

Speaker 7:          02:37:00       He knocked and found a dark haired woman who said that Jimmy was letting him live there. He called the police, but the woman who fled before they arrived.

Speaker 6:          02:37:11       Wait. It's not unusual to what and it's a go back up a little bit. It's not unusual.

Speaker 7:          02:37:16       Oh, was it say, but one man was shocked to find a woman. I wonder how often that happens. It's not unusual to find unwelcome bats, squirrels or termites in the attic, but one man found a woman. Ooh, Jesus Christ. What does that

Speaker 4:          02:37:29       some other video started playing. Here's where she was. Wow. Apartment there, so she had like a little spot up there. If you look this up too, it's. This isn't an uncommon story. This happened a few times to other people. Oh Shit. They're just living in their fucking house.

Speaker 7:          02:37:47       Well, there's a lot of homeless people that eventually become squatters. That's a big problem with people to someone just set up shop and your house and start living there and cooking and bringing food home and they changed the locks and then they say, this is my house, and then you have to. You have to actually figure out some way to prove that it's your house. Then you didn't send it, you know, rent it to them or that you have to figure out a way to kick them out, kick their ass. When you thought about fucking what do you see someone living in your house, you're going to fucking try to go to court. If you look, let's say this side kick and randomly the not maybe me, but what if, what if? What if you're a guy that has a house in big bear. Okay, okay. And you're, you're not there very often and then you go up to big bear one day and the locks changed and some guys looking at through the window, can I help you? And you're like, this is my house. The fuck it is is my house. And you're like, what are you talking about? Why you in my house would you do to buy locks? Like the guys just squatter duty. Come back with some friends and you just fucked. Fuck this dude out. He's got a gun.

Speaker 7:          02:38:46       You come and go. He calls the police, the police show up. And the police like you breaking and entering like, no, this is my house. I know he lives here. Possession is nine tenths of the law. This gentleman's inside the building. I always heard that from kids. Possession is nine tenths of the law. What is there a fucking percentage of the law is the law. The law possession is nine tenths of the law. Is that real?

Speaker 7:          02:39:07       What? That's how it's hard to say what I would do. I saw something about it. Let them have the house. Some woman bought a house and right when she was about to move in some woman who had just moved in and she had been there for like two weeks and she changed the locks and she was like, someone leased it to me online. Like she said that someone online like was leasing this lady's house. Is it a scam or is it real? It could be a scam on both sides. Could be she's lying or it could be someone ran a scam on her and got her to pay rent for a house and she really thought it was hers could be. Right.

Speaker 4:          02:39:40       That's true. Totally. Was I think I was fooled what's up? Eddie called this video out properly being fake, I think. Which video? That video of the lady in the apartment. Oh yeah. Fake. I found a story. Apparently people are adding this video to that story. So yeah, this have another side. I just said that it was a marketing campaign for a rental website.

Speaker 7:          02:40:01       The Daily Mail UK put out a marketing campaign.

Speaker 4:          02:40:03       I mean, I'll show you a series of thing. How would they use that to get business? I said, this video is fake. It's a marketing campaign.

Speaker 7:          02:40:10       Oh, interesting campaign for what? We're making an apartment style. Damn fake news, man. Real fake news.com. Go Watch that shit. That's just like Blair witch. So much shit. I believe Blair witch. The first time I saw it, I thought it was really hard. Did you ever see the Bobcat Goldthwait Blair witch style movie? He made a boot and move about bigfoot willow creek. It's a Blair witch style bigfoot movie. It's pretty fucking good. If you want to get scared at the idea is that all those people that go missing in the forest, that's one thing where people go missing. That's legit. Like a ton of people go missing every year in the national parks, national parks and forests, they just easy, easy to pick them off their road, get Jack if there's a market for it, you don't think there's guys out there trying to make money. I think they're getting eaten by animals.

Speaker 7:          02:41:00       People are there in deep woods and they're falling down and breaking their leg and getting eaten by bears and shit. For sure. There's a lot of that. There's a lot of that. When you have someone that like if you're in the business, that's a good spot. Get people camping so I'll never see it. They're never going to investigate. They're going to say a bear took them. Yeah. Your Business. That would be. If that was your business, go and what's the easiest way? Right, but bears can't get people. I know. It's a poor guy that got perfect. Good. Just got jack the other day, woke up and his tent to the sound of his skull cracking because a bear with biting down on a skull. Oh, the kid that got killed. How often do every year kill people? Every year. Every year. Every United States. Every year someone's getting killed.

Speaker 7:          02:41:40       Many five. Couple for a couple. Two, three. Not that many. You know? A kid got killed at rutgers and then the most recent one, a kid got killed. He was in a road race in Alaska. It was racing like some track event and he was lagging behind and he saw a bear and the bear was going after him and he's like, he called his mom and said mom was bare following me and the bear jacked him, dragged him into the woods. They had to kill the bear. The bear was like, oh, hoarding. Like covering the body, like protecting it. Oh, they found the bear at. Because the mom sent someone out. Yeah, they found the fair. The found the bear guarding the body. Think it was his and he was going to eat it. How much they eat at that point for whatever he could get tore him apart though.

Speaker 7:          02:42:28       It's not a good way to go. No. How about that documentary with that crazy dude who timothy treadwell was one of the best documentaries ever. Grizzly man. The way it was setup to cause the first half of the documentary who really liked that guy like this guy really cares about these bears and all the sound bites that we're using from the multiple interviews that they took were all stuff that we're saying good things about them and you're like, oh, and then the slow it gets dark. It was just this crazy dude out there who's crazier and crazier and crazier as time goes on. When I love. When the pilot was it a pilot sheriff, grizzly man Grizzly, because it a pirate of the sheriff goes. I thought he was retarded setting lap though. It's funny

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       with bears, you can't be hanging out. He wasn't just hanging out with bears. He was hanging out with them deep into the late season were the only ones that were alive that weren't in hibernation where the starving ones, like he was in a danger zone. Like most of the time those bears, like if you're around bears that are eating salmon, you're not even in danger. They're just eating so much salmon. They don't want to try to chase you. Didn't even think of you as real. Yeah. There's an area that we, uh, was it the Kenai peninsula, that video that we showed where that huge bear wanders up to that dude. It's not even trying to kill him. It doesn't even care because there's like 30 bears on the stream and they're all just jack and salmon. They're eating so much salmon, but this bear lumbers up and it's like the size of a vw bus. It's so fucking big and this to just sit in there and this bears is just walks over with these dead button eyes. They have those black dead eyes. Oh, they're so creepy. I mean, they're beautiful in a lot of ways, but look at this thing. Look at this thing right up next to his lawn chair. Look at these things. Eyes.

Speaker 7:          02:44:15       This is an eating machine. That's what that is. That's like a pit bull times a thousand to thousand pounds eating machine

Speaker 7:          02:44:22       and they look so lovable. Yeah, of course. They look like your friends in the movies that talk. Well, what are you guys want to do to teddy bears? Should we go fusion? A lot of fishing going on here and so this guy's hanging out and it just starts walking towards him. I mean this thing is 10 feet from him and we're eating the bear. Yeah, eat bear black bear. What does it taste like? Like fuck the cow. Nice at this. This thing is just to get his nails. Look at those fucking clause. Holy Shit. The head on that thing. That is an enormous bet on this guy. This guy just freezing. Yeah, I mean he was taking pictures. He's a photographer and it shows it towards the end of the video and this guy was taking pictures of that river which is filled with bears filled with bears, eat and salmon, and this is just a full bear. He's full. So he says to the bear, hey, hey, look at the code. Just noise, just noise. Now look at that, look at it. We'll

Speaker 1:          02:45:24       get all the bears back up real quick. I'd want to see them look at this to do this. Look at this. Look when he turns, look at all these fucking bear. Holy Shit. There's so many bears. So this area, which is overwhelmed by bears, there's never been a death report it there. They don't kill people there because there's so many fucking salmon that they just gorge themselves on salmon and just chill out. But if they're hungry they'll fuck you up. I just figure you out. Like I could eat this dude. And then once they eat you that, well I can't believe I didn't need him before. That was easy. Like it's like we have this stupid idea that there's a contract. We have a stupid idea. Like there's some contract between us and bears know they're not going to fuck

Speaker 7:          02:46:10       us up. Well, they like us. We're cool. Most Times bears are scared of people. Is there a video of a bear and a lion fighting onshore? Right? Probably like China or something. If you had to put money on a full grown bear, grizzly bear or a lion, what do you think? I'm going with the lion all day. Yeah. I'm going to cat. They both have tremendous clause. Yeah. I'm going with the cat. He's more athletic. He moves better cats. Just fuck everything up. They fuck everything up. They fuck up. Crocodiles. You seen leopards? Jack Crocodiles, Jaguars, Jaguars. Greg, Greg, Jack, crocodiles. I bit leopards do too. Yeah. They just cancerous too fast. The two mean did the meanest of all the animals and they're one of the rare animals that only eats meat, like they only killed things. Like what do bears eat? Berries and she got a polar bear versus a great white shark.

Speaker 7:          02:47:01       I got to go with the shark. I think the barrel fuck up. The great white. I don't think he's going to be able to fuck them up in the water. They swim and swim that good. All right. Not that good. Oh, this is a mountain lion. A mountain lion bear. Yeah. Holy Shit. Them outlines, bite in the bear in the head and the bears like whatever. Bitch. Barely. This is amazing. I barely. Oh, so it's a female. It's a male bear and a female mountain lion that's guarding or cubs pair in the face. It's like, well, let's make a killer video. They just take this captured mountain lion and bear and they just, oh, that's ready to go at it. I think that's real. She's just trying to keep that therapy for the kids because if you just have cameras set up where a mountain lion activity is de, stay away, use a zoom lens.

Speaker 7:          02:47:48       There's a bunch of different ways. I mean, they've gotten a bunch of different really incredible encounters between animals just by filming hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours. You stay in the field for months at a time. You see things like, look at this lion and the bear. Those are some good camera angles, so get this, but that's a black bear. See someone set this up. That's a black bear and a lion. That's crazy. That's not a big bear. That's a small bear and a big line blind. Never lived together. Yeah. How would. How would they be in the same spot? Somebody put them together. No, no other way. Black lines are only in Africa. The pairs are only in North America. This one at least. Actually. Probably. They probably got some of those in Asia that looks similar. That looks like a zoo right? There. It is. As a. What the fuck is that animal? That's another one. Those two lines. Oh, he's about to get some. Oh, he's taking a shit. There's a bear in there too. Oh, the bear gets lead in later. Oh Shit. There's a bear right there. Oh fuck. Yeah. What's going on here? This is like some like a snuff film. Well they do shit like that in like other countries. Yeah. I've seen videos where they have betting matches. Look at this as barren. This line is like my food. That's a big ass black bear.

Speaker 6:          02:49:07       Take them, fight over the food. That's a thing. And doing over there. Just facing the eating something or eating something.

Speaker 9:          02:49:16       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:49:17       This is weird. I don't understand.

Speaker 6:          02:49:21       It's um, I think they're just go to back. What about a full grown chimp versus a tiger tiger all day. Really? Yeah. I got with the cat. You always go. I always go with a cat. Especially the cats. Bigger like a full grown cat can be like 900 pounds. Plus Hydros can swim, right? Yeah. Do they go into water? They could swim underwater. Yeah. Tiger versus great white. Great Light. You think so water. You don't always go for cats that I always go for cat, but the great white, so much bigger. Still a cat. There's a picture of a surprise. I think a tiger would take a fucking. They're taken out. Crocodiles, great. White. They're not smart. That's true. They try to eat cages and shit. I don't think they'd be able to do anything with it though. I don't think it's too much. It's like, you know, a real great whites, like a thousand pounds.

Speaker 6:          02:50:14       I went to Fox. That tiger going to do. Then it's swim with it and its mouth. They figured out that you could swim with all sharks. Now the sharks are like if it hit them at the right time or whatever, you could swim with sharks except for great whites, but there is one lady who swims of great white sharks. What is this? 15 foot, what is it? 14 or 15 foot. Great white like in three foot of water off the coast of Mexico. In this bay. It got. It got hit right here, but the propeller, but they found out it was feeding off Stinger race. It wasn't like beach journey thing. Oh really? Close to a dude. It's fuck. Where's this? That's why I was there. It wasn't there because it was stuck in there because it was feeding off sting range. If you watched the whole video, the guy that they're wondering if it's like caught in a net or what's going on with that.

Speaker 6:          02:50:58       He gets real close here. You can see this. This injury on its back. It got hit by propeller. I'm not going to show this online. If you want to look it up on Youtube. It's Pearson brothers winery films. Fifty yanked my views on it right now. It's A. Yeah. Whenever you try to put someone else's youtube video on your youtube video, you get yanked. Look at the scars on his back, so he all got. He got fucked up by a propeller. That's what happened. Now it also starts moving around too. I think I got a little fucking Harry. Wow. It's pretty dark. Wow. I guess size of that thing. I didn't know there were so dark. Well, it's probably just shitty lighting

Speaker 6:          02:51:40       or shitty. Scary. Scariest. Fuck. That looks like a great thing. Just an eating machine. There's been a bunch of videos that are really crazy to watch. Where they take a drone. They flied over Malibu and you see these people surfing and just a few hundred yards outside. People surf. When you see a great white water. No, we're in Malibu. Oh Shit. Ooh. Yeah. That guy's in the water right next to that thing. Got Woken at it. He got hit by a sting right twice in his foot. One was like a six inch gas. He said, oh Jesus. So there must be like a school, a stingray singly jacked his foot. Oh fuck man. What are you doing? We retarded. Get out of their kid. Fucked up. Step it on sting rays. You fuck like you accidentally step on them, right? Don't they like bury themselves in the sand? Is there video of that? Drove Filming Malibu?

Speaker 7:          02:52:29       Yeah. Pull. Uh, pull up a great white spotted off of southern California coast.

Speaker 6:          02:52:36       Look at that now. This is Malibu? Yes. Pismo beach. It says. Okay. That's pretty close. That's a couple hours up the coast. There's a gang of them. And are they great white sharks there? Yeah, they think it's a great white when they get real big,

Speaker 7:          02:52:55       there's a, there's a quite a few videos that they're catching drones. One of them, they had people real recently. They evacuated the beach.

Speaker 6:          02:53:06       Sad. Oh Shit. Oh fuck the wave. It's right there. It's right there with everybody. You know what? They should have those patrolling the beach. The other one right now. He has no idea. Isn't that crazy? It's right there. Oh fuck. He's just waiting. Wave. And that is right underneath them. Are you kidding me? Fuck all that. He has no idea. He has no idea. And what does that thing? And then he's gone. He's gone a bit of a bitch. You sharks all the time. They were about to go on some surfer and then they take a fucking wave and he saved his ass. Do they probably are near death often. Those guys are so gangster guys like Kelly slater and. Yeah, fuck that. Dorian job's fucked it up for me, man. Joe. I know that's brainwashed. All that. But it worked. I was brainwashed as a movie. This

Speaker 7:          02:54:08       was about, you know, when it was a, what the inspiration was some real shark. That was real shark attack in freshwater. It's real crazy. There's a, there's a shark, a bull shark that swims from the ocean up rivers into fresh water and can get as far north as Illinois and then the most aggressive sharks day and they killed a bunch of people in a river in New Jersey. Yeah, I think it was like the early 19 hundreds, I want to say like the 19 thirties or some shit. They killed a bunch of people in our fresh water river in New Jersey, so these people would be swimming. Hey, let's go swimming. All right. Everybody, and they didn't know shit back then and then just see. Just just get torn apart by sharks. I think it had happened. Uh, where's that one? Indiana side of the Ohio River, the Indiana side of the Ohio River.

Speaker 7:          02:54:55       And they catch a fucking bull shark. Do you? Not Crazy. That is that thing. Got All the way up the river in fresh water. They're the only shark that we know that can do that. And Weird. Weirdly, it's one of the most aggressive sharks. I don't think we know of any other sharks that go up. Fresh water like that. Right? It's not the only one. I think that's the only one to travel up rivers. They have been known to travel as far up as Indiana in the Ohio River. Although I've been recorded attacks, they're probably responsible for the majority of nearshore shark attacks, including many attacks attributed to other sharks and see if he could find the inspiration for the movie jaws, Shark attacks in New Jersey. Because it was all in fresh water. That's what's fucked up about it. It wasn't even like the movie jaws where it was actually in the ocean. Like these people had no idea that. No idea. Nineteen 16.

Speaker 7:          02:55:51       Imagine all that. People were like babies back then. They didn't know shit. They just landed on the coast of America. Nineteen 16. How long you've been there? You know? 17, 76 to 1916. People just got their no airplane there. A hundred years. Yeah, it's crazy. Like thanked 1916 in 2017 when you can sit back and think about it. Nineteen 16 was essentially a 100 years ago. One hundred one years ago and just a hundred years before that you got 18, 1600 years before that you got 17. 16. So it's like the beginning of the country still hunt couple of hundred years into the beginning of the country and that was just 100 years ago. Great. White Shark attack. Five people near the Jersey shore. Huh? This is a different story. Unless they called it a great white shark and it was a bull shark. Is that.

Speaker 7:          02:56:44       I think that's different. I think that's a different story. There was a bunch of attacks on a river in New Jersey in the early 19 hundreds. I don't think that's the one. I think that's a different one. There's obviously been a bunch of attacks spring lake and into twin creek zen. It rode great white. But uh, but the one that's a great wide. Huh? That's different. I thought it was a bull shark. That's just what this says. Hmm. What's, when's the story from the stores? Is Nineteen Sixteen, 2012. Well, if it's in the Smithsonian, you gotta think that's probably right. I could've swore it was bull sharks though. And it killed more than one person either way. Fuck sharks, right?

Speaker 7:          02:57:28       Yeah. I don't fuck with the ocean. Do you go fishing? No, no, I didn't do it. Now I'll probably get into it for my son. I'll probably get into it. He likes it, but I ain't trying to go way out in the ocean. I have no desire and it goes. I like watching it on dvds and shit the deep. And you know that the deepest part of the ocean, like, I forget what it's called, James Cameron, where he goes down that submarine. There's like A. There's like a trench. Yes. I like shit like that. There's a lot of mysterious shit that goes on there. Do you know where the best place to go? Shark fishing in the world is South Africa right off. Catalina really did. It's one of the best in the world. They catch these giant Maaco sharks and they taste good. You can eat them for those people get mad at you though.

Speaker 7:          02:58:07       That's a new thing. People get mad if you. If you eat sharks, if you kill sharks, he will get mad. Yeah, they shouldn't be mad at that. But they, they don't get mad if you killed like a tuna. Tuna's okay. But sharks are bad because people have been brainwashed into thinking that people eat shark fin soup and they waste the shark. So then people start thinking of shark fishing. Like they think of trophy hunting. I think of like killing lions or something like that. You're just killing it for no reason. You're not eating it like they don't realize they go shop for food you like, nobody does a Japanese do now they just kill them. They kill them because they're getting in the way of their tune and production to the trailing the eight and they make Dolphin Burger's really? Yep. Ooh, seems wrong. They trap them in a cove and just fucking Harpoon into math.

Speaker 7:          02:58:53       When they were doing that, they were just killing them because they were getting in the way of their tune. That only shit. They're not going to just waste that. That set. Have you watched? I've seen a documentary. It could be bullshit, but seem legit, but isn't it weird? It feels weird, right? Like eating a, eating a dolphin seems fucked up. The Japanese, like they were totally into killing whales all the time. Or do they still do whaling? Yeah, that's pretty fucked up. Right? Definitely. They use it for all kinds of stuff, right. They would eat the whale blubber, you know, one of the things they do now, they, um, they should kill whales under the false pretense of a. they're trying to do scientific research that allowed to do some scientific research on whales, so they kill a few whales and then they take those whales, they kill and they sell whatever parts.

Speaker 7:          02:59:41       Smart gangster. The illuminati. I'd be like green, like that shit. That's a good one. I think it's a little monotony. I think it's a Japanese fishing market that's always been doing that. They've been selling and buying and killing whales forever, and so then when these new environmental standards got raised, they said, oh yeah, well we have to do a little research you to do a little research. Perfect. Those that company or that group, the sea shepherds, do you know who they are? They're the ones who bust people who were wailing in illegal whaling because otherwise you gotta think you find some whaling boat in the middle of the fucking ocean. Think I begged the goddamn ocean is there's a boat out there somewhere in the middle of it that's whaling. How are you going to find them? What are you gonna? Do they go out there and ram these boats and they'd shoot like air guns or something like that?

Speaker 7:          03:00:25       Don't like water, water, guns. They do a bunch of shit to try to disrupt it and then they try to expose. Isn't there a TV show about it? Think so. Whale warriors or some point. They shouldn't be fucking with whales and dolphins. Yeah, they're too smart and I was okay. Cows. Okay. Chickens or cows or dom. Hey chicken. Not that gum. Have you seen those videos of the cows that they kind of loose? Yeah, they get. We're in a slaughterhouse. They send them like they're smarter than we think. What about octopus? Also? Definitely happy. And you go to some restaurants and you can eat a live octopus. He just boil them. That's fucked up. Tying restaurant. They had it on the menu last night. Grilled Octopus of how we've talked about it on the podcast. They're smart as fuck. They are smart as fuck, but you know, look at that.

Speaker 7:          03:01:12       They're smart. It's going to go through a whole lot of tiny little tiny asshole. Right? Where's the hole? The hole in the wall. I got obsessed with octopus videos for law. I want more. I want, I want. They've got a poor fuck NASA and $18,000,000,000 put some more money into octopuses octopuses dolphins, monkeys. Whereas that thing going out the boat. Whoa. Is going through that hole in the wall. Yep. Right out the side of the boat. Why I get that shit. That's an alien life form. I mean I might as well be from another planet. Yeah. Have you found that on another planet? You'd be so excited. She the one that guy released it into the water and it like came up and it said it came up to thank him. Look at that shit. It's hard to tell if that was piling out of that crack too slowly. That head com impressing itself had the brand and everything that has to worry about is the beak. I don't think they have like a classic brain like we think of. Look at that. That's nuts. Through a little tiny hole right at the end of it. Scoop it up with a net psych.

Speaker 7:          03:02:16       He tried too hard, but I saw a common bitch. It's crazy. Eat Octopus. Yeah. Damn. I think dad does too. I don't think there's some octopus attack. Yeah, I don't think they're nice north. I think Canada, they're worried that were assholes and they're probably right, but I don't think there's a lot of morals going on the octopus community. Do you ever see that one video of octopuses that were taken out? Sharks in an aquarium. They had this big ass aquarium. They kept missing sharks. They're like, what the fuck is going on? Like someone's killing our sharks and then they put a video. They set it up and I found that the octopus always get busted with cameras. Right. There's so many hidden camera videos like pet octopuses getting out of their aquarium. Oh yeah. And going into another aquarium, a jack in the fish and then climbing back in.

Speaker 7:          03:03:02       Look at this. Do they attack each other as attack each other? That's a very good question. Octopus wars. I'm sure they have them. Right. Look how he fucks. This shark doesn't have a chance. It's a tiny shark. It is a baby. It's like a toddler still doesn't have a chance. Do you know that they feel like they're pretty sure that they found fossil evidence of enormous suction cups, which would indicate that at one point in time there was a thing like a cracking, like an enormous hundred foot long octopus. I believe that the private I'd probably still exists probably. Right? We don't know shit about the ocean. Will you see those giant squids right here? She knows. Yeah. You ever seen that one? They found when they had one of those offshore, uh, offshore oil, uh, things. One of those things. Do they have it on Youtube? Giant squid. What's that? Offshore oil rig. Alien Squid or the biggest, the biggest squid. They found this fucking square. That one. They didn't

Speaker 6:          03:03:58       even know this thing existed until they had a camera set up and look at that fucking thing. It's got like crab legs. They found this enormous giant squid in the ocean. They didn't even know it existed until they got this video look. A pig. That shit. It's huge. It's like it has like a mom's like, go back to that image Jamie and freeze on it. Like it's hard to tell. We did something like a boat next to it or it's hard to tell how big it is. Well, they've caught them. They've caught giant squid now. The giant squid used to be like a rumor. They used to find dead ones occasionally, but now that's thrown them and caught them. Yeah, it's huge man. What it looks like an alien. Like that thing looks like an alien. Like liquid is like crab, like legs where it bends.

Speaker 6:          03:04:42       I want to how smart pr they should do. Some experiments. Some giant squids. Maybe they're just stupid. Octopus are smart and they're just good for Sushi there. Make a hell of a Sushi. Tell you that. I liked squid Sushi like it. You don't like Sushi? I don't like seafood at all. I like to. I like canned tuna. Sardines no fucking way. I said Shit. Ever Oysters? Hell no, but I do like. I do like black cod or is it black cod gets from the east. It's like racist. I see what it says. I don't like. White is black cod. They serve. It tastes like candy. I like that. So I know what you're talking about. You're talking about like me, so cod. Yeah. I don't know if it's me. So I think it's called black cod. Yeah, black cod with like a miso dressing. So a lot of Asian restaurants here.

Speaker 6:          03:05:28       I love that. It tastes fishy. Like Salmon. I don't like that shit. Trout a really not into. I don't know man. You met under very different taste. I wish I wasn't do it. God Damn you don't even. She sounds so much fun. Like what am I showing? Gives me organ meat. Liver. So good for you. I want shit that doesn't remind me that it's used to be an animal living. No desire. That's why like Mcdonald's, because I know that shit ain't meet eventually, but if you were on a farm, have you are on a farm and the only way to eat you had to shoot a cow and butcher it and grind it up. How would you handle that? Because you do it. I'd get used to it. You get used to it. I'm sure I would. If I had to eat. I was starving.

Speaker 6:          03:06:12       You Go Vegan or would you just kill the cows? What was the choice again? Go Vegan. I'm going to get all your food from the farm I got to get. Okay. Yeah. Let's say if like we're in some, like a day of the dead fucking. I'd had chicken night of the living dead chickens walking dead Zombie scenario to kill chickens. Chickens. No problem. No problem. No problem. Um, you wouldn't kill God. Put chickens on the planet for us. I think animals eat other animals, right? It's true. That's what we do every day with deciding sleep chickens out there for the people. Man. I can't believe the dogs. And then like, Oh shit, what the fuck? Chinese people. You have a festival

Speaker 3:          03:06:56       which is eating dogs. How about the Indians think I. cows are sacred and we. And they must think we're fucking crazy. Well, certain parts of India, right? What does that, is it just the Hindus? The think that I think most India. What do you think that's from? Just culture. Mushrooms maybe for sure. Oh, that's right. For sure. So this grows out of cow shit. It only grows out of cows. Jet Predominantly. Really? Yeah. Dan, we can find it in field to get a couple of cows. Chickens, Shit, dude, are you kidding? You make your own mushrooms. You can get your own mushrooms. Mushrooms. That's right. All easy to guess. You buy kits, you know? What do you mean your closet. You know that conspiracy theory that, that Mcdonald's doesn't actually use real meat, you know, some people call it, but some people believe it and it's easy to believe eventually it's gonna come out that they're not.

Speaker 3:          03:07:46       They're using some other kind of Shit fillers or whatever that it's already admit they use some sort of filler. Yeah, but they're not. They're not admitting that they're not using meat. That Mcdonald's has never said. We don't use meat. Hold on. What the mcrib what do they say? That same compound that they say is using yoga mats or something that fake rubber come, come on, but they're not. Mcdonald's is not out there saying, hey, we don't use real meat. They're saying 100 percent beef. Dude. I just got commercials. Yeah, but they don't say that for about the a day saying $100, but here's a conspiracy theory is that hundred per 100 percent beef is actually just the name. It's a trademark. Oh, that's right. I don't know if that's real. I read that. So when they say 100 percent beef, that's just the name of the company that makes the beat.

Speaker 3:          03:08:31       I read that. That was, that's the ultimate mind. Fuck right there, right. You know what they do? All they need to do is little by little. Say Yes. We don't use. We don't use first. They have a, a, a, a fake meat Vegan Burger. Yes. Fake me and slowly tell people inch by inch that. Oh yeah. We don't use real mean brill. Meat's bad for you. It causes cancer. Why would we're we're helping you. We're trying to save you. If you don't want to eat meat. I feel like that was shut down. I think 100 percent real beef was like shut down like that. They were trying to make a product called 100 percent real beef. What a sneaky fucking loophole. What kind of shocked. Yeah, no I'm not, but what kind of a monster would do that create a fake meat and call it a 100 percent real beef and that was the name of the meat, like you know, what's your dog's name?

Speaker 3:          03:09:19       Oh, my dog's name is 100 percent real beef. Like just naming it right? You just make it a name. That's so fucking sneaky. Is that true? I don't know. It could be a. It could be a myth. It's not true. Jamie, same listeners into subway, Newsweek, McDonald's, Mcdonald's. Try to copyright the term 100 percent real beef and use it on, on Patty's that weren't just all beef. I think they did. I feel like someone did that. I don't know if it was Mcdonald's, but I feel like you're right. I feel surprised if it's true, but it could be a hoax.

Speaker 1:          03:09:54       I remember it. You know, it's hard to tell what's real these days. We can look on snopes, but nobody trusts them anymore. It was false, but I won't. I'll find another source. What a snopes. Can't trust false. What do they say about what's. What's caused the rumor mill? Snopes is and what's false? They're saying, don't do this, don't do it. Don't do it. You can wait. You're hungry or you train it again. How's your back?

Speaker 5:          03:10:18       My knees fucked up. It popped out again. Saturday I did a seminar in oceanside, 10 panadols and strategy side and it fucking popped out again. I was on the floor and then this time I was like, I can't squat down for a long time because I was squatting down giving Kyle bame a brown belt out there. He's, he's a bad ass grappler. I was just giving him some hot rubber guard advice while I was squatting on the balls of my feet and you're on the balls of your feet and it blew out there and I went. When I stood up, that's how blood originally and when I stood up the thing popped out and I'm like, Oh shit. Coming in. I was in serious pain and then I straighten up my leg and it popped back in. Man, I'm going to need surgery because the doctor said for six weeks because that happened six weeks ago and the doctor said, make sure you don't do anything stupid on it for the next six weeks because if it pops out again, my acl was hanging on by a thread. It's probably all gone now. That's probably all gone. My knees fucked up so I'm going to need surgery. I'm just going to do it, but meanwhile I'm just going to lift hard. I'm just gonna. Make sure while my knees recovering my upper body as strong as hell.

Speaker 1:          03:11:25       Dr Mcgee, Dr Rodney Mcgee. Yeah, I talked to him. He didn't have a new way of attaching the acl where they don't have to give you a cadaver graft anymore. When did you talk to them?

Speaker 5:          03:11:34       Uh, before it popped out again. So I need to talk to them again.

Speaker 1:          03:11:38       This is what they're doing now. They're, they're changing the recovery times drastically because the old way, what they do is they take a cadaver graft, right? So they'd take a piece out of a dead guy or they'd take your hamstrings, Patella the Patella. Don and I had to get the advert done. What's better? You think the cadaver but the cadaver it can get infected and then it gets real. I've never heard of that APP. That's a problem. I haven't had it happen to me. Mine was. Mine went super smooth. I did all my rehab. I did a good job of the Rehab. I was. DABBING is good. It's great. It's great. My cadaver knee doesn't bother me even a little. You had acl? Both directions. Both. Both. Holy Shit. Yeah. And you see what I can do. My legs. What year? [inaudible] 94 with the Patella tendon graft. Two thousand three with the uh, acl with the counselor when I got.

Speaker 1:          03:12:23       That was when I got my biggest when I'm was the first one was done with the Patella graphs that a hamstring? No. And then the second one in 2003 was done. Cadaver Cadaver? Yeah. In both knees are good. Oh yeah. They don't pop out? No. Did it pop out? Is that how it ripped before slid out it? Well, the first one felt um, I, I tore it kicking the bag. I was tired and I was doing rounds on the bag and I threw a kick and my leg was planted and it didn't. My foot didn't pivot. I was just doing rounds, was real tired. I was trying to put it out exactly. And I was 21 and I think I'd heard it before then I just didn't realize how bad I'd heard it. And then I heard it again. It popped like I felt it explode in the gym and then I went to the hospital and they checked it out and the whole deal.

Speaker 1:          03:13:06       And, and uh, I've eventually got it fixed. And then the other one. No, you know what? I heard it a couple different ways. But Anyway, point is it, it blew out. Um, my second one that I got done, it was introduced to class. I was in half guard, I was on top and someone had the lock down sideways. So instead of straightening me out normal, like, you know where your leg bends and extends it hyper extends, it went this way, like against the side of the knee. And it just was a weird angle and he straightened his leg out and it just popped up. You can hear it snap like a carrot snap. And I didn't even know it was broken. I thought it was just really painful. And then the next day I was actually walking around. Okay. And I didn't think anything was wrong. I thought it was just really sore.

Speaker 1:          03:13:50       And then I was moving some stuff around in my office and it just went. It just fell out of the socket. Slipped out, gave out? Yeah. Just gave out. And I knew that feeling before because of my other knee. And then did you have to straighten it out and pop it back in? No, it didn't. That wasn't a problem because it wasn't. There was no meniscus tear on the right one. The left one had meniscus tear as well. Remember? One time I blew that out in class and I was like, my leg locked. Do you remember that? And you had to drive my car.

Speaker 5:          03:14:14       Forget that he drove me to the doctor and driving your Nsx, a stick shift. And I was grinding the gears. Your knee was tore apart. You were like, you're fucking piss driving, you know, because your knee and I'm fucking up your car and you're like, what the fuck are you doing? Don't you go to fucking driver's stick? I'm like, dude, I haven't driven a stick and forever it's sticks. Sticks to the easel about automatics, baby. It's 2017 and people would still got sticks. What the fuck is going on? All my cars and. Come on man. I love sticks. I supposed to text. I don't know. I'm kidding. That's not a good job.

Speaker 1:          03:14:51       Yo. Yo. Yo. Get in. Wrecks. Protects stage. Do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How many people have been in wrecks while they're facetiming? I saw some good face time and on the highway. I've seen a couple people do it. Facetime and while they're driving him, I'm gonna. Give you that sweet Dick Mama Way. Yeah. That's incredible. I love driving stick shifts though. I prefer it.

Speaker 5:          03:15:10       I don't like it. Maybe you would like it if you drove a sports car. Why don't you get one of those engines that you crank like in 1910 and you liked that you control the anymore. If they made them, you would get them maybe what have you had to start your car by cranking? Yeah, but you don't feel like there's some fun and shifting the gears. I know what it was like, you know, what it was, is my first car was a 1977 pinto station wagon and I got it for $550 and it was a stick shift. I always wanted, uh, the cheaper cars were always stick shift. I could only afford to stick shift. The more expensive cars had the automatic. And I guess it was just, I was

Speaker 7:          03:15:49       brainwashed into thinking, fuck, one of these days I'm going to be able to drive an automatic fuck this bag. You will bullshit. And I think it was just a mind fuck. So once I was, once I got my first automatic car, Mike Fox stick shift, you could just, I had a bunch of automatics and then I got a stick shift. I had a bunch of muscle cars and then I got an Audi. Fox is a tiny little Audi car. It was a little front wheel drive car and it was a stick shift. It was like a zippy little car like me. I loved it. I was like, Ooh, I love like shifting the gears, but it wasn't until I got my first NSX, Nsx, Nsx in 95 or six, maybe 97, 97 and then I had another one that I got in like 2004. It was a bad ass car.

Speaker 7:          03:16:40       Love those things. They're so different now. Now the new NSX is like this big technological spaceship thing. I like it. It's dope. It's going. I don't think so, but it's a different thing. I liked. I liked the little cars that you can. You're, you're in control of like a, like A. I don't like the big electronic car. That's why I like the Porsche because that thing's light. It's light and you control everything. You feel it. You feel the road like, like if you're in a sports car for me, like a fast car, you want to feel everything. Makes it exciting. You don't get any of that Shit, I dunno. Maybe don't even like liver or was that. You don't even like liver. Like you and I are very different. Oh No, no, I didn't let you sliced hearts. There is an Nsx that looks incredible leadership.

Speaker 7:          03:17:25       It's already out. Oh yeah. Not only is an out. They just released an Nsx gt three, so if you want to race, if you want to be a racecar driver, they'll sell you one of those and it costs a half a million bucks. Holy Shit. It's a beast of a car man. And the thing is, it's a Honda. I'm going to call it an Acura, but it's a Honda, which means is this not going to break? You could drive that thing forever. Those things will have unbelievable reliability as opposed to like say a car that my ancestors made. You know, you get something Italian, good luck. But is it really Japanese? If they're making it in Mexico as they megan that Mexico, don't they make Honda's in Mexico? Toyota's. That's what I thought. Then. I know they make some of them in America. They make nissans and that's even worse. Really.

Speaker 7:          03:18:15       That's a good question. Right? Is it considered. Now we're talking about breaking down. There's a awesome American cars, but yeah, but if they just use standards developed by the Japanese and once they have standards developed by the Japanese, like what does it say? I'm making them in Ohio, Ohio. Oh, that's right. The NSX is being made in Ohio. That's right. I forgot about that. Is that good or bad? Was real good for Americans in Ohio. We want a good job making sex as far as a reliability. You know what? Everything's automated now. See that's the thing. It's not like you're. You're dealing with skilled craftsman. You're dealing with programmers and shit, but like assembly line should have some. There's some. That was the thing about the corvette factory in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Like those people, they've put together those corvettes by themselves. Like there's a lot that's going on that's a animated automated rather.

Speaker 7:          03:19:05       But there's a lot that's going on by hand to get this shit. This is crazy. They're making cars. So what is this guy doing right here with this thing? The factory, I don't know, I just kind of skipped ahead. Yeah. What's happening here? It's hard to tell what it is. They're flipping the thing upside down. Oh, they're working on the chassis. This is the bottom of the car. These things are just what they are now. That's what the car looks like on the inside before they put the seats in the drive train and all that stuff, but with these things are now it's all done by these robots. Someone controlling it real time or is it on a program? It's a good question. I would bet it's probably on a program. There's probably someone controlling it, but they're probably just pressing start it. Probably lock it into place and this thing, I mean the way it's stacking everything, hold on.

Speaker 7:          03:19:49       Some of the things that they're doing now though mean these cars are so precise. They're so different than anything that existed like 20, 30 years ago. Like this car, it might not be like the most, the fastest, best engineered cars in the world, but it's one of them and it's just that the horsepower wars are so out of control right now that a car like this is almost kind of overlooked because there's so many insane high performance cars now. I mean there's so many that are zero to 60 in three seconds. What they're doing now is just making these unbelievable spaceships that are regular person could buy. If you have the money. You don't have to be a race car driver. You don't have to be like super qualified to handle this thing. You could just get a car that's 600 horsepower, four wheel drive drives like a demon.

Speaker 7:          03:20:43       I mean you could just go out and buy it. The Tesla, the model three, it's like 35 grand, right? Crazy. Yeah. You're buying a model three, oh, you're buying a fucking spaceship. Like everything is automated. This guy's a using torque wrenches that everything's all set to the exact amount you're supposed to crank. Things like everything is. Nothing is left to the imagination. You know? It's cool to make like an old classics, like a new version, like the charger and all that. Yeah, yeah. Do model t's in a new version. They, those things are so like ergonomically clumsy and so poorly designed in terms of like aerodynamics and shit. If you try to take a model t on the highway, that shit would just fall over. Like once you got to like add, make it right though. But the wind resistance, you get to like 80.

Speaker 7:          03:21:29       You're not trying to go fast. It's just like a, like a Harley. Oh, like a cruiser, right? Yeah. Maybe. I mean they, they go, they had those cruisers that, those fifties type cars. Right? Like dragster things. What are they called? Pt cruisers. Oh yeah. That thing, that thing was, I drove one of those ones there were so bad. It was like you guys just made a cool outside and through the shittiest suspension you could. It was so bad, like every time I go around a corner the ass and would like kick out and I took it on a dirt road and I was like, I could fly off the side of this road and not being able to control this piece of shit. Right. Oh, those were pretty dope. That was the PR plymoth prowler. Is that like based on like a fifties style car? Sort of. That was created by chip foose. He's the guy that did the design element of my 1970 Barracuda who's a wizard car designer guy. He invented a bunch of different cool cars. They had that thing that plymoth prowler and there was another one that was kinda like that too, wasn't there. It was in another one of those fucking retro looking things. Either you don't have kids. If you have a car like that or you're a shitty father, that's your weekend car. What? Take my weekend car and driving around the neighborhood.

Speaker 7:          03:22:45       See your super rich and you can do that every now and then you put it in your side garage. That's the thunderbird. I think foose was involved in that too, guys. Goddamn car wizard. Yeah. That's a nice one. Is that a falcon? No, that's a t bird. That's a. that's a thunderbird, but it has a roof on it. Have they made newer versions of Falcons? Hm. I don't think so. Was the last time at mit a falcon in the sixties? Look at that thing above. It was that. Does that, that movie from that movie? Christine, that one on the right. The second one on the right. The Red One? Yeah. Look at that. What about cars like they should make? No, that's a thunder road. Look at that thing. God. What about new cars like that? Like those look like the limousine that JFK was in.

Speaker 7:          03:23:27       Right? Just a little shorter. That's a thunderbird. Look how bad ass that is. That's like if you roll around on that and Hollywood like if you're some sort of Rockstar type character and you got a Goddamn and you're like, look at me, motherfucker, look at this shit. Look at my white walls. Look at that thing and that is a slick ride. Go back to that last one jamie. That is a slick looking car man. What year is that? It's a for Thunderbird, right? Second Generation. Second Generation. That means if I had to guess, I'd say that's like 1960 something. Right. Crazy looking cars. Like they figured it out. They back then man, they had just caught a design groove and figured out how to make these really exotic looking sexy shapes. Fifty nine. Wow. Amazing. What a car. There's a lot of remixes possible here for Florida and are wondering should they do that or should they? They did that two charges and it was a huge grand slam. Have you seen the new m four that got now the Ford Gt, the new Ford Gt. Jesus Christ Ford's came out with a car that's like a Super Ferrari looking car. Let me say it.

Speaker 6:          03:24:44       I think it's like $300,000 for that thing. Yup. That's a Ford. Come on. Holy Shit. Holy Shit. It's about God damn time. They could have did that a long time ago. I get that thing. They should have did that 20 years ago. That's. See, that's like whatever the NSX is, 450, $3,000. You need to get one of those. Oh, come on. It's not even a standard. You got an automatic transmission and shit. The old ones, these dev stick to old for the dad. What the hell? That's the only 3 million bucks. It's gold plated. One driving down sunset. Why not? If I had one of those I never played and I would have like three d videos of my dick that like play all over the car. It's like you're. You're a hard dick. Is like a Hologram on led screens that are all over the car.

Speaker 6:          03:25:35       Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. Imagine if a dude drove down the street and he had a Bugatti with like the outside of the car was a screen. What did they make? Only one dick was a $3 million. It's got 1500 horsepower. It's a status symbol. It's one of those things where people want to show everybody that they don't even give a fuck. They drive around a $3,000,000 car, whether it's got a gang of them, but ace hood has a song called I will go bed and I woke up and I saw one drive down by the comedy store once and everybody looked, oh, that's a million dollars. That's a million dollars. It used to be a million. Now the three used to be. That was for the first million dollar car, so a million dollar car. Look at this. My book is for sale for 4 million for that neighborhood.

Speaker 6:          03:26:22       That's fully. Meanwhile, money made, whether it's in the dupont registry, he's selling it for fucking 4 million. You want to be a baller. Want to drive around and floyd mayweather. He does that often. He flips cars. Are you kidding me? Money buy a for to sell it for, for not only that, it's a good movement. It's a smart move, right? Cars. Are you kidding with social media? He says he's his own corporation. Yeah, no, it's a smart move. What's that? He's pissed over low ball bids. That is Bugatti auction in his face. He's a man. One point five, one point $9,000,000 bid, because the number was still much lower than floyd was hoping to get. I wonder what he paid for. It didn't sell. Somebody offered one point $9 million. He's like not enough. Whoa. Reportedly paid three point $5 million. Oh my goodness. So it was reported he was expecting to make a profit and someone tried to short them.

Speaker 6:          03:27:16       The same one. Now this is the white one. The one we just saw was the black one. Oh, okay. Yeah. The only people that could afford that or people don't give a shit about that. Well, I think floyd is just. His whole thing is about just being the oldest baller guys, guys, guys that are in the memorabilia there usually broke. They don't have that much money. Come on. That's not a memorabilia thing. One hundred people on the planet could have, could afford to do that. You know what I mean? And they're not impressed by having someone celebrity. You know what I mean? They are. It's more than 100 millionaire. A billionaire is going to be going to be treated that it's a floyd mayweather, his car, but it's obvious that it's flipping it like they're too smart for that shit, but if they wanted to get it and drive around and let everybody know in 2013 it says they sold their 400th day. Ron Jesus. So 400 people have bought go out of 400. Over a million dollars. Jesus, that's a lot of money. Four hundred million dollars at cars. I wonder what it costs to actually make. What do you think? 50 Bucks and it cost like $20,000 in my house. Okay, let's get this. I bet this a website that shows how much does it actually cost to build a Bugatti? I want to say $300,000. I'm going to say

Speaker 6:          03:28:36       because it's so expensive that the people making it will charge more. You know what I mean? Because it's probably going to be

Speaker 6:          03:28:45       $300,000. Oh, you agree with me? What did you say? I said $300. Wait a minute. Oh, I ripped. Perfect. Well, we'll see if we're right. We'll see if for both. Right? I think that's a reasonable reasonable thing to imply. For Volkswagen loses six point two $5 million on each one. They sell what Volkswagen loses. What? Wait a minute. They lose 6 million when they sell it for 3 million, so it costs $9. Million to make. I'm looking. There are lying now. There's never. You would never know. I'm going over to Eddie Bravo side on this one. Tower. This tower seven. No bullshit. Call Me Illuminati. Illuminati. Slamming this guy with a friend of mine was illuminating. Do people get tired of talking conspiracy theories with you? Do they get tired? No. They always want to bring it up and hide it. Usually a good thing to talk about, a good way for a young guy to approach you.

Speaker 6:          03:29:39       Hey Eddie, I'm with you on Tarceva. I'm with you with the flat earth, Bro. Hey Bro. Check it out. Lights you see? Pretty freaked me to the guy a guy came up to me with is like 12 year old daughter and they were all like that all into flat earth. Twelve year olds and I go, do you talk about flat earth at school? She goes, now they all think I'm crazy. When I wanted to just give her the benefit of the doubt into it. Hey, is it really that much money? Here's the other cars that sit there in a 17 year low with European cars. Well, there's lots of the last makers. There's the biggest one. It says smart cars. Those are pieces of shit. It's quite different vehicle $4,000 because of the economy. They could be going into like the development costs and like all the money that had to spend testing everything fucked right now. Right. Vw is fuck because they got caught lying. I think I caught lying about a fuel emissions or. Yeah, about uh, the fuel mileage of their

Speaker 7:          03:30:40       cars. And it's also about the missions now. Apparently they'd just been lying about that shit for a long time. Stuff like who's telling the truth anywhere. Like when it hit that level at the super crazy high level, they try to sell cars to. They're like, how do we sell these cars? People don't give a shit. Just tell them whatever study, say you know, science report, say just whatever you have any desire to drive around in some ball car. Fuck yeah. I'm not though. I have like one, one, $500, million of the money you have. I don't, I'm, I'm not. I'm driving a Tundra Tundra. Good fucking car. I like it. Those get Toyota trucks. I got it from my favorite shit for my baby. I'm like, you know, I had a beemer before that and I'm like, I'm not going to put a baby seat in the beamer.

Speaker 7:          03:31:30       I'm loaded tank. Say about the biggest Tundra with the biggest cab. The biggest one I could find. Put that baby seat right in the middle. So He's been, thing happens. God forbid he's gonna make it. You know what else they do if you're, if you're into this, they make side sliders on those cars there. They actually act as a side impact. Protection in what? What do you call rock slider. So they, uh, they'll raise the car up a few inches and put these rock sliders on the side of these cars. They do it a lot with land cruisers and they offer significant side impact protection. I need to met what cars have that. What cars were the, the, the, the, the, the best when it comes to accidents. Accidents. I would say like a dodge. Ram. Volvo is like known for that, right? Are they still number one, they're known for being like real safe and accident?

Speaker 7:          03:32:18       Yeah. Maybe somebody hitting you or are they still. Do they still make the strongest frames? Because basically that's what it comes down to. Who's making the strongest frame? Right. Not just that. It's also like how the body responds to impact, how it, how it crumples, how it, uh, how it's engineered delivers the best. I'm going to get that. That's my next car. I saw this car accident the other day. What does that Chevy volt one. No way number one. Top rated number one? Yup. What? As far as, as far as the accident crash test results? Yeah. Wow. That's crazy. What about, but what about them? I would say it would have to be like a ram or a Chevy Silverado. It's got to be though, because that's what they specialize in. That's their shit. Yeah, but they're not as big like if you get. Is that number one for suv?

Speaker 7:          03:33:05       What about for the number one truck? What's number one? Is that number one? What is it? What does it say? I'm going to get it. 10 safest Audi. Audi. Goddamn. Pop Up ads like Audi right there, right? What is that one? That's the Audi shoot. Something cute. Whatever the fuck it is. Q seven. That's pretty cool car. I've seen one of those before in real life as far as side impacts. Yeah. I think they. A lot of those cars have airbags and shit now and they just. Their pillars are designed to a certain amount of impact and they give in with stuff too. I saw a car accident the other day though at an intersection and it was a dodge ram truck in like some little peon Corolla. Ooh. They hadn't had on the Corolla was destroyed and then when I see people driving relative babies and tiny little cars and the car seats like right next door.

Speaker 7:          03:34:00       Yeah. It's rather scary. That's a scary one, man. One that'll fuck up. You know what? It's amazing. That's your baby. Think about how many cars are on the road. How rarely they slam into each other. Most of the time people keep it together. Most of the time. Most of the Times I kind of think the traffic kind of filters out bad drivers because bad drivers, they're not going to laugh. They're going to wreck, so we'll usually. We're left with people that have seen rex and they're like, you know, once you've been in a wreck, fuck, you're super careful. You know, my mom was in a terrible wreck, lost all her front teeth, terrible wreck, and she. Since then, this has been maybe 35 years. She doesn't drive on the freeway. She was like scared of death of the freeway. It was a horrible, freely accident and she won't ever drive on the freeway. I've seen some bad ones and bad ones coming home. Late night from the comedy store, cars flipped over, smashed, fucked up. You know, people are dead.

Speaker 7:          03:34:56       It happens. I even get a full call to fucking drunks anytime. We're going to have a mad. He was mad and it could happen to anybody, but he got hit by a train. He got hit by a train. He was trying to cross the train track. I don't know what the whole story was, but he got hit by a fucking train. How's he doing right now? Is Out of the coma apparently. That's good. Yeah. He's responsive. I mean if anybody's going to survive something like that, it's that fucking tank. You know guys at tank. I mean most. Most people probably would have been dead. It's pretty amazing. He was in a coma for quite a while. And what's worth. I mean getting attacked by a great white shark and get eaten or well, depends on what comes back from the car wreck. And he's like that dude from the dead zone.

Speaker 7:          03:35:38       They could see the future. Who holds your hands? So you're going to run for your money on John Jones. Hold your hands. You can see the future. Right? What does. He just starts predicting fights and he's. Yeah. How come this never that. Like there were they talking about like nuclear fallout. How come no one's getting super powers? Remember when you were a kid comic book, if there was a nuclear accident, you turned into the hulk when you turned to spiderman. It's a radioactive spider. Yeah, right. Yeah. Fuck. Today. Every. It's always bad. There's no like others radiation. Whereas yeah. Where's all the mutations? Where's the good mutations? There's no good mutations. No one ever has a good one. No one ever becomes like Magneto, right? Yeah. It's always like you're getting cancer. There's all this new release cancer fall out. Where is it at? You got to go to the places where it's at. You've received the video of a Shane Smith from vice, went to, um, went to Chernobyl and they, they carrying around these radar detectors are these radiation detectors. It's off the charts, man. They got wolves running around. They got cat fish. They're swimming in the rivers

Speaker 5:          03:36:36       that are all mutated and giant. Are they really mutated? I, I heard skeptical is. I'm hearing that there is no mutations and it's fake. Fake News. I Dunno. I Dunno. I mean, I don't know if you want to hear the conspiracy thing. I definitely don't. Okay. That's good. Good thing, man. That's a good thing. Radioactive catfish. Um, we've been doing like three and a half hours. Yeah. It's already 5:15 mg per it. Can they direct people to the replay? Definitely. Definitely. The female flyweights was last night on UFC fight pass. You can catch the replay anytime. You could watch all Ebi. Ebi, one through 12. They're all up there. We had our first all girl show, including an all girl combat Jujitsu tournament. We had a regular 16 girl tournament it totally with the people that were predicted to win it. They didn't even get close. It was, it was, it was A. I don't want to give it away. Don't say anything but a boiler. Yeah. And we had a four woman combat Jujitsu tournaments. Have you seen that? Have crazy Jujitsu with palm strikes to the face and head and body or legal. When you're on the ground standing, it's just wrestling, but on the ground, as soon as someone hits the ground, you could start palm striking to the face. Beautiful to the body. So, um, we had, uh, for woman tournament it was nuts. It was nuts.

Speaker 1:          03:38:07       Okay. And then September ninth we're going to be back. That's going to be the next fight. Companion. I'm not doing that. UFC, that's UFC 2:15 in Edmonton. So we'll be doing a fight companion pumped this week. Sacramento, Thursday night, Seattle, Friday night. And then San Diego Saturday night. There's tickets, tickets available for the second shows and all three of those places. Otherwise this whole program and we will see you soon.

Speaker 8:          03:38:36       Okay, bye. Bye.

Speaker 5:          03:38:47       Mm.
