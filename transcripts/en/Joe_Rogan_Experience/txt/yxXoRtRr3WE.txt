Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. Why wouldn't we assume that the reason why we're so conflicted and weird is because that's the proper mechanism that needs to be in place for people to move forward in the direction that we're moving forward. It'd be, it'd be constantly chasing technology without any real clear sort of a rational approach to using our resources and looking at the problems that we have because we're like a bunch of little kids that have like shit all over their house, but instead we're, we're outside working on the garden, you know, we're planting trees, we're not cleaning up the shit that we piled up in the middle of the living room and it keeps piling up every day to the point where we can't even live in our house anymore and we're concentrating on some shit that's not even ours.

Speaker 2:          00:38          Do you think you could ever, you probably couldn't, but maybe in your, maybe it stayed, like if you didn't have kids, in fact big family. So do you think you could ever live in like one of those airstream trailers by myself? Fuck yeah. Cause I was recently, I recently went to Joshua tree and one of those and I was thinking like, really this is all I really need and I could take my whole fucking house anywhere I want. And the new ones have like nice wood floors

Speaker 1:          00:59          and some of them expand out. You know, there's, there's been, um, you know, a lot of people that are moving towards minimalist houses, really small houses, but there's a bunch of online that show like how certain people live. And it's kind of interesting, you know, like one guy figured out a way to have like this little tiny cooking area and he pulls the bed out in the bed, comes out of the wall. He lives by himself and he has like some storage up in top, like toilet paper and things along those lines. But it's a tiny, tiny little house and a little kitchen dinette area. And you know, the idea is that like, really, why do we have to have this giant fucking footprint of House that we live in? You know, and
