Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Five, four, three, three, two live ladies. Gentlemen. A thousand episodes. Tom Scorah, Joey motherfucking Diaz. We're, we're delayed in starting. Ladies and gentlemen. We did not have a lighter. That was a real panic set in. That's embarrassing. Yeah. I thought I thought some shit was really going to go down, but thank God I am petrified of earthquakes and situations. I don't put slippers on. I sleep with sneakers on generator, a dog store. Water, water tools. I got two weapons. I got an a on. Have you been out here for an earthquake? Uh, one of them that didn't scare me but I was just sitting by the computer and I was looking at the cat bowls. Yeah. Yeah. You get high and I was looking at the cat. So it was another cat bowls and all of a sudden the whole building tip. Sure. The cat balls up in the air spinning and the cats running for their lives.

Speaker 1:          00:01:05       They acted. They were acting with a couple of seconds before that. And that's why I go. Why are they so fucked up? Oh, they were acting weird before the earth quarter your. So I started looking at the cat bowls dog stuff that they're doing that all of a sudden the dog, I just saw the cat bowls or it's like a cartoon went up in the air spending the earthquake and the whole building shifted. I heard the bricks, the whole thing. I told her about it being at night's sleep apnea, you gotta have a conveyor, whatever the fuck. And they sold for $600. You get one with everything. Lights an iron it fucking clean is your water. It's scary as shit when Shit, you panic about what earthquakes are likely if you, when you before you move here, you know, and then you like, I remember the first week I was here, I was in an apartment in Sherman oaks and I was standing at the kitchen counter of this person's apartment on their laptop doing like sending an email and I felt a little and I go in my head, I go, oh, that's the subway.

Speaker 1:          00:02:04       And I kept typing and then he could feel that. And I was like, yeah. And he's like crazy, right? That's the earth shake underneath your feet. And I was like, ugh. And it's like a panic sets in and you're like, oh my God, like I've, I've actually experienced the earth moving now. And then the next step is like when you are, you're like, if you're asleep and then you hear like you feel the dresser, the dresser, you know, or, or something that's hanging on your wall bumping, you know, what the fuck's going on, it takes you that extra beat to figure out you're going through an earthquake. That extra beat is fucked. It's funny. Have you been through? Nothing big but like fives, five point fives, a couple of those. The first one I was in was an aftershock of the northridge earthquake. I was uh, staying in north Hollywood and I was in this shitty apartment. It was made out of like fucking the same boxes that they used to ship refrigerators and like literally the walls when the earthquake hit the walls just went to with this. I mean, like the whole thing was just like a giant was pushing on the scariest. Fuck,

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       right. Yeah. Well it's humbling because you realize like, this is nothing. This isn't tune up the street, this is not going over any houses. Imagine what it felt like when that big one hit and it hit for 30 seconds for 30, 30 seconds is so long to feel the ground moving. That's one of those people moved to boulder. That's why that was just going to say that when you have that experience, there's some people that because app for a few days after the North Ridge, there was aftershocks and there's people that want. They look at their kids and go, I'm not going through this together and we'll. We're working on Wilshire big building. What if house. So a lot of people just a bad. That's what everybody's waiting for an earthquake here because then people leave and they sell their houses for dirt cheap. But it does happen.

Speaker 2:          00:03:51       What gun? They don't ever want to experience it again. But then I see a guy like my uncles lived here 55 and I've asked him, were you ever scared? And he goes, you know, you're feeling but do. When I first moved here, before I first moved here, I was out here for meetings and I went by a section of the highway, I think it was the 10 that had collapsed and they were moving cars around it and as we are. Is this what happened? Yeah. What is this an apartment building that collapsed the North Ridge earthquake in northridge. One. Yeah, dude, that was a fucking serious earthquake, man. Yeah, like fucking serious. And when I was driving by this one section of the highway, it collapsed on the lower section and I remember thinking that's just shit luck like this right here. Yeah. Yeah. Like you could be there and that is just shitload is really the thing lands on you and that's how you go.

Speaker 2:          00:04:41       I'm sorry. I am a hardworking individual. I really try to do anything I could to help myself. But when people call me, telling me they want me to go to a meeting in Santa Monica after like three, unless I'm picking up an envelope, I tell them no matter that kid won the Oscar for modern family and they said I was always the guy that went to ocean avenue, would five of those were additions. You deserve an Oscar because when you switched from the 10 zero five, you've got to wait on that ramp first world privilege right there, fucking high and you're in the middle of that ramp. Your mind starts playing. I'm telling you, I've been stuck on that ramp. I mean, I've gone never get a man. I just want to go through this ramp. I don't ever want to be in the middle of that ramp.

Speaker 2:          00:05:30       That's not good. Not Good. Your mind starts playing with you and you remember that goes into images and you go, fuck that. Okay, let me. Let's plan this right now. If the shit hits the fan, this thing shakes to the ground. Where are we going? [inaudible]? Listen, one of the main reasons why I like being in La is because I like you guys. Yeah, so we're going to all go like I like for real, like 100 percent like that. That was the thing that bothered me the most about Colorado. I, I, there was a lot of Nice people out there, but I didn't know you guys weren't out there. It's a weird feeling when we work together on, but there's something fun about running into you guys all the time. Like it makes life better. We do send it to the store, the factory in wherever we're at, we're.

Speaker 2:          00:06:11       It's more fun. It makes life more fun. This podcast, 100 percent I would do it. Group moved to Colorado. That's what I'm talking about. State. That's what we do. The group moved to. Colorado is the right way. You've got to remember guys. It's not a decision that it could be. You go home. Mrs Rogan sits you down and go, that's it. I'm not living this. Yeah, that's what. That's how. In fact, I packed the bags, get back Colorado without a whole cow. People. It affects that way. Oh yeah, but they go like this ends today with that, with that earthquake. Some you feel it. If you feel that motherfucker, the ones that take down highways, if you feel that you're like, oh my God, like, and this is not even a really big one. Really big ones changed the shape of continence. True. I mean that's the real fear.

Speaker 2:          00:07:00       The real fear is, is a giant one, like a 10 or an 11 part of you by the way always feels kind of crazy. Like when I was growing up in Florida with hurricanes that like after a hurricane you're like, are we staying after? This happens all the time. That's Florida Florida's mentality. Like we just brought up a good beer, but there's a hurricane that for whatever reason I feel like if you just in the basement, the top blows off the thing and you just fucking strapped. Or sometime like a wild ride at Disneyland, but now they give you these warnings. They're like, you're definitely going to die. You're at the beach and people still are like, fuck it. Yeah. Oh, for sure. My friend's mom, his mom is like 70 something years old and this big one was coming. They're like, this time we're not fucking around, this is a category five, this is going to absolutely devastate this area.

Speaker 2:          00:07:46       And she was like, absolutely not. I've been here 40 something years, nothing ever fucking happens. And he begged her and she was like, no. And it's like, you know, those are all those reports are always rolling the dice because they, they'll, they'll say it's going to be this bad and then it'll, you know, it'll turn or to land different. Yeah. And it turned into like a tropical storm. She was safe. She was like the only person that stayed like everybody else. We would always bail. I don't know if you were ever there for hurricane. No, but like we would always book it man. As soon as they were like, this thing is going to land, we're like, no, there's no way. And even driving in those tropical storms was an real men. Like you can't see an inch in front of the car. It's like you're driving through a car wash.

Speaker 2:          00:08:29       We had to stop once. Will you with me? When Eddie did that seminar in Miami when we were working at West Palm. Did you go down with us? No, we went. We Eddie's doing a seminar in West Palm or in in Miami. We're in West Palm. It's like a half hour away, so we left to go to the seminar and we were stopped dead on the highway. You could not see an inch in front of the windshield. It's amazing. It lasted for about 15 minutes, but it was too damn sky opened up the time there all the time. We don't even know what rain is. No, we don't even know and I never knew growing up, like in Boston growing up, growing up in Boston, I never saw that we saw it rain. We never saw that. That's some next level. I haven't really seen it duplicated since leaving there.

Speaker 2:          00:09:14       It's pretty crazy child. I saw one bad rainstorm in Jersey with a cloud's got dark. Yeah. It started hailing. Well. Have you been looped through Halan, Colorado as well as the videos of what? People's cars are just coming around it and there's one guy, one guy had a film of a lake, they were watching it and it slowly ramps up. It's like one, two, one, two, and he's like, well, look at the size of this hail, and then all of a sudden it's fun. It's literally like being attacked with rocks from space. Like, look at this pool. Yeah, there's a gang of these men, but like, look at this one that that's rock rocks. It fucks people's cars. Destroys, destroys call, and that was just happening to Colorado water dude. Thousand roofers moved to Colorado because there's work for two fucking years. Can you look at it?

Speaker 2:          00:10:10       It's getting worse. This is insane, dude. You get K okay. Especially if you're like a little kid. Oh, definitely. Being a five year old out in this fucking pummeled to death. Does anybody ever died from Hale? Has to have happened. Seems like it stops the girl. The first week I moved to Atlanta Monday and that Friday was the north Hollywood shootout. Oh, I'm not sure that we've got that Monday. I came in. I was living with Stan. Yeah. Went to find the job that Friday and there was a bunch of traffic and they were like, Nah, there's north Hollywood shooting north Hollywood shootout changed policing nationwide. You know that that incident changed the way they viewed having weapons changed their training. They never even competent contemplated that people would rob a bank with like fully automatic. You're coming up with the body, but just fucking blind.

Speaker 2:          00:11:09       It was laying by a car after he was hit just shooting up at helicopters and shit. That was fucking crazy, man. I remember that national news that was just like a big. You couldn't get on the one on one. I was in the news radio break room. We were, we were getting ready to film a scene and we're watching me and candy Alexander huddled up together going, what the fuck? Everybody came in, guys get in here, get in here. But they're all in. They're watching. They're like, what in the fuck? And it changed the way they, uh, what kind of tactics they use and the equipment they give police absolutely did 38 SPEC. Then they still reference it all the time. I did a ride along two months ago with the Hollywood division dude and I was a guy was still talking about. He's like, we have this because

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       of this shootout. The end, you know, that's a lot of people say, Oh man, fuck in the militarization of the police, man. This is what. There's a lot of it that's not good. You give to people too much power. It's not good, but if some shit happens like that, they need that. Otherwise they're sitting ducks. Yeah, kind of weapons. You get on the streets right now. Oh Dude, you only fuck crazy shit. Fire firepower. You get on the streets from Ar 15 and you get some wild shit on the fucking street. Yeah. Oh, you have to do. Is this number two real quick mathematics for anybody's interested. There's $350 million people somewhere around in this country. There's more guns in there are people and they're still making guns everyday. They make guns. There's a gun making industry. It's gigantic. They're making all kinds of guns all over the country.

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       Right? Every year, like every other, maybe more higher tech. Not Getting rid of any guns? No. No. Like all those guns for toys. Oh, give back to your gun and you'll get a toy. Okay. And then yourself? Someone who's a factory going on right now. They're cranking out ar as compassion and one person like, here you go. Some rusty old, 22 fucking handball court. But you get anything like jumping. Right? I can't believe they're playing handball. Still dedicated to handball who's like, I'm going to be the best. When you get out of prison doing prison, they play handball. So when you get out your claim disability, you play handball and it's to cover for you that you were half a momo, but you play handball. So guns that kill, you'll get a gun at a handball court for $50. That's shot three people that God has missed a motherfucking a motherfucking charlotte was so a motherfucker committed suicide.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       Long range with those guns. They don't give a fuck. They got guns that don't miss that. Handball courts. Did you play? You play handball in prison that you said? I played handball like the first two weeks. That just wasn't for me. You played in Colorado and because there was a few guys from the Bronx, so when I went to summit county, because I was arrested in boulder, but once you start your state sentence, they were going to send me to the Missouri or Texas. I ended up going to summit county. Summit County is like, we don't really have bars. Yeah, don't know. You could just do what you want here. Yeah. At night at 10:00, the God would go to the pathmark pathmark like a supermarket and get his chips and soda. It was like a fucking daycare. Wow. Everyone got along pretty well. You're a young guy with a dude from the bronx that played handball and we became friends together.

Speaker 1:          00:14:15       He had been on the run for 12 years, but this guy was brilliant. He was fucking brilliant. Like the shit he had done. He had driven the cop's car, like, what's that movie Leonardo Dicaprio cash pay for your care. That he was that guy and the final thing he did for them was if they caught him and he set them up on the drugs thing, like I read the paperwork. It was brilliant. He set him up on a drug drugs thing. He said, I know where I could go buy 10 kilos of coke. The cops actually gave him $250,000 cash to buy the 10 kilos of coke. He set it up with his friend, didn't have a car behind the house. The car was empty, the house was empty. There was no cops. Never even did a background check to see who lived in the house.

Speaker 1:          00:14:55       Jesus the house was empty. He went through the front and went out the back and disappeared. Travel for 10 years and he came back to the states because his dad died and they arrested him. He took a million years ago. He went for like a rubric and just played shuffleboard. Handball. That's a dark world. The world of the ex. Pat? No, South American tourists communities. Yeah. That's like that. Or a sizable too, right? I mean all over. All over Mexico. There's a lot of people in Brazil and I had a friend that South American dad was a island hopping all throughout his adolescence just to avoid taxes, just to avoid taxes. And then the crazy thing to me is that is that they came here like they came back eventually and so is he in trouble? And he's like, no, how is he not in trouble? He was like, I don't know, why aren't they going to catch him?

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       And he's like, no, what do you mean man? Like he's here now. Like is that a whole new identity? No, just don't worry about does he paid taxes? He said No. And he's like, well he doesn't, she still does. And then my friend was still like, you know, you don't have to pay taxes. And I was one of those guys. He goes, ah. He goes, Google it. It's like you have to pay taxes when that's your thing. Like just look it up man. God Damn it. Pay Your taxes to lock you up so quick. It doesn't matter if you pay them. See if you owe money to say like Exxon, you know, whatever, they'll sue you. You have to pay the money. You paid the money. But if the irs, if you owe money to the irs, they put you in a fucking cage for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:16:31       Godless of if you pay, let's say, even if you don't, even if you agree to pay it, say, yeah, you're going to go in a cage first. Yeah, no, pay your company money. They file a judgment against you and then they sell the paper and then you get called a comedy clubs. Like I used to, you know, when I first started comedy, I owed so much money. Did you really go to a comedy club? The manager goes, you just got a call to recall, and I go, Holy Shit. If Hbo really like collection, collect my mind, that would go with HBO. Oh Shit. I don't ever go joey. It's the same guy and I'd pick up the phone. Joey a discover card. We never got that payment. Motherfucker. Why fucking figure it out. They have tremendous scabs. Are People looking for you? They have a computer that they'll go on to see what other numbers that usually call you and they'll get that number when they call you, that number will come up over your caller id. They do some illegal shit when they're looking for you, but when you get a judgment from exon seven years, you don't pay it. It goes away. The government, that judgment never goes away. That the student loan these motherfuckers to tell student loans to suck that Dick. Oh yeah. Student loans come even more intense by arrest. Yeah. Well, you know, that's all the government as well. That's the thing about student loans is it doesn't get erased when you go to bankruptcy.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       If you filed for bankruptcy, anything else is gone. You know, I pay the student loan. I thought it was cute. I took the last one out. The Twenty six, 25 the minimum. Fuck you. I've done a couple of people. They showed up about three years ago. Dog with a big old number. I had to get an attorney to negotiate it down and get off at the irs. I didn't pay taxes from 90 to 2001 was talking. I was crazy. I was hiding. I was doing. What was that? Making 8,000 years of road common. Yeah. What am I going to file? So I didn't file. I made money one of the 13 years or 11 years and one day I walked in downtown downtown that we're going to shoot me in that. I took a number. They called my name. I went back there. I told them I hadn't filed them 11 years.

Speaker 2:          00:18:38       They asked me what I did. I talked to a lady for a half hour. She had. She goes, we don't go back for seven, so you got seven for years. Now they don't throw you and listen. You have to be a dumb motherfucker for them to throw you in jail or you have to be a public figure. They give you every option. Jonah, the public figure, you're actually worse off than if you're just legitimate businessman. If you a public thing. I could go down there with my attorney and said, look, I'm going to shoot 10 movies and the next time they wouldn't. They would not let Wesley snipes do that because we gave him such a hard. At first he was telling them all this shit that FEC rules and fuck the United States, Africa, and he was talking about all that shit and that shit drives them crazy. I don't think he. He was. He made a case that he didn't owe them.

Speaker 2:          00:19:28       You got to go in there humble and they'll play with you once you start talking about amendment 11, Thomas Jefferson, reparations, Chinese reserves. Don't give a fuck those people out there that convinced people that they don't have to pay taxes and people want to believe it, like a conspiracy theory. You know? It might be, here's the thing, you might have a legal argument, but it doesn't matter. They'll put you in a fuck. Can't get away. Carriage tax, evasion that money and put you in a fucking cage and you won't make any money from fucking the solution. What's that? That kid that we miss? Illusion is that situation. Whatever his fucking name is. Let me get a tissue paper from. Yeah, he's a nice guy. He's a really nice guy. Very nice guy. Wait, what happened to him? He tried to. He actually didn't just not pay his taxes. There were some shenanigans, contended he made less than he actually did get you on why these pete rose's and they got sinbad, remember that they were putting them on the front page of the La Times for years wise or dog Mike. The situation. More charges. Yeah. Coding, tax evasion and structuring tax evasion. Like once you structure it and you're the mastermind a, you're definitely going the farm. The

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       craziest part of the story was to me that for that period that they're like hitting them up about he made $9. Million million dollars. So friendly. No, I just was amazed that I didn't realize that from. I mean I remember that show obviously a huge hit, but that's incredible sum of money. We should really pay attention to this. Like not just his but what, what they can do. Because you think about what it is is we're just talking about money. Right. And we're talking about some deception on his part where he tried to keep some money. Yeah. Try to make them look like anybody else. Yeah. I say, or you're in some sort of a deal with costco and he'd do some sneaky shit and just that they, they can sue you, neil owe them and you have to pay them, but there's no threat of jail time.

Speaker 3:          00:21:28       Right, right. I mean, is there, have you tried to like cook the books? Would they get just what they put you in jail or were they just trying to find why fraud a today finds I'm guessing be the same kind of scrutiny and attention now that he's getting? No, I think it'd be all about paying a lot of money. Let's, let's put, let's pretend that Mike Sorrentino, was that his name? Let's pretend that he had some sort of a deal Chevrolet and uh, you know, he was using his name to sell cars, but he was fucking around with some money and cooking the books and little bit of this, a little bit of that to the same tune as what was going on with the irs. What do you think they would do to him? Would you even be seeing this on TV now? They would, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:22:06       It'd be like a suit, right? Because what they're saying is this guy tried to fuck that big daddy, right? I mean that's what they're showing you, showing you that big daddy gets mad when you try to fuck him. And in the grand scheme of things like in a lot of money for an individual to earn, but it's, you know, it's not money that affects big daddy. Daddy's coming after you. But here's the strange thing, big daddy is just people like, well, why don't we let anything be big daddy? Like the, I, we used to think of it I think from like almost like a primitive perspective. Like you have a king, you know, or you have a leader of a tribe. I think that's, that's how people used to think of it and used to think of all these organizations, whether it's the FBI or the dea as being a part of that, but there are just a bunch of fucking people and no, no person should ever be big daddy to the point where if you have money that's owed to someone else, perhaps there's some sort of an argument that you've been deceptive that they can just swoop down and take all your money.

Speaker 3:          00:23:03       Like they lock it all up like they're go, no, no, no, no. We're fucking freezing your funds. Like Exxon doesn't get to do that. Chevy doesn't get to do that over other corporations don't get to do that, but big daddy has the overall say if you violate big daddy's code, even though big daddy like you don't need you to get a receipt from, from big Daddy, big daddy, half your money and big daddy just takes it and spends as fuck. You want to whatever the fuck they want. And you know, you said you don't pay taxes. You fucking hippie. What are you a Bernie Sanders supporter? Not even saying that, not even saying that, I think, don't you think big data should be accountable if big daddy's gonna be able to just throw us in a cage because we don't give him ones and zeroes don't think big daddy should be a little bit accountable. Should be way accountable for their spending

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       way more accountable. Hey, you shouldn't just, you should be able to check off boxes to. There should be like still like needs like healthcare check, like a police department, check fire department check things that you. We all like have to pay and then there should be elective things. A bunch of elective shit. You know, I feel like they should also like our representatives should be way more willing and like actually like mandated to explain in detail and like what they're doing, what they're spending on it. I feel like a lot of, you know, house represent Congress Senate. There's just like an air of arrogance about the way that they even handle them. You know what I mean? They have power. Of course they are big daddy, big daddy and like it's. Yeah, I mean it's just like aloofness that they have is like, it's always been upsetting to him.

Speaker 4:          00:24:36       It's fucking gross. No one should be big daddy and you mean the, the people in Congress should be humble and you know, that's one of the things about Obama. Say what you want about Obama, whether you liked his policies as a human being. That guy conducted himself better than any president ever. The way he spoke, the way he interacted with people, the way he even responded to criticism, you know, we're not just talking, I'm not talking about his policies and you might hate to clap for them, be as good as it's ever been, which is why this trump thing is in such direct contrast. When he's yelling the other day, it's some reporter and he said, uh, you know, you're fake news. He used that again. Oh Man. He said, be quiet. Fake news or something like that. We're talking about something, you know, we can conflate the two, like if you want to take, talk about policy and effectiveness of it administration and just personal conduct.

Speaker 4:          00:25:27       Like let's say you take all the politics out of it. That's what bothers a lot of people to this moment still if you just even separate politics, which a lot of people are in favor of just the way he conducts himself. Some people love it. Listen, let's be honest. So it's very, very small amount of people love it, but a lot of people are on president. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You were saying before there's no debtor's prison. Yeah, there's no debtor's prison. When I first got into comedy, I was getting divorced. I was getting squeezed by an attorney and as much as i. I never forget the first day, I haven't missed sending a payment or anything. Like I'll never forget how sugar that my credit rating and everything. I worked all those years going down the toilet and then at that point is if I'm walking on nights, I might as well dance.

Speaker 4:          00:26:13       I mean I was just buying cars and fucking around and know what. They couldn't throw me in jail for all that shit, but one discovery closed my account. Yeah. And I went home and opened up my drone. One of those, because when you, when you want coke, you get fucking Einstein, creative Jack. I went home and I opened the drawer and I saw all those checks. Those three checks with discover sends you. When you first went to card, get the card. I had a bank account to Bank of Boulder or whatever it was called. I had my back, my car finance through that. I

Speaker 1:          00:26:43       wouldn't have had a 24 hour drive through. I wouldn't at 1:00 and signed that check over to myself for a thousand. I waited for two seconds and all of a sudden envelope came out with a 100 with 10 hundreds. I peeled them, did 90 out of the discover call, said you got an hour to bring that fucking money back or we're going to charge you with fraud. And I was put up against the thing. I went to the bank. I told them it was a mistake I didn't know and one lady said, you know what? I'll take that thousand dollars. I will give you the thousand, but I'm going to put it into your car loan and raise the payments by 25 bucks for every thousand dollars, 25 bucks, and that's the only reason why I didn't go to jail for that fucking thing. So they don't put you in jail for being in debt.

Speaker 1:          00:27:32       They put you in jail for deception. You know how they get athletes and entertainers. You know what that biggest downfall is when they go to comic cons and those autograph signings. Oh they don't. They don't get paid for. Those are they get paid for those don't report. There's two things. There's the people who get $5,000 flat and you take pictures all day. Then there's the people that get $10 for their tee shirt and $15 for a headshot and a smile. Yep. Those 15 that I was going in your pocket, Bro. You know what I'm saying? And what happens is you have to give a percentage to that $15 to the guy. It's like when you sell a merchant at a comedy club, now all of a sudden now they want 80 percent of your merchant. Same thing. Well that guy reports it, but pete rose. I'm just saying Pete Rose, I have nothing against Rosie.

Speaker 1:          00:28:18       My dog, Pete rose. We just put $15 in his pocket, right? What? $60 or he took 10 pictures. It's $150. That's how they get you on all those autograph things. What's going on here? What's this is from an article. That's what he's talking about. This article is talking about walking away from comic con with garbage bags full of twenties. This guy said he can make up to 250 grand shit twice. They didn't feel a need for representation because he's walking out with a bag full of cash. What? Who is he? It's like an unnamed person. He's a source. Deeply involved. The Steven Arnelle who became so enhanced the festival business that he started his talent. Talented. You see the Arrow to show the arrow. Oh, okay. Comic book show on Netflix. Wow. That's a lot of money. Fuck, that seems very strange. Comic Con, you pay for a booth and then I think you've given me three percent of the overall take. Don't you think? That's really bizarre. Having people pay to come and meet you. That seems weird. Strange. I think it's weird to charge somebody for a picture and, and charge somebody to sign. I mean, I guess the signing thing, I understand there's a bit, especially in sports, you know, business selling a book, but um, or visa or thing that you're signing $500,000 a weekend. Who the fuck gets that from the walking dead? Norman Reedus $200,000

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       guarantee to back guarantee p 500 grand a weekend follow celebrities will get a flat and the ones that are the way real low, like if you want Lucille Ball, like if you want happy days or something like that, they get piecework. I just changed my mind. I'm all in doing the next weekend. I'm taking pictures with your mom, your kid, you would never do this. Joe Rogan, like the other day, a friend of mine called me and he goes, I was at my dad's hospital room the other day and it was the funniest thing. Joe Rogan, a young Joe Rogan sitting around a campfire with people. He goes, I never saw that episode, and all of a sudden he pulls out a bag of dicks and he made every believer. He dixie goes, me and my dad would fucking Howard, you know, for some people in 10 years they're going to come to you and say, can I get to take a picture for $10?

Speaker 2:          00:30:34       I love the fact that we. And you're sit back on one picture now. I understand. I think it's a bad relationship. It is, but some people when they go to Comicon, yeah, they take their whole savings out there ready to go. Now I'm sure I understood the shame. I understand the chain, but I can make a living. What are you gonna do? I don't have any problem with it. I don't have any problem. People do want to make a living know who I was. Just saying. That's how you get nailed. That's how they nail you. Don't get that. Could you see yourself doing that? Talking to them back. That's what I'm saying. Listen, when I was a coke fiend, like sell cds after a show. So what, what does that tell you? Why I couldn't yet. I have to embarrass. Wow. I have a hard time.

Speaker 2:          00:31:15       I'd rather shake your hand and hug you. I can get the fuck out then you not come up to me because I'm selling a $25 seat there. Yeah, that's a funny thing about you joey. You know? Uh, I've, I've been friends with a lot of guys that had substance abuses. Like I told you about my friend Johnny back in New York. And one thing that you both had in common is that even though you have like these issues, there was never a point where I felt like I couldn't trust you with something. You know, like I, you, you never would sell anybody out. You would never, you know what I'm saying? Like, you know, you're not a type of person who would do something to hurt somebody else so that you could profit because you were sick and you needed drugs. That was never you. You always had like a strong code of ethics.

Speaker 2:          00:32:01       Get out that you were worth nothing. I was a jam that had problems, but when are we started telling people he's a junkie but he pays his bills. Will you? Will you know like, what the fuck are you talking about? You're just a guy struggling in and I recognized he knew a lot of what I had seen in my friend Johnny was that there's a lot of people that are brilliant people that for some reason the fabric of society just doesn't fit. That just is. There's something about getting up in the morning and go into a job and you know, whatever it is about the way they were raised to experiences they had, just who they are inherently from whatever the

Speaker 3:          00:32:39       factors are there. Certain people that just can't do the regular thing and they just need to find this other thing for you is obviously stand up and once you found that other, the thing and became successful, that other thing, that's when your whole thing changed. That's when you were. I mean, it was really proved positive. I mean for sure. You learned a lot of things about life. You got older, you get wiser, you know, but I think a big part of you becoming more comfortable and more relaxed and becoming who you are today is that you, you started becoming successful as a comedian. And when you started becoming successful as a comedian, like, like, well, 10 years ago things started really ramping up for Ya. Uh, noticeable, relaxing, a few noticeable change because you, you, you realize like, oh, this is what I'm supposed to be doing.

Speaker 3:          00:33:27       The problem is when this isn't working. And then you think, well, maybe I should go back to selling cars. Or maybe I should get a job in a factory. Maybe I should. Maybe I should do something a three or four nights a week. Just bartend. Make a little extra money, lighten up the load on the family that when those types of things start fucking with you and that's when you start doing coke. That's when you start going crazy. That's when you stay up late. That's when you fuck off. That's when you make big mistakes. Like you're unhappy, you're upset, you're in the wrong groove. It wasn't the external struggles as much as the internal struggle or maybe all of it together. No violent this November, so it'd be 10 years. I haven't done a lot of coke and coffee. It's amazing

Speaker 1:          00:34:09       with you. The January after the November and you're like, you haven't done it in 60 days and that was still. I wasn't sweating it out. Yeah, but I still wasn't trusting myself. Right. I thought I could snap at any minute, some chicklet hot pits with a gram of coke or whatever, but you gotta remember Bro. For me it wasn't about success or or selling tickets or for me it was just doing something with my life where I've come from. All I wanted was just to do something with my life. If I could pay rent, feed the cats, smoke pot and do spots, that's a lot better than what I used to do. Yeah. That's how a lot better than when the life I had you understand that even if I don't go on the road and I'm not Louis, c, k, it didn't matter to me. Just that I didn't have to carry a gun or worry about people knocking on my door. I was like Richard Gere and Austin's gentlemen. I had nowhere else to go to the store and do that stupid spot at 12, 45 and look what happened. You just keep showing up. Yeah man,

Speaker 3:          00:35:16       there was a big part of it, but another big part of it was getting you on the Internet. That was the thing. So we get a chance to show people what I already knew. You know, with like the only way for you back then to get exposure was you had to do something conventional. The only thing that existed, they had to put you in a movie or put you in a TV show and you got an a few movies, movies and you got an a few TV shows, but they didn't get to see you as Joey d and c, but they got to cut some fucking character actor and you know that mob movie with Robert De Niro. But there's a big difference between that and you like this. You just took the. Took the right thing for you to be this. You took like the Internet, but the Internet has like for Joey is the best medium ever.

Speaker 3:          00:35:59       Yeah, for sure. It was exploded. Well for you to know it's gone. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Like it. I like it. You're just as good of an example. Like you don't have a lot of success outside of the Internet. No, that's true. The Internet has been your shit man. I mean think about it. You didn't have like a long running television series or a series of movies or anything you do, but you're selling out places that a lot of those guys can't even fuck with all the time because of your podcast, which is if you haven't seen it, it's your podcast with your wife. It's one of my favorite podcasts. It's so fucking consistently silly. That is so ridiculous and people get silly when they get on it. They do and then you know, I start seeing things like, oh, this is like your mom's house bit. I need to send it to Tom. Yeah, you sent me a couple of good ones.

Speaker 5:          00:36:47       I can tell a story about taking this shit without 90 people hitting me up the next day telling me that was the most brilliant story in the world. We're going to send it to Tom. Tom. I tell her shit. Shit comic. It's awesome. Bought myself something. Discussed two days later. Sure enough, I'm the fucking youtube videos. Played Joey telling shit stories for sure and he told us about when he shit in his backyard and somebody thought it was got the lady she leave. She will let her dogs out everyday and she would clean up. They will French poodles dogs. It was just as high up in the air, just reeling back from this shit, this shit. Joe Rogan. She looked at it and she was like 58. So she's squinting at this shit up against the wall. I took a shit and I put my back against the wall.

Speaker 5:          00:37:47       So when I shift, when you shit outside, it's not going to be a decent shit. It's going to be like explosive. So when I got up it looks like somebody got shot in the head that we should all behind me. So she's sitting there with a little French poodles, Chihuahuas and she's looking at the wall like, what the fuck happened? Then all of a sudden she actually walks up to close to it and squint and look at it and looks around and runs it. I'm watching all this. I can't breathe. And now I go to the computer because my wife's very decent sitting there for half and then my wife comes in and she goes, were you home all day today? I go, yeah, why? She goes, I just had a conversation with Susan.

Speaker 5:          00:38:30       She wanted to know if you heard anything in the back yard. Then I went to get Sushi, but give it a go get Sushi. I eat a lot of it. Hey, the rice pushes everything out. Yeah. You had plans to go get a weed store. You will go to the post office. But I made a detour. I plan to go home, but I left the house key in the house so I had to climb around the window. That's what happened. Yeah. Yeah. So when I pulled myself up, I actually landed with my stomach on the window and now you've made it push it out more like fuck. And my hands are struggling in the window and my feet are on the other side and the cat's scratching at me. Right. And I might get to me.

Speaker 5:          00:39:15       So I ran out, ran down the stairs, shit outside. Oh my God. Nobody took a shit in favor in his backyard after a five hour drive from Colton or some weird town and not talk to you. After that for awhile I took a shit and then he ran over. It was called backyard. Smelled like sewage. He goes, it smells back here. Let's walk in the house. I don't know what happened and you can see the brown shit. He smashed it with this tire and a bunch of flyers or talked to me for a month after that shit in somebody's backyard because I told him the truth. I felt bad.

Speaker 5:          00:40:03       That's hard to clean up. Yeah. Shit, dog shit. It doesn't even make you gag like human shit. Bomb Shit to clean up some wine. Oh Shit. If you had to use one of those scrapers. Yeah. It smells so much stronger, man. It's so much. No, no, no. When you kick a shit until you cut it in half when that. When that reese's peanut butter fume leaks out. Oh my God. He's like, I've done studies. When you go to jail, when you, when you go to prison you have to cut the shit, the shit like in the tube, but people watching TV, like when you go to county jail you shit right there. So black guys will be laying there watching TV with their feet up and also this little shit and they're like put some water in that whole motherfucking like they'll just yell at the other side of the fucking prison because that means you, you took a shit and just sitting there.

Speaker 5:          00:40:58       So imprisoned as soon as you shit you got to put water on it. Yeah. But then some bathrooms that only give you 20 ounces of water a day. So whatever time you flush, it's got to be a good flush. You follow me. So sometimes the pis has to stay there until the next day until you take a good good shit. But when you take a shit in jail bro, that's what they'll tell you because of water with some hole in that motherfucking old dog. I could smell that shit. Right now I'm trying to watch oprah, but that's what smells. One stuff sucks. It's like when you go to Vegas to have that sucking action. If took the ship is

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       big. That's 34 inches once it breaks and it looks like two new jobs. Once that breaks, it's over. It's over. And they put the bathroom right by the door. The front entrance? Yeah. That have nobody come over. That's why I always go downstairs, take shit. I don't Shit in my bathroom, in the hotel no more because it kills the whole room for two hours. We worked at the House of Blues in Vegas and uh, Joey left a, an onshore shit. You know what onshore shit is like, he, he was so fat at the time that he couldn't sit down and like the regular toilet. You were like, what were you four slash 15? He was giant. Giant. So when he would take a shit, he would had have to balance himself mostly on the very edge of the front because his ass was so big. Wide Shit in the water on the deck.

Speaker 2:          00:42:22       No. Oh, so you ain't never seen shit like that before. So you couldn't sit in the toilet. I would sit on the toilet, but I don't like the ad. It wasn't that I was fat. I don't like my dick inside the toilet. Right. Suck his dick and off the toilet. I tell my wife, don't even let my wife be in public because I want to eat her monkey. I don't want that monkey touching the other thing. So when I shit in a public bathroom, I hope my balls and I shit towards the edge. I don't give a fuck in somebody else's backyard. So your soul, your balls and sit where you are because none of them to move forward because if I'm back there, I got grabbed one time sitting on the toilet. They'll jump from that toilet inward like they jumping over a month. People who are saying they got crabs to the toilet isn't an excuse.

Speaker 2:          00:43:10       Well, sometimes you can create crabs from anywhere, but why they it take it from here? They only cleaned the hairs. I don't think they're like little stay on an actual toilet. I think probably. Definitely. Right? Yeah. I would feel like that's one of the things about crabs. I took a shot at the gas station that had to be at. That's what I haven't figured it was. I'm sorry. I always hold my shit. My Shit. It was long and red band. Put Ketchup on it. Remember red band? We'll catch up. Unfortunately. I think that was a different time. Okay. This is not happening. It has been many, many times. Things just like sticking out of go in there. There's a smell. You know how when you take an epic shit, it's an above water shit. It comes out like, like the fucking big island of Hawaii just rises through the water.

Speaker 2:          00:43:55       Like I've done that many times because I eat too much now and I'll take these shifts that are just so big. They're preposterous, but there's a totally different smell to those shits because you're smelling raw shit outside of the water. I mean it's, it's, it's gone through the water and it's poking into the wrong. What is it about that that makes you happy? What is it about the sense of accomplishment? First of all, here's a good one, right? It doesn't come around that often either. Yeah, man. It's like a comment like and it just like, I don't. This doesn't happen all the time. It's always diarrhea too. It's never like. It's never like a super thick law. It's weird when the second wave is diarrhea. Like when you take a shit, you're proud of yourself and then you're like, I think I got a little more in there.

Speaker 2:          00:44:40       And it's like, God, it's just a fucking, you know, that's from what healthy eating, healthy eating does that. Yeah. If you eat some mct oil or coconut oil, lubes up your pipes because where I moved to them and have the office to back office and it's connected to a backroom. It's got a door so I don't live with distinct no more. I opened the door in the morning with backyard. I shit. I smoked a bowl backyard anymore. No, no, no. My dog goes faces to the backyard. I had my own bathroom and the bedroom. Then don't put a woman through one of your shit's back there. Yeah. Leave her alone. Opened the back door. Fuck the fuck. I just opened the back door. This is school behind their kids playing. I'm shitting and smoking dope. I don't give a freshman as fuck. I just don't smell.

Speaker 2:          00:45:27       And then I'm like, light a candle. That's beautiful. Beautiful. That's what you need is a bathroom with a door that faces out. The worst is when you go over a girl's house and you go to use your bathroom and you smell matches. Oh yeah. Oh No. She was lightened. This motherfucker up tall. You're thinking about burdening her off fumes. Yeah, the stinky. But thinking about her math. You ever get to a girl's place and then you feel the gurgles and you're like, read one. I could. I've had that before. I was dating a girl once. She had ferocious diarrhea. Ferocious. So she was in regular time. So she went to the bathroom and she just turned on the shower and she turns on both things on the sink. Whoa. Yeah. And just see what she tried to drown it out. I'm like, what the fuck is going on?

Speaker 2:          00:46:19       I was very young at the time. It didn't understand what was super confused. The fuck is going on in there. I had, I had once in college where I was at this girl's place and she was just like, Hey, it's game on, like go for it, right? Like I have to take and I could feel that it was a diarrhea, explosive diarrhea shit. And I also realized there was no way to do it that, that it would just be a black toilet and there's no way I could cover. So you know what I did? I went back to my place, I was like, I'll, I'll see you some other time or whatever. And the next day her friends like, you're like the fucking, like they gave me credit, let that guy that I was a good because they were like, you're awesome. And I was like, no, I had to take my girls because they're not getting fucked and they don't want their friend to get fucked.

Speaker 2:          00:47:02       Right. So they used reverse psychology on you. You're an amazing guy. I got an amazing guy. Credit help you wait forever. A cycle that you left out. Even when you get married, tell her, get married to have sex after you're married. Never. It's not about that. It's about real love. If I had had bows that were intact, it would have been a different story that night. But bowels. Bowels. Yeah. Yeah. There's a time when you know that it's in the sensitivity of your inner asshole region. Amazing. It is. It knows. Especially when you go to seep out a Fart, right? When you're about to cut a fart and then also the alarms start going off. You're like, oh no. Oh yeah. Oh No, you've got to clamp shot. You're like, Jesus, what is this? We were having this debate yesterday about why are they sometimes hot, like why is it hot and then why does. Why do you know that hot is going to smell bad? Spicy food bro is the. But is that what it is? Solely? I don't know. I was telling you guys at one time my freshman year, I didn't take your ship for a week and a half. I was addicted. This fake

Speaker 5:          00:48:08       to how long is that?

Speaker 2:          00:48:12       I was in when I was five. I played freshman ball and we were playing paterson eastside. Wait, just a jungle over school. Like you got to be careful when you're going there and we went there to play the Christmas tournament. Well, what kind of ball are we talking right now? Basketball and I hadn't taken a shift for like 10 days. I was something. I took acid, something fucked my thought until nobody in those days I was really scared of doctors and I wouldn't say shit to nobody. Way Home. We got on the bus and while we will wait, their stomach started hurting and I said, Jesus Christ, I don't know if I'm going to shit myself a Fart, but let me just take a chance. Good move. And I blew this far. Joe Rogan. That was so bad, right? We want a bus and people started running. You know the school buses. People started running into the wind goes right to swing down the bus windows, but here's what it gets better. I father again,

Speaker 5:          00:49:12       teachers would go, oh my God, he's changing flavors, but what's the worst thing was the cheerleaders are crying. That's how bad they were sitting in front of the bus going to. The teachers yelled, Oh my God, he's changing. That's how bad parts, next tee shirt. He's changing bus. I'll never forget looking at the cheerleaders were like, Oh my God, we've never smelled like this. Big fight was fucking God awful. I wrote a blog about one enjoys farts wants because I don't have plain. Yes. I think I read. That's called happy pills and it was. I was thinking about. I was, I was looking at this ad, take this. I was looking at this ad for antidepressants, some girl,

Speaker 2:          00:50:03       a field of wheat and shit. You know those, those ads and a good. I was just thinking about like, like what? You know, what depresses people and how crazy pills are and how great. Oh, it's still up there. You can still find it. Anyway, at the end of this is really like me. We're both, both of us are barbecued. I don't know what the fuck. What do we add? Some sort of edibles in the beginning. Lolly pops way in the beginning of

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       we were crucified. Oregon was asleep. Yeah, he was going in and out, but he wrote on the blog and I don't even have to look at the farm. Was strong. He's lucky I fought it because it was a lot better than the Antonio banderas movie he was watching something to do is on Antonio banderas moving in. I don't remember what it was, what it was, but I do remember the lady behind you. I will never forget hearing her over the ear phones. Yeah, I hear. Oh my God, there it is. Over the salad in my ipod. I hear a woman in the row behind us cry out. Oh my God. I look over at show and he smiles. There's your fucking happy pill right there. That's your right. Antonio banderas it says. Oh, what was it? Oh yeah. Teaching underprivileged youth. How to salsa. Oh, that's what I was watching.

Speaker 5:          00:51:21       I was watching a terrible move. Terrible. We both were and Joey farted. The fart of all. Do you remember? By the way, the seat. You haven't had those parts where you actually feel your leg was jazz. When you're in a plane and it's going to go down, what's the button you push? Your seat was seat belted into your waist. My God, it was terrible, but another time I fought. I used to, I used to take the number one bus from Jersey City to the high school and we were on the bus one morning kids and there was a guy reading a paper, I can live to be 100 and never forget this reading the daily news and he had a connector of drool from his lift, the Daily News, and it was a puddle. He was on heroin. They would go to Jersey City in those days and get Methadone so they would take the bus up north with us.

Speaker 5:          00:52:14       So I'm sitting there, he's passed the fuck out and the drool is connected to the daily news and this guy to be just six inches of public. This guy's been passed out for 20 minutes. I point my ass at him. I'm not sitting behind them. I'm sitting across from them and I lift up my hips a little bit. Kept my ass or just point that even if it wasn't pointed at him, he would ricochet off the chair and go straight and through his mouth. Like he's sitting there and I let a fart go out. Oh, I could live to be 80. He lifted his eyes like he went like this first, like, man, who the fuck? He goes, it smells like something. Went up some of these as and died and me and my little buddies were like, what? The center will fucking giggling. He like, I should beat the fuck out of my. Oh my God. Fantastic.

Speaker 1:          00:53:32       This is why I hate people. This is why I hate when I read. Give me a second. This is the reason why I ain't read posts from people going, are you singing tonight as blue comedy will come down to the standard feeder in Friday night and listened to intelligent comedy, fought provoking comedy, and then I think about it, how many times I'm 54 years old and at night I got a sleep apnea machine on and there's a little needle in the sleep apnea machine because the hall was punches and into your fucking mouth. So there's an escape valve that's the size of a needle. You know how many nights I will sit there and be half asleep and I'll need the fart and I'll wake up just to see if I could smell the fucking fart. Come through that whole you? Yes. If it comes through, it's a tremendous fault.

Speaker 1:          00:54:24       I just wake up my wife like I go on it. You got it. Have it. Like it's that good. I'm 54 years old. That always makes me laptops to Gore. People say to me like, I love thought provoking collie dog. If it makes you laugh. It's comedy. It's comedy. Stop with the fucking, you know, you almost hospitalized me one time from laughing so hard. Like, I don't know if you remember this. I'm serious. I don't even know if I could tell it. It was. It was backstage. It was backstage at his show. We were somewhere and you were like, how's the wife? You and I go, you go where she. And I said, I said some city in Tennessee, maybe Knoxville or Nashville, and you go Nashville 90 six and you started the story about working the club and you're like, I just riffed in between shows some crazy shit.

Speaker 1:          00:55:23       Come chick who's talking? There was eight people, there was 20 people for the first show, Knoxville. It was a comedy zone show. I have booked it. Knoxville's a great little fucking town, like a cute little Tennessee town does it? It's like hip, it's, you know, like a college town. So I get down Friday night, Joe Rogan, I'm headlining, I got 38 minutes, I just moved to La and I signed with creative management and they booked those wrongs. So booking me on as Atlanta. I was just dying. Slowed that. So what they did was they put me in one nighters that paid like two 75 and nine. They weren't bad. Tennessee, you know, and we go to Knoxville for two nights and I go in there and you know me, I'm fucking crazy. First night I go in there to Friday night, there's 20 people for the first show and there's a girl, Joe Rogan that's a 12 with a guy that's a four.

Speaker 1:          00:56:15       Okay. And it's her birthday, you know, meanwhile through it, she just turned 21. It's a birthday. Okay, happy what's going on here, you know, because once you start hearing noise you have to react to it as a comment and you go, what's going on? And he was 21. I said, you're very beautiful. And then she just went and ran with it and started talking about how her husband pimps are out. He would have fights on and for 20 bucks you could fuck her in the back room twice. Fights were on whatever. I don't know that on Fridays he would bring it to the construction truck, a truck with her to the construction site and put a mattress in the back and at lunchtime he will let her friends and she's telling me this. It's like she's 12 and people like just holding their breasts, like what is going on here?

Speaker 1:          00:57:03       This girl is beautiful and this retarded just pimping up. So in between shows, I go upstairs to do a line of smoke, a joint or whatever the fuck I'm doing. When I come back I see her by herself. When we start talking to them about what's going on, oh my God, I had such a great time. I go, what's that stuff? True? And she goes, yeah, I go show me the monkey. And she me in the woman's bathroom pulled down her pants. The girl had a monkey that was spotless. She didn't nearly stunk. I ate it. I find that some. And then she sucked my Dick. That was it. I went back to my room. I didn't think nothing of it. I'm like, Jesus Christ, I go back for the second show that AP. But by the time I got back for the second show, Joe Rogan, she's sitting in the back, she's doing, she's looking at me like this.

Speaker 1:          00:57:49       She's fucked up and 10 minutes into my spot set because I was headlining. She starts going, I sucked the Comedians Dick Tonight. And I was like, what are you talking about? And she's like, I suck this Dick. And he came in my mouth, he's like, what the fuck are you talking about? The cops had to hold him back and he's like, I want my $40. That's all he wanted. He didn't care his wife Suck my dick at this comedy bedroom. Oh my God. When the cops came, he kept saying, man, somebody is going to get hurt if I don't have my $40. That's a 40 hour blow job. Did you come in her mouth? Because if I wouldn't have come, it would have been late 20. Oh he cared about was the $40. So he told me that backstage at your show. And I fucking started hyperventilating. $40 for his wife. This is the world of comedy, Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the world of crazy fucking comedy. Jesus.

Speaker 1:          00:58:49       I think that's crazy why she's crying. Some of the hugging his wife and said, you know, no, he didn't care. He just wanted the $40 with a blow job. I didn't give it to them. It's got rules. You've got to give him that. He's got like a line in the sand. Mrs Got. He's got 40 fucking crazy animal when you sit at home at night and you think about all the shit we were seeing, we were learning a lot. I don't think I've ever laughed as hard. Well, that's probably second time right there on that road. We do a lot of things. You want a lot of things about human beings. You. One of the things about individual, you learn some grabbing my American home. It's uh, uh, armed forces place in Idaho. It's part of the triple rock. This was, I walked in and I had to go meet, do a sound check her, but he kept looking at me going, hi, how are you?

Speaker 1:          00:59:44       Have you met sandy yet? And I go, no. And they go and they can walk away. You ever see a movie with Eddie Murphy when he with Boomerang, when he goes to the black chicks out said to 80 and the Butler keeps laughing. Remember the Butler would go. She wants to see in the kitchen. He would go because she knew he was gonna. She was gonna rape him. So every time somebody will refer to Shirley, they go, have you met Shirley? And you go, no. And they go, oh, and they'd walk away with Shirley, wherever the capital that base was the head of the base. She was his wife. And if a band came to town or a comedian came to town, she blue. That's it. That was the rule. Like he and he would sit out there with his fucking military armed with all his shit and class and she'd be in the back color mink because the whole band, I mean this is crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:00:38       So I didn't know about this. She came over and started talking to me and then she started telling all your Cuban. I dated to Cuba one time. He was such a big thick. You have a big thing. I mean it was that white glove. It was quick. Like she just gets to it. She's like 15. I was maybe like 31. She was maybe 50 and she just dropped behind the curtain, took the hammer out. I'm sitting there minding my own business and all of a sudden somebody comes yelling for Shirley, Shirley, Shirley. Now usually, surely we get up and stop sucking your Dick. Not Surely. She moved her knees like I had neon belly. Belly. He's supposed to move this way. That's what she did with a nice. She kept sucking and just kept moving this way. She. I tried to take it out of her mouth.

Speaker 1:          01:01:21       She wouldn't let it. She's like, no, no, no. She, she wouldn't stop until I met Shirley out here and this is crazy shit. I can't. I'm overstimulated. I feel like I feel like I need psychiatric treatment right now. We just finished that fucking drink. My main greatest thing anyone's ever said that is the best word mean kid juice. But boy it's minky. Ah, but when they say they cut it short, what is the word? What does it mean? Get me, suck my Dick. Mika. In the Sukkah. Right. Okay. You know, it's so weird how the morning. This is Italian Sicilian. Really? So the deeper you go down to boot, the more. Is it closer to Spain or is it farther from spraying? The closer it Lee is from Spain. When people from that area speak

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       Italian, I don't care how fast they're talking, they can't put the wool over me because I can pick up every four words. Right. So Sicilian say Sukkah what's sucking Spanish? Trooper. Trooper. You're in the neighborhood, right? So when they say it's like, you know what, what are you gonna do today? I'm going to go and get my Minka suck. But sue, I mean because just the short second shirt of this show. So on me. Sure. And then you got minka juice comes at you where you want it. Cheers. Cheers. When you, when you hear those Latin languages like Spanish and you hear a Italian, like those languages seem to like feel like a let's have fun language. You know, everything has got a thing to it. It's kind of a rhythm. There's a way to talk. It is fun. Yeah. Fun to listen to. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:03:19       Especially not really knowing anything about what they're saying. I can pick up like one out of 100 words maybe. Right? Yeah. And so I hear them talking and I'm like, well, when bitcoin was in, but it's. So for me it's almost just like hearing the rhythm of them talking. Yeah. It's like a fun sort of a smooth relax, but I get you an express or talk to you and it's very hard when other gestures, hand gestures. Yeah. You can always tell when a Latin person like across a room. Yeah. Just by their hand gestures and they start, you know, glad to see me les to see me like this. Just hearing how long did it take you? How long do you think it takes you for you? Just to get the book. If you're in France for a week? Yeah. Like it takes you three days just to get the like I'm not going to learn French and three days, but let's take you three days to get the Jif.

Speaker 2:          01:04:16       I wonder like French, like if they come up to you and ask you what you want from the menu. Like after you go to nine restaurants, three days he had a little something. Yeah. You get. Especially if you have like a Latin root too though, you know, like you're comfortable with it. Does it ever bother you when you hear stories about Americans going to like Paris and like, uh, the Persians thinking the Americans were Dicks, the Americans like acting like assholes to people from Paris. Like what is that? Like? How did that whole room or get started? The loud American. Yeah. Had that whole like us versus Paris thing. You remember when they wouldn't call things French fries that were calling freedom fries. Bushier, right. Do you remember that? Yeah, like freedom fries. It's always like the French, you know, like there's always, there's always some weird like right wing punchline about the French. How much interaction do you. I think at point for me it's inherited

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       or. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I think it's every country. Remember that episode of the Sopranos? Women with daily chef. Can I get some red shorts? He's like, I want a red sauce. Marinara, and the guy looked at the other guy. He goes, if you think these Germans a class list, you know what I'm saying? Like, look at this guy here. He's like, they all have. Every country must have something towards. Yeah. I hear that. We're hated across the world, but then one person like you traveling, you go know pro people were very nice. They are nice. If you are nice and I think that's universal. People are Nice if you're nice. Yeah, pretty powerful that people appreciate it pretty much everywhere. People are Nice. If you're nice, you know, and and the way you are changes the way they are, you know, like if you run into someone and maybe they're a little bit defensive but you're openly friendly, a lot of times the relaxed that whereas if you run into someone in their sort of defensive and you're aggressive with them, then it ramps up and the whole thing becomes like some sort of a weird ego disaster st person, different person interacting with them saying the same words.

Speaker 3:          01:06:32       It's just the whole thing about people and the way we talk to each other. Yeah, because we're, it's a, there's no one person responsible for an argument, you know, most of the time it comes from both sides and how you interact with people. Even if you feel like you did nothing wrong. It's a lot of times, like a big part of how the conversation started shaping itself. People don't want to. Everybody wants everything to be black or white, right? It's either like if you got an argument with the dude, it's his fault or it's your fault, but it could easily be both. Can easily be like just a mismanaged situation. You know, you might have been coming there because there might've been some fucking problem that they were supposed to fix on your car and they didn't and you know, you are in your car headed to the comedy store and you're like this mother fucker and the light starts going on again.

Speaker 3:          01:07:23       Like God damn it and you get there. You're already a little bit ramped up and you run into someone and then you're already coming at them at like a six and if you get an interaction with them about like, hey man, anything I can get in front of you, I got to go some where you're like, fuck you man. Right? That could happen. Totally does. You don't know. You don't know. That's why I've always learned the very important lesson in life. You don't know what that guy's going through it today. No one does. Right before you hit her members, before you give that dirty guy, it's the hardest thing to cut them off. Yeah. You don't know if his wife just left. The kid just told him she was a lesbian. You know, this is all of a sudden he's got a girlfriend. He goes, have a fucking gun car. You don't know what somebody is going through. Right? You have no idea what time that mind coming up to you. You know? One of the most genius thing is I ever heard was

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       that a great Carlo Gambino. Never answered his own door. He always had his wife answered the door because no matter how mad a mobster came over, no matter how, like he just got off the phone with this fucking guy and he won't give me 10 kilos. Carlos' going to resume this no matter how mad I came into the house, his wife would stop you, make you sit down and give you an express on giving you a score and talk to you. So by the time you got into Carlo, you were slowed down. He was very smart that way. That's beautiful because he always, his wife was like, everybody's mom, one of those ladies that you'll go ahead and come in and get me. So that's why it's not good for everybody. If men get together for long periods of time, I think that I think that people should.

Speaker 1:          01:09:09       Anybody who's involved with customer service should take some type of something to let to calm people down. Like people who work at an airport, you know, there's got to be a system out of slow somebody down. It's a brilliant system. Having a wife that like a very nice person that sits you down and you realize like, listen, this is what's important in this kind of friendship here. Like half of the issues that people get into. It's a perspective issue. It's like, like especially if you're like a monster and he thinks so much fucking you over and you're like, oh, you know, where's my fucking money? And you sit down, like come on. Perspective issue. Yeah. It's most of what it is like how are you looking at your relationship? Are you trying to fuck this person over here trying to work together in harmony? If you're just trying to work together in harmony, I bet it'll work out.

Speaker 1:          01:09:59       We all travel. We ever have a bad travel day and we get to a hotel and we'll fucking furious with that little lady at the counter made us laugh and for sure about what just happened. True. And should we even do something that will change your whole outlook for the day? Like she'll go, oh by the way, I know you were delayed. We told the kitchen to save your spaghetti and meatballs and you're like, you bad motherfucker. You Wow. You know? So that's. I liked it when that happens. I love when I'm furious and like walk into a hotel and somebody slows me down and talks to me and it's really cool when people have that. That's a gift by the way, to actually slow somebody down and be able to touch him and go, hey man, it's going to be fun and coming up. Let me take it to the track them. If you have a business, you have a customer service representative, someone who meets people at the door and that person has an amazing personality. That shit is worth a lot of money. Oh yeah. I can't coach it. You can't train whether it's a guy or a girl and I've met him on both sides. You know, you meet people that work in a certain place where you look forward to going back to that place to saying hi to that guy because that guy is just super cool. You're like, what's up? What's up man?

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       And like you've made like legitimate friendship with this person and that's possible too. You know, this idea that we all have to be constantly at odds with each other and I think even like security people, like when I see when I'm in a restaurant or a bar or a sporting event and I see a security guy is what's that word is dissolve the situation without throwing a punch. Especially when a person a good one, especially when a person's drunk. Listen, I can talk to you when you're sober. Once you got four cocktails on the, I'm going to talk to you once. Some of my patients lead, well, it's Donald, you know it's fucking dark, but there are some people who stay calm and they go, we know man, let's just take a walk over here and talk about it and you fall for it. Next thing you know, you're out, Brian.

Speaker 2:          01:11:58       No matter if your girlfriends with some other guy, you know, they come rushing into a bar and people were tremendous at that. That's a great gift. You know who can do that shit? Big John Mccarthy, big John McCarthy. Who's the best at like separating shit when shit goes sideways and the octagon, isn't he an ex police officer and he's a giant because the giant. I mean he's a big dude. He's a black belt in Jujitsu and when, when shit gets weird inside the octagon, the cop and hip comes out. People if there's some chaos and some crazy shit, he puts out fucking halt to that no more. Yeah, those guys are important, man. It's important to have people like that. Now that is a skill though is it's a giant skill. It also be a good guy, which he also is like, like big John McCarthy's a hell of a human, by the way. Formally congrats on a thousand men. That's really awesome. Listen, amazing party started. Hey guys.

Speaker 2:          01:13:00       It's really incredible, man. It's probably more right. I think it's like a hundred and 43 or something. Probably real riddick. There's a bunch of other named ones. Fight companions, fight breakdowns. That would never, ever dream when you started doing these meaning either they would have the impact that they have. Let's just keep that shit known. Void. Fucking saying like people want to hear this. I remember him calling me up to the room with me yelling at Joe and like fucking crazy fuckers home on a Friday night. Thirteen year old is. Take that off. Take that shit off when I'm smoking pot. We were in the green room at the peninsula. No, no carbs. No. This was somewhere else. This is doing a podcast. Meet him in red bank. One of the first podcast we did was off this thing called Justin Dot TV. Justin TV and we didn't agree and we did them back when there were cellular modems, so he'd be streaming like there wasn't like a lot of Wifi back then, so we'd be streaming from a cell phone hookup. Yeah, it was terrible. Like real pixilated stuff. But we were like,

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       this could be fucking weird and have people like watch us get ready in the green room talking to the camera. We're just can be bizarre. So we decided to do a few of those, but Joe, he was like, get this fucking thing away from me. But that was, that was the different Joey Diaz back then, you know, you were still uncomfortable. You know, it was funny with that. That was the thing that set you free to let people know who you are. At the beginning when he was like, hey dude, weren't you also like, what the fuck are you doing? No, no, no. I was like, are you like a bird collar kind of guy or something like, I thought it was like one of those weird. You know what I mean? Things that people do though. It was like a bird call. Are we talking about man, he was onto it.

Speaker 1:          01:14:54       He would be on there at night and I just didn't like it. I didn't know, but then Dane Cook became a megastar would my space and everybody in that mother went on. That was before me, but they were not cook. They was doing. They just thought by going on my space and going, I got free tickets tonight. Yeah, that. That was gonna work. They ain't cook. Was communicating with them. True and people would see the communication and go, wow, we can have live interaction, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Dane was doing that way before me. He was doing that on my space and my 2002 or something like that. Right. Wasn't it by the way? Early on. Yeah. What about in 2003? We'll check the lineup. Will check the old calendars. We did the fourth of July weekend in Nirvana and I'll never forget that. I said to you, do you have radio?

Speaker 1:          01:15:40       And you go, I have no radio. I'm a little panicked and that Thursday when we got down to the whole weekend was so good and that's what I said, Joe Rogan's onto something with that fucking computer, like, fuck this shit, because my philosophy was that computer. Do you think Richard Pryor would go home before the morning coked up and get on fucking facebook. That was my thing at that time, like sunglasses, fucking thing, that fucking Richard Price and they go home and get on on my space. So I was exposed it, but once I saw five sold out shows and Irvine, the older vine when it was known that if you didn't do radio, nobody's going to show up there. And that was it. That was it. To me, that was maybe a believer that there's something there. Yeah, it's amazing. The, uh, the range of people that come up to me about your show, you know, like the, like all types of fucking pilots, a fighter I've had like amateur fighters, professional fighters, the range of people that are interested in your show, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          01:16:48       It's a really wide range of people. It's fascinating. Like it's really reached a lot of people. Man. I was freaking me out, man. I was in burbank the other day. Okay, so you got a haircut? We could go. All right. You don't make the. I had, I went to Jujitsu and had a half hour to kill. So before they had cut, I just smoked a joint. I was in my car on Magnolia Boulevard up the block from Porto's, which is fucking back. And I opened up the sunroof and I just started smoking a joint before they had cut and I put a piece of gum in my mouth and I actually walked through the crosswalk to walk across the street and there was a lady holding a kid with another one in the thing and she looked at me and when she looked at me and go, fuck, this lady smells me.

Speaker 1:          01:17:35       You know when you, when you don't have a child, you don't give a fuck about refund. But when you have a child and you see a mom with a child, you feel kind of fucking sorry man. I didn't say it until she looked at me and she goes, oh my God, with the kid in her thing and with the Stroller, she looked at me, she goes, blue cheese with your fucking mother. I loved it. I'm from Buffalo. I looked at her and she just kept walking, but it was like the type of woman that wouldn't say that to me with the kid ended up pushing. She goes, blue cheese with wings and go, fuck your mother. I love you. And She just kept walking. I was like, oh my God. Amazing man. What? What about? I went to Sacramento and families with kids. It's fucking crazy, but the realm of the people, why they come up to you and Tsa?

Speaker 1:          01:18:25       Don't forget about Tsa, Tsa, but the realm of people and the reasons why. That's what I'm saying. That's what the actual, which always killed me. Like I've been around for 20 years and what made you come to my show is I totally shit about. I told the story about taking a shit in somebody's back yard. I loved it. We laughed like you. You're like, oh my God. Yeah. That's what, you know when somebody comes up to me, it's always they came to a show for something different. I said on here. Yeah, you know, that's really weird. It's amazing. And the, like you said, the contrast. It's not just a six foot guy. No, it's everything. Steroid guy. It's a mom with a baby in a stroller. I was saying I have people that so want me to give you things. It's so annoying. They're like, because they always start with like trying to flatter me and like try and they're like, dude, I think you're fucking hilarious.

Speaker 1:          01:19:21       I go, thanks man. I love your shit. I listen to it. I listened to on the way to work every day and I'm like, oh, thanks a lot. And they're like, yeah man, it's so funny. Like I love this bit and that bit and I'll be like, it's very nice you man. Thank you very much. Like, and I listened to your podcast and I fucking love it. It's so fucking funny. I'm like, thank you. And then they're like, hey, will you give this to Joe? That's their, their whole thing like did you think because you told me all those compliments, I'm going to be your messenger and they'd be like, no, I mean, just like if you could give it to them. Okay, sure. I get this request every other week. What kind of weird shit? I tell always fucking packages and envelopes. I don't open.

Speaker 1:          01:20:02       The men could. Yeah. No, they go right. I tell them to send them directly to you and like the cup he gave to him and tell him to do that. He gave me two cups. I gave one to Alberto and I gave one to you. This is a highly ineffective way to communicate with people. I sending them shit, you know, people think that I want to have shit in my car. Like he gives us the time, like I'm going to have this in my fucking car. I got the newest latest Bong. It's totally different than it is a bong. First of all, you can drop it out of an airplane. It will not break. It's military grade, bro. This is the bog. The bog dwindled bongs. The catastrophe apocalypto you've had this pitch ended the world bomb, Bro. This bond is made out of the same shit that Wolverine's claws.

Speaker 1:          01:20:50       There's a closet in my office, guy slide open and I cannot tell you. I must have a 300 black tee shirts from different bands and shit and I got every. I mean look at me. I got every protein, powder, fuel and energy thing that you can come and get me. I got more geese. Most Jujitsu schools. Yeah. That's how many gies a given to me. Mailed to me. I have to mail them back. My wife says, I seen one more fucking. I will throw that shit out. It's just amazing albums because people know I like. I come home with vinyl every fucking week. Really? Some of it is fucking atrocious, but some of it is fantastic. I listened to everything you do. You have a hard time checking out old shit. I feel bad for people. I understand that they've worked for it and I understand that they went out of their way for it, but if I haven't seen Duncan in six months and I got a bullish candle, it goes in the garbage. Like once Dunkin moved to New York, I grew all Duncan's shit. Only saved mushrooms. Mvma for already come up to me and get me heavy drugs for like I will bring it back on the plane for rob because he's my brother. Oh, you know what they come and get some guy gave about a month ago gave me a book about Stars and Oh Jesus. When I looked, he was the author. Like if that gets told everyone. That guy gave me that book and I showed it to you, like how to be a real man.

Speaker 1:          01:22:37       One of his rules was be 40. That'd be a real man. He was just like, we went over it on your podcast, man, that guy for a long time. He gave that to like a bunch of us. We have Hong Kong and he was like, here's this book. I'd rather let me look at it as him on the cover and it's all glossy and he's in. He's looking off to the side and that was when I first did your podcasts. He was the first time I did it. Yeah. That was how many years ago that. That was probably when we started at seven years ago. It was probably five years ago. Yeah. I do get a lot of Nice shit though. Oh yeah. I do get a lot of new. I'm talking about when people might have with the studio who made that thing. A kid in Cleveland thing is good.

Speaker 1:          01:23:24       Uh, I got, I get great books sent to me. I mean, phenomenal money books. I'm reading one right now. That is the creepiest thing. The three lives with Jimmy page from led. Jump on that motherfucker traveled with a 14 year old girl, Bro. Never got charged with statutory rape. Really just traveled with him for years. He's just a runaway on the tour, on the tour, like fucking crazy. He taught me. Is that true? You know, talking about his house and fucking, uh, in uh, where he lived. He bought it from Alice, took it, was Alex to Crowley's all house, a 24 karat warlock. He was, he lived in his house and you know, for some people it was like a way to sell records. Not for those, for those four were onto something magical, you know, they were magical mine albums, but this book kind of like, I got to put it down for two days at a time sometimes. Really? Yeah. He's a fucking nut. That's what's called the three live looking. The 10 wildest led Zeppelin led jazz shit. Scroll this shit down. Joe Rogan. He did a 14 year old. Crazy man. The truth Mannix was amazing. Just 14 when she met page paige page. Did what he could to keep the relationship hidden. Oh, that's true.

Speaker 6:          01:24:46       That's crazy. Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:24:49       That's weird. He was crazy when they shoved the little. What they've shoveled after a baby shark of the schicks pussy was so weird, man. Like you could. You could do that back then, right? Like you could do weird shit back then. Yeah. It makes you stop and think like what that is. It's like the, just the beginning of the information age, right. Newspapers regularly distributed television shows on the news. All that stuff was only like a few decades old when the sixties and the seventies rolled around. I mean, you really think about the timeline there. It's really kind of fascinating. Do you ever think about the jump from in technology from like, you know, like you know how it sites that there was no us weekly there. Right? Right. So things kind of advance and now everything's monitored and now for instance, you can record a phone call. Right? Which is like would be a difficult thing to do back then. Or you can have a recorder running on you. Do you ever think about how that lack, you know, the privacy goes away and how to, to to some degree, we can't even conceive of it right now, but how easy it will be to record everything at some point. Like how it'll, you know, we joked like it's in

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       your watch or it's in your glasses, but it will be like you'll walk out of every conversation and there'll be some, some form to document it. Yeah, it'd be a total loss. So there's gonna be, there's gonna be some changes. I don't necessarily agree are done. I'm not convinced I should say not agree. I'm not convinced that they're going to be bad to do that. Yeah, I, I just, I wonder like what, what, what's gained through this kind of privacy now I'm not talking about like privacy, like corporations or the government being able to look into your life. I'm talking about we might get to a position as human beings within our lifetime where everybody looks into everything about everybody. Everything, right? Finances your day to day life sexually here, seeing you everywhere you go, no matter what you do. Like what we could get to a position where there's no disconnection from any of us, but we're all connected to each other.

Speaker 3:          01:27:05       If this keeps going the way it goes. Right. So it used to be everybody lived far apart and you know, you have to ride a horse to get to the friend, say hi and talk to them and hopefully he's still alive when he came back the next day know. But there was no communication. Then it got two phone calls it in as as things have ramped up and now it's in your phone and now your phone's in your watch and now your watch can tell you who's calling you and you can. You can look at your phone and you see the person start track type shit already happening, right? Yeah, and it's getting deeper and deeper and deeper. People are streaming live streaming live streaming facebook. No matter what they do all day. There's a slew of people paying video games, live streaming. People are tuning in, watching other people play video games.

Speaker 3:          01:27:52       I mean we're getting deeper and deeper into this technological rabbit hole where it becomes embedded in your life in a way that was unimaginable before it was introduced. Same thing as cell phones before cell phones were introduced. Who would have ever believed, if you told them that you were going to get to a point in human history where it is totally common to see people staring at electronic screens while they're all sitting together at a dinner table, that they could be five people sitting around and they not even talking to each other. They're just staring at this electronic screen and that screen is compelling. You know it. I know it. I get drawn to it. You get drawn to it. When that was, man might be some crazy news. Let me check Google real quick. You never know. You never know what weird shit has been happening in the world and you get sucked into this. This thing is becoming a part of your life in a weird way that nobody anticipated. If it keeps going in the direction that it's going, it's going to get weirder in a way we never anticipated before where it's not going to be just as simple as put your phone down and go outside. It's going to be your phone's a part of you. It's going to happen. Your phone's almost a part of you. Now, if you have to have it, like I connected to this

Speaker 1:          01:29:01       goddamn thing more than I touched my dog, right? Total. I love my dog, but I touched that thing more than I'd touch my dog. It's weird. You want to protect. It's not a pardon me man. I could just put it right there right there. Lenses right there. Don't go anywhere. I got you right here. That's basically a part of me. It's basically a part of me. How long before I let them open me up? Still means there's a spot in my armpit. I don't mean use those little. There's a great short about that. There's a great short film about. Yes. What's it called? I don't. I don't remember the name of it, but it ends up like under the guise skin out. It's going to happen. It's really cool. I wish to stay away from this fucking thing. I tradjenta a different room at night.

Speaker 1:          01:29:42       You know the Ipad I bought the right. No fucking facebook. Twitter or not that. Neil Brandon rush on an IPAD. I bought an IPAD. Do you have like one of those little keyboard things you connect to a case like that bro? It's changed my life. I used to have three hours of just shit. Time of day that it's not enough to work out. So what are you writing notes? Use the notes program. What do you. Yeah, I just write and fucking notes and if I don't like the joke that night I can go back and add the tag. You know what's real good. If you ever tried evernote, evernote is real good. It allows you to use pictures, all kinds of different things in black out, everything else. Um, no, no, that's a different thing. That's a right room. But ever note, uh, you, you, if you, uh, write things like the things you want to remember maybe before sets, you can write them down in evernote and then sync them from your ipad to your phone and back and forth.

Speaker 1:          01:30:36       It's really good. It's one that I use. I just got this ipad pro for three weeks ago and it's changed my life. Yeah, that's, it changed my life. I could give a fuck about twitter, facebook hot, nothing. When I go to that coffee shop, the right, it's just that program. I have everything else in there, but I haven't even program. I have the apps that I got my fitness plan and they're like a bjj training adrenaline and that's it. You know what I said about the Internet, man, I think about the Internet, like I think about foods that are sweet, like you can have them as long as you don't have too much, too much, don't get crazy. That's how I feel about even going online. I think we're. We're, we're, we're getting to this weird point where we're just relinquishing our, our consciousness to this machine, relinquishing our consciousness connection that we all enjoy.

Speaker 1:          01:31:27       It's not a consciousness. It's the consciousness. We're all sharing about a certain topic. We all have to interject on what we think about Charlottesville or about trump and stuff like that. These days you get on facebook and twitter and you're fucking sad. You get sad. You get sad for people. Okay. I make it a habit. Friday, Saturday, and Sundays. No reason to be on the Internet. You have to stay away from it. There's no reason that the shows are sold out. Your family's at home. What? What are you only go there? This is my. This is my cheeseburger. Yeah. I give a fuck. So on the weekends I don't touch it. I forced myself, don't touch it for what? You have to have a life, man. Yeah, we are. We are forgetting that there's a life. You ever go to a park and look at these fucking parents looking at their phones.

Speaker 1:          01:32:17       You call it a park where your kid don't you? Yeah. I don't take my phone out of the car. The park. There's no recall. You, your manager tell you they changed your spot at the store from 10, 15 to 10:30. If you're with your kid and your wife, you don't need your phone. You really don't show. You got to get into floating man. How come you home float? Because I smoked pot and I think of this shit on my own. Yeah, but it's different. That's why it's not. It's not what you're thinking. I can anxieties. Yeah, but you'll be fine. Becky works at the place in Pasadena and we've been talking about a lot about it. I'm really scared about these little dabs of anxiety that I get from time to time. You'll be fine. It's good for your health. No. I know it's good for my health, but when I go get good blood with your dad to go blood, no problem.

Speaker 1:          01:33:05       Wait, does weed make you more anxious or less anxious and smoothing into out. Okay. So then when it comes to certain things I have to see a window. Like it's really weird and right now there's not a window in it but I see that fucking door. Like when I walk up the steps at the original room and I get anxiety when a comics on stage. It could be any, it can be an open microphone. I'm next and I start getting this, the shortness of breath. I have to turn around and look down the stairs at the comedy store just by me knowing that I could get out if shit goes down. I'm okay. Hm. So I don't think a fucking tubs got windows are floating tank. They seal that thing over here, you know, they don't seal. It's just, that's what I'm a little scared of it.

Speaker 1:          01:33:49       I'm not claustrophobic either. I was in the cell. None of that shit bothers me. I just got to see a window. Yeah. Well listen, it's, it's real easy, like when you're in it, it's right there. You just lift your hand up and it's right there. The door's right there. I know we had to stand up. You open the door. It's on your hat. You know, look what happened yesterday and in Barcelona. What a fucking shame. You can't conduct terrorist attacks to isolation. Well, let me ask you a question, Joe Rogan. I even know that I asked you a question. My brother, you were an intelligent individual. You're an intelligent individual, pumps or Jamie, you're not a fucking Phi Beta Kappa, but you know, Jamie might be the smartest guy in the random. I'm just teasing you, Jamie. How many people were looking down when they got hit by that car yesterday?

Speaker 1:          01:34:33       Let's be honest. 60 five people got hit, but you know, that's, you know, people are start paying attention as Americans. You cannot live in that fucking thing no more. We cannot. It's not smart. It's not smart to be walking around staring up fucking. But sometimes you have to look at it. Oh, there's, there's times where like someone of course sends you an address, you're meeting people there. Then there's times you catch yourself. You're like, what am I going? What am I doing? All three of us have children. Do we want our children to grow up on a fucking computer? Do we want them to have both? They're going to grow up on computers. You're not going to. I, I want them to grow up in computers, but I don't want that whole lifestyle to be on the computer. I want them to go outside. I want them to get dirty.

Speaker 1:          01:35:21       I want them to have life experiences. Even if you know, the only way you learn about life is sometimes by having a negative, something negative happening. So true. Then these children that are on my computer to the 18, then they send them away and they fucking fractured. Yeah, fractured with two different time now for children guys and we're parents. It's a different time. It's way different. It's different in the way that I don't think anybody's ever seen before, so they don't know what the fuck. What the fuck to do Tom Scott under p lookout? Slimiest. Beautiful, beautiful, sexy. I try and keep it as normal as I can. I try to keep it as normal as I can. I never want to forget who the fuck I am. Joe Rogan and I don't want to forget it for my children. My daughter, you know, I don't want them to be.

Speaker 1:          01:36:08       I was driving home and I saw a little girl selling lemonade with her mom on the corner was 2000 degrees and in studio city I pull up to my house. I go inside and get my daughter and I get the, my, my wife. Let's go buy some fucking eliminated from this kid. All right. My daughter's going to kindergarten next year at a school that's rated one of the highest schools, but it's a public school approach. Kids go there, a bunch of kids go. There is no reason to put your kid in these Notre Dame's and all these $25,000. They want $34,000 a year for kindergarten. Why come on Joe Rogan? What? Well, how is your child going to benefit? Come on. We're all intelligent here. That's $24,000, monarch, Notre Dame, all the other schools in the valley. They want 30 gs, two g registration form to sign your kid in.

Speaker 1:          01:36:59       Really joke. People want to keep their kids say no, that's not safe, and so you could tell your friends that your kids are fucking that school. That's a little bit of size. Hold on. My kids attend and you're like, oh my God, you're kidding. Attempt to be a fucking dummy because he's in school with other rich people's fucking kids and they're all fucking dummies to you know that getting raised by Nannies. I don't want that. I don't. I go to the park. How many fucking white kids do you see where Mexican women, they got a fucking shame. The Mexican women are adopting the white kids at fucked up. That's why they didn't want to build a wall because you got to raise their own fucking kids. That's why these white people didn't want Mexicans to go. California was going to raise their fucking kids swimming coach. I go to a swimming class Thursdays with my daughter jumping in front. There's no more white parents take of

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       their nannies. I run the fucking wire MCA with their kids. When your kid grows up and he's. What's his name? My goal, Napa. Low Mile. You know when he was one of those, don't come crying to me. Don't come to me and let me tell you something. The pacifier, I was raised to be a little cock sucker, but I snapped out of it. Somewhat know when my father died, when I was one of those little boys. You see what that mom holding onto that leg? No, go. I was one of those little fucking faggot kids. Okay. I stuck the pacifier until the age of six. Oh my God. Okay. I hope I had potential to be one thing. One fucking thing. You understand me? But my mother would not allow that shit that happened. Don't Latin mothers don't play that Shit. You know what I'm saying? Oh yeah. Latin mothers do not allow that shit. I couldn't wear scarves. You know? It was on the west coast. We wanted to wear a scarf, like a snoopy scarf, like flags.

Speaker 2:          01:38:52       Like I was going to go fly a plane scarf or what's it like one of those Randy coture scarves? Which although I wouldn't where I think on him as quite fetching. No, no scarves. No. You ever see the Randy coture scarf? Yeah. Randy called Torah will. Where would I would call a tactical scarf. Oh, like that. See, that's the kind of scarf that like a navy seal would where randy wears a bunch of those things. But Randy is such a bad motherfucker. It's almost like he's begging you to try to choke him. What that thing can come. Come and try to grab that thing. I just leave. That should be the name of that album right there. That should be his album. Cover scarf. Scarf. It's crazy. He's such a nice guy. A rennies or anything. You know what? And His kid, his kid, uh, came to my show in Vegas and also has like a, a gym that coolest, coolest kid man.

Speaker 2:          01:39:49       Like him and his wife, I think both teach there too. Oh Wow. Nice. Nice man. His son, his son is. Yeah, I think he was fighting in the world series of fighting, which is now, now is a new name, but yeah, he fought for a bunch of different people. Right. To fight for strike force. Now think he might've fought for Bella tour. Ryan coture, talented fighter it. While we're at it. Don't forget to remind you as fucking Gino giving you the CBD Roll-on on yet. Yes. What do you think? It's amazing. How does that even work? Is that Buddha dogs? I came home, I scored it like a cream. You Rub it on like spotify for my wife moves. You really get out of the shower, done it gets in weird spots. Dog must have some sort of anti inflammatory properties or something like that. Do you like that? Tie? Lindemann. Everybody. Anybody ever rubbed that stuff on? You know, like ties, like Thai boxers and shit. They're like, you got to realize they're always dealing with like bones slamming into their legs and they're all sore and shit and they rubbed this tie. Linament. It's weird. It's like Kiehl's

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       valley stuff. I don't think it heals up man, but it makes sure it feels good. It's a similar one. Tiger Balm. Like that girl Shit. I have another thing. It's called something juice and when I was a kid I used to have the I am poem bag and I rubbed it on my hands and do the I am poem technique and Shit. With that it's called something that has a weird smell to it. Like does this stuff do like when? When, when that stuff like heats your skin up and you're like, Oh God, like a icy hot. Like that kind of shit. What does that really doing? I have no idea. I think it's just tricking you into thinking. So yeah, I don't think it really is someone who's a friend of mine who's a doctor described it as a topical analgesic, meaning that it, it does something to the surface of your skin, but maybe is it psychological that makes you feel like it's healing up?

Speaker 3:          01:41:40       Like when you have a muscle soreness or something like that, like if you have like a wound, a little injury, there's a psychology psychological aspect to that heat and stuff. I feel like you think you're getting work done. You know, there's probably a psychological aspect to healing in general. I don't think it's 100 percent, but I think you could sway it in a better direction. Yeah. You know, I mean like that's got to be what the placebo effect is, right? They tell you they're going to give you a pill and it's gonna make you feel bad and you're like, oh, this is it. This is the thing they gave me. The gave me the pill, and you actually do feel better and even show signs of recovery, like immediately corresponding to you taking that pill. Like your brain is convinced yourself. What about that dude you've had on the podcast who's brain is like a fucking healing serum who can walk Wim Hof?

Speaker 3:          01:42:29       Yeah. Wim Hoff. Oh yeah, dude, he's. I mean, he treats people. He teaches people how to do it. He's as legit as they get. He holds the world record for swimming under ice ice. Yes, and by the way, he fucked up and couldn't figure out which way to get out because his retinas had frozen over because the water was so cold. How does he do this? He's an an em all. He's a fucking savage. That guy in the most beautiful sense of the word, he just has incredible breath control. That's a big part of his whole entire philosophy. So the guys following this rope once he's committed to it, by the way, like he's just got these little spots along the way where he can get some air, but he lost track. He couldn't see good anymore because it was so god damn cold. He couldn't figure out where the exit is, so he went more than the full distance. That was his goal in the first place, which was insane. All of it's insane. Oh, fucking name, man. I mean that guy is something special. He teaches people, which is the crazier part even to me that he's. He's gotten people train them to swim in freezing water, walk through ice, and also fight off a cold. Yes, yes. Fuck me, I use his breathing technique before going on stage and when I do I have better shows.

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       This is what I think. I think you looked Kinda hyperoxygenate and stimulate your mind how sophisticated breathing tick. Well it's a lot of what he does that I find beneficial is like, and I've heard this concept in yoga before too, is breathing in like take a giant breath and letting out, excuse me, letting on about 20 percent and then breathing in again as hard as you can, let it out about 20 percent breathing in as hard as you can and then continue that for like long periods of time. Dude, I do that in the Cryo tank where I stand in the cold air. Yeah, three minutes goes by like that. There's a giant difference between when I do that and when I don't do that. So you focus on your breathing, it's a little bit of that. There's definitely, there's something about people that are encountering any sort of stimulation where it's real hard to manage the stimulation without letting everything get fucking crazy and haywire and being able to manage it has a gigantic effect on what the actual results or the actual experience of being this cold.

Speaker 2:          01:44:57       It's because it gets the same goddamn thing, but if you can control your breath and control your consciousness and you're doing something that seems to be heating up your body to and a little bit of a way, almost like an internal exercise because it's difficult to do because you're taking these big giant breasts of cold air and then you're letting out a little and then you take it a big giant breath. It's almost like you're flexing your lungs and when you do that man, I mean it might make it 20, 30 percent easier to deal with three minutes supposedly. I'm not kidding. One of the Olympics, I don't know what year it is. If you'd like to check whether the Russians beat the fuck out of the Americans. Supposedly Americans came out walking you the flag and the Russian Joel Cave. I'm going, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. And they couldn't figure out what the fuck is wrong with these motherfuckers.

Speaker 2:          01:45:47       That's what they were doing. They warm up their lungs, looked back to think about what they're about to do, the technique they're about to use, and to let the blood go to the back of something fucking weird. I read about that was pretty interesting. Whether it's true or not, I don't know, but supposedly that cardio was so ahead of the United States because they were doing a pre breathing exercises. Thinking had something to do. Now is that the guy that also has the record for the deepest drop? I think it's a different guy, a different guy, a different guy. He's the one that I wrote that I read about. He used the one that wrote about about how you have to prepare for all that stuff and that it was learned when the Russians came up at the. It's interesting to focus on your breath, like I don't do it much. I do. I actually been doing polities and it's way fucking harder than I thought it was gonna be, but be like, you're thinking about your breath for like an hour. Basically. You're always. You're always working on your breath. There's not. It's not a secret

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       that like the greatest Jujitsu guy of all time had this crazy breath control. Really Hixon Gracie. He had. There's a bunch of videos of him. He received a documentary choke. You ever heard of it? No. It's an amazing documentary about this Guy Hixon Gracie, who's almost universally regarded as the greatest Jujitsu player of all time and fought a bunch of fights in mma and strangled everybody fought, but he. There's this video where he's doing this yoga warm up sort of thing that he would do every day and he does this thing with his stomach that you watch them do this and it starts warming his stomach up. He's doing this like fire breathing shit, but then he starts sucking his stomach into like the upper corners of his rib cage, like rhythmically in this like almost impossible thing. Like can you watching them doing it? Like he's warming everything up and then once he gets it warmed up, you starts wiggling the internals.

Speaker 3:          01:47:48       But look at this man. Who the fuck has that kind of control of your abdominal muscles to do this? Every time he trained, he did it all the time. Did it constantly. He did this, he did yoga constantly. Gymnastics. He did a type of yoga called a gymnastic gun, not trial, which is a Brazilian. I'm a sort of a, um, a combination of yoga and a lot of movements like rolling and animal, like movements, natural movements, amazing stuff. See if he could find the guy who created that gymnastica natural. So you give the guy credit because there's a really amazing style carriers. Yes. So her into gymnastics as a couple of Brazilian guy teaching decimals is actually so much more bad ass than it's given credit for Jiu Jitsu. No, no, I'm talking about like gymnast's for sure. Or even like yoga masters. Oh yeah. Physical ability is so beyond.

Speaker 3:          01:48:50       I think most people's perception of it when they first, you know, think about it. Like, yeah, fucking Psychos, man. Professor Alvarado Romano is the guy who created gymnastic unnatural and uh, that was Hickson's thing and there's videos of him doing it, doing it on the beach. There's a video of Hicks and doing it, and um, you watch the movements and you go, oh, this is almost like he's having, like, it's almost like shadow fighting with Jujitsu because you're being able to put your body in these weird positions over and over and over again to balance yourself, saw a bunch of controlling your body in any weird way that you could possibly encounter a position where you'd have to be strong wild shit because he was way ahead of the curve man. There was everybody back then was to, in Mexican supplements and Dead Lifts and bench pressing and fucking running over each other and training camp, beating the shit out of each other.

Speaker 3:          01:49:47       And Hickson was just strangling people. You know, it's really a fascinating thing when you stop and think about it, that this one guy was the best and so far ahead of the curve. And so few people, even people that really got into Jujitsu, saw, well, first of all, he had amazing talent as dad was Leo, grace it. Those are two giant factors, but also the way he trained and the way he controlled his breath and his own son, Kron Gracie was world champion or the best grapplers in the world can do all that stuff too, has massive breath control and he'll tell you, it's all about your breath. Like being able to control your breath is a massive part of your anxiety levels to massive part of how you can deal with stress, how you can calm yourself down. You have control and power over your lungs. What does this too?

Speaker 1:          01:50:38       Oh, this is another. He's out there in the jungle. This guys actually doing it in the jungle. Jacques already does a lot of that stuff. We all breathe naturally will make. If you look at your children, they are breathing the way that we're supposed to breathe somewhere with 10 or 12 or become a teenager. Yeah, we go off like my breathing was complete. I went to seminars. I went to digital. Really, when I went to Jujitsu, I created so much fear in my mind from being on my back that I would immediately run outside and take my gear off and pee my pants and people would quit. Like I just pay a little bit of my short term. Most people would have quit. Yeah. I don't like that feeling. Yeah. So I kept going back and I wouldn't improve. I would improve because of my car.

Speaker 1:          01:51:26       Yeah. I had been smoking joints for 30 years. Yeah, I'm a fat fuck. Yeah, it was that I had a bill, but like I had to get Bob's route, his mouthpiece to build my diaphragm just to suck. I had no therapy. All of this because of Jujitsu is legit. The boss routing thing is legit. When I hit the bag, I use the bus route and thing. Yeah. I think what they're saying is the best way to use it. Just use it and it's an exercises exercise. Use It, use it like an exercise. So let's do a few things with it and just blow some air out with it. Like really good. It's really helped me, but that's how much I learned about like I now I don't have as much anxiety. I breathe it out. It really fucking. So I've done a lot of reading about it, but that guy's article, but the guy that dipped the longest, his was the most interesting.

Speaker 1:          01:52:13       I didn't know about the fucking license shit, but it's true, man. Once you. Now I'm rolling and now I pulled guard with time just to be on my back. I want to be fearful. Yeah. So I just couldn't. I just look back whenever I have a problem. I do a thing called who got hula bowl that the Indians did Hulu, where you look, hookah, hookah, Lou, something like that. Oh, who could allow hookah lounge where you look up and you center again. Yeah. That's helped me become a better comment sometimes up there talking shit and just center yourself and all these little things I learned because I joined Jujitsu like my breathing or I focus on it when I rolled. Now I don't care about hands no more. I don't care if you're choked me. I really don't give a fuck. I'm horrible anyway. I'm just, I'm just learning to breathe all over it, you know, I'm just learning to breathe, you know, you know, I was grabbing you and trying to go for a cross collar and then fucking like doing something completely different for assistant sweep and somebody like Joe.

Speaker 1:          01:53:15       You got to exhale brother. Do you do, do, do, do a yoga for Jujitsu? Don't they have a class like shit down at um, schools? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we do. I go early. What's the name of the actual thing is called TAC fit. But I go to yoga with my wife once a week. We'd just go there. She goes four times. I just go with the Tuesday one just to loosen up from 10 to 11. I'm not that good at it. My rich fit is our friends tack for this or Scott Sewn and fuzzy when they realized who he did the podcast with me fucking happen. A tremendous workshop. This wreck ain't fucking nine to five every day. Shit. Saturday and Sunday. Are they teaching you? Kettlebells meets club bells with glossy and how it affects Jujitsu and mma and stuff like that. So last week I got to meet Scott Simon and boy, he's fucking great joe.

Speaker 1:          01:54:07       He's got a lot of great stuff about bell's yes, scraping some of his videos. Listen, I'm up to the 20 pounds from Barbara. Yeah. I started when I first got the club bells from heartbreak. My wrist was hurting with five pounds. I couldn't even do the simple five pounds one. Now I'm taking twenties, holding them, going all the way back, bringing them back and it's all focused on my back and breathing. That's it. I just threw shit to breathe. Now I don't give a fuck if I get beat up because that's what was really bothering me was the breathing and maybe getting better at it. Yeah. But now I'm getting better at it. Plus the sleep apnea had put a lot of fear. So being on my back and being out of breath, have sleep apnea would kick in again. You got fucking, you know. So

Speaker 3:          01:54:51       do you ever do those shield casts? What's that? Remember the iron sheik. Remember the iron sheik used to hold up those gigantic, a Iranian clubs that they would use for wrestling training. It's like it was a really strong move for wrestling training, see if he could find what would the iron sheik cause he was like the iron sheik people don't know. He was a pro wrestler in the wwe. He was wwf back then and you know, he was before he was that he was a super successful Iranian amateur wrestler. He was a legit wrestler, like legit wrestling skills and ridiculously strong and he's holding these things and I don't know how much these things way, but they, it doesn't look like he's faking this because of the slow motion of how he's moving in. They look like heavy objects. I don't know how much they weigh, but this is a really hard workout to do.

Speaker 3:          01:55:46       You know, I, I can barely do that shit with like 15 pounds and I'm not bullshitting with one hand. It's hard. It's a weird control thing. And you realize like how you're strong in certain areas as a definitely heaviest, heaviest fuck yeah. You're strong in certain areas. Like that guy is super jacked. Who is that? Got Beautiful underwear. Um, but it's, it's a very difficult thing because you could be really strong when it comes to like a straight shoulder press, you know, like you could like hoist up like 70 pounds, but there's no fucking way in the world you're going to be moving around 70 pounds of fat. You're just, you just can't do it. Your arm's going to fall off. Like if you have, especially if you have it in the form of a club, like you can't even get close. Like I can do a lot of shit with heavy kettle bells.

Speaker 3:          01:56:34       But when it comes to like one of those clubs, I'd take two hands to move around a 30 pound one, which is like if someone says like 30 pounds, like do you bench press $30 Bro. That's all we got here. Thirty pounds bro. I can't even get up pump doing something with one of these clubs. That's 30 pounds is fucking insane. Saying you have to be so God damn strong. And that sounds weird because it seems like, well 30 pounds is 30 pounds, but when you start swinging that shit over your head and it's long. And so like the leverage is going against you look at him like a fucking bulldozer too. He was a bulldozer guy that's on twitter calling everybody and everybody's all my dates, Nazis. I retweeted them the other day about Nazis. I love him. I was onstage with him in Toronto is one of my favorite moments as a human calm people that you're bronies called everybody a piece of shit. I fucking hated everybody. He was a good man though. And he was a stud wrestler. But there's the dark secret of not just professional wrestling but of I'm just real high, real high level grappling. So the damage that gets done to a lot of those guys bodies is almost unfixable. And he's all fucked up now he's got, you know, like flares, like not in a coma, but in the last four or five days. I heard about that. And how old is Rick Flair?

Speaker 3:          01:57:55       You know? Um, they pay a price, they pay a price to, to entertain in that way, know it's very, very physically violent. It just, because it's not quote unquote a real fight, whereas like there's an unplanned outcome and they're just throwing haymakers at each other, like a real mma fight. Just because it's not. That doesn't mean that they're not taking in a lot of damage. Hit with those fucking forearms. Shivers and dropped a fucking chair on them. Like all that shit is fucking them up. A lot of them had brain damage to a lot of it. I'm sure there's no sugar, there's no studies on it, but I'm sure I'm sure some of them avoided it. You know, some of them fought smart. And what is he saying? What is that boy saying? His Song? I thought it was Halloween. Well, this is a drop bees silo. What does

Speaker 2:          01:58:41       he say? Ghetto boys. What was that like? Oh my God, I haven't heard that in so long. What song is that? Oh, it's a halloween song, right? We with chicken up the place. What's that face? Somebody playing tricks on me. Yeah, that's. It wasn't no more than every seven feet, whatever. We triple team them, dropping them motherfucking bed. The more I do, the more I swung, the more blood flow. Debbie disappeared and then my boys disappeared too. Wow. That's a classic man. Oh my God. Bushwick bill. Ladies and gentlemen, remember the cover? The cover of a ghetto boy CD is Bushwick. Bill with his eye shot out in the fucking. Not, not even this one. It's another one in the Gurney. The hospital and it's like we can't be stopped. Is the name of the album he got shot. Delirious man. I think he shot himself in the.

Speaker 2:          01:59:49       I don't even know what the fuck happened. Someone shot him in the eye and he's like, we can't be stopped. And he's in the Gurney, like look at this. Oh yeah, right. Damn. Yeah. So he's on the phone. He's got one of them breaks. He's got one of them brick cell phones from the olden days, from back in the Gordon Gekko days. Guys on playing games and so he got shot in the eye and while that's happening he's on the phone doing deals. Do deals still doing deals and it was the comments they had because they were pushing this. Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Why don't we pick up pictures? We could put this up. Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo. We got to take a picture of this. Let me take this off right quick. Let me take this bandage off right quick. Oh my God, man. Yeah. The WHO's the midget? That's, that's horrible nomenclature, sir. I, I don't think John Wesley, John Wesley, and saw him fucking changing the flat one to Houston and he pulled over to help Bushwick bill was. How cool was that? I helped Bushwick bill. I met. Well, he did a show once he came to a show. Didn't you? Skipped one of my favorite quotes all the time. He got a little hobby of, whoa. It's totally. He's totally right. And he really did. Shoot is io really did. Oh yeah. That wasn't a publicity stunt. Look at that. Damn. That's crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:01:14       Imagine that face walking up to you. They were like at a store and just be like, I'm a celebrity. God fucking ice shot out. They were fucking huge at one time. Geto boys for sure, to live crew that we can't be stopped. We can't be stopped as a big fucking album. They were huge. No, I used to listen to them when I was on the treadmill master a fucking stairmaster things. Whatever. The. His rap a lot. Right. And isn't that the Houston a label? Wasn't that rap a lot? They put us on the map. Rap a lot. That's exactly what it was. That's right. Because the white dude with the teeth. Oh, Paul Wall. He still makes teeth. Teeth. Does he make grills? He makes great show. You should get Paul Wall grills. We should all get grilled. That's a good idea. For Real. That's a great Christmas and some death squad was let. Let's fucking do it. Will you do it please? Please do it. How many teeth? How many teeth? Let's just get a row, man. Let's just do around when we go to Paul. What's up Joe Rogan? One thousand days. You've got your lips. No, it's fine man. What if it gets hooked up on your wife's push? That's cool too. If it's diamonds should be fooled with it.

Speaker 2:          02:02:35       For the denture grills, how much denture grills? Let's see that. What's the cost on that? Those are the ones you slide right off. Fucking diamond grill cheese. What about people that want to be diamond page? Twenty 400. That's not bad. Twenty $400 for jewelry and your teeth. Just to let everybody know you're not playing by any. You're definitely right. If you meet a dude and he's a number of gold teeth, like the number of gold teeth, he as direct proportion as to whether or not he's a pirate. Dude, shoot your next special. Wearing these motherfuckers. Let people know what time it is, man. I'm serious. J R dot e dot and then put the name of the special in the bottom. I need a hype man. I've been thinking to call you on this. Would love to figure out like what's my best strategy. I'm trying to hype out.

Speaker 2:          02:03:23       Is that a word? You know what I would do as soon as you hit like a big punchline, I will go and that was fucking funny to get them wrapped up. You fucking John. What he makes her. You just showing up and going. Yeah. Yeah, a lot. Like 50 grand fucking I'm sure man. Well, wasn't John Stays pay was like Paris Hilton was like, one of the biggest things she had was like those nightclub appearances. She'd go and they would just pay her the money. Yeah, just to just show up and I ended up for some guy gave her a club. It was called club Paris. Every one was supposed to come show up and like she was supposed to be there every weekend. She's not going to Orlando every weekend obviously. So is that the idea that he had? How cooked up are you when you get in business with Paris Hilton? I got an idea. I'm going to give her a club. Is that cool? They see it. You see the connection. If you're. If you're hearing this guy who made that deal. I'm sorry, I'm just joking around. I don't really think that one day we'll fucking that like when we first go into the comedy store sunset, when you hit Laurel Canyon, it was bumper to bumper traffic. Right? Okay. It was bumper

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       to bumper traffic. I remember getting a ticket one time because I had my spot was up. I just want it in the Middle Lane. There was a cop right there. Fucking wait with me by the standard, you know, that was when Hilton and what's the other chick that was getting in trouble? Lindsay Lohan. She's got locked out every fucking nice true causing problems. And then Lindsay Lohan and went to the griddle before court. One day she went to that place that we went to the breakfast place, a good place and that was it. After that, the griddle was packed for fucking months after that because people found out lindsay was only going there for breakfast every morning and they had those crazy pancakes. Pancakes. I mean, but I'm saying that it's like 18 pancakes. I'm wondering like there's your pancake nuts kill you, kill you. Take care of for you. Like 15 years ago there was French Press.

Speaker 1:          02:05:29       They were fucking years ago. Yeah, friends. Yeah. Fifteen years ago. They had coffee from Hawaii there. They were doing a good job there. I just don't like waiting on line. Fags, Bro. I'm anti waiting on line. I'm not waiting in line for a restaurant. I mean when something kind of reasonable fine. Obviously it's like your table. You don't have a table used to hang out, but when they're like, this place is awesome. Just hour and a half now. Ever done. Franklin's barbecue in Austin stayed in line. I'm not paying somebody $8 an hour. Get My fucking hell and come out and get more fucking waitresses. The one cent hamburger place, they do it. They got people out there I don't like. I think it's just a place to be cool. Some people sit there for eight bucks an hour for you already likes that Shit. Doesn't sit in there and listen. Nothing. I don't want to wait for nothing.

Speaker 1:          02:06:18       When I go to breakfast and Hollywood, if I got to go to the doctor, I stopped by the griddle first before I get there. It's still a little wine, but if they give me any drama, there's a Bagel place across the street that's tremendous to get a nice clean Turkey, bobby that make fresh Turkey and pull on your Bagel, bobby and he fucking around Jack. The best wizard job at all. Hollywood is pinks. Yeah. That's the worst day. They are damned wizard. Horrific. I remember horrific coming like moving here to the first thing you do and you're like, wow, I hit that spot. That line again. You get one of those hot dogs. He went all dark during the hot dogs. No, actually you actually bought into it and you're like, this is amazing. And then. Well then you take. Then you take another bite and you're like, no, I, I just, I just hype myself wanting to take a minute. Yeah, but listen, fuck us. That place is crowded every God damn near every day. No. It's about cooking outdoors to having that open window. When she walked by and you could see them cooking the hot dogs. I went in there and the buttons were pink. The bunge were yellow. The Chili was God awful. You know what the problem is? God awful. The real problem for me is always going to be that I've had real New York

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       hot dog snap when you bite them bread, you know there's those type of hot dogs that they were making. The buns were perfect. Lungs go so far with Burgers, amazing things, but there's something about when you snap into one of those and you taste that real fresh, real delicious hot dog tastes like a regular bullshit hot dogs. They just don't fly anymore. Like when you go to dodger stadium, those are the worst hot dog ever know Adam curls and some sort of a beef with fans about that. If a dog's, it's God awful. It's like you read. Don't feel from American Airlines. Think you're poisoning yourself. Every time I get the oatmeal from America and I'm like, am I fucking poison? Those dodger dogs are so fucking bad. They're horrible. I don't give a fuck what anybody says when I was in the

Speaker 1:          02:08:28       from junior year. Uh, what's that word?

Speaker 2:          02:08:34       Excoriates. He excoriates the dodger dog. Implores ramps to serve better beef. What does that word have you ever used?

Speaker 1:          02:08:42       Lord, wow, whoever you are, word wizard of Google. My junior year in high school, Mr Hildebrand took us to the fucking sad brett place to take this through a little walk, you know, because his job was to do is to every month to show is different career opportunities and we went to this, this hotdog thing that like we had to take a bus down there. Have you ever seen that? No. Okay. So this for Puerto Rican and about boobs and they got yellow suits on and they got those boots on. Okay. And there's a fucking I could, you know when you're working on a construction site and you throw the sheet rock in the tube and the tube goes down to the first floor into the dumpster. Okay. So there's a tube like that. And then this for Puerto Ricans were brewing and then six Puerto Rican with bags of 80 pounds. Ninety pounds salt. This is back in 1980. Okay. Ninety pounds and there's pallets of 90 pounds at every once in a while, but light turns red and this thing just body parts start falling heads, shoulders, eyeballs. You just see it and then these guys, the other Puerto Rican break the bags of salt and put them on this shit that's folly, like it's not stopped and these guys sweep that into a fucking hole and that's how the hot dog gets. But it's everything. It's the leg the whole time,

Speaker 2:          02:10:19       you know? What do you think? What happens to her leg when somebody gets into a car? So the four or five when you think happens to the leg, you think they'd take it home? Fuck No. They call Hormel Hormel. We got a black leg for you. It's about three pounds.

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       I will call you back in five minutes. Then they call white castle lizard, but we have a deal for you. Then they hang up with him and they call state comes and they send that Lego thing do with that big fucking leg that weighs 300 pounds. You think they just put that leg away? Fuck no, that's you.

Speaker 1:          02:10:56       Could you imagine if they found out that people were, were grinding up people, they found them

Speaker 5:          02:11:02       morgue dogs. If that was true, the male will kill him and he had a friend that had a supermarket but owed them money, so at night he'd go kill them in the supermarket and put them in the meat grinder and the next day people come in and put that meet. What the fuck were you eating when it was over in net? Fuck he ground Plato's leftover in there? Yeah, for a couple of a couple of his murders. He had a guy that don't want the money for Shylock and he was like a. It wasn't any training. People training people training them upside down and training people. The other guy from the Gambia and I was on the chain

Speaker 1:          02:11:36       supermarkets, you know that. That was the guy from the gambling. The other guy from the Gambinos owned great web, great white auto memo. When you're in queens and shit, they have those people that balance your tires and shit. All them was that bought into legit businesses. That was a good way to declare income. Yeah. I think I had the guy that the the heavy guy conti is something. That guy was a known heroine dealer. He was on the board of Director of news bombs of a supermarket you want me to say with this motherfucker that they had about 30 rest their head about 30 supermarkets in the Jersey area and one day he just called local two. Oh, two carpenters and said, do me a favor, go to every supermarket and add an aisle.

Speaker 1:          02:12:20       So every supermarket had an aisle that whatever they took went directly to the mom. But. So they had 13 supermarkets were like on number five, wasn't really on number five. Nobody knew about number five. So whatever was bought in that aisle, that cash went upstairs for 13 supermarkets on a daily basis. They would just go into a supermarket and it had two lanes go. We don't even worry about those two lights. Wow. How fucking bizarre is that? Yeah. Yeah. Just, it's crazy that the FBI, all the people, various law enforcement organizations figuring out a way to crack that, break it down. They cracked it after they made 10 million. Then they cracked it. You know, lives in studio city, Bro, who? I just met him at the coffee shop about three months ago. And I talk to them all the time and I'm about to sic 'em loose on people sick.

Speaker 1:          02:13:14       I'm loose on people who. The last godfather in this country was a guy by the name of Joe, something big fat guy. He came out and he may never be shut. He was fucking genius. Joe came out of jail, man, everybody's shut. The social clubs, everybody had to have a job. Everybody had to have a job, no drugs. Everybody stuck to it. They were doing phenomenal. He was doing phenomenal Joe Massino, but somebody was shaking down a restaurant and he went in there and they were giving him $20,000 a week for security. So they couldn't figure out how to get Messina because he wasn't doing anything outside. And they got this forensic accountant to go in there and they shut down the mine. This guy, well this guy retired lives in fucking studio city. We were talking to one day goes for a thousand bucks. So it gives you a hard time.

Speaker 1:          02:14:04       You have the right to go in there and look at their books. He goes, don't bring. No, he's fucking white. It is from Hollywood, bring me because I'll find everything in there. Plus I'm making a deal. If they don't pay it, I call my friends at the fucking irs and I will have him here within a day looking through your ass hole. So we're ready to sick mother fuckers. I got one guy I'm ready to say, come on. He keeps telling me, Oh, we haven't made any money. Keep it up. Keep it up because I'm going to stick this little fucking. And this guy is one of those. He's not even Jewish. He's just crazy and white, but for a thousand bucks he'll go in there and he was the same guy that brought down thousands of people for the FBI. When they can't figure you out forensic accounting, you're done the math better add up Jack Jesus.

Speaker 1:          02:14:52       Correct. So anybody who gives you guys a hard time, we don't know. We haven't sold a lot of them. Thousand Bucks and he'll go in there and he's fucking. When you look at him, he's one of those white dudes that did 30 years in the marines that he's pretty serious. He goes, I'll rip them fucking open for you. Oh, I'll find every dime and then I'll make them an offer they can't refuse that. They got three days to give you a check for the UN, whatever. Or we contact our buddies and the irs now having met in 24 hours to look in your asshole until they find something or is that true? Can you really do that? Whatever the fuck you call the irs and go, hey man, watch your ass or wait till you see the end of the year. We went to all these people who've been talking shit about trump.

Speaker 1:          02:15:36       You think Kathy Griffin's they're not going to get harassed and anybody else you watch. I don't trust trump when it comes to something like that. I'm not saying he's a bad dude or anything like that, but I'm saying is trump's one of those dudes. You really don't want to mess with it. I believe that. I believe that if people want to put pressure on you, they could get you to the irs. I think agencies had been doing it for years. I shouldn't even trump. What did you guys think of this Charlottesville stuff and his reaction to it? I think he's just a big failure man. I mean he. What was he, what did you feel like when he fumbled on what I thought was two levels, like, so there's the, there's the leadership like presidential level, right where you go, like this is the office that we look to and then there's the person. So I think he, it's weird how he makes, you know, everything is about him. And he even started one of those press conferences and it went like

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       how the economy's doing. So like, I think it's hard to view that dude morally as somebody that you're, I don't know that you would enjoy being around as a person. And then I get, I actually, I get what he was trying to do. I do to, with his, uh, uh, criticizing and tif and stuff like I, I, you know, I get it, but like it's the lack of savviness is even maybe more like in, in not knowing like this is a time where you do this and not that, that's also something you're like, wow. Like he just just feels like it's totally unfit for the job in my opinion, while I also feel like when you're, when you're the president, the workload must be impossible to imagine before you get in there and then once you get in there you're dealing with all these pressures, all these super important decisions and all these different areas and then some new shit comes up.

Speaker 4:          02:17:26       I've, I really think, and I'm not even seeing this as a critical of like I don't like him. I really think he is the only a few other people can experience this is truly like, Holy Shit with what this job entails. I think so too. I think it's really like one of those things where he's like, wow. And you can see that he's constantly. Like he always refers to the campaign still always in any conversation we'll talk about like I beat those guys because I think that's the part that he enjoyed. He enjoyed the competition days of the campaign and I think like, and then you know, he's always bringing up like the new. But the dad was setting records for for months and months and months, but like he'll still tweets will be about that or interviews will be about that. He can't not make a conversation, a statement with talking to.

Speaker 4:          02:18:12       It probably is a connection though between the Dow, the up and him being an office and people thinking that he's friendly to business to business markets. Love it. There's definitely no doubt about that. But there's also no doubt that unemployment was at record lows and setting records beforehand and the Dow has been breaking. Has been on an upswing for years now. Isn't that how it always is? Like presidents always come in and take advantage of the upward. There's, of course he's not the first highly predictive bucket that the economy does come in. These ebbs and flows. It does come in, abs and flows in the market. Inevitably, at least in in the history of it always comes back, always comes back. You know, if you. Even if you stayed through like black Monday, if you. The market's still eventually comes back. I'm too stupid to understand that I'm too stupid to get the market.

Speaker 4:          02:18:58       You know you're not. No, no, no. I mean I am in the sense that I'm not really interested in pursuing those lines of thought. I get that. That's different. My brain is just like, yeah, that seems like a pot of shit to me. I gotta get Outta here. If I tell you I to believe this, I don't know if it happened. Market Street from white supremacists. Somebody showed up. Oh, I don't pay attention to disconnect with myself. I don't watch world my whole life. I tell you what happened. Let me tell you what happens is through photo

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       shoots, they finished goods is that spray that makes everybody gay that they put on frogs. They're now using at j. crew like you know, like Abercrombie and Fitch does as you walk in and they hit you with that. That gay frog spray you. What I'm talking about, it makes you guys. So a bunch of dudes got crazy tattooed swastikas on themselves, took their shirts off. They're all walking around with citronella candles that they got from like a hardware store. That was the stupidest part of it all they had, they had like torches out. They're walking on the street with like, come on, you guys are walking around with lawn torches, pussies. They didn't even make the Frankenstein one where you get the fucking blame, the fucking gas run and chase to go fucking mosquito repellency shit. Listen dog. I tell you what this is. You know what man?

Speaker 1:          02:20:17       I have so many things on my plate. I had to stop watching. Tell you something else. I, I had to sit in my wife down like a man and tell about csm. BC was not allowed of the house no more. My wife is very political and I had to cut her off like I can't have too much drama. It's overwhelming. I can't have the tools to the table, you know, we would go out to dinner and somebody would bring something up and I had to kick her under the table and I feel bad. Let's not talk about that shit. Yeah. There's no reason. You know, how you hear that expression more than, you know, as a kid where people were like never bring up politics or religion, religion. Right. And as a kid you're like, I don't understand why that, but this is, I feel like the age where it becomes the most clear and, and at, at the time where you're like, oh, I told we can actually probably have a good time if no one talks about these things.

Speaker 1:          02:21:05       And it always comes up guys. You can't see for people talk for five minutes about anything without somebody bringing something up political. And you know what? At the end of the week, dog, you still gotta get up and go to work. You still gotta get up her groceries. She still gotta wipe your ass. All of this knowledge and gops and slds. I grew up in Hudson county, New Jersey, which comes into the Cook County, Illinois. Yeah. So I learned about politics and a micro. What's a smaller one? Micro. And it's a horrible thing. I benefited from it. I had no show jobs. I had to rip down, show jobs. I had a no show job at harvest med school when I was a kid going there once a week and pick up a check and laugh at the old Japanese. I didn't. I never moved the desk, no Karma and got me the job, got arrested.

Speaker 1:          02:21:52       So. But it's a, I saw the level. It never interested me. Like I was like, these people fucking pukes they're fucking puke. Zoot suits on. You know, before you guys were talking about taxpayer pay money, I want to see the agenda for the 12 fucking idiots that sit there with suits to the old and white and they sit there and 12 hours to make a decision. That's where our money goes. Yeah. You know, you don't know about bureaucracy till my mother died. That's where I learned about bureaucracy to 4:15. That's why I don't like it because my mother died. I couldn't even collect social security without coming up with 92 sheets of paper. That's a fucking social security number. That's a fucking name. And that's when she died. And that's an exit ticket. Give me my fucking money. Oh No. Oh No. It's another letter.

Speaker 1:          02:22:42       And another meeting, and you paid your taxes, you paid for this. This is your fucking harder than money. That's when you learn that it's all bullshit. And this is all bullshit. We are taxed in four years. Your kids are gonna. Come through and go daddy or your daughter's gonna come to you and go, I want to play basketball. You take them down there. If they charge you 85 to sign up dirty too for the shirt, which really is worth fucking $8 on a fucking in the black market. And then you gotta pay the sneakers, which are $100. When I was a kid though, Texas willow, I went to union city. I told him I want to play basketball. They put you on a team, they give you a shirt and you played every week for free. It didn't cost you anything. Look at the fucking. I don't even know about taxes or anything Joe.

Speaker 1:          02:23:33       All I know about is when I go buy a plane ticket and I look at those prices and I go, what about the family or to that isn't doing that well? Yeah. What about the fucking, if I was, if I was really a tax or have felonies, I can't vote so I don't even let that thing on my mind. What about the $50 I got to pay for parking when I go to a UFC event? Yeah. What about the $184 for a fucking lake? A ticket with a $100 for a fucking baseball ticket. When does it end? That's what I'm concerned about. I don't give a fuck about anything else. I want them to bomb fucking isis now today. But everything else for me applies to the American family that the American family does not stand a chance in this country no more. If your wife works and you have to pay date care, what are you bringing home?

Speaker 1:          02:24:22       What are you clearing after daycare? Right. Somebody was telling me for summer camp in studio city, it's $200 a week. That's $800 a month for the average person. What's the average person making this fucking country? Joe Rogan. So your taxes are getting used for shit. I taxes are getting used for shit shit because they're not going to where they're supposed to go $800 a month. It's like, what is that? Like 900 $9,600 a year. So a lot of money, but for fucking and the girl was telling me that her son has to volunteer and help other kids to get that rate city and I just was telling them, kindergarten at monarch is 30, $34,000. What is in the valley and you know, don't even mind. The other two were the daughter went to school. I'm like, ah, oh. And by the way, we're talking about all this. Like it's a big deal. If we were living in Manhattan, there'll

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       be a goddamn bark. Was a bargain bargain. That's what I. What I think about politics, I think about people who are fucking struggling that have two children and they can't go to a dodger game with a fucking baseball games you go to. As a kid. I can't tell you how many I went to as a kid. Yeah. But with these families cannot afford a dodger game, bro. I'm a fucking savage. My uncle loves baseball. He's on old man. I would go to costco and for $50 I get two tickets to hotdogs to sodas and a parking spot. I don't care about the fucking game. I take can be 74. Once magic took over the dodgers, they don't give you that deal no more. You don't want. It seems like. It's like if you have a giant population like we do in La and a something like a dodger take care of someone, even though it's a giant number of people, it's still a small percentage of this huge population.

Speaker 2:          02:26:14       I guess they just realize anybody does this, realizes he just jack it up higher. You're going to get a smaller percentage people, but there's still enough people, right? Exactly. Like why would we do that? Let's do that. Let's just make more and then if you. You know how it is when you go to a theater or something like that, it's got to be twice that. If there's some sort of a baseball game or something like that or one of those huge stadiums, they about all the people that have to get paid. All the people that are working there while you're working. They're like giant staff of humans that have to keep that thing running smooth. Yeah. What about the American family that flies a water? It's $4 and fifty cents for bottled water recharging. I thought water was free. They give you a cup of water, a cup of water.

Speaker 2:          02:26:55       What if and then when you go through Tsa, you can't bring the water through. You can't, but you can. You can buy water on the other side of the sun. If Joe Rogan you just barely getting by and you have three fucking kids and it's $3 a fucking water. I mean that's the shit that has always concerned me. I can break small guy. The fucking guy that wants to take the guy that works, he's divorced. He pays child support. He wants to take his kid to a dodger game and for him to get a ticket, he's got to sit with gang bangers and wear a helmet and a fucking nodding God fucking suit and you know, you can smoke pot and I just stayed really. There's a little section, supposedly the, you walk to the left and people's parking over there. Is that through? Let's just pretend that it make it happen.

Speaker 2:          02:27:39       Just do it, man. If anybody would let it go. It's La, right? Yeah. He's got more tolerance for weeds and La is. Did you see that video? I don't know where the fuck it happened. I think it was on the instagram feed. Clowning the homie. I don't know if you know that one. They always have some fun stuff up there, but there's a big giant white guy was a black cop. Beats the fuck out of them. Tasers them pizza. Fuck out of him with a club. And then uh, eventually they tasered him from behind. Another guy got him and he fell and banged his head off the ground. And the whole time the guy was saying like, I am not fighting you, I'm not fighting you. And they're just beating on him with this fucking that job. And I've said it a million times is not for everybody.

Speaker 2:          02:28:19       And it's one of the most difficult jobs in the world. Being a cop. Yup. Yeah. And what we're seeing, we're seeing that guy that shot that woman in the alley, this guy getting beat up by this metal pipe. Baltimore cops planting evidence, plant drugs. How long have you known me Joe Rogan? Twenty years. I did time. Now they use a verb. Ever, ever, ever heard me say some crazy shit. Crazy shit. But you've never heard me say the word pig. No, I have the most respect for police officers. It's a small percentage of people. A stressful job, but something's going on now. It's not just stressful. What about two days ago, the minutes with the gun to the black couple, while he was getting his license and they kept saying, please put the gun away and the guy held the gun. There is shit. This is. And then I love when if they shoot a black person, they just get like the black da that go up there and say, well we looked at this year, be up that black metallic cat downtown, eight cops to beat up a black retard.

Speaker 2:          02:29:17       And then the fucking kid died. And they said it's a fucking black kids fault. He's fucking retarded. Eight cops on top of him beating them. But this goes on constantly and you know what's going to happen and you fucking know what's going to happen. You know exactly what's going to fucking happen. Two or three years from now, all it takes is three angry black guys, three angry black guys with a surplus to spread the word. It was done with the Black Panthers. It was dunphy is three angry back like black guys. And they're going to fucking start going around in the cities and saying there's a fire. And with all these cops show up, they're going to be on Ruby's. And they gotta open up on them. This is going to happen in American cities. Some reading happened after Dallas, Dallas, that was so don't fucking tell me this is going to happen.

Speaker 2:          02:30:02       Three black guys that went through the service that got weapons, like I told you, unless you're retarded, you can't get weapons to that. I get, I get you. Whatever the fuck you want and something. I get you something in an hour, an hour, I'll get you something to go fight. I believe you, so nevermind. Assault rifles and shit like that. That's all you need is five assault rifles and say that a woman is getting raped at the end of the fucking a Cherokee Street and wait for 20 cops to come and open up on them. Dogs all headshots, headshots and leg shots. That's going to happen eventually because this cannot continue. This cannot continue. I think most people that become cops have a very difficult time doing it. I think for some people it's unmanageable and I think if you think about all the interactions and all the police officers have with all the people all day long, all across the country, the vast majority of it is inconsequential. It's people, traffic violations, little things here and there, but there's going to be a percentage. What is that percentage? Is it even one percent? I don't know what it is, but if that one percent gets online, we focused on that one percent, so whether it's that guy planting drugs in Baltimore or these guys beating up this giant white guy was giant, but he wasn't threatening them in any way. Just didn't want these guys like fucking danger in them and I think there's just way

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       too few people that are capable of navigating the waters, the waters of that kind of job. I think that kind of job is almost. It's almost as bad or as difficult rather as a being in the military. Your life is on the line. You're at risk all the time. Constantly. You know when people will call you a cop apologists, if you look at it like that. Listen man, if this shit goes down, someone's breaking into your house, you're calling the cops, man. Okay. That's what they're here for. And to pretend that you don't need them as well. Okay. Maybe someday we will, but right now you need cops for sure, and definitely they need each other. They need cops to and they know it and they and they see it more than you do because they're the ones who respond to murderers and armed robberies and rapes.

Speaker 3:          02:32:05       They're the ones who have to show up and handle car accidents on the highway with. I mean how much special training do they have that they get to deal with bodies that are torn apart for how much special training? No, I know. I'm not sure. I'm not sure you could even adequately train a person. Some people can handle it, period, but there's some people they see some dark shit and they just don't recover and then you ask those people to just keep pulling people over and I also think that they should train the cops a little more. I see a lot. I don't think they have the money. I say I agree with you. I agree with you. I see a lot of dumb shit in La Times. You're on Hollywood boulevard, bumper to bumper, and you go to see what it is and it's a fucking cop double park.

Speaker 3:          02:32:45       Given a homeless guy a hard time pull the carpet. You pull the car with you fucking scumbag. Can't you tell at 4:00 when this fucking traffic? They don't care. They don't give a fuck. You know what? One day I yelled from the car and they looked at me. I yell, really? Guys, eight in the morning, double fucking parked. Really no fucking genius here. And there's smoke coming out of his mouth while he's screaming, I'll fucking kill you. You think I'm fucking kidding me? I say Shit, because it's true. Come on. It's common sense. Yeah, of course. You want to give me a ticket when we go to court, we'll talk about and now we all got phones now. We all gotta fucking phones and videos and the whole fuck. That's who it's very dangerous. Is these laws against people filming cops were. They're doing shit like you can't have that.

Speaker 3:          02:33:27       No. Is that really a lot of them? Yes it is. There are several places where it is illegal to film cops while they're doing things. Find, make federally. It's not know for sure. The police have tried to tell people it's not, but I'm pretty sure my spreading fake news. I know that they can. Let's find out if that's the case. Um, are there places where it's illegal to film the cops and know they can tell you? Like if there's a situation going down, I felt like I was lying when I said that, that you can, they can tell you that they need a certain, like a bit of space, but I don't think they can tell you to stop filming. Hmm. That's interesting. I tried to go to Vegas and there was all vacation and there were these fucking smart kids and the cops kept telling them they had to get off and they would take, they would shoot him the cops and telling them that it was there.

Speaker 3:          02:34:16       Right. Here we go. Taking photographs and videos of things that are plainly visible and public spaces as a constitutional right. And that includes police and other government officials carrying out their duties. However, there is a widespread and continuing pattern of law enforcement officers ordering people to stop taking photographs or video in public places and harassing, detaining and arresting those who fail to comply the right of citizens to record the police as a critical check and balance. It creates an independent record of what took place in, in a particular incident. Okay. Well that. That's. So that seems like maybe what I was reading was about people that got arrested for it. So the cops were arresting him for but he doesn't even though it's not really illegal and they can still arrest you for a lot of things, then you go to court and you figure out the arrest and so if a cop arrest you for not listening to him.

Speaker 3:          02:35:03       So like if you're. If, if say save a cop is arresting someone and you're filming it because he's kicking this guy's ass and you start filming it and the cop says if you do not put that camera down, I will arrest you and they can still arrest you. They could say you're obstructing justice or I would say not to turn the camera with who's doing something wrong. Well, so I got you there. Right. It's like fucking hard to stay on the right path and not go straight dirty Harry. If some guy's trying to kill you and you're, you're, you know, you're involved in some situation and then you see people filming it too. Fuck man. I wouldn't want to navigate any of the shit that cops have to go through on a daily basis, but they also have

Speaker 1:          02:35:41       to clean it up a little bit and when they do something wrong and we watch it on film, they can't tell us that the cop was justified to do something. Of course. Suddenly there was a lot of shit going on that. I mean there was 37 murders in Chicago last weekend. What did that fuck? Somebody shooting murder or something crazy like in those places. A high level. But there's a lot of times I've seen cops act a little too much for what the situation. Cause where I grew up in Jersey were cops come in and they talked to you. They asked you, they separate you and they determine if this was even worth the fucking angle. These guys today, they'll come in, even if we do something at the store, they'll come into the store and investigate them for what you do. Go fucking chase, chase bank robber.

Speaker 1:          02:36:33       The day after nine slash 11, I pulled into fucking seven slash 11 and a guy had pulled over the line. Okay. You know, was called pulled over the line. So my car was over the line. The guy next to me and the whole cars I pulled in, I was six inches over a handicap thing on the Blue Line, cut and made au turn and came and gave me a $458. I understood I was wrong, but when we just blow up the World Trade Center. Yeah. You ain't got nothing better to do. You ain't got nothing better to do. You know, I see fucking Kinky shit all the fucking time if I'm not involved with it. So it's got nothing to do with me

Speaker 3:          02:37:12       copses there's a statistic number that they have to reach, right? Like if they believed that certain amount of traffic violations taking place in la, there's a strong influence on those guys to write a certain amount of tickets, whether you'd call it a quota anymore because I think those things are shawn. They say they don't have a quota, but they have something. They're out there. There's some severe incentive and if you don't meet the numbers that they expect and they in some way shape or form. Thank you. Are Not addressing some of the crimes that are being committed out there. I'm sure you get a hard time for it.

Speaker 1:          02:37:48       Listen brother, when I got arrested in [inaudible] 87, that detective, that fucking moron from bolden, who I liked, you know, he got me for four years and he thought he was fucking what? You know, like when, like when they, when they locked up, Godaddy, the Teflon Don, he loved you by. You could have gotten me for 22 years if you've done your homework. If that couple is just a little bit, he would have done 22 years. You don't know how many times I sat next to him at the preliminary hearing and I'm like, hold this dude doing rug reminds me, Oh, you don't like him? Because he had come to talk to me about something else, the same fucking cop a year earlier, put it together and that would have got me more in the kidnapping, so every time I saw this cop I would sit there at the end.

Speaker 1:          02:38:36       I would just call them like a big dope because he was six foot four with the big chest, with the bulletproof. Your thumbing around like you fucking know it. You're talking to me. It's like that fucking kid. A couple of weeks ago that pushed that fucking little Mexican hot dog cart. You'll never hear from him again. Who? That little Argentenians dude that pushed that little Mexican dude with the fruit cart when talking about. We're talking about see that Jesus Christ, Joe Rogan, watch lions attacking a monkey, but you haven't seen somebody that way a couple of weeks ago with some poor little Mexican dude was selling hotdogs on the corner and some fucking little. He thought he was one of those dudes with the skinny jeans, with a guns and roses shirt. Him and his fat, white, ugly fucking girlfriend went up to the dude and told them to move. You never saw this. They told him to move man harassing a food vendor flipping over. Oh my God. Joe Rogan. Huh? Look at this fucking jerk off looking with a dog. You can tell he's a fucking punch him.

Speaker 7:          02:39:41       What happened? Watch. He told him to move a little speck kid. Turns out his camera.

Speaker 1:          02:39:57       Do you want to move it? Why? Because he's fucking he. Well, he's a skinny Jean guy with that dirty, filthy white animal. Have a girlfriend. So he wants to be a tough guy. Was Fidel Watch what happens though.

Speaker 2:          02:40:19       Mexicans through that red pepper right his fucking face. And I didn't mind it. Look, this is what we're calling the police. That dude had a pickup and move. Let me tell you what those colors. You see those carts with the umbrellas. How would you noticed a lot more of those carts that have the rainbow umbrella? Thompson, the girl. I've seen a few. You know why? No, that the cartel really remember years ago when you first moved to La, that was star maps. What's going on here at the rest of it? Jamie got it. Takes off his shirt. Did they get in a fight after this? No, he fucking threw the pepper riders face the fucking hot pepper. Tremendous. He just took his shirt off. Yeah. She because he threw pepper in his face. A little funny. Still hanging out like right there. It's weird because they thought the cops are going to come.

Speaker 2:          02:41:07       People came to help this little Mexican dude, but that dude had to leave town with this fat fucking disgusting filthy girlfriend hygiene because you don't run into those things. The cartel. That's why you see so many more voices. He didn't like it. They just didn't want them there because it's like silver lake and he's special. He's a white dude with the skinny jeans. Baggy fucking thugged out, be it. You know what? I've known this man. There's a lot of people that think that it's okay to be aggressive because they're in the right, but didn't you say during the right dog dog, dog, ain't nothing going to go down. That's a pussy. That dude was a pussy. That poor kid. Let me tell you something. The cocktail brings the coke cup and fruit. They chop up the fruit. Then they sell the fruit. They don't make.

Speaker 2:          02:41:54       They don't make a loss. They have these new umbrellas everywhere and they have them even across the street from each other. They don't sell drugs. That's what they make the cash drop offs. I've had people see him all the way from San Diego all the way to fucking receive it. They're all on the main strips and they were all confused. That's why they were around. She said, Da, don't catch them. They don't drop off drugs. They just drop off an envelope with a number on it. Number eight, 52. That's where Joe Rogan's number and then some guy comes that day and it picks up all the envelopes and it goes right to instant either and that's the end of the day. When we first got here, we started maps.

Speaker 2:          02:42:30       That turned out to be a Spanish prostitution ring. Wasn't really fucked. They will fucking those little Mexican kids up there as they jumped the wall, the stretch the muffler out white Duke and fucking Hollywood boulevard. I got to pee. I'm trying to hold the center. You didn't know that. I know that. That star maps even made a movie about it. What tall star maps really went out there with the title? What's the weight? They made a movie about it. Yeah, and this was what you could a bro. Look at the tagline down there. If you can read it time. Carlos wants

Speaker 4:          02:43:12       to be an actor, but his father, pepper one sent me to work in the family business. That is male prostitution. Carlos decides that he will be one of his fathers boys until he can. What in the fuck, man? Star maps. I had no idea. Nineteen 97. That's great. That's so nuts. No idea. And that's for people that don't know, that's the people that they sold map to celebrity homes. Right. That was the whole idea of a sunset when you, when I first got here in [inaudible] 98, that was a thousand of those moocs on sunset. Fucking uh, uh, you know. Yeah. Yeah. And Hollywood and uh, they're still out there. They still are, but just less heroin is involved with that. Well, not, I don't see the star. I see the star vans don't see the star maps. I don't see the so much better. I was holding that one crazy man. Bitch. Fucking craziness. It goes fast. Great things we're do with our lives. You know what I'm saying? What are you going to do with our lives? That's the thing. Where does it all go? Man? Thousand podcasts now was exchanged. Fucking a society. You fucking stop.

Speaker 3:          02:44:30       Changed. Changed us for sure. It's a tapping. All the people thing. All the people you've had on the conversations you've had with those people, you know, how much of that would you ever have if it wasn't for doing your podcast? No, it changes you. It changes the way you think of things. It changes me for sure. It changed a lot of the way I think if things are getting a chance to sit down with people for hours and hours uninterrupted, no phone calls, no messages, no text messages, and to be able to do that on a regular basis, you get to know people and like a way different way. We don't really get a chance to do that with each other that often to sit down and just have no distractions. Just you and a friend having a conversation, laughing, talking shit about things or the cool thing is that's the experience.

Speaker 3:          02:45:16       People are getting listening to it. That's why you know how much time, how many times have we been on the road and we went to a diner afterwards and we were laughing literally until we in tears falling down like we were doing podcasts. It was just nobody listening to lecture. Crying and laughing was like the three of us and some fucking strange. Nashville, it's. I understand. Totally is what happened today. It's the same thing. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. No, it's so cool to replicate it left in that joint over there. Yeah, that's definitely more for open those reefer madness. I brought another shout out to la speed. We'd Gina. Gina was keeping us keeping it strong. I don't know what they got to do though. They got to be careful with these fucking things. They give these

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       suspended at an actual glass thing that the weed comes in and breaks in your pocket. Oh, that's no good. That's not good. This one is superior slick. When you go to a bathroom at a hotel like a fine. So they give you glasses in there. There's two glasses by the sink. Like what the fuck? Those pretentious we'd guys. Yeah. Oh Man. Well it's clearly an indycar. Probably the south Americans trained like a micro dose. The other side. It might be BC in my PBC. Yeah, sorry. I'm pretty sure. Pretty sure. It's like maybe, maybe Seattle, maybe Seattle. Northwest, northwest. It's like basically the good stuff. Joe. We motherfucking Dee Wade adrenaline. Wow. Podcast. I forgot there's a show tonight.

Speaker 2:          02:47:04       We're going to forget a lot of shit along the way too. I feel like it's St and pma. We talked about some shit earlier. That was the funniest shit ever said in my life, but if anybody asks me like, how is the podcast that I go, oh dude, Joey Diaz went on a rant. It was the funniest fucking thing I ever heard in my life. Then he'd go, what is it about ago? Couldn't tell, couldn't tell. I also couldn't tell you what the last thing we talked about this or that. Whatever it is. I don't know what it is. It's not that important. It's not that important, but these things change us, man. I know your, your podcast, changing new job, you know, it's, it's connecting you with a most people that like to come out, see you in a way that nothing else has ever had before, you know?

Speaker 2:          02:47:46       No. The biggest thing about the podcast is keeps me in check, keeps Punjab substance check. We got to stick to what we say. Yeah. We got to preach what we talk about, you know, acute system check, man. There's no more. Uh, we got somebody watching this now that you know, so it's pretty fun. And interesting to me, it does keep in check, but it also, it's, it's, um, ultimately satisfying to, you know, to just stay in check, you know, to like think about what you're doing and say, say, say things that are as accurate as you possibly know, be honest about how, you know, how you're thinking about these things. Like where are you drawing your conclusions from? Totally. People don't have a chance to do that that often. They don't have to be accountable for their own thoughts, you know, not, not to the level of like someone who, uh, is a hosting a podcast or someone who's constantly being reviewed by people you know, like people do hold you accountable to do.

Speaker 2:          02:48:39       They do. And that's what I like about it. They showed if I get to do a periscope in the morning and I tell people I'm gonna, go to Jujitsu today, I get 20 tweets. Sedna was it? What did you learn that I didn't go because Ah, you fucking pussy to you guys. Listen Bro. Let me tell you some good back told. My mother stopped drinking. She stopped drinking in 11 days later. She was dead. That's why I believe you always got to have a shot at something. You know what I'm saying? I'm not talking about drinking a bottle at night. I'm not a big believer in anecdotal evidence unless it benefits me. So in that case I'll go with one to two notes. Ain't going to kill nobody. You were saying Dr. say do this circle. Let me. I was so much fun to you. James. James. Motherfucker. You good sir?

Speaker 2:          02:49:34       When you drink these things. Like I said, it's nothing. I love the white dudes. I love white people. Do you like. I don't like these like nice white people they dragged me with. But what about Charlottesville? Kinda crazy white people. But like where do you draw the line? I like white people who bring a bottle of Bourbon, but the most important thing is they bring a bag of ice because then when you fucking with that ice, when a white dude shows up with a bad guys, that's a man of class stylists. Don't put it in the freezer and leave it right there. That means they dropped one ice cube in there every 20 minutes and they got a time. That's the whole thing. Just fuck fucking ice. Yeah, I totally agree. Man. Dude's house and he's gonna. Walk in human door. Filled with cigars. Do you go, Huh?

Speaker 2:          02:50:21       Yeah. Malone the fuck. Are you doing man? What are you doing with your time? You got a walking human door. I feel like age is matches up with cigars in a way that few things do. Like an old dude with a cigar is like, I want to hang out with him. I wouldn't have a drink. I want to hear what he has to say. Yeah. Like a 22 year old with cigar. I'm like, get the fuck Outta here. You feel like you can't have a leather vest and you're like, fuck tee shirt with a leather vest. You don't smoke smoking. You don't look cool. Smoking the cigar. Tony Soprano. Go turn it over. You're like, I need to fucking cigar. You know why? I Bet James Gandolfini really enjoyed smoking a cigar. He's like actually enjoying the cigar while he's acting like he's enjoying. Enjoys the it. He was a bad motherfucker.

Speaker 2:          02:51:09       Hell, you want me to tell you something? That's the first guy I could say like doing. A couple of weeks ago, I went back to my hotel room, the fucking original getaway with Steve McQueen and I forgot, Bro. I felt, God, you forget your roller. Look, I get tears in my eyes. He's in the dumpster with that bitch. After the thing, tripped them over and she's fucking town them on. He's like, well, we should just break waves. And she's like, well obviously you can't get over me having sex with somebody else or you're a mental midget. And Steve Mcqueen, Bro. He just grabbed me by the hand and then he goes back to the whole. He shoots all those fucking rednecks. Oh, we forget how bad. Steve McQueen. We'll look at him. Look at this fucking look at this fucking man of a man that he was my man so lot. So from the Godfather. Watch Steve McQueen with a fucking suit on. This is 1973 dog.

Speaker 2:          02:52:09       He's so smooth. This is not the scene you got to put on the scene is when he beats up. Allie mcgraw and she thought it was acting and he just lived. He pretty much smack the shit outta her. She didn't know, but he would smack the shit out of every other day for some reason or another. He was like her up. Yeah. Seen Bro. He just had funny, funny thing. I'll probably wear it with your listing. I don't believe in violence towards women, but if I wasn't married to Yoko Ono, you know you gotta kick her once a day, somewhere in the back and the stomach. Shut the fuck up sheet. Look how beautiful this woman was. Number one, look at the natural beauty of this fucking woman and look at this blonde savage of a man. Look at him. He's fucking. Steve McQueen gets out of the car and he just starts walking in front of the car. Does he smack her after this? He was little. He had beautiful look at him with his black suit on and he's furious. Fight hair. I wear my hair like that. Yes. I will make my head start. Okay. Crazy glue. I figured out, but you don't want to lose you and put crazy glue in the morning. They won't go nowhere. Now she's getting out of the car. She looks upset.

Speaker 2:          02:53:28       It was pretty emotional. Yeah. Look at this year, this 72. I was not and I went to see this the first weekend. My mother goes, what'd you go see? Steve McQueen. Are you fucking crazy? Wow. Oh Jesus Christ.

Burt rentals in the beginning when he grabs her by the throat and hits her with a bottle of something. This Berg Grant, we watched it here, but this, this is fucked up because it's crazy that you, you know, he's really hitting her a few times. He told her. It's like when Sean Penn did at close range with with whatever and he kept shooting a gun and finally Sean Pengos Gimme the gun because you're not reacting to the right way. You're not being scared. So he shot a real gun at Christopher Walken, Christopher Walken, and talks about it all the time. Look at this fucking savage. Go knows the movie. Opens this shit. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

Didn't even give her a cushion man. Like, look at what's going on. Yeah. There was an actress. Would you let burt reynolds throw you to the ground? No. Fuck No. No. That year dude. Getting thrown to the hurts that she had hurts. Like she just ricocheted off the ground. One hundred percent. That wasn't a stockperson often. This stuff.

As soon as that, he gets in his class and that's what's on the right. Here we go. A Burt Reynolds v eight. Oh yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:58:02       yeah. Black box. That's a Maserati. Levante. It's. Oh, that's hilarious. Wo The cops. She called the cops. Whoa. That car is so fast. Oh my God. Meanwhile, that car handles like total dog shit. What is it? I don't know, but I mean those cars back then. Even the best ones handled like shit. That thing as skinny tires. A fucking caveman suspension.

Speaker 3:          02:58:53       Well, it probably did drive a lot better than those police cars. Police cars were like the worst cars you could drive. Your trying to catch somebody. They have four doors. You want a car that has two doors. That's true. Sports car. It's got a good balance and something go wrong corners quick with you don't like race. Cars aren't big long. Four doors. That's a lot of extra weight. It's nuts. Yeah. Having a like a police car, but today they have police cars today. They're like, they can make like mustangs. They turn them into a police car charger. Yeah. Dude, there's some scary cars today when it comes to like a a car pulling you over. Like if the cops have that new dodge demon. Have you seen that thing that's fucking nuts. 800 horsepower. Zero to 60 in like two seconds. Really fucking crazy.

Speaker 3:          02:59:45       Like they can love it. They make sure it doesn't work. If it's colder than 15 degrees out Dubai has the world's fastest police car, have a Bugatti. Oh my God. Two Pie ball in the fall and so strong, so strong. I mean if you disrespect bond, you forget about cultural differences. You got to respect their ball. Oh, divide does it up if you. If you do it up even a little bit. I don't give a fuck. Stop. Stop making excuses. They ball harder than anybody. Yeah. They have an indoor ski place that you could have in the desert. Did He. Was there a fight there? No, but there was a fight in Abu Dhabi and we did the weigh ins and Dubai. That's cool. It was weird, man. There's so much money there that was interested in against Damien Maia. Yeah. And Frankie Edgar versus Bj Penn to like, I'm pretty sure that we're there to really have crazy, crazy money. I think it's off the charts, you know, I think. I don't think we even understand oil money. You know, what we make. We think we're doing good these guys, and it's like many generations of having that kind of cash. It's a different level of cash now. The family wealth, it gets passed down. That's where the news is. Old white money ain't no ganglion that

Speaker 4:          03:01:00       Jack. They have interior a surf places too. We can go surfing. It's nuts man. You run a surf board and is that where the government will give citizens money that just want to do anything? Really? Yeah. Yeah. My Dubai, I thought so maybe I have it wrong, but my cousin came here to study English like from Peru, so he had a class with a bunch of people from different countries. I thought he said this classmate from Dubai will be like, everybody want to go out on Saturday, like it's all good and would pick people up and like limo buses and he's like wait, who's paying for this? And he's like, oh I got it. It ain't shit. And then was telling them like, he was like, how we you're just going to pave this? He's like, look, it's just given to me man. I got to spend all this shit.

Speaker 4:          03:01:44       I don't even know what the disease is current. Just buying everybody drinks, food, going to vegas like 15 people. He just in class with. Yeah. Nobody balls harder than them. Yeah. It's pretty out of control everywhere he goes. Ferrari's, bentleys, lamborghinis. There's like ridiculous. There's cars that I feel like it would be ridiculous to show up on one of those boundaries that they have or one of those bugattis rather that they have as a police car for sure. Since sandy now like two and a half million bucks so much. I think floyd mayweather has like six.

Speaker 4:          03:02:17       He's hilarious. His habits are hilarious. I love him. He's got like a whole list in white. White is right. I got a bunch of two though. Man. Does gang or cars? All the money to the irs. Why don't you just give him. Because he went so deep so much. Does he? Oh, well. Uh, it's more than you want to pay. It's in the 20 plus million dollar range. It's a lot of money, man. But it's not something that he's been a. it's not like deception. No. It's just neglect to neglect and it's also like, I think there is truth to this. He makes so much money, there's probably a point where they're like, hey, it's time to pay your taxes. And you go like, all right, here's a check for $25 million dollars. That's an incredible amount of money. And then they go, that's true, but you owe 50 more.

Speaker 4:          03:03:08       And he's just like, that's, that can't be right. I've got $25,000,000. Yeah. Like what are you talking about when he's bought over 100 luxury cars from the same dealer and always pays in cash is $15 million worth of cars. Congratulated. She doesn't drive. I like it. Good. You can sell those. They're worth a lot of money. He can get that money to, you know, it's um, it's just, it's, it's really interesting in the amount of money that he's able to generate, you know, he's figured out some pretty incredible shit. He's a great villain to man. He's just brilliant at it. Mean was just a brilliant defensive boxer. Oh, skill wise. Off the charts off the truck. I'm saying that guy should get more credit for what he does as a skilled businessman and psychological

Speaker 2:          03:03:58       warrior. Like he should get a lot more credit for it. Yeah, I think so too. I think it's arguable that, you know, he's enjoying it and he enjoys playing the villain role and enjoys like flashing on the money and if he is really enjoying it, like don't you love that and respect that. That fucking thing. What is that car? That thing looks amazing. What is it a CCS? Is that a con of Sig? Yeah, I'd say that cone. That's a word that I've never said a name, but I can't say it. I love too that he starts his post with the amount. Like to remind people that my new car. Yeah, my new four point $8,000,000 car. You say that Koenigsegg, Koenigsegg. Koenigsegg coincide coding, coding, coding, coding, Koenigsegg. Jesus Christ. Koenigsegg. Zec. That's a ridiculous name. Change your name, but the cars dope, you're saying?

Speaker 2:          03:04:55       I think so, yeah. Oh yeah. I'm in DC. Both of working during this fight. You were headed already recruit. I already booked way in advance. Now it's my dad's birthday. I'm going a big birthday celebration. You got to try to, uh, avoid finding out what happened and then watching. No, it depends, man. It, I haven't. I don't know. I'm going to gauge also his interest in it. You know, I always try to get home before I find out anything or watch it before I find out anything and I always fail to do so you'll always, I cannot give it, uh, give me any temptation. I know it's hard to go online. Let me check real quick. Am I worthwhile? Well, what if they tell me it's a five round decision, you know, title fight or this one's gonna be 12 rounds boxing and know it's going to be an exciting event.

Speaker 2:          03:05:40       It's one of those like you'll remember like the excitement to tune in. So I think we are going to want to watch it. You know, conor mcgregor is a magic person. Yeah. Like legitimately like to get this many people so hyped up about this fight. It's not just about his performances, his fights. It's also about like wanting to believe that there's a dude who can pull it all off. Yeah. It was like a magic person. Do you feel like in the lead up to the fight, like as we get closer, your opinion on it has changed at all? Oh yeah. I'm a sucker for a good hype job, dude. That's why I'm a good hype man. Yeah. I'm a sucker for believing all that stupid shit. I thought Gerry Cooney had a chance against Larry Holmes when I was in high school. I saw Gerry. Gerry Cooney knockout Ken Norton and was like, he might have a chance. I like, was it. Who was the other white dude that was the great white hope that I think for Larry Holmes and 82 and he wouldn't make eye contact. No, not Chavala. June of 82 82. Oh, Gelada. Galana. So you're talking about and you know. Yeah. Know Gerry Cooney is the guy that. Is that the guy you're thinking of? The Guy I was talking about, the guy that. Oh, okay. Yeah. That's Gerry Cooney. Yeah. That's the guy was talking about some white dude. Yeah. When I was in high school, I was

Speaker 4:          03:06:56       who? Who's the white dude from Bayonne? That fort. Oh, the Bale and bleeder weapon. Yeah. I guess he's the guy that they based the movie rocky on because they didn't expect him to survive and he kept surviving. You kept moving forward and Chuck Wepner was the guy. I think that was one of the inspirations for the movie rocky because that guy just kept plodding forward and Muhammad Ali beat the shit out of him, but I don't think he stopped them. Damn. Yeah, look at that crackers face man too. He got dropped there. I get that man. Muhammad Ali in his prime was so magic, man. What he could do as far as movement, his ability to like move in and out, slide around. A lot of people thought he was doomed when he was gonna Fight Sonny Liston, like there is no fucking way this kid is in so much trouble.

Speaker 4:          03:07:51       All he could do is like box around and move and move fast. But Sonny Liston is a murderer, murderous puncher, and he got like, he beat the fuck out of Floyd Patterson. So like the way he would beat those guys, you'd be like, oh Jesus, nobody can stand in front of him. Like very rumbled Johnson, you know, maybe even more so in his power. Yeah. It was like pitch that it's not taking place today. Spot, you know, it sucks. It sucks about not living through an era is you can never fully appreciate it. Totally much as you want to know. Like I already know I've had enough lessons about Ali, you know, but like you're like, Oh man, I really wish I would have lived through it. Like I already see it now. I became conscious of it now because of basketball because people are always always doing this Jordan or Lebron, you know, argument this hypothetical and like you go back and forth, but like you real is the first time I realized there's people arguing who, who weren't alive during that Jordan craziness.

Speaker 4:          03:08:49       And I'm like, Oh, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about right now. You have no idea what that was like. You can pull up any statistic you want. You have to, you don't. You don't feel that you didn't watch that dude become a fucking savage, like a God damn, you know, Spanish conquistador in fucking the NBA where you could not believe what a killer. He was like, you've never seen that level of competitiveness and how like how that dude could dominate. We've never seen, but there's people I realized they were like, oh no, I've seen highlights, and I'm like, no, you don't get it. Like you don't get how dominant he was. Jordan, Jordan, Jordan dominant. It was the craziest thing ever. The first time I saw Jordan fly from the foul line through the air and slam dunk a ball. I remember thinking, how. How does a person, how does a person even do that with our body? Yeah. Keith, he literally flew through the air and slam dunked this ball and I'm not exaggerating where it was. Basically

Speaker 2:          03:09:54       where the foul line was. He fucking went flying to the. An extra step job role. Bowling favor you put on the top 10 dogs by Julia survey. Just one second. Let's do that and then we'll go to Jordan. We'll break it down because before Lebron, that was Jordan for Jordan, there was a guy from long island and Julia. Sure, and he used to kill one team. The best dunks of all time with done by him against the Lakers. Here guys. This isn't. This isn't. This is a regular one. Okay. This is nothing. Okay, I'll look at that. This is a guest look. Watch this on one hand that that's just your job. That's super. Watch this. Boom and bad. Over seven foot four and he's six foot six. He is against. Look at this bad. Okay.

Speaker 2:          03:10:43       My favorite was Daryl Dawkins destroyed the Baptist Joe Rogan over a hooker rice or snorting coke with Darrell bock. Look at that from the top of the refrigerator. Put this back, but just run this back dog. He was. He was going to call my podcast, but he died three weeks later. Three weeks before it was a dream. I went to a psychic. No, no, no. He did. That's against bill wall. Look at this one, I guess. I guess that was a watch. This one is against this guy. Oh, watch these tool. That's beautiful. The elevation man, the problem is that's what everybody wants to say. You don't want to see all the shit leading up to the. It's like when I watched the whole. This was dramatic. Hurry up against the trump lexus. Look at him because he kept calling for a file. Look at him, Bill Walton.

Speaker 2:          03:11:36       All his shit. Look it up. Look up, bitch. You're going to be this, but I'm slamming right in your fucking face. He but one was called for a foul. He know what I feel like if you have a dishonorable claim at a foul. If you're doing something like those soccer players do sometimes, get this one. You should lose points. Look at this one, Joe Rogan. There's the one. I Bet I won. I had the sixes in Philly. I guess Michael Cooper is shit. Keep matching theme. They gave their hamburgers. I was down there looking at me. He was getting they. We're getting the point that game. Okay. Now go to 10 greatest Michael Jordan dunks about Mike Brown hair yourself for fucking avatar movie. Get on the toilet, getting hit the ball boy for the niche. Find out a lot about basketball players. First of all, do you know basketball players throw away their sneakers after every game? It's crazy that a lot of them do. So he would take the sneakers and sell them on the. On the. Before Ebay he would take the net sneakers and so look at this crazy shit man that looked like somebody press controls and then about he did that. He has some spectacular air time. Oh man, look at this.

Speaker 2:          03:12:52       He just flies in there man. I wonder what's like the record distance? Yeah. I know I said from the free throw line, but what's like the record distances someone's ever dunked from on top of the key is way crazier yonker though 18. It's 18. It's 15 from the free throw and it's 18 from the top of the key. Somebody Julia serving. Oh my. All the time. And the things that David Thompson, he's shaking his head Jamie say saying no. As far as anyone's done, the free throws, maybe $15. That's still insane. But now it's done like a foot or two behind it. But have you ever seen Vince Carter's dunks? No, because that dude is 40. Let's enjoy these first. Yeah, these are. Go to Vince Carter, but let's enjoy these for a moment because these are spectacular. I mean, Jordan was just another bar in it. It's a.

Speaker 2:          03:13:43       it's a beautiful thing because the planet Thompson would go, I'm watching 30 for 30 and I want to call Joe Rogan and call them because I know he's not that sport. Like the one about Detroit when they beat him up really bad ass. Yeah. He decided to lift weights. Trying to get on that maximum. This ain't ever gonna happen again. Look at the donkey was when he was done, but Joe Rogan. Oh yeah. He used to wait. Look at the way he held his hair because he went and got on. Really lifted against the Detroit Pistons, but Joe Rogan has a basketball enthusiast and I called Dama wherever. There's only one the greatest dunked the ball time and because he jumped over a motherfucker who did that. That's what I'm talking to Joe. You Got Mad ally Drexler Against Louisville. Nineteen 81, right? Right, right. Against the wizards or dunk and Houston was called five slamma Jamma because that's all they did was dunked. There's a few athletes that I feel like even from our era you could bring to today and there will be super successful. Like Marvin Hagler is one of them. I feel like I'm going to go get ready. Boom. No, that's not the ones are that.

Speaker 2:          03:15:04       That's not the one. No.

Speaker 2:          03:15:07       There's a few athletes that I think you could take today and they would be super successful. Like for short, Julia Surveying for sure. Michael Jordan for sure. For sure. Magic Johnson for sure. You know, no matter what, like you bring them into this era where there'll be successful in almost any area. I'll never forget I was at a ball. What Vince Carter did. I was at a bar one night and there was a Cuban dude and he was passed out like this. Joe Rogan. Can you find the video? Joey? Have the do the. He jumped over the dude. I've never seen it. It doesn't look, but look at this shit. What's this? This is Vince Carter.

Speaker 2:          03:15:48       Oh my God. It's amazing. He rubbed his nuts on that dude's head washed out again. Watch this. He rubbed his nuts on that detail. Tell. Yeah, it's incredible. He went over that do 10 just do to still dumps like this and he's 40. That's insane. That's an athlete. When we were in high school, he was in high school for a minute, close to us. I jumped over that guy. They would show his high school highlights on local news like it was. They would cover it like an NBA game. Dude, look, look, I know he's rubbing his tick on that guy's ear. Watch while you fucking my fucking is fucking face, right? He said mind fucking them directly through the ear and then slams that. That's insane. Yeah. No, Roy Jones Jr was like that. Oh yeah. Roy Jones Jr in his prime, had some athleticism that didn't even make sense.

Speaker 2:          03:16:36       He was able to land a lead left Hook instead of a jab or a lot of guys shot in a jab. Roy Jones Jr. He like most of the time, lead with a lead left hook. WHoa, jesus. I got to fly around the rim and dunk. That's the arman rim dunk. Ladies and gentlemen. It's much more difficult than the right. Think about a. You've got to worry about breaking your arm. Thompson had a 48 junk vertical way inch. I think about that. That was 30 years ago. I can't imagine the kind of vertical jumps. College player. I got to be up to 60 slash 55 inches. those defensive backs. michael irvin, michael, wherever we could jump four feet in the air. Yeah, that's how he became like a one one. He's afraid because the giants with the blonde hair back. I see him at jake waves. Just put.

Speaker 2:          03:17:28       Ain't no bigger than here though. A old though. Back then it was not that much bigger than jake. Glaser's got a hell of a gym. Huh? I saw stallone was working out there with chocolate dal's. Like what kind of chris you have? You go see that. Football players. Fighters all day long training. Um, what's it called again? A something optimum performance and breakable. Breakable. Yeah. The oWner is a man. Good move on his part. He wasn't back up from chicago. That's a, that's a smart move, you know, be a part of some sort of a cool strength. We don't look at that dog. This is a brand hand. Well, athletes are always getting better, right? If you go back to baseball from the 19 fifties and then go to baseball in 2017, it seems better and better. Athletes, you're seeing people that are Just faster, smarter, trained, better use, better nutrition.

Speaker 2:          03:18:22       They're optImizing themselves the best they can. The question is like, I wonder like genetically what's happening? I wonder if like people genetically are getting bigger and faster. I wonder if it's like a little slight uptick that will one day maybe 20 years from now, 30 years now registering in a big way because you've got to wonder with all these people competing in crossfit and all the strength and conditioning stuff, people's bodies might start literally thinking they have to work harder again. They have to get stronger and bigger. Again, people might get bigger. This is my terrible understanding of genetics as applied. I'm sold on it. Just on that alone. The public peer reviewed pApers did. I've spent the cub dog. I'm waiting, I know the thRee weeks I spit in the cup, just hit home related to. I did it. The mr. Com, do you see that thing about all those white racists were found out they were a black people in their past and then they credit the test for that reason.

Speaker 2:          03:19:22       You know who you can taLk shit about because if you find a certain percentage like I could talk shit about italians. Sure. Because I'm mostly italian. Yeah. You know, so most people wouldn't consider it a bad thing when you move. Silliness got raped by the noise and then the more and then the sicilians one night on the night of the vest was in 1600 got up and they cut the dick off and shoved them in their fucking mouth. That's why you can't talk about rape and for the most resIlient. Neither the vespers is an old sicilian tradition to go. That's why those sicilians or go with knives. Crazy. Now millions of go with knives. They tell you, keep them at arm's distance. Would olsher chileans don't fuck with them because they got those knives that go with those knives and shit. It's crazy. Cubans. My sister's dark skinned and then I look at my cousin who's my skin and his sister. The singer is dark skin show. I know there's some african shit in my fucking blood. It's Cuba. Who's um, what's the band's name? X alfonso. Aggie. Aggie band. the band or in excel? Phonto. Is that it? His name is becky and her name is emma. I've got it on my phone.

Speaker 2:          03:20:32       If you ever go to his cousin's cousin, amazing band. Really do. They're really, really good. But they the fuck the ria. So yeah, here iT is. X alfonso, back to my mail. Gimme some gimme some volume on this shit. They're really good dude. I mean no bullshit. Listen to this on my way to the comedy store all the time. I get pumped up because I don't know what the fuck they're saying. So just for me just feels good. It's like celebratory and I get into my own head thinking about my material. I get pumped up listening to this night. you sent me a video you were looking at, you were listening to something else like italian music. I always do that. Yeah. I always listened to language that I don't understand. So you don't think about the words? Yeah, I don't think about the words at all.

Speaker 2:          03:21:15       See, this doesn't. I don't understand what this is and there's. There's ignorance in it, but there's also a freedom. So freedom is that I can hear the beautiful sound of his voice and not have any context to it. No, no. Like whatever his messages or anything and I can have it in the background and 100 percent concentrated on what I'm trying to do and just enjoy it. And it's like an instrument. Yeah. Like if you like listening to a, a shooting star by bad company, you johnny was a schoolboy when they heard his first beatles' song. That's going to change the way you feel like you hear about that. If you're writing about a certain thing, you're not gonna be able to concentrate on your subject. I think it was from there. It didn't take him long and when I was in high school, everybody wanted to be that guy.

Speaker 2:          03:22:02       Everybody wanted to be that bright star that burnt out, didn't fade away, and everybody's like, man, we lost johnny. When he goes, I love when he goes, don'T you know, you know that you fucking tremendous. It's great fucking mail. Yeah, I'll look at his sister if you scroll down, show him my sister. So my whole family is like this with the male is light skin, but my sister is dark skin. I just said fuck it. I got it. And then some other kids sent me paperwork that I was related to some italian navy guy called Louis Diaz from ninth to from 1832. So I said, enough with this shit, let me just spit in a cup. Plus it also tells you where your genetics guy and what you might die of what you might get cancer have. You might have cardiovascular disease. It tells you what your family did a family reunion in 2000 and they hired this genealogy expert and they thought like this would be like the big culmination on saturday.

Speaker 2:          03:23:06       Who to present a family history that everybody in the family. It's like 30, 40 people there this weekend. No, no, no. This was in the year 2000. And then that guy started telling us about this, uh, our first guy that came over from Spain and then where he landed and like 17, 20. Everyone's like, oh, that's cool. And then he was just like, he was a real piece of shit and like he killed somebody and he went to, he went to prison and then he, he was stealing from people and when he died he left 60 slave to this person and everybody was like, well, let's go have dinner now. Yeah. Hey, we're baffled. Every baffles me because diaz is a cuban. Yeah. And then there's the diaz brothers that are mexican, right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So that means our relatives came from Spain spraying. we went to an island and the other one went through Mexico through somewhere.

Speaker 2:          03:24:02       And I look at those deals, brothers and like, well I got this guy. We're both with the of us retarded. There's got to be some type of blood that we shed because we're not all bad, you know what I'm saying? But there's also a d as in puerto rico. Right? And that's a different kind of ds. Then the mexIcan ds to, you know, it's, it's, you know, it's really interesting once you hear enough spanish and you hear the difference between like being friends with you and listening to a lot of cuban people talk like cuban people have like a very certain rhythm and then puerto ricans have like a different kind of rhythm and mexicans have their own rhythm. All differenT changes. Man. the funny thing about hanging out with thomas, people look it up and he looks like a brosky from like Wisconsin or something. They don't

Speaker 1:          03:24:44       realize he speaks fluent spanish. So people will talk shit in spanish in front of you all the time. about me sometimes. Yeah, all the time. They would never guess what, what, what happens when you drop it on them?

Speaker 4:          03:24:57       It depends, man. Like, uh, sometimes you get a, like a big, you can see the shame wash over them, you know, they say something rude at the end. I'll say like, have a nice day. I think like, I hope you have a great day rest of your day. And they're like. And then sometimes they laugh, sometimes, you know, I've had it go even. I remember in high school my cousin came from Peru and we went into, it was the reverse. We went into a gnc. Yeah, we were like 14. And I go in spanish because he's visiting. I tell them just places easy to steal from. And then I don't realize that the, uh, the lady working at the store was spanish, so instead of she just let us kind of look around and then, and then she started speaking us in spanish and we were like, oh, we thought we were speaking to some crazy code, you know, like, this isn't fucking, you know, farsi that you're going to run into a lot. It was spanish, but it happens all the time in. They also, I also realized it's probably, I don't know if it happens to you because I don't look spanish. A lot of times spanish speaking, people don't want me to speak spanish to them, was that if they're here, they're, they're not appreciating that you're not letting make, letting them show you that they could speak english. A lot of times that's, it

Speaker 1:          03:26:12       just tanked because americans wouldn't give a fuck if you were over in Italy and so started talking english and you had like one of those translators you trying to like, um, yo soy, try to talk to him and he just started saying, no problem. I speak perfect fluent english. Thank god it's just talking here. It's different though. You would never be like, oh, let me struggle sometimes to somebody that I speak way better spanish than they speak english real. It's still insist on keeping it english. That's rough. It gives them like with me, they look at me for a minute and then once I start going off. Yeah, like those. Hello? Como? Anybody could say those? Yeah. It's when they asked me, how's your day going? Like when somebody spanish system and get that, I always say I eat for how long [inaudible] been compounded and they look at me and I tell them I'm here fighting with these fucking white people on a day and they look at me and go, oh, okay.

Speaker 1:          03:27:03       He's okay. But the guy at the weed store at cushman. Yeah, they used to be a little security guard and I didn't say nothing to him. He never looked at my name. He would just look at joey or something and he would go away that go the ate the fat italian, just let him roll for like eight times and one day I said, oh yeah, you're going to feel and look at that particular pet or the normal are porter and his face turned back like he had a gun and everything and he got paid because they said, never disrespect me and I'll never disrespect you. You son of a bitCh. He just turned pale a week. Ladies, I come in, I'm going to get you discounts on weed up in the valleys. Sure, sure. Because he. I lived in hollywood at the time, but I would catch people, but it's really weird.

Speaker 1:          03:27:49       Yeah, some people don't. Some people don't. Some people are cool with it. Dude, you ain't seen somebody kill until you seen joey diaz do half spanish. Half english in miami at the improv. I bet in 2004, 2000. Three, 2004. When that place was crazy. Crazy. either one. I could go off. I'm sure I could go. Was really funny in spanish. People get grades I imitate is the people that you know. I grew up around the cuban guys I grew up around with. Very funny. I was telling a friend of mine, he that was bartending in highschool, adequate highschool and bartend and there was this bookie that hung out there. His name was our nardo and he didn't speak no english and I used to talk to him. He was a cuban do built. We had a big, big gut and one day he was sitting on a chair like this and my buddy was joked and he's telling them about your yo yo come by.

Speaker 1:          03:28:44       And he goes, I gotta go. My friend goes, what are you going to go home? We didn't even speak spanish or nardo. He goes, well, and my friend goes, what he talking about? I never forgot nardo was sitting in a bar chat and go back and he just started going, oh, well when I go home now, forget it. And they started making believe like he was jerking off and he would make the noises. I have never been to. This bar is looking at a decade now, but he's going, I wouldn't, he would come, he would pop back in the chair and go,

Speaker 5:          03:29:13       blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 1:          03:29:17       The whole fucking bought fucking. And then he would sit back and go, oh, oh, you're living. Yes, I bought. He would play out the whole thing. Jerking off hands.

Speaker 5:          03:29:40       Oh,

Speaker 1:          03:29:46       the people you run into in your daily life. If you do that today, they'll put you in jail. I, uh, have you. If you do that today, have you leaned back in a bar and start jerking off into the sky? Oh my god. Didn't put you in jail. That's sexual assault just to do the impersonation. I'm sure didn't jim morris and getting in trouble for that? He pulled his dick out. He pulled his dick out of my la. Yeah, it was. He pulled his dick out. Famous concert. But I thought that during mr. Mojo rising, he would make believe he was whacking off when he got arrested. I think, uh, our boy who got arrested, the comedian for doing something on stage, like a sexual something. Which guy? The original guy, lenny lenny did. I think he just got arrested for talking. I don't think he ever pulled his dick out. I think that. I'm not saying it was thicker. I mean like doing the motion. Oh, maybe.

Speaker 3:          03:30:40       Yeah. Yeah, yeah. We definitely get prosecuted for profanity. Was iT sam? Jim morrison's. Many of the, nearly 12,000 youths said they found the bearded singers exhibition, disgusting, including included in the audience were hundreds of [inaudible] escorted junior and senior high school girls. Morrison appeared to masturbate in full view of the audience, screamed, upset idis, and exposed himself. He also got violent slugged, several and in parentheses, concert promoters and through one of them off the stage before he himself was hurled into the crowd with his dick hanging out. Wow. Interesting. He says to this day, Morrison's bandmates denied this version of events as a guitarist. Robby krieger explained the spinner. They were complaining about jim whipping out onstage, which he didn't do. 500 photos were entered as evidence that trial and not one of them showed anythIng of the sort. Regardless, after rejecting a plea bargain, the singer was found guilty of misdemeanor counts of indecent exposure and open profanity and sensitive sentenced to prison time and find the case was on appeal at the time of his death.

Speaker 3:          03:31:54       July third, 19, 71. Wow. Interesting. And cleMency board in 2010 voted to pardon the singer more than 40 years later. I'm who the fuck those would happen if they don't have a picture of his dick out. I thought they had a picture of it. If they don't have a picture of his dick out, somebody could have yelled his dick's out, which is just like yelling fire in a crowded building. He started hearing thing at the end of the la woman, ms dot mojo raja, and then at the end he would make believers rise. Rise route. whoa. Yeah. Maybe to them it looked like masturbation to him. It looked like he was playing like an air guitar. Right? He pretended to jerk off. Yeah. Maybe you're not allowed to do that back then. Really? I would deny like a good 40 percent of all of our material. It's a lot of it. If someone told you you can't fake jerk off on stage of life, am I going to make this bit work? There's a couple of specials that are gone entirely. Fuck. That was one of my best ones. Shit broke it. They edit out all the stroke and their parts. You'd be like, oh, I'm so limited in my game. God dammit. Get the fuck out of here. What the fuck? Joe diaz. It's only three and a half hours into the show.

Speaker 3:          03:33:09       I got to pick the baby up. Listen, this is one of my favorite times ever. Oh mY god. I'm going to have to review it and find out what the fuck you said. That made me laugh until I literally couldn't breathe. But, uh, to everybody that's been on the show. Thank you. Thank you to everybody listening. Thank you.
