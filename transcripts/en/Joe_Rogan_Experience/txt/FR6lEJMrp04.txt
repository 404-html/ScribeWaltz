Speaker 2:          00:00:41       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:00:46       Zam brothers and sisters were going to go on a journey today. All right. We're back from the journey back from Las Vegas. Well, a, I met Anthony Bordain. What am I here? I got fucking starstruck. I met, you know Anthony Bourdain and my friend Yon Urban is here. Anthony, do you watch TV at all or you just fucking read in books all day? I haven't had a TV turned on around me and probably a couple of years. Wow. You completely out of the cultural loop textbooks on mushrooms from the 15th. Right. What happened? Uh, Anthony, what'd you do? Did you change the volume of it was just turning it down and lunch. She stopped doing that fucking Weirdo. Leave that shit alone. Uh, Anthony Bourdain's a chef and he's got this television show. He was a chef. Now he's pretty much like sort of this traveling, uh, Guy, uh, who, uh, samples, food and different restaurants all throughout the world, but more as like a commentator on the cultures of these places, you know, and uses food as sort of like a way to get you to know the culture, you know, uses like eating with indigenous people and he's like tribes and weird fucking crazy places.

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       I mean, it's a bad ass fucking show interest and it's my favorite show. And so I met him and you know, just of just no one, some just, it's the weirdest fucking thing when you admire someone and you liked their work and they know who you are too, you know, and, and all of a sudden you're talking about stuff and he came to my comedy show. I'm like, it seems like it shouldn't freak me out at this point in my life, but I'm still like Holy Shit Anthony Board days in the fucking audience. Like it was, it was weird, you know, it was, it was interesting. He's a bad motherfucker. I uh, I admire him very much. He's a, one of the most interesting guys on television, so he's going to do the podcast. He said he gets asked to things on Twitter one go fuck himself and two if you would do the Joe Rogan podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       So it's his words. Yeah, he's cool as fuck dude. And his wife is a, a phene for mixed martial arts. His wife takes Jujitsu and Moy Thai and they have a pattern up upper room in their house and you know, and she's got fucking trainers teach her how to strangle people and Shit. Wow. Yeah, she's a freak dude. She's like so like aggressively into it. It was crazy watching like her like fucking scream and yell and get all excited at the Wayans and Shit, you know? And he sort of, it seems like he sort of a, okay, I don't want, this is what she loves. I will go along for the ride, but it just, you know, I don't know if he would be into it other than that, you know, I don't, I dunno. Maybe I'm wrong. It didn't seem like he was as into it as she is though.

Speaker 1:          00:03:21       She seemed really into it. His wife is like a fucking super fan. She's like on it. It's like owning a gun. She's, she's his gun probably. Yeah. She's shut. Fuck you up dude. She's into it, man. Yeah. He like tweeted once, you know, I think her name was Octavia activity of Bordain choked out or trainer. Put them to sleep. Wow. He's tweeting about, that's interesting. I don't know if I could date a girl that was more stronger and tougher and crazier than me. You know, I need to take control of situations. I need to make sure I can do that. Not like, no, I don't want to watch

Speaker 3:          00:03:52       whatever gay movie you want to watch. I mean, sorry, silly movie that you went to watch a and then she'll just check me out. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:58       Wake up and you know. Well, it would be more of a struggle than that. I would hope he learns so defense after awhile, son, having tasers protect your neck. Yeah. I think that's a weird dynamic, man. When the girl can kick your ass. I don't think I'd be into that. But you know what? Some people are, everybody's different man, and he's obviously not in the physical fitness and, and he's a wild dude. Won't take some chances. He'll rod that crazy snake. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? He'll jump on that IOWASCA snake and go for a ride. But he's in the best pussy eater. You think so? Yeah. And this is just a champion because he's so into, I mean that's his job. I'm the best eater in the rural, well, he's more of a cook than it eats. Like the best eater would be that man versus food guy who just eats piles of shitty food every week or used to it, doesn't he not eat anymore?

Speaker 1:          00:04:43       Yeah. That's what a Bert Kreischer was telling us, or are we not supposed to say it was always that, oh wait, I've already, we've already started showing it, but he doesn't do the stunts anymore because it's fucking body was falling apart because it's poor guys eating, you know, 20 pounds cheeseburgers every night while they're filming. And you know what I mean? He's, he's ridiculous food challenges where he would have to eat like, you know, in some insane amounts of food. Right. Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't ever really watched, I saw clips. I wonder if it's that, or if he's just dating a girl. She's like, well, my guy to getting so fat. And he's like, you know what I mean? Like, dude, you can't control that. How could you possibly eat that much food? Yeah. It's, yeah, it's terrible for you. But you know, getting fat is really unhealthy. Yeah. You know, I mean, you've been fat and you've been skinny, you know, don't you feel way better when you're skinning? Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:05:28       yeah. But I also like eating, you know, I was, you know, I was thinking about that the other day. I was like, you know what? When I was in a hardcore diet, I made sure I only ate certain kinds of food. You know, like I would only eat like chickens and and salads and stuff like that. But then I was like, you know what? If I wanted to Lasagna, I couldn't have lasagna. You know? To me it's like, wait a second. You know what I mean? I would rather be somewhere kind of in the middle where I still eat healthy most of the time, but I need to fucking bad

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       once in a while. That was in Vegas. That is the best fucking food. Vegas has the best food. Well, you only have an issue in that. You don't exercise. If you exercise, you can still waiting for 24 hour fitness to open up in Burbank. It's just, it's impossible to work out. You're so unmotivated. All you need is one thing to be wrong. It takes a radio, doesn't work in my car. I'm not going to drive all the way to the gym with no radio and they fixed my radio. Then I'll start going to the gym again. I agree. You will find, I hate exercise, but if I, if I, if I do it, I want to do it right. I want to have a nice gym. It's so much easier to have a gym at your disposable. Anthony Bourdain's wife can learn Jujitsu. You girl [inaudible] why don't you learn something and see just the good thing about it is, you know, what tires you out?

Speaker 4:          00:06:40       I've known you for what, eight years? Yeah. At least you know, and you've worked with him for eight years and you know, Joe and Eddie were trying to get me to train in Jujitsu eight years ago, but I don't hang out with them everyday. So what the fuck, dude, you would've done it. I would've totally done it if I didn't have an hour and a half, two hour drive every time. But I mean like what the fuck is your excuse? My knee is my biggest excuse. We've talked about this already a thousand times and I have a bad knee and Jujitsu. It's all about fucking twisting bones and bodies and you know, and that does not seem like it's a good idea. Like, Hey, do I want to have knee problems for the rest of my life? Do I want to deal with all the fucking bullshit that's going to come along with doing Jujitsu?

Speaker 4:          00:07:20       Like fucking getting ringworm and, and all that crap, or do I want to get a membership at 24 hour fitness was like, someone literally is a glass half empty sort of fellow. You know, there's, there's positive benefits from these things. It's not like there's only all these negatives you're saying? No, no. I'm sure if all these negatives as if there's nothing for you to be learned there. I didn't have a brother growing up and so like rolling around with a guy's still at this, not worried about, no, it's just like, I don't if it was a guy versus girl Jujitsu, I'm 100% end. I'll fuck, fuck my knee. Who Cares? You know? I just don't feel like rolling around on the floor with a guy. I don't know why. Same reason if somebody goes, hey, would you rather hang out with three guys and watch sports?

Speaker 4:          00:08:05       Or would you rather hang out with three girls and watch porn? Yeah, I wouldn't have to say that. It's sort of a learned thing, you know, it's like an acquired taste. Yeah, it does. It's, I've been doing it for so long, it's just totally normal to me, but there's times I've thought about it. There's Times where I'm rolling with a guy and I know his sweat is in my mouth. Yeah, no, no. Getting around it. There's no getting around it. Like if a guy like say a few are like you're doing Nogi in, you know, a guy's on top of you and you've got them in half guard or something like that and he's sweating. His chess could easily be on your face. Yeah. And your bold drenched with sweat. I, if I had to do it, I would definitely do geeky with two comforters are wrapped around near something. You're exchanging fluids, you know, you're exchanging your sweat, your moisture. I mean they're not really exchanging, but you're getting it on each other to have, now it's not going internally, but it does go into scratch

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       is the largest organ of the body and shit does go right through the skin. So

Speaker 4:          00:09:00       it does. It does. That's why men have to constantly worried about Matt herpes, herpes, or real. You have to worry about that. You have to worry about skin, like ringworm type shit. You have to worry about staph infections. A lot of guys, it's dirty motherfuckers, man. Most everybody's different. Like Ari, they only changed their sheets like once every month and a half, you know? So He fucking, he got staff. That fucking guy would just go to Jujitsu and then not shower. I was like, why are you crazy? You would just roll around with dudes and then not shower. Why don't you just have people just shit on you? Yeah. You know, just to have people just piss all over your body, you know? Like what are you doing when you got to clean yourself off, man? So what have you, so you've got staff. There was, yeah, he didn't even know he had staff. We were playing pool and he's limping around and I go, what's going on?

Speaker 5:          00:09:43       I got bit by a spider. Yeah. Yeah. I did hear about this.

Speaker 6:          00:09:47       He pulls his pants up to show me the spider bite. I'm like, dude, that is, that looks like a staph infection and you should go to the hospital right now. You get a check. Like you can't just walk around like that, but he didn't know. He had no idea that you could actually get something like that from exercise, from Jujitsu, you know, you don't really hear about people getting staph infections, lessons from surgery, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:10:06       Well most sports you don't get staff like you're playing tennis, you don't get to staff, you know?

Speaker 6:          00:10:10       Yeah. Football players can get it. They get it. Sometimes. It's tricky. It's very, very dangerous. Very dangerous. And you know, of course there's that, you know, Murcia the a antibiotic resistant staph infection that they've have now. That's really dangerous because you know, it's, it's a very, very strong form of it and it's very hard to kill. It's from mostly from people not taking their antibiotics correctly.

Speaker 5:          00:10:34       Yeah. And what, what I've found to one of the best things to get rid of like a athlete's foot and shit, which I'm sure you get an environment like that a lot, is a apple cider vinegar. He rubbed that stuff on it a couple of times and it's gone. They say supposed to pee on your feet too. Yeah, that works too. My feet every faster though. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:10:51       Yeah. Why not move? Why not? Not Bad for you. It's not bad for you and it's a warm, yeah, it comes from my own body. I is it like what doesn't even leave my body? It's one continuous stream. It's not like it leaves, yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:11:00       Body at all. It must have been about what, 2004 2005 I was living up in the mountains and my phone starts ringing and it was like probably one 32 o'clock in the fucking morning. Right? And I don't get, or I get up and I answered the phone and it's fucking this dude. It's Joe and he's on the phone. He's like, dude, I'm sick as fuck man. I gotta be at the studio at like 6:00 AM I feel like shit. What do I do? And I, I tell us how it drink. Drink a couple of glasses of your pis and it'll make you feel better. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:11:31       Giggling with a finger in your butt when you told him so.

Speaker 5:          00:11:36       So anyway, I'm fucking, I got it back to bed. Right. And then, uh, it must've been like three, three 30 in the morning and my phone rings again. It's fucking Joe. This time I don't get up to answer it. I would just fucking lie in bed and I, and I hear the answering machine pick up and it's Joe. He's a dude. I gotta tell you man, I just drink two glasses of my peers, dude. I feel fucking great. I gotta tell you man, I'm a peer streaker too. If when people don't know, this is very controversial

Speaker 1:          00:12:09       obviously, but there's a thing called year in therapy and the idea behind it is that your body processes waste and that waste comes out in the form of Shit. But that also when water waste comes out, the water that comes out of your body is actually sterile and that there are some sort of nutrients in it and antibodies when you're trying to get over colds and things of that nature. And so a lot of doctors say it's utter complete total horse shit. But people in indigenous cultures, for instance, who've been doing that to try to cure diseases and illnesses for a long, long time. Obviously modern medicine is way better than drinking your own

Speaker 5:          00:12:50       piss. Well, you know what's interesting though is in, in India, every year, every couple of years they have a meeting of doctors who meet up to, to discuss the latest research and you're in therapy. Uh, I knew somebody who went to the doctor in South America for a skin problem and was told to drink their urine. Whoa. So I, it is, it's not, you know, it's, it's very rarest I think, especially in the United States, but I think in India and China and certain places in South America, it has been adopted.

Speaker 1:          00:13:22       He's been adopted by modern medicine, adopted by freaks. Listen, I'll try anything, man. I'll try anything. I've been in zone healers before. I'm like, look, I don't, every instinct in my body is telling me this is nonsense. But go ahead. Let me see what's up. You know, let me see what's up. I just, I'll listen to you. I listen to you and maybe even just for material, you know, maybe even I don't believe it and I just, just in the interest of this might be something that would be funny to talk about on stage. I'll let you try your Voodoo on me. But you know, it's like nature makes things look shocking and scary because they're poisonous if they want to. If, if, if you were supposed to drink your pee, it would taste like fucking stronger. It doesn't taste bad at all.

Speaker 5:          00:14:01       Well it actually, it tastes without what you ate that day. I mean, if you drank a bunch of coffee and soda pop and ate a bunch of crap food, it's probably going to taste pretty fucking bad. But if you eat healthy and take care of yourself, you know, I've done it a few times as you know, when I was sick and uh, and something else that we'll talk about later when a, I was on mushrooms and you can recycle your urine and it's supposed to put you through Pluto. Right. And it doesn't taste bad at all, but it's very much, dean is like people that do it for health reasons, they say that it enables them to monitor their body on a regular basis of what their intake is because they immediately taste it and it's like, oh shit. Well I don't want to eat that anymore. I don't want to do that anymore. It's like it, it's an automatic alarm system, right?

Speaker 1:          00:14:49       Yeah. It doesn't taste bad bro. It's not that bad. I did it on the radio rather. And uh, there was a radio station, no name show in San Francisco. What it no anymore is it didn't name was no name, Huh? Yeah. Me and no name drank our own p remember? Oh yeah, he drank, he drank and he was gagging and I just threw it down like it was nothing for God was like, I drank my own pissed like 10 times. Right. You know, I, I mean I'll do it on a regular basis, but there was a big thing about Leo Machida in the UFC that Leo Machida does it. And then his father, who was this karate masters trained him since he was young boy. He recycles his urine every morning, every morning and gets up and drinks his pig. Who the fuck knows man, it might be bullshit. But if people have been doing it for that long, there might be some merit in it.

Speaker 5:          00:15:35       Yes. I've had people come up to me when I've given lectures and say that they've taken it for various, you know, gout or leg problems and, and pain problems and after, you know, four to six, eight weeks there, their problems cleared up. It's all over their gout. He's, you know, they would lay with for a week they would drink like a, a small amount, like a half a cup every, every morning fresh, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:15:58       really. I would, I would try it once, but I would definitely make sure I ate a bunch of berries and I would just make it good. How to cook it good. I'd be a good chef. You know, I don't recommend coffee before you do it. The first thing you can really start getting coffee for breakfast this morning. It's just, you know, there was a guy who used to post on the message board until he got to creepy and someone bandom cause he was just, uh, I forget what his deal was, but he would, he would get these girls that like didn't have any money and they would uh, take care of them for a little while and eventually do like a bunch of dirty shit to him like he was into and write stories about this. And one of the things he would do is make as loads tastes disgusting as possible.

Speaker 1:          00:16:40       So he would talk about the, the asparagus coffee loads that he would name on it. I don't remember honestly, but I remember he made a lot of people angry because they were like, well, if this guy's telling the truth, he's a real piece of shit as a human being. And if he's just trolling like, stop, stop making up some fucking story. Say it's trolling, but you never know. Who knows, man. I mean most likely, yeah, most likely trolling. But either way, it was really good writing. It was compelling. I didn't like him in his writing. I didn't like who he was, but it was very compelling and I was like, this is interesting. It's like this is, it's obviously very good and very well written because the idea behind it is kind of gross to me that you would like go out of your way to take some poor woman who doesn't know what to do with her life and she's really broke and you forced her into, you know, doing weird shit for you because you know, that's how you get off and then you write about it, you know, like that's like you're victimizing people and why, why are you doing that?

Speaker 1:          00:17:34       But not knowing whether or not it was true or not true. You know, choosing to look at it from the point of view. Like maybe it's just fiction. Maybe this guy is just into the mind of a creep. You know, who knows, who knows? But it's really well written, but he was all into just gross loads

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       is apparently a recipe. Joe Diaz will tell you how to make it come out like shotguns. Uh, I, yeah, I stay at this horrible hotel. All right. Last night we were in Vegas and I didn't know it was a hotel that's next to a strip club that we did a show at. And uh, I think that the guy that owns a strip club owns the hotel and it's one of those boutique hotels where you walk in and there's nice paintings everywhere. Like every room was a different theme of painting and I were really cool. But after six o'clock, it turns into a nightclub that ope that's open til like 8:00 AM and it's just the gay, the gay people, the ravers 6:00 AM 8:00 AM it goes about NATO, what times? It starts at 6:00 PM 6:00 PM so we, we got back to the hotel and there was like, you know, lines of people getting into the hotel and the red rope and they're like, you have to wait in line.

Speaker 4:          00:18:38       I'm like, no, we're staying here in, they're like, oh, go through. We could want in the whole lobby is a rave. And I'm like, what the fuck is this place? So we go upstairs and then looking out the window and it was one of those views where it's like you're just looking at air conditioning units. Like it's the roof, but there's just people that were sneaking in through like this air conditioning unit and going up there and doing like crazy drugs and having sex right outside your window. And then I'm thinking, wow, sneaking in through the air conditioning unit. What do you mean there was doors, there was a door going through the floor and they were climbing out and like all these people are hanging out on the roof outside of our window. It was fucked up. And then I'm looking at him like these beds were PR are probably just made for having sex with hookers and the process in like strippers that are coming from the Strip club, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:19:24       And so there's that red pillow that's a was on the bed was like one of those fashion pills that you throw on the ground. You don't really sleep on. There is this come all over it dude. And then, and then, uh, the, the, the channels, the TV, cause we were on shrooms, so we were like, just trying to watch TV and you can't hear anything except, you know, like whole time turn on the TV and it was just scrambled porn. Like you straight on anal sex pops up on your TV and you're like, what the fuck minute scrambled. It was a scramble it and it was, it was channels were porn and then it's tons of scrambled porn mixed in like you'd go to a channel, it's just like what is going on in that? And then it would be like NBC and then suddenly scrambled porn channel.

Speaker 4:          00:20:02       Fucking weird. Then all the lights just turned off and turned into, explained that it was porn and then it would, it would go to NBC. Yeah. Like the channels were mixed up with porn and then scrambled porn. So you'd whatever channel you would watch, porn would just invade the champ. No, no, no, no, no, no. Like, like you turn to NBC and you turn it to the next channel. It'll be a guy getting his ass hole licked by a girl. There's not porn on NBC. No, no, no, no. Okay. Then there was, it sounded like you remember scrambled porn back in the day where it's just a bunch of static. Yeah. You go to a hotel room and they would have like pay per view channels and you could click on it and you wouldn't be able to see any doors kinds of that. It was, it was so weird and then the lights didn't turn on and off. They turn on and off when you wanted to and they were like, yeah, this is an eco friendly hotel where you put your key

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       in and it controls the air conditioning and the lights, which means the air conditioning didn't work and all the lights were just flashing on and off whenever they want it to. And then the, the, the pool area, topless ploy area, but like 90% of the girls where you're like, Holy Shit, I have your chest than her. Or, I mean she has a Harrier tested me. It was fucking the worst hotel in the history of hotels, but it was

Speaker 1:          00:21:12       for the time we, the worst hotel you got out alive. Here's some hotels in Russia, but stitches where your liver, he used to be, right? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:21:20       Yeah. It sounds like the hotel,

Speaker 3:          00:21:22       it was crazy. It was one of those hotels where they like some of the fashion of the room was these like little mirrors that were placed everywhere on the wall and you're sitting there thinking, I wonder if this cameras underneath all those mirrors, you know, like it seemed that sketchy. Like what the fuck is it? Very easily. Very easily. If it's owned by that Strip club too.

Speaker 1:          00:21:40       Yeah. Wow. Ooh. I remember that one guy, there was a guy who got caught and he was some really, really famous rich guy. Not A, not a fit and famous rich guy, but a famous rich guys son. I don't remember the guy's name. But anyway, they found all these fucking cameras in his house. Like this guy had his house like set up as basically like a little film studio and everything was hidden cameras and just hundreds of videos of him just with these drugged up checks, it would come in stumbling in and not knowing what the fuck, you know, he put something in there, drag or something. And then he was filming all of it. Do you remember that story?

Speaker 3:          00:22:17       Yeah, I do. I haven't combined two stories. How long? I don't know. I remember that though. Like he found shit, like his phones were all tapped. There was cameras in everywhere. Like in his lights and everything.

Speaker 1:          00:22:27       No, no, no, no. This guy did it on purpose. He set up his room, his bedroom like that. And then they suspected them of drugging checks.

Speaker 3:          00:22:35       I was thinking of a story where a guy found out that he, his whole house was bugged anything. So that was the government and it was from like three years ago. I can't remember. Who Cares?

Speaker 1:          00:22:42       Well, there was that Hemingway thing. It's just came out, you know, Hemingway thought that the government was following him and it turns out their war. They were tablets, phones, they were following him. So he was right and it was like what they say, you know, some people say the, the last straw that drove Hemingway to commit suicide and that he was a, people thought he was just paranoid but in fact the government really was watching him. Like why the fuck would you be watching a writer? You know, like what do you know? The idea I guess is that he was too close to the communist or something like that. Cause he was always in Cuba. You know, he was just fucking to overthrow the government or something. Just being a bad ass being Hemingway.

Speaker 5:          00:23:20       Yeah. You know, there was so much intelligence going on on different levels. You had this whole dialectic between communism and capitalism on one level being steered by bankers higher up. But all of this stuff, you know, that goes into a lot of my current research right now. In fact, I've got council on foreign relations documents sitting right here next to me from them talking about mushrooms, stuff like that. You know, these are the key players in the council on foreign relations. People are in a crazy stuff on so many levels, you know? Yeah. And you were messing up people's heads and the CIA messing with people's heads. Mk Ultra, they've been, they've been spying on people and mess with people forever. Of course. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:24:03       And you, you would, you would have to think that anyone with any level of intelligence who is in any position of power would want to know about chemicals to change people's minds. He'd want to know about it. You know, you, you, you wouldn't just ignore it. You wouldn't just say, oh, we need to make this illegal. They would start looking into some things. There's no way they have, it would be crazy not to.

Speaker 5:          00:24:25       Well, interestingly, what I've found out recently is that there was this exclusive club that a lot of these elitists and bankers and intelligence people belonged to, and they would share the information on psychedelics at the highest levels. I mean, pretty much everybody at the highest levels from the 1940s through the 60s knew what was going on about psychedelics on every level before the public did. And, uh, yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:24:55       I would think they'd have to, I don't know how you could be any position in any position of power and not be aware of something that powerful. Something that's, you know, like the whole movement of the 60s and whether people want to wrap their head around it or not. That was all drugs. That whole, you know, that whole acid culture that was coming out of San Francisco, that whole, that whole summer of love, that, that, that generational gap, that huge leap between the 1950s and 1960s that was all drugs, man. There was all drugs. It was all people smoking pot and people doing heroin and people, you know, getting high on mushrooms and acid and feeling things that they had never felt before and being able to express things in a way they never felt before and the disenfranchised every fucking generation filled disenfranchise man. There's no getting around that. It's impossible to get around it. Everybody wants to escape from their fucking parents. Clutches. Everybody wants to escape from the designs of a system that's they've been thrust into. You know, you've been born into this fucking system that you have to participate in without you having any say in it whatsoever. Just boom. Every fucking single generation feels like that. But that generation got ahold of some shit.

Speaker 5:          00:26:03       Well, you know, lawsuit. And the interesting thing, you know, and, and here I've got literally a stack of stuff right here. This is all council on foreign. We're going to go through that in a podcast. Mr Oh, I'm just showing you guys, we're not going to go through it, but there is some serious stuff right here that shows how top members of US intelligence like Allen Dulles, John Foster, Dulles, uh, Bank bankers like, uh, frank [inaudible] and other guys like Walter Lippmann, all of these intelligence people as well. We're at the highest levels involved in all of the psychedelics. I all idea guys knew it. I have no idea who any of those people Alan Gomes was. Hold on, let me see if theorists out there, I'll know who Allen Dulles is. I have no idea any of those people are. But I do think that if I was like a total like Internet conspiracy Geek and he just hit me with all those names in a row, I would have the Uber obscure named Guy Hard on right now. Those right now get the fuck out of those.

Speaker 3:          00:27:08       I was thinking about all those documents. Don't they haven't like in pdf form now you can. You can just have him like I have all these documents on my phone.

Speaker 5:          00:27:15       Think right here is eight gigs and the only reasons why it's eight gigs because the 16 gig ones for some reason that they don't process well with our, our little MP three recorder. We don't need your crazy papers. Your stacks of nonsense. The problem with that is we don't believe it and that's the top paper man. If it's digital, you can do anything digital shit. We can do anything to paper ship to the age of knowing what the fuck anything is is over. Those days are done man. You're not going to know what's real and what's not real anymore. It's just, it's going to be, it's too tricky. There's two pictures of Megan Fox getting fun, have a systematic method of figuring shit out anymore. That's the big problem. That is a problem. But the other problem is the ability to manipulate information, Matt matter. It's just too, if you have a systematic method of filtering it, then you know how to spot bullshit right away. You know it's, it's, yeah, maybe there is, there is a way to do it. Actually there's, there's experience and instincts too. You know, there's certain times when you look at something, Brian's pretty good at spotting a internet meme sort of bullshit. Right? Well you got it. You nailed them. I say you had all the people that I know, you probably have the highest success rate for nailing Internet meme.

Speaker 3:          00:28:22       I think I'm pretty good at with it in life to just meeting people, judging people. I'm, I overthink everything and try to like play out all these different,

Speaker 5:          00:28:31       same area. If you guys ever studied logical fallacies, no. That gets really good because it shows you exactly how people lie and then enables you to name the exact lie that they're using. So it gives you explicit knowledge. So like if somebody uses an ad hominem worker, an attack on the man right there, let's say you say something, you make a claim and they say, oh, well Brian's a fag. I don't want to listen to anything. He says, well then you know, oh, well that's an ad hominem. He didn't deal with the information that Brian presented. He attacked Brian instead. There's all of these network. Exactly. No, there's all these new macro fallacies. So you, when you can name them though, it totally enables you how to, to know when somebody's lying to you. And so when you can understand that.

Speaker 3:          00:29:15       See, now I have like this energy thing where I think it's, I really think it's mushrooms are soggy psychedelics that it's kind of enhance this, that I could actually look at people and kind of hear him talk and look at their eyes and face and not actually study it. Just an overall, I could feel they're kind of like an energy almost like I can see if this person's a little dark in places and kind of like, it's weird.

Speaker 5:          00:29:36       It's true. There's certain people that you're not going to feel yes. It's a sociopath. Yeah. Have you ever

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       had a sociopath snip a new circle and you didn't realize he was a sociopath until like after a while you're like, Whoa, what the fuck is going? You know, Eddie Bravo and I knew I'd do to kill the guy. Yeah, I haven't had that, you know that story. Now what happened? There was a guy his, well he would say his name is Rafael Tory, but that wasn't his real name. His real name was something else. He like invented this name and pretended he was a Brazilian jujitsu black belt and made his way into the mixed martial arts community as a total scam artist. And uh, Eddie had disowned him for lying about jujitsu cause Eddie found out that he lied about being a black belt. He wasn't really a black belt at all. So Eddie like stop hanging out with him cause he's like, this guy's crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:30:19       He's just making things up. Like he had rolled them a couple of times and tapped him out really easy. But then he thought maybe the guy was like being respectful and not trying to roll too hard. But then he realized after a while I go, no, this guy is terrible cause he's not, he doesn't know any Jujitsu. He's not black belt. This is crazy. Anyway, time goes on. That guy killed a guy and uh, he was dating this guy's wife and Lord, this guy back to his dojo apparently, and choke the guy to death. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's deep shit. Killed The guy and then was driving around the dude's car and shit. So I knew that guy, man. I hung out with that guy. I hung out with that guy and his wife. Wow. Yeah. They were over at Eddie's.

Speaker 4:          00:30:56       And you had no, no feeling at all,

Speaker 1:          00:31:00       feeling of danger or any feeling that he was a bad guy. He seemed like just a friendly dude. Just, he hadn't killed anybody yet. I don't think. I mean maybe did it earlier and got away with it. I don't think maybe the posting was so good. Maybe it was just so good. He just couldn't help it. I don't know. I doubt it. But he was already getting it. I don't get the killing part. Yeah. How about you just moved to Florida together or something crazy. We don't have to fucking kill that guy man. Go halfsies on Costco memberships. You don't be crazy. But I think I like to think that I have the ability to spot bullshit and I think I'm pretty good at it. But thank God it troubles me. That got troubles me, the idea that you know that I ran into that guy and had no idea that he was capable of murder because I've met some other people and if you ask me if they are capable of murder I would say yeah probably.

Speaker 4:          00:31:50       This is funny cause like, you know, Dunkin is, would you ever think that Dunkin could be one of those guys that go off and go crazy murder people? Duncan can murder somebody. She was correct because I was looking at, if I haven't seen could, if you had your life, that danger, if you saw it, you know, everybody could, if you were pushed to a position where you felt like you had to, I Love Dunkin a death. But, but he, that the thoughts that he has, and especially when he was in that satanic mode, I was like, really? Is He? Like, I always wondered, oh, well he's just experimental. You know, when he was in the Satanism, he was just being experimental. He wasn't really like, I'm gonna fucking worships Satan. He was like, I think it's fascinating that everybody misunderstands this and what it really is, is there, they're saying they want to be hedonistic, you know, they want to, you know, indulge and pleasures and overeat and have sex and sleep till noon. Like that's like, that's satanism to

Speaker 1:          00:32:39       them, that's like expressing themselves in the most ridiculous and outrageous and self serving way possible as opposed to this idea of, you know, the pious Christian who's trying to serve the Holy Father. Well, you have his fascination with serial killers too, which is amazing.

Speaker 5:          00:32:56       He does. Yeah. Yeah. There is another level to satanism. They, you should check out to mark pass. He was work those interested. He goes into some deep stuff. He used to be at a priest of the Church of Satan Dunkin.

Speaker 1:          00:33:07       Like all artists toys with madness. You know, everybody does. He does it to the most. I that I know. That's why I would think I agree. I agree. He, he's, he gets, he gets deep. He wants, well, he's very experimental with his thought process is, it's one of the reasons why it's comedy so funny and that uh, you know, his, just his sense of the world. This is very unique. I love it. It's a very fascinating take, but it's a couple steps away from crazy. I know. It really is. And it's as it is mine, you know, I am guilty as charged, you know, when people say it would be human, they're like, dude, there's no, you're never going to get out of me than I think in any way, shape or form that I'm some sort of a perfect person. I'm constantly fucking up left and right, trying to patch up mistakes, trying to fucking be on the straight and narrow all the time. But uh, I'm crazy too. I know, I know. Given the right circumstances, the right situation, I could go fucking completely insane. And I think a lot of artists are in that same situation. You know, you, you, you, you know, if everything's going smooth in your life, you don't even know yourself. You don't know what you're capable of. It's when the shit gets ugly that you find out what you're really capable of. You know like Donner Party start type shit where people freeze and you got to eat them.

Speaker 4:          00:34:16       You don't want to start with you first meet somebody, Bro. I'm getting that ass. Snap is his ass is mine. I'll go way over to the dark side up well over some burning sticks because there's so much fat in his meat. He would, yeah, that would be the be delicious pecan. Yet you might be the best. So you're like a fail. I don't know. I feel like a Chubby, very hairy. I think it would have a lot of roots. So it was a pig bro, but a delicious, once you burn that hair off. Come on son. Come on son. I'm black so don't get crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:34:45       Oh, so young. You wrote two books on psychedelics and their relationship to Christianity. You've got the first one that you wrote was the farm aquatic inquisition. Well, that was the DVD I did from Pharma aquatic quick, the quack in there and I see that, yeah. Asked for theology and shamanism was, that was the book, right? So the Pharma cratic inquisition was what you were going to call it at one point in time and then you decided to just do it as a lecture series.

Speaker 5:          00:35:11       Right. Well, you know, it just asked her theology in shamanism. Describe more of what the book is about, which is the, well, we, we published ancient primary texts about ancient son and star worship and Christianity. And we've also published a more recently ancient primary texts on Christian's using mushrooms as well, which is what, uh, my second book is about. And that's the holy month. That's the holy mushroom evidence of mushrooms in Judeo Christianity. But in that book, I published the first ancient, uh, primary texts of mushroom use by Christians. And it was a document called the epistle to the renegade bishops, which is a Canaanite text for the, uh, Orthodox church.

Speaker 1:          00:35:53       You know what I love about yawn before you go any further? I met, I met Jaan years ago. I mean, how long ago have I known you? At least eight years. At least eight years. And when I met Jaan years ago, he was just this really cool guy. I met you over a Jack Harris House, right? We got to Jackson. Yeah, we went to Jack Harris House and yon was just this really cool guy who was a very smart and had a lot of information. But there's a lot of those guys, you know, and they'll tell you things, they'll tell you stuff about this and did you know that the 15th president, Blah Blah Blah. And then you know the fascinating to talk to, but you actually wrote fucking books. You know what I'm saying? Like my man wrote some real ass books, you know, with like references and you know, banner photos got a glossary in this bitch.

Speaker 1:          00:36:35       You know, there's photographs, the color photos are fucking awesome because it's like at a certain point in time it becomes undeniable. And that shirt, the shirt that you have on that is a cardinal. Anybody can see that. It shows the color cardinal and how the cardinals, well, you know the, the ancient Catholic Church period, the ancient Christianity was, they were obsessed with that mushroom. Either miscarry a mushroom or you got it over there. Hold up the, hold up the front cover of the holy mushroom book. It's hard to see because this is a really old painting and it's uh, when you're, when you're looking at it,

Speaker 5:          00:37:10       let me, let me tell him what it is though. On the, on the right side of the window there, up above his baby Jesus riding on the back of Saint Christopher and baby Jesus is in the shape of a mushroom. And we've even had a, a professor of my Qology identify the exact type of mushroom that Jesus is depicted as there. And that's from a month Ferran de Perigord France from the 13th century, from a chapel there.

Speaker 4:          00:37:33       And there's a lot of mushrooms on this fucking wall. So most artists are drug addicts. So wouldn't you think back then that artist they did. It was just like, man, I'd like to get some mushrooms and I got hired to do this. Church is with the mushroom. Let you know if you think about it, he probably got a lot of trouble for that. Right. That's got stoned. They ain't got, a lot of people are probably like, what the fuck Christian Jews and mushrooms. What's that about? You know, imagine if this whole Christian mushroom connection was really just a bunch of taggers. I seriously, I just jokesters who were already as well.

Speaker 5:          00:38:09       We actually do have several primary texts about it. In fact, there's one text found in the Jewish Kabbalah and the book is Zahar. This specifically discusses the mushroom, the red mushroom or the red fungus actually. And uh, like I said, the Christian texts, the epistle, the ring renegade bishops, there's a Muslim texts from, from this, uh, from the seventh century that discusses Manna being a type of mushroom.

Speaker 1:          00:38:33       And Mana was, uh, referred to in

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       other texts as well, and Soma and was referred to in the Hindu text. And that was also thought to be possibly related to her. Right, right. And that there is an argument right now going on between academics. If the Mana that where it says that it's a mushroom in this Muslim mish cat text, if it's talking about a truffle or a psychedelic mushroom and the word there that they use it, you know, it describes the word site and the word site that they, that is written in the original text can be spiritual or visual site. So they're, the debate is whether or not this truffle is a mushroom mushroom or a or a truffle type mushrooms. So, you know, but uh, either way, Matt Maana, Manna appears to have been a type of mushroom, but you know, I have to give John Market will they grow credit?

Speaker 5:          00:39:22       I am the publisher of the 40th anniversary edition of his book. And this book here was actually a really famous book and the uh, we've taught a 1970. Yeah, we've talked about this many times on the show. I republish that a little book. Well this is the new version that you guys published. Yeah, I republished it. Yeah. I work with Gianna lagers, family and two copies of the old original one. Yeah, I've got a couple. I bonded to buy them because I knew they were out of print and there were so it's so great. It was, uh, the new version has a 35 page addendum by Professor Carl Rock from Boston University who has come out publicly endorsing the lagers work, you know, and then plus, like I said, my back's it though any further because there's a lot of people who are uninitiated. All right. Ma.

Speaker 5:          00:40:07       John Marco Allegro law worked for the people that were deciphered the dead. So he was one of the original eight members of the Dead Sea Scrolls team to translate the Dead Sea Scrolls. They, they contacted Oxford University. He was studying for the, his doctorate in philology there, uh, in, uh, Asiatic languages, which the, that part of the Middle East is considered Asia. And uh, so he, that somebody, somebody contacted the university and asked them to send their best. So they recommended John Allegro ago and so he worked to translate the Dead Sea scrolls from 1953 until 1968. He was actually the only member of the tribe of the Dead Sea scrolls scrolls team to ever release any information about the Dead Sea scrolls to the public during the, uh, that period from like 1953 until 1991. And, uh, so he, the other members of the team sat on their information for years and after a huge blow up the Huntington Library and about 1990 91, which is over by Pasadena, uh, they finally released all of their photographs and their possession of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which finally allowed other scholars to get their hands on them and translate them.

Speaker 5:          00:41:22       But John Allegro, up until that point, was the only one that was fighting against the rest of the team to put information out. And of course, they attacked him. If you've got a dead sea scrolls displays today, they almost completely omit them from any mention of a, of the Dead Sea Scrolls. But he was really the key player to get it out to the public. And so in, um, well what happened was in the, in the 1950s, Pr, uh, professor John Rams bottom from the London Botanical Museum published a book suggesting that and Adam and eve and the, and the, and the tree of knowledge was a mushroom and he showed a fresco from France, from, it's called the Plain Crow Fresco. That's how can people find, what is it called? The Plain Crow Fresco and spell that's in the book there. Image number here because it's a fascinating image. Let me see that. Uh, just hold up the back of the book. They're actually, the problem is that most people are not going to see this. This is wrong. Most people are going to get this on Sirius satellite radio or on iTunes. Yeah, but it's p l a I. N c O. U. R. A. U. L. T. Say that again brother. I was talking over you. I'm sorry. P L A I. N C. O. U. R. A. U. L. T. And let me check that again. The painting is amazing if you haven't seen it before. And again, Brian could be right, it could be some crazy artist who's really into mushrooms.

Speaker 3:          00:42:42       Well that's what most artists are into. You know, we'll take it out like that's why they're painting. I've never heard that point before. It's very, it's a very good point. I know every artist and every author like to do drugs there. They're taking these scrolls or Deaton. These guys probably did a lot drugs and they were throwing mushrooms in also like that. You were talking about that maze or whatever. It's called the maze mushroom early. Earlier. What was the mice from that you're calling earlier? Uh, you said it was from the old Hebrew text when you translate it. They said they called mom. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe the author of, you know, cause of that was on my shoulders to the camera. Throw some mushrooms in here cause I like to eat mushrooms too.

Speaker 5:          00:43:15       Throwing it in my holy mushroom book, I published 43 images are paintings that that go from Russia to England, and it shows a pretty widespread use from the early first millennium all the way through the 1890 [inaudible] or late 1800 [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:43:36       So as of God hired someone to write the Bible, and as they do is write me, just draw some mushroom. She's like, yeah, of course he's going to tag the Bible if God, God Pagan, gods busy, he has other things except for looking through deciphering mushrooms. Back to this John Mark old allegro thing. So John Mark Fro Allegro,

Speaker 5:          00:43:53       working in the Dead Sea Scrolls for 1415 years. He, he comes to the conclusion with this book that you are republishing the Sacred Mushroom, the cross, right? And if you allow me, if, tell me if it's correct, his conclusion is that all of Christianity is a gigantic misunderstanding of what it really, what it really is about is the fertility calls and the consumption of psychedelic mushroom, right? And that's the whole religion. He argues that Jesus himself was an anthropomorphism, are a metaphor for the mushroom, for the entheogenic experience itself, not a physical person. And in fact, uh, theologists and, uh, religious experts still today are a debate constantly whether or not Jesus and these characters were a historical, uh, there's a lot of evidence to suggest that they are in fact myths just like Zeus or any of the Greek gods or, or, you know, any of the Hindu gods or any other gods.

Speaker 5:          00:44:49       Um, so, but you know, when you live in your own religion and you have your own beliefs, you tend to take them on as real historical characters. But as I showed him my first book asked with theology in Shamanism, when you compare all of these different religions that hold beliefs like a sun, worship and moon worship in these things as well as psychedelics, and they all start to tie together, when you look at their similarities through a fertility rituals, through psychedelic use and through Sun and star and moon worship. You know, like I said earlier, I published a, a fourth century, uh, texts from father epiphanies where he's sitting there talking about how, uh, the birth of Jesus coincides exactly with the birth of the sun and everything. And then he says, but all of those other pagan religions, they're not the real one. We're the real one. And his text was actually censored for a thousand years by the church until another, uh, older copy of it was later found and published in the 1850s. So they, you know, the church literally tried to suppress one of their own guys, text talking about this stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:45:54       Well, I would assume that if you, if you look at all this religious artwork that has all these mushrooms symbols in them, and we're talking about doorway openings, right, like the, the shape of doorway openings and Jack Herer when he was about to write the Sriracha, open up Astra theology and shamanism and show him some of the door to just audio because like I said, the majority, the vast majority of the people that get this podcast get adjusted. Yeah, that's right. All right. But, um, anyway, what my point was, do you think that how it went down was that all of this knowledge and information about psychedelics was kept from the common person? Was it like only with the powers of the church? Was it? It

Speaker 5:          00:46:37       was, it was kept with, it was kept for the elite. Those who basically have the knowledge of the trivium and quadrivium or had studied the seven liberal arts, they were considered better than the, than the masses or the dead as they're also known are the profane. Right. And so the elites in the educated withhold this information for themselves, the trivium and quadrivium, the psychedelics, the history of philosophy. There's actually, there's also that a lot of people don't know about is there was this ancient conversation. It's 2,500 years old. It's still going on and it's called a, it was called the great conversation, but it's found in a series of books called the great books of the Western World and, uh, leading thinkers and leading experts. Every generation add on to this great conversation. And it's still going on today. It goes all the way from Socrates to today.

Speaker 5:          00:47:27       And a right now it's like 54 or 59 volumes or something like that. It's like a tenure undertaking. But any real expert in the ancient knowledge or in philosophy or anything like that is studied this, this great conversation or has participated in it. And so there's all of these different levels of knowledge. The trivium and quadrivium is the foundation to the great books of the Western world. So you have to have a firm understanding of of this information like the, and all of this is related to the religions as well. But just to give a very quick synopsis, the trivium specifically in this order is grammar, logic and rhetoric and that teaches you how to think and how to learn, not what to think. And then the quadrivium is math, geometry, music and astronomy specifically in that order. Math is number in, uh, math is number, math, geometry is number in space.

Speaker 5:          00:48:21       Music has number in time. And astronomy is number and music and time. And then, so when you have this foundation is number and music and number number in space and time. Music is number and time. Astronomy is number in space and time. Okay, sorry about that. So if this motherfucker, I need a calculator, but what they, what they do is, you know, up until the 1850s, everybody in their schooling was taught the trivium and quadrivium. So then if you wanted to go on to this higher level of education in the great books of the Western world, you could participate. But all of the old grade thinkers were, were in on it basically. So all the old great thinkers were in on mushrooms. But no, well not necessarily in on the mushrooms. They were in on the great conversation. But there are aspects and you know, in my research and in some of these documents here through some of the clubs, it's very clear that that, uh, many members of the elite, like let's say the owner of time life magazine, the head of the CIA, uh, rich finance, here's like Oppenheimer or, or Walter Lippmann or, or, uh, uh, uh, frank asphalt, these guys geek boner right now.

Speaker 5:          00:49:26       Right? All of these guys were in on this top knowledge and they were sharing this information at the top levels. I can actually, you know I have documentation that actually these are from university life, from the CFR archives at at Princeton University and things like that. So I can show you from their own archives and their archives. They talk about mushrooms, they talk about psychedelic drugs. The key players involved, like especially Gordon Wasson, the Gordon Wasson was involved in all levels of US intelligence and he is the guy who in 1957 brought out the story about magic mushrooms and light and magazine magazine. Bright and very famous art. Right. So really sending Gordon Wasson was a chairman for the council on Foreign Relations, right? Henry Luce at time life magazine. He was and bones, but he was also working with, with Gordon Wasson ads. This is what I want to see a our, this is what I wanted to avoid because this is whenever I talked to Yon, he has to go so deep what all this shit and

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       I'm sure it's all real. Well I'm sure it's all real. I'm, I shouldn't say conspiracy. He conspired, they conspired to do something and do they have the documents that show that? That's not interesting to me. What's interesting to me is how this all, what about those audiences might be too far? You go too far and you go too far down to this guy, that guy, I got to take notes on names. I don't know. Honestly, to me it's like you start saying all these names and stuff and I'm still confused because I don't know any of the treatments or take it from an entertainer who knows his audience and he dropped me a wrong way to go with this subject. Draw me a picture because it's a fascinating subject. The idea that all religions experiences come from psychedelic experiences. It totally, completely makes sense. The connection between this Ama miscarry, a mushroom, the relationship that it has to Christmas trees, you know that it has a Michael Riser relationship with the Christmas tree and it grows under him, you know, and that all of these things, these, this is no one knows about this. This is all for some reason has been kept out of uh, public school systems kept out of universities. No, nobody's talking about, it's all about it.

Speaker 5:          00:51:27       It's all being kept from the public education system isn't designed to make you intelligent for your mind. It's designed to make you a good soldier of fact.

Speaker 1:          00:51:36       Right. But, okay. But forget about that. Is there a single course in any accredited university anywhere in the world where they go into depth about the history of psychedelic use?

Speaker 5:          00:51:44       I would say yes. There are a few and you know, and anthropology especially, but a professor Tom Roberts at the University of Illinois has been teaching the oldest running psychedelics course since the 1980s and what does he talk about? He makes me about psychedelic research or as well, yeah. He's also a major archiver of psychedelic information and things like that. So go into depth about like the history of its use. Like John Mako, allegro. Yeah. And people are allowed to, you know, study, you know with the, he allows his people in his class to choose a book and the whole, you know, there's like four or 500 books on psychedelic studies on from all different directions out there and he lets them go out and research these and, and write reports on them. And things like that as part of the class. So That's interesting. I wonder how if he gets talked to by anybody in any point in time, you know, and they have to make sure that he doesn't encourage the use of these and that it has to go through now as I'm sure that they make it.

Speaker 5:          00:52:38       What do you think obvious, but, uh, you know, I interviewed him on my podcast for those who don't know gnostic media.com but gnostic is g n o s t I c media.com. But, uh, he was very open about his own psychedelic use on my show really well is, you know, I've, I've interviewed more than 60 doctors and professors and leading experts in, in psychedelic studies on my show from Stan Grof, who's one of the leading x or the leading expert on Lsd and a bunch of other people. And they're very straight forward about their own personal use. I think there's been one doctor that I've had on Deborah Mash at the University of Miami who said she's never tried the drugs that she researches. Hmm. That's interesting. Um, Strassman's

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       Kinda, he, he doesn't really talk about it that much. Josie,

Speaker 5:          00:53:29       not too much. But, uh, you know, he and I have talked about it a little bit on the side before, but he's not too public about anything.

Speaker 6:          00:53:36       Well, his, if you don't know Strassman as the guy who wrote the book, Dmt, the spirit molecule, which is an amazing book. One of the more recent, uh, probably the most recent study of, of a, of psychedelic drugs that was a approved by the federal government. And He, uh, he's shot these people up, but DMT and they had these fucking incredible visions and incredible stories, like really intense book and a very, very fascinating, but he didn't talk about it too much, but he did tell me about these crazy people that have a loophole in New Mexico and they just got away with doing this. Apparently they just one during the supreme, uh, with, uh, with the Supreme Court. You know, the people I'm talking about, the church that they drink that a wasp wasp, it's not, they call it Hawaii Oscar though you know it, but it is a DMT and orally active.

Speaker 5:          00:54:21       Right. Well, you know, Paska Iowasca there's a few different names for it, but there, same thing, same thing. Would you recommend [inaudible] was it,

Speaker 6:          00:54:29       I think that's the name of it. And they wear, they wear uniforms and they all take like super powerful IOWASCA and then sing songs about Jesus.

Speaker 5:          00:54:38       Right? Yeah. The Santo Daime a church, they won the rights to practice up in Oregon about two years ago. And the Uno de Vegetal is another Iowasca church that operates in the United States and they've had approval for about five or 10 years. How incredible is that? Right? It's like you have the native American church, you have the native American church. The Oakland way on native American church is the only one, only native American church that allows non natives to practice and they practice payoti mushrooms. They pretty much did the whole thing there. Yeah. And non natives are allowed, non natives are allowed in the open of way. How branch and that's run by uh, James Warren, flaming eagle. Mooney Flying Eagle, sir. Yeah. Out there.

Speaker 5:          00:55:20       Let's make something happen. I'm talking about like a yearly thing. Holla at your boy. We could do at legal legal, right. Payoti the desert. You know, and when you think about it, almost all religions, if you go back far enough, they were using psychedelics. It wasn't just the native Americans of the South Americans use Iowasca or you know, it wasn't just the brown cultures, it was the white culture is to, you know, and in genesis, Rachel and Leah are arguing over who gets the mandrakes to have sex with a Rachel's husband. Right? So this is Greek. Mandrake is a, a, is a psychedelic as well as an aphrodisiac. It's a, in the school, Paul, I mean family with the GSS, 10 found new drug. Right. You know, and the, in the, in the song of Solomon's it, in the Song of Solomon, it discusses mandrake there as well. And, uh, there's been a number of people, myself, Jack Hair, that we both knew, Andy Clark, Heinrich of all argued that the entire story in Song of Solomon is actually a, a basically a psychedelic story if you'd look at it. And if the characters are put in context of drugs and red mushrooms with white spots and things, suddenly the story makes a lot more sense.

Speaker 1:          00:56:31       Here's an example, and it is on the same subject though. It doesn't feel that it would be of, uh, you know how we were talking earlier about being able to feel if someone's weird feeling someone's crazy. The first time I was introduced to the subject was the first time I met Yawn, Yawn over Jack Harris Place and Jack Hara was showing me all these photos, which I hope are still around. I hope somebody got those. He had these incredible photos of artwork. We're showed naked people on the block and all and stuff like that. They were under a mushroom. They had like a transparent mushroom and they were naked in ecstasy, dancing as the mushroom. Clearly showing these people under the effect of this psychedelic drug. And so it's me and it's yon and it's Jack and it's Jack's friend and man, Jack's friend. All my alarms are going off. I'm like, this guy is just fucking weird, man. I'm like, this guy is creeping me out. Yeah. You know, like to wait talks. I don't like the way he interacts with me. I'm uncomfortable when it gets close to me. I'm like, how are these people around this guy? I'm like, this guy.

Speaker 5:          00:57:25       Yeah. And I'm just not picking up any of this. And you know, it's funny. It's like, what? It must have been like six months later, I called Joe Up, I'm driving down the freeway one day and I called you up and they're like, dude, you know that guy that was at Jack's House that day? I was all, he just got busted. He's all, and then Joe interrupts me and he said he was a pedophile and I went, oh my fucking God. How did you know? And he's all, I just knew dude. Right? The guy got arrested for being, yeah. The guy got arrested for pedophilia and killed himself in jail. Wow. Or supposedly, oh no, he did. Dude, he can set up this whole, no, he set up this whole little rich little ritual and oh, when he sent a letter to my friend about the whole ritual that he was doing, I mean it was all like, you know, timed with the eclipse and all this shit and with the pope, with Pope John Paul's burial, it was like, what's his pocket with 2005 or some shit?

Speaker 1:          00:58:15       No. Um, I don't know. I just knew, I knew I wanted to kill him. When you're around certain people, when you want to kill him, that's not good. Like when you're, you feel like, you just feel like this is a dangerous animal that's near me. Like, why am I allowing this thing to be near me? I did mine. I don't, you know, like I said, I don't claim to be perfect at this. I did. Raphael Tory guy totally slipped through my radar. My mostly because I was stoned as fuck when I was everywhere. I was hanging around with them. Right. Maybe it was that. Maybe it was just too, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:58:42       we were just known as fuck that day at Jack Harris household places. Good point. Whatever it was, this movement

Speaker 1:          00:58:49       me off. Yeah, it was so, it was so uncomfortable because it was the first time I was meeting Jack and it was a, it was really like, you know, if you don't know who Jack Hara is, Jack Hara wrote the book. The emperor was sank him, rest in peace. Jack. Um, he wrote a book called the emperor wears no clothes and it's a brilliant book where it really breaks down everything that, um,

Speaker 5:          00:59:08       the whole history of standing up and marijuana and medical marijuana.

Speaker 1:          00:59:11       Actually, our friend Todd McCormick has rerelease this and they put a new one.

Speaker 5:          00:59:17       Just have a new edition. I haven't even, the Todd moved up north and I haven't any,

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       I don't have a new one. I still have the old one, but it's my library, which is in the other side of the house. It's like, he's like 12 autograph copies from every edition from jacket. He was a guy who, it's really fascinating story. He was a Goldwater Republican, a real man's man. It was in the military and this guy gets divorced and he made some woman and you know, I wants to get laid. So he gets high with her and now all of a sudden he like realizes the benefits of marijuana and then he gets angry and realize it. Holy Shit. Like we're being fucked over and lied to. Like this stuff is great. And dedicates his life to letting people know how amazing. Literally the father of the hip movement and uh, yeah, so he actually brought industrial hemp back to like 50 comes.

Speaker 1:          01:00:02       That's not him. The guy in the middle, the older guy next to him. That guy. No, no, no. I have photos of the child molester guy. I have a photo of all of us together. All of us, all of us together. You, me and Jack and the dead child molester. Yeah, man, I knew when you called me up, I just knew it sounds stupid. I mean it could have been just a great guest and I'm all cocky like you're a cold. I knew it, but I knew when I was around that there was something wrong with them. I knew it was so obvious to me. I was like, how are these mother fuckers hanging out with this guy every now and then? Like if that's the, the, the danger that you run. If you ever decide to have a party, you know, like one buddy will bring this one dude that's like completely insane and you're like, how do you not know this guy's at the scene?

Speaker 1:          01:00:44       You know, like there's, there's certain people that were like, hang out with one person who is completely off the charts crazy and they just accepted probably cause they grew up with them or something. Yeah. If you're having a party, that motherfucker come over crashing and that's what that guy was. But that guy also, besides being a complete fucking nut and a psychopath and a child molester, he also was like really fascinated by the idea of Santa Claus being the Amanita Mascara machine and the whole history of that mushroom. But people don't know Santa Claus was red and white. The laminated miscarry. A mushroom was written white Santa Claus lives in Siberia and the North Pole, the emoney to miscarry a mushroom that it's, you know, used by the shot. His favorite food is the enemy. We need to miscarry a mushroom reindeer Caribou. Caribou is who characters. That's what they love to eat and they literally will eat your pis.

Speaker 1:          01:01:28       If you're P, if you step outside of a showman lodge, when you're fucking doing these mushrooms and you piss in the snow, they will knock you over to eat your pits for those. You know what I should mention for those interests to, they can go out of my nonstick media website and that's g, N, O, s t, I c media.com and click on the link up at the top for the farmer cratic inquisition DVD. They can watch my whole DVD right there on the website and it's going to take him Adderall before you do this in one year. Right now it's got all the history of Santa Claus and Christmas and an amazing person in there so people can check that out of the guys he takes them to. Girl. There's so much information. So much information. Oh, Adderall is one of those add drugs. It makes you retain everything. Oh really? Yeah. Adderall supposedly as the best. If you ever want to work, make these fuckers. Yeah. It's like cocaine. Yeah. My friend rest his soul, Robert Schimmel, he, uh, he told me once that a, someone else, like in his family or something was on the Adderall and he

Speaker 6:          01:02:20       accidentally take, took it, thought it was something else and a freaked out. He had no, he did. He completely, because he had had a heart attack before and uh, you know, he had, he had some serious problems, some health issues. He had cancer. I'm sorry, we didn't have a heart attack. He had cancer. Um, so, you know, he wouldn't be a fucking with something as crazy as Adderall if he didn't know what it was. But he said he accidentally took it. He called this doctor, doctor said, don't worry about it. You're going to be fine. You just, you know, you'll just be under the effects of it for the next, you know, 10 hours or so, it, whatever the fuck it is. And he said he went on a cleaning rampage. He said he cleaned everything, organized all of his notes on all of his material together. He said, I have never been more focused in my life. It's for like attention deficit disorder and stuff.

Speaker 5:          01:02:59       Yeah. So that's, I'm recommending Adderall for Bush sugar and corn Syrup and red food coloring and shit.

Speaker 6:          01:03:05       Well I'm sure it's caused by a lot of things, but you know, in nutritional deficiencies are responsible for a hoard of diseases. And so many of us just don't eat, you know, they don't, we don't take any vitamins. We don't eat vegetables. People have been asking me about this because I talked about on the podcast about Vitamix blender fucking thing that I got. I don't know the name of it because I'm just sitting right here. I forgot. But um, it, what it is is a blender for it takes these fruits and vegetables and just mashes them down like almost like they're pre digested and that's the idea behind it. That instead of juice, whereas you taking juice, you're squeezing all the liquids out of it and you get a lot of minerals. And nutrients, everything like that. But you don't get as much is when you chop it up and blend it. So you chat with them about it. Kevin James has been on this for the last year or so and she's lost. Like I told you like 80 something pounds when he looks fucking fantastic and he swears by this shit. So what I've been eating is just Kale, cucumbers, pairs, um, and um, uh, raw. Um, what's our stuff? Ginger and I throw it all together in that thing and it doesn't taste that good.

Speaker 5:          01:04:04       But Sally Fallon's book nourishing traditions. No, no. What's that about it? That's a really good one too. She argues that the whole saturated animal fats scare is a complete myth and she's got a lot of documentation to back it up.

Speaker 6:          01:04:19       A lot of people think that animal fat is actually very good for you.

Speaker 5:          01:04:22       Well, she, she proves that a, that there was a good scandal with the oil companies to cover up that animal fats are oil companies, the oil companies, because they were selling these new, newly invented a vegetable oils which weren't around except for olive oil. And maybe him. Boy, you didn't have vegetable oils on the market before the 1920s. So she, even if she even shows that you can, you can parallel the, uh, the explosion of a heart disease and cancer in the United States. Exactly. With the use of vegetable oils. Exactly. Yep. No kidding. And she's got this really good Wii video that you can get it off of Amazon called the oily and of America. What, you know, it's a really slow going video and she's showing all the documentation on the screen. It'll blow your mind.

Speaker 6:          01:05:07       Steve Maxwell's this master fitness guy, trainer guy, he's an incredible dude, but he knows everything about health and nutrition and exercises and said that lack

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       of, uh, animal fat is the reason why some people can get skin cancer. Well, body can't like you, like, like a certain amount of cholesterol, certain amount of like, right. Well you need a combination of things in your body. Basically what causes the heart attacks and heart disease and all of that shit is vegetable oils and carbohydrates, especially process carbos. You know, if you get rid of those things out of your diet, heart disease, obesity, all that shit starts to clear up. You know, certainly eat your vegetables and things, but she says that, you know, what a lot of people do is they'll go out and they'll eat a salad and then they'll pour a salad dressing all over it, which is these processed vegetable oils instead of, you know, all of oil or butter is basically all you want to use on a salad.

Speaker 5:          01:06:01       Any of these other new fangled oils don't eat that shit at all. So it just, what happens when you eat it, your body just has a hard time processing that your body, that's what all this, this trans fat scare and what they also do is, you know, they're allowed to actually put a half a gram or anything less than a gram of trans fat on any packages today is still able to zero trans fats even though in it. Yep, we'll do, do you ever have salad farts salad far to the most uncomfortable farts ever? No. Not Vegetable far salad bars cause that goddamn salad dressing along with all that. Yeah. I usually only use hemp oil or olive oil and balsamic vinegar on myself.

Speaker 4:          01:06:37       He put oil on your salad, credibility signs. Sometimes you just gotta stop, put some fucking strawberries on there in college.

Speaker 5:          01:06:47       You know it's very nutty. It tastes like a very similar to olive oil. True Story.

Speaker 4:          01:06:51       The jerk off with hand boil. No, no, no. I just figured fuck it man. Why not try it? Maybe jerk off with that stuff that actually gets you high. That shit that a, they sell it. The little droppers. Do they sell it? The medical marijuana places jerk off to that cause it's Kinda getting your standard. Dick would be stoned as fuck. That's funny. That'd be probably a pretty good take one states and puts pussy. Well don't people put like cocaine on girls' clips and stuff like that. Talking about you put it on your day off that girl's pussy. Joey, talk about that. I forgot all about that. That hotel in the elevator. I get in and out. We're doing one's doing cocaine in the elevator. There was just a girl just had her little mirror out. Just fucking, I'm like, they didn't care. I walked into the elevator. Hi Vegas.

Speaker 4:          01:07:36       What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. He fuck that shit in the elevator niche. Look at you. You're ratting that grow out. Fuck that girl. There's going to be cops. They're going to invade that place. Good. You know? Look for people, fucking and cocaine. You're going to ruin the whole Party, Brian. Good. Why good? Because you didn't stay at the four seasons and no fucked up. Good, because you should not pay. If if, if I wanted to sleep at the hotel impossible. You should not sell that as a hotel. You just sell that Brad's eight our lease. You sound like some delusional bitch. She could see it. Listen to me. You sound like a delusional bitch that goes to a massage parlor where they give out hand jobs and you didn't know it was a massage parlor where they give out hand jobs and you leave and you call the cops.

Speaker 4:          01:08:12       You're like, what the fuck? I just want a regular massage. I paid for rent. Where's my regular massage? She massages me for just like five minutes and she judge Jerky me off. Do you think every hotel will be like that? No. It's not every hotel, bro. It's the fuck hotel everybody else knew. We know now. Just like when you go to your hand job, I'm just saying if you were on Yelp and you type it in hotel, that thing has like three and a half stars. I didn't go, hey, that looks like a nice hotel. And they didn't have stars from people who work there. You didn't know it was planted. I didn't know it was a fucking sex hotel. Now I know now. Well, don't complain now. Give me my money back when they go somewhere else. No, no bitch. No. You had to learn. You had to pay to learn and now that you know if you're looking for that, if you ever looking for a hotel, do ecstasy and Viagara and just start fucking a bunch of random. Now you know the spot. You know the spot where people are getting their freak on. Just like if you go to a massage parlor and they rub your feet and then start sucking your Dick, you know that's a different kind of massage parlor.

Speaker 1:          01:09:12       All right? Don't be hating Brian. Fuck that

Speaker 4:          01:09:14       hotel. Don't give out the name. Even if Yelper if, if the people at Yelp are listening, please give me my Yelp elite status back. Don't give it to you. He's my friend and I'd say ignore his requests. Fuck you, dude. It's ridiculous, Hayden. Right? Don't you think he's say, that's total party. I would love to have seen [inaudible] Williams for Todd McCord. Mccord. You will ever see Joe turn around and go to another hotel. Yeah, because you can do, man, you just got to be willing to bite the bullet.

Speaker 1:          01:09:43       Chomp down. Yeah. Fuck that hotel in has in the ass. How rude, dude. That's all I have to say to you. How rude. She didn't call it a hotel. That's all I'm saying. Another guy we hung out with this weekend was a George sucralose, sucralose, sucralose, Giorgio sucralose, the guy from ancient aliens. Right. What a fascinating cat and do is awesome. He is great. We had a great fucking time, man. He was way cooler than I could've imagined. Both him and Anthony Bordain way cooler than, I couldn't imagine Giorgio came back stage with us. I don't want to say he smoked some weed.

Speaker 4:          01:10:18       We had a great fucking time. We hung out with me and that dude like

Speaker 1:          01:10:22       right away clicked instantly. You know, he makes some fantastical claims on that show, but you know when you talk to him in real life, he ain't married to anything. He's not married to any thought. You know, we discussed aliens, we discussed possibilities. He's like, it's just a possibility and there's another possible and there's nothing and he's not married to any of them and he's super cool and a really nice guy. He comes off, I liked him on the show. I liked that wacky. I would be like this wacky motherfucker. He's like saying all kinds of crazy shit. But sometimes he would annoy me. I'm going to be honest, like you said, like, like maybe Atlantis was a spaceship and took off. You know, maybe my Dick is a helicopter and I'll fly to Mars. Like, what the fuck are you talking about?

Speaker 4:          01:10:59       Maybe Santa Claus as a, but I don't have any evidence for it. Yeah, you

Speaker 1:          01:11:03       just completely dismiss it. It's nonsense, but it's a show, right? That's what he's doing. He's doing a TV show and when you're doing a TV show, look, you know, I could tell you right off the bat there's some shit that you say that kind of move the show along, you know, and there's some shit that you say may maybe what if maybe you want to hear something crazy. I'll give you some crazy shit. You want a sound bite and I'll give you a sound bite and maybe, and you know, you might not even believe that. Maybe what you say it anyway, but in real life, talking to him in real life, he's cool as fuck great hair to his fucking hair's all crazy. It's like some crazy peacock fan going on. He, she fucking owns it, dude. He owns it. He loves it. He has crazy beads on and shit.

Speaker 1:          01:11:37       Yeah, I did. Very nice jeans. I dig him. He's going to be on show July 27 this weekend. It's going to be me and mad flavor. Aka Joe Diaz at the Irvine Improv. That is a Friday, Saturday and Sunday. You dirty dirty Orange County bridges and uh, this is going to be a, it's almost sold out on Friday and Saturday already. And then Sunday is um, the 10th is the last day we're doing it. So it should be a lot of fun. You know, that's an awesome club. Irvine is a place, it's a great place to do stand up. I love that level. That whole area down there before yeah. Is Nice. It's like a nice little oasis of cool shit to do. Like a Ferris wheel. Is that one of the Ferris wheel? I think it has a Ferris wheel. There's the one with the first is in Irvine. Yeah. There was even a place out back to smoke out.

Speaker 1:          01:12:25       Yeah. We'll start with you got to have that if you're going to have a goddamn comedy show. Yeah. I got a little nervous that Anthony Bourdain was in the audience and I was worried if I was too high. I was like, how many hits I have? I had three heads. Shit, I'm skiing right now. Cause when you have three heads you got it. For as long as I know that I've gone over my material and I know that I've been performing a lot and I know that I'm in the groove, I can just go out there and ski. And by skiing means you never watched those videos where a dude gets dropped on top of a mountain on the helicopter and then do a lot of cocaine and then he's going down that mountain and it's some uncharted territory and you know this guy fucking hits a rock the wrong way.

Speaker 1:          01:13:02       He's done right. This guy's coming back behind. Yeah, the avalanche behind them and you know, there's no way he can stop. He cannot control this. He's going way too fast. That's how you feel when you get three hits in. They kind of know what the fuck you're doing. When you go on stage that hot you gotta be prepared. But fortunately I was, fortunately I was completely comfortable in, in the groove. These comedy shows have gotten 80% better in the last year and a half. And it's because of the podcast. It's 100% because of the podcast. I asked people on stage, how many guys listen to the podcast? The place went fucking crazy. It was all of them. It was all 1500 people that were there that it's, it's nuts man. They're all polite and friendly. It's like he used to be like, you have to battle just to get ground on stage.

Speaker 1:          01:13:46       And now when Joey and Ari and Doug Benson one onstage, all three of them got huge rounds of applause. Like everybody was psyched to see Ari there was psyched to see Joey there was psyched to see Doug. It's a just an amazing thing now. It's so different. Even in huge to that place is so huge. That's where the lion king is like usually this huge fucking show is usually there and now it's good. I know we packed it just talking. It's ridiculous. Comedy is a strange thing, but the, it's still my favorite thing to watch, man. You know, I thought about staying an extra day. I was going to stay until Sunday cause bill burr and Jim Norton and Jim Breuer and Dave Attell are all doing a show together at the palm and up for a minute. I was thinking, why don't I, you know, fly out Mrs Rogan for the day and we'll go to see a comedy show.

Speaker 1:          01:14:33       Like maybe she would be into that. And I'm like, can we get the fuck home? You know, I changed my mind but I do love stand up so much that I almost stayed an extra day to watch this show because I went out to dinner Saturday night with Jim Norton and Bill Burr and uh, my friend Justin from the actual report and Russell Peters were there too. And so we're all sitting around and Kenny, you know, clubs would have county. We're all sitting around shooting the shit. And they were telling me about Jim brewers new bit. Jim Breuer apparently has some clothes or that is just insane about him. His Dad taking a ship and they were all talking about like how this, this thing builds up like his dad shit in the car. His Dad's like an older guy and apparently it's the funniest fucking better one bed time. And they were, and I was like [inaudible] know. Right, right. Yeah. Okay. Vegan called that.

Speaker 1:          01:15:17       I know he's doing well. He did. He did. He did well in front of large audiences. Ice House Thursday, Brian went on in front of a, I mean one of the first times ever got him to do comedy. All right, this is, this has got, you know, this took Matt balls. This was way before the podcast. The audience was all meat heads. It was a UFC audience in Atlanta and it was a midnight show. So it was a midnight fucking show. And Brian goes on in the middle of the fucking show and kills you. You and you pulled yourself out of the fire because you started bombing and then you pulled yourself out of the fire and then at the end you ended like really strong. And that was the first time he did comedy and like years and years. Six years. Really? Yeah. But then I've thrown them up a bunch of times and I'm throwing them up in Austin, Texas in front of sold out crowds.

Speaker 1:          01:16:02       And you know it's interesting like your, your introduction to comedy is 1000% different than the average person's introductions cheat codes. It's traded on two ways. One because everybody knows who you are before you can go on stage. Cause then you'll get from the podcast now and they know you from all of the videos that you've made. You know, if you ever watched the Carlos men see a video, that was Brian's work and all, there's all these videos called death squad videos are all Brian's work. And so they already know who you are and you're an open mic or basically, you know, you're just starting out and yet they still know who you are and they're all clapping and cheering to watch you practice out your new jokes.

Speaker 3:          01:16:34       Yeah, it kind of sucks cause I, there's more, a little bit more pressure because now people know who I am and now I'm getting thrown up in front of sold out show is I actually have to act somewhat. Like I fit in, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:16:45       you just do it. Just be relaxed. You a smoked some weed before you go on to that idea. I found Brian has to, uh, you, you could go and, and I'm not dissing you in any way. I'm just being honest. You could go and work with a coach who would help you learn how to speak.

Speaker 3:          01:17:01       I figured it out. It's, it's got 100% marijuana. It, I, it does not work for me. When I get stoned, my brain goes, no, I can still, my brain goes overdrive. I'm thinking a thousand things at once. Like I'm almost like

Speaker 1:          01:17:12       trying to figure out, you know, you don't need to learn how to manage it with your mouth. Yeah. But when I'm on stage, my, like my memories everywhere, you know, you just got to do it more. Go Do it 20 or 30 times and get over that and then it'll kick.

Speaker 3:          01:17:27       Okay. I found, but I just found that, you know, I'd rather not, I'd rather just go out with like a drink in me

Speaker 1:          01:17:34       and I'm good. No, try to get me to go on stage. What about six years ago and I chickened out. He checked it out. I tried to get everybody to do it. Smart. I think someone's smart. I'm like, look, if you're smart, you can figure it out. Comedy, if you're smart, you're nice, and you make your friends laugh, you could figure it out. Colony, it ain't easy, but God damn, if you could do it, it's the greatest job in the history of the world. I, I'm constantly trying to recruit people to try stand up comedy. I ran into some fucking 17 year old kid in Vegas. I've talked to him for 20 minutes because him and his friend were thinking about doing standup comedy and they're asking me for advice and I said, all right, I'm not doing anything. I'll, I'll tell you everything I know.

Speaker 1:          01:18:05       You know, this is what you gotta do. You gotta write like fucking crazy. You've got to go up every time you can and you got to listen to your own shit. Go back and listen to recordings. Be Honest. If a bid is bombing, try it differently. And if it, you eventually you're gonna have to give up on that bitch and move on. Constantly keep writing. Like we went on this long thing, I go put yourself in positions where, you know, some weird shit might go down. That's a good way to write material. Like you've got to think that way. You gotta be a professional party animal, you know, for real, like the, the greatest comics ever. The Richard Pryor's and Sam Kinison, they were out there getting shit done. All right. It wasn't just going on stage and talk and they were living a crazy life too.

Speaker 1:          01:18:35       That's part of the program to, I don't, it doesn't mean abusive. It doesn't mean what they did, but it means, you know, try shit out. So fucking on the 15 at 200 miles an hour and getting a head on. Yeah. I mean, that's why I needed to, Colorado was one of the reasons besides wanting to get away, I knew that I was gonna get some material out of that. Like you've got to do things like that. So I, I, I'm a fucking huge supporter, standup comedy. I tried to get everybody to do it. I tried to get taped to do it. I got you to do it while you're done it before. But I got, you know, I've gotten a couple of people to do what I've got to Eddie Bravo to do it. It's just nobody sticks with it.

Speaker 3:          01:19:05       That was the big thing is, is that it's definitely, I think something you have to start when you're younger and you have to make that year career and I think all these people that you had try it. Yeah. They had their own thing going and they were doing it as for fun on the side. Kind of like what I do. But they're not, they don't want that as a job because it cause that's really risky to do it. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:19:22       Well, you're 36 hours to do it. We were all young, you know. Fuck. Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:19:31       Have you ever driven a home from Vegas and see night that abandoned water slide. Amusement side of the, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:19:37       Oh, what the hell was the, uh, it's creepy. Like Dolores, that's what it was. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:19:42       We were going to break into it and just like walk around with some cameras and stuff on the way home. But we are, the traffic was so bad so we decided not to. So if there's this Wikipedia page all about it and it's so amazing the history of that amusement park, like in the fifties and sixties this businessman bought it and he just put this water slide amusement park in the middle of the Mojave desert I think it is or something like that in the middle of the desert and there's this huge waterpark knows fifties themes. It was like very like fifties

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       music and sixties music and stuff like that. And it just, you know, it was millions of dollars in the,

Speaker 5:          01:20:14       I remember in like the late seventies and eighties all the time on TV you would see like Dolores commercials and stuff, but the, you know, you know, they would say it's time I 15 but they didn't tell you is three fucking hours from here. So

Speaker 4:          01:20:28       [inaudible] bought it and renamed it things every 10 years it would close and then be closed for like five years. And somebody else would read by and try for a year and then we'd go bankrupt and now somebody else is just a, just bought it again is trying it again. And they have like this whole youtube page and website all about them, like restoring it and stuff like that. It is the dumbest idea ever. Like people are fucking retarded.

Speaker 5:          01:20:49       Going to go through the middle of a desert to go to, you know, see what the, I guess for them, like they're planning on that business. When you have the, the occasional car accident, it shuts down the whole fuck, right. Let's go to the water bar, stock car accidents and they're all in the lay down some fucking nails trips. Oh Man. Let me now share on Memorial Day weekend out in Vegas. And it's like, it was like 1214 hours getting across that four hours. Anyway, man, it sucked, man. 14 hours. Really? It was, it was five, 10 miles an hour most of the way.

Speaker 4:          01:21:23       Imagine if you had a clutch. Oh God. Oh God. That took me six hours yesterday driving a standard kind of traffic. We'll drive you fucking insane. Yeah. Six hours. Don't fucking drive. Ever. Never expanded that she went back. You got caught going back. I'm going back. I didn't think about going there. You went easy, right? Easy. Three hours and 15 minutes and fucking amazing. Super fast. Way Back. We stayed an extra day so I could do a set at the nightly show and, and then um, I didn't think about it. I'm like, wait, everyone has Monday off. So they're probably going to have probably have to work Tuesday so everybody's going to be traveling back Monday. So I picked the worst data ever drive back from Vegas. It was only [inaudible] you go to a flight. Yeah, absolutely. And that's leaving 9:00 AM to, I mean I left fucking early. Wow. 9:00 AM six hours. Yeah. You gotta go like four in the morning. You gotta just stay up there. Just got to take those five hour energy drinks. Jenna Hayes did that to a like that one. I'm just slightly less than what you get with it. Stroke, just less than a strokes dose and then just ride that bitch just right when you started twitching. That's what all night foot to the fucking floor looking out for coyotes, both human and otherwise. Right. That's a creepy fucking stretch of road man. Those, that's boulevard

Speaker 5:          01:22:44       you. They were supposed to put a bullet train out there like 10 years ago.

Speaker 4:          01:22:47       I think it never did. And I think they're still doing it from, isn't it from Santa Monica to Vegas or something like that. You have to come up long dollars to make that happen.

Speaker 5:          01:22:55       Okay. Do you know, and it's such a long highway, you know it's been, it's been, what, two lanes since the fricking sixties yeah. It's ridiculous that the road is ridiculous this, but you know what, there was no one's going to

Speaker 1:          01:23:05       do anything different because the airline industry doesn't want anybody driving. You know, the airline industry wants everybody, you know, flying as much as possible. And then what, who's going to spend the money to Wa is Vegas going to spend the money that you've talking about a lot of fucking money problems. Nobody else is going to want to like why would we do that? How about you figure it out in your own fuck face and sure. California has casinos as well. Yeah. It's probably put a dampener on the whole, but they don't really have casinos. I mean, they do and they don't, you know, it's, they're not full casinos. You can't do everything at the casinos. You can't play slots and blackjack and poker. You know what I mean? It's like you have like little restrictions like this one. You can only do this. There's these, you don't let to play cards. Casino. Yeah. You might know this. I had a lot of people have been telling me this lately that the medical marijuana in Vegas, you can use your California license and they accept it. The California license in Vegas do that in a couple different states. Really? Yeah. They told me they do that in Denver as well.

Speaker 5:          01:23:56       No, no. That's the first I heard. Yeah. Todd Todd or Chris Conrad would

Speaker 1:          01:24:01       be open, I guess. Yeah, you would have to a, it would be different things state by state, you know, but they, oh, they took it when we were in a Vancouver. Yeah. When Vancouver they accepted our California recommendations.

Speaker 5:          01:24:13       You need one in Vancouver because last time I was up there there was blunt brothers and stuff. You could just,

Speaker 1:          01:24:18       you'll be seeing smoke British Columbia, not Vancouver, Washington. No. Yeah, you did. There was um, there was a pharmacies, now they have dispensaries in Vancouver. BC. Rice. Yeah. They're setting it up just like California. But California has at the, we're at the front. Oh yeah. The front of mine. There's nowhere will like this anywhere on the planet. I don't know.

Speaker 5:          01:24:36       Well, you know, and uh, right now Amsterdam was shutting everything down. So guess where all that business is going to start coming? It's, see there's going to be here. It's going to be Vancouver.

Speaker 1:          01:24:43       You see the fuck is Amsterdam thinking that was the dumbest shit ever. You guys are known for weed and you're going

Speaker 5:          01:24:48       and that's, and it's been legal for what, 35 years or something and now they're going to shut it down to only residents. What the hell, you know? Yeah. What does that, what it is too many people tripping and fucking, I mean, you'll get like 10 but see how many people do dumb shit on alcohol every night. Alcohol is by far the worst drug out there in every study ever done. But when you have, you know Frank's house and there's people showrooming like Dunkin donuts every Sunday, every couple of people that dove off a bridge and committed suicide on mushrooms and Amsterdam. And it's like, you know how many fricking people do that shit at night on alcohol and, and, and, you know, Holland alone. Well, so scared. It's like, oh my God, they would have done it anyway.

Speaker 1:          01:25:28       It's way easier to a band things than it is to make things legal. And we make it very easy to write things off and decide that, you know, like there's people, right?

Speaker 5:          01:25:40       Behavior, oh my God. People without any studies

Speaker 1:          01:25:43       whatsoever. They're trying to outlaw Salvia, you know, and they're, they're pulling it off in, in various states and making it illegal. And there's no research behind any of this. They're just pulling.

Speaker 5:          01:25:51       Oh yeah. And all this stuff is scare tactics. You know, it's like this kid did, you know, a couple of years ago, there was this big scare back east. This kid had done salvia several months before, wrote in his diary that he could see how half the shit in his life was complete bullshit. He was starting to see through the big fucking lie out there. And then they said, you know, months later they tried to say, oh, well he committed suicide because of Salvia, even though he was not on Salvia and he had done it months before, you know, it's, it's that he, you know, he certainly started seeing how a lot of what the media and government and things like that tell you is bullshit until they come up with a suicide. It's like saying, you know, Lsd, you know, somebody waking up from LSD like a Timothy leary and then years later they commit suicide.

Speaker 5:          01:26:37       Oh, it's because it was because of the LSD. Okay. But you can clearly make some sort of a connection between some of those kids that got experimented on in Harvard, like Ted Kaczynski and his behavior afterwards. We'll sure there is a connection between really. Yeah. You know, I would love to know what trips, what they did to him. I would really like to know what they did to Ted Kaczynski. The unibomber. Ted Kaczynski was a part of the Harvard LSD studies and he was, he was a professor of math up at Berkeley. This was no dumb shit. This was a top scholar. Yeah. He just completely lost his marbles. Presumably during these LSD experiments. Maybe they expose something. Maybe they, uh, they broke. So what's that documentary called about him? That's a good question. I don't remember. Oh, shoot. Is that, I've seen it. Yeah. Yeah. I forget. Just look up, look up a unibomber documentary. I'm, I'm sure you'll find it, but it's a, yeah, it's, it's about something with the computer industry as well, I think. Yes,

Speaker 6:          01:27:33       yes. Well, you know, he, uh, it's really fascinating what he did when, when is it? No, that's a new one. When your brother was the Unabomber, the net than that. Exactly. That's it. Um, he, uh, he saved up all his money after these studies and worked, uh, as a professor of mathematics at Berkeley. And when he was working there, he was just studying and saving up his money and trying to figure out what the fuck he was going to do when he moved to the woods and how he was going to tactics.

Speaker 5:          01:27:59       Yeah. You know, I would love to know who was in charge of the study that he was in. Was it Dick Alpert? Was it Tim leary?

Speaker 6:          01:28:07       What he did was absolutely horrible. You know, and what he did for sure, that guy should go to jail for it for sure. He was absolutely insane for sure. He was homicidal. But the thought behind what he was saying was that technology is eventually going to kill us.

Speaker 5:          01:28:20       Right. Well, yeah, we need to stop. Well, basically what he was arguing was that they're using the technology to enslave everybody and to dumb us down and to control everything. And he was trying to stop it because he started being the math professor at Berkeley started seeing how the whole system worked and he wanted to shut it down. Right. I mean, well, the way he did it was nice and saying, you know what kills a bunch. Yeah, he, Oh fuck people's lives up. You know, he's, he went about it. You know, he didn't use critical thinking. Properly run is an analysis of his solution, but there's something to what he sang. The idea that technology eventually is going to overtake us. It's absolutely, I mean it's discussed in depth by thousands of scientists and futurists and the rate Kurt's and my grandfather, your grandfather talks about that shit and hates technology so that it's overtaking us.

Speaker 5:          01:29:06       Just to say that all the time. Well, I think anybody at our grandfather's, an older guy grew up in a time where there was no phones and no nothing. We put out a documentary last November called, uh, what you've been missing in episode one of the noble lie, which goes into this whole use of technology to dumb us down. So anybody wants to check that out. Look it up. I think it's a silly argument. I don't think, I don't think it dumbs us down. I think there are dumber people than ever. It's because life has become easy for them. It's easy to become dumb or checkout and checkout the how they're, they're doing it. They're using the BF Skinner's ideas from the Skinner box and how they controlled animals and things like that. Uh, there's a lot of Edward Bernays was talking about, what are you talking about? Well, Skinner, the Skinner box is a box that they would put a pigeons and rats and things like that and get them to do certain things for food or whatever on a stimuli.

Speaker 5:          01:29:56       And they've learned to apply that stuff directly to computer games and to, uh, you know, purchasing and the grocery stores and things like things like that. But what checkouts checkout checkout, it's, you know, it's an hour and a half long documentary. Just, you know, what you've been missing. Episode one, check it out sometimes what you've been missing episode one and it did. Okay. And they can, they can go to the gnostic media website and click on the videos thing there and it'll be right there. Okay. Okay. And the, what is the conclusion? Well that there are certain people using marketing and advertising and computer technology, uh, to specifically to mind control people. And it's very, very simple to do. Is it mind control? It's mine. It's mine controlled at, at face value when, once you see how it works, it's just, it's real blade. Do you accept the argument though that marketing is mind control and they're getting people obsessed?

Speaker 5:          01:30:49       Socio Jack? See the thing how mind control works is, you know, I mentioned this trivium thing earlier by people not having the trivium. That's what enables marketing and public relations, the polyp political system, the last system that we have today, that's what enables it to work. That stuff wouldn't be able to function. That's why it doesn't work on any intelligent person. And He, no intelligent person watches any nonsense propaganda on television and buys it immediately because you've accumulated a certain amount, like you know, say if you go out and you study logical fallacies for 20 minutes and then you go study commercials, you'll see how every commercial is filled with logical fallacies. So once you can identify those logical fallacies, you begin to see how they're using these lies against you everywhere. And then you just block them out. What's the end game though? And like, well, the end game is just to learn your own, your own gain, your own autonomy, your own adulthood.

Speaker 5:          01:31:44       Really it's to see through the crap and gain yourself back. It is important though, to enjoy life, right? It is important to do this and to figure out how to enjoy life. Don't you think? Oh, I definitely see here, let me, let me put it to you this way. And in ancient Roman times, they considered those who had studied the seven liberal arts is free and those who didn't were slaves. The slaves were not allowed to study the seven liberal arts, this trivium or quadrivium thing. As soon as you got free of slavery, that was the first thing you did was undertake a study of the seven liberal arts, right? So let's say nobody in our society in the masses even has that education now. So we would be considered in Roman times the slave class. Okay? So when you see the word freedom, literally, uh, which is what the word liberal is, is from the Latin word book.

Speaker 5:          01:32:34       Liebherr and so Liebherr and uh, library liberty, these are really on me Bro, isn't this, this is what we'll hold on that horizon. This is where it calls out. This is where freedom comes from. So when people learn this stuff, this is how they got free. So you know, it's the difference of knowing that you're a slave free from, totally agree with you on this. We're basically, this is a very complicated way of saying that our education system sucks and it could possibly be set up that way on purpose. Don't dumb your audience down too much, Bro. It's not dumbing them down. Kind of fill in the voids here. I'm trying to bring this show back to life. The idea is that good. And at one point in time, uh, people were, were taught this stuff on a regular basis and now our education system is no longer a pizza, been completely removed from people's education.

Speaker 5:          01:33:21       Does that really is on purpose? Do you think that's it? Oh yeah, there's evidence that it was done on purpose. We don't, and in fact, I just saw an article by this woman Kelly from Canada free press yesterday talking about, uh, the American, uh, freedom or the American rebellion, uh, from England was originally centered around the trivium and classical education. Okay. So when people are in a school today, you know, when, when they come up with some sort of a, a little lesson plan for the year, is there someone who's actually saying, hey, we don't want these people smarter. Let's like dumb shit down and you can see if you happening. Whereas if people want evidence of that, they can study Charlotte is or beats book. Do you believe this Brian now and as well, I would suggest people study two people, primarily John Taylor Gatto and he's written a very good book.

Speaker 5:          01:34:08       The America, the underground history of underground history of American education for people that read and also Charlotte is or beats book the dumbing down of America, which she also has a lot of primary documents in her book on the Reese Commission and how they dictate stuff. Check it out before you dismiss it. Let's say those two names. Now they're under more time. You're freaking people. The fuck out people on Twitter right now is saying this is the most name drops anyone has ever had in the podcast. Please fucking write this shit somewhere. I'm freaking out because John Taylor, Gatto and Charlotte is, or B, these are the last people's books we're going to tell people to read because otherwise we're going to look like God damn. University studies go. We'll just go onto my website. I've got a video up on Gatto right on my website. They can look at it. They're okay. They'll do that. Now you, you, how long have you been into this? This, this studying of psychedelic chemicals and you know, the between,

Speaker 6:          01:34:58       you know, these, uh, these things and religions and you, you've been in this for a long ass time, but how did you ever get into it to the point where this is how you make a living?

Speaker 5:          01:35:07       Well, let's see. I've been in it at least 20, 22 years or so, but, uh, originally I got in at working with Jack Herer on the California health initiative and he was the one who originally turned me on to a John Allegro, his book, the sacred mushroom in the cross. And, uh, I, you know, how did you feel like when you first discovered this stuff? But I thought, Jack, the bat shit crazy when he first told me about it. The same when you, when you met us and you thought we were completely crazy.

Speaker 6:          01:35:33       I didn't think he was crazy. I thought, first of all, I'd been exposed to a bunch of things that I never would have thought it existed before by that time. So I was already open to the possibility, like, who the fuck knows? I'm pretty ignorant as to the way the universe really operates. You know, just started reading about quantum physics and you know what I mean? Like you start reading about things in super position where a particle is moving and not moving and in one place and another at the same time. And like what the fuck is real and what's not and what does the Observer, so when then some guy tells you that he thinks that mushrooms, you know, probably shaped religion. That's not even crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:36:06       Where'd you meet Jack and I? A grateful dead concert or at school actually, my sister turned me onto his book when I was probably 18 and then I had met him at a hemp rally and December, 2002 I went to his house and we instantly hit it off and we were friends for 18 years and I was one of the people that help bury him in April last year.

Speaker 6:          01:36:25       Because you, you know, on your show for sure, you preach to the converted, you know, and you have a, a really, uh, a big following of people who like me are kind of pretty well versed in this subject matter and, and understand a lot about, you know, psychedelic drugs and, and you know, the, the relationship they've had to humanity for thousands and thousands of years. But what about the average person once you run into like some regular square dude and he,

Speaker 5:          01:36:51       so what do you, first of all, he's got to get by your name. Jaan yeah, it looks like Jan to me cause it's way he spells it Scandinavian, right? Yeah, he's only English pronounces Jay is just so it's more like you're yawning like, oh, well, you know, you have Johann or, or something like that. Viking blood in your past. I'm primarily a Danish, Welsh and Scottish and he viking in there. Any of those? Possibly. Who knows who's a viking? What was it? What was it? Norway. Yeah, the Norris. Norris. The North men. Right. Okay. So no viking. Eric. Hmm.

Speaker 6:          01:37:28       But now, but what is squares do when you, you meet some regular dude like in your neck of the woods and your small town that you live in and he's like, so what are your right about there? Yeah. Oh well

Speaker 5:          01:37:35       I don't, you know, it's interesting. I usually don't even talk about it in my neck of the woods. I'm usually so busy with work and doing my show and you know, it takes me two hours to answer all the emails and I hear from people all the time to see my work online and Holy Shit, I just saw your work and it completely blew me away. But you know, I very rarely have people that come to me and just say, oh, that's

Speaker 6:          01:37:56       completely bat shit crazy. How often do you communicate about what you do to someone who is completely uninitiated? It's, what I'm trying to say is, I have had some conversations before and uh, one of them I had on a plane with a doctor and he was a very intelligent guy and uh, we, we sat down and you know, he was just being real friendly and started off with like fear factor questions and then somebody

Speaker 5:          01:38:16       start off, you know, with, with ancient primary sources and things like that because you know, a doctor's gonna want to cut straight to the facts. No bullshit. So just give him the primary text says, listen, listen iconography,

Speaker 6:          01:38:29       listen dude, it's a social situation. You're having a drink with a guy on a plane, you know, breaking things down for them. You just talking, shooting the shit. And we broached the subject of first marijuana and then he was asking you about that book, Dmt, the spirit molecule that was sitting on my table. You just mentioned another boat. So you have this guy where you're talking to him. So he's an intelligent guy that's like 50 years old that has no experience whatsoever in anything psychedelic. And when I started describing the experience and I started talking about it, then he started getting interested and then he started talking to me about it. And then he started writing things down and he started like taking little notes on it and things that he wanted to investigate. And he asked me, you know, like where it could get the book, you know, it was it on a website. Can I get it on Amazon?

Speaker 5:          01:39:10       You know, somebody for something that might be easier for a guy like that would be like Dr Roland Griffiths work.

Speaker 6:          01:39:16       Oh, he's fucking name dropping again. This con Roland Griffiths.

Speaker 5:          01:39:21       Look sorry. Is his study silicide been a religious experience and that was, that was all over the news a couple of years ago. The most recent one. Yeah. It's very recent stuff.

Speaker 6:          01:39:32       Psilocybin and religious experience. And what's this dude's name again? Roland Griffiths. You know, it's, I mean, how many fucking more books can come out about it before they start teaching it in mainstream mainstream?

Speaker 5:          01:39:43       Well, you know what's interesting is, is, uh, in December, Loma Linda University Medical Center, which is a seventh Adventist, uh, medical school. And it's considered one of the best in the world. They had me come in and like a Mormon seven days. No, it's not Mormons, but seventh day Adventists. They're seventh day Adventists while there is a Christian group. But uh, anyway, they worship on Saturday and Sunday instead of Saturday. The worship on the sabbath basically. So, uh, this, this school had me come into their pharmacy department and give a two hour lecture on the history of the medical and spiritual applications of psychedelic drugs.

Speaker 6:          01:40:19       Whoa. What was that like? Did you get a lot of hippie chicks to have the show Montana? I want to get a piece of that author. We just have, I have so many thoughts that was so similar to yours. Real freaky. You must get through. Fortunately the,

Speaker 5:          01:40:36       the class was those who were allowed to participate where the top of the class, so they couldn't, uh, you know, there were, there were no, anybody who thought that they thought was going to deviate from the norm of society were even allowed to attend the lecture. Sure.

Speaker 6:          01:40:48       Wow. Huh. Do you get psychedelic groupies? Do you get girls who are like

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       interested because they're like really? And decided that Alex, there's their colors. Yeah. There's been some your arms. He has a beautiful Arra got the same sign as me. I see you in your documentary.

Speaker 5:          01:41:06       How this connection, the farmer credit inquisition. I was never in the documentary, but they can see me in the one that you and I were in American drug war.

Speaker 1:          01:41:14       Yeah. That was a long ass time ago. Right. Did they wind up using your, your footage in that?

Speaker 5:          01:41:21       Yeah, they use like 15 seconds or 30 seconds or something of it. It's um, and then, uh, Kevin Booth, he was going to use a lot more of that later on, but I guess never went back to it.

Speaker 1:          01:41:30       It's w what I was saying is what I was trying to address by asking you what it's like when you talked to her regular people that don't have any experience in this. It's a, it's a very weird subject to broach all of it. The, the, the, the use of psychedelic drugs as anything more than a party favor.

Speaker 5:          01:41:44       But you know what's interesting is his last April up in San Jose, there's a group called maps, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. They hold a huge conference. It was the first one in like 35 or 40 years, but there was eight or 900 doctors and professors there at this conference. And the whole thing was about the latest research and psychedelics. And it's a regular basis, right? This is, uh, there, there, well they, they are planning, there are different ones, but this was the first and the largest is a national one instead of regionals I would have is, well this one was, it was the largest where they, it was like spread out over three days, uh, almost a hundred presenters. You know, literally people come flying in from all over the world, medical professionals from all over the world, experts in psychedelics presenting on just everything. So, I mean, you know, the, the, the, the psychedelic craze and fear of the 60s is pretty much a over and it's becoming a lot more in tune with the academic side and with real knowledge about psychedelics instead of just the fear that was put out by the, the mass media for the last 40 years.

Speaker 5:          01:42:49       So you really think there's a shift, you really think that things are actually changing? Oh, yeah. Well, because it was a recent, just in the last six or eight months, I think maybe it was, uh, October last year, uh, uh, ecstasy, Mtma was approved for treating PTSD and military professionals and a, there's pilot studies pilot treatment studies happening in, uh, in Colorado. Right. And how often is that happening now or? Well, it's actually giving Mtma to people that Israel is using it. Uh, there's a, a couple of other different places that are already using it for the treatment of Ptsd. Uh, right. But is that actually happening in America? Yes, it's happening in Colorado right now. It's already been approved for use. And, uh, the one thing that's approved for use in almost every other country in the world is he boga from the Ibogaine in the treatment of alcoholism and heroin and opium addiction. And that's got like a 92% success rate. But unfortunately the United States is one of the only countries in the world where we're drug addiction treatment is illegal with, uh, with Ibogaine. And a Iowasca is also been shown to be very effective in the treatment of, of alcoholism and opiate addiction. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:43:59       Yeah. We're held captive what we're held captive by corrupt politicians. Oh, sure, sure. Yeah. You know, from special interest groups and, and that's what's wrong with it. Right?

Speaker 5:          01:44:08       Yeah. I don't want to drop any names that people can, if people are, if there's any addicts out there that want more information, contact me through my wedding.

Speaker 1:          01:44:15       You can find Ibogaine research places in Mexico where they have, I'm sure

Speaker 5:          01:44:19       Canada or pretty much anywhere in Europe.

Speaker 1:          01:44:22       I didn't know they haven't been Canada, but I know a buddy who was gone to Mexico several times to do it and he said that it's changed his entire life, changed the way it looks at everything, and they made him see himself for who he really is and abandoned all those false patterns of behavior that he had gotten stuck with and all the false connections that he had made in his mind that we're constantly tripping them up.

Speaker 5:          01:44:39       Yeah. Ibogaine actually blocks the, the opiates ability to trigger those receptors in your body. So you come down from this 12 or 24 hour trip and you are literally not addicted anymore. It cuts that addiction off and now and at the same time it's like a, you know the, in Aa when you have to have the life review it, it forces that life review in that long trip. So it not only do you get the life review, but at the end of the trip it blocks you from being addicted anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:45:08       It's like it's designed to cure you of any wrong. A dense, yeah. And it's an extremely powerful psychedelic. It's been used by the weedy and Africa for thousands of years and yet it's illegal and it's illegal. The US passed in the 1970 classification that, that whole ruling that made all those different psychedelic drugs, was it just lumped into there as I might say, I'm sure it probably was. What's amazing is the ones that didn't get lumped in there and they didn't know about like five methoxy DMT, the most

Speaker 5:          01:45:36       full psychedelic on earth. And there is a church operating in the United States called Toad Tuya de, uh, that operates using a five methoxy and dimethyl trip

Speaker 1:          01:45:46       domains. And this may or may not have happened. It might be fiction, but a long time ago, maybe me and yon did some of that shit. Maybe, uh, maybe we learned a lot and we paid him. He bought it online. Maybe we bought it online easy. Don't do DMT with Eddie Bravo.

Speaker 4:          01:46:06       Yeah, Eddie is, he's grown as a man since then, although now he's wearing me with his love for bunnies can ever happen to it. Channeling. He's ready to have a child. And so now he's like really into bunnies. And the loving, loving, small things. In fact that Eddie Bravo can make me almost cry now is amazing about a bunny. No, like just when we had him on that last podcast, they was just stick the most on his sign and everything. I was like damn, this is a softer side of Sears. Yeah. And then he shut down on us in the conversation. It was like just fucking ended it hit a wall and just dropped off. And then Eddie Saturday with a sad face and Brian was half asleep. So I'm like, Hey, is anybody out there like that fucking show with the guys on the radio trying to talk to past sheet.

Speaker 1:          01:46:51       Remember? Oh it was in the movie contact. Remember she was trying to call her saddest moment of all time. The little girl was trying to call her dad. Yeah, she almost got to him. She couldn't get the medicine to them. That was pretty solid. So what am I was trying to get at is do, do you ever have any interaction with regular people who just think you're fucking crazy for studying this stuff? You turn off, do you turn off? Occasionally you'll have the person who's never looked at any of the research or evidence call up when I'll do a radio interview view or something all freaked out about it. But you know, they're telling people to do drugs and I think what you're doing, it's raw. Yeah, you've got, you know, I mean, you should be manage. Me and Johnny Rotten gave you DMT and look what happened after that, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:47:34       Yeah, yeah. Johnny rotten was on the podcast once we talked about it, about psychedelic trembling changes the whole world. Because if you go through that and you, uh, your world doesn't change, well then man, you must have known something already. You must have already, I mean, it must be the smartest person in the world. How could you not improve radically multistate consciousness theory. Mckenna had the best description of it and his, his description was that he looked at your culture as an operating system and he said that there is only one way to a band in this operating system. You have to take something, a program that, that, that sort of reprograms your operating system and you could do it and he hadn't, you know, name out all these different psychedelic compounds and he said, or you could do it in DMT form, which is like a compressed, you know, 15 minute for him.

Speaker 1:          01:48:23       You know, it's like taking Shannon's shut file, you know, and, and uh, unzipping and into your hard drive, just boom, you got to change two terabytes of new information that flying in. It was not something that everybody should do. I think some people have a hard time with regular life. I think some people have a hard time with just a fucking getting through life and it could be a whole host of things wrong with them. That's largely because of societal conditioning in an, in the first place. So, so gets caught in this catch 22 loop. It could be medical, it could be a lot of other things. There's some people that have issues that like just holding on to regular reality. So I'm not suggesting that everybody do it, but I'm suggesting that we should be able to go places and try it. If you're a fucking regular person and you've got your shit together and you know and you, you're, you're curious about expanding your mind and your consciousness with these experiences, there should be a place where we could go where the government fucking make sure this stuff is pure, they get taxes from it.

Speaker 1:          01:49:18       Everybody profits and the society profits because you're going to have better though man. I mean it really needs to go back to just being free. You know, it should, okay that would be nice, but why not have it where you can make money off of it and it actually is a contributing member to society. Okay. Because let's go back selling it, giving people the gold coins and shit and making, hey man, here's a basket. Can I have some eggs? You know what I mean? Like we can go back to bartering things, but in the meantime we need God damn government. You know we need, you know what I'm saying? I don't know. I'm not sure about that. There is a committee, the government out there, there is

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       a myth of government, some structure. We need to be able to call the cops. We need someone who's going to fucking fix the roads. Roads. We need some shit. They say we don't help. The problem is is when they say we don't need any organization is kind of silly. Well you have to say, I don't want to give a name call out here, but please don't check this 300 million people. Man. You need to go to my podcast and check out this show called the myth of government that I did a few weeks ago. Okay, let's talk about farts. No, no. Shut up Brian. Shut up. I just a, I think you know Brian's got to keep it as shallow as possible. Yeah, that's what he's here for.

Speaker 5:          01:50:26       Real. Let's not get deep at all. Let's, we got pretty deep dude. That's deeper than most people. We can't get scholarly. We can't, we can't go drop into a thousand names. It's just too confusing for all the stoners and are in their car right now called. I'm trying to fucking absorb this man. But the books names are important. So the number one book from John Marco Allegro is called the sacred mushroom and across, and that is the one we talked about earlier and Jay Yawns two books that he's published are, what was the, uh, the mushroom one, the Holy Holy Mushrooms, the most recent one. And then the one before that is astro theology in shamanism. Christianity's pagan roots. And that one's really interesting too because there's so many cool photographs in it and you can just really see, yeah, they both have a lot of photos. Keller, nobody would have ever believed that shit was real.

Speaker 5:          01:51:09       Nobody. Will you just looking at those photos and be like, are these mate, I think making this up? Like how could this be written? And most of them we pulled from ancient library archives, Biblical archives and stuff. Are you going to put them in digital form and any of these books? Because I, I've, I've honestly caught my selfie. Bali mushroom book is available on kindle, but because astro theology and shamanism has like 185 color images and it, it was too hard to put it into a, a clean digital format like Kennel. So it's left in book only for

Speaker 6:          01:51:38       man. I feel like we should be able to do that in iPad form or you know, and I got a couple of copies. I'm yeah, iPads have that option now. I mean I, I've been watching, not watching but I say watching comic books on an iPad because it is like a watching a comic book if you've never seen it. Well you can get iPad has um, a bunch of different programs and one of them is for marvel comics and you buy comics and you can watch them frame by frame, you tap the frame, then it goes to the next frame and then, oh, it's fucking incredible man. It's incredible. And if they can do that with comic books and have these high resolution images for each one, I feel like they should be able to do that with your magazine or your, your book rather. Cause they, they do it with magazines to do with wired magazine. Yeah. This is, he's got the marvel comics one. See how it's set up

Speaker 5:          01:52:22       instead of you looking at Saturday, same people from pirating it, those, the thing a big, because what it does, it has to run inside of a program. So this comic alone, you can't just take out and look at it like got to, you got a keyboard in your little case studies. He bitched keyboard you sexy bitch. You know what you're doing. And it doesn't even seem much bigger than a regular iPad with keyboard is probably

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       the right size. Do you, are you considering taking that with you instead of a laptop? Yeah, I've been doing that lately. But you're living on the edge. It's only, I can't work relate too much. Like I can't run it podcasts on it. No disposable media on it. Right. You can't like connect anything is there a USB knows nothing. Right. And connect the USB to it when a hard drive or anything and you can't use it as a hard travel can store things on the desktop. Internet and games.

Speaker 5:          01:53:10       I like game boy and a new slate that's a full on computer. You can edit audio, do everything, all programs

Speaker 4:          01:53:17       desktop. Why couldn't you create a new file and put it on desktop? Can you do that? I mean it really depends on what you need to do. Like if you want to have like a document. Yes, there's a word program. There's Dropbox, there's you save them inside the the the IPAD. It'll allows you to save things. Yeah. It's got a 64 gig hard drive and really or whatever it is eventually. Do you think that's what's going to be going on? If that seems like a small laptop? I totally feel that. Let me feel that it's still kind of heavy. I tell you, Mac, Mac book, air, macbook air, they're about to release a new one. I think next week the new macbook airs are the way to go there. The price of the macbook air is now only a thousand dollars or less and and, and that they're having a new one that comes out next week that's, it uses this new memory that's going to be so much faster. Something like that. I mean for the majority, unless you're working heavy on the road, that right there is better than any iPad or tablet or anything skipped that wait for the new Mac. But most people just need to keep up with whatever technology is on websites. Right? Yeah. I mean absolutely. It's just, it's just basic work usually speaking to technology, aren't you the dude? Didn't you transcribe a gang of those? Uh, Terence Mckenna didn't. You

Speaker 5:          01:54:24       did. Right. Cause I remember when I first met you, you were talking about having those from Siemens can remembers for the last seven or eight years, right. Have you had to do damage control because you know as much as he had, right. There was a lot of pseudoscience bullshit in there to really misinformation. People have criticized him for a few things. What was the main thing that you think that you could talk about? The 10 well, 2012 first off, I mean now we know exactly where the whole theory came from, where they developed it. Basically, it originally started with a in search of, and then a hose Eric [inaudible] and Terence Mckenna picked up on it and they spread it until, you know, Daniel Pinchbeck made it famous based. So you're talking about the Mayan version of two, 2012 not even Terrence as TimeWave zero and all of that was launched by Mckenna and the in search of program with Leonard Nimoy and Shit. That was the, the the premier episode. So as your assertion,

Speaker 6:          01:55:16       if people are, people don't know this, Terence Mckenna came up with a thing called TimeWave zero novelty theory. Well, you know, Terrence, Terrence admitted that the knowledge, the theory was, hold on, hold on. It's a, it's a theory that just as for people who don't know what the fuck we're talking about, all right. It's a theory that supposedly can track waves and time. And the idea is that time is actually something that you can track with a program and that his program was based on the each ang and that it tracked novelty or innovation and inventions and, and, and great moments of change all throughout time. And that by applying this novelty program, this algorithm to the past, he could point out real big spikes in the curve. That was all bullshit.

Speaker 5:          01:55:56       Well, the problem was, and uh, there was a guy who came out and presented a paper called mathematical hallucinations, is Watson. Uh, I don't remember the guys,

Speaker 6:          01:56:05       the Watson, there was a, there was a guy named,

Speaker 5:          01:56:07       I remember it's in my ans book, but uh, came out with a paper mathematical hallucinations and basically showed that, you know, what Terrence did was arbitrarily place the, this, the end date. And there is no way really to match up perfectly. He just had to arbitrarily say December 21st, 2012 and if you look in, what was his other options, he could have said January 30th, 2013 he could sing, he could have said anything because in 1975, when the first edition of invisible landscape came out, you can look in the first edition and there is no, December 21st, 2012, it just says 2011 or 2012. It's in the 1993 edition when he and Jose are Gwas got together. And, and, and both decided on December, December 21st, 2012 date. But in fact, there is no, there is no even, there is no connection to the Mayan calendar there whatsoever.

Speaker 6:          01:57:00       Well, there wasn't supposed to be in my Mckenna Mckenna's defense. It took him 25 years to work on this thing

Speaker 5:          01:57:05       well out himself and admitted that it was wrong before his death. What was wrong about it? That because of the arbitrary placement, and there was a few flaws in the math that this guy had pointed out in the mathematical hallucinations paper that Mckenna, uh, stuck to his academic honesty and relinquished the theory. Well, this is, my theory has continued on.

Speaker 6:          01:57:28       I don't understand because you're saying that he lied. What you're basically saying is that he knew about that.

Speaker 5:          01:57:32       Well, I talked to, I talked to his brother about this, Dennis Mckenna, and he's been on my show and he and I have done a couple shows together as well on other places. But, uh, what he said was that basically the theory got so popular so quickly that Terrence basically just let it run the theory, the, the, the, the novelty and the end date that the entire theory is based on the appeal to novelty, which is a logical fallacy in and of itself.

Speaker 6:          01:58:00       What about the theory? I mean, what about the end day coinciding with the end of the long count of the Mayan calendar?

Speaker 5:          01:58:05       Well, there is no, see there's only one monument in that we know of its monuments six that even discusses December 21st, 2012 and the only thing that it says is that a king will be robed. That is it. Anything else that's applied about December 21st, 2012 beyond that has been made up and embellish. So it might be that prince dude from England just goes to get a new suit. I am betting my money on. So you know, so anybody who says that it's the end of the world, that they can trace this to the Mayan calendar, all of that stuff has made up. The only thing, the only that we have is a king

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       will be robed. Oh really? That's amazing. That's it. What about the end of the long count, isn't it the end of the long count?

Speaker 5:          01:58:49       December 31st and January 1st it's about, you know, that, you know, I mean there may be a planetary alignment, but you know, do the polls shift and does the end of the world happen and all of this stuff. I mean people, you know, wake up in the morning and get ready for work and you know, take a shower and all that shit like you usually do on December 20th

Speaker 1:          01:59:09       second pinch back says that we should be in the woods and we should make our own money. Right. Well, Daniel Pinchbeck charges $325 a ticket for 22 2012 conferences as well. He really, yeah. Really? Wow. What a genius. He asked me to do one in like Utah. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:59:26       Well go to you all the power to them. You know, I know professor John Hops, who's, uh, who's an expert in Maya's studies and he sent pinch back a whole bunch of information when he was writing that book, showing that pinch, his whole theory was completely bogus. You know, not only that, but Pinchbeck is using an Aztec God kits, a Quadel to tech talk about, uh, uh, Maya calendar. What is an Aztec God dealing with the Maya calendar and why would he come down and come to Daniel Pinchbeck this New Yorker, white guy to, you know, to reveal 2012 to the world, right? [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:00:01       wait a minute, wait a minute. You say, wait a minute. He actually says that this thing came down and revealed it to him. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:00:07       Quadel and Aztec, God came to him and told him about a Mayan calendar and the 2012 thing, the end of the community's needs. So, you know, I remember when I said about arguing the arbitrary or earlier when you don't have any evidence of anything, it's bullshit and you throw it out. Well, this is when you take, are arguing the arbitrary and you make a fucking shit load of money on. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          02:00:27       Okay. But this guy, he, I did not know that he did this. So he, I've met him before. He seemed like a very nice conversation with them out in my backyard. Well, are we talked about at the end of the world? I think that's what he rocks with what? I wanted to get them on the podcast, see if I can get them high and just dug about life, you know, find out what makes you tick, dude. Um, but, so you're saying that it's all bullshit. So you're saying that he's just,

Speaker 5:          02:00:49       there's no correlation to the Maya calendar and you're saying it like it says God Catsa Quadel was it a dream? That's the story is a trip or whatever. Right. Okay. And so, and so there's an Aztec God telling him about a Maya calendar. We're talking about two different cultures, two different religions, two different calendars.

Speaker 1:          02:01:07       The Maya didn't celebrate quests. It's like, it's like, you know, Jesus came to me in this vision and told me to teach the world about the Mayan calendar. Right. Same ridiculousness. The Mayans didn't study quinto Quarto or they didn't have a quite so Quadel

Speaker 5:          02:01:22       well, they have their own deities in their own college model. It's not, no, it's not called Catsa. Quadel. That's an asset. That's an asset. God.

Speaker 1:          02:01:31       Hmm. So that snake, the plumed serpent from the Maya, what is that? What's that called? Oh, let me see. Oh,

Speaker 6:          02:01:40       thank you. Right.

Speaker 5:          02:01:42       I don't, I'm not recalling the name off the top of my head. Okay, so you're basically saying pinch and shit though. Yes. Wow. Strong words. You heard a Pinchbeck. It's time to come on the podcast for counterpoint point. Counterpoint in there and have him address publicly. All of John Hubs is points that ups has been publishing the entire regions of 2012. He's published it three, uh, two times on my show, but he's also coming out with a book on the whole thing.

Speaker 6:          02:02:06       I watched a fascinating show on them trying to figure out how to decode Mayan language because what Mayan language, like each, each little symbol like will like you will say things like, you will see things like Mckenna described it. Like if you had an eyeball and a saw and an aunt insect and a rose, I saw aunt rose. That's how you would say I saw aunt rose. Right? You'd have to do it like that. Like it's, it's, it's incredibly difficult to decipher, but a fascinating documentary about these scientists and archeologists trying to break it down and figuring out what the fuck everything means and how long it took and all these breakthroughs that they can go wrong to all sorts of things that are being thrown. What's so difficult to decipher? It's like, and I was going to ask you this because I've seen, I saw this in a park and not a podcast, a documentary once, but I an Ari agreed that it's probably correct, but I haven't been able to break it down with anybody who really knows a lot about ancient, the ancient Bible and the ancient Hebrew Bible. The ancient Hebrew Bible, uh, was all, that was not the earliest version of the Bible. The earlier versions of the Bible where the sacred would, uh, was, was the Dead Sea Scrolls. Right?

Speaker 5:          02:03:16       Well, the Dead Sea scrolls were probably written from the second century BCE to about 67, 80. Original Torah would've been written, like genesis was probably written about five 86 BCE. So the Torah with, you know, certain aspects of the Torah, which we don't have an original copy that's that old, but, uh, would technically be older than certain sections of the Dead Sea Scrolls. But there is a lot of, you know, identical copies of, of, uh, original Hebrew texts in the Dead Sea Scrolls. And the Dead Sea scrolls were written in Aramaic. Right. Which they're written in Aramaic and it's on animal skins. Right. Uh, mostly most of it's on par parchment. Some of it was on a pirates. And then, uh, then there was the copper scroll as well, but there was someone animal skins. Yeah, most of it was parchment, which is lamb skin. Yeah. Oh, wow. That's what Parchman is. Right.

Speaker 6:          02:04:13       Wow. I thought it was a type of paper. I have no idea. Right. Wow. And so that was one of the things that I read that they were trying to match up different pieces of the Dead Sea Scrolls by using DNA so that the parchment came from the same cow matching the DNA of the fucking, the shit they were writing on. Try to figure out what pile this pile is. All this one animal. Let's figure out if this was the same scroll. Fucking incredible Mami. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          02:04:40       That is a, that is a brilliant idea.

Speaker 6:          02:04:43       Did you, um, have you ever seen this shit that's going on now in Turkey where they're unveiling that that temple that was, it was on the front page of a, of a life magazine recently or not in life? Um, so it's the yellow and national geographic. It's a go go Beckley Tepi that uh, it completely predates by a huge chunk. Anything that they thought people were doing 12,000 years ago or earlier. It's um, you know, the earliest known human civilizations, Mesopotamia. It's like Babylon in Iraq.

Speaker 5:          02:05:12       Interesting. No, I recall hearing something about it, but I haven't studied.

Speaker 6:          02:05:16       They found this is these temples in Turkey and there they've been, uh, unearthing I'm there trying to like decipher them and figure out what the fuck it is. This is back when they thought people were nothing but straight hunter gatherers just roaming around like animals.

Speaker 5:          02:05:27       Well we're, we're finding out more and more often that civilization is probably 10 or 15,000 years older than most previously believed.

Speaker 6:          02:05:37       And a lot of those early civilizations, they had evidence of cattle worship and evidence of psychedelic mushrooms.

Speaker 5:          02:05:43       Marsha, right? Cows and mushrooms go hand in hand. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:05:46       Like that one. Um, one of the earliest ones. What was it? Um, uh, God, chuck, how do you say I'd Tuck Tuck Holyoke.

Speaker 5:          02:05:55       Yeah, I know what you're and cut the line or whatever. However you say it looks weird when it's written it down. Right?

Speaker 6:          02:06:00       But it's all cows and shit. They're worshiping counts. I guess you would worship cast cause they keep you alive because they eat them and that

Speaker 5:          02:06:06       and then they poop. And then these, these things that give you religious, uh, inspiration come out of the poop.

Speaker 6:          02:06:11       Yeah. That's the amazing part of it is that most likely that's responsible for why Hindus are so fascinated by cows and they love it.

Speaker 5:          02:06:18       Oh, sure. And don't want to ever even take that into consideration. Now, you know, and there's more than a hundred a hundred psychedelic psychoactive plants dedicated to Shiva alone. Yeah. But, uh, you know, the Hindus still use bang or bond, which is marijuana and Soma was argued by Gordon Wasson to be a am Anita miscarried, the red and white spotted mushroom that you see in all the fairy tales and note with gnomes and dwarves and, and Mario brothers and shit like that. And there's so much ancient Hindu art. It shows people holding up mushrooms, mushrooms and mushrooms coming out of their heads and all this stuff. You know, just like we've got for, for ancient Christian, uh, uh, artwork. There's a lot of that stuff out there.

Speaker 6:          02:06:57       It's amazing that you have to hear about this from the podcast of a comedian. You know, you know, hearing about this on CNN, they won't discuss this. They wouldn't allow you to come on and have a two hour uncensored conversation about the origin. No kidding. Yeah, it's, it's, it's a weird world that we live in, man. It's a weird world that we have this incredible access to information, but yet we're still filtered or filtered pretty fucking heavily. It starting to change though. They're really starting to change.

Speaker 5:          02:07:24       It blows me away too. How many academics and researchers are out there all over the world and universities working on this stuff and there's academics all over the place that know about it. But, uh, you know, the mainstream public is completely unaware of it

Speaker 6:          02:07:38       for the longest time, for any academic using even the term psychedelics as a subject of serious research, you know, you got all, I'm looking into psychedelics, so what the fuck are you wasting your career on, man? You know,

Speaker 5:          02:07:51       the leary and the, the bad connotation that he left a psychedelics. Yes. Yeah. But you know, it's interesting that time life or that Time magazine actually had more influence and popularizing LSD then Tim leary had in time, life was being run by skull and bones.

Speaker 6:          02:08:08       Huh? What did, how did time life have more? Just the stories? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:08:12       Well, the Henry Luce who is the president of timeline, if he, you know, he's even his wife, Clare Booth Luce is even closed. Quoted as saying that she and her husband had more to do with popularizing LSD then Tim leary ever did on purpose. Oh yeah. Wow. There they had done it and they were, they were, they were in on the, on it from the top,

Speaker 6:          02:08:32       but Timothy leary was the spokesperson because he was a guy like, holy shit, this guy's a harder, he was the one that they

Speaker 5:          02:08:37       put up front as the spokesperson. He was the one that Kinda just went hog wild with it.

Speaker 6:          02:08:42       Was he responsible in any way for the Ted Kaczynski thing?

Speaker 5:          02:08:46       That's an interesting question. I would have to go to a were Ted Kaczynski is locked up and

Speaker 6:          02:08:52       ask him myself, you know? Yeah. That would be an interesting guy to do an interview with. Right. People wouldn't be angry. You know, it's like when someone's killed a member of your family, you don't want that person being glorified as you know. Perhaps I misunderstood the fuck happened. And who, who gave you the LSD? What was behind the program? Let's think. Let's get down to the meat. Tell us what really happened there. Isn't it incredible that he really is like a true, I mean it's possible. We don't know whether or not that's what caused him, but it's possible. It's a very strong possibility that he really has some real Manchurian candidate Kennedy type of a dude. He really is something guy that they, you know, they, they did some shit to him. Not as my AdvaMed is that, you know what? I think he might've been more brilliant than that. But yeah, I don't, I mean the idea that someone could be changed and then become a killer, you know, and that literally it can be done not in miniature and candidate was like he was, what did they, you have to come up to him and say something to him and he fucking snaps or some silliness like that. But I think the, in the case of Kandinsky that they might have fried disguise circuit point. This is the, but I don't think it was planned.

Speaker 5:          02:09:58       Did all the unibomber shit 20 or 25 years after these LSD experiments. You know, he was a really, oh yeah. You know that those experiments were in the what, the 50s or 60s and a, he was professor of math up until mid nineties up at Berkeley.

Speaker 6:          02:10:13       Really? So when, um, didn't need what? I thought it was only a professor for a few years, but I don't think so. Check double check me. Do it. Pretty sure I do a wiki search. In fact, check me shit. This is going to take too much time, but let's just say then just the net is a very fascinating documentary. If you want to watch it, it is a from another country, I'm not sure which show. It's all in subtitles. And you know, there's another

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       really good documentary that people should check out is called the crazy rulers of the world. It's a that they, the, the movie the Hollywood movie men who stare at goats is based off of the film. Crazy rulers of the world. Check out that one and the net back to back. It'll give you some really interesting insights. Information on us. Intelligence and psychedelics do is too much information out there and I don't want some of it in my head yonder oven. I don't touch shit. Let you get into it then. Don't you think though that a certain point in time it's like God dammit. You're like, no, no, no. But I'm saying dig so deep into the rabbit hole and he's like, fuck, I can never like live a real life. Now I'm always looking for a skull and crossbones and secret societies and fucking anybody can look in an old dictionary and see that uh, the Illuminati in skull and bones and shit is real.

Speaker 5:          02:11:25       I mean pull up, pull out, uh, a 1911 dictionary and that Shit's right there. Nobody disputes. Oh, sure. I hear people. Oh, the Illuminati conspiracy. But that's shit. It's totally approved. That's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is it has ever get to a point in time where you're just like, you're, you're so absorbed in all the shit that you can enjoy regular life. Not really. I mean I, I'm fascinated by this research. That's why I do it in the first place. It's a passion. Right. And wouldn't do it if I wasn't fascinated by it. Yeah. And it's, but you're, your research is all like exposing all kinds of crazy shit that the government is up to. I mean, it's like founding the founding father of the whole field of psychedelics was the chairman for the council on Foreign Relations. I mean, when that shit goes public out there in our field, it's going to be explosive.

Speaker 5:          02:12:12       I mean, you know, that's taking away their guy who was the founding father, but I can show that he, he stole many of his ideas from this other researcher who came 70 years before him and the 1890s. And uh, but you know, there's a whole big there. You know, there's, there's scandal on top of scandal on top of intelligence, CIA bullshit. And does it ever get to a point where you're like overwhelmed by this shit when you just want to just take a deep breath? Do you have your phone shit on silly boy, you know, every once in a while. Sure. But, uh, you know, usually when I get into and find all the more crazy shit, it's like, Aha, here's another book. Write another book for you to write or to read or to write. Oh, well, okay. In that sense, man, it totally makes sense.

Speaker 5:          02:12:54       What, what the fuck can be done in closing? What can be done? How can, how can people, um, do something about this situation that we're in, that's been here since you and I were children and that he is here now that we have the best, the best thing that people can do, in my opinion, that is the real solution is pick up the trivium pickup critical thinking, grammar, logic and rhetoric. That is the best way. It's like installing a mental antivirus system into your brain so that you know, suddenly it's like taking the red pill. All of a sudden the green lines are coming down the screen. You see, you got to write a book about this. Um, we've, we've talked about it. A friend of mine is already writing a book on it. We've done a number of documentaries on the trivia run trivium education.com website that people can check out and run this. I run that website. Yeah. So people can check that out. There's, there's videos and stuff up there that people can check out on it. But I would say that that's the most important thing because once you have that, you can see all the other bullshit going on it teeth, you know you, it doesn't teach you what to think. It teaches you how to think and how to see through all that

Speaker 6:          02:13:51       bullshit. That's nice for the people that are going to pay attention, but what kind of a strategy, if any, is possible for letting people know about psychedelics, letting people know about the benefits and positives of these things that have really been held back from people. One of the things that Mckenna said that always stuck with me is that living a life and going birth to the grave with like without psychedelics to me is like living a life and going birth to the grave without ever having sex.

Speaker 5:          02:14:17       I would agree with that, but the problem with just doing psychedelics with how critical thinking is that when somebody breaks free of their religious paradigm or the new age paradigms that are just as much mine control out there as anything else. The problem is, is if they do psychedelics alone, they're easily manipulated. And so I disagree with, with Mckenna and Larry's theory that everybody should just take it. I think that people should be given the proper tools of critical thinking and then take the psychedelics and then they really break free.

Speaker 6:          02:14:47       Basically we have to start our own cult slash educational center.

Speaker 5:          02:14:51       Oh, we don't need it. When do we need to do, that's the nice thing about the trivium is that it prevents people from buying into religious creek.

Speaker 6:          02:14:57       Clearly not serious, but if we had it called, where would we rock this shit salt and see Brian Canoga Park Canoga Park. It's really close by. It'd be much more convenient. There's no lesson exposing people to this information is probably step one. There's a bunch of people that are growing up now that are in high school and college that are reading these types of books and listening to these types of conversations that we're having on this podcast and researching this type of information. And uh, just having this stuff, being a part of public discourse, it allows people to know it's out there. And it allows people to start thinking about things and a little bit of a different way, you know, we're all programmed in one way or another, whether we like it or not, you know, we're programmed by our experiences were programmed by our environment and um, it's not always necessarily for your own good to follow that fucking programming. Right. Indeed. And so Jaan thank you very much for coming on the show and thank you for your books man. And thank you for republishing the Sacred Mushroom that cross. And if people want to buy your books, they're all available on amazon.com right? Uh, yes, there is that where it, is there some hippy fucking thing about Amazon? Am I supposed to avoid it?

Speaker 5:          02:16:02       No, actually, but if you, if you do buy it directly from the gnostic media websites, a Amazon takes less of our cuts. So get it from me ever sponsored, you know, all of the research and work is sponsored by the public.

Speaker 6:          02:16:14       So this a Friday, Saturday and Sunday we will be at the Irvine Improv. Tomorrow we're going to have an early podcasts, a noon one with none. Only the Duncan Trussell. Um, so upcoming in the future. I'm still trying to work out this Anthony Bordain thing. Don't block who mark Marin's

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       step bitch. And uh, I'm also going to work out a sucralose and we're trying to get dice clay to dice. Clay said he would do it too, but yeah. All right, Holler at your boy. I'll see you guys tomorrow at noon and thank you very much and I love you bitches. And did Joe Rogan experience podcast is sponsored by the flesh lie.
