Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience is that you and Rodney dangerfield. Did you double as Rodney? I did double hip a few times, but movie was this. Oh God. A couple of TV shows I had. It was a picture of you guys up there. What's that? Dad? Can you say? Uh, yeah, he, uh, yeah, we, I was doing sword fighting then sword fighting. Oh yeah, definitely him. And uh, he was quite a character, quite a character. He would always leave his pants zipped and um, so I had uh, one of the actors say, Hey, his pants, he'd go up and he says I'm getting air conditioning. Don't bother me. And he just did it as a square of a joke. Right. With like the robes and stuff is like balls. And I've talked about this before, but I worked at Great Woods, Concert Center in Mansfield, Massachusetts when I was a kid. I was a, amongst the security personnel there.

Speaker 1:          00:55          And so I was backstage and I got to see Rodney as he was preparing for a show. He would just have a robot and nothing else. He was wearing slippers and he had a robot. And he was walking around back there, this is before I'd ever done standup comedy, but I was like, that guy is the shit. Like, look at him. He's just, he's literally as comfortable as you can get. He's wearing a bathrobe on purpose and it's because he could, you know, he was like, [inaudible], I can whatever. I'm just gonna wear a bathrobe. It's comfortable. I like the way I love the way he does it because he can because he keeps fucking. Rodney did. He knew he was Rodney dangerfield. He never said anything and he played it straight and apparently a super nice guy, like everybody I know that did business with them or had any interactions with them, always came away from it.

Speaker 1:          01:40          Same Rodney. He's a great guy. My friend Jeff, my manager, Jeff, he was with one of, uh, one of his clients was one of Rodney's original comics on the Hbo Comedy Series that he did. And he said that Rodney was just the best. Just the coolest, nicest guy. But it happens all the time. I know. But what's worse than that are fucking your sister having sex with your sister. That's worth, I think the victim. There were consistent. Wants it. You want it? I thought about that. There's one. I will go to my grave saying I've never had sex with my sister. That's a good move. Yeah. There's some things you want to keep off the resume. That would be. Well, you don't even want to do it and then go, well that was a mistake. Never do that again because you can't really erase it. Just kind of fucked man.

Speaker 1:          02:25          Because like isn't like learning like one of the most important parts of life. Like shouldn't you be allowed to fuck up? But you can't. There's certain fuck ups you can't make. Like you can't be like, you know a baby. I want to marry you. I want to marry you too. But I gotta tell you this one thing I know, I know this is not going to change anything because we're meant to be with each other, but I fucked my cousin. Your wife's going to be like, what? Why don't you fuck your cousin? Wait a minute. Which cousin? Guy, how far? Wait, wait, Whoa, whoa. I fucked my cousin Mike. How far was the, is it a first cousin or is it a uh, yeah, it'd to be a first cousin. Was your second cousin? That's it's gay sex. Um, I think no one's going to be happy with you, you know, if your wife's not happy that you fucked your cousin.

Speaker 1:          03:08          But this is the, that was a joke brody. But if it's straight trash, my aunt antlers. If it's straight, it's straight sex. I think I'm the second cousin is actually like legal, like you can not only fuck them, you can marry them, right? Yeah. Lewis first cousin. Can I ask you a question? Not, you're not supposed to. It's been on my mind and I know you probably don't want to talk about it because it was brought. Oh well thanks for bringing it up on the Internet. What was brought up in it? Well, I'm just being real. Who's brought up in you? I think you were uneasy with it. It was an ice house. Chronical. I'm. Why would you bring it up again? Because I heard Joe talked about gay sex. Like I have to make it clear. I'm not into that. Oh, why do you have to make that clear?

Speaker 1:          03:54          Because I get hassled for it. Sometimes it goes back to you again. Brody notice, well, going back to him and gay sex. Apparently you can have sex with your cousin. It's legal. What of your cousins? A transsexual than a. it's even more legal. Depends if you're a. If you're telling someone who writes for Salon, you're in a few girls that have been attracted to their cousins, but they always use the excuse. They're not blood related and they've well done. Yeah, that's not real. I wouldn't have sex with a relative. Just not into it, but I think people have done it throughout history. I think it's kind of sick. Why you don't see them that often? I just think it's sick day. I think incest is a sickening thing and I'm sorry it's happened to some young girls or kids or whatever. I mean it would've been thing. What if it's a cousin that you really enjoy? I think a cousin is too close, but what of it? Look what if that cousin is the perfect person for you? What if you know it does. It doesn't make sense, but you know what the heart wants, what it wants brody and then one that's not normal. And so if you look at the way we treat [inaudible], why the fuck would we ever expect anybody to

Speaker 2:          05:03          be nice to us? I used to exercise the analogy of um, of aliens with the younger trainers all the time. I'd say, look, we're aliens to these animals. You need to make this animal's environment as comfortable as possible. Bearing in mind always we are aliens. Just, you know what I mean? That's part of relating to the animals which is or thing like that. You're just like, wait a second, like I got to start being nicer because if an alien comes down, I don't want that. I don't want. It

Speaker 1:          05:30          sounds like it's a stupid thing to say like it's one of those who's your target. Again, people like automatically go goofy with it. But the reality is it's actually, it's the right analogy because we really are aliens in the world and we're obviously supposedly intelligent. We're obviously intelligent enough to figure out how to get them. We're intelligent enough to figure out how to train them, put them in tents, put them in tanks rather. Have all these people come to see him. We're obviously intelligent. Have to film them. They

Speaker 2:          05:58          can tell there's a lot of shit going on that they don't do, but they've got to be like, God, you guys are dicks. Like, why are you holding onto me? Like we don't. Hold on. We don't. We don't, we don't do that. I think we killed things, but we don't hold onto them. I think that's when the frustration level start boiling for these animals because when they're first, when they first arrived here as a green animal, if there. I mean the bottom line is it depends if they're a good candidate for captivity, but they learned real fast that, okay, that's the hand that feeds me. Like I wanna I wanna I want to develop this relationship if you will, which is an relationship of abiding by this person's race. Right? So and again, goodwill, the animals and the other ones that are just like, this ain't for me. They're, they're, they're, they're cutting out and there's nothing you can do. I mean, you pull blood from them, you check that blood. There's nothing wrong with them. This animal's not sick. Why isn't it eating? And then days later, why is this animal dead did not want to be in captivity. They just starve themselves to death. I've seen it so many times. Wow. The will to live loss.
