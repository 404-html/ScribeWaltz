Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience, is that you and Rodney Dangerfield? Did you double as Rodney? I did double Hib a few times. What movie was this? Oh God, a couple of TV shows I had. This is a picture of you guys up there. What's that guide? Can you say it? Ah, yeah, yeah, we, I was doing sword fighting then sword fighting. Oh yeah, definitely him. And uh, he was quite a character, quite a character. He would always leave his pants zip. And um, I had, uh, one of the actors in them. I'm saying, Hey, his pants inside zip. He'd go up and he says, I'm getting air conditioning. Don't bother me. And he just did it as a swerve, a joke. He wants to write with like the robes and stuff. [inaudible] like balls and why? I've talked about this before, but I worked at Great Woods, Concert Center and Mansfield, Massachusetts.

Speaker 1:          00:52          When I was a kid, I was a, amongst the security personnel there. And so I was backstage and I got to see Rodney as he was preparing for a show. He would just have a robe on and nothing else. And we were wearing slippers and he had a robe on and he was walking around back there. This is before I'd ever done standup comedy, but I was like, that guy is the shit. Like, look at him. He's just, he's literally as comfortable as you can get. He's wearing a bathrobe on purpose and it's because he could, you know, he was like, cause I can whatever, I'm just gonna wear a bathrobe. It's comfortable. I liked the way, I love the way he does it because he can, because he keeps fucking Ronnie did. He knew he was Rodney dangerfield. Hell, he didn't have any said anything and he played it straight.

Speaker 1:          01:32          And apparently a super nice guy. Like everybody I know that did business with them or had any interactions with them, always came away from it. Same Rodney, he's a great guy. My friend Jeff, my manager Jeff, he was with, uh, one of, uh, one of his clients was one of Rodney's original, um, uh, comics on the Hbo Comedy Series that he did. And uh, he said that Rodney was just the best, just the coolest, nicest guy. But it happens all the time. I know. But what's worse than that are fucking your sister having sex with your sister. That's worse. I think so. I victim there. Where's your sister wants it? You want it? I thought about that. There's one I will go to my grave saying I've never had sexual my sister. That's a good move. Yeah, there's some things you want to keep off the resume. Yeah, that would be, well you don't even want to do it and then go while I was a mistake.

Speaker 1:          02:20          Never do that again cause you can't really erase it. Which is kind of fucked man. Because like isn't it like learning like one of the most important parts of life? Like shouldn't you be allowed to fuck up but you can't. There's certain fuck ups you can't make. Like you can't be like, you know a baby. I want to marry you, I want to marry you too. But I gotta tell you this one thing I don't, I know this is not going to change anything cause we're meant to be with each other, but I fucked my cousin. Your wife's going to be like, what? Why did you fuck your cousin? Wait a minute. Which cousin? Guy. How far, wait, wait, whoa. I fucked my cousin Mike. Huh? How far was the, is it a first cousin or is it uh, uh, yeah, it'd be, have to be a first guy then it was a second cousin.

Speaker 1:          03:01          Well if it's gay sex, um, I think no one's going to be happy with you. You know your wife's not happy that you fucked your cousin. But it, this is the, that was a joke brody. But if it's a straight ranch, my aunt works. If it's straight it's straight sex. I think. Um, the second cousin is actually like legal. Like you can not only fuck them, you can marry him, right? Yeah. First cousin. Can I ask you a question? Joel? You're not, you're not supposed to. It's been on my mind and I know you probably don't want to talk about it cause it was broad. Oh well thanks for bringing it up on the Internet. What was brought up? Well I'm just being real. Who's brought up in, not you. I think you are uneasy with it. It was an ice house chronical. Um, why would you bring it up again?

Speaker 1:          03:47          Well, cause I heard Joe talked about gay sex. Like I have to make it clear. I'm not into that. Oh, why do you have to make that clear? Because I get hassled for it. Sometimes it goes back to you again, brody notice, well it's going back to him and gay sex. Apparently you can have sex with your cousin. It's legal. What else of your cousins? A transsexual then? Uh, it's even more legal. Depends if you're, if you're telling someone who writes for salon, you're in a few girls that have been attracted to their cousins, but they always use the excuse. They're not blood related and they've all done. Yeah, that's not real. I wouldn't have sex with a relative, just not into it. But I think people who have done it throughout history, I think it's kind of sick. Why would, if you don't see them that often?

Speaker 1:          04:33          I just sick. It's sick. I think incest is a sickening thing and I'm sorry it's happened to some young girls or kids or whatever. Made it would if it's a really good name thing. What if it's a cousin that you really enjoy? I think it cousin is too close. But what if it look, what if that cousin is the perfect person for you? What did you know it does. It doesn't make sense. But you know what the heart wants what it wants, Brodie and then one good and that's not normal. And so if you look at the way we treat orchids, why the fuck would we ever expect anybody to

Speaker 2:          05:03          be nice to us? I used to exercise the analogy of um, of aliens with the younger trainers all the time. I'd say, look, we're aliens to these animals. You need to make this animal's environment as comfortable as possible. Bearing in mind always we are aliens. Just, you know what I mean? That's part of relating to the animals, which is, are thinking like that. You're just like, wait a second. Like I got it. Start being nicer because if an alien comes down, I don't want that. I don't want to be sounds as, it's a stupid thing to say.

Speaker 1:          05:32          It's one of those, are you talking about aliens? Again, people like automatically go goofy with it, but the reality is it's actually, it's the right analogy because we really are aliens in their world and we're obviously supposedly intelligent where obviously intelligent enough to figure out how to get them when intelligent enough to figure out how to train them, put them in tents, put them in tanks, rather have all these people come to see him. We're obviously intelligent enough to film them. Theirs, they

Speaker 2:          05:58          can tell there's a lot of shit going on that they don't do, but they've gotta be like, God, you guys are decks. Like, why are you holding on to me? Like we don't hold on it. We don't. We don't. We don't. We don't do that. I think we kill things, but we don't hold onto them. I think that's when the frustration levels started boiling for these animals. Cause when they're first there, when they first arrived, he has a green animal if there, I mean the bottom line is, it depends if they're a good candidate for captivity, but they've learned real fast that, okay, that's the hand that feeds me. Like I wanna, I wanna I want to develop this relationship, if you will, which is in relationship of like abiding by this person's, right, right. So then again, goodwill, the animals and the other ones that are just like the same for me. There, they're there, they're cutting out and there's nothing you can do. I mean, you pull blood from them, you checked up blood. There's nothing wrong with them. This animal's not sick. Why isn't it eating? And then days later, why is the Sanama debt did not want to be in captivity. They just starve themselves to death. I've seen it so many times. Wow. The will to live Lawson.

Speaker 3:          06:56          Okay.
