Speaker 1:          00:00:03       We're good. We're live art. What does that echo thing going on anymore? We'd killed that were good. Nick, how are you buddy? Pretty good. Well thank you. So you've got this hat on. Nick. Curse on that. I'm saying not last name. Curtis in Carson. Yeah, like Chris and have you. You train a Hofeld Osan. Joe's a Russell on providing the cough and you've got his hat on roofs. Salons hat on. It says what does it say again? Ratzy bowler hats and in Russian I believe that translates to something like young warrior or young fighter, something like that. That's funny because I ran into a couple of Russians the other day and asked them if they knew what it meant and they didn't even know. They just need. The last part was fighter and they didn't know that the first apartment. So I don't know. That guy is a character providing the crops.

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       One of my favorite fighters to watch because he can't be in a boring fight. He doesn't have it at him. I mean that guy fights like the most exciting style of fighting inboxing to that. It just comes at you. You know, he's just an animal. Unfortunately. He takes a little too much punishment though. Yeah. Well he's almost too brave. Yeah. You know, almost two brave in too tough, but fucking not fight with Matisa. Oh my God. That was insane. Oh my God. That was what everybody was hoping. Floyd Mayweather. It would be made with a pack. Yeah, that's what everybody was hoping it would be. I was like, you know, you guys are out of your mind. You don't know what you're about to watch. You guys are spending millions of dollars. It's going to be like the biggest gate ever. And what you're going to watch is a floyd mayweather exhibition on movement and Jabbing and straight rights lead. Right? Hands clench. Get out of the way. I mean, that's what you're going to say. That's, that's exactly what it was. But providing a cough. God, how do you think the guys feel the, uh, tuned into the child's junior fight that night and miss the Monica? They were silly.

Speaker 1:          00:01:55       I watched both. I mean, that's the beautiful thing about dvrs Chavez Jr. Looks like he's phoning it in. Yeah. He just does not. Look like the same guy like daddy wouldn't when he was younger and much more exciting and just looked, looked like a real promising future champion. He just doesn't, doesn't have the volume anymore. Doesn't look like he's in shape. Fighting much heavier, right? Yeah. I'm a tsa and providing a cup fight with something else. So you're a strength and conditioning coach. And one of the reasons whY I wanted to call you and here is because I am absolutely fascinated by the marina bitches, right? The guys who taught you a lot of what you know. And um, I'm also fascinated by just tHe boundaries of human potential when it comes to strength and conditioning because as, as an analyst, as a guy who sits there and watch his fights and I've seen, I don't even know how many fights would have probably professionally called several thousand fights at this point.

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       I don't even know how many it's been really. It's been at least 1500 or something of the best fights ever. Right. And you start seeing things over and over and over again. And occasionally there's these outliers and these outliers are guys who just have way more gas than anybody else. Guys who have way more ability to push deep into the fourth and fifth rounds and you just wonder, like how much of what we're seeing in terms of what a fighter can do inside the octagon or inside the ring, how much of it is, how much endurance they have. And I maintain that. It's a significant amount. AbsoLutely. I think it's, I think it's everything. It might be 90 percent of it or something like that at least because it seems like everybody is pretty skillful once they get to the upper levels of the ufc when you're dealing with a pedes or a dose on joe's or all, all across the board.

Speaker 1:          00:03:48       When you, when you hit those high level guys, they're all very skillful and some are better at certain aspects of fighting than other. But it seems like the ones who can win and win the way, the way pedis and dos just went down the way. Dos anjos just dominated paddocks, right? You have to have a fucking insane gas tank. Absolutely. Um, I don't know if you've see my instagram and seeing some of the videos I did. Oh yeah, yeah. I'm, I'm a fascinated by it. So yeah. Rafael, when he first came to me, this was after the [inaudible] fight. He'd tried several other strength and conditioning coaches as we came to me about two or three workouts in. He's like, wow, this is already amazing. I feel the difference. And that's when I began to assess like, like a longterm plan. So like when I first get a new athlete, I don't just look at the immediate fight, I look where I want, I want them to be about a year from now, six months from now and three or four fights from that, whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:04:39       But I kind of knew like some things that were holding him back and areas that weren't trained properly that we needed to rectify. What do you see when you, when you start working out with a guy, like how do you, how do you first of all realize it? you know, what I'd like to do, like this is something that the marinovich has did with bj penn was the first thing they did was they got a heart rate monitor on them, so, and then they put them through sparring to find out what areas tax them the most and then that's what they would kind of designed the camp towards. So if wrestling taxes you the most, so that's the energy system we need to train the most for you. So, you know, like with bj, he never had any problem with his longterm arabic. It was always as anaerobic energy systems.

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       So it was always sprinting. Exactly. The big burst, short burst and long bursts. So entire amount. The issue was the recovery from short burst. Absolutely. And uh, yeah, exactly. So if, if your, if your anaerobic systems aren't chain properly, you won't get that recovery in between the burst and some guys will go their entire career without ever correcting that. And you're always exactly in this weird limbo state where you're scared to push it too hard. Right? Exactly. Now you take a guy like hoffeld dos anjos that has beaten donald cerrone. So when he came to you, who's already world class one of the best fighters in the division, I think it was ranked 10th when I started with

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       him. So he's a good fighter. And that time we began training for the roost. Um, he was scheduled to fight roost on copy of exactly and we did a pretty much a full training camp. We did six weeks of training and then colby law pulled out I think two weeks prior to the fight with a hurt finger or something. And so, so then we had a break for about three weeks in between and then he got the news that he's gonna fight khabib. So he did another full training camp and prior to the cubby fight I actually left for weeks before the fight. So we stopped strength and conditioning for weeks. So he missed the complete peak to peak fanny, a peak training phase of the, of the conditioning program. And I think that's one of the reasons why you lost that. Partially. Yeah. I feel a little bit of a responsibility for that.

Speaker 2:          00:06:43       Sure. But, uh, also you have to admit habib number grumet off is a fucking monster. He is. He's a monster. He's a, he's a good fighter. uh, I think, and I hate to make excuses, but I think if people understood like what referral went through before that fight, they would be a little more accepting of the fact that he might kick khabib's ass next time they fight. You know, a lot of people are already saying kebabs. A new champion I did roughly almost had his fricking eye gouged out. THe whites of his eyes like this was during the training camp. So he had to take another couple of weeks off in the middle of the training camp. The whites of his eyes were literally hanging down from guys fingernails where he though they're sparring, they got poked his finger nails into his eyes and the whites of the eyes were, were stripped of it were hanging down below his eyelid.

Speaker 2:          00:07:28       Oh god. Yeah. And then so what they do to fix that, I guess they just trimmed it off and yeah, I just turned it off. And then let. Yeah, wait a minute. You could trim the whites of your eye level. Apparently. God, yeah. Rafael is a monster. Like people don't understand is because the guy had fingernails. Fingernails. Exactly. And there's farming and he went to push them back or something. Two fingers went right into his eye and know, you know, obviously he's not going to put that out there on the internet and show people, hey, look at my fucked up. I or she should not. Have you seen his ear? I don't know if you saw the picture of his ear recent. Uh, no. This is the same thing leading up to the khabib fight. Prior to that, his ear was ripped off in the cage. So it got stuck in between. A couple of the links have seen that picture and his ear was hanging on by a thread. It is jesus christ. So this is all going on during training camp. Wow. One thing after the other. And then I leave for weeks out.

Speaker 2:          00:08:33       Not to mention he switched to a vegan diet. What's? Yeah, for that fight. Why did he do that? I have no idea who told, told him to do that. No idea. Do you have any response? I just ate vegan lunch by the way. So talking shit. I eat a lot of vegan food. I talk a lot of shit about vegans, but my, my, my diet consists mostly of vegan meals and murdered animals are combined those two. That's pretty

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       interesting. I just, I feel like you can't get. It's very difficult to get everything you need from just vegetables, but I feel like you really can't eat enough vegetables. I think vegetables are super important for you. I think that it's one of the main issues that people suffer from when it comes to health anD nutrition. even a lot of vegan people, they too much breads and pastas and rice and things along those lines. And I think you need a lot of vegetables. I think it's super important for it to change is the way I think and feel.

Speaker 2:          00:09:25       Have you ever tried to supplement called dim? What is it? Dim? No, what is it? What does this diane doll me thinking? Hmm. And it's supposedly like a concentration all the cruciferous vegetables, but it helps lower like estrogen levels. Scott phytoestrogen. So it helps. It helps your body metabolize estrogen. And I tell you what, it actually works. It gives you gnarly gas, but it works.

Speaker 3:          00:09:50       I don't know if I'm willing to make that trade off. I did. It's worth it. Take it on an empty stomach. Back room. Yeah. Jesus. Crazily. Yeah. Don't tell certain people that I know that. Not blowing Farts on folks. The other night my fiance and my baby woke me up. He was laughing or that, that poop? No, it was very funny. So, so who talked a dos anjos into going vegan?

Speaker 2:          00:10:22       Uh, you know, I don't know to be honest. I don't remember. I think he just kinda something he wanted to try and his own and, and, and if you notice in that fight he looks quite a bit smaller too. Like his shoulders look smaller and he looks

Speaker 3:          00:10:32       loss of muscle mass. Well, you know, there's some health benefits to eating a lot of vegetables. I just don't, I don't think there's enough evidence to promote veganism. I just don't think it's worth the. I think the, the tradeoff is too significant and I think your body, I mean we're omnivores, it's just the way it is and especially when you're dealing with high level athletes that are blowing down a lot of muscle tissue on a regular basis. So a lot of recovery that needs to be done. If you're just a regular person going through life without any significant stress on your body, you probably can get, get through, fine with it. But I think for high level athletes are very difficult to find a vegan, high level athlete, especially in an explosive combat sports. Um, so you don't have anything to do with the diet stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:11:16       If a guy needs my help, then yeah, I'll do it. But a lot of these guys now have nutritionist, so that kind of takes a lot of work off of my back workload off my back. But

Speaker 3:          00:11:25       it's funny because fighters have a short window of time to be the best, right? I mean a fighter's career, like somebodY pointed it out once, I think it was on mixed martial arts.com that there's like a nine year period where a guy can really fight great. RIght. And then after that, excuse me, the wheels just sorta start to fall off and just the body can only take so much finding.

Speaker 2:          00:11:45       Great. You think that's a mental Thing though? Do you think they get too comfortable and they loSe it? It's possible thAt I think that's absolutely. I think why gsp quit at the right time. You know what I mean? He's got all these like gq magazine things coming up and I don't know how much money that guy's work now, but he doesn't need to fight. Yeah. Maybe the same thing happened with bj. Maybe he quit a little too late, but yeah, I think once they get too comfortable, I think then it's, that's it.

Speaker 3:          00:12:10       Silver. It is possible. I think the mental strain of camps is absolutely brutal on these guys. I mean, you would know as good as anybody, you know, I've, I've been to high level training camps, I've watched guys go out and I've watched guys go do their strength and conditioning routines and it's fucking, it's an ungodly. I barely can get through a fucking yoga class, you know, these, these guys are doing two a days and strength and conditioning in the morning, beating the fuck out of each other at night and going home and exhausted. And then one of the things that bj said about training with the marinda bitches was, it was just too much. Like his performances were legendary,

Speaker 2:          00:12:46       legendary. So was, was it the training really too much read bj had enough. that's the question to ask.

Speaker 3:          00:12:52       That's a good point. You know what I mean? By the time the has got a hold of him, he'd already had a 10 plus year career. Exactly. You know? Exactly. You look at that diego sanchez fight, I maintain. There's very few people ever that fought at 1:55. You could fuck with bj when he was in that mode. Goddamn he waS a killer. That. Exactly.

Speaker 2:          00:13:12       It's funny because I just talked to [inaudible] about this the other day. No, I, just to clarify why, what happened with us and it came down to what gary explained to me was they'd reached a point in training where they were doing their strength training in the morning. Then they had the spine was going on in the afternoons and pj approach them and you know, he wasn't like a dick about it or anything. It's totally cool. Like, hey, like, you know, how would you guys feel if we did the, uh, strength training on another day so that I can do my sparring, you know what, I'm fresh for sparring. And I think marvin gary took that as, you know, he wasn't ready for that. He wasn't at that level yet or they're ready to back off the air conditioning training. They don't do that. so I mean there's a method behind their training and it's very rational. So I think the fact that he was questioning them at that point was just like, enough. Maybe there's some other stuff goIng on. I don't know. But I think the questioning of their abilities as trainers at that point, like as if they didn't know what they were doing was enough to turn them off and kinda well wish.

Speaker 3:          00:14:13       I think what the, the mindset of fighters when it comes to strength conditioning versus versus skill work is that it's very important to stay sharp with the skill work. It's very difficult to do that if you're already exhausted from strength and conditioning. Right. So how do you find that balance? Is it, is it smarter to do the skill work in the morning and then the strength and conditioning later on the evening or like how, how do you, how do you find that balance? Are we talking about in general here? Are we talking about general? What I would perceive for, for bj either are either we're like if, if I was closer and closer to my side, if I was, is a, I probably would've done the same thIng and maybe

Speaker 2:          00:14:51       tone down the sparring a little bit already. Phenomenally skilled. Maybe the one of the most skilled fighters we've ever seen in the ufc. I was a fan of his before. He was even in the ufc, I told people this dude when I saw him at tournament's as a blue belt, black belt in jujitsu, by the way. Uh, so I've seen these guys from the start. I said, this kid's going to be freaking phenomenal. You said the same thing about nick diaz two years ago, and I was, when he was a purple belt, I'd seen him at tournament. It was a blue belt even. I'd be like, this guy, when he gets you watch, he's going to be a fighter and he's going to be phenomenal. Like tear these guys up. So pj skill has never been in question right there that tells you, hey, conditioning has always been the issue with bj.

Speaker 2:          00:15:30       I've never seen him outclass like skill wise by anybody, you know. It's always been a strength and conditioning. That's, that's costume. His fights. What did you think when you saw his last fight with frankie edgar? Would he adopted that? Very strange blown away at how stupid that was? Well, I mean that was just ridiculous. Like why would you. You're pretty much. I just had this conversation with freddie roach about a month ago. he told me bj penn was one of the best boxers he's ever trained. Really like even out of the boxers in the gym. Bj penn was one of the best natural boxers he's ever trained for folks who don't know what

Speaker 3:          00:16:01       we're talking about. Bj had adopted this very strange style that I'd never seen before. Whereas feet were very close together and he was just moving really ending up, right? Like iT's a raf almost completely straight up instead of like the classic style of a stand up fighter. I mean there's various it, there's variables when it comes to standup fighting for mma because you, you have a more squared off stance because you want to have your hips in place to take down defense. But the classic stances shoulders or a pi hands are right by the face, you know, head movement. Bj did this weird thing where it just, he looked like, like almost like a guy playing pretending to be a fighter. Like he was doing this weird and he had said afterwards, which really bothered me. He said that he did it to conserve energy.

Speaker 2:          00:16:51       That is again, conserved energy. There it is again. I thought he said because his trainers really felt that he generated more forced that way. There's no way. That's insane, but I love whatever conditions there. You don't need to worry about concerns. Right, right. Okay. So what was the consensus that made them part ways because the performances that he put on with them or individuals war legendary really work some of the best of. WhAt was it? It florian and then they did the diego sanchez fight and then they left about five weeks out from the frankie edgar fight. Really? Yeah. So five weeks at this type of training needs to be done pretty much up until the day of the fight. So they did train him a little bit for the frankie edgar, three weeks, maybe four weeks at the most and what happened and that's when they had the dIscussion about changing up the program, like a can we do the conditioning on different days and so they just decided

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       to walk away. Yeah. Wow. It just felt it wasn't going the way they want it, I think. Yeah, I think they were. They respected frankie edgar is that this guy's going to be trouble. This guy's coming to fight, has got a gas tank. He's, he's no pushover, you know, and who's a motherfucker. He's a relentless motherfucker which shows you how god damn good uriah favorites because they, you know, right. Your rise to fighting one weight class up, right. You know, usually fights it. One 35 finding 1:45 and they, they went five rounds and I mean frankie won a decision, but there was no point in that fight where he was going to finish your Ohio. No point where you. I was in significant trouble, you know, they were pretty much gone blow for blow, but frankie was getting an edge and basically every round, I think frankie is one of the best condition guys and I would love to find out what he does for his strength and conditioning because he's never fucking tired. He's always able to push that same pace every round. And that seems to be what separates the greats that truly grades from everybody else underneath them.

Speaker 2:          00:18:50       No, it's funny. It's a lot of people are talking about the dust angeles pettis fight, but between me and the yield and the rest of the world, in my opinion, rafael is in better conditioning, better shape for the benson henderson fight. Really? Yeah, absolutely. He wasn't a fight. He was injured so three weeks out he injured his knee and aspiring accident. And so we had to change things up. We couldn't do any more field work, we couldn't do any writing or anything like that. So we had to kind of modify it. And that's when you see, I got them during the sprints on the airdyne bicycle and only pretty much something safe, you know, and uh, but I had him at like 12,000 feet elevation, gradually built them up to that. so we're at high altitude

Speaker 1:          00:19:30       to the benson henderson fight was incredibly impressive because he was the first guy to ever stopped. Benson was strikes and benson is just notoriously durable, unbelievably tough, big for the weight class and, and dos anjos just jumped all over him. He had destroyed him, was a big fight. It was a big like, like, whoa, this guy's on another level right now. That's why it kind of blew my mind, like why people pay to keep reminding you, but it closer to get sentenced. I, it sounds good to us, but the recording is weird.

Speaker 2:          00:19:59       I got you. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:20:01       Don't need to repeat anything. No, it's fine. Okay, well, like I said, I think he was in better shape for the, for the benson henderson fight, you know, I don't know why people couldn't see this coming, you know, like get a good sense. Just so good. Pete. Me look at how he handled that. Right. You know, brendan, that she is fucking huge and a killer. I kids big see how big that is in real life. He's fucking big. He's a big. He's, he's a good size one. 80 five. Right. and as a seventies fucking huge. And benson handled him. Yeah. So I think people just thought, hey, this is a great fight. I mean I didn't, I didn't necessarily count dosantos out, but I certainly didn't think he was gonna stop them the way you just fucking beat his ass. Yeah, I thought it was gonna. I thought it was gonna be a really good fight. That's what I thought. I mean

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       hence pharma champion, been there with some of the best ever. You know, I've thought this is gonna be a great fight.

Speaker 2:          00:20:53       Yeah, that's interesting. I didn't, I kinda knew like at the end of the training camp, the different sites, the difference we've made in that training camp in terms of speed and power and his stamina. I just knew like I knew where he was before and I knew where he was after and I said he's just going to destroy him. Like I hope I almost wanted it to go five rounds so he could show like what it was capable of. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:21:16       Well, that's pretty crazy that he, you know, when we found out after the pettis fight, where he won the title and just one by just dominating the champion and a guy who dana white had been pretty public saying he thought was the best pound for pound fighter in the sport. and you know, I didn't, I didn't agree with that necessarily, but I'd certainly did take the kid was spectacular. I mean, the way he stopped donald cerrone, the waist up, joe lozan, I mean he was capable of just unleashing these kicks out of nowhere to put people away. He just fucking good way arm barred benson. I mean he's just in the way he caught gilbert to mean called gIlbert and good team. He's fucking good. And you think he

Speaker 2:          00:21:54       gilbert in that or do you think it was almost. I mean, not saying that fight was rig or anything, but gilbert made a terrible mistake. I mean he's sitting on his knees with his head up. He had been tagged. Yeah, that's what it was.

Speaker 3:          00:22:03       Been hurt. He, if you watch that fight, I've watched it several times. A pet his had caught him several times, some pretty hard shots when gilbert was coming in because he knew gilbert strategy was. It was no secret. Gilbert was just gonna stay on the outside a little bit, press hIm up against the cage. Who's this to the clay guido strategy essentially. Yeah, it was. Which was his first loss. I mean, that was pegasys first loss in the octagon. You know, when he first came to the ufc, he was the wec champion and clay gui to beat him. And everybody's like, well, welcome to the ufc dude. Right. And everybody kind of knew, okay, well this guy, at least at this stage of his career is vulnerable to something like this. Yeah. But gilbert just didn't have the same tools that dosantos house until sandra says much faster, much faster. He's, he's a fucking. He's a dangerous dangerous right now. Yeah, he's extremely dangerous. And his conditioning was off the charts and then when you tell me that he was knee was hurt three weeks out and he couldn't do anything but airdyne sprints. That's incredible. I mean, that's amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:23:05       Well, they're at high altitudes, so that's pretty, uh, how's he doing it at a highlight? Have the, I have an altitude simulator. I have the hypoxic altitude simulator, not the little velcro masks, but this is the actual one that thins the air and, and changes your blood oxygen levels. So, I mean it takes time to build up to that. I wouldn't recommend anyone go try it at 12,000 feet right now. You're going to have like a seizure or something, you know what I mean? Maybe I aneurism, I don't know. But it took probably three weeks to get them to that point where he was able to sprint on that thing. So I mean we'd been building up for awhile and then there's things. Obviously I can't tell you on the air because I don't give away too many people that I tell

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       you it was rigorous and there was, there was times when I would watch and I'd want to pull the plug and be like, hey, you know what I mean? but you gotta listen to your gut. And uh, just keep pushing them and know what they can take. Is that a factor, a big factor when you're working with an athlete that you have to know what this athlete is capable of and where were you going to break them that? Absolutely. I think that's probably the most critical factor. I think you hit it right on the head because it seems like you're. You're dancing that line, man. He was a thin line man and that's the way you get a guy better, right? You gotta get them right to that fucking ads and then pull them back. How have you seen the movie whiplash? Yes. That's basically sums it up.

Speaker 1:          00:24:24       Right? And then that teacher was so good at what he did. He brought out the best. I've got the wrong move in my head. You're talking about the movie. I'm not going to tell you, don't tell me about it, but I saw the ads are screaming and yelling at somebody. I was confused. I'm like, how does that factor in? That was the thing in a totally different movie, but it is, it's the, uh, I was thinking, fuck, is he going to make this a. No, no, but that's it. The intuition and the I, I believe that I as the most important in what you see and what your athletes doing, you see the speed deteriorate, then you've gone too far. You need to know how to get your, got a peak In every exercise and then cut it off. And what's the variability as far as recovery?

Speaker 1:          00:25:10       Does everybody, I mean, people must recover at different rates. Absolutely. Uh, it also depends on their past like conditioning too, you know what I mean? So like if a guy's never had a certain type of aerobic or anaerobic training and of course it's going to take a few more days to recover, that's going to take a lot longer to develop. That was one of the things that you arrive, faber said was one of the reasons why his team, the team alpha male has so few injuries. So like there's some camps that have amazing records, uh, as far as their fighters fighters when grape, but they have a giant amount of injuries. But his, his camp team, alpha male, occasionally guys get hurt. LIke tj had to pull out of the head and brow fight because of a broken rib, but those are just bones, just like you can only take so much.

Speaker 1:          00:25:56       You know, your bone is like benevidez said it best. He's like a rib at the end of the day is just a rib and it can only take so much and when it breaks it breaks. Um, but those guys are always in shape. And you're, I was saying that it's like a lifestyle thing that they never get out of shape. they're always training very hard. They're always in peak condition. So it's not about getting, having to get into shape already in shape. Well, I'd also wonder what kind of strength and strength training they're doing. And to this day, I mean, if they're doing heavy weight lifting and you're doing that, you're around, you're going to get fucked up. It's just going to happen. It destroys the muscular equilibrium. And that's been proven. So if he, if you got a good program and it helps maintain the health of the athletes and you know that's something. No, when you say that heavy weightlifting destroys the equilibrium of the athlete, would exactly do you mean by.

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       so what I mean by that is let's say a. Let's say you're doing bicep curls for example, and you're. You're doing a heavy weight lifting, you're doing heavy bicep curls, you're shortening that bicep, right? We know the one that has a muscle gets bigger, it gets shorter because of the cross-bridging. So when you shorten one muscle, you lengthen the opposite muscle and that puts the joint and the tendons and ligaments are at risk for injury.

Speaker 3:          00:27:09       Hm. So if you do like, say if you're doing something along the lines of bicep curls, it must be critical that you do tricep extensions or dips or something along those lines.

Speaker 2:          00:27:19       Absolutely. But what's more, what's even more important is to engage the tendons and ligaments, the elastic components of, of the, of the connective tissue. So the musculaR attending unit as a whole, and now that's on a, that's a whole nother level. ThAt's like a. It requires a certain amount of essential overload. Essentially it would be like the movement coming downward, like when you do a bench press, the negative portion of that, that's the eccentric portion of the lift has to come down with approximately 40 percent greater force downward. Then it goes up to maintain muscular equilibrium. How do you do that? Well, biometrics biometrics are a perfect example of that. So like

Speaker 3:          00:27:57       do you, you would not just incorporate bench press, you would do

Speaker 2:          00:28:00       like a plow metric. Manage press. How's that work? Uh, I don't know if you have video or anything that, um, you can, you can probably see on my instagram. Uh, you probably seen bj penn doing it too, so. Well, so plyometric bench press? Yeah. As opposed to a traditional bench trust on what happens with that is I can describe it when, if he brings it out. Okay. I can describe it now if you like, you see anything on this room? Is it a speed of sport? Yeah. Instagram, speed of sport. And then if you scroll down you might see one I hope finally here, here go plyometric ballistic bench press. I don't know if I'd use that one to be honest. No, I don't know. Let's check it out. Is that somebody else? It's not me. No. Okay. Let's see. This guy. He's throwing it a little too slow on the way down. You get typed in speed of sport on youtube and you can find it too. Okay, there we go. Click. If you click on that one right there. Here we go. You'll see a couple of random bits. Trina's still see a couple of other guys.

Speaker 3:          00:29:03       Whoa. Serious fucking jumps. Is that a girl? Yeah. Really, because it's a dude with crazy hair. I was like, that's the most bad ass chick of all time. If you took a jump like that. Yeah. That's like the ronda rousey of box jumpers, right? Yeah. That looks like a girl. Yeah, up until you go. Wait, what is she even doing with our endocrine system? Exactly. Like jesus christ. These are crazy jumps, man.

Speaker 2:          00:29:32       Yeah, these are. This kid came to me. This was about five weeks after a grade two ankle sprain, so you can see this heels don't even touch there. It's just All balls of the feet, the toes. So this is similar to what, like an ice have a, excuse me, a plow plow metric, um, bench press would look like, but they, we're doing with the feet right there. So these jumps, I'm like your, your big obviously on explosive movements, plyometrics. So this thing is, I've seen this on the ba bj penn training things. He said this kid is sitting with his back, he's lying on his back rather, but it's but, but has a bounce ball under it. And then there's this padded thing above him that he keeps kicking up. and what's the philosophy behind that? First of all, you learn how to control your limb better.

Speaker 2:          00:30:14       When you're upside down like that and there's no load. You get greater control of your limb at the same time you can, you can work the full extension of the foot, which is crucial in pretty much every sport. So he's catching these, these guys, these things for arms to now and so that's. So that's like a plant metric movement right there for the upper body right there. so it's explosive. Now, what's interesting is that these, other than this particular exercise, those are machines and a lot of people right here. This when joe right there. Okay, so this is the bench? Yeah. Okay, so it's. You catch it with your hands. There's pads, so he's throwing it off so he. He's maximizing this contraction as it comes off him. He's not shortening his reach. He, he's got to produce a great amount of force to throw that off his fingers.

Speaker 2:          00:30:58       That last thing he did was crazy balance ball thing. This is nuts. That's some incredible movement. He's a kids. I'm a three time national champion for taekwondo. Jesus christ. Yeah. That kid is ridiculously flexible. Look at that fucking leg. What's that kid's name? Ryan tucker. Wow. Where's he out of torrance. Torrance, California. And he's in national taekwondo champion. Yeah, that's. Taekwondo has its fault, but god was. When it comes to leg dexterity, some of those guys have the most unbelievable leg dexterity and if you could teach them all the other skills, thai wrestling, all this stuff, they have such a weird advantage with their legs. Right? Like looking at that guy. Fucking people can do that. Not many. That's not what that kind of range of motion. And he's doing it with ankle weights on. Is that what going? Yeah. How many, how much pounds?

Speaker 2:          00:31:49       Probably like two and a half pounds. just very light. Yeah, just enough to get a stretch out of the muscle. So that's what we're trying to do. Yeah. The whole method. Here's the stretch shortening cycle. So you want to stretch the muscle before you shorten it, so stretch it before you can track that plan metrics through the same thing. They put the tendons, ligaments and muscles stretch and I just snapped back with greater force. So that's called the stretch shortening cycle. So now the benefit of that is it trains fast twitch at a speed also that's relevant to the sport. So if you're not training at the speed of sport, you're training any slower than that. you're training slow twitch, you're training, you're doing a detrimental a exercise for your sport. So anytime you're doing like a heavy lift that slow. Right? You think that that's bad for the sport?

Speaker 2:          00:32:36       Absolutely. Without a doubt. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. and it's, well it is, but it makes sense if you look at the best athletes are the ones that have the highest rate of forced development, the ones that can produce the greatest amount of force in the least amount of time. Okay. So that means like a guy that can, you know, I don't know, jump and touch his head on the ceiling versus a guy that, you know, in a split second person, the guy who would take him three or four seconds to get up there. So that will be a comparison between a plyometric band trust. Like I just showed you on the video there as compared to like a 225, 250 pound bench press. So you're a biG fan of doing everything, just exploded everything. Absolutely. That's interesting because there is a school of thought, especially along with jujitsu guys, were they like a super super slow training where they'll do like a chin up and each chinup takes like 15, 20 seconds.

Speaker 2:          00:33:26       You seen that? Yeah. Do you think about that? That's just a pretty much, that's an isotonic contraction. I don't see how that even helps jujitsu at all either. well, the idea is that if you get someone's back and you're working the choke, you, you know your arms might gas out, but this way they won't match up. I'll tell you right now, as soon as the whole thing with bj penn opened my eyes to so many different things and what I felt when I was training with him was there was no strength. His technique was so precisely time that he needed absolutely no, no strength. Literally. No, sorry. It was more about timing and the speed at which he moved and so if you're squeezing the guy, maybe you need to brush up on your technique a little bit, you know what? Do you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:34:05       Like when you've trained with john. Jock I ticket. Yup. Okay. When I started jujitsu, I started with hixon gracie. I was there for three years. I got my blue belt from hixson and then I went to the machado school in redondo beach and I went there at a time. When you show up on saturdays, john, john, john, he again, haji, and they're all on the mat. There are training with the students. Plus you have bob bass, you have rick williams, you have all these great black belts underneath them where are training with all the students deaf and so how can you beat that role? I mean, that's like amazing. You know what I mean? So there's like these guys have these red things on their black lady, like, what the heck is this man? I'm like, I don't even know. Like, what planet is this?

Speaker 2:          00:34:41       Are these guys good luck. Yeah, but you've trained with john jockey. You feel how he just effortless whatever you do, you do it to yourself. You know what I mean? It was the same thing with bj penn. It's like I was a decent black belt. I was okay when I first got my black belt and then after training with bj and those guys, man, being in a, in that training camp, it completely opened my mind to fuck. I've been doing everything wrong for the last 20 years. How so? Forcing things. I was forcing everything, my workouts, I was forcing everything. I was pushing myself to the limit. I was lifting heavy weights. Money. I could squat 425 pounds. I can bench three. Oh five. I weighed 168 pounds so people can talk to me all they want about weightlifting, but I tell you right now, I am far more far stronger than I've ever been.

Speaker 2:          00:35:30       Like I might not look it, but like, just great. Don't be hard on yourself. Thanks man. Come on. You don't think I needed a nose job or anything but, but uh, it's just, it's the way the body moves as a unit as compared to weightlifting, which, which actually fragments muscle groups. So things along the lines of like bench presses and curls and absolutely it's in a sensitivity training is training the body. But what about like guys who want to bulk up, like I say, like what meckey shall stone when he trained evander holyfield to get them up to heavyweight and he had them do all this crazy weightlifting stuff. What do you think about that? A lot of that's genetics really. Yeah, absolutely. I think, oh, that's mexican supplements. Could be. It could be very well, but I think, I think genetics play a huge role in that and what's your frame can handle.

Speaker 2:          00:36:23       There's an optimal size for your frame. You know what I mean? My guys I've seen ultimately times guys would put on more muscle than their body can handle on their performance deteriorates. Sure. Vanda was a fairly big guy. Yeah. And so he can handle it with this frame plus, yeah, you have to look at the genetics of the athlete too, but if you take a guy like I'm perfect example, maybe like Michael Jordan when Michael Jordan was playing against the pistons, right? Like one of the things that he realized like, jesus, fuck, I'm getting pushed around and getting my ass kicked. I got to bulk up when a guy wants a bulk up. There's very few ways to bulk up other than lifting heavy, right? Um, I would say no, I would. First of all, let me, let me, let me say this, I think there's too much of an emphasis on getting bigger and it might've been more advisable to train your body.

Speaker 2:          00:37:11       Maybe there were certain weaknesses in his hips or his feet or lower back or obliques that were making him weaker. I've seen plenty of guys whose whose bodies are working as a unit, like with my, with the type of training that I offer a that can literally bullied like guys that are way bigger, more muscular, and it all comes down to the efficiency of the movement. You know what I mean? But a guy like, here's a good example, a guy like brock lesnar, you can't get that fucking big and less. You're throwing some really heavy shit around. Yeah. Or taking mexican style bowl a little bit. A little bit of it. Yeah. No, you're absolutely right. I mean there is, there is, but again, it then again, haines, Alaska as who beat him with more or less the bj penn approach. Exactly. Look at cain when cain is thrown a punch, you never see like there's no tension. There's no efficiency. Yeah. that's actually a good point because that's been proven, that repetitive bouts of absolute strength training, which is like your maximum strength training, like maximum bench press, the heavy lifts will deteriorate a boxer's punching power and accuracy. Really, that's been proven by the russians to erie. That's fast and it can last for up to several months still. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. So, so like say if

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       a guy goes through your conventional strength program, a dead lifts bench press, that can deteriorate his punching power

Speaker 2:          00:38:45       because it deteriorates the speed. Strength qualities. There's different types of strength. Speed. Strength is one that emphasizes speed with. It would be like maybe like 60 percent speed, 40 percent strength. Like if I had to put a ratio on, the emphasis is primarily on speed. Every sport is one by a fraction of a second. Just About, you know what I mean? Like even like a basketball team that's domInating the entire season, there's something about every play that might be 1000th of a second faster than the other teams that's making them better. and then at the end it's cumulative. You know, It all adds up and it compounds on top of each other. So at the end of the game it's, it's a mismatch. Wow. So even though the pettis fight was closer than people think it was a fraction of a second difference between rafael striking and, and strike every time, every time and that compounds and compounds and how.

Speaker 3:          00:39:38       that's a funny way to look at it, but I think you're right. You know, when he lAnded that straight left in the first round crack and you see pedis, his head snapped back. I was stunned first of all, by the speed in which he threw that shot. Right. um, I'm, I was very impressed with the speed, but also that, you know, he was able to keep that speed up through the fourth and fifth rounds. I mean, when he nailed them in the first round, I mean petta said from then on, he was having a hard time seeing out of that. It was getting pretty much fucked from then on that. That was super impressive because if you go back and watch his earlier fights, like go back and watch them against Jeremy Stevens were early in his career where he lost by knockout though the stevens highlight reel. Um, he just was different guy, different fucking human being. I mean, very few guys when you look at their early ufc career and then look at their peak performance, which dos anjos clearly is in his peak. He just won the title against one of the best guys ever in that division. But he's a different human being all around.

Speaker 2:          00:40:39       The funny thing is I don't really read too much on the internet and I that I had to have this one, you know, people sayIng pdds and all this shit. Uh, and others I see comments, there's no strength training program that can do that. If he look, it's been going on for a year, you know, we've been building it up. Uh, so if you, if you compare, like I said, like his fight with serone, he's really stiff. he, he told me himself by the third round he was gas. He goes, fatIgue. And so this doesn't like one training camp, I mean this has been going on for a year of really good trading where he and I are trading like three or four times a week. I mean, you know, granted that separate the times in between fights when he, he's got his downtime. But I mean, it, he's been very consistent with it. And uh, you get after about three months of this as when you see the tendons, ligaments and everything really start working as a unit. And that's when it really, the power and everything really come into play. So, so safe. He took a

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       guy like, um, let's just, what's this? Pull a guy out of the roster. Let's go with matt mitrione. Big heavyweight fast guy moves really well for a heavyweight. What would you do with a guy like that?

Speaker 2:          00:41:46       First thing, the guy comes to me the first day, I'm going to do muscle tests on them and find out what's going on with his body and find out if there's any types of weaknesses in his feet. And the rotational power, his hips lower back, especially a big guy, lower back and lower abdominal cavity. A flexibility his shoulders. I can't stress that enough for punching power. There is an optimal range of motion where you produce the greatest amount of force in all of your joints. So does that mean that pretty makes is pretty easy to understand, right? Like, so if my shoulder flection or my shoulder, uh, flexibility is, is, is here, I'm going to lose speed. If it's, if it's. If it's. Yeah, exactly. If it's too short, you're going to lose speed too long. You're going to lose speed to islam. Yeah. There's two flexible acts really just too much slack in the muscle.

Speaker 3:          00:42:34       So. So how would a guy get to flexible?

Speaker 2:          00:42:37       Some people are born with that and you know what I mean, that's, that can be a genetic thing or like swimmers tend to have a lot of flexibility in the shoulders. But I mean for that support their support, that's okay because they're kind of dragging that resistance, that slower resistance. But for, for a snap in the muscle, there's gotta be a little, just the right amount of tension in order for that muscle to activate as, as, as quickest. So if it's too long, imagine like a rubber band. If it's, if they're slacking the rubber band, you can't, you can't get the snap out of it.

Speaker 3:          00:43:07       Okay, I see. I see. And then is that, does that make one more prone to injuries as well?

Speaker 2:          00:43:12       Absolutely. Can cause joint instability or impingement? All kinds of stuff. Like I've heard of that with knees. Absolutely. And that goes back to the muscular equilibrium thing I was talking about. So let's imagine you're doing heavy front squats every day for like three times a week, you know, 80 percent of your one rep max or whatever, and you're doing your max is on one every other week or whatever. You're developing those quadriceps at the expense of the hamstrings. It's not even a running movement, really just a front squat. That's just a movement up and down. That's good for like putting groceries on a top of a shelf or something like that. Okay. So yeah, you're going to shorten those quadricep muscles, you're gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna. Build them and make them bigger and shorter. And what happens with the hamstring, it gets longer and weaker. So now you've got an imbalance between the two.

Speaker 3:          00:43:59       So if someone was going to do front squats, they would have to do something to compensate for that. Like maybe some sort of a dead lift, straight leg dead lift or something that hamstring oriented

Speaker 2:          00:44:09       again. Then you're training the hampshire depends, you know, let's put it this way. It depends on the sport they're going to do, but if it's. If it's a fighter fighter, I'm not going to have him doing that. No, no squats, no. No fronts, but it's not practical for the sport. One of the most vital elements for fighting in my opinion and is neglected his feet. Like, like yoU hear mark talk about the Feet. I talk about the feet all the time. The strength in the feet and what it does for the nervous system are Crucial for athletic performance. And yet it's like one of the most neglected areas. The feet like the neural impulses. So the sensory and motor nerves are very highly active in the forefoot. Okay? And this can, this can actually help speed up your reflexes by type or training the feet on different planes like balance exercises and stuff like that will actually speed up that circuitry between the reaction between the foot and the spinal cord through, uh, you know, as you speed up the neural impulses speed up the neural impulses by strengthening the feet by, without like reactive, uh, exercises, balance exercises on like slant boards and, and disks and stuff that forced the feet to stay reactive.

Speaker 2:          00:45:22       Like is, for example, it can actually, that reaction can kind of relay into the whole body, you know, can can affect the entire body. Like if you've ever been ice skating or something and you slip like your hands are already like, well, you know what I mean? They're already reacting before your brain even has time to think because it's processed in the spinal cord. It doesn't even get processed in the brain. Your reaction from your lower limbs can actually be processed in the lower portion of your spinal cord and right back out to your limbs. So you're like a safety mechanism. I see. So you bought as sort of a fail safe act. Exactly. So it's like, hey, there's no weight on the feet. put your fucking hands out dude. Exactly. Okay. Can you put your brain doesn't even know that's going on too late?

Speaker 2:          00:46:02       It would. If it did, it would. Exactly. Okay. I see. So by hyper training the feet, you keep the body in sort of a ready state for reaction and you know, it's like manipulating the safety device to increased sports performance. The guys at the ana Jim were telling me, the cub swanson does virtually all of his workouts on a balance board. It does either a balance board or balanced ball, like everything he does and he's extremely athletic. Yes. Yeah. So when you're doing these heavy, heavy lifting it dead ends. That impulse, it slows it down and not. Not to mention you're neglecting the forefoot. All these exercises are pretty much done on the ball on the hill. I was squatting, I remember I was taught to press through the heel, deadlifting the same thing, so your, your, your training over and over these movements that are not practical for a sports movement, which pretty much every sport is played on the forefoot. Yeah, that's true. Like you never really in a sport. You very rarely push off the back of the foot. So kind of moving forward when you're punching the back heels around. Absolutely. And so knoWing that it's kind of like, why are we doing this?

Speaker 2:          00:47:12       It's improper training. I mean it really makes sense. Has been preaching this for years and I, you know, and people kind of scoff at it and you see, oh no, I gotta get my heavy back squat and that's fine, but maybe this can help you with it, you know, start training the feet, looking at, looking at what we're talking about here and the sequence of muscles that you're going to start firing when you do start training the feed, like how is this a better option for squatting would be a front squat. And now let's say you take a couple of 45 pound plates and you put them onto the balls of your feet. So now you're engaging more of a sports movie and you're on the balls of your feet and you're loading up the front instead of the back, which is the back squat is technically a lower back exercise.

Speaker 2:          00:47:54       It really hits the lumbar and his lower back. A lot of front squats going to hit more quadricep muscles require for jumping, you know what I mean, as well as the core and stabilizing the spine with the abdominals and everything. So that's just a thought like maybe you can do that. You think like, start thinking in that process where you're training from the feet up the forefoot up, not just the heels of the forefoot up and you'll start connecting different muscles require for sports movements. Um, uh, we were talking before the podcast that I'm really getting into yoga recently, last couple of weeks I've been into it, like in one of the things that is really shocking to me is how much my feet hurt. Like all the bouncing on my feet give out before a lot of other stuff and. But I do so many things barefoot.

Speaker 2:          00:48:41       I lift barefoot box all jujitsu, all that stuff's barefoot. Right? But for whatever reason, like just standing there, holding your foot up in the air and stretching out my foot is the one that's having a hard time dealing with it. It's kinda. Yeah. It's very interesting. Obviously I've weak feet in some weird way. Yeah, it's a. It's just. It never was. It was never tested before. The problem with that is when you do have weakness in the feet, other things start to compensate. Like your hips, your hips start to compensate for the weaknesses and the feet. I'd say a lot of guys have flat feet. They have poor hip abduction and adduction or tight hamstrings. Flatfooted guys almost always are a little hamstring dominant when they're sprinting. They're good at like the acceleration phase, but the tops the tops be. is it lacking? I have flat feet.

Speaker 2:          00:49:31       Do you? Do you get tight in the hamstrings? Not really. No. No. I mean he might be. The exception to the rule will have very flexible hamstrings. Probably the weed weed my hamstrings. Nah, I'm just kidding. No, I just uh, grew up doing taekwondo. I have a lot of. So for whatever reason I don't, I don't have tiging back there, but um, it, it, I definitely a flat fee. Can we start? You know, kelly, uh, he wrote that book, the sub sea. The crossword guy. Yeah. Yeah. He, he wrote a book called the supple leopard. He, he doesn't even believe in flat feet. He said he thinks it's like you said, it's like you're sort of almost like learning from people around you to walk and stand a certain way and it's almost like a laziness of the posture of your foot. To paraphrase him, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:50:16       I'd have to read it thoroughly and he thinks that you could retrain someone to have a hierarchy. You can't. ABsolutely real. Yeah. Done it really from a guy like me because I guy like, like I said, like the balance balancing type exercises we have and the foot strengthening modalities that we use. Well, definitely, man, I, I challenge you to try this. If you try like a calf raise, like or you can go on like a seated seated a leg press and don't put any weight on there, just do a few of your shoes on. Okay. Then take your shoes on and try a few without your shoes and really accentuated the movement and the toes to the tip of the toe and not just to the pad of the toe, but to the tip of the toe and see the difference you feel on your achilles and your calves.

Speaker 2:          00:51:00       Okay. I guarantee you it's going to blow you away. A tremendous difference when you just use that little bit, that little extra inch of your toes and you feel it all through the arch of the foot and you fill it all the way up through the calf. it's really police something else. that's where I always have pain in my foot. Yeah. It's always like a. I got pain there from skiing. I get pain there from sometimes hiking gives me some pain there. Yeah, that's fixable. Interesting. Okay. we'll talk about me later in that, but that a lot of people have issues with that. A lot of issues with flat feet. Um, do you find that fighters ever have issues plotting, like say if you get a guy and like maybe he's kind of lumbering like we all know fighters that just, they just don't move well on their feet.

Speaker 2:          00:51:47       For example, roselawn has the flattest feet I've ever seen an athlete really actually maybe top three and so, but surprisingly after this training camp he had a little bit more strength than I noticed that less of a drop in the arches of his foot. And so that says something about what we're doing and there were points in the fight where you can see him bouncing around on his feet and he looks pretty quick. I think even like the 10th or 11th round, he was popping around on his feet and the announcer said, what is this? He's bounced around his feet. It looks quick. What's he doing now? Is this some kind of strategy or whatever? And uh, no. So we made incredible gains in like the strength of his feet and his cast, you know, unfortunately he fights flatfooted. He comes at you head first and you know, that's just the style.

Speaker 2:          00:52:29       But yeah, he was coming on in the later rounds. Matina was cracking him early in that fight. That was a war to comment of the best I've ever seen could be, could very well be. He did get hurt. He got hurt one of the rounds and it slowed him down. It's hard to not say throws bombs. Yeah, he was, he was really pleaseD with his conditioning though. He came out, he actually came by on the way to the packet. I'll fight. He flew into lax and he stopped by my gm And he wanted to give me a bonus. He's like, I've never felt like that. Am I in a fight? Even though I lost like that's the best I've ever felt. Like it's awesome. And I said, uh, like, you know, I looked as managers and actually like maybe we should just wait until you win little accent, you know, we'll, we'll take care of when it.

Speaker 2:          00:53:11       When on a winning day. so did you see the, a urine sample that he gave? Yeah. Tasty, huh? Yeah. For folks who don't know, if you look on providing a coughs, a instagram page was a photo of his, his urine sample looked like coca. Yeah. It, we've showed it a bunch of times in this podcast because it's so fucking crazy. Yeah. I've never, I've heard of that before. Guys who do like ultra marathons, my friend cameron hanes, he's done an ultra marathon. He said pop like coke, breaking down muscle and dehydration and all that and kidneys, kidney problems, you know, who knows. So to that fight was just that fucking brutal. It was insane. I'll tell you what, one of the first, I mean, first of all, I have so much respect for both of those guys. Like when tesa and rose on honor, both in my top five, top 10 fighters with tcs punching power is freaking ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          00:53:58       Ridiculous. I don't remember, I was in there and I was like, where am I, where am I going to sit? I, you know, I was going to be originally going to be in a corner and then I ended up getting a seat at ringside and I turned my back and I'm, there's a first round, 10 seconds in. I'm already hearing the punches behind me. I'm like, oh fuck, I got to run around and get my ass over there as quick as I can because it's go another round. You know, you're in a good fight and you can hear those punches landing. It's just ridiculous like the power that they generate. But tisa is a monster. Puts those, a monster. He's the way he keeps coming and coming and moving and throwing bombs. But jesus would've fight. That was. And the, and the. And the cool thing about that was I like roselawn at, but the last, the fights year prior to that, you know, he attended, had a tendency to fade after three or four rounds and whatever that was, you know, focus or conditioning, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:54:47       But even if his mental focus, you need to condition that as well. And so this training camp, I really dedicated a lot of time to learning how to push him into the later rounds and get into bringing it more and more as a, as a fiber grass. Now I'm freddie roach trained sim as boxing. Yeah. And what was like freddy's assessment of like the difference in his performance from training with you is what we can get out of him in the gym. He looked great. Everybody was pleased with his barring. Like this time they said this is the best he's ever looked in inspiring, like phenomenal and a renaissance of kind, kinda like a robot. Like whatever he does inspiring, he's pretty much going to do on the fight. And so even in sparring he would come on a little slow and then pick it up towards the later rounds of sparring.

Speaker 2:          00:55:34       And uh, so I, I don't think it surprised anybody in the performance. Like freddy, he even said in the beginning, you know, it's a 50 slash 50 fight, like I don't know who's going to win this. And uh, to be honest, that fight went down exactly how I thought I would exactly in the dressing room before we walked out. I said to the ra, I pulled the ref aside and I asked him, you know, hey, look what happens if he gets head butting in like first or second round, I shit you not. I asked him that. Wow. And I said, are you going to stop the fight? He going to have him check it or You gonna let him keep fighting. If there's blood, you know, I just want to get some things clear because I kind of had this weird feeling and uh, sure enough, second round and I had a feeling matina is going to win by decision and I just, sometimes you just get that weird feeling, you know, there's an aura and a, you can put all the work and you want. But you know, like if it's not your night and it's not your night and there's just something. So there now provided

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       a cough. What kind of diet does that guy follow? Because I'd read some crazy shit about like until he was like, yeah, he had, he'd only eaten raw meat and now he still eats raw meat. Really not when he's here. He has a, he has a nutritionist here, but where does he like when he's inside barrier barrier? Yeah. What is it? They sell it like in his talent. I guess they sell it in restaurants and shit. Like you can go into a restaurant and just go, hey, I'll have a moose heart. Really? Yeah. So they all, they're all used to eating raw meat. They're like eskimos. You know what I mean? They're really, they're really ahead of the times. Well there's something to be said for those genetics, I'll tell you that. Yeah. Because those are some fucking stout human beings and that diet has got to be like incredibly nutrient dense protein.

Speaker 1:          00:57:12       absolutely. If you're in as long as you're eating, you know, game animals and not predators, you know, you can pretty much get away with that. They were eAting bear. Obviously you couldn't eat it raw, but eating a caribou or something like that. Raw. you're reading it fine. I've eaten cariboU before. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'd be interested to try that. It's very. It's reindeer reindeer. Like santa has reindeer. There's caribou. Elk. Elk is delicious. I've had a. I've had raw horse in montreal. I had a horse tartare. Yeah. The ground up this raw horse and served it with like egg on it and everything. Like raw egg on it. It was a manager saying, yeah, there's thIs place called joe beef and montreal. Is that fresh? Oh yeah, yeah, they do that. Do they kill the whole, I don't know. Fresh. You'd think that they'd killed the whole horse and some little would spoil or do they just like take off limbs at a time and then like is a good question?

Speaker 1:          00:58:06       I don't know. I mean the thing I don't know, when you buy beef that you buy from the stores fresh, they're not freezing your stakes for the most part. Some fish is frozen, but almost all beef you're buying is been killed fairly recently. Some of it's dry aged, but this was, this horse was, you know, I guess I actually, they killed a horse in America, but you can't sell it in America in stores, but you can kill them in America and then they export them to, to Canada. It's very tricky, you know, because people have very strong attachments towards them as animals, as pets. yeah. But a delicious. Although weird, you know, I don't have any horse horse, you know, I'm not about to eat a dog provider. Worse. Might trip me out. Yeah. What's with the cats? I think I saw a picture of your cats or something.

Speaker 1:          00:58:55       You got cats, girl. I've always had cats. I have a 19 year old cat. I've had her since she was a baby. Yeah. is that bad? no. So it's just different when you try to. Seemed like a macho guy. I'm balanced. I got to get in touch with the feminine side. Touch with my feminine side. I like little dogs too. Is that okay? Yeah. That's great. What if I have a little dog in a purse? I carry it around. Batman. Think you're pushing. Chuck liddell does. Desi, chuck odell was a little tiny chihuahua. He used to take with them everywhere. Nobody said shit. exactly. Iceman

Speaker 2:          00:59:35       cats, man. My daughters love cats. Yeah, they're cute. You got daughters. Oh, that's rIght. Yeah. You want to soft shoulders, which was a comedy, a comedy club in hermosa few years ago. Oh, the comedy magic. Fucking phenomenal guy. I never saw it before. I remembered you from the. Was it the sitcom news radio news radio. I thought that was pretty funny there. And then I saw you at the thing. My buddy got us tickets and I was just like blown away. Oh, thanks for the thing about the daughters

Speaker 1:          01:00:03       in her hand. That's true. Story resonates in my mind. Really did, man. Yeah. She's lIke, I want to go to bed. Mad dogged me. Does a total true story. I had to figure out how to react like this is. You don't want to freak out about this because this. Then she'll know that you can get a ride.

Speaker 2:          01:00:21       The other day I made a mistake. I swore in front of my kid. He's going to be two on a few weeks and I said that I was frustrated. I was tired. I want to get in the shower and I'm holding him in one arm and I hit the dimmer on the light switch. It doesn't work properly, so you're always messIng with it to get it to work. It's a fucking lights.

Speaker 1:          01:00:37       It just said, brad, I love it and I try to get this thing to work. my son goes fucking light. Okay, that's great. Now everything. No, it's still going on. This is like a month and a half ago. It's still going on. Fucking uncle rudy. Fucking garbage car. You know, as soon as you give it like a, a response, then it's like, oh, their eyes light up. Like you don't have to say anything. I mean it. Your eyes just kind of latch on is like, oh dude, did you just say that? So two days ago, a mommy and me class, kids are singing twinkle twinkle little star. I shit you not fucking lights fucking lights. I feel like such a bad dad. No nonsense. Don't let those people fuck with your head. I'm not cares. You're a grown adult. Your fork and knife. He Said fork and knife and you go, but don't even lie about it.

Speaker 1:          01:01:28       Is there anything wrong with saying those words today? You and I are together. Two gRown adults. So stop. Everybody stopped. My wife always says that. My wife gets mad if I swear on the kids, you know, just like stop with the language. I like pushing bitch. Fuck you think I make a living and make a living with this language. This is called english. It's called american english. And occasionally we say, fuck jesus. Don't say that's cool. Kids. My three year old, when she was three rather we were skiing. I took them skiing from the time they were really little, like my kids have been skiing since they were two. And um, uh, when she was three, we're packing all the stuff up. We're getting ready to leave. We're leaving the trip and we're in the hotel and uh, you know, she's got her little bag is zipped up and my wife goes, we forgot to put the helmet in the bag and the little kid, she's three, she goes, shit, my

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       wife looks at me and her eyes, her eyes light up and I had a fucking turned my face and run out of the room because I couldn't stop laughing. I laughed. It was funny, but I didn't want to like, make sure she finds something that's funny, like she loves being funny because I'm a big laugh. So when she says funny shit, I just fucking fall overlap. So I had to be real careful about that when she was three, but it was just something funny, but she wasn't even doing it to get attention or anything. She's just looking her suitcase. My wife has the helmet. She realized the helmet's not a suitcase. He goes, shit, tiny, tiny first and say shit is fucking like if we were, it was just you and I forgot your senior. How might you be like, gosh, that would be normal.

Speaker 3:          01:03:06       That was normal to her. Yeah, I just, I don't buy this. It's something wrong with kids swearing. It's fucking stupid. Dumb. Well there's a certain age when it's okay. What's that age 19. Because then when they start fucking isn't when they drink. Like when, when is it okay to swear like we're babies with our fucking language and it's so dumb because it's all just by television. It's all like the censorship that we've imposed upon ourselves with television is the same censorship that we bring into the household and you expect from kids at school. Like I don't give a fuck about language. I, I, w I appreciate how people treat each other. How do you, how do you talk to me? Are you nice? Are you friendly? If you're friendly and you say, fuck, I feel good about talking to you. You know, if you're a rude person and you don't use bad language or you're uncomfortable or you're, you're not kind or considerate, then I, then I feel gross about talking to you.

Speaker 3:          01:03:57       But if you're a normal person you say, fuck what? What kind of a weirdo cares about that? But we've imprinted it into our brains and the same retarded shit. We pass it down from parent to child and parent, the child and the widow. When does that stop? When? When do we stop giving so much power. These stupid fucking words. It's dumb. Just dies. A parent. It drives me fucking crazy. Drives me crazy because I know that it's not like when people are alone, when they're comfortable, when they're together, when they're out drinking, when they're at a bar or restaurant, they swear and it's fun. It's freeing. It's liberating. But you're in an office. Everybody's dressed like a fucking penguin. Some weird stupid outfits. You know? It's, it's dumb. It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't mean it's a weird habit that we're stuck in that people think is like, oh, you've got a lot of class with your language.

Speaker 3:          01:04:47       Fuck you. Shut up. This is stupid. So dumb way to express yourself. It doesn't make any sense to me. Yeah. I don't really think that much about. It drives me nuts. It drives me nuts, man. Because I've had people come on my podcast and I'm like the podcast, like someone will say it was a great podcast except for rogan's language and my language like he. He asked great questions. If you get past the language, it was a great conversation. If you say it in like a foreign language. Yeah, right. Some the word french, french word for fuck. It's just silliness. It's, it's infant tile. It's like it's self imposed infantile behavior and one year the adult, when you're a grown person, you're a fully grown adult. You t, you pay your own bills, you feed yourself the whole deal. You decide when you go to bed, like the idea that you were imposing this stupid language restriction.

Speaker 3:          01:05:40       The only language I care about is language that expresses like human interaction. Yeah. I. I care about derogatory language. I care about offensive, evil language, racist language. That kind of stuff bugs me, but just saying fuck the. The type of people that do that. The good thing about that is if you find someone who cares about that, you know you're, you're around an idiot. Just avoid that dummy. I got a little excited, I got a little carried away with that. That thought we got off track. That's why this podcast is. We should change the name of it too. Off track. What do you see in the store on sunset? Pinches tacos. You know what that means? No fucking tacos. Really? Yeah. Good, good, good. I hope somebody protests. I hope some social justice warriors have it closed down because it's racist or something. I hope white people on it.

Speaker 3:          01:06:31       I don't know. Fun. Google. Yeah. I don't know man. I just think we're. We're very childish when it comes to language. That's not the point. This podcast, the point is pocket. I have just so many questions for you. I'm sure I'll get back to this because it's really fascinating. What do you think when you watch those countdown shows and you see like guys do with the battle ropes and there's like a bunch of very specific things that you see. You see like guys pushing sleds, that's a big one. The weight sled pushing that fucking sled. Um, you see like all these different ways of training. What is like the biggest mistakes that you see

Speaker 2:          01:07:12       or what you feel are based mistakes? Obviously they exercise modalities like, I don't know how pushing a sled is even relative to like mma. I mean if we're talking about mma guys up against the cage, what if you get pushing them? Are you holding him?

Speaker 3:          01:07:27       Well, if you're trying to push the guy up against the cage, say if you get, you get in a collar tie, right, and you want to push the guy up against the cage, you want to work your entire. You want to work needs to the body that seems

Speaker 2:          01:07:36       that would be more about leverage of the leg, the leg, the placement of the leg, and the leverage and the power of the foot, which I take it, which we go back to. The strength and the feet. The feet of the strength of the foot can not be understated. They've done studies like on olympic weight lifters that show that the force, uh, excuse me, the foot actually produces the greatest amount of force and the olympic weight lifts. So real. Yeah, it's the actual foot. If you look at the leverage of the joint there, it's just such a short lever. So the pushing off the ground for clean. Exactly. That produces more forced than, than, than the quadricep. Even even the hip. That's amazing. Yeah. So, um, are you opposed to cleans and presses and things along that? I'll have my guys do them and I'm not going to say there are terrible.

Speaker 2:          01:08:23       I think if you start going too heavy then yeah, you're overloading your spine and you're doing a disservice to the rest of your body. But like what's too heavy? I think something that you can't do quickly and incorporate the stretch, the stretch shortening cycle. Like I said, plyometrics in my opinion are the king for strength, for strengthening the body. So box jumps, those type of exercises. Were you doing the descending exact press and catching it? Anything where the muscles being put on stretch and then firing back at a, at a faster rate. So you can even do that manually. Like to exercise for the hips. You can do that with a hand throwing the leg down and work it in different angles. So imagine strengthening every muscle in your body plan metrically. Then you've got like a fast twitch animal. It's highly trained. Can you take a guy who's slow and you can make them fast solutely there's through the stretch shortening cycle again, which is the neural neural impulses, uh, that go through the muscle and the stretch shortening cycle actually, like, let me give you an example of this.

Speaker 2:          01:09:25       So imagine you go to the doctor and you're sitting in the doctor's chair and he comes up and he hits you in the knee, you know, he does the patellar tests to kick test. That's a stretch shortening cycle. And what, what he's doing, he's testing for any kind of abnormalities like that might be in your spine or, or might show up in your nervous system. It could be some other kind of disease or whatever. But what it's doing is it's sending a neural impulse through the, through the tendon. Okay. All the way up through the, through the muscle, into the spine, and then inhibits the hamstring so it switches the hamstring off. Okay. And that's why your leg jerks without you even having to try to do anything right there. So like, you know, you just sit there, you're not making a kick. So that's what's going on.

Speaker 2:          01:10:04       Exactly. So exactly. So if you, if you hit the hand, if he hit the right in the patellar tendon, your leg kicks, it's actually switching off your hamstring simultaneously at the same time. It's activating the quadricep so you get a greater, you get a greater contraction now, the quadricep without even trying. That's where the efficiency that you've been talking about comes in. So by training the stretch shortening cycle, you can, you can duplicate that throughout the entire body as long as you're training every muscle like that. So do you have like a standard mma fighter protocol that you follow or does it vary depending upon what the athlete brings to you in the first place? Do or do you try to get them to a place and then work from there? Yeah, absolutely. Like I said, we start with muscle testing to determine weaknesses like the feet and the hips. What, how do you do this muscle? Manual testing per, you know, for example, all hold your toes and I'll have you try to push me back and I'll feel like it's like a manual muscle test like something a chiropractor might do or our physical therapists and looking for weaknesses and then the hips. You can test the abduction and adduction. You can turn the person over and you can test the rotation of their hip here which is.

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       And all these things play into the mechanics of sporting movement, so the rotational muscles of the hip. If you've got, let's say you're right handed and you've got weak rotational muscles in the eye and the left and your left leg, that's going to affect your left hook, right? Same with the right hand, straight, right hand. If you got a weak gluten ham contraction, you're going to have a a weakness in your straight right hand if you're punching from the hip, I mean assuming you're punching with good mechanics, right? And so all these factors play into where we want to get them. So first you would remediate the weakest link first. So 99 times out of 100, it's the feet. And the hips with the guys and then like usually the lower back and the shoulders. So you get like, watch the video that I remember gary I think is explaining it when he trained bj penn, like you know, first we fixed his feet and then his hips and it's the same strategy for remediating weakness. Like you want to, you want to strengthen all these weak links first to get the kinetic chain working, you know all the way through. So.

Speaker 1:          01:12:15       So if you get a guy and say the guy has lower back issues is really common with bj players, brazilian jujitsu guys that work, the guard. Especially a lot of them have lower eddie bravo. Right. He's just serious lower back problems. What would you do

Speaker 2:          01:12:28       that. First of all I'd probably want to turn them over and fill with his spine. Feels like and feel for, for what the vertebraes lined up like and his hips. And then I. And then I do

Speaker 1:          01:12:40       visual assessment of his lower back and tests. He's extremely flexible guy, right? In some ways. Tight hamstrings. So tight hamstrings. Yeah. He's, he's a guy that's fucked up. I can probably fix them up. No problem. You think so? Absolutely. Guaranteed. Eddie bravo. Yeah. Where are you? Gonna? Call nick. Let's go. Eddie. I think I trained with him a long time ago, man. He used to wear the head gear and like a wetsuit thing on. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This was probably like 15 years ago when he had really long hair. He used to tuck in a wetsuit. Yeah, it was pretty cool guy. Yeah, he's awesome. He's a character, but his, uh, his flexibility's very unusual. His leg dexter is very unusual in the hips. His ability to, you know, like when you called jail break, like say if you have them inside control him, he can pick his foot up without even grabbing with his hand.

Speaker 1:          01:13:27       Bring it across like that. Yeah. Get a deep butterfly hook and in turn and face you. Yeah. It's amazing. It's an amazing dexterity that he has now. I guarantee I can fix it. I fixed nfl player's backs and those guys have the worst backs. So savvy guy get a guy who's got some bulging disks, a bunch of shit going on. That's kind of sketchy, like I don't want to be sued for anything, you know what I mean, and like, but there are some tricks like traction stretches, you can do like some manual therapy stuff that I've learned from a very like, uh, well, like, well respected, um, neurologist and physiologists, crazy russian guy scientists and uh, so we've implemented a lot of that stuff to, for the health of the spine. And uh, yeah, there's some stuff you do to relieve the pressure

Speaker 2:          01:14:11       there because back and neck, those are really common with grapplers. So I know so many wrestlers who have fused disks, like tito ortiz, I think he's got three fused. He's got one in his neck fuse and I think he's got to and it's back one of his lumbar and maybe one thoracic or something like that. Yeah, I had to have the steroid injections in my neck. Dji herniated discs, five gen, pretty aggro back then. And so I had the cortisone. Yeah, exactly. What are they, the, they put you to sleep for that? Is that the cortisone? Yeah, I dunno. Yeah, they put me under for it, man. And it was, it was, it was. I couldn't sleep for three weeks before I had the shots. I mean I was up in so much pain. My atrophied, it looked like a wet noodle. Yeah. So you had a pretty good one.

Speaker 2:          01:14:57       What happened to your neck? Uh, I got thrown into a wall and jujitsu and I just crunched, but I think it was more like years and years of building up, you know, and then they found there's like a bone spur in there that like irritates the nerve and so they have to go in there and take the bone spur out. But I probably will one day, but not yet. I have so many friends that have atrophy issues with the neck where their arm shrinks. Yeah. Bas rutten. He had his neck fused. He, he actually had some significant neck problems for years. And then he was on thinkers on sons of anarchy, one of those shows where he was doing a stunt and they throw them on his head and just cried, man. Yeah. And his arm just went foreign and then it shrunk up. Boy calls it baby arm.

Speaker 2:          01:15:44       He's got one arm, it's still to this day, hasn't romoland. Yeah, he had several operations. He has disc fused in his neck. He uh, he had um, the, the nerve opening. They go in there and they sort of carve it out, clear, clear the opening to relieve the pressure on the nerve and even that, like he probably did it all too late in his arm, had been atrophied for so many years that it just, uh, it's a long process to rebuild the neuromag I know about that. There's out for you. Yeah, well I was in a car accident till where I was actually rear ended. That guy was going about 100 miles an hour. Geez. Yeah. So shattered my pelvis, broke my hip. I've got a plate in there now. Like a steel plate. Whoa. Yeah. And so I was in a wheelchair for like six months, but the nerve, like apart from all the muscular, you know, rebuilding the muscular, the muscles and all that, the nerve pain from the recovery was the worst.

Speaker 2:          01:16:39       I mean I still have like right now I can fill it up my foot. This is like 10 or 12 years ago and I just felt like animals were eating my toes off man. I remember waking up one night like screaming in pain, like fuck did my foot as something eating my foot and I looked down there and the toes are kind of moving on their own and that was the nerve waking back up. Wow. And it was excruciating. I mean even like I said, even to this day I still feel it, you know, get some issues in my toes with that. But that's why a lot of guys didn't have back pains and women as well. Obviously they, they get really hooked on pain pills. It's like it gets to a point where I got hooked on them, man. I'm not gonna lie to the point where I would take my pain pills and then I would take a laxative because this shit makes you constipated.

Speaker 2:          01:17:20       So like I was taking a lot of those things, like on a daily basis, you're doing that for four or five months, man. You're going to get hooked. How'd you get off a? My will. I think that was it. Yeah. I'm weird like that, like I don't get addicted to things, but like when I go too deep, if I feel like something bad's gonna happen to me, like emotionally or I can snap out of it, but yeah, that's self preservation man. I got when I used to think about taking them, I get that taste like under my tongue, like it candy, you know what I mean? Yeah. I mean it was brendan schaub said the same thing. A sharp didn't even realize he was hooked on him. He was taking them every day for like three or four months and then his friends apparently intervened and said, hey dude, you're fucking whacked out all day.

Speaker 2:          01:18:06       You got to get off. These pills were were the pills? They went to his house, cleaned out his bathroom cabinet and said, enough, do we just did that with my buddy like two weeks ago? He had a dirt bike accident. His fucking bone. Can I tell you a quick story? Okay. You know what those things are. Have you ever seen a razor scooter with a cage around on either built to crash? Oh no. Fuck no. I think I'm looking at a different thing. It's kinda like an atv but a little bigger and two guys came like a dune buggy, like a miniature dune buggy with a cage around it and guys go up hills. Like you can see all these fucking guys in the south. Love them and yeah. So you know where I'm going with this fucking gnarly. So this guy killing my buddies, buy a brand new and they're like, come on out.

Speaker 2:          01:18:48       It'll be a great weekend, man. Let's go fucking writing this weekend. Whatever. Long story short these guys ended up in the hospital, they flipped the thing and one guy busted his scalpel open. He's got a whole like size of a golf ball, broke his arm. My other buddy broke his arm and like four places just had surgery. So our third friend who went with him, he called me. He's like, man, these guys have been in an accident. The next day he sent someone, sends me a text of him laying down with a bone popping out of his fucking go indian burial ground. Dude, what the fuck is this shit? You know what I mean, like all these kids got made. Yeah, it's a great weekend guys. Thanks. But one of them got really hooked on the, on the pain meds and he went from being a super active guy too, just staying home all day, being hooked on pain meds and we were like really worried about him. Like he was calling us like crying like dude, I'm going to do something bad. I'm going to on. And we got this thing called bro chat on facebook. A bunch. A group of our old buddies got together and we started a group chat like probably like two months ago. I everyone who has practically been kicked off facebook for it for one reason or not sending pictures, you can imagine the shit. But man, we all got together on umbrella chat and we saved his life to broach. That saves.

Speaker 2:          01:20:00       It, saves it. It pisses off wives because I swear to god, every one of us is on there until like 1130 at night laughing our ass off.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       All the girls are putting the babies to sleep the fucking flow, man. You can get a girlfriend or something. A honey. I'll give you a blow job if you get off the phone. I fucking wow. Hilarious. Some bros before blowjobs like, yes, not me. I'm the first one off. I just go in there to save you, man. That's it. I've had several friends that have had like serious pill issues. Uh, it's, it's, it's weird how prevalent they are and how easy it is to get them. Yeah. You know, I had my nose fixed. I had a deviated septum so they cleared it all out, cut the turbinates out. Stretched open though the openings, like put splints in there and shit, and actually kind of widened the physical look of my nose and kind of changed a little bit because it was like a little more sucked in like nasal breathing.

Speaker 1:          01:20:58       Anyway. Point is, it wasn't fucking painful. Really mean. It was when it was over, it was over and I need that. I have a deviated septum is one of the best things I've ever done. I didn't do it till I was like, I think it was 39 or something like that, but once I did it was like, yeah, I get this big. Rafael just had that done. Did he? Yeah. He because of, I don't know if that had been going on for a long time. Like he had it so bad he couldn't even breathe that junior. Joe santos did as well. Huh? Interesting. Well it's just fighting, you know? Yeah. I had my nose broken for the first time when I was five. I fell down a flight of stairs and it was always kind of crooked, like the bones kind of weird. And it was inside.

Speaker 1:          01:21:37       It was always fucked up. But then years of just getting smashed in the face, he just gets awful. It's a point like, you remember vandelay would vandelays knows you slipped from flat to his face. Yeah, just smushed down. No cartilage at all. Everything just mushed. And every bumper door, farc the farc. Right. Um, he, uh, he had his fixed and he went deep the other way. You've got like an extra big nose so he could breathe better. Like they constructed, it knows out of his rib. Let's see. Yeah, it looks really. How dare you. I dare you. I see you're being sarcastic. Well, I mean for practical purposes, you want to be a fighter, really smarter, which shows a lack of vanity. It does. And he didn't try to look at all. He cut out all the scar tissue in his neck, that eyebrows, you know, because he was getting that.

Speaker 1:          01:22:27       There's another thing that fighters get, is that sort of relaxed, it impedes vision. Absolutely. In some guys have it so bad that you can see there are lids. Yeah. Because I guess it's from punishment from getting hit repetitive scar tissue, scar tissue and also like the relaxation of the muscle. That new nurse probably. Yeah. So it starts to fall over the eye and it actually gets in the way. It's vandelay, but that's vandelay before he got fucked up. That's vandelay. That's when he was young. Probably like 2003. That's uh, that's the early days of annually. That's vandelay when he was the pride channel and labeled knows number one. Well, you got to see vandelay in like, that's what he looks like now. I mean his eyes are different, but that's not what it looked like right after the surgery. Like that's his face with cat woman after the surgery.

Speaker 1:          01:23:18       Right. He came onto the scales, uh, at the, uh, at the ufc and he was cornering. Somebody stepped up to the cage. Like that's him. You see where the pink tape on his gloves. That's him and his, his best. That's before his nose was fucked up. That's when, that's probably him in 2001 or something like that. I mean that was a, that was vandelay in his prime. I want to say that looks like it was right before rampage jackson or something like that. Two thousand one, 2002. His nose was fine. And then if you see like vandelay versus chocolate dell, I have a poster on my wall in my gym at home, have a vandelay versus chocolate. Dell and vandelays knows is just smashed. It's just like flattened to his face. And that was a, like that one where his arms are up in the air.

Speaker 1:          01:24:03       Jamie, see that picture up there, like click on that. Go go large on that. You could see in that one. I think that's, that's it seems like after the [inaudible] fight that it's tough to tell there. But for a lot of tHe fights, like his nose was just useless. He couldn't breathe out of it. So he went the other way and he got this fucking crazy nose job where they gave them a bigger nose so he could breathe out of it. Yeah. so you see like knows number three, like that image right there. Yeah. Look, look how much bigger is this? But that's smart. It's like he did that so he could breathe out of it better. There's a lot bigger, like the bone or the cartilage, you could see it like goes lower. Like when you're talking to them it went lower to like sort of like he has a big accentuated cartlidge there.

Speaker 1:          01:24:50       That guy has taken some fucking punishment. You want to talk about a warrior for christ. I mean that guy has been in fucking wars like down there. You see all those images. Look at that one where he's got the white tank top right there, to the right of that, right below. That it right there. That's where you could see a tough now, not even at his worst. It's not even at its worst. At its worst was right before we got the operation. I think it was just completely that after the operation right there. I think that might be photoshop him. He was jimmy duranti for halloween, but that's a dated right there. Right there. That black one in the black shirt. Oh man. Yeah. His nose pretty smashed there, but that might be after a fight. Yeah, I mean that's not even at the worst. I mean he's. That guy has taken some fucking insane damage in his career and we've watched his face alter because of that damage. Out of all the fighters in the ufc and in pride and in mma in general. His face as altered the most because of punishment. [inaudible] probably second close. Yeah, but mandalay's more than anybody because he's the one that got it fixed. He's the only. Only one of those guys that got it fixed. Nick diaz had some stuff done to his eyebrows

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       till you said he had so much scar tissue that had. He actually had his bone shaved down to because it's the edges of his bones. I'll cut you. A couple of guys. I trained in the Philippines like that. They're pretty susceptible to cut. You want to see some boxers, man. He's like, did you see the genetic, lufkin and chocolate? Yeah, totally. Dude, you want to go see getting a glove can this weekend at the forum? They got me. I said, no, I want to go see chocolate. Tito. Tito is a bad dude. He is. One of my guys fought him in Japan about maybe six months ago and I did a hell of a lot better than the other guy. Kind of stopped short. we, I don't think we would want to. We probably wouldn't have won that fight either way. You know, chocolate tito's amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:26:44       But uh, these lighter weight division is 1:12 division and the [inaudible] eight division right now are like exciting divisions and I'm, I'm just stoked that they got some coverage in the us, like on hbo shows. Like I mean it's, it's really a stacked. If you really look into it. THe lighter weight man, it's really stacked and there's a lot of action, a lot of knockouts, as long as they have short referees, like a jockey that'd be sick. He didn't like. If you have a 108 pound fighter, you got to have a little tiny reference. Right. You know, and maybe slower the ropes a little bit too. Like you did a good move. I really thought about that. The last fight you see better, but I got a guy who I trained in the Philippines, daunting yet says noni, and yet he's the longest reigning filipino champion of all time and this guy is such an exciting fighter.

Speaker 2:          01:27:33       He moved, his nickname is aha. Switch in the gulag means snake. Oh. So he moves like a snake in the ring. Like his head movement. He, his speed and timing are just on another level, but he's got one punch knockout power for 100, eight pound fighter. It's ridiculous. The power of this sky generates whatever happened in novato, dinair. He's a. I'm actually gonna be seeing him in a few weeks in the Philippines. He's a, I worked with him for one flight and I actually ended up having to leave like maybe like three or four weeks before the fight, you know, some things, whatever. But um, he kinda, I think my personal opinion, I liked the guy as a person. He's a fucking great guy. Did like a really cool person. Seems very cool. He really is. But I think what he got that fighter the year thing I maybe went to head a little bit and then, you know, I'm sure you're probably hearing this.

Speaker 2:          01:28:18       Oh sorry did. But I think it went to his head a little bit and maybe the ego got in the way and he kind of stopped listening to the coaches and it was evident in the walters fight, you know, he even said like, I stopped listening to my dad, I should have been listening to my dad on the corner and look what happened. You know, and I said this in the training camp, some people in his entourage. I said, you know what? He's not listening to me. He's not, he's coaching his dad like had to train him like, you know, this guy could potentially be one of the best boxers we've ever seen. If he just listened and I was at this rate, something's going to happen. He's going, they're going to get knocked out or he's going to get hurt and then everybody's going to snap it and they're going to say, hey, we should have fucking done this or we should've done that. You know what I mean? And now he's doing it. He's, he's back and he's dedicated

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       to late. How old is he now? He's 30. I think he's 31, but I have a really lightweight. He's fighting a 1:22 I think now. Right? Is that right? I think so killed. Did he like the guys in his division? He'll destroy them. Yeah, he started to. It just seems like that at that age, at the lower weight classes, age is like if he was 32 years old and he was fighting and heavyweight, I was like, oh, he's going to keep going. Yeah, I mean those. It seems like heavyweights mature later. Do you agree with that? Uh, you know, I don't know to be honest. Maybe I was wondering about that. Actually. One of the things I wanted to ask you about is it, is it because like a guy like vladimir klitschko, so just this massive person, I always wondered like, does it take longer to develop efficiency of movement and the ability to move your body better to understanding your body if you have more of it to, to learn. If you're, say if you're dealing with a much larger frame, much more body mass. Yeah. So is it more gravity? You're dealing with more gravity, you're dealing with the influence of that gravity. It slows you down. You're obviously slower in a lighter way person. Is it more difficult to develop mastery of skill?

Speaker 2:          01:30:14       Yeah, I think that's a good question, joel. I think there is some, maybe some truth to that. Like the length of the limb requires the leverage that you get on the muscles. It's going to be a lot greater. Like the torque you need to generate out of the smaller muscles to control the larger lamb. Of course, that's gonna play a big role, so the length of the limb can determine how much, how much force you can produce also, so it'll play a role on the mechanics. But I think uh, yeah, I think uh, I think it is maybe a little bit harder for some of those big guys just strictly like on the, on the, I don't know, maybe it's the relative strength, you know, I don't know. I really can't answer that. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:30:51       I always felt like they're just, they're dealing with more gravity. Like it seemed to me that like lighter weight guys, especially back in the kickboxing days, I had noticed that the lighter weight guys seem to learn quicker. They seem to pick up the skills quicker. There are obviously always faster

Speaker 2:          01:31:09       be a higher degree of relative strength to like your strength to bodyweight ratio. So, or

Speaker 1:          01:31:15       could have something to do with it because the other thing is you never see a guy at heavyweight that can move like mighty mouse, right? Like they just don't exist now. I mean, you look at, if you watch mighty mouse, demetrius johnson, the ufc flyweight champion, the guy who my opinion is best pound for pound fighter in the world. I think when it comes to taking the least amount of punishment, the ability to make great fighters look average, the ability to impose his skillset and never runs out of gas and is always technically he's always in the best position. He's always doing the right thing. Like he's really, really well trained. I don't, I've never seen a fucking heavyweight even remotely move like that. Like the best heavyweight in the world is cain velasquez obviously, and he's to beat purdue. It's

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       tough fight. Very tough fIght because his big strength is taking guys down, you know, take down. You're in a world of shit. Yeah. That guy is no joke off his back. His fucking guard is head and shoulders above anybody that cane has ever faced without a doubt. Absolutely. I don't know who he brought in to train with it, but they're not good enough. No. Who the fuck are you going to bring it? Unless you bring it in, you'd have to bring in a vinny magallanes, someone who is a go really and only specifically work the ground aspect of it because vinny can't hang with volume on the feet. Right. BecAuse hafez, al has done an amazing job of of taking those guys and turning them into kickboxers. I mean he's. He's just fucking. He's a master. Hockfield codero. One of the original guys for shoot box, the original brazilian berzerker camp at occurred t but Brazil are fucking animals, man.

Speaker 3:          01:32:51       They were just the most feared camp ever at the time, you know, but he's so smart and so skIllful at taking those like grapplers and turning them into elite strikers. You look at dosantos, you look at verdugo for doom out kickbox, travis fucking brown and chris travis brown's and animal, you know, you figure if we're doing is going to be travis browne was going to take them down, submit them, right? No, he kicked his ass standing. I mean that was crazy. Watch him double jab travis brown, you know, being that was crazy to watch. When you go back to his fight with junior dos santos or even before that, his fights and pride and you see the rudimentary striking he had back then and then you look at his abilities now. Pretty god damn impressive.

Speaker 2:          01:33:34       Cornell has a great striking coach and a humble guy too. Really, really nice.

Speaker 3:          01:33:40       He's a great guy. I love that dude. But if you. You look at the best fighters in the world, the two best guys, the two best guys in the heavyweight division currently the best of all time. I kinda gotta go with fader. I just think fade or. Yeah, I think he's the best of all time in the heavyweight division. I just don't, I mean maybe became with a beat him. I would've loved to seen them about the natural. Um, randy is really a light heavyweight and heavyweight. He was undersized. I mean he was a great, great fighter, but I think honestly, pound for pound, I just don't. I mean fado easily could have been two. Oh, five, two by the way. No, he waSn't a, it wasn't a like when you see a guy like that's carrying around all that extra fat, what do you think about that? Like cain carrIes around extra.

Speaker 2:          01:34:24       Yeah. Uh, I think as long, you know, again, that's, that's uh, doesn't matter, obviously not, but it does it mean, look, he's obviously a monster, but would it be better if he had very little muslin? No, not necessarily. No, because that goes back to what we're saying about the rate of force development and how, if you look how explosive fader is despite not being looking like hercules. Right, right. That goes back to what we're talking about, the rate of forced development and how the nervous system, you know, plays the greatest role In how much force you produce, so how explosive you are. He's an interesting case too, in that he started off his career early on. He was into heavy kettle bells, did a lot of lifting, and he was a thicker, bigger guy. And then as time went on, he, he talked about how he didn't lift weights anymore and he just relied on skill training.

Speaker 2:          01:35:18       He just would wrestle. And sambo and kickboxing and all that stuff. I don't remember you asking. I think I heard a show you're asking, you know, you're wondering what the russian guys are doing. Like these wrestling guys. I'm like, what are they doing for their conditioning? The truth is not much. They're not doing weights. a lot of them, they're just wrestling. I know this because a, I don't know if you know, I train aaron peko. Are you familiar with their agenda? Yeah. So he's one of my guys too. Um, so I trained him and he goes out there for months at a time and changes with the russians and the ukrainian national teams and he says, no, they're just wrestle. That's it. No strength and conditioning. Not really. Wow. What do you think? I'm gonna do some running and stuff like that. I think uh, well they've got great wrestlers.

Speaker 2:          01:35:58       So I would almost rather have that than have a detrimental thing. And they're like heavy weight lifting or something like that. So you'd have. Yeah. I would rather have them just focusing all their energy on their skill and doing some cardiovascular training. Have you ever seen the workouts that cain velasquez don't know how you want to throw up? Sure. Okay. Yeah. I don't mean a good way to say it out. Cain velasquez has some weight lifting routines that he has some guy working out with them. I showed it to steve maxwell. Steve maxwell got angry. Really? Yeah. Let's check it out. It's like got a video. Yeah. Show show I'm kettle bell swings. He's doing like really heavy kettle bell swings. I'm not lying. Maxwell got angry. You really get angry. Steve maxwell the kettlebell and master, rIght? Like I been do it for a long time now, but he's not just kettlebell master. He says like an overall fitness guru. He understands the human body. He's like a real student of all sorts of different modalities. Like watch this, watch this. He's got this giant kettle bell. Look at this.

Speaker 2:          01:36:59       He's like, kinda. It's almost like he's doing like tend is look at. It's not really a swing because he's kind of pulling it up more like a, like almost like a dead lift. yeah, I mean it's got got to make them stronger, but the lower back thing he's doing is not swing like he's popping it up. Right. Whereas every other kettle bell swing, you'll see. I just fell off. I don't. I have no idea how it's gonna help in the new ufc, ms.to make them stronger. I guess it's wrong or it's going to make them stronger at doing kettlebell. I bet about it lay some pipe like a motherfucker, see if he can find a correct technique. Double-handed kettlebell swing online, like maybe maxwell has a video or someone or mike mauler is very good at that and he. He's a. He's a great instructor as far as like proper fundamentals, but there's a bunch of those that he has.

Speaker 2:          01:37:54       Like one of them is leg extensions. I'll show you the cain velasquez leg extension one. You'll throw up at that one too because he's doing like 300 pounds. Leg extensions needs to happen. Crazy. Both shoulders blown out, shoulders repaired. See this guy, this guy's using three pounds. It's might not be the best guy to look at it, but this is how it's supposed to look. Right. He's popping his hips forward and the arm swings. That's why it's called the kettlebell swing phase two, like 10, 15 years ago. You were early adopter. Yeah. I love them. My favorite thing to work out with, you know what I like, uh, for an athlete I wouldn't have them do. Um, to be honest. Yeah. But for guys like you and me as we're getting older and I'm going to be 42, like I need to keep the muscle along a little bit.

Speaker 2:          01:38:41       So yeah, for general fitness, I don't think there's anything wrong. Performance wise. Like I said, the movement pattern there. You're sitting back on your heels, you're training. Excuse me. You're sitting back on your heels, you're training yourself to, to. I felt that affect me. Like I've been in that position where I've been training with guys and I'm like, fuck, why is this guy taking me down? I'm way better than this dude, but he's beating me to the punch every time because I was sitting back on my heels. I was in that kettlebell posture when I'm standing there, I'm standing there with my back then and my heels are flat on the ground. Why couldn't I get off my toes? Because I've trained my body to sit back on the heels. That's interesting. So you, your Body. I automatIcally went into that posture. Exactly. So you can retrain that though.

Speaker 2:          01:39:24       That's the good thing. It takes some time, but he trained the forefoot. So you're quick around. How many times have you heard it in sports? Man, these guys are on their toes now. They really looked great in there. You know? What do you think about like turkish getups from grappling? I'm a big fan of those. I just, I don't know how that plays into grappling. Just being able to lift heavy weight off of you, get up off your back, have that ct scan like, I don't know. I think at a high proof, really proficient level of jujitsu, you're not going to lift anything off. You're going to move around it. You know what I mean? like maybe the best shoulder stability, maybe. Does it help them that way? It's only going to help wherever, you know what I don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:40:03       This problem with my back and this guy gave me advice. This guy was a strength and conditioning coach to do a lot of windmills. He was like windmills, you know, kettlebell wind like dropping down like that and really good for stabilizing the spine, stabilized in the shoulder joint and you know that. Anything that is in the thoracic area, in the cervical area as well? Yeah. What do you think about neck exercises?

Speaker 2:          01:40:31       I love him. Do you think on like the neck bridging? I think that the desks are so small and the nac, that man I used to do like 45 pound plates on my chest and do the neck bridge is on the back of my head. Real. It's just stupid. I've got this exercising machine straps on your head. I mean you look like a retard, like isn't that a good way machine? Is that or is it a different thing? Yeah. Maybe I have a picture or something. I don't know if I have a picture on my instagram or not, but no, it's. What's it called? Do you call it halo? Oh, I've seen that. Have you got a strap under the chin and a velcro strap on the top and you pump it up with air and it's like this big metal thing. I mean you look, you look ridiculous wearing it and what do you do?

Speaker 2:          01:41:15       And you can exercise in all ranges of motion. It has like an elastic band that you'll attach to a wall so you can put just a little bit of tension, tension on it to see if we can find that. Jeremy. If not, I have a video on my phone. I don't know if he can show that on there but probably will. But it's pretty cool. If you could email it to him, he could show it. Don't give out no battery or though. No, you don't have a battery charger. So I'm sure that's an iphone. Yeah. It's. Or this thing. Is this it right here? A similar to that halo? No, this one is a little more hardcore than When I got this. about like seven or 800 bucks. Does it have a um, so it has a rubber band? yeah, it's got like a band attachment to that man, I think we're saying.

Speaker 2:          01:42:01       Yeah. And I'll show you. Is there a uh, there's a plug back there somewhere, but behind you. That's it right there. Oh, okay. Take this thing out. Oh, whoa. Look at this fucking thing spaceship looking thing. yeah. okay. So this, I really rotates around. He can hit every angle. Okay. And that's the pump up a little. So you put it on. Oh, I have seen this. Okay. I've seen this very video. So he has this thing on and it's just a rubber band. That's the resistance. Yeah, exactly like that. Or you can use it with like a, like, uh, wait, uh, so he's moving his head, in fact running around in a circle. Yeah. So you can exercise at all different angles. What is the resistance though? Is the resistance the spinning of his head? So is it pulling a. It's a combination of the two, so looks like.

Speaker 2:          01:42:53       So if you see it's pulling right there, he'll be exercising the side of his head. If he faces it, he'll be exercised in the back of his neck. Excuse me, on the back side of his neck that he looks like he's got a steel cable, like he's doing a lat pull. Yeah, he's probably got it hooked up to like a cable machine, but I have a guy on training right now. We're actually, he's actually going to Mexico next week for a title fight, but he put on two inches in the last month published because that good great. One hundred, eight pounds with a 16 inch neck. She has christ. It's called the iron neck dynamic neck strengthening rotary cable attachment gives pointers as he takes a college football player through the iron neck. Basic workout. Huh? So you have this guy, he puts this exact thing on that you got right here. And then what do you have them do with this similar stuff to what you just saw right there, like rotational exercises other than the neck. Uh, and it's all like circular movements, all different movements. And that

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       doesn't fuck with the discs or anything because it's a very lightweight. Well yeah, if you're going to go on there and put like 80, 90 pounds, 100 pounds or something. And what do you think about those traditional ones that people use those leather things and I'm not a big fan of them and I think because it's too, it's too linear and again, you don't really get the, the stretch out of the muscle. It's just like an isotonic contraction. So that's just the same weight going up and down over and over right now, would you recommend something like that to somebody who had a neck injury? They're trying to, you know what? I think actually I believe they use them at the disc institute or the spine, the, the place in la, you know, marina del rey, the spine or whatever disk or something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:44:32       Yeah, I think they have it there. So they use that for rehabilitation? I believe so, yeah. Because there's a lot of um, different. Uh, kelly started again. I hate to bring him up again, but he, he, uh, he hates a lot of these machines that are out there. I like those machines where you can say neck flexion, extension and all that stuff. You hate those things too. I don't hate, but I just don't use them. Yeah, I think it's to the pattern of the movement is to linear, it's not efficient enough for like sports and stuff, right. So it doesn't mimic how you would use the neck in real life. Seemed like a squat or maybe a bench press, you know what I mean? So I think if there would be a way to strengthen your neck up, that would be really crucial for striking sports.

Speaker 2:          01:45:16       Anything where your head's getting jolted back more than it should. And then the endurance of the neck as like, you know, you're in a longer bout, you know, it's, you can't resist anymore and pop your head flies back. Absolutely kind of doing their thing has been shown to reduce concussion. Like the damage from head injuries. Sure. So that line, we use that frequently. You can do it also with like an exercise ball, you can put it against the wall and roll, roll your head against it, you know, there's a lot of different ways you can use a towel. And so, I mean I've got a lot of different modalities I use. Um, but yeah, we, we, we, we really focus with roselawn like durability for this training to really building the abdominals and the obliques and lower back and the neck. And what do you, what kind of exercises do for the abdominals?

Speaker 2:          01:46:02       Yeah, I like the, we call it the horse, but the glute ham machine can do a lot of abdominal exercises on there. You can like the russian twist. I like that exercise. I like a lot of medicine ball, rotational medicine ball throws. So the glute ham machine, you're like leaning back. So yeah, I back on the, the big pattern. Exactly. That one. Yeah. Why do you, why do you like that one particularly? Uh, it's, it's pretty versatile I think for, for how basic it is, I think it's pretty versatile as far as like the amount of exercises and the, the how specific you get with each muscle group. Like if I want to target your obliques, like I can hit that oblique so easily just by turning your hip a certain way, you know what I mean? And I can find all these little weak areas in the abdominals and the feet lock in on sort of a similar way to like an old school like sit up bench.

Speaker 2:          01:46:52       Yeah, exactly. And when you do house those old school set up benches of those, you know, and I don't think so. I think you can get some good work done on those. Believe it or not, like yeah, I'm not, but they're not as good as the uh, no, my preferences is the glue. I like that better. That's the glute ham. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And that's, that's a guy facing forward. You haven't faced backwards as well. Go both ways. Yeah. Lower back. You want to get back in there and, and um, and that machine seems like it would give you some spinal decompression as well. It's phenomenal for, for the lower back. And, and is that guy holding a weight in his chest when he's doing that? If you look up that those two guys doing on the right, they're banging what to do it. If you're in a bad guy.

Speaker 2:          01:47:34       Yeah. What the fuck is that? That's the same guy. Two different phases. Yeah. Yeah. I know. It's kind of banging his buddy. That's how you do it. It was pretty interesting. You know how that was a, you know how the machine was invented was the russians took a pommel horse and they moved it up to the law. They took a two by four on the wall and they just put their feet on the wall and back extensions over it. No shit. Yeah. Pretty cool. Huh? That is pretty cool. Have you seen the reverse hyper? Uh, yeah, I have. What do you think about that? Uh, I think it's good. I think there's one of those back there. I love that thing. Yeah. I think there's some. Is that better? Do you think through the glute ham? I think the way you do the exercise is the most important.

Speaker 2:          01:48:16       That's the key to what's cool about the reverse. Hyper is on the descending. It's, it's got like an active decompression. It's like releasing. Oh, is that right? Yeah. Well you feel. Yeah. Yeah. Like fully on your lower back slightly and then you lifting up and strengthening all that. Yeah. So now this like for sports performance, the speed of which you do that would be a crucial factor. You want to feel the stretch out of the tendons and ligaments before it fires back up and the weight that you would put on it. How much weight put on. Maybe maybe start off with two and a half pound ankle weights first. Real. Yeah. See it, you know, and just build it up. So you would explode up lower down. I don't load guys up with weight unless the quality and the speed of the movement and the speed will not be compromised.

Speaker 2:          01:49:02       So if that's compromised and there's no sense in moving it up, for me it's all about getting the guy faster. I'm producing more forced. So. So do you, when you have a guy like dos anjos and you obviously got them in incredible shape, do you incorporate any traditional exercises that people are familiar with? Like say hill sprints or sand bags or anything and he'll like, he'll sprinting is kind of like old school, you know, like I used to do that shit like crazy, but fuck man, I pushed myself to the limit. Like, oh my heart rate's like 190. Wow. I'm really pushing it out. $100. But it slows you down. You just sprinting should be for done, for speed again. So running up a hill. Why would you try to go fast? You're, you're running against resistance, you're making yourself slow. It's actually been shown that it's proven.

Speaker 2:          01:49:50       You can look this up on the strength and conditioning manuals, whatever. That a downhIll ski, downhill sprinting has been shown to increase the top speed and sprinters performance downhill because decelerating that because because it's forcing your body to adapt to a higher speed. You know what I mean? So instead you're going up hills, you're forcing your body to adapt to a slower speed, but you feel like you're going to fucking face plant at any moment. Right. I think the biggest misconception with all the resistance type training is that somehow you're going to put the weight down and you're going to move faster, right? People believe that, but why? Because you can lift the heavier weight and so your muscles are stronger. It makes you faster at exactly that. it doesn't work that one out. it doesn't work that way. some sort of a study on power lifters that they found out the power lifters that increase their, their ability to do vertical leaps and all sorts of other different explosive exercises just because of power lifting.

Speaker 2:          01:50:47       there might be some truth to that and olympic lifting as well. They found their good sprinters, but you would say that that strengthening of the feet, uh, I'd say that has a lot to do with it, but also the strength of the quadriceps and relation to the, you know, the lag in relation to the rest of the body. But how do they Move laterally? How do they move rotationally that's where they're deficient. Well, when you see a really big bulky guy in the ufc becomes super obvious when they fight, a guy who can move moves real good. They're almost like stuck in mud. Exactly. You know, when you seat, but for some guys like their style, but like who's smart? Paul harris, you know, he's a guy where that big beefy fucking build he always tried to do is grab a hold of your leg and rip it apart.

Speaker 2:          01:51:31       So it's like, it's almost for him it seems to benefit him to be like really over muscular and super strong because he's, he's about that very small movement or they're very small group of movements rather. It's pretty interesting because I'm actually training another guy from the ufc. I just started working with him aBout a month ago. Ricardo dementia. A braille cyborg. No, ricardo, ricardo brain. He's this guy is another really good jujitsu guy from Brazil, but this guy is on the ufc a, I don't know how many fights he has now. Maybe this will be the second or third. I think he's Pretty new. I think of a cyborg or fighting on the june. Sixth garde. I think there's one, right? Uh, probably the fight night. Yeah. Yeah. He's fighting on that one. Oh, there he is. Yeah. That's him. How many fights in the ufc a? Just want one fight night.

Speaker 2:          01:52:25       rear naked choke. He fight what nurse? Okay. He's another guy. I mean you look at this guy and he's just like freakishly bill. He was in the Brazil card, the meo chick versus maldonado car. Really good jujitsu to the hydro gracie and all those guys and it's like really? But he is classic case of a guy who's lifting. I mean he's huge but just ripped a. he's lifting all these heavyweights slowly. Hey, I got them out to their first day sprinting. I couldn't believe how slow forgot was slower. Molasses. Blew my freaking mind. Here's this gigantic muscle bound guy and the guy couldn't. It looked like he was jogging. really? Yeah. I take it slow because you thought you're going to torture him. Now did go slow to get that time and then I have them do like a, like a throw off, like what I showed you with the plyometric bench press type movement, like maybe like 45 pounds, right?

Speaker 2:          01:53:21       Guy can barely throw it off six inches. Really? Yeah. Because his muscles are trained to be short and slow here. So the body remembers the movement pattern and the speed, not just, you know what I'm saying? So you're training slow twitch and now already a month later, like getting huge gains. Getting explosive. Like friday was a breakthrough day, you know, a month later. Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah. That's interesting. So you would take a guy like that. He's a good example. Fic fairy, obviously fricking huge. Right? Right. Yeah. So what do you do with a girl like that? Like what's the first thing you do? First thing I do is get a moving dynamic movements, getting him to move a little quicker on his feet, learning how more coordination exercises but keeping him loose and dynamic rather than anything that's tense and going to tighten them up. So like even the shadow boxing a month ago, it was just like, like it looks like slow motion now.

Speaker 2:          01:54:17       It looks, it looks pretty good. Like that's amazing. You can do such so much progress or make so much progress happen in such a short period of time. Yeah, it is. And uh, yeah, it's really, it's, I'm not gonna say it was easy because this is one of the harder cases. Usually it takes about two weeks before I start seeing a difference. But uh, but no, once you get that breakthrough and you start seeing them moving differently and quicker, man, it's, it's on from there it's like okay, now we can start really progressing and hitting the nervous system with really like intense plyometrics and stuff like that. How cutting edge is this style of training? I mean marinovich did he invent all tests or marv? Marv did was, he took a scientific studies from, from what the russians had developed back during the cold war period and he translated into his, his exercises.

Speaker 2:          01:55:05       And so I'd say at least 80 percent of what I'm doing is stuff that he's come up with 80 percent. Yeah, maybe 75, 80. Yeah. But something like that. And how did you do? Did you do like an internship with him? Like how to do that and even if it's not what he's doing, it's something along the lines, you know, it's something similar. It's very heavily influenced by what the russians came up with and their studies of the nervous system. And uh, so mark took these things and translated in exercises and it's just been phenomenal. Like, you know, it's just, it's really, uh, he got to try it, man. I, I believe you can work out with me for two weeks. I changed your life, but you're way the fuck down

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       there. Where are you? I'm in woodland hills. Oh look, you're here right now. Burbank. We're all. Well, let's do this. Okay. Do it. I would love to. I would love to. Your life. You're a guy with an open mind. He'd be blown away at the differences. Well, I would love to just from the point of view, first of all for a person always, I'm always trying to work on, you know, different things and improve different things about my performance physically, but I also as a commentator, I think it would help. I figured that's one thing I really liked joe, is how you've educated the fat and this is something I think maybe boxing needs a little bit more of is like educating the fans on the different techniques and strategies of the fighters. You remember that one fight? I think it waS who was anderson silva and the crowd was bullying.

Speaker 1:          01:56:29       I think it was anderson facility one and crowds bullying. You're like, why are you building? That was like a great performance, like fucking strategic performance. Well I loved floyd mayweather versus pack. Yeah. He didn't know. Yeah, I mean I love skill. Yeah. I mean very important to me. I didn't love it. I respect it. Like I respect me whether skill. Like he's a phenomenal boxer. I just would've liked to see it for 200 million bucks. Like go for the kill. Did you know that guy's tired on the twelfth round? Put a little something out there for the fans. I, I loved it, but I didn't love it as much as I love canelo alvarez. James kirkland. that was more or matisa and provide the cost. That was more my mean, that was definitely more crazy and watch one of my favorite fights of all time in the ufc.

Speaker 1:          01:57:12       I mean there's been a few favorite fights, but dan henderson versus shogun, which was just phenomenal. I just watched that the other day, man. Oh my god. I couldn't be brain damaged just watching it. The other one I watched the other day was the don frye bush versus a takiyama that exchange, two of them were in the corner and we're just color tie haymaker haymaker out of his eyeball. Man. that was insanity. I love that. That was crazy. Some of those pride fights were fucking absolutely nuts. But um, I'm a fan of skill. Like that's why I said mighty mouse is like one of my favorite guys to watch. But vanderbilt is probably my all time favorite, although vendor skillful. What I loved about vandelay, which juSt you knew you're going to see some fucking chaos and that guy got in and started rolling his knuckles.

Speaker 1:          01:58:00       You're going to see some shit. I'm so happy that he got that lifetime ban rescinded and I don't know whether or not he was on. I don't know what the fuck he was on, but I do know that the vast majority of those guys are doing something to help them recover in and when you take a guy and you take away his livelihood forever, you see you can never fight again. That to me is just disgusting. It's disgusting. You can't do that to come lead to right. Or then they send it back or something. No, they were going to give him a one year, so suspended a one year suspension. They were going to give him nine months and they tried to shift it to one year. He had agreed to nine months and then when they try to shift it to one year, that's when he started hearing

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       all these people on the internet that were saying that the tests that they did were not proper, couldn't handle either ms dot handled or what it wasn't. The protocol wasn't estaBlished. So what the ufc did is they kind of overstepped their ability, you know, like if you're going to have someone get tested, you really have to have some water type organization come in and handle it. People that have been doing that forever, the people that handle the testing did not do the best job so that the results were in question. They would not have probably held up in court and the ufc had a stand down and so now calmly is involved in some crazy lawsuit with the ufc and he's a part of the whole class action lawsuit thing. But I think he was also kind of on his way out. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          01:59:26       I think it's a bit of a money grabbing certain ways. But I think, um, the, the bisping fight was, it was an interesting fight because con looked great. It was ripped, chiseled, and that's why people are like, what the fuck is going on with that guy? What is he up to? He gets these tests, the results in question, but the tests apparently showed very high growth hormone rates, like unusually high. But yeah, when the tests are in question, I'm obviously not a doctor or a scientist. I don't know what the fuck really happened. Guy looked awesome at 40 something for the first time I ever talked to jack.

Speaker 2:          02:00:03       Pretty good transformation. Kind of like a one one mark as when he fought. Pack out that. Yes. Yeah. That was an interesting one too. Same gym or something was packet. I was guy packing. I was old guy. Alex.

Speaker 3:          02:00:17       There's a lot of that going on. You know what, when you hear okay, we kind of talked about this slightly but you didn't touch on it. There was a bunch of like Bobby Green was accusing hockfield hassan joe's fighters high level fighter in the ufc lightweight division. What's he ranked? You know, he's highly ranked. Is he? Yeah, he's, if he's not 10 or top 15, I don't know what rank is, I'll find out, but he's a very good fighter, but he, his, I think he's exact quotes were pedes got played by a ped cheat. That's what he said. That's interesting. But it's just speculation right? Immediately.

Speaker 2:          02:00:52       Yeah. The referral trained with, I don't know, one I think and I think they train together, didn't he told me about a guy running his mouth and then he came up to raphael was all humble. I wanted to train with them and then they started training. the guy was complaining, don't kick me here. Don't keep me there. Oh reAlly? Yeah. It's, I think it's the same guy. Hmm. But uh, what do I think about that? You know, I think the guy, if he's not top three and he's saying that he's probably just trying to make a name for himself and um, it's pretty disrespectful to rafael, but it's kind of complimentary to me. LIke, okay, cool. It's like stuck anything. It's that good. All right. Come on, sign up. See what the body does not look that much different. It doesn't look. If you're a, you know, if you're juicing, you're going to have traps up to your ears.

Speaker 2:          02:01:35       You're going to look like a freak people out. I always look at lance armstrong, lance armstrong, but he's taken epl. You just take an epo and testosterone and a bunch of other things as well. Yeah, I called cocktail wrote to be honest, I'm not that educated on this stuff, but I'll tell you this, if I've got him at 12,000, 500 feet altitude doing sprints, I'm not going to have. I'm going to make damn sure he's clean. Cause if you're taking any kind of stuff, I don't know what the hell that could do to your body and your blood up or something like that and you want to keep you. Yeah, absolutely. Could you imagine that? And then and then you're taking 12,000 feet, that's like ridiculous. Bobby green or whoever you are, come and go through a workout and See what he does and then you'll see why he's the best.

Speaker 2:          02:02:13       Do you think that this sport has an issue? I mean, it seems to at least a perception that there's an issue with ped. Do I think it does. I'm sure there is. I'm sure there's an issue. Why do you think that exists? Do you think would exist because of improper training or because guys want to get an edge. I think that man, joe, if you and I are trying to reach for that cup of coffee and you take something and I and I know you took it and I want the coffee, I'm going to take it to if I need, it's going to give me a benefit. Right. It's totally understandable if if one guy, if you don't have proper training and you feel slow and you need to take some shit to to feel stronger, you're going to do it because you know the other guys doing it.

Speaker 2:          02:02:53       You know what I mEan? Like what did you. What did you think about the whole testosterone replacement therapy debacle? Which I think is a real debacle. I think the way they handled it was just ridiculous. They gave it to people. They allowed it for a few years. You had these staggering perform like [inaudible] is the poster boy for, for testosterone replacement. You know what I think if it's a medical thing and like you've been to a doctor and they say, hey, did this, is it? I think if it's regulated to the point where it doesn't put you above an average level of testosterone, then I don't see what, how it should be a problem to you. I mean what benefits you? It gives you more quicker. Recovery allows you to train harder. Right? But I'm saying as long as it's not above an average level, so if you're deficient, let's say your total testosterone was 100 and the doctors are moderate, like they're monitoring it thoroughly and you show up every week and they're doing a test and they can show like, hey, this is his thing and it's 300.

Speaker 2:          02:03:45       That's it. Then I don't know if that would be. I'm not condoning drugs, but I'm just saying maybe that would be an acceptable way to let it in. I agree with you. In a perfect world, I think there's too many variables. If your testosterone is low, you probably shouldn't be a fighter. Yes. And also probably it's inter indicative of one or two things, pituitary gland damage or, or gonad damage or you took steroids and now you're not producing. Yeah. And your body shut down. And that's, uh, that's, that's what a lot of guys were doing. They were taking it. And then when you, when you add in exogenous, as I say it, I guess I'm testosterone. Your body goes, all right, we've got plenty of this and it stops. It's natural production. And so then you would do that and then go get tested. And then the doctor would say, oh, your natural production is way down.

Speaker 2:          02:04:34       Way down Testosterone. Yeah. And that's what a lot of guys were getting away with it. You don't need it with a great diet. Like raphael liked the guy saying that I don't know who he is, but you have to understand there's a reason he's the champion and it starts with his mind and his discipline and his dedication to the fighting. He came here with nothing. Did like, uh, his diet is impeccable. His training is impeccable. I mean, he drives two hours to train with media. That's dedication, like do all the pds and what you want. If you're not willing to make those sacrifices to beat him, like the same sacrifice that he makes, you're not going to beat him. so when he goes down and train with you, how many days a week does he do this for? Three to four days. Three to four days, depending upon how he's.

Speaker 2:          02:05:19       Sometimes I'll go down there. Yeah, exactly. Or how he feels, you know, sparring so really hard. Or he's got something in the next day, you know, that we'll take it off. but yeah, I really think it's kind of disrespectful to him. Did he put in so much work? How many? Five flights in the last year or something like that, but six training camps. When you look at the guyS who's beaten to eating some table guys. Exactly. And towards the end we're not going to lie. It started to take its toll. I'm looking at a partial tear of the mcl. He was getting worn down and now he really needed a break. So the other thing is the guy walks around with like one 81 probably about [inaudible] 91 93. Yeah. You've seen him wiTh the weight cuts, you see how holly macerated, he is the guys fighting in an aca state.

Speaker 2:          02:06:00       He's probably fighting about one 72, maybe [inaudible] 73 when he fight night. So imagine you take a guy who's one night and strip off 20 pounds. Of course he's going to look ripped and lean like we all look like that underneath, you know. So these accusations are kind of like, they're very disrespectful I think. But people think it because we have the stamina, stamina for sure. He's just, he's just a monster. You know, when, whenever you see someone who excels at a very high level, people go, hmm, how's he doing? I do that too. Like I questioned some guys too, like there's some guys in the ufc I question and it's because their bodies have changed a lot over time, you know what I mean at the time. But uh, there's some guys you look At it and go, okay, what, like, what did hector lumbar tested positive?

Speaker 2:          02:06:43       Nobody went, what? No, that doesn't even make sense. Right? Hector lumbered had muscles that weren't even in books. You go like medical books and they go, what the fuck is that? What does that. ThAt is not even a human muscle. What? I don't even understand what drug he would need to take to. How like raphael, I don't even know what drug he would need to take to have great stamina. That's easily trainable. The problem is all these guys are doing such improper training that they're making me look even better. You know what I mean? So if you took a guy that had poor stamina, like okay, let's take bj penn. Bj was on pds when he fought diego santa. No. Why? Why watch this training and. Well first of all, beaches, one of those guys. That was only a few guys. Yeah, he wouldn't even take an fucking ivy for the frankie edgar fight and wouldn't even rehydrate with an iv, which I think is crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:07:32       Huh? But beach is one of those guys where I don't think he's done anything ever. I don't either. I don't think he would either. Why do people think raphael house? Because he's brazilian. You know, that's one reason. Not like the most handsome dude in the world. Sorry, raphael, what are you trying to say? No, but you know what I mean. He's not going to be on the cover of a wheaties box. Like, yeah, he's from Brazil. The dude comes here to fight. I mean, he's a fighter. That's how fighters look. Sorry. You know? Yeah. Well, I mean he'S obviously done it. Even if he had done any sort of ped, there's no fucking ped in a world that makes you that good. No, that's hard work. Hard work and dedication. One hundred percent. Not only that, but they did blood and urine testing for the fight. No.

Speaker 2:          02:08:14       you know what I mean? Like I think it was three weeks out from the fight like. Right, right. And then they did urine testing after urine. I mean they can detect some stuff. From what I understand, like I'm not a master of mexicans supplements, but I know a little bit. And so, uh, yeah. I don't know, I just keep bringing the compliments man. I like it. So if you took a guide, like a guy that was known for not having the best stamina in the world, the guy who fades, um, how much time would you need to get him to a point where he had a fight? Like say he's fighting a title fight, like it's taking a guy who's a known. Here's a good example, tyron woodley was one of the best, 170 pound fires and world carries a lot of muscle memory. Right?

Speaker 2:          02:08:53       He'll get tyron. He's fucking huge. I mean, it's amazing. That guy makes one 70 and they're guys yoked as fuck. And when he gets in the cage, I don't know how much it weighs, but it ain't one 70. Right. You know, and he's known for being very fast, very strong in the first round, but slows down a little bit in the second one. Right. How much time would you need with a guy like that? And what would your advice be to a big muscular guy like that? Three weeks? probably about three weeks. I think that's it. Yeah. I can probably get them gone through weeks. Three weeks. How come you only need that much time? Uh, I'm just kind of trying to base that off of like past experiences. I'd say about three weeks to get them ready for about five rounds.

Speaker 2:          02:09:33       He might struggle a little in the fifth round, but you made a full training camp with a guy. He'll do like seven or eight rounds. Heart, no problem. Seven, eight were not humble. What is a full training camp for you? Look, if you. Ideally roughly eight weeks. So if you had a guy and you wanted to get a guy to the best possible shape for five rounds, he say he's going to be fighting robbie lawler for the title. You've got to go five rounds through fucking hell. How long would it take? It depends who it is and again, what he's had in the past. So I'd have to assess them first. So if you give me a guy who's got good cardio and he, his stamina has been in, his stamina is not known for stamina. He's not known for selling. I could have him ready for probably like four or five weeks.

Speaker 2:          02:10:15       then once you take a guy like that who's got a lot of extra muscle, I'm sorry, I'm sorry to interrupt, but again, he did have to prioritize that in this training, so something else might have to be substituted it because training energy systems is very taxing. So let's say we're doing sprints or we're doing something to train the energy systems one day. Then he might have to shorten his wrestling. He did. He'd have to be willing to make a sacrifice, shortened his wrestling. You know what I mean? yeah. You've got to find a, an even trade off where you don't compromise, um, all the aspects of the, of the, of what the athlete needs. So the skills, the skill work almost takes second place. If the guy's conditioning is bad, you have to look at the athlete as a whole. So if the guy sucks at wrestling, but he's got great stamina, then you need to devote more time to the wrestling or striking a fist striking socks.

Speaker 2:          02:11:06       and he's good at jujitsu and he's good at wrestling. He's got no stamina. Then you've got to devote your time to this a little more time to the stamina and the striking. They try to build that up, but again, with the skill, there's only so much you can do on a train in one training camp that's more like a year long process. No. Do you hook you guys up with nutritionists? If they don't have one? Do you have someone that you know, you don't. Usually they have their own guys and but if they asked me then I'll help him, you know what I mean? But you know, I'm not a licensed nutritionist or anything like that, but an older they're raphael's use and george lockhart who's getting kind of popular and he's pretty happy with him and I think ricardo's using him to. A lot of these guys, they get their meals prepped way in advance.

Speaker 2:          02:11:45       They get them in like little tupperware boxes and they keep them in the fridge and then heat them up before each meal. Son some girl or something like that. They delivered to your house. Oh really? Yeah. There's one son foods or something like that. They can deliver and it's all athlete prepared stuff they can do. They can. You can tell him what you want and got like a menu or something like that. I think. I think it's called sun foods or something because I would think that the more things you could take out of the athlete's mind that they have to think about the more happy sources they have. Right? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:12:18       How did one marina ventures when they developed this sort of style of training? Was this met with skepticism? Still is. Still is. Yeah. There's going to be a lot of haters on the comments on youtube. I don't know. I'm sure. Chance squat. What do you mean you can't do a dead lift? You know what I mean? Like unless you can prove it, show us that the proof in what you're saying. Like we, we already know the proof is out there. You just have to to, to, to read the fine tax of the nervous system training. You know the, the records that they have on the nervous system training. I mean, I think my theory is that this whole thing with the weight lifting came about because they needed like a universal measurement, you know what I mean? Like they needed to be able to put a number on improvement and so they would use weights because it's universal so that can kind of show regardless of whether or not it's good for sports.

Speaker 2:          02:13:11       It's just showing an improvement in strength. You know what I mean? That's before they have all the fancy monitors. Athletes in the us now are gravitating farther and farther away from weight lifting. A lot of the football guys, they do it because they have to. They don't like to do it. They don't like the way it makes them feel. The boxers hate it. Like I haven't met a boxer yet that has told me, yeah, I want to hit the weights. They don't like it because it makes them too stiff and it makes them to slow. Marquez was lifted in a lot of weights for their pacquiao fight when they showed that 24 slash seven or whatever the fuck hbo corner. So what it is 24 slash seven. When they showed his routine, I mean a lot of it was like weight, like weight lifting, dumbbells, heavy dumbbells.

Speaker 2:          02:13:48       Yeah. Pretty crazy. Yeah. Yeah. But he wasn't clean for that. I mean it's just. No, it's just like I showed it looked like a 24 year old beach model man. You know what I mean, like 41 mexican, you know, like been through wars, like, you know what I mean? It's like you guys shut up. That was ridiculous. I mean, yeah. And it might be. That might've been a fight. We're packed. Y'all was cleaned for the first time, you know. Well there was always a lot of speculation about him as well. Right. And then, you know, he found jesus in a very deep and meaningful way for awhile. Right. And his body changed a little bit. His body changed quite a lot of divisions. It will, the titles, different ways. Divisions. That's pretty crazy. Yeah. And kept his knockout power all the way up to. That's just about it actually hasn't knocked anyone out though in the last what, five yeaRs or something like that or like, I don't have any many.

Speaker 2:          02:14:40       You got to be thinking about who he's fighting. No fighting world class competition. You guys are very different. Very difficult to hit me in the last big k. I was like, what? Ricky hatton. YEah, but he fucked up. Chris algieri. I mean he knocked him down. That was pretty badly hurt. He looked great in that fight. Chris algieri though. He's, he's got it. Some balance issues and his feet and this I can tell and it doesn't buy. Absolutely. You know, you can tell by looking at a guy's caps. So the gas, the two calf muscles on the side of the other calf right there. If they're really underdeveloped, the guys, chances are the guys got poor balance [inaudible] let's do it. Sort of fast twitch muscles that control your balance. So like packouts footwork is fricking amazing, right? You see the size of his cast or watermelons. Exactly.

Speaker 2:          02:15:24       So that plays a crucial role iN lateral movement and footwork. So he took a guy. You look at one more kids, doesn't have great footwork, but have you seen his kaz? They're like noodles. What about jon jones? Jon jones is another guy. He's really skinny cow. He doesn't have very good footwork. He's quick, His upper body is quick and he's got quick leg kicks, but he doesn't have the greatest footwork, I don't think. Really? Yeah, I don't think so. Rafael has pretty good footwork now. He's in and out real quick. You know what I mean? You see thAt in the henderson fight? For sure. For sure. Yeah. Uh, who else? Pianist. I haven't been following the ufc that much. Your work with dos anjos is what got me excited about talking to you. have a lot of fighters started contacting, you know, I've been contacted by a lot of guys, you know, I'm very like, uh, I'm, I'm very choosy about who I trained.

Speaker 2:          02:16:14       So only so many hours in the day. not only that, but there's, there's Different personalities, man. It's, it's exhausting. Like guys, you don't want to listen or they don't want to have time for that anymore. I'm done with that. Like I did that in the beginning. I did a lot of shit and had to deal with it. Now it's like, if I sense right off the bat, you're not serious. I'm just, we're done. And that's how the marinovich is treated. Bj and the sec. This camp with frankie, I think. Yeah, but I think, you know, miriam is really cared about bj. Dude, it's, it's a funny thing when you're working with a guy that close you really get attached to them. You really care about their wellbeing and I think they took it aS kind of like a, like an insult and kinda like, almost like a, like, um, almost like a stab in the back when he questioned their, their, their intelligence as far as training goes, like, you know, their, their programming, the way they programmed the training camp.

Speaker 2:          02:17:06       So I think that, I think they were hurt by that, you know, to this day. I mean, gary and marv, you know, if he talked to them, uh, they're still saying, you know, I just can't figure out why he, he had it. He, he, he knew how he felt after the training. And why would you get rid of it? Why was hard, you know, it's also when you're that good and you have so many. Yes, men around you. That's the problem. It's very hard. That's the biggest problem I was staying in Hawaii, man. All the hawaiians is gonna. Hate me now, but stay in Hawaii. The reason why I stayed in Hawaii because Hawaii is fucking awesome. Fucking great. Don't get me wrong. I wouldn't just do the same training partners over and over. That's just monotony kills athletes. It does and also being the baddest motherfucker in the room has to be.

Speaker 2:          02:17:50       Yeah, you got to be challenged. Even here with the root ca training when they're at the root of training camp for the diego sanchez and we had amazing guys in there, like I was in there training with them everyday. A benson henderson was in there for an escadera who just won the ultimate fighter that year. A lot of other guys, division one wrestlers. Bj just tore through everybody like they are nothing. I didn't see one person. You get the better of him. Wow. Imagine a cage filled with like 15 of these intense, like hardcore lightweights and bj just walking through all of them. His timing was so precise. Elastic energy in his muscles, he elastic strength that he had his explosive power was just remarkable. His take down the fence when he was at his very best was absolutely retarded too. He'd be able to hop around on one leg.

Speaker 2:          02:18:35       I mean it just is. Flexibility is ridiculous. I tried to take him down many times to no avail. Look kind of flexibility to that guy. Have ridiculous dynamic flexibility. He'd do a lot of stuff with like rubber straps and stuff. Pulling on them and resisting and stretching this camp. He was doing all the same stuff that basically that I'm doing, you know, that I do in my guys like the dynamic stretching, you know the, a lot of the exercises on the stability ball and workouts in the pool. Stuff they use for rehabilitation, but you can progress that and use it for performance as well. So if it's good for rehabilitation, you know, you take it to another level, it's got to be good for performance. What is your education background when it comes to this stuff? I went to continuation school and high school, got obsessed with weird things. That's about It. It's continuation school, you know, you get kicked out of high school to go to like had to go to continuation

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       school. I didn't, I've never heard that before. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:19:31       you have an informal background training background. You know, it's funny. Mark did to marv. Marv majored in fine arts from usc. Really? Yeah. And that was my, that was my major in junior college was fine. Arts and psychology,

Speaker 1:          02:19:45       so everything you learn, you sort of learn along the way from reading studies and data.

Speaker 2:          02:19:51       Rehabilitating my own body after the car accident that waS, that was big. I went to supposedly the best physical therapists in the area and six months later I've got a huge bill and no results so I just took it into my own hands, started researching it, I now what to do and then within a month or two I'm, I'm already back at work on. Great. So then how long have you been training fighters now? How many fighters? You know, like a before I started training the fighters and strictly doing conditioning, you know, I was also working with like football athletes in soccer. I've got A ton of college athletes, you know, I don't think I can talk about them because the ncaa rules or whatever, you can't use them for reference from promotion. Exactly. But um, some pretty high level ones, a lot of high school athletes, but prior to that I had a jujitsu academy also. And um, so I was always, I've always been in the mix with like the jujitsu scene and mac, stuff like that. So then I just had so much more success with the conditioning that I had just gone that direction.

Speaker 1:          02:20:50       Well, one of the things I like about this conversation is there really is no straight consensus about what's the right way to train athletes and fighters and especially fighters. I think when it comes to strength and conditioning fighters, I think did, it is probably the most varied. I mean I think the nfl kind of has an idea of how to train football players. The nba players train very similar fashion, bUt with the fighters man, it's across the meanness. It saw the cain velasquez, cain velasquez, that motherfucker on the planet and you saw what he's going through. And I want to see his leg extensions now. Yeah, you do pull up cain velasquez leg extension 100 pounds. I'm just wondering how good this guy could be with good training. Yeah. You know what I mean? Well, he's got great wrestling training and great kickbox training conditioning. Let me say that. I'm just wondering how good he can be. Like with that. His fucking conditioning is. his stamina is insane. But his speed and his

Speaker 2:          02:21:46       coordination. I don't know. Maybe it can be even at another level. Who knows? Wow. You know what I mean? Let's put it this way to this.

Speaker 4:          02:21:54       Oh look at this.

Speaker 1:          02:21:59       Three hundred pounds on the lakes extension machine. What do you think about this? So it's nice getting help. I don't know what that's going to help. I don't know what it's going to build up his quads. I guess. I don't know what part of your extension on muslim, I don't know. Desire to help, like throw leg kicks or anything now it's just all caveman shit he looking at. This is not even cave man.

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       This is like nautilus, like jack lalaine type stuff. I used to work at a place that I used to teach people how to do that. Yeah. I worked at a place called the boston athletic club in south boston to teach people how to lift weights.

Speaker 2:          02:22:40       Yeah. Uh, so when I see that, I just wonder how much better they could be. Good training. I mean, I know, I know it works. I've been around this stuff for 15, 20 years, you know, strength and conditioning and seeing what works and it just, I know it works like marv to him and his brother combined. Seventy years of experience, maybe more. Maybe it's 80 now and they've seen everything. Marv was one of the guys responsible for designing the combine, the football combine, you know, for about 40 years ago. Amazing. Yeah. So he's seen everything to argue with him about it would be just ridiculous. Like you're way out of your league, you know, it's like talking to helio gracie about jujitsu, like there's nothing you're going to bring to the table that he hasn't seen, you know, despite all the monstrous monster stories that you hear. Like on espn, he was one of the worst sports father. It's all this media did. It's bullshit. He's actually one of the most generous fucking guys in the training of trainers that I've met. He's one of the most generous and it was one of the most transparent guys I've ever met. Honest guy. That's awesome. I think all about the product.

Speaker 3:          02:23:43       The problem, the problem with the espn documentary, we said his son went off the rails and when the sun goes off the rails, everybody looks for someone to blame. You know that he was too strict, didn't give his son sugar. He didn't even let it sunny meet, right? Uh, I think he did. I don't know. I don't know about that. It was something on the documentary. They were saying, well it didn't let him have wheat gluten. I think. Really? Yeah. Even back then I think they were saying meet. I saw it really recently. Maybe it was certain types of meat. Yeah. When I knew I was going to talk to you. I think that's when I watched it. Um, but uh, it's just, it's fascinating to see a guy with that much knowledge take a sun and turn them into this fucking super freak athlete. I mean, as in certain ways it was sort of, I mean it was vindicated. His techniques and strategies have been, look how good is god damn son was until you go crazy with the drugs and the partying and all that stuff. The idea was that the discipline was too much and he couldn't take it anymore and then he had to start it. And

Speaker 2:          02:24:40       do you want drugs? You know, you can blame it on whatever you want and only put the stuff into his mouth. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          02:24:46       Right. That's a good point. And you could get 10 different personalities when you know you have a son, if you have more kids. I have three. They're all, they come out of the box completely different. You know, they just worried about math. Like I love my son so much, I don't know anything different, you know, it's, believe me, I have two. My two youngest are completely different. I love them equally. They're totally different, but there they have their own little thing going on. But the point being that it's a different children, different humans will react differently to different forms of diversity that they face and there's only so much you could do as a parent, you know, you can't really

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       totally protect them and shield them. And it seemed like his son has come back from all that stuff and he's okay now, right? Yeah. But just as an artist man, his arts pretty bitch until now. I guess he's living up in Oregon, you know, I don't really know todd very well, but I've actually never even met todd. So. But uh, yeah, I guess he's living up in Oregon and it's got some killer art man. And there's also the reality that when you push your son or your daughter, anyone, any human being, they, people have a resistance to some of that shit and they don't want to do what you want them to do. And they developed a distaste for something, even something that they're really, really talented at. Yeah. That's possible as well. Yeah. Well, you know what the funny thIng is, did you ever read that story about his son run into like a tenncare something when he was four years old?

Speaker 1:          02:26:10       No, they didn't really like an eight minute mile or something when he's four years old. And I asked them about that one day. I said, mom, what the hell is that like, you know, like an eight minute mile. He's like, so yeah. You know what? I can't figure out. Nick is why everybody thinks I made him do it. I didn't make him do it. That's what he said he wanted to do it. So he had that drive and that intensity that, you know what I mean? So it's kinda like shed some light on some things right there. Well, hey man, you know, whenever someone comes out in a weird way, you use a lot of people are trying to point blame and a lot of different areas, whether it's the fram, the friends of the family or the seemed like just college coaches had a real issue with him as well, right?

Speaker 1:          02:26:51       Yeah. Put them in a box. Yeah, that's a. Yeah. And then he kind of took over and worked for. I was made the coach look foolish and they didn't like that either. Right. um, what is the name of that documentary? But he wants to watch it like a 30, 30, and 30 or some of the project. Wasn't that it? I think that was at a mars in the beginning talking about he's an undefeated wrestler, undefeated boxer. That's great man. A lot of people don't know that about him. He was a football player too, you know? Uh, but he was also an undefeated boxer and wrestler through the army and college and stuff. And his, just, his fascination with training athletes was more powerful than his fascination with competing. Well, he wAs. So I guess mara was sold into weightlifting and he felt the destroyed his athleticism once he went to the raiders and he was competing with the guys in the weight room human, he's squatting a thousand pounds and he said his athleticism had never been worse.

Speaker 1:          02:27:49       It was the, when he was doing that and that just destroyed his professional career. That's interesting. Yeah. Wow. And so that, that was in the sixties, right? Like it's got to be in the sixties. So he figured he had that awakening s 50 years ago. Wow. And you know, he's been developing this stuff for years. So nick, thank you very much for your time matt. I really appreciate it. This is a great conversation. I really, really enjoyed it. And uh, anybody who wants to check out your gym, what is the name of it? Whereas he speed of sport, uh, you can go to [inaudible] dot com, speed of sport.com. [inaudible] dot com. And is located in torrance, California and torrance and speed of sport on twitter. Yeah, that's your handle. Yeah. Alright. Alright. Very enjoyable conversation. I really appreciate it. Thanks. All right friends. We'll be back tomorrow. See you later. Bye.

Speaker 5:          02:28:40       That fine.
