Speaker 1:          00:00:05       And we're live. Hello, Michael Shermer road. You could see with your pile of your writing, what could you got? Their moral arc? Heavens on earth. Okay. You just have to take magazine. It's the latest issue. Why is there something rather than nothing? We'd like to tackle the little questions. That's a deep one. You've dealt with this on the show. Yeah. Too much. It's a, that's one that just, you know, when you're in traffic and you know, what is this? When you have someone like neil or Sean Carroll or, or, uh, Lawrence Krauss talking about this, it's like, Whoa, I'm not a physicist. I'm a social scientist. So for me, I come at it like, what do you mean by this word? Nothing. Because most of us have this idea of what I mean. Oh No. In physics it means this other thing like, okay, well I think our limited understanding of what they're talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       Like when I see those guys writing down on legal papers with all that scritchy scratchy, crazy looking very fake alien language and mathematics. Like, thank God you guys are out there. Well, I opened heaven on earth with. Imagine yourself dead and you know, most people go, well, you know, I see myself in the casket and my friends and family around a hopefully their morning. No, you wouldn't see anything. Of course you, you're dead to imagine anything. You have to be conscious and alive so you can't even picture being dead. So he can't picture not existing. And it would be the same thing. Imagine there's no universe. Okay, I see blackness. No, there's no blackness. I mean, nothing would literally be not just no light, but no, no perception of darkness, nothing. Not even nothing. I was going through instagram the other day and there was this one person who was talking about the purpose of life and when you die, what's going to happen?

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       And I immediately just started laughing. I'm like, you don't know how he's saying this, like when you die, what happens? And he was like, one of them spiritual type characters is just kind of a huckster, is a lot of spiritual hucksters out there these days. There are. Yes. The, in the nineties we debunked all those psychics talking to the dead. That was, uh, that, that hasn't been too popular in recent years, but that was a big thing, but caught onto that little earpiece thing, the earpiece or just the cold reading. I see a father figure as a grandfather, father, uncle, friend of the family, you know, you can. And uh, he saying something about, um, you know, it's okay for you to forgive yourself. Oh, okay. Well where was the, will he hid his will somewhere? Where is that? Because that's what we want to know is that ring he had. Whereas if you're just vague enough, I mean like horoscopes of you're just vague enough people who are like, oh my God, it's right all the time. It's always right. Like, that's not even a real horoscope. If you really want to pay attention to actual astrology that you have to know the date you were born, that time you were born. It's not just the month of August, you know, it's like they got to know, they want to know or evening,

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       you know, what do you think about all that stuff? It's all bunk, is it? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Why has it been around so long? Well, because the, well it's called the barnum effect where pt Barnum, you just offer something for everybody. So if you make a general enough, you know, I, I sent you an intelligent, wise person that people really enjoy your company and you like going to parties and being with other people and yet you liked the quiet solitude of a walk on the beach and when people go, yeah, that is so me. Well, I've pretty much described every scenario. You can have your alone, you're with people. But it's one of those things where if you talk to someone who is an actual believer in astrology, like they, they are so convinced. I got a friend of mine who was trying to tell me that he makes all of his decisions based on consulting with his astrologer.

Speaker 2:          00:03:48       Well Reagan, Nancy Reagan for his travel. After he was shot, she got real paranoid about that. Well, so part of the problem is the astrologers and psychics are themselves remembering their hits and forgetting their misses, the confirmation. And so I knew a psychic or a magician who was working. The psychic friends network back in the nineties when it's hard, it's hard to make a living as a magician doing kids' parties. They all want to have their own biggest show, but only a few people get that. So you got to do something on the side. So this guy was doing psychic friends network and uh, he told me all about it. They gave him a book, a three ring binder and you know, here's the kinds of things you should say and you know, people are calling for love, health, money, career questions. So you can spend 20, 30 minutes at three 95 a minute just going through there.

Speaker 2:          00:04:33       You know, I sent you in a relationship right now and one of these more committed than the other. Tell me about that. Ten minutes later, you know, there's still talking and you're thinking about travel. You're not happy with your job. There's some financial stress in your life right now. And then he told me about stuff like, now go get a crystal and then a candle. I want you to set it up here on your desk and this would go on and on for hours and they charge by the hour and they chose what they are. So one of the problems that psychic friend networks had was people were not paying their phone bills because they come back on $800 phone. They would just not pay it. So the phone companies crackdown down on the psychic friends network company going, hey, this is getting out of hand that people aren't paying their bills.

Speaker 2:          00:05:12       So they had to ratchet it back a little bit. This right. They would do it through the phone. That's interesting. Yeah. They wouldn't get a credit card from you. They would just stay on the line with you. Right. So he told me that when he first started, he got like sixty cents on the minute a for three 95 at that per minute. But then they bumped it up as he got more experience and kept them on the line longer. They gave them bonuses, now you get a dollar per minute or whatever. How is that not illegal? I mean, he's not even a psychic, shouldn't you have to be a doctor? You have to go and you've got to go to medical school. We've got to get a degree. Shouldn't. There's a interesting history there because in New York City for example, it was difficult to outlaw like the three card Monte guys on the sidewalk with the cardboard because it's just kind of a game right now.

Speaker 2:          00:05:56       Now it would be illegal to sell fraudulent stocks or something like that or sell a product that's advertised as a health product when it's not, but if say in that case it's under food rather than drugs or say no health products like vitamins are under different standards than say medical drugs. I'm a psychic is more like an entertainer. So this is for entertainment purposes only, so we can do whatever we want as opposed to a medical doctorate. That's dispensing advice. So in medical doctor is a bad example. Maybe I shouldn't say that engineer, but the point is like, if you're going to work as a psychic, like on a psychic network, if you have a business of selling psychics, like you should be able to. You have to exhibit some sort of psychic something. Well, they can't, uh, you know, under controlled conditions they always fail.

Speaker 2:          00:06:48       There's nothing that's ever been done. Now what about the one thing that I've read that a statistically more people can recognize that people are staring at them, like when they're looking at you from behind that horseshit? Well, it's not been. It's not been consistently replicated. So is it possible some people with a certain sensitivity can detect? Okay. So one explanation, the skeptics explanation is that if I'm in a say a starbucks or something and I kind of have a sense that people are talking about maybe looking at me and, and, and I look and that catches somebody's eye and they turned to me and I think, oh, that person's looking at me or vice versa. I'm looking at them and then they send something or whatever. So there could be some element of chance to that. Now I'm the guy that does this, rupert sheldrake, um, you know, he believes that it's actually some kind of like a psychic power through the medium like that when I'm looking at you, something's coming out of my eyes and particularly in your neck.

Speaker 2:          00:07:45       So that's morphic resonance, morphic resonance. Now Richard Wiseman, a British like experimental psychologist, he's tried to replicate that and he always fails. And then this other woman, Marilyn Schlitz, she also tried to replicate it and she was able to replicate some of it. So there may be an experimenter bias. It's not clear if it's the skeptics that are biased or the believers that are bias, but in that case it's best to just say, you know, we don't know it. So the default position, the null hypothesis is that it's not true until you prove otherwise. And that's a difficult one to prove. Now if they say, if I say, well, why is the effect so subtle? Why can't you go to Vegas and become a millionaire gambling or play the stock market? You know, we know traders just need a tiny, you know, one point point, oh, one percent advantage over the other traders, whatever, and they can make a lot of times it just psychic abilities.

Speaker 2:          00:08:33       Psychic abilities is a very broad term, right? It's almost like saying drugs because like certain drugs that put you to sleep and certain drugs that make you hyper, they have very different effects. So saying psychic ability, like maybe have the ability to see if someone's looking at you, but you don't have the ability to pick the lottery. Right? Uh, so the hard part in testing psych exist to pin down what exactly are you saying you could do? Right? And that that's where it gets pretty fuzzy. So these like why is it legal for the phone psychics? Because they, you can't pin them down. If somebody says, look, I'm just giving relationship advice, why is that illegal? If I say like the Tony Robbins Netflix documentary, I'm not your guru, which is basically I am your guru. He has that moment in this huge auditorium. There's like 3000 people there and he gets this woman up on stage and she's got relationship problems.

Speaker 2:          00:09:19       He says, do you have your phone feels yeah, take out your phone and call him right now. And she talks her through dumping this guy onstage on the phone and he's at work or something. He's like, what? And then she hangs up and everybody's happy that she did this. Now is that a good thing or a bad thing? I have no idea. It's great for show business, but what if you know, so how the fuck. I mean that seems crazy. Like how do you know what kind of relationship they really have. Now somebody that talked to both of them, right? Wouldn't you? Somebody that I brought this up at a, at an event recently, a party and somebody said, oh, I know the backstory. His staff had been working the audience and they, they knew all about her and the relationship and it was about to go sour anyway, so we brought her up.

Speaker 2:          00:10:03       It's like, okay, so this is the thing, what you see the psychics on tv, there's a lot of stuff you don't see. They work the audience, they know, people fill out like the psych, the faith healers, they fill out prayer cards, they put their name and address and their ailment and then, you know, the faith healers have a little earbud in there and they're listening to the person in the back reading, okay, here's the person they have clocked coma or whatever and you hear him calling this out. So, uh, so there's a lot of that that we don't see. The Anthony Robbins is not claiming any kind of psychic ability. He just, he's just trying to provide positive path for improving your life. And if you're in a bad relationship, that would be a positive path. Let's get out of that relationship and then move forward with it with emotion and power and love and fucking probably throw a karate kick and get everybody pumped up and jump around a little Bobby Brown headphones on.

Speaker 2:          00:10:56       But he's, he's a showman too. Yeah, that's right. So, but, but my point is that the psychic could say the same thing. Look, I'm just dishing out at. I don't know. I mean it, it's weird to put him in that category, right? Because he's just trying to get people excited. He, I think he does some good. I really do because he did me some good when I was 21 years old. I used to listen to his, I think it was called unlimited power. I think that was the name of the book and I listened to it on audio cassette by the pool was shitty apartment that I was living in when I was trying to be a standup comedian and it helped me. He had some really good advice in terms of setting goals and in terms of like the way you approach things and look at things. But I agree all of that in any of these self help books, Jockos books or Amy Alkon. There's a lot of stuff that very similar to what Tony Robbins. A issues and. Okay. That makes sense. Set goals and be motivated and think positive. Maybe air a little bit on the side of over optimism

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       so you can push through the failures, but don't be blind because maybe it's certain times it cut and run and change course in your life. Something like that. The hard part is getting, getting is studying that which, you know, experimentally which are the best techniques versus others. And um, there was a guy wrote a book called Sham s h a m self-help actualization movement and he was the head guy for Rodale press that publishes these self help books. Um, and so his takeaway on in this book was that the number one predictor of people who will buy, sell up books are people who already bought self help books and they continue buying them. So if you say, does it work? Well, it works. If you work at sort of consistently like you gotta listen to the tapes like every weekend or every low moment. It's not like taking the pill and your cancer's gone.

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       Uh, you have to kind of keep practicing it as this is a lifestyle change for it to work. Yeah. That's um, and also what do you mean by work? So Tony goes into a corporation and they get a bump a, this is an example in this book to get a bump in sales. So they get the salesmen all motivated, they hit the phones on Monday morning, you know, within two weeks their sales are kind of back to where they were. So you get. So they got to bring the self help guy back in every month or so to keep them super motivated. Well you've got to give them some sort of incentive to state, state pumped, right? I mean some financial incentives, like one of those I'm old school phrases. The inspiration is like bathing. It works, but you have to do it regularly in order for it to be effective.

Speaker 1:          00:13:28       I like that. I mean bathing works, but it doesn't mean you like hey, two months later a smell like shit. It works. Yeah. Daily. Yeah. You have to do it all the time. It's like saying why? Why can't the NFL teams play the whole game like the last two minutes? Because it's so exciting. The two minute drill, because they can't do it physically. You can't keep that up. Yeah, yeah. Well, I think you could physically keep up that enthusiasm that Anthony Robbins provides, but you have to be either you have to have some sort of an office environment that is an incredibly enthusiastic to the point where you guys have engineered this environment where everybody's pumped up, but that's going to be a being that doesn't leave a whole lot of room for the individual to be themselves. I feel like that would be terrible to work for a place like that where everywhere you go there's motivational sayings and people were chanting things in the hallway and everybody's just got energy at 10.

Speaker 1:          00:14:22       It's a Co, you know, that's. That's what a guy like anthony robins will provide you for a short burst. We just hope that some of it sticks. Right? Well, this is amy elkanns book. Unfuck allergy. It's great, but yeah, she calls these small wins or whoever calls him small wins, like make your bed in the morning or shave or whatever, or like Jockos little twitter posts at 4:30 AM. Yes. Now I'm never getting up at 4:30, but when I get up at 6:30, we'll occasionally like five this morning for the morning ride. That leaves at 7:00 AM. I get up at 5:30, so I'm not happy getting up at 5:30, but I think, okay, Jocko has been up an hour. He's already worked out already done working out. Okay. I can't really complain. Come on. Shermer giggling that, that kind of little thing. This is Jordan Jordan Peterson point of the, you know, make, get your life in order.

Speaker 1:          00:15:08       What is he talking about? Just stand up straight. Make your bed, clean your room. What's he talking about? He's talking about these little wins, like if you can do that, then the next thing that's a little harder comes a little easier and also those things that are in the background. If you know that your your life as a master cars filled with fast food wrappers, you're, you know, you're, you're, you've got that thing that you haven't taken care of in the back of your head that, that will, that that's going to disrupt. It's going to be flowing in your thoughts. For the most part, it'll be a distraction. Right, so those little things apparently do matter. There's a theory of crime called the broken windows theory that is favored by criminologists to explain the decline. The crime decline in the nineties. What happened in New York City, they started cleaning up the graffiti.

Speaker 1:          00:15:57       They started catching the turnstile jumpers. They started cleaning up the streets. They started boarding up. Windows has no broken windows or replacing the windows. The theory is that if there's a signal in society that no one's paying attention, there is no law and order here. There are no rules or norms. Do whatever the fuck you want. You're going to get more crime if you send the signal through little things like we're not gonna, allow graffiti on this wall anymore and no more turnstile jumpers in the subways and so on. And so when, when that happened, then there was a trickle down effect and then crime decline. So that's the most popular theory for that and I think there's something to that. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And what they did with New York City is really fantastic if you, if you go back to when I was a kid and I traveled to New York City the first time when I saw times square, I guess it was probably like 18 or 19.

Speaker 1:          00:16:47       I was like, look at this fucking crazy place. Like this is madness. And you know, you see it in movies and it's just always this horrific scene. It's always peep shows and hookers and pimps and thugs and drug dealers. And you go there now and it's like a mall threw up. It's like a giant neon mall of America Time Square. If you took a person, if you grabbed a guy from like 1988 and you put them in a time machine, said, hey man, I'm going to bring you 30 years in the future and you're going to see New York City the way it looks. Then like, what do you expect? Like, oh my God, it's going to be like, like blade runner. People are going to be shooting people and selling body parts and now you get there and it's like Guy Fieri Aries restaurant. And two huge, gigantic lcd screens and then there's some people that would long for the old days, the dirty seediness Lenny Bruce talked about, you know, and he lived there.

Speaker 1:          00:17:43       It's like, I mean, well that has a certain charm, I guess if go going into the nightclubs or whatever, but the surrounding daytime neighborhood or something, you, this isn't where you want to live rather live in the vomited mall. Well, I'm not crazy about that either, but uh, but, so there's a reason why cities have certain restrictions on those kinds of stories coming in in a crappy neighborhood like downtown, old town. Pasadena now is kind of a hip place to go. But in the seventies when I went to the ice house, but, you know, back in the day, in the seventies, uh, just as a spectator and uh, but it was terrible down there and wasn't really. Oh yeah, it was a dump. I mean, there was. Oh, terrible. Yeah, it was horrible. The word was, according to my friend Bob Fisher, who owns the icehouse, he said that what it was was in the early days of Hollywood, the producers would all buy homes in Pasedena.

Speaker 1:          00:18:36       These, they have these beautiful old estates in Pasadena, but the stars would all live in the Hollywood hills, so they would all be just boozing it up and partying down in the Hollywood hills and the producers like let those crazy animals go have added in the hills. We're going to back out a little bit and they, they establish that community out there in Pasadena. Right? Right. So to turn it around, like one of the key things, uh, a mall can do is get an what they call an anchor store. Someone like a saks fifth avenue, somebody that's really respectable, big. And then you can call the other guys, go, look, we've got saks fifth avenue. Oh, you got sex because they haven't even. Then I can be next to him. And then it starts going and then little by little, each of them cleans up their neighborhood a little bit more.

Speaker 1:          00:19:20       And pretty soon you end up with old town. Pasadena, now, well I was telling you guys before I had an issue today where my credit card got robbed and uh, you know, whatever credit card fraud, someone got a hold of my number, which is really, that's the one thing that people worry about the most about shopping online. Right? But I guess that could kind of happen everywhere, but you got to think that if there's anything that has changed malls more than anything, it's got to be the ability to just shop online on your phone like Amazon. That the fact that they figured that out. I remember when Amazon came out and it was just a bookstore. I was like, who the fuck is going to buy books online? You can just go to the bookstore. This is ridiculous. What a stupid business. Meanwhile, that guy has more money than any human on the planet is poor bastards.

Speaker 1:          00:20:06       Getting divorced too. I heard last night that there's a rule in Washington that everything that you make as a couple, you have to split. We've been together for over 25 years. California, California law is. Yes, 50 slash 50. Well, longterm marriages, 20 years or 10 years or more, it's 50 slash 50 and that includes downstream income from anything you did that you're still getting paid for. Say Ten years ago you wrote a book or whatever. Mrs Bezos is getting paid and he's worth 100 plus billion dollar and 37. They said, wow, so she's going to get half of that. We're probably going to. Because it's a lot of stock. They said they're going to have to just be stay friends because they better be super nice to him. Even if he gives her a quarter. She's like, I got Rollin got wrong. The richest people in the world now, but after all these bookstores, when a business, there's some irony that Amazon now wants to start opening physical brick and mortar stores.

Speaker 1:          00:21:04       That is kind of ironic, but it does make sense though because there are some brick and mortar stores and I think that guy's a conquer. I think he just wants to take over everything. Well, why else would he buy whole foods? And I was like, Oh, the supermarket business, I can fuck this up too. Well, automate it. He can, I don't know, maybe get ordered whole foods delivered to your house. I think the, I don't know if that's available yet, but I think it is right as an essay now. Most grocery stores even like all the Ralphs have home delivery within two hours to compete with Amazon prime. Right? Yeah. Wow. Are. And if they don't do that, you can just order it online and pick it up and I'll bring it out to. I went to pavilion's the other day and they had a bunch of delivery trucks parked in the parking lot.

Speaker 1:          00:21:44       I was like, look at this, think of these cool delivery trucks. Have to have that one store you can walk in and there's no cashiers. They just trust that everyone's not stealing. And I think they just are comfortable with a certain amount of theft. Oh Wow. Yeah, that's interesting. Well, they probably have cameras everywhere too, you know, but it's um, the online purchasing like that has got to put, that must be putting the most, as far as like the most impact on stores, brick and mortar stores. It's like the ability to purchase online. It's got to be devastating for them. Right? Totally. And up in Santa Barbara where I live now and just riding upstate street this morning at the end of the ride, you know, it's like the third, maybe a quarter of the stores are closed out of business empty and you know, state street, Santa Barbara, this was like the happened in place to be and I and a real estate friend of mine says, Oh, well let's see that story there.

Speaker 1:          00:22:36       That's $22,000 a month to lease. Like, Whoa, okay. So you have to. Then you have to have a retail outlet that's really turning over the customers and there's a lot that just can't do that. I mean you can't have an antique store that's going to do that are a little knickknack store. Santa Barbara is one of my favorite places and it's really interesting because it's a, it's a small area, like I don't even think there's 150,000 people less than it is about 90,000. Is it Montecito included or with Montecito included? Galito Gilead is like another 30,000 or so below that. You have carpenter Ria, that's like another $20,000 or so, so yeah, it's beautiful. Yeah, that's great. You get the right spot, man, but it's also, I feel like it needs to be that close to Los Angeles. Yeah, like you get a little bit of trickle. I can sit down there 75 miles from my house to your studio here in my office, in Alta Dena for a skeptic magazine.

Speaker 1:          00:23:29       That's 105 miles. So it's doable. Yeah. Yeah, but it's, it's. I think that as human beings when they're living in these gigantic communities, whether it's Los Angeles or New York or something like that, there's just a certain amount of people become less valuable. You know, there's just too many of them and you, you'll lose that sort of appreciation for people and there's like a tension around like you, you don't mind if a few people drop off. It's no. You know what I mean? Yeah. There's a balance in size. My wife's from Cologne, Germany, which is about a 1 million people and that's, that's about as big as you want to get. It's a big enough city. There's lots of action, could do all sorts of things, uh, but it's not 6 million or 10 million, which is just like La. It's just too many of you ever seen that study that they did where they set up a camera on one end of the street and the camera on the other end of the street and they timed people walking through and in those, in the, the, the, the footage of those people walking through, they were able to determine by how fast these people walked.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       They got an average of which was really accurate of how many people lived in the city. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The scale. Yeah. There's that book that physicist a West Jeff G, e o f f West I think is his name, wrote that book and it. And the bigger the city, the more efficient and faster things become including dialogue, the way people communicate, talk a little faster and faster. And he had a formula showing how many restaurants per one, hundred thousand gas stations per hundred thousand you'll get as you scale up. You don't need as many restaurants and gas stations as populations increase because there's more efficiency in the flow of traffic and people throughout the city, whereas smaller towns are less efficient that that was the theory, but it's just fascinating that human beings adjust because of all of these other human beings around them. They changed the way they walk, they walk faster, they talk faster.

Speaker 1:          00:25:30       So it's a right here scale scale the universal laws of life and death in the organism. Cities and companies listening to it right now actually coincidentally, could winky dinky. Yeah. Um, that's, that's. I mean, you feel it. You know, when I lived in boulder for a shorter amount of time, one of the things, you know, Boulder's small as well, I think it's 100,000 people. When I came back here, the first thing I realized is how fast everyone's driving, right? Everyone's just cutting everybody off and zooming ahead and, and, and people are really in a rush everywhere they go. And that has to be in some way, shape or form. It has to be influenced by all the other people around them and their energy. Right. What is that? What do you think that is though? Well, first of all, it's all unconscious. I think it's just mostly the kind of overall pace you get that pushes everybody along. We're slows them down. I just started this book called a rule makers and rule breakers. It's a by a woman who is a cultural psychologist. Sorry, I forget her name, the rule makers rule breakers. So he talks about tight cultures versus losing as fast as a fucking Michele gelfand yet. So she talks about tight versus loose

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       culture. So like again, my wife from Germany, it's a tighter culture that the norm that people are more likely to obey norms and rules and there's a little more uncomfortableness and violating them. California were a little loosey Goosey about rules and, and so my wife's, I was giving me a hard time about, you know, my idea of traffic laws is I'll just do whatever, you know, I feel like pretty much if, as long as it's safe and I kind of know, uh, you know, I'm driving up the one on one. If I stay at a 79 or below, I'm fine. And she's like, but the 65, it's like, yeah, so what? I mean, I know where the cops park. I know everybody else is going on in the left, turn into our street is a left Arrow. So of course my wife, she's just like, well we got to wait.

Speaker 2:          00:27:26       It's like, but it's midnight. I'm just going to go. You can't go. It's like, yeah, this California, I'm going nowhere. So that's a tight culture versus loose culture. So I guess she's going to talk about how norms that affect laws and how then people change their behavior. You're not even aware that you're doing this, you're just kind of unconsciously absorbing the cultures. But what do you think? But there's a difference between west coast tight culture like la or large groups rather an east coast large groups. Do you think that's influenced by whether it's one of the things that I've been thinking about a lot, the, the aggression of east coasters is very different than the aggression of West coasters and I always wonder, it's like how much of that is because they have to deal with shit whether for five months out of the year it could be that, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:28:13       I'm a and the influence of immigrants as well, like because, uh, like my, my parents, my grandparents were immigrants. They all came over from England and Ireland and Italy and they were all savages. They were all people that were willing to get on a boat and cross the ocean. Right. You know, those are aggressive people. They're like, I'm getting Outta here. Fuck you. And then the landlord Alzheimer's, you're higher risk takers. Yes, yes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So it's not a random population that came to America, nor with Australia, you know, you send all these converts on fixed. They're not going to be a typical gene pool there. So meanwhile, how good did that work out? Those are the nicest people ever. Well, same thing, you know, Germans after World War One and World War Two, oh, these are bellicose people, but there are national character now. They're the nicest people in the world.

Speaker 2:          00:29:00       They don't want to fight anybody. Yeah. That generation, right? More than that. I mean they have massive war guilt and guilt. Uh, yeah. I mean they are all raised in taking tons of classes in school about what happened, why we're never going to do this again. Here's what we did at the Jew, you know, they're still paying Israel reparations for that. There are these little stumbling stones that are the sort of brass square cubes all over Germany of the name and year that that person was murdered. These are all Jews in front of the house where they used to live there all over the place. Yeah. I have a picture of him and the moral arc here, I'll show you. It's, it's really dramatic. It's. And when you literally stumbled across them, I mean, they're just there in the street. Uh, you might, if you google stumbling stones, you can see that they're better in four color.

Speaker 2:          00:29:52       Another interesting thing about Germany is they won't let scientology and sensitive about cults and cult behavior. That's right. Well, there's another reason for that and that is in the picture. Now I'm in Germany. Most people don't know this. There's a religious studios. Jamie's religion. Yeah. There they go. Oh, so that's what they. So they're actually above ground. So you're just walking along and you look down and some of them, those are not the. They're not like that, right? They're not like little bricks on the ground and they're like that. You just said there in the ground and the ground persons and they're in front of the house where they used to live the date that they were departed in the date that they were murdered and where they were murdered. Auschwitz or a tribe triplink or dominic and so on. Yeah, there you go. So that's pretty moving.

Speaker 2:          00:30:35       It's and it's, it's kind of a reminder, this is what we did and we were not going to do this again. Remember? So that's changing norms. How does this happen? Really? It's that you can do it through the law from the top down, but really it's more a culture from the bottom up. You were saying that there's another reason besides that, besides the Holocaust, that they're sensitive to scientology. Oh yeah. Because in Germany they have a religious withholding tax. So when you get your first job, they do a withholding for your religion and they give a percentage of your paycheck to your religion, the religion you were born into baptized, whatever. It's mostly Catholic and Protestant, but others want to get in on that because that's cumulative. You know, you can make some money doing this as a religion. The humanists of Germany get a little piece of this action.

Speaker 2:          00:31:25       It's considered a religion. So scientology when they saw that, they went, oh, okay, free government money, tax money, and uh, the Germans got, no, you're not a real religion. You're not getting in on this. And uh, yeah. So again, when, when my wife came here, before she came here, she quit church and you literally have to go down to the courthouse, fill out a form and say, I am leaving the church. Please don't take my money anymore out of my paycheck. So you have to opt out. You will be giving money to your religion unless you fill out the form and opt out. Wow. And uh, and, and in this case it was kind of a funny story. They go, okay, so just to make sure you know, now if you sign this, you can't get married in the Catholic church, can't get buried in the Catholic church.

Speaker 2:          00:32:07       You can't go to the ceremonies and so on, you're done. And she goes, Yep, that's the way I want it. And she went down there with her four horsemen, tee-shirts, said Dawkins, Dennis Harrison, hitchins. And they're like, who's this? Anyway? So they set up, but now the moment you signed it starts effective today. But there's a three month lag for us to not take the money out of your paycheck. My wife is like, yeah, like, wait a minute. It went up in a business. When it contract ends at ANZ for both parties. They go like, no, they just get to steal money for three months, three more months. Yeah. What a weird thing

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       that you have to opt out like that, that it has to be so definitive that you have to sign papers and go someplace. What does fucking shady law it is? It's no good. I know that's gotta change. So a lot of us are trying to talk people into opting out quit church. Well, it is amazing that in this country I would like to know what the number is if the churches in this country had to pay taxes didn't mean clearly, especially when you look at the televangelist that are driving rolls royces and flying around in private jets. I mean there's profit is extreme amount of profit and it's discretionary income. They can do whatever they want with it and you're, you're dealing with massive, massive sums of money and they don't contribute. So these people are clearly personally benefiting from the contributions of these people.

Speaker 1:          00:33:26       And then they don't pay taxes on it. And in the case of like ministers who live in a church owned home, they don't have to pay property tax. Uh, there's a lot of hidden benefits there. It's dirty, it is dirty. It's amazing that it's still here. I mean, especially when you deal with something like scientology will, you know, the guy who wrote it like it's, this is not some ancient texts that were handed down from, you know, the guy and the guy was a terrible writer. I mean, he was a terrible science fiction author. He just wrote every fucking thing he wrote was a first draft, just boom gone. I mean, it's just the most nonsensical nonsense writing and yet they don't have to pay taxes because it's considered a legitimate religion. Hurl is Harlan Ellison, the great science fiction writer this year, uh, told me the story of what the famous story where l Ron Hubbard allegedly said, I'm going to go start a religion.

Speaker 1:          00:34:20       He said it was, it's real. It's a true story. They were but, but it was just a bunch of science fiction writers sitting around like this chatting and complaining about how poorly paid they are. They have to crank out by the word, you know, Kenny at word kind of thing. And somebody said, you know, we should just start a religion and make shit up like that. And I'll, Ron Hubbard says, yeah, you know, that's a good idea, I think. I think I might do that. And then he went out and wrote dianetics and that became the founding document of scientology. Did you watch the, um, the HBO series on it? The documentary rather? Yeah, going clear. Unbelievable. That's the best documentary on. Of course, I've seen AALIYAH's show. She's got a big guts to go after. I don't know if she's got good lawyers are a and he has good lawyers or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:35:03       Maybe they've stopped suing people. I don't know. I think the climate has shifted and I think people were more, first of all, for the longest time, all we thought of when you thought about scientology, thought about positive thinking and John Travolta, Tom Cruise and they're all super positive, you know, and they're getting things done and there's auditing and they're really taking care of their mind and thinking clearly and eliminating all the negative influences. But then once there was a bunch of factors I think. But once the Internet opened up these the doctrines and you've got a chance to read it and people got a chance to mock it and then South Park did that whole series on it where they, this is what they actually believe. And you see like when south park did that, everybody was like, Holy Shit, wait a minute, is that real? And then people started googling it and then looking into it and then it started to unravel.

Speaker 1:          00:35:52       Slowly but surely people started leaving the church, Lawrence Wright wrote the book, all these things are happening and now Leah is coming in and Leah was, you know, I knew her but I mean I'm friends with Kevin James from the king and Queen. And so I, I've known Leah for 20 plus years and when I first met her she was just like this hard ass beautiful woman who's just like driven and like, like she's a scientologist, like Oh, let's get the fuck out of her way. You know? It was like that. She's just like super active and just getting things done and just being productive. I mean, that's what you thought about when you thought about scientology, but now what you think about it is nonsense. It's just foolishness and, and once going clear area and you've got to see l Ron Hubbard and listened to him talk and you see the captain's outfit he had on with the medals that he gave himself.

Speaker 1:          00:36:43       Like what? Who would buy this test? Cell Dumb. It's just, it's amazing that it's so effective and so financially successful. Uh, yeah. I think their membership roles are pretty low, but their property holdings I think are pretty extensive. Yeah. I mean they're the second biggest real estate owner in Los Angeles. Is that right? Yeah. At least they were. There were some Japanese folks that were number one and then it was a number two was scientology. Maybe that's not true anymore. Might be oil barons now. Well, back in the nineties when the Internet first got cranked up, we were doing articles on scientology is when some of these ex members started posting the secret doctrines, the news story and the going clear at level eight or whatever. When you find out the the, the, the inside story, and they got raided. I mean the scientologists went to court to court to judges and said, this is copyrighted material and it's like, what, wait your religion, how can you copyright of religious?

Speaker 1:          00:37:46       Well, and they somehow got around that. I mean, this would be like the Catholic church not telling you about Jesus and the resurrection until level eight after you've paid $100,000 or something like that. It's just insane. Well, what's amazing is that the irs caved in. When that happened, I remember when that happened, I thought, oh my God, I don't want to fuck with these guys. I mean they'd beat the irs. I'm a nobody. How am I going to defend myself again? But maybe they've stopped suing people. Maybe they're not going after Leah. Like la real estate here goes portfolio properties reported at $400, million dollars in Hollywood alone, paid for in cash. No less. The Church of Scientology is undeniably a formidable player in the real estate game. That's what you got. They have some beautiful properties to. Yeah. It's just really amazing. It's amazing. So you know, my, my skyping friends like, oh, they're going to go out of anytime soon.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       It's like, I don't know. I think they could have practically no members instilled. They have all this real estate. Here's the thing, even though it's nonsense, just so is most religion, let's just be honest. I mean if you want to talk about guys coming back from the dead after being burned for three days or Adam and eve being the only two people and they have kids and their kids just started having sex with each other and that makes all the people in the world or Moses parting the Red Sea and Jesus walking on water. I mean, you're looking at horse shit everywhere. It's just older horseshit. It's, you know, whether or not it's based on some real events or some real people. Who knows? Who knows? But it's all nonsense. Have you ever heard a giulia, Sweeney's monologue letting go of God? No. Do you know Julia from Saturday night live?

Speaker 1:          00:39:20       I know who she is. I do not know her. She just moved back to La. So you should have her on the show. She's terrific. Love to, so um, she was born and raised Catholic love being a Catholic, the whole culture and you all. That was great. And then she started reading Dawkins and me and Harris and so on and then kind of let all that go and then she wrote a monologue. It's very moving. So the model like opens, she's in her house in Hollywood and the Mormon boys come by and she invites them in and they want to tell the story and she's thinking this is like a Hollywood pitch story. You're going to pitch the story and I'll get back to you later. Tell you to like it. No, no. They wanted it to actually press to see if she could join right then and there, you know, they're on their two year mission that they do, you know, a picture of these 2:18 year olds with their white starch shirts and their bicycles.

Speaker 1:          00:40:05       And so Julia starts pressing him a little bit. So what's the story here? Well see this guy, Joseph Smith, he, he found these gold plates in his backyard and he translated to them from ancient hieroglyphics into English. And with these magic stones and they're going on and then Jesus came to America and there was the good Indians and the Indians. And Julie's like, I just want to tell them, okay, don't start with this story. This is a bad pitch story. Even the scientologists no, don't tell them about new until way down the line. But then she says, reflecting on it, you know, if, if I told somebody my Catholic story who never heard of it, it would sound just as wacky because it's virgin and the resurrection will let all of its wacky. One hundred percent. I mean, it's like we were talking about earlier. When you die, what's going to happen is you don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:40:54       You don't know. And the reality is, look, maybe there is an afterlife. Maybe when we stopped living, something happens and our essential energy goes into another dimension. It's possible, but you don't know. Look, being alive is so titanic, Lee Bizarre. Just being a human being, looking through eyeballs at each other across from this wooden table that was cut down from living organisms that turned into hearts or surfaces, sand them and saw him. And then he put it in a building and it's got electricity's rolling through the walls and if you stuck a fork in there, you die. All of it is the fact that we're on a

Speaker 2:          00:41:33       planet. I mean the fact that the universe is, at least as far as we can tell, infinite, all that stuff is crazy. The idea that your essential energy doesn't transfer into some other state. Why not? The whole thing is crazy, but you don't know. That's right. No, no. You don't know to you. Whenever you say something that you're not sure of and you say, this is what's going to happen, but you don't really know. You're a huckster. That's right. Yep. Absolutely. No one knows. No one knows. And that's the conclusion. Heavens on earth. I don't know. And you don't either. I saw a bumper sticker that said militant agnostic. I don't know. And you don't either. Uh, so I mean we have to. Okay. So here's my bottom line on this yet. I don't know. You don't. No one knows for sure. I'm happy to wake up and some great place and there's a lot of my friends will be awesome unless.

Speaker 2:          00:42:21       Unless it. God was mad that you didn't follow the rules and all that. That's right. Christopher hitchens called the Christian Heaven Celestial North Korea. It's like, here's this dictator. Then knows everything you do and controls everything forever. Celestial North Korea, but he doesn't tell you any more. I told you already. I told you 2000 years ago this dude wrote it down. Pay attention to that, but then it's not even that, right? It's like one guy might've write it down a long time ago, but then a bunch of other dudes got together and how to revise it. They had like a new draft and the new drug, they get to decide. People got to decide what goes in and what doesn't go in and some of the stories are based on accounts from hundreds of years after Jesus's death. Like the Bible is a Wiki. It is like a wicked. People contributed to over the years until hitchens a at a great analogy with a.

Speaker 2:          00:43:15       When he was dying, he wrote a series of essays for Vanity Fair, his column a, which you can get as a book now, I think it's called mortality or something like that. Anyway, I'm. One of them was people think dying is like you're at a party and someone taps you on the shoulder and says, you have to leave. Now. At worst the party is going to go on without you. It's like, oh no. He goes, okay, so let's play this out. You're at the party and you get tapped on the shoulder and said, uh, you can never leave the party. You have to stay here forever with these people. Like when it, Julie is funny, lines is Mormon. Boys were telling her like, in heaven, it's going to be great. Um, you, you, you're made whole again, like the blind shall see and the deaf shall hear again in the crippled, she'll be holding in.

Speaker 2:          00:44:00       And she said, well, um, I had uterine cancer and I had my uterus taken out. Do I get my uterus back? And they're like, you can imagine these 18 year old, like, what's the uterus again? And they're like, yeah, you get your uterus back. She goes, I don't want it back. And then she said, what if he had a nose job and you liked it? Do I have to have my old nose back in heaven? That's a good point. Yeah. So, uh, and then they said that, and you get to spend the rest of eternity with your family. And she went, oh no, that would not be good in my case. Maybe there'll be cured though. They'll realize the errors of their ways. There'll be all enlightened. Well, here's the product. So this is called the problem of identity. Who are you? And you know, the, the theseus is shipped, you know, the Greek men Atar slayer, theseus comes back and is a hero and they, and they preserve his ship and the museum forever, but the wood rots and they replaced the ship.

Speaker 2:          00:44:48       And over the centuries there's no wood left from the original, but it's still cherished as if I call this termers Mustang because my first car was a 66 Ford Mustang classic. And I had that for 19 years. Those cars, it's like it was a great car, but I banged it up so much I replaced this and that, you know, every pretty much. By the time I sold it as a classic and made a nice little chunk of change on it, there was very little of the original left. But it's the pattern, not the material that counts. So this whole debate about when you're resurrected in heaven with Jesus, what's up there? Is that your physical body? If, because some Christian sects say, yeah, it's like, okay, how old are you when you're in heaven 30. This is the year they came up with because that's the year age Jesus was when he was crucified. Okay. But if Joe Rogan, I don't held 40 something. Fifty 1:51. Okay. So if, if you're a resurrected at 30 year old Joe Rogan, what happened to the last 21 years of Joe Rogan's body memories? I don't want to go back to that dude. That dude was down. You don't know. You're happy where you are in your life at this for sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, that means you're a well lived life, so what's up there with Jesus a or wouldn't mind having that body 30 year old body problems? I've been beating on it

Speaker 3:          00:46:02       21 years since then, like when I was 13 when I got hardcore into Jitsu, so that's 20 years of getting choked.

Speaker 2:          00:46:11       Of course the Christian would say, well God makes you whole again, you'll have no injuries but that's not really part of you. Part of you is your injuries, your muscles know

Speaker 3:          00:46:20       to say those, but all those, all the stuff that I did that hurt me. I also learned from that's right. Make you stronger but not just that, like learned the story. I think through incremental struggle with whether it's rigorous exercise or learning something or a. I think everything that I do that's difficult makes me just a little bit more aware, a little bit better at other things. Just a little bit, a little bit better to talk to a little bit easier to deal with, a little more friendly and all those things. I think I wouldn't give up for anything. I think that's more important than whatever injuries I've got with. I think, you know, I, I wonder how you're going to feel when you're 80. I wonder if you feel like that there's got to be a point of diminishing returns like that. I'd rather be stupid and 40 than to be enlightened and can't get out of bed very well.

Speaker 2:          00:47:10       My older athletic friend is telling me it's about mid eighties when things drop off fairly quickly and they could stay pretty fit into their seventies, maybe still racing, bike racing at 80, but 85 or so things drop off pretty quick. That's where you've got to go to hormone replacement or whatever. Yeah. Or the ice pledges or the. Yeah, the, the, the young person's blood or something. Okay. So I deal with it, you know, there's no breakthrough miracles yet, but again, I'm not against any of these things happening. You know, when, when someone like Jeff Bezos puts $100,000,000 into an aging company, I hope he's successful. Does he have $100,000,000 in an aging company? Uh, he and Peter thiel and the Google guys through Calico and a few others have invested many hundreds of millions of dollars into cup like Calico for example. These are companies that are trying to. Their big goal is to defeat aging through reengineering cells and um, that, that's the sort of philosophical goal behind it is we have to defeat aging so people can live for centuries or forever to which I say, let's not worry about living 500 years, let's, let's worry about prostate cancer and breast cancer and Alzheimer's and dementia.

Speaker 2:          00:48:23       And so I just, the little incremental medical problem, quality of life things were the things that take people out young. Yeah. So that you can live a longer, higher quality life. But Imagine Michael Shermer at 300 years old, if not, keep this body. If you can keep the body that you have now, you're moving around, great. Everything's well. You look really healthy. How smart would you be? How much? How much more enlightened or wise? Maybe I'm not against that. I'm happy to live as long as I possibly can. There are, there are people that go, well that's not right. It's not natural. It's like, okay, what's natural? There's surveys on this people and people's answer is whatever the current average lifespan is. So. Well, 80 seems about right. Okay. Fast forward to your, uh, the day before your 80th birthday. Tomorrow you're going to go. You want another week?

Speaker 2:          00:49:07       Yeah, I'll take another week. Okay. Then fast forward six days a, would you like another month? I'll take another month. Thank you. And, and that would never end. So of course if you're healthy and happy and you don't want it off yourself or whatever because you're super, super depressed or something like that. Yes. You're just gonna want to keep going? Nothing wrong with that. If we can do that, but what if you die and it's way better. What if you die and you really do, you leave your physical body. There's no need for emotions and all the entanglements of human existence and you go to this beautiful place of bliss and life and love and it's just pure love without a body. Yeah. And embodied an unhindered. I don't know what. That'd be fun. I don't know what's. Is that what we're here for? We're here for fun.

Speaker 2:          00:49:53       We're doing a shitty job. The chatty going crazy right now. Should be in a party van on the way to Vegas. I had a college professor when I was in my Christian days who asked me when I was pitching him the Christian story. He says, are there golf courses and tennis courts in heaven because I like physical challenges. You want to get out there and push myself like I don't know. You know, so I mean we'd haven't been no challenges, no working out, no physical, you know, tensions and true, right? Yeah. And maybe you don't need it, so you'd have to remove that part of humanity that we'd no longer

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       want challenges and to be pushed to better ourselves. Do they play chess in heaven when you get to win in heaven or is everybody a winner? Everybody gets a gold medal and a Nobel prize and whatever. That's. That is a problem. Are the things that we're attracted to, things that we enjoy, accomplishments and achievements and all these things that they exist only inside of the civilization inside of this, this realm that we've created. The significance of them is entirely based on our own agreements that it's important. When you take the king right now, it's important when the ball goes into the net, these we've agreed, you know when someone shoots a three pointer, it's really not that big a deal. You just throwing a ball into a hole. Really significant happens, but because we've attached all of this meaning to that, then it's something that we really want to see and everybody score the goal went in the Puck, went in the net.

Speaker 1:          00:51:20       Yes. It becomes this giant thing if they just have no good answer for this. When he said, well, what's heaven like? Psychics will tell you it's a bliss and lever would. But what does that mean? It sounds again, back to hitch. It sounds boring. I have to stay at this party forever. That sounds boring. Did you ever see the guy who took a photo of himself in heaven? No. You ever saw that he used the Samsung Galaxy phone to take a, to take a picture of himself in heaven? Are there what clouds are white is smiling. It is one of the funniest fucking photos you're ever going to find on the Internet just because of the context of it and it's fun. Yeah. I believe he was an African gentleman who was a. either he's telling the truth or is hilariously full of shit. I mean, imagine if he really did go to heaven and took a picture and we're just mocking them.

Speaker 1:          00:52:08       Really. We should be going to him for advice. That's right. So what is it really found it. You see the picture, the mocking, the memes of making fun of them afterwards. The actual picture. I'm trying to find the original. Just Google man takes. I did. That's what everyone wants to make fun of. The edit is so overwhelmingly mocking. It's so good. Oh, that's got to be playing a large part. Got It. I think this is. Everyone's saying this same this, but no, it was all white. It wasn't like that. It wasn't that. It was just like that picture of him holding his hand up like that, but it was just the background wasn't rainbows and shit like that. You could find it, man. I have faith in you. I found it the other day. Um, it's, you know, it's just hilarious that someone would be so confident to put that picture online knowing full well that the world is going to see that picture and start rubbing. The Guy who sold his soul on Ebay. I forget, I forget what he got for it, but a lot of religious people were offended by this. You can't tell your soul why not. You sold your soul to your religion. Did he get a good price? I don't know. I think it was a theater bucks or something like that, but he wanted to go to dinner with that. Yeah, that's right.

Speaker 1:          00:53:29       But my concern about all of this, obsession with the afterlife, that's not it. This is from his page. It says, woke up this morning and saw this. Had to take a picture. Oh, okay. We'll start with devin. That's not the actual photo. That photo of him and having his. What's hilarious is that picture with him that far left, far left. That's it. That's it. That's the photo. That is him. That is the photo. Went to heaven and that's it. That's the exact photo he took. I don't know who took the puddle. He's like, Hey, angel, do me a solid. Yes, not a selfie. So his one hand is down so he's not. He's not taking it with that hand. The other hand is up, lets him in heaven. Love it. The Internet is so good for mocking things though. It's so good. It's one of the best things ever in terms of like there's so many people that are paying attention and so many people that are funny that aren't comedians per se.

Speaker 1:          00:54:22       They just might work in an office somewhere and they've got a little bit of free time and they'll make a hilarious meme about something and then everybody runs with it and things just get mocked mercilessly. Remember the the video of the guy, he was having an interview and his kids started walking in behind him and he's trying to talk about foreign relations in Poland or something and the little kid is back here and then somebody. The life rushes in and so anyway, there's a bunch of funny spoof videos on that where it says some woman is sitting there talking about nuclear strategy or whatever, and then the kid comes in, she's ironing the shirt and then she diffuses a bomb and then she cleans up the socks or whatever. It's really funny. Yeah, there's we, we were always. All of our information was distributed to us through these very controlled networks, whether it's CBS or NBC or ABC and everything was very cut and dry and very professional in the way people talk.

Speaker 1:          00:55:15       The way information was presented, but now it's just, it's open and loose. Like as soon as I find out about some, something happened in the world, I google it. I go, what is it? What happened? What happened? I Google it and then I'll go to twitter and then when I go to twitter it's all pictures and memes and it's the dude with the question marks. You know that guys like, you know, there's so many memes that people will throw up when anything crazy happens in the world. It becomes so interesting to hear the news and hear commentary on the news from this just gigantic, massive humans and it's what's most funny or most interesting or most succinct or poignant that rises to the top. Yep. Yeah. There's endless content to entertain a. also just a high quality content. I mean, I'm a content producer, I write and so on and but I am a huge consumer. I go, most of the people I follow on twitter, post articles, most of them I want to read. So in the course of a couple of hours, my little window popups, you know, just spread across the top of the screen. I want to read all of these articles and I plow through as many as I can. They're pretty much like the Atlantic or vanity time,

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       whatever. They're pretty high quality, well written articles. The problem is as a content producer myself, is that the half life of these articles is so short. You know, like when I post one of my scientific American columns, I put a lot of work into it and then, you know, like a couple of hours later, maybe days later gone. No one's talking about like, well I put a lot of work into that, but it takes me out of the equation. Like the New York Times did that huge New York Times Sunday magazine article on trump's business going all the way back to the seventies, right? They, they spent like a year working on this, like 10 journalists. This would have been a pulitzer prize winning piece. This would have done in anybody else put trump. Right. I mean they had his own business contracts and lawsuits and you know, all the shady stuff going on and this got huge media attention for about a day and a half and by Sunday morning, by Tuesday, no one's talking about this anymore. It's like these guys spent a year working on this. I mean, what did it take to get that lawsuit paperwork from the Court House and they had hundreds of things like that and it's gone like, whoa.

Speaker 3:          00:57:32       Well and trump in particular, there's so many scandals that I think we've all become numb. Yeah, there is that too. Yeah. There's so many that you just. You get numb to it and it doesn't. It doesn't affect you. You just go like, Huh, he paid off at woman, whatever. Yeah. Those are the tiny ones. The big ones are the lawsuits, the businesses, you know, the construction businesses where he didn't pay small companies. You didn't pay him like a tsunami. Then these companies went under like there's a lot of those. There's a lot of the unethical business practices.

Speaker 2:          00:58:03       That's all in that article. Again, anybody else would be done in by something like that. Any politician except him. It's just amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:58:12       Well, it's also what he represents to those people. It doesn't necessarily have to be what he really is. It's what he represents. What he represents is like the American flag and eagles and so like they have this like really juvenile sense some folks do. Of what he is and what he represents this, despite all the evidence to the contrary, they have him in this category that he's going to drain the swamp and these liberals are just going to cry and he's going to make America better. Right, and that's just, that's. That's the side that they're on. They're on the make America better. Do you think it's also people don't have the time to really look into this stuff. Who could fact check these things? It's not just that. It's like if you work eight hours a day and you have children and hobbies and how much time are you really paying attention to trump's ethics, you really, really looking into it. I really considering it before you vote, are you really taking into consideration what kind of a person he is and what ripple effect it would have with any of his policies take place?

Speaker 2:          00:59:09       I think you're right. People vote by their team. This is my team. I'm sticking to it. Okay, so he won the primary. All right. That's. That's our guy. We're sticking with them no matter what. I think there's a huge element of that. For sure,

Speaker 3:          00:59:19       yeah. There's also people love to argue too and as soon

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       as they find someone as opposed to something that they believe in, they stick to their guns and they just hold strong. Despite all that mean, it would take so much for people to turn on trump. The real hardcore trump believers would take so much for them to decide enough is enough. That'll be interesting to see if members of his own party do something in 2020, probably not. Doesn't it seem like with Fox that Fox is slowly starting to shift their, their coverage a little bit, criticizing him a little bit. They're pushing back a little bit. Shepard Smith is pretty good on that. He's always been that way. He, yeah, he's always been great at that entity will probably be last to go. He's never going. Never gone. He's never gone. They have the same fucking lawyer. That's right. The fact that that didn't say Canada. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:00:04       You know that he had Michael Cohen was his lawyer like, oh, Yep. Yeah. The only thing we can have an immediate is that there's lots of sources and you just have to just cross check as many as you can. Don't take on any one channel. Well, I wish there was a really truly objective service, like it would be wonderful if there was people that were dedicated to know editorial slant whatsoever. Just 100 percent fact. This is how we know the facts regardless. Left, right? No ideological curve to it at all. Wouldn't that be fair? That there's got to be a market to that? Of course they all say that that's what they do now. Politifact is pretty good. They, they're the fact checking organization that they're not reporting news. They're reporting on politics on the facts said by politicians, so that's useful and I think there's a market competition amongst those people to get more hits like we're fact checking more than the other guys are fact checking.

Speaker 1:          01:01:02       Although there is two different. There was aim accuracy in media and then there was another one, I forget the name and one was left leaning and one was right leaning. It's like, can I have one without a wing, right wing or left wing? Yeah, it seems like that. I mean, I'm reading Jonathan hates book, the two books that I've been reading recently. One of them we discussed on the podcast we did on Monday, but the other one is the coddling of the American mind. That's good book. And I'm into that now and it's, it's fantastic. And he goes, he covers this quite a bit. Yeah. A, you know, Jonathan is onto something good there with the Heterodox Academy, which I'm a member. I'm a professor at Chapman University and so I was the first member there and our university is pretty centrist. Uh, we don't get a lot of these protests and microaggressions and safe space stuff. It's, it's pretty quiet. And Jonathan's point is that it's more of a sort of east coast, west coast public university thing or maybe Harvard, that kind of thing. Middle of the country, you don't see as much of that. Um, but the, you know, the polarization thing has gotten worse. You can see the polls since like 1990 to 2018 of, you know, you ask people how, how evil are the Democrats or Republicans and you know, used to be tiny little differences

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       and then they, you know, they diverge like that now where the other side is not just wrong, but they're immoral. They are people I do think talk radio and television feeds into that or now social media and in the bubble there. So, but on the other hand, the, and the heterodox academy as 2000 members now, professors that said, Yep, I'm going to stand up against this censorship on college campuses. You, you were talking to Jonathan about people go and you had peed on and I've known pete for many years before the hoax papers and I think they've had it in for him for a long before the hoax paper. But let's explain that to people. So this can be standalone. People goes in a James Lindsey and what is the Long Island pluck rose. And she wasn't on the podcast. I didn't get to meet her, but they, um, she's in England, I believe they published a bunch of preposterous papers, like really ridiculous, like on a, you know, a homeowner, what is it?

Speaker 2:          01:03:20       The dog park one dog rape culture and Park and the reach translation of a chapter from mine comp, replacing fem males with Jews, eliminate the males that kind of. So they did one before. They actually, Pete and James Lindsey did one two years ago on the conceptual penis. It was called and that the penis is a concept. It's not a, it's not a real thing, you know, it's just, it's a hilarious paper. And the same month that came out, it was published in a kind of a third tier feminist studies journals. So they get criticized like, eh, that's not one of the big ones. So you didn't really post anything but at the same week or that came out, there was another paper published on feminist glaciology and I thought, oh, someone beat pete to the hoax. Oh my God, this is totally. And I read it. I thought this is what's hot or bulleted glaciology know study of glaciers.

Speaker 2:          01:04:13       Oh God, yeah. And that glaciers are very hard. And, and, and, uh, racked and you know, it's all masculine and yeah. Anyway, so I called the university that was affiliated with the lead author and I said this is a hoax, right? Come on, just before I say anything, I don't want to be embarrassed. This is a hoax, right? No, no. This is real. It's like I can't tell the difference between the conceptual penis paper, which I know is a hoax because Pete wrote it and the feminist glaciology paper. That's the problem. Well, let's explain what's happening to pete now because pete was brought before a Portland State University. They, there would be charged with, uh, with uh, with faking data, fraudulent data, fraudulent research, faking data that he didn't go through the Institutional Research Board which approves experiments that professors want to run. Like for example, you could not do milgram's shock experiments where you hook people up and tell them that you're going to give electric shocks to somebody.

Speaker 2:          01:05:12       They wouldn't approve that or, or filled Zimbardo's fake jail who were randomly assign students to be prisoners and guards and they end up beating each other up. They would never approve that. Okay. So since those sort of guerrilla theater experiments of the sixties, the universities have tightened up, the kind of research are allowed to do even like the kinds of questions you would ask in a survey. They have to approve all of that. So of course Peter and James and Helen didn't do that because first of all, you know, James was the primary director of this thing. He's not affiliated with the university. He doesn't have to answer to anybody. Pete was affiliated with it, so they're getting them on that, um, and that he didn't go through the IRB and get approval. Of course, if you're going to tell people, if you're going to fake something, you can't tell them ahead of time that we're gonna fake, of course, because it's going to get out.

Speaker 2:          01:06:01       And then the Gig is up. The analogy I made a the other day was in 1971, a stanford psychologist named David Rosen, who's a clinical psychologist, sent a bunch of his graduate students into mental hospitals all over the country and said, just tell him you're feeling kind of blue and that you're kind of hear this inner voice and that, uh, it's just, you just kind of don't feel right and you need some help. So they did. They all get themselves checked in and then from there on out they acted perfectly normal and then the goal was, let's see how long it takes you to get out. And so it was a study and how mental hospitals treat people who are completely sane. So the title of his famous paper is called being sane in insane places. So first of all, the Grad students report it's incredibly boring.

Speaker 2:          01:06:51       So one of them would sit there and write essays and take notes. And, and so in the psychiatrist evaluation of this patient, patient is, you know, patient exhibits, excessive writing behavior. This is clearly an example of his erupting had bitten libidinal impulses from his childhood and Blah, blah, blah. Another one was a painter, so she's doing paintings, but landscapes and so on. Oh, patient. You can see in the paintings the erupting emotions and they conflicts in her personality. They're just acting normal. Right? So the point of this hoax was that there's something wrong with our mental institutions that they can't tell the difference between a sane and insane person. What are they doing? So of course the, the, the, the industry got pretty upset about being hoaxed. So Rosanna and came back and said, okay, in the next year I'm going to send in some more. Let's see if you can find him.

Speaker 2:          01:07:42       And he didn't send anybody. Oh Wow. So they're like, okay, we think this guy's fake again. They couldn't tell the difference in their own patients and no one was even faking. So in a way, this is kind of what Pete and James and Helen did is like, if they're sending these papers out, if you can't tell, then what are you doing in this field? Well, people are, for whatever reason, people are. Some people I should say are drawn to these nonsense ideas. And one of the papers, the dog park paper got it, got lauded for its excellent scholarship, got praised. It's one of the weirder ones that they hoaxed I mean because it's so obviously preposterous when you're reading it, you're like, I think it was the fat bodybuilding one. They get another one. I think I won an award for the best paper we've ever had.

Speaker 2:          01:08:32       Oh really? Peter and James and Helen, they, they are like professional scholars in the grievance studies because it's. If you read those things, it's hard to write like that. I mean it takes, it took them a lot of practice to get the jargon in the style then. Well, what do you think is the. What are the options for someone like Pete? Because if he does get fired from the university, what, what could he possibly do? I mean, what Jordan has done is pretty extraordinary. He's essentially left teaching at because of the controversies that he went through, he became famous. He became famous for doing podcasts and writing things and then his youtube videos are, they're so insightful and, and wonderful that people just got drawn to him. And then they go to see him speak live. They've made him into a monster, but bite censoring him by attacking him.

Speaker 2:          01:09:26       They've essentially turned him into a global international star. That's right. This is one of the best arguments against censorship is going to have the opposite effect. You wanted to. If someone is a. The quality of Jordan. Peter says, it's pretty rare. It's pretty rare. I've talked to pete about this as well as Bret Weinstein because he had suffered the same thing at evergreen and he's out, at least he and his wife Heather got a payout so they have a little cushion. But this model, like say I'm on Patrion or Dave Rubin, especially Jordan Peterson, very rare. It's very rare to be able to make a living as a public intellectual on your own. Most public intellectuals that are not in academia there with a think tank. Uh, you know, the Cato Institute or reason magazine or any of these, there's a left wing right wing. They're all over the board.

Speaker 2:          01:10:13       Uh, you know, it's possible they could get jobs there. We actually have a paycheck and those groups are usually funded by wealthy supporters that we like the cause and here's a pile of money, not through Patrion. Uh, it's possible that pete say bread could do this, but it's a tough road to hoe. I mean, Jordan is very rare. I've watched this through my whole life and you know, this idea of making $10,000 talk $50,000, $100,000 a talk, almost nobody gets that kind of money. You know, maybe Neil degrasse Tyson, Richard Dawkins, maybe Carl Sagan back in the day, whatever the equivalent of that would have been in the eighties. But that's pretty much it. Uh, you know, and there's thousands of scientists that would love to do that. Like, yeah, I want to go that. Well, they're not entertaining. The thing about Jordan is he's very engaging, like he's in his words are, it's not just their wise, it's not just, he's a very articulate.

Speaker 2:          01:11:13       There's something engaging about the style in which he presents these things. It's very captivating because very charismatic. I agree. People discount that. Or I know a lot of scientists who were kind of jealous of Neil degrasse Tyson or say Bill Nye. It's like, oh, I could do that. No, I doubt that you can. I mean, Neil and bill are really entertaining. They are funny. They are engaging. You can't take your eyes off. Then they're so much fun to watch. Well, perfect example is people are not like that. Sean Carroll's brilliant. He's really brilliant and I'm glad that he's doing a podcast now, but when you listen to him talk and you listen to neil talk, Neil just has this booming presence and this sense of drama and energy and entertainment. He knows how to be. He, he, he knows how to deliver it in a way that just catches you.

Speaker 2:          01:12:02       It's fun to listen to. And I did a public event in Australia and in Melbourne or Sydney and I, unfortunately I went before him and maybe that's actually good a. and I'm a pretty good public speaker. I have a sense of, you know, my value as a public speaker. I'm pretty good. But uh, and I never seen him speak and I, and I did my talk, like my pretty much like my ted talk you can watch online. It's pretty entertaining. Okay. So I get up and I'm done. I get a nice applause. I'm feeling pretty good and then neil gets up and he starts. I'm like, Oh crap, this guy is fucking good and you don't want to follow that. I know. I'm so glad I already went and got so much energy. Uh, and, and yeah, but he also has that sort of charisma connection with the audience.

Speaker 2:          01:12:46       A captures them and yeah, I could tell afterwards, you know, wrongs of people around him and you know, it's there and not very many people had that and I don't think it's something you can just learn. I think it's a temperament, you know, I mean you can hone it and refine it, but he can't just sort of naturally be funny and engaging. I think it's personality that comes out. I think you could certainly improve, but I think you're right. I think whatever personality you have, like he has that kind of engaging, fun personality and it's, it translates very well to doing those public speeches. Since I was here a year ago, I saw Jordan's event at a in thousand oaks at the Kavli theater there in 2000 seats sold out standing room only. And it was good. He was like different than Neil of course, but just as engaging wasn't political.

Speaker 2:          01:13:35       A lot of people there I, you know, recognized me and I could see, you know, these aren't like right wing nuts, these aren't young mailed, angry males. This isn't like this at all. And his message was pretty straightforward and get your life in order, you know, this is the way life is. It's hard. And he kind of went through his thing and it's like, all right, that makes sense. And people loved it. Very almost no politics in it. Dave Rubin tells me he doesn't really get political on stage, so that's not the motive. And uh, I think, you know, life is hard enough for most people that they, they like back to the self help thing.

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       It's nice to be reminded, here are a few simple things you could do. You get your life in order is like, yeah, well, yeah, I kinda knew that I'm going to go back out and do that again. His principles are very effective to. So they're very straightforward as you said, but what the guy like people goes, you know, to bring it back to that. What, what could he do if he does get fired, it's going to be very difficult for him to get a job at another university. He's obviously got roots in Portland. He lives there now. It's the whole thing is he's pretty liberal. It's not like he's a closeted conservative and thereafter him, he's definitely more liberal than me and I could tell even years ago that, uh, they're gonna, they're gonna go after him. I can tell mainly because he's so. He puts truth and free speech ahead of political positions.

Speaker 1:          01:14:57       He'll, he might say, I'm a liberal and these are my political positions, but more important to me is the truth. Yes. Okay. Well that's not as Jonathan make point points out in his book. Universities are now at this divide between are we here for social justice or are we here for truth and they're having to make a decision and too many of them are going for it. We're here for social justice. Well then just be honest about it because that's not. You can't bury it. Well, not just that. I don't think that's an effective way to pursue so social justice. If you're ignoring the truth, you undermine your message because then it's not like it's hidden somewhere. It's not like people can't read into it and see exactly what you've said and how you've supported certain causes and denied the reality of others, but the.

Speaker 1:          01:15:43       The, the Google memo thing. Yeah. The Google memo thing was a gigantic disaster. Yeah, because ideologically people jumped on a side and argued and and I heard the CEO of Youtube talk about how damaging it was to women. I'm like, what are you talking about? Like what are you saying? Like what? What did he say? He's just talking about preferences that are described by tests. This is, this has all been peer reviewed, studied papers on the differences between the preferences of males versus females. It's not, it's not like a value assessment at all and in fact, not only that he put into his paper a page and a half of recommendations of how to get certain women interested in tech and perhaps you could recruit certain way and make it more palatable or exciting to them and that's not a sexist screened at all. No, no, no.

Speaker 1:          01:16:35       There's online. There's a really good debate with Steve. Steven pinker in, in a, in a feminist scholar at Harvard and Steve has all his slides up there and he just goes all through all the different things that are in that Google memo. This is before the Google memo, May, maybe James more gut, some of that from pinker's lecture, but it's, it's, it's pretty solid stuff. There was nothing in inflammatory about the debate. This is kind of normal scientific debate, you know, here's a study that shows this well, but there's this other study and then they go at it. Okay. And to story, we're not saying women are better, men are better. That doesn't happen. Unfortunately.

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       The here, if I was [inaudible] boss, here's what I would do because a lot of us have written letters in support of Pete and you can kind of see what's about to happen. Let's just drop this whole thing. Let him keep his job, keep our mouths shut because this is going to backfire on us. Big Time lag did with evergreens. Yeah. Or with the Google memo. So that's what I would do. Backfire on the Google memo. I mean we've realized that they've got a preposterous ideology over there. Now we know that maybe their stock price hasn't gone down. Actually it affected them very much and, and, and many more people support it. Many more people who. It's one of those things where you hear one version of it and that version sticks, you know, it's like, you know, this is the version is he's a sexist, you know, the sex is Google memo and then that's all I need.

Speaker 3:          01:17:59       The Google memo is very sexist, very anti female. And being. There's many, many people who support the idea that something that was sexist was removed from Google. They've made it a safer environment for women. Right? Yep. But did they idle, you know, I don't know what this doesn't seem like they did. It seems like they made it an environment where you have to be careful about facts. Right? Because again, it's not a value assessment of women. If women choose to go into the medical fields, more women are physicians, more women. There's many fields that like disproportionately attract women. That's not a negative value assessment. That's just people are different, you know, I don't, I don't want to do with certain people do because I'm different than them. I don't. I'm not attracted to those fields. Right. It's fascinating to find out why people are attracted and when you see that there's actual.

Speaker 3:          01:18:52       There's just actual statistics in terms of what fields men are more attracted to or what fields women are more attracted to. Now on the other hand, if there's a reason why women aren't attracted those fields because they get harassed when they go into them, well that should be demonstrated and that's an APP, obviously a bad thing and that should be addressed. Yeah, absolutely. Totally. That's not what he's talking about. And James Demore is like a very kind, soft spoken. He's great. He's a great guy. He's very introverted. He's a kind guy and he's on the spectrum somewhere. There's no way you'd look at James Amaury got fares. The patriarchy. Yeah. He's a nice guy and they said to him, if you have any input on these things and feel like you can help, please contribute. And he's like, okay. So he's. That's what he is. He's a, he's a fucking software engineer.

Speaker 3:          01:19:41       He sat down and looked at all the data and compiled it and he's saying, well actually it seems like this is the reason why women are more attracted to other jobs and this is the reason why men are more attracted to these fields and they're like, sexist lead. He's like, no, no, no, no, no, no. These are the studies. This is what you're asking me to do, that the concern that if the science doesn't come out a certain way, then people won't be treated equally is a bad idea because then you're going to force the science to be distorted

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       if it doesn't match your political ideology, and that's so whether trans is natural or whatever percentages or how old you have to be before you get trans surgery and the hormones or whatever that. That's a raging debate right now, but under, under underlying that debate is like we have to make it come out in a way that trans people are treated equally. It's like, no, no. They should be treated equally anyway, regardless of what the science says, but, um, that, that's, that's a problem now. Now the problem for people, a peed and Brett like joining a think tank is almost all these think tanks are politically affiliated left or right. You have to bet and therefore you have to kind of tow the political line. This is our ideology in this thing tank and you're going to write white papers and op eds and send them out with our kind of slant, the problem with that as well, but what if I disagree with this and this and this here? Well then you can't work here. Something like that. So that's the problem with those. Is that

Speaker 3:          01:21:06       the only option today when you see that, I mean, I know he's not Jordan and you know, there's very few people like Jordan, but Sam Harris is also able to do these species very compelling as well. He's doing a lot of public speeches and doing these big, big events. There's more opportunity to do alternative things now than they have ever been before and I would hope that that becomes available to look. I hope Pete just keeps his job, but if he can't keep his job at Portland state, I would hope that some other avenue, some other, some other path as possible. Yep.

Speaker 2:          01:21:41       It might be. You know, you never know, but you know, you put a date on the calendar and you tell the world, did they come? Do they pay 10 bucks a ticket, 50 bucks a ticket, $100 a ticket. Not many people can fill a 3000 seat auditorium or a 500 seat auditorium in

Speaker 3:          01:21:56       do is do a lecture series on the Grievance Studies and have the three of them onstage talk about how silly these things were.

Speaker 2:          01:22:06       Yeah. If they could put that together as a theatrical presentation, it would really be funny because there's some hot alaria subjects covered. Oh, they have to do is just read with porcelain

Speaker 3:          01:22:15       [inaudible] and we're in here and we were talking about these things. We were crying laughing. It was really, really funny stuff. That's actually probably the best path for him. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:22:24       Is to put together some sort of a public show. They should do a book and then have a book to show. Yeah. And then maybe even a TV documentary about it. Well, if they have somebody making a document, that's a good start. And when I was in College at Pepperdine, g Gordon Liddy and Timothy leary did a stage show. Wow. And they were. And they were touring the country doing this. Yeah. And it was at Ucla, so I drove down and saw it and it was so entertaining. I mean, g dot Gordon Liddy, he's the man there with his three piece suit and he's got his gun and Timothy leary comes out in his boat shoes and his flower shirt and, but they had it kind of scripted, but it was well scripted in a way that

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       seemed kind of spontaneous, but it was really funny and educational about how the government works and freedom versus security and rights. And uh, I thought that was brilliant and I think they did, I don't know, like a 50 city tour of that g Gordon Liddy was on fear factor. He was. Oh, I didn't know that. Interesting. Did he hold his hand above a flame? No, he didn't. But we did hang him by his ankles and slam them into a pool like over and over and over again. It was, I forget what the stunt was, but I was like, Jesus, this guy's old to be doing this. But, uh, he did, uh, some physical challenges. I remember thinking like this guy is more fit and more active than most young people, and he was deep into his sixties at the time when we had them on fear factor, the only thing that screwed them up was in the end, the final stunt was a driving stunt and it was at night and unfortunately his eyes are not that good and he just couldn't see well without glasses and so as he was driving the car slammed into something or something.

Speaker 1:          01:24:02       You know what it was? What do you got them there now it's all right, but a chance to talk to him for a few days hanging out with them. Very interesting guy. You have a strong mind. Yep, that's right. He had a talk show back in the nineties. I was on when my first book came out. White people believe weird things and I talked about conspiracies there and so he asked me, well, tell me about conspiracies. They. Well, you tell me about conspiracy. You know more than I do. He knows about real ones. Real ones. Yeah. That is my number one beef with conspiracy theories, is that when you, you know, some of them that are so preposterous, like whether it's flatter, if or what were the really dumb ones, there's a base on the opposite side of the moon and Nasa knows about all the aliens are living in New Mexico, the lizard people.

Speaker 1:          01:24:45       The problem with those is they undermine actual conspiracies when you, when you hear about preposterous things and they they get, they get categorized as conspiracy theories. Then when someone says, well, there's a conspiracy about this. Well, it's already a tainted idea because the word conspiracy is connected to nonsense, right? Because there's so many nonsense conspiracy theories. It's hard to recognize, oh, something like Enron that really did happen. Like there, there is the northwoods papers, there's a bunch of like legitimate conspiracies. You're like, wow, you know, you find out about the Gulf of Tonkin. You're like, well, they really did that. Yup, that's right. Yeah. I'm writing a paper now and white people believe conspiracies and so I go through the whole list of all the psychological things, but I am with the whole second half is because a lot of them are true and there are reasons we should be suspicious that just think of, uh, the wiki leaks or the Panama papers, the Panama papers. Here's all these billionaires opening these shell corporations keeping their mind. They're not paying tech. That's a conspiracy, you know, by definition to them are people meeting in secret to conspire to benefit themselves that harms the public good or other people. This happens a lot and the US government in corporations, there's a reason we should be suspicious. There is. But what is it about people want to look for

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       a conspiracy and everything, even if it's, you know, they want to see, they want to see contreras behind jets as evidence of the government spraying things in the sky to control our minds. Right? So the sort of Baloney detection tools are not too finely tuned. Uh, the problem is, is that we're a tendency is to look for some global, simple explanation for complex systems. So while we all kind of recognize, yes, we know corporations cheat and stock traders trade with insight information, but that's kind of small and mundane. It's not very interesting. Global domination of the world know this is, Ooh, who's doing that? You know, so then it becomes like a Dan Brown novel. It's more compelling as a narrative story about how the world works. It's super simple. There's these 12 guys in London called the Illuminati and they're calling the shots and they're, you know, they're controlling Oldenburg, the builder Burgers, the Rockefellers, the last child, the Illuminati CFR new world order towards Soros is doing it.

Speaker 2:          01:27:06       He's a part of it. Totally. It's what I hear. He's number 13 in the Illuminati. There's so many different competing theories to so, so, so a couple of criteria. The more people that have to be involved, the less likely it is to be true. It was Gordon Liddy that told me this, that, you know, it was, it. Three people can keep a secret if two of them are dead now people can't keep their mouth shut. And also he would know because he worked in government. Most people are pretty incompetent. So the idea that you can orchestrate a thousand people to and each of them is going to go out and do this one thing at 9:00 Tuesday and it's all gonna come together just perfect because impossible and he should know. I mean they couldn't even break into the Watergate hotel room to get these papers. What's also, who is getting into government the first place?

Speaker 2:          01:27:50       Are they the geniuses of the world, the heads of their field? Or are they people that just decided to get into a job? You know, and this is, this is a good percentage of the people that are involved in government. If those people know as well, these unexceptional folks that are just like uninspired. And there were also, they're like, they, that's the air quotes day that they really have the kind of wherewithal to control the whole world mind control. That's my favorite mind control psyops. I mean, this idea that, um, you know, operatives went into the World Trade Center buildings, both of them, two of the most tightly controlled and secure buildings in the world and under the pretense of working on the elevators, managed to get into a breakthrough, the drywall to get into the main beams, to wrap them up in explosive devices. This thermite stuff, and this would, you know, we know how long it takes to demolish a, like a stadium or a big building, you know that they work, they're there for weeks or months preparing all the explosive devices. Somehow they did this in the World Trade Center building without anyone noticing. Not to mention all the people that worked on this, they never told their spouses are friends or buddies or what they were doing or they didn't mention it to anybody.

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       They don't want to go on CNN or 60 minutes ago I saw something and here's what happened. Nobody. Well, anytime you have a gigantic catastrophe like that, just a gigantic, horrific event, there's so many emotions. There's so much chaos. There's so much going on that you're going to get a bunch of really wacky eye witness accounts because people just aren't good at remembering things when, when they're under extreme duress and mrs fact they hear things, they remember explosions, they see things that aren't necessarily what was really in front of them and that's just the human memory is one of the most flawed ways of gathering information, right? It's terrible. We have terrible memories, right? And everything. Once something happens, then you back up and look for all the sort of pregnant moments leading up to it that otherwise would have been a noticeable like, uh, at the JFK assassination.

Speaker 1:          01:29:57       There's a famous story about the umbrella man. Yeah. Okay. So there is, it's a clear sunny day. Why does he have an umbrella? And for decades there you go online, you can see these examples of how the umbrella could have been turned into a rifle. And then he shot like that and, and it. Anyway, somebody finally tracked this guy down decades later and he said, I was out there protesting Kennedy. The umbrella was a protest. And that stems back to Neville Chamberlain coming back after meeting with Hitler before Hitler annexed, I think it was the sedate and land. And he came back and said, you know, holding his umbrella here I had here, Hitler sign this paper and promised he wouldn't do anything more bad. And so the umbrella became a symbol of um, you know, sort of caving into evil people or you know, uh, what's the word for it?

Speaker 1:          01:30:45       Uh, you know, appeasement. How convoluted do you think people are going to get that? And I dunno, he's out. So this is what he said I had my umbrella to because I didn't like what Kennedy was dealing with, Castro and the Cubans. Okay. So in other words, the umbrella meant nothing in terms of the assassination. Right? And this is true. So like nine slash 11. Oh, there was this little puff of smoke or somebody found this passport over here, this little thing. All those little things. Really. It's just randomness. Well, the other thing is the people that want to think that the windows blowing out or indicative of some sort of a controlled demolition or the building's caving in it, the floor pancaking it pushes the air out. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's. There's never been a controlled demolition that went from the top down either like the way they did it.

Speaker 1:          01:31:31       They all go from the bottom up, right? Yeah. It's the one that looks crazy as a building seven tower seven. That one looks crazy. It does, but it burned for like eight hours or something and yeah, that one's just slightly fuzzier, but explosive experts tell me that it's fully explicable by burning all day. Well also when you see the images of it collapsing, what you don't see is the interior structure had collapsed previously and there's video of that when you watched the interior cave in and that as this fire was burning because apparently there was obviously, I don't know what really what happened, but there was diesel tanks apparently in the basement and the diesel fuel at burn, incredibly hot in the whole inside of it all. The structure had been completely weakened and then as it collapsed it just all gave out. It just happened to be a shit design.

Speaker 1:          01:32:23       If I was the guy who owned that building, I would sue everybody. I mean he got his money back I guess because there's some insurance money, but that what a terrible design. There was some issue with the legal insurance payout to the owner of the World Trade Center buildings. Whether this was like one event or two events are one building or two. What was the difference was between like 8 billion, $16,000,000,000 payout or something like that. How do they get people to get into that new building? I'd be like, fuck you. I'm not. I'm not renting an office in this building, this building. They blew it up in [inaudible] 93. They blew it up again in 2001 get out of here with this shit. I'm not taking chances of this new ass building. What is it? The freedom tower or something like that. It's just a big old bullseye. Yup.

Speaker 1:          01:33:10       Yeah. I haven't been in it yet. I've been around it, but it's not even that big. Well, it's. I think it's just. I think it's taller than the. It's not. It's not as big as the original towers. Right? I think it is as tall it isn't. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. I thought it was shorter. It's definitely not as big as the one in Dubai. The Dubai ones, like a half a mile, right? Isn't something crazy like that. I don't know how tall is the tallest building? It is. I just went to their, the one world trade center leasing page, it says at 1,776 feet. One World Trade Center is the tallest l, e e d gold certified building in the Western Hemisphere. That's not good enough. Whatever America, we need to believe, number one, and we need to go straight to the moon. In the solar system. Yeah. We need to take an elevator right to the fucking moon.

Speaker 1:          01:33:55       Right. Outside of space. How is that possible? Can they build a building that's so high that it goes into space one? Yeah. I don't think so because structurally it wouldn't hold, went up, so can shape of a pyramid. Well, it's like why are trees 100 feet tall? Because the material would just collapse. I don't think he could have it strong. It'd have to be so fat. Oh, that's right. Japan was going to build that space elevator. Oh, look at it. You Got Jack with the popups. Japan takes tiny first step towards space. Elevator. Yeah. You can fuck off. I'm not getting nothing. It would take a few years before I'm willing to climate or that soccer. But um, so the other problem with conspiracies just get back there for a moment is the problem of anomalies. What do you do with anomalies? This is true in all science.

Speaker 1:          01:34:38       No theory explains every single thing that's out there that we want to study. There's always going to be some quirky thing that the main theory here that explains all these things here. It doesn't account for that. Okay. What did we do with that? Well, my joke is you assign it to a Grad student. They let them figure it out. But what outsiders mistake is that, well my theory explains this, a little anomaly, so therefore it should replace this theory and so people like Neil and Sean Carroll, Lawrence Krauss, Michio Kaku has to web pages. One is a link on his webpage. If you have an alternative theory of physics, go to this page. So they go there and it has your theory has to explain all of these things over here that are theory currently explains and your whatever your said anomaly is. And of course they can't.

Speaker 1:          01:35:26       So it's not that scientists are dogmatically closed minded to the anomalies. It's that we can't explain everything and you don't have to do anything with that. Just just leave it there. Maybe eventually they'll pile up and there'll be a new theory like with Einstein's relativity. Okay. There was enough anomalies here like the orbit of mercury and a few other things. And so we have to modify Newtonian physics a little bit. Okay. That happens. But for the most part. And so conspiracies are filled with these things. Like the moment something big happens, you go back and okay, but there was this weird thing here. How he explained that, I don't know, we don't have to explain everything. Do you know that there's a growing movement that think that the space is fake spaces fake? No. Is this different than the flat earth rule? Hashtag [inaudible] basis. Fake Hashtag spaces.

Speaker 1:          01:36:19       Fave is people that are so fucking stupid. The flat earthers kicked him out. Oh my God. For real flat earthers kicked out the space. Fake people spaces fake is like God. They are the most skeptical. So what would be the upper atmosphere would be the edge. It's all bullshit. It's all fake. It's the end and it's tied in some weird way to religion, which is really interesting because even the flat earth people, there's a tremendous amount of them that are extremely religious and they talk about the firmament and the Bible book, the Bible, and that this is a. This is what's really going on is that they're trying to keep us from the knowledge that God has created. This place is a very special place and so by pretending that it's round, they somehow or another are controlling us. We're thinking that we're not exceptional and we're not lucky.

Speaker 1:          01:37:06       Space is fake. They're using a video from Ryan Gosling's movie he just made about Neil Armstrong. First Man on the moon. Just be like this. Look, look. Here's proof. It's a fake everything. They are making a movie because literally the way they made the movie is that's evidence that it's fake. That because he's wearing it. I don't know if maybe this person doesn't recognize that as being Ryan gosling right there. Scott got NASA suit on. Maybe it's just a troll account. This is how NASA fix everything. This is the video I was talking about guys. Now you know it's all a big act tab. Click on spaces fake though. This is what I'm on. I'm on the whole click on it because there's a bunch of other mom on that thread. There's a tremendous amount of people that literally believe that space is not real. Google a video of a buzz Aldrin and how deals with the

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       no Mooney's that we never went to the moon. There's a video buzz Aldrin punching a guy. That guy, I had dinner with that guy. Did the guy who punched. Yeah, I was a firm believer that we never went to the moon. This is what happened. I watched that. A Fox documentary, the moon conspiracy theory did we go and I was like, Holy Shit. Because it was on television and I was. And this was 96, 97. I remember I went to work and I told everybody, you got to see this documentary. It crazy. We never went to the moon. And uh, I have watched that one and I watched this guys. What is his name? Artsy fartsy liberal. So I had dinner with them. He absolutely believes that we never went to the moon. Not 100 percent believes it. I don't know if he still believes it.

Speaker 3:          01:38:40       I think he's like a cab driver or something. Now he got, he was involved in the news or local television or something like that backwards from then he released a documentary called the funny, a funny thing happened on the way to the moon. And in his documentary, one of the things he did have his really interesting footage of the lunar module where it looks like they're faking a shot of them being really far out, but then when they remove this, cover, the covers from all the windows that were inside the, the um, the lunar, not the lunar module. What is the one that the orbiter, it really looks like they're in low earth orbit and this is like the main thing pointing to that, like they couldn't get out of low earth orbit. Then there was also the fact that they lost all of the telemetry data, which was the binary ones and zeroes that show the position of the lunar module at every stage.

Speaker 3:          01:39:38       There was a bunch of different things. The fact that no one wanted, especially Neil Armstrong, he became a recluse. Never wanted to talk about it. You go and watch the press conference, the press conference. They look very shady, look like they're completely not like that. He talks to everybody. He was a drunk for a long time though. He was a. He was very depressed and had when he became an alcoholic after the moon landing. And the idea is that in conspiracy circles from talking as them, the idea is that he got over it after awhile and needed to make a living. Now talks about it constantly. But Neil Armstrong never did. The thing that's compelling is that there was, there were some, there's some faking going on. If you look at Gemini was in Gemini Fifteen, Michael Collins, there's an image of Michael Collins when they were testing some of the space, uh, walking stuff and some of the, uh, some of the things that they would do to, to walk outside of a spaceship.

Speaker 3:          01:40:34       Um, they, they had them all strapped up with cables and they're just experimented with these things. They took that photograph and then blacked out the background, probably some overzealous pr agent. And they were like in the pool right here. So what it is, is like, so the, the first one is clearly he's, you know, in a studio and they're working on things and just trying to understand how all this stuff works. And the second one, they took the exact same photo and just reversed it and blacked out the background and they put. This just doesn't mean that they didn't go to the moon. That just means that someone got ahold of some photographs and faked it and it's way more likely that there was more of that going on then that people didn't actually go to the moon. Right? Yeah. Yeah. The thing about going to the moon that's really interesting is if they can go again and they do go again and they find all that stuff there, you know, then everybody has to just go, oh yeah, I guess we were all this stuff is.

Speaker 3:          01:41:34       I mean there's, there's instruments on there that we still monitor that the Apollo astronauts left there. Well then we monitor, we monitor, we shoot a laser up there and bounces off. Yeah. But you know, a laser will also bounce off the surface of the moon. Yeah. But I don't think like they're not as precise. Right, right. Yeah. But the Russians did that too with the lunker hood. One and two. I believe they left a solar roof or laser reflectors up there as well with the unmanned Mr Japan has a video footage as far as of like last week. Yeah. First out of the dark side of the. So that's all fake too. They will spaces fake dude. There's no space. Of course. The moon's not even. What is the moon? If space is fake, how did they explain that? The images. What's interesting is the images of the dark side of the moon look exactly like even like the landing and the whole setup looks very similar to the Apollo missions.

Speaker 3:          01:42:22       So they would have to either be in cahoots or have worked together with NASA. Sound Studio? Yeah. To figure that he the old stuff. Yeah, look at it. I mean this is the footage. I mean, God damn, that looks eerily similar to what you saw when the Apollo astronauts were there. I think it is entirely possible that some of the, um, some of the practice film footage of them, you know, on the surface or doing things turned out to be pushed out as actual footage of moon landings. I think there was no television back then. There was no internet, there was no vcrs, there was no ability to review things and watched them over again. They projected something on television one time and that was it. So when they released pressed releases and videos, it's entirely possible that some of those videos that got through were actually just tests. It's entirely possible that there was just like the Michael Collins photos that there was some fuckery going on. You're dealing with so many human beings, you're dealing with. So many people see an estimated 530 million people watch Armstrong's televised image and heard his voice describe. Okay. What does that. It was broadcasted live like six hours that day. Yes. Yeah. It was actually broadcasted live on a projection screen. What they did was they didn't get a straight feed. They were filming the footage that was on a projection screen. That's how they did it and there's some wonky

Speaker 1:          01:43:51       shit that looks like they fall down and then they get pulled back up by wires when they're on the surface of the moon, but again, I think how much of that is. How much, how much of that is actual footage of them being on the moon and how much of that is just test footage? I mean, I don't know. I don't know. Um, I'm not sure about that, but I think also, uh, I don't know Jack Shit about space travel. I don't know anything about astrophysics. I don't know anything about like what it takes to land on the moon and come back and whether or not. And most of the people that talk about this don't know that mythbusters did a nice episode on did you know, did we fake going to the moon? And they showed a bunch of little things. For example, on the moon with its gravity when you, he goes something like that into the dust, you know, the particles come up and they arch back down in a certain way that it would be different than if you are on earth so that gravity is different.

Speaker 1:          01:44:42       Causes the dust to settle a different way. There was a bunch of things like that that proves we were there. Well, it certainly proved that what took place took place in a vacuum. Yet, not yet, and a gravitational pull the same as the moon. The only, um, you've probably seen the feather in the hammered drunk yet, but you know, you can do that here. Well, a yes in a vacuum. Yes, that's right. Yeah. But, uh, but even a feather in a hammer, even if it's, it depends upon what kind of feather it is, but a feather and a hammer, even if you just held them here and dropped him on the ground, they probably would landed a very similar pace. Favorite. There's a spoof video about that. We never went to the moon, but couple of British comedians that, that Kubrick thing is that with the Kubrick one, no appeal.

Speaker 1:          01:45:29       Uh, what's their name? I forget key and Peele key and Peele. Yeah. So the, the, the three of them are talking and you know, okay, we're going to fake this whole thing. And, and, uh, and then the troubleshooters, she's like, well, I'm now, you know, people are going to ask, well how did we go to the moon? And we're going to have to, you know, build a big rocket. So we can say, well we went into that big rocket and they're like, well how much would it cost to build that big rocket? Well, it would be really expensive. I mean we might as well just go to the moon and then they started talking about the expenses, but we only have to feed three of them if we go to the moon. But if we shoot it as a shoot here in the studio, we're gonna have to have catering for everybody to be super expensive.

Speaker 1:          01:46:02       It kind of goes on like that. It's very funny. That is funny. But the conspiracy theorists would say, well they couldn't send someone to the moon so they had to fake it. That's why they haven't been back. Right. They went from 1969 to 1973. Is that what it was? Six successful missions, seven attempts. Apollo 13 being the one that didn't make it. It's a, it's a fun theory. And what happened with me is I got way better at spotting bullshit and learning critical thinking skills and then paying attention to all sides. And I mean the, the, the real issue with something like that is if someone could prove definitively beyond a shadow of a doubt that not only is it impossible that no one ever went to the moon, absolutely prove it. That would be giant. Yep. I mean really would be. I mean, it would be a huge story, but Ken, is it even possible to do that?

Speaker 1:          01:46:56       You know, the other analogy I use with the Wiki leaks is there of all those tens of thousand, hundreds of thousands of memos and papers and letters and government documents. There's not one mention anywhere of nine slash 11 was an inside job, you know, and we had to allocate these funds to go to this construction company who was then seen working at the World Trade Center. But nothing like that. So that in this case, the absence of evidence is evidence of absence didn't happen. Not an inside job. And the sign 11 one and something like that would be true for the moon landing. I mean, all those people that worked on that, not one of them saw anything and wanted to write a book on 60 minutes. The idea would be that there was compartmentalized and that everyone, like say if you're working on theo rings, you don't have access to the people that are working on the thrusters.

Speaker 1:          01:47:43       If you have access to this, you don't have access to that. And that there was only a very small group of people that controlled everything. Also 19, 69 was a very different environment in terms of like what you get away with and not get away with what you could say. It's just, it was really fun. It was really fun to believe that they fake going into the bone and I spent an inordinate amount of time, uh, looking at it, but I completely dropped it. I dropped it after. I just, I paid attention to what I actually know. So, but now you can kind of empathize with those who do believe theories because. Oh yeah, but you want to hear a dumber one? Yeah. Here's a dumber one. For the longest time, like months, I believed in a thing called rods. Do you know the tiny little insects?

Speaker 1:          01:48:26       Yes. Well they would it this guy put out this duck is documentary that there was these things flying so fast we couldn't see them with the naked eye and that they were like jellyfish, like creatures that lived amongst us and they had all this video footage of the. Especially these people that were jumping. There were sky diving into this enormous cave in Mexico and has there been sky diving into this cave. You see those things flying back and forth and I was hook, line and sinker. I was like, oh my God, these things are around us all the time. I was going outside and looking up trying to spot them like imagine this, these beings that are flying so fast so we can't. We can't see them. The only way you capture it was on camera and then a show called monster quest cracked the riddle, right?

Speaker 1:          01:49:12       They show that it's an a video artifact and then if you have really high speed camera, you just see the insect, but if you have low speed standard definition video cameras, it creates this artifact as these things pass by very close to the lens at a high rate of speed, it elongates their video signal and it makes them look like, like this jellyfish type thing, but it's really just a video artifact. Yeah. Again, it's a good example of anomalies. You know, here's this weird video anomaly. What is it about? Just say, I don't know. Well, if you don't know anything about video, it's way easier. Say, oh,

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       that's the capture, right? Yeah. You know, take a camera, put it outside. You will capture these things. Amazing,

Speaker 2:          01:49:53       right? Yeah, that's right. The other aspect of conspiracy theories is cognitive dissonance. That is we want the size of the event to be matched by a cause that's equally have that size. So the analogy I use is you know the Holocaust, the worst genocide and human history caused by the Nazis, the worst bridge iem political regime and human history. There's a match there, but if you say something like, uh, you know, jfk, the leader of the free world brought down by who? He Harvey Oswald. Just some nobody, you know, there's this mismatch or nine slash 11 is huge thing by 19 guys with box cutters. Do you think that. Doesn't Harvey Oswald acted alone? Yeah. What makes you think that? All of the evidence and not none of the evidence against anybody else and all of the evidence against particularly him, the general posner's book case closed. And then the attorney. What's his name? That was the, uh,

Speaker 3:          01:50:46       attorney

Speaker 2:          01:50:48       he, his name. He has a massive book where he lines up every single one of the arguments by the JFK conspiracy for example, because just make a big deal about how Oswaldo got a job at the book depository building, which just happened to be where the parade just happened to be where the parade route was going. So you get to have a clear shot. So it was positive that track down when the White House determined even when Kennedy was going to Dallas, let alone what the parade route would be. An oswell already had the job there. That's just chance. So he knew it advanced bro. He knew that you needed, or do you think it's possible?

Speaker 3:          01:51:23       Well, that Oswald was in cahoots? No, no, no. Why do you think that? What about the magic bullet theory?

Speaker 2:          01:51:31       Well, that's been settled by the fact that the way it showed in the videos is that the two seats are like this and at the bullet has to do this. Well. In fact the seats were like that and that connolly was.

Speaker 3:          01:51:42       You're explaining this. I'm in audio form just when you're saying. Oh yeah, so it's like stadium seating. One's elevated above the other. That's right. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:51:49       So the bullet actually, when it passes through the neck through Kennedy's neck and then hits Connolly's shoulder it, it is already moving.

Speaker 3:          01:51:57       We get to his wrist at fraction is roasted, right? The. This has been tested and tested and tested. Well, sort of. Here's, here's my issue with it. There's a couple issues. One on the, on the pro side, the idea that bullets we'll take a straight path is ridiculous. I've, I've, I've talked to hunters that have shot animals in the front and had a bullet come out the same side. They shot it and it ricocheted off bones and came out like the front of the animal, like bullets take weird paths when they hit things in particular. Uh, so to arrows they take as a person who's well versed in firearms and shot animals and hunted this. You don't. Sometimes the bullet goes straight through and sometimes it hits bones and wacky things happen. Things deflect. But on the negative side they always distort. Bullets always distort, particularly when they hit bone, but bothered me was that they found that bullet in Connolly's Gurney.

Speaker 3:          01:52:56       When they brought him to the hospital, they just conveniently found this bullet. Aha, we have it. This is the bullet that matches the same rifle and but it wasn't pristine. It was flattened. Barely. If you look at that bullet, that bullet does nothing like a bullet that hit bone. When bullets hit bone, they mushroom, they balloon, they bend, they distort wildly. They don't come out looking like that. They come out looking like that when you shoot them into water or when you shoot them into like feathers, they don't come out looking like that under normal circumstances when they shattered the bone of two different people. Well to you know that for sure. No, I do not know that for sure. But um, one thing I do know a lot about is I know quite a bit about what bullets look like when they hit things.

Speaker 3:          01:53:38       I've looked into this pretty extensively and I've talked to a lot of people in law enforcement, military hunters, and none of them believed that that bullet hit bones, shattered. Bones came out looking like that. Is it possible that that bullet was the only bullet ever in the history of the world that did do that? Yeah, it might be. Okay. So we're getting kind of caught up in the weeds of the anomalies. What about this? Just a bullet. Oswald himself had attempted to assassinate a general name Walker six months before with his rifle and a handgun and he went over to the house. He took a shot through the guys when he saw him at the desk, took a shot, missed him. He told his wife about it. I'm a revolutionary. I'm trying to start stuff. Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that Oswald was innocent.

Speaker 3:          01:54:23       I'm not. I mean, I think it's very possible that Oswald did shoot at the president. He might've even hit the president. It's very possibly that some other people were involved as well, who, I don't know. Say this is the problem, but wait a minute, why is it a problem if you don't know who they are? Just because you don't know who they are doesn't mean it didn't exist, but why do we need to postulate extra people? Because of all the gunshots that happened in a short amount of time. The fact that the reason why they came up with the theory of the magic bullet in the first place, because they had to account for a bullet that hit a curb underneath the overpass. Do you know that? Right? Yeah. Okay. There's three. There's okay. If you know why they came out with them. I. Yeah, I've been there.

Speaker 3:          01:55:00       Do you know why they came up with, but it's short. I mean, it's right there. You could not miss the point was that, that's sort of true. Yeah. It's not a far shot. And he was a pretty good marksman. A positive track down is. We're not talking about that. We're talking about the reason why they came up with the magic bullet theory in the first place. Do you know what? Well, I thought it was because, uh, of the alignment of the seats. No, because they had to attribute three shots. They had to figure out in one of them they were, they were thinking, well, they all have these wounds. Came from three bullets, but then they found a bullet that had hit the curb on the underside and got checked into a hospital because he was hitting the ricochet. So there's a curb that they proved was hit with a bullet. There was a bullet hole in the granite or whatever the fuck the curbs made out of it. Hit this guy.

Speaker 1:          01:55:43       He went to the hospital. So he was hit with a ricochet. So they knew that one bullet had not hit the president, and so they had to attribute all of these wounds to one bullet. Now they had one bullet that landed into his neck, another bullet that hit him in the head. So how do these three bullets cause a wound timely as well. Then they came up with the map. There's, there's the bullet look at that bullet, but you have to look at this at the end. It's flattened. If you look at it from the end. No, it's not. Look at this. Under no circumstances do I feel that this bullet could hit a risks and still not be deformed. We proved that by experiments as a chief consultant in wound ballistics for the US army who supervised tests for the Warren Commission. Here's the thing, I don't.

Speaker 1:          01:56:26       I don't necessarily think that there was some grand conspiracy, but I do think it's entirely possible that someone took that posthumously, took that rifle and wanting to pin it on Lee Harvey Oswald definitively. Look, there's people that do things when they know someone's guilty and they plant evidence. Mark Furhman did that with Oj Simpson. They found his glove and they, they planted evidence and there was one of the reasons why Oj got off because there was some sort of conspiring to make it look like he was, you know, it was the. The evidence was a clear path. They could have just taken that rifle and look, could've been that Oswald did it alone. It's possible, but also could have been this. Some other people were shooting at them too. It could have been that they had decided to have oswald be a part of this and when Jack Ruby ran in and shot them, that doesn't look a little suspicious at some guy with ties to the mob gets right up to this guy who just shot the president and shoots him like why?

Speaker 1:          01:57:19       That's never shot before. Do it publicly. Posner talks about Ruby's character and who he was, major kennedy supporter, a running with some bad dudes, some bread bad andres there in Texas and he was a gun owner. A security wasn't anything like it is now. He really could just walk right in like he did. It's possible, but it's also possible that that guy owed something to the mob and this is what they told them to do. Are you going to get rid of that guy? No one's going to care. They're going to be happy. Fuck, that guy just shot the president who seems so it seems like people want it to be one way or the other and they want, they want this case closed and be that way. I mean, Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy and that was evident pretty quickly afterwards and they rounded them up.

Speaker 1:          01:58:05       Uh, you know, World War One was launched by a conspiracy with the assassination of Franz Ferdinand by a Serbian group of, called the black hand, the group of nationalists while we were talking about the Vietnam War to the Gulf of Tonkin incident. False flag. So these things do happen. They're all false legs. There are conspiracies to assassinate foreign leaders. Uh, you know, hits, wrote this book. I'm Kissinger as a war criminal, uh, that, you know, all the shenanigans. We were doing it in South America with dictators. There were back in this take Taylor, because he's the son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch versus this guy and we're going to sas and a Castro. All the stuff that came out that Johnson

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       tried to cover up that came out in the Pentagon papers about Kennedy plotting to have Castro assassinated. That's a kind of conspiracies that this. Absolutely this does happen. The question is, did it happen in that particular case or this one or a year and the evidence, in my opinion, after reading particularly Gerald Posner is booked a case closed. It's funny. Internet meme that went around last week of a guy who dies, goes to heaven and God says you, you've been such a good fellow your whole life. I'll grant you one wish. She can ask me anything. He said, alright, who killed Kennedy? And God said it was Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone using his own Kokona rifle and the guy goes, this goes higher up than I thought.

Speaker 3:          01:59:27       That's funny, man. Did you ever read David Lifton's novel or a book about it rather? Yeah. Best evidence. Best evidence.

Speaker 2:          01:59:35       So I didn't read the whole book when I was researching this back in the nineties when after the Oliver Stone film came out, because after that, when that came out, I thought, man, if only half of this or 10 percent of this is true, it's definitely a conspiracy. But then there are websites dedicated to everything he got wrong there.

Speaker 3:          01:59:53       Well, he made people up like the General Donald Sutherland character. That guy doesn't even exist. He just used him as a theatrical tool, very distorting film. And that film is such a powerful medium. It's hard to overcome that. Well, that movie in particular, you've got Kevin Costner, who's the good guy. Everybody loves it. Yeah. I mean that is a Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau too. Crazy movie. And it really has you believing that there's some sort of a continuous into the lip back into the left people. Well, here's the thing about that though. Well, I've looked at that over and over again. Yes it is back into the left, but the spray kind of comes out the front. Yeah, it is. Yeah. Yeah. It kinda comes out the front. And one thing that does happen when people or things get shot is you have nerves and nerves react and things. Things do weird, weird results in your body when if you get hit by something, it doesn't get his hands come up like that. Well, he's grabbing his neck. Apparently. That was the other thing was there was a difference in the autopsy results from Bethesda, Maryland versus in Dallas, Texas, Dallas, Texas. They attributed the throat, wound to a frontal shot at something. Hit him in the front. And then the Bethesda, Maryland, they said that it was a trait wound. They, uh, they opened them up to clear his breathing pathway. And then the conspiracy theorists will say, why would you clear the breathing pathway of a guy who doesn't have a brain spraying was shot out of his head.

Speaker 3:          02:01:22       I just don't like when people say they know one way or another, we harvey Oswald acted alone. Fuck. Could you know, there was a bunch of bull. There was also bullet fragments and Connolly's wrist that weren't missing from the bullet itself. The bullet itself, whether you think it's pristine or not, it's still, it's not missing a lot of fragments and there's fragments in Connolly's body that they. You could detect an x ray, there's x rays in his wrist and you could see the little pieces of the. I don't know what the explanation for that. The fact that, I don't know. I'm not the world's expert on this stuff. People want to clean it up. That's what I don't like. They want to clean it up or they want to muddy it up instead of like looking at it a hundred percent objectively, they want one thing or another.

Speaker 3:          02:02:02       I think it's entirely possible that Lee Harvey Oswald, it's either to me they want to say, this is the. These are the two narratives. Lee Harvey Oswald was a patsy. He had nothing to do with the government set him up or he acted alone, but why? Why couldn't he have been evolved in it? You know, he obviously was involved in some shady characters. The guy spent a ton of time in Russia, came back over here very easily. Even though the Cold War was going on. There's a lot of weird stuff. He might've very well been some sort of a government informant or working in cahoots with the government if that's the case, and he did shoot candidate or shoot at Kennedy, who's to say that he wasn't with other people and they killed him because this guy was going to go to jail and he was going to start talking. When they arrested him, he said, I'm a Patsy, patsy and then blam.

Speaker 3:          02:02:48       He's dead up. We got them and that's it. Wrap it up tight. It wasn't until the Zapruder film that people really started to question and I think that was. It might've been 10 years later. Right. We've talked about, you know, the whole history of the Zapruder film, how it was released. The Geraldo Rivera show, right. Crazy, right. Dick Gregory comedian brought the film footage to the Geraldo Rivera show and showed it on television for the First Time magazine, but the rights to life magazine had the rights and didn't do anything with it. They kept it for more than a decade. Dick Gregory got ahold of the actual film footage and premiered it on the Geraldo Rivera shall I want to say it was like 1971 or 72 or something like that, so it was way, way after the assassination that the American, what was it? Seventy five is 12 years old. That's crazy. Seventy five, so all those years later and then people got a chance to see the footage and they were like, wow, this is not how it was described to us at all and it made people skeptical.

Speaker 3:          02:03:47       There's a good Nova show on ballistics in the head and testing the rifle and could you shoot that many times and that many seconds and so on, and it's pretty cool. To me, it's pretty convincing. The problem with me is I know too much about what happens when bullets hit bones. I don't buy that. That was the bullet I do. Look, I think they could've just dropped that bullet off. It doesn't mean that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't do it. Thinking about that bullet though, is that there might be some fuckery involved and the David Liftin book was. That was the book that got me into conspiracies. That fucking book. God dammit. If I could go back and not read it. I bombed on stage because of that book you did? Yeah. Well it was my fault, but I've read that book the day I was performing and I was freaking out because I was like 24 or something like that. I was like, oh, this is crazy. They killed the president and I was so naive and

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       I was like really bummed out when I went onstage and then I realized like, oh, you can't. Like I didn't know any better. I've only been doing comedy for three years and you can't go on stage. Bombed out if you've got to get your head together. You can't just say the jokes and not have some emotional attachment to them, but that book highlights what it was was lifted, was a bookkeeper and an accountant, I believe, and he was hired to do something with the Warren Commission report and in it because he found some contradictions and he went over the entire Warren Commission report, which is an enormous, enormous publication, and he found all of these problems, all of these problems in the Warren Commission report and all of these contradictions. And it was his determination after reading everything in writing his book, he thought that the conclusion they made, they made before the fact and that they wrote all this stuff to sort of Vr the backup, their conclusion that it wasn't based entirely on an objective version of the facts of the event itself.

Speaker 1:          02:05:39       And his, his take was, there was a conspiracy. Well, it's launched a mini industry of books. It, man, think about all the money that's been made off of the Kennedy assassination. If you go down the rabbit hole with this stuff, do you ever see the Jesse Ventura version of it? Uh, he believes that he is the best. It was on his computer spirits he show. Yeah, he's out there. Oh yeah. He believes it. Yeah. He was like, no one could have made shocked. They definitely could have made that shot. It's a rifle. It's not that far. Just because someone gets lucky doesn't mean they can't get lucky. Like people get lucky all the time. People flip a coin and it lands on heads a mile away. I mean, you know, you could throw a coin, you could, you could throw a coin out of a helicopter, you know, you could say this is going to be heads when it lands and it can be heads.

Speaker 1:          02:06:31       You can get lucky. Right. It really is possible. Well this assassination of Franz Ferdinand that triggered the first world war. This. Yes. Okay. They, they messed up. I had like seven of them and they met in secret and they got their weapons that morning and so on. And a couple of them, chicken, dad, somebody else cut last. It's just like three of them there. Somebody threw a hand grenade, missed, rolled into the car behind the friends for non and and they got hurt and went to the hospital and he's like, oh fuck, there's not giving my speech, let's go to the hospital and visit, see how he's doing. So they double back like half an hour later they doubled back and come back down the same route. And the guy who had missed, he was just sitting there on the curb. It's like, Oh fuck, here they are. Bam. Yeah, pure luck. Pure luck. Yeah. Yeah. That doesn't happen. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that, that history turns more on that kind of thing. Then on carefully orchestrated, perfectly executed plot. Sure. It certainly can. But you know, the, the idea that, um, uh, I'm, I'm, I've always found it offensive. The idea that there's no way Oswald could have hit him. Like people say that like there's no way. There's no way you're out of your. You never

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       shot anything. That's crazy. I can make that shot. One hundred percent. Yep. I will. Look, if you have a rifle with a scope and a guy is a hundred yards away, you tell them you can't shoot him. Right? That's crazy time. That's crazy. Talk or the rifle was out of La. That was the other thing. They said the scope wasn't lined up correctly. Here's the thing, folks, if you have a rifle, okay, and this has happened to me before, and you drop the rifle, the scope gets damaged, it gets moved. It's a very sensitive thing, like when you're talking about something that goes faster than the speed of sound of bullets, boom, firing out of a rifle, you have that. That is going incredibly fast and to be able to get that radical exactly on where you think that bullet's going to hit requires a lot of adjustments. When you go to the range, they set up a lead sled.

Speaker 3:          02:08:23       You put your rifle down on this sled so you're not holding the rifle, and by the way, we oddball wasn't holding it either. The idea was that he had it rested, right? Which makes it much more steady and much more easier to make an accurate shot. So you set up this rifle on the lead sled and it's usually 100 yards or 200 yards, whatever, however farther distances to the target, you squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, boom. That trigger goes off and you see that the bullet is low and to the left by a couple of inches, you make an adjustment on the scope. If you drop that rifle, that scope gets knocked the adjustments out the window. So the idea that there's like a perfect chain of command between Lee Harvey Oswald, pulling that trigger and that scope never got rattled at all. No, but the conspiracy theorists want you to think there's no way he could've made that shot.

Speaker 3:          02:09:07       That scope wasn't even lined up. Good. How the fuck do you know? No. You don't know. Like anybody who knows anything about rifles, knows there's no way you could know, because if all you'd have to do is whack it here, I'm going to bring you the rifle and just bump it with your elbow funny. Knock it into a wall when you're handing it to someone and that scope's going to be off, right? So you then you take it to a range. We're going to prove definitively that he could have never made this shot because this scope is off. Look, it's six inches to the left. Wow. Case closed right now. There's no way people know whether or not that scope was on when he was pulling that trigger. There's no way. You know, when I went to Dealey Plaza, it's so big and our public imagination, it's not.

Speaker 3:          02:09:48       It's not like this is it. It's tiny and so small. And then you go up to the museum and you're on the sixth floor, positive, the book depository, and you look down and they have an x, the two xs in the street. And you think that's just right there. Dude, I can shoot that with an arrow. I bet you could. I can. Yeah. I guarantee if you give me some time, you give me some time if you put a target right where that thing was right where that a lincoln was and, and you put me in that window, I guarantee you I hit that target with a bow, right? Like the idea that you couldn't. And I'm holding it. No rest. The idea that you couldn't do that with a, with a rifle, right? You turn it certainly could. Lee Harvey Oswald certainly could have done it. He certainly couldn't have shot at Kennedy. He was a crazy fuck. Lee Harvey Oswald was involved in a lot of shady shit. It wasn't like he was just

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       some dentists somewhere toward the second reading depositary he scored the second highest marksmanship. There it is. Right? Right here to here. Right. Dude, that's so small. That was such a short distance. Then the other question I had when you're coming up Houston street and going left, I always wondered why he didn't shoot him there when the car's coming right at him. What was the other window? He was in the window on the left hand side. He was over there. No, no, no, no. It's over here. Yeah, it's right there. That's where he shot them from that window there. Yup. So I always wondered why he didn't shoot him when the car was coming right at him. Because that would have been a cleaner shot. It seems to me head on you mean? Yeah. Yeah, um, maybe you want to shoot him in the back of the head.

Speaker 1:          02:11:14       Does it have like a sniper? It's maybe panic. It's that upper right? Yeah, at that one. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. When we drove through it, when the last time, not last time was in Dallas a couple times ago, but when we drove through it, it's like, it's eerie. You're like, wow, this is. It all happened right here. I've been twice there and there's always a conspiracy people walking around there looking for a tip. I gave this guy 10 bucks and go, all right, give me the whole story. And Oh, he was very entertaining here. Here's the Grassy Knoll, the picket fence. And he had another one about this man. He took the manhole cover off because there was somebody down here in the manhole. Oh, lopped up. Bam. Shot him, went back down to the metal favorite DM conspiracy is they believe that the driver turnaround shot. That's the best way.

Speaker 1:          02:11:54       Yeah. Those are the spaces. Fake people. You're always going to get a bunch of really wacky conspiracies whenever anything happens in the news, whatever it is, you know, anything and everything, particularly if it's big and famous. Again, back to this cognitive dissonance like Princess Di, you know, cause of death, drunk driving, speeding. No seatbelt. You know, tens of thousands of people died that was drunk. He was drunk yet the driver of her car was drunk. I didn't know that. He was partially drunk. He was tipsy drunk. Wow. I didn't. I didn't know. Yeah, that's right. So drunk driving, speeding. And, and she wasn't wearing a seatbelt. Why wasn't she wearing a seatbelt? So, I mean, that's it, but it doesn't feel like print. Someone like Princess Di should die the way tens of thousands of Americans die in automobiles every year. It seems like there should be, you know, the [inaudible] and the royal family, uh, the Arabs and the Palestinians that everybody was involved.

Speaker 1:          02:12:48       Well, here's an example of an absolute conspiracy that we know is, was a conspiracy. Jamal Sogi. Yes. Right. Yeah. A good example. This kind of stuff does happen. This is a real case. That guy was murdered, he went to the Saudi embassy in Turkey. They had him set up, they flew in 15 people, including a guy who was a, he was a forensics expert and he was an expert in forensics, forensics evidence, and they think that he was there to make sure that there was nothing left behind. They, this is the official story is they strangled him, caught him up, and the, there's even recordings apparent that goes all the way to the listen to the top. Saudi Arabia. What does this, Jamie, that's the last video seeing him. Oh, the body double video of him walking in and then it's the last time you've seen. Yeah, he, he entered into there and there's 15 different dudes that were waiting for them.

Speaker 1:          02:13:46       They killed them, chopped him up. And there's videos of those guys leaving with suitcases and they say that the suitcases had his body in them chopped up. Yeah. It's um, it's real, but that's also, you know, Saudi Arabia, they can get away with some pretty sketchy shit and it seems like nothing's going to happen. Right? Like people, few people got fired. Well, I have to say on this that I'm Michael Moore's film on nine slash 11. He made the point, I was the first I'd seen make the point that the Saudi Arabia family got out of the United States on 9:12 when all flights were canceled and that Bush let you know. And now here we see that trump doesn't want to condemn the Saudis because they're our allies. So there's a bunch of shit in there. It goes all the way back to nine slash 11. And we know the Saudis support, uh, uh, bankrolled most of the 19 hijackers.

Speaker 1:          02:14:44       Yeah. So that's the kind of conspiracy that we should be paying attention to. Not that Bush was involved and made it happen in the secret. This is the kind of shit that really happens in politics, you know, people are our banking each other, so we have to be nice to each other and overlook it. You know, like when trump said, you know, Putin, Putin murders people, oh well everybody does it. What we do some terrible things to, and, and, and that's true. And it's true. And you know, I guess he's got a point, but the. Yeah, it's just so there's so much money, so much money involved with Saudi Arabia. In this article I was writing, I cited a criminologist, manual eisner in a study of 1500 monarchs in 45 monarchies across Europe. Between add 600 and 1800, found that about 15 percent of them 227 were assassinated chorus punting to homicide rate of about a thousand per 100,000 ruler years, 10 times the background rate.

Speaker 1:          02:15:45       So in other words, assassinations in history are pretty common. This is how power often changes hands before liberal democracies spread. And after 19 seventies, this was not uncommon though, so we shouldn't be surprised that people believe this kind of stuff because you know there's some truth to that thing is unsettling to folks because what he was killed for, they think, well there's. There's two different versions of it, right? There's this film. He was killed for criticizing the Saudi Arabian government, but he was also. There was also that he was criticized because he was aware or he was killed rather because he was aware of some spy software that's being utilized and that if he wrote a story about this spy software being utilized by the Saudi Arabian

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       government, that it would be a huge disaster. Mm hmm. Could be. Yeah. Yeah. I mean there's more. We, I'm sure there's a lot we don't know. So here's my, a concession to conspiracy theories. When you get elected president, they take you in the back room and they go, okay, here's what's actually going on. Right? Oh Shit. I can't close Gitmo close. Get bumped because no one will take those bed dudes. Okay, but, but pull the troops out of Afghanistan can't pull the troops out of Afghanistan if we do that. Here's what happens. Oh Shit. But we don't know this. We know this. And I think that something like that does go on, maybe not quite so secretly, but just that you know, you and I don't need to know. These things need to know basis. And, and the president does. When their candidates, they say, oh, whatever they say to get elected, and then they get in there and go, oh, okay, I didn't realize that the Saudis are doing this and this and this and we need them for these six reasons over here.

Speaker 2:          02:17:21       Okay. They did this bad thing and if we condemn them then they're not going to do these things over here, so I better lay off the condemnation. That kind of stuff I suspect does happen a lot. I think you're correct. I think I suspect the same thing. Now what's fascinating to me about trump is that he doesn't seem to care at all about violating protocol or about releasing information that he probably shouldn't be there. He's already accidentally released top secret information. I would just feel like if he knew for sure some, some stuff, like he would be the last guy you would want to trust with that. Right. I know, but you know this thing about him wanting to pull the troops out of Syria. There's gotta be another story behind. They're like, you know, Putin maybe. He said, look, we gotta take care of our business here in Syria.

Speaker 2:          02:18:10       We're going to take care of Americans over here and you get your trump tower in red square when, when I'm gone or whatever, you know, there's some kind of. That kind of stuff is the sort of thing that will come out in a equivalent of a Wiki leaks in 20 years will go, oh, like the Gulf of Tonkin. Oh, okay. That's what happened. What do you think conspiracy theory that says that trump has some video of trump getting peed on or people that was published in like some serious newspapers. Yup. Yup. There's so much of this stuff that I just can't keep track of it. I mean, don't you think with him though too? They'll, they'll like, read more than willing to put stuff like that out there because they don't like them. So they'll pull that trigger a little bit quicker maybe. Yep. But you know, during the Bush administration, people hated George W dot Bush and hated him as much as they hate trump.

Speaker 2:          02:18:59       Uh, no. I think now they're going, oh, we would love to have George W Bush back. I feel like they just thought he was incompetent. Although directly Putin does not deny possessing compromising material on trump. Uh, but, but what did he actually say? Yeah. I don't know. Yes, this is about the pee tape says Matthew Yglesias voc. What is it from Volvo? It's vox moving doesn't mean a. He probably didn't understand what they were saying. Speaks Russian, right? I Dunno. Um, do you find it odd that the, these conspiracies not only do, it seems like it's a part of our, our mind, the way our brains work, our collective mindset is that we tend to be attracted to conspiracies and we tend to hope that those or true more than we hope a simple explanation exists. Yeah. Well, it depends. It depends on who your group is and do they have power or not.

Speaker 2:          02:20:04       So we know from studies that people that are out of power tend to consume, can concoct conspiracy theories about the, those in power. And the moment they get empowered, they drop the conspiracy theories and the ones that are out. Uh, so you're going to get more conspiracy theories about Republicans when the Democrats are out of power from left leaning people and vice versa. It blacks are more likely to think that the CIA planted crack cocaine in the inner cities and, and, and those sorts of things. Conservatives are more likely to fear big government conspiracies. Liberals are more likely to fear big corporate conspiracies. It, there may be elements of truth in all of these things, but the ones your latch onto have to do with how much power you perceive the other guy has that you don't have and therefore they must be doing something to get that, that I can't do.

Speaker 2:          02:20:51       I'm on the outside and so we tend to misperceive how much control and power people really have in positions of power. Ceos, politicians and so on. Usually they don't have as much control and power as we think they do and people that get in there, they go, oh, I can't, I can't. I don't have this kind of controller power. I thought I would when I got here, but obviously I don't do too many things that have to do checks. And balances that are in place, so you can't do these things on your own. You really need a group of people to conspire along with you. So you mean to have these frank discussions with some sort of an understanding that you have to keep this a secret, right? Maura? Yeah. In other words, like 12 guys in London are going to control the world's economy.

Speaker 2:          02:21:36       How are they going to do that? I mean, who do you call to start a war and cause inflation or whatever. More likely. It's like in the Cuban missile crisis where you have jockeying back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Okay, look, we're going to give you the missiles in Turkey. If you take the missiles out of Cuba. And it just ends up being some boring little thing that dissolves the tension. That could have been world war three. It's like wow, just this little thing. And so much of history turns on those little, you know. So in a way we got lucky there, but not just luck. I mean, Kennedy and Khrushchev both wanted to untie the knot, you know, crew shift sent a memo to Kennedy saying you have pulled on this rope and I have pulled on this rope and I don't know if either of us can untie it, but here's an idea. That's when he floated the, you take the out of Turkey

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       and, and I was just watching this netflix documentary on this and there was a thing about Castro Santa memo to crew chef saying light them up, you know, comrade, we are ready to die for the cause. You can just nuke all of Cuba and nuke America. I don't care. We're ready to die. And Khrushchev Khrushchev apparently was like, holy fuck, this guy's a madman. We're not going to do that. And so that's true. He's ready to new Cuba. Yeah. Jesus, where's that memo? Uh, they, they talked about this in this duck. The netflix. Yeah. Anyway, so this was during the times of operation northwoods when they were gonna blow up a drone jetliner and blame it on the Cubans arm, Cuban friendlies to attack Montana Mo Bay. And use it as a motivation to get us into war. That Castro is a fascinating case because that guy kept that place 90 miles away from Miami.

Speaker 1:          02:23:20       He kept that place running on his own until he died. That was crazy. Really. It's crazy that he was able to pull that off. Well, he had a lot of support, economic support from Russia otherwise. And that would not have succeeded, but still it's so nuts that he was so close and he was running a military dictatorship. Essentially a boat ride away. Yeah. I was just in Moscow a few months ago for a conference since I went to visit their world war two museum, what we would call a world war two museum, just massive building it and they call it the Great Patriotic War Museum. And the whole thing is kind of attribute to Russia liberated Europe from the Nazis. Yup. This is current. Oh yeah, yeah. I mean this is from their perspective, they lost 27 million people. You Americans, you know, 500,000 nothing. Right. And from their perspective. And you go to Berlin right next to the victory museum.

Speaker 1:          02:24:19       Look at that. Yeah. It's called the victory museum. Well, there it is. The Museum of the Great Patriotic War is a history museum located in Muskoka yet. And they have this room with these chains hanging down with little crystal balls at the end of them that represent the 27 million people. And it's, it's, it's very moving. Go back to that. That right there is good. Look how beautiful that place. It's quite stunning. And each of those rooms that you go into, it's like a diagram of some battle that they fought. We, I think it's good for us to know this, to recognize from their perspective they, they, they won the war, not the British American and French. We did a little bit from their perspective, but the fact that they lost so many people, 27 million. What's going on with that picture? I don't remember. Fucked up looking at the present. That's a weird picture. Um, I mean they have a point in terms of their contribution in terms of the loss of lives. Yeah. That's A. I mean every country has its perspectives in that regard, which is why it's good to some history, so you know

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       what other people are thinking and what they went through. Well, it's again though, it's very similar to what we're talking about earlier in terms of the distribution of the news. It would be very nice if there was one absolute news source you can trust with no slant on it whatsoever. When it comes to the distribution of history, it's of course always written in a way that favors the people that are writing it. Yeah. I was just talking to Rachel Kleinfeld. I have a podcast now, a few months. That's six months now. It's science salon podcast. Yeah. Well it's sort of an extension of our old caltech lecture series, but instead of lectures we're not doing dialogue you called so people can see science salon, science salon. Yep. So just skeptic.com. It's okay. So I'm interviewing are dialoguing with Rachel Kleinfeld. She has a new book called a savage order and it's about failed states and what happens to them and why corruption spread so quickly.

Speaker 2:          02:26:22       And then how to basically squelch that. So like after the Soviet Union fell apart, you know, all these mobs basically took over and it's like the Russian mafia, the Republic of Georgia fell apart fairly quickly and then, you know, so one of the reasons people apparently like Putin is he kind of came in and, and, and squelched all that. And, and maybe one of his points of popularity is that at least we have one bad guy who's got kind of keeping an order instead of all these little mafioso type gangs. And uh, and I said, so if he actually held an election, he might win. It's like, it's hard to say because we don't have a good source of what the Russian people really like. We have the Russian media saying the Russian people love Putin. Okay. Do we know that's an accurate survey? Is Pretty astonishing. What kind of a control he has over the country though?

Speaker 2:          02:27:14       Yeah, it's powerful. I went to visit a lot. I saw Lenin's tomb and the Mazda Liam there, he's still still looking pretty waxy, uh, to me. Oh, that's right. You can actually see his body or what's the. His body. Yeah. Yeah. What's left of it yet another netflix series. I just binge watched Trotsky. It's called Trotsky and this is a Russian made film. It's a drama and um, it's really good and it really shows. It's interesting because he, Trotsky was on the outs all the way until just recently because Stalin had him sas donated and then on had him literally airbrushed out of photographs because for awhile it was Lenin and Stalin. Trotsky is the big three and then when Lenin had a stroke it was like, okay, so Stalin and Trotsky, who's going to take over when the boss is gone? And uh, so they kind of showed how that happened. And again, conspiracy. It's all conspiracy. No one knows what's really going on here. You've been in this business, this debunking conspiracy conspiracy's in the skeptic business for quite a long time. Do you feel like there is any improvement in the critical thinking skills of people and their ability

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       to recognize the fallacies and the flaws in the way they're approaching these things? Hard to say. Confirmation bias there, less of that now than before, like to think we're having an influence. There is some studies that show, you know, fewer people believe in these pseudo sciences and quackery and paranormal, but it's not. The declines are not that dramatic over say the last few decades. There are deprogramming bias, deprogramming studies and programs in which you can teach people about the confirmation bias in the hindsight bias and so on. The problem with those is they work really well to teach people how to spot the biases and other people. They're really good at that. But then you say, well, what about you? Oh know, fortunately I'm above all that. There's a blind spot that's called the blind spot bias. You can't see your own bias, but you can see it in other people.

Speaker 1:          02:29:14       Um, so the, um, the reason these studies are done is because we have a problem with climate change. We have climate deniers. How do we get people who don't know anything about it to shift from? I'm a skeptic too. I'm a believer and it shows, it turns out just piling on facts isn't going to do it. No people's identity are trapped in their initial initial statements. If they think that nine slash 11 was a conspiracy there, their identity is somehow inexorably connected to this conspiracy being a fact, and then you argue it as if you're arguing your own value. It's a really weird thing that happens when people start talking about ideas. If the you, you, you've very rarely find people that are disconnected from their ideas to the point where you could point out that something's incorrect and they go, oh, thank you. I didn't know that.

Speaker 1:          02:30:06       Like most people aren't really that confident now, or are they just look at it the wrong. It feels like a personal attack on them. Also as, uh, if it's a belief or claim or theory or whatever affiliated with a political or moral or religious value, the people autocorrect in their brains when they hear global warming, they hear liberalism, communism, capitalism, control of the market, big government. And I'm against those things so that global warming things got to be faults. That is one of the weirder aspects of tribal thinking, right? Pink or makes the point that, uh, Al Gore's film an inconvenient truth was a terrible thing for the environmental movement because at associated global climate change with liberalism, the Democrats and all that, it's like, oh, okay, I see what's going on. It's that Al Gore left liberal stuff. That's right. Yeah. Well in, in, in a sense he's right.

Speaker 1:          02:30:58       And then in another sense it was also the amount of profit that alcor made both from that and from some other endeavors that he has. They said that he's one of the first green billionaires. So God, Jesus, what's his carbon footprint is around a private jet everywhere. He's talking about the world. Yeah. It's like, it's screwy. Yeah. But that's, you know, there's, everything's messy. People are messy, right? So we're very tribal. We commit to political parties or religious beliefs and we stick by them pretty closely, a pretty tightly. And the facts get filtered through those. Understandably, um, you know, what to do about it, you know, that's, that's under debate it. Same thing with the atheist debating. How do we get people to leave religion? Well, just there's 100 ways you know, Leah Remini on her show on scientology. Anyone watching that would think, okay, I'm not joining this church, and so if you had a thousand of those for bad beliefs, hopefully we see that shift.

Speaker 1:          02:31:58       I would love it if there was some sort of a secular option of community driven, ethics driven, morality driven friendship driven thing where people could go and instead worship, maybe just appreciate life and sort of confirm some of the best aspects of, of community and culture and who we are and do it in a place where it makes you really conscious of it. So because I think there's, there's some, some real benefit to people going to church and everyone in the community community dresses up nice and you sort of agreeing, hey, we're committed to being civil and to being kind and to worshiping and that this belief in a higher power. If it it, it, it empowers people to think this way and it gives people a motivation to be kind. And it would be nice if there was a secular option like that. That is decentralized.

Speaker 1:          02:32:53       It's not run by one person who winds up banging everybody's wife and taken all the money because that's what happens. Always happens. You can set your clock by these guys. It's unbelievable. The humanist movement is something like that. What is this? I'm not aware of secular humanist or just humanists. There's groups all over the world have churches. Well, they have meeting places, I would call them churches, uh, more broadly. The kind of universalist unitarian church is a church and it's a religion, but they're pretty secular. They're like secular Jews, you know, they believe in the culture and the, and the ceremonies and the rituals. I've been to a number of these humanist and universalist unitarian churches ceremonies. They light candles. They sing hymns to Newton. Uh, they have testimonials about how I lost my religion. And to me, I didn't really like it that much because I was never crazy about church in the first place, but a lot of people clearly get value out of this atheists and humanists that don't believe in God. The gathering together once a week and being with fellow likeminded people that has a lot of psychological value. It connects people and that's one of the great things about community centers in neighborhoods, you know, it just connects people and like, hey, we're all in this together. All right, Bob, see you tomorrow. Bye Mary social capital. There's something, there's something great about that with Church that uh, I mean I was having this conversation with bill burr about this recently. We were talking

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       about it and he's like, I don't really want to go to church, but I think there's some, something to that to go into a place and putting your faith in all the people around you and the, the, the, the higher values and morals and ethics that you're all agreeing to, right? Yup. You know, it's back to the self help thing is sort of a reminder every week. Be a good person. Don't forget to donate to charity. Here's some local charities here. These are our causes. Be Good, be good, be nice to your spouse and your children is on. And so people kind of leave a little charged up for the week on Sunday, back to Monday. And that's probably the main draw of those big Tony Robbins things too. There's a community of us together. We're all trying to do better. We're all trying to better ourselves and optimize our lives.

Speaker 2:          02:35:02       That's right. There's nothing wrong with it. Same thing. Back to Jordan Peterson. That's the threat. He's, he's given a message. People like to hear that. Yeah. And okay. So what, why is that bad? It's not bad. Yeah. Now of course people like Richard Dawkins will point out, yeah, but, but can we decouple all the supernatural nonsense from the social community? Yes, we can. But don't you think that there's less, there's less of an acceptance of the supernatural nonsense than there was 50 years ago, 100 years ago. And it seems to be a trend. Those members are getting bad. Secularism. The number of the percentage of nones, people tick the box for no religious affiliation, uh, that used to be in the single digits. It's now 25 percent of all Americans. Thirty three percent of millennials. Those born after 1991. And it looks like probably with identities can be closer to 50 percent people born after 1995.

Speaker 2:          02:35:49       Now they're not necessarily atheists, agnostics, skeptics, but they don't affiliate with any religion. And that's good because in the sense that, uh, it's religious behavior that causes some of these social problems that we are encountering now with Islam. For example. Um, you know, so if somebody privately believes in God or whatever and they don't act on it, okay, I guess I don't care. And that's it. It's the acting on your beliefs that causes the problem. Well, when you enforce those beliefs on other people, that's right. So when it spills over into politics, education, science education, particular, well, that's one of the real problems they're having in Europe when they're dealing with people that are coming over from other countries where they have a different set of values and they're seeing women in skirts and they're calling them whores, bro. You're in England, right? Different set of rules over here in California.

Speaker 2:          02:36:39       You won't believe it. And they think that God has, you know, God has dictated these rules are in their eyes. They're seeing some horrible sin. They're seeing the decay of the moral fiber, the moral fiber of their environment. These are primitive beliefs having to do with men wanting to control women's reproductive rights. There's evolutionary reasons for this. You had Brett and heather on here. They get explained that beautifully, um, at. But we have to overcome that just because it's an evolved tendency for men to want to control women's reproduction a doesn't mean we should do that. The opposite. Yeah. And, uh, so I make the case, uh, one of my scientific American columns on abortion that, you know, if our mutual goal between pro lifers and protracer is, is to reduce the amount of abortions we, we know the formula, educate women, empower women versus control, birth control, access to birth control, and so on.

Speaker 2:          02:37:34       It just happens automatically. The pregnancy rates go down, therefore abortion rates are going to go down. We know how this, uh, do this, but still people that pro lifers, you know, to start a glom on to it, but it's a moral issue. Okay? Take the moral out of it. I understand it's a human life or potential human, the whatever you want to argue. I get on the. Take that out. Let's just work to the common goal of reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies. My favorite one that still exists is abstinence. The idea that they're trying to push this on these. Essentially when you. Especially we're talking about really young people that are just getting horny for the first time.

Speaker 3:          02:38:10       Yeah, I mean they're on drugs. Just say no, why are you talking about you take the average 17, 18 year old kids and you try to get them together and no one's in the room and they're aging raging with hormones and they're both supposed to keep their clothes on like, look, man, it's not going to happen. It's just not going to happen. You've got to let that go and this idea that you're going to tell them that God wants them to be abstinent like, are you sure? Why did he give us these goddamn hormones? What's happening here?

Speaker 2:          02:38:42       There studies on how effective abstinence only programs or chastity pledges and these sorts of things, how effective. Not only are they not effective, they're worse because then people go into like a date or something, unprepared band, the hormones kick in and they start going at it and then they don't have protection. Well, there's also the thing where

Speaker 3:          02:39:03       Catholic schools, like when I was a kid, we always knew and like this is what we're talking about in the eighties, everyone knew the girls who went to all girls, Catholic schools were freaks because they were never around boys because they're all in just this school with girls with they end there. Everything is suppression. Suppress, suppress, suppress. They just can't wait to get out there. They find a boy and they go crazy. Like everybody knew it. I mean, this is not something that I knew as a comedian or as a person who studies culture. This is something I knew as a 14 year old. Everyone knew that girls who went to all school, all girl Catholic schools were freaks, right? It's just as the opposite intended effect.

Speaker 2:          02:39:45       There was a study, a British study I found that found some small part. It was like one and a half percent or whatever of 10,000 women who said they got pregnant without having sex. Oh, that happened. It happened. How did that happen? It doesn't happen. So immaculate conception. That's right. It's hilarious. Yeah. Or they do everything but. Or they had anal or whatever and say, well, we didn't actually have sex, you know, like Clinton, you know. Well, what do you mean by sex? And have sexual as soon as he

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       will. I did not have sexual relations with that woman is landscape. Sex is intercourse, penis, Vagina. That's it. Everything else is just hanging out. Right? Well, it's the, the, the need for belief systems is. It's so. I mean, it, it helps people to have belief systems. If they're positive and they're objective and their well-reasoned in there, you know, these are backed by facts and knowledge. It helps, but the need for belief systems is so strong that will take a belief system that's wonky because. Because we, we have that desire.

Speaker 2:          02:40:54       Yup. Yeah. The brain abhors a vacuum of belief is the way I put it in and something's going to be in there. So let's try to put in those brains rational science based values, and we had those, I mean, humanist values that, you know, the humanist movement is now about a, sent almost a century old universal human rights. Uh, the, the Universal Human Rights Declaration just celebrated its 50th anniversary. You can get diverse. People do agree. Uh, you don't have to have the correct philosophical arguments to get there, but you know, just everybody should be treated equally under the law. Can we at least agree on that? Yes. Okay. Uh, I mean, if you start off with pinker makes this point lightened manal. If you start off with Jesus died for our sins, that's the most important value built value to me. You're not going to get agreement in a room full of, you know, UN diversity. You got to start with something super basic and general. Everybody's deserves equal rights. Okay? Yep. And then you start to build from there and we can do that.

Speaker 3:          02:41:53       Do you find you've been in this for a long time and you've done some really valuable work? It's been, it's, it's so nice that there's someone like you that really has dedicated their life to really illuminating truth, exposing all the flaws and people's thinking. Do you feel like the reception of this is you're, it's easier now or there's momentum behind this kind of thinking?

Speaker 2:          02:42:16       I do, yeah, for sure. It's more open Po, po part of my. I have a distorted view. I'm from California. I grew up in southern California. We're pretty liberal society here, so I'm empathetic to people that write me from Oklahoma or Arkansas and I'm in this little town. Everybody. The only question is which Christian church do you go to the Baptist or the presbytarian and you know, everyone in his family, everyone at work is a believer and he's an atheist. A. Okay. So I haven't faced anything like that, you know, and I'm a middle aged white guy, you know, I don't. I do have white privileges. I know. Uh, and so I, I am sympathetic to others, but I do think across the board things are more tolerant. You know, we know this from studies on interracial marriage, for example. That's not even an issue anymore. The gay rights thing has changed very rapidly. I mean, that was stunning. How quickly social attitudes changed after the.

Speaker 3:          02:43:09       Well, we have to remember in 2:13,

Speaker 2:          02:43:11       Hillary Clinton was still saying that she didn't believe in gay marriage. Is there any standout because it was a political position. That's right now Obama in 2011, although you never know when a politician says live of course. Uh, but now, uh, so I predict, you know, like the gay marriage thing, this no one will even be talking about it in another year or two. It'll change so quickly and so across the board, the acceptance now of atheist, humanist, secularists, agnostics, whatever is become much, much better in most places. They're still set, of course, Islamic countries where not only would they burn me and you, they'd burned Catholics because they picked the wrong religion. So there's still that. But I wonder if there's some improvement there in those countries because the Internet with younger people when they're being exposed to these new ideas, maybe a, I'm not sure on that data.

Speaker 2:          02:43:57       The last time I saw a big pole was on, uh, how supportive you would be of Sharia Law and these are pretty scary, like a third to a half of Muslims living in Muslim countries that they would support Sharia law. And if you look at Tria laws, as you know, it's, it's pretty scary for very anti democratic liberal attitudes about rights and women and things like that. So there, I think the prediction would be yes, a millennials and igeneration when they get into power than maybe not just political power, but like controlling talk shows, radio shows, tv shows, scripts, things like that. Most, I think most moral change happens in people's minds from inculcating it from culture pop culture of just how you talk about other people. I'm like, if Dawkins makes this point that you can tell pretty much down to the decade, uh, when a book was written by the way they talk about when like a novel talk about women or blacks or whatever going back, say a century, you can say, well that was 19 thirties the way they're talking about Jews.

Speaker 2:          02:44:58       And that's the kind of thing that shifts very slowly, you hardly notice it, but from people like you comedians, you tell certain jokes or you say certain things and it becomes more acceptable scripts for television shows and films and all of us kind of watch it and absorb it and just think, yeah, you know, we shouldn't be saying those kinds of things about women and Jews and blacks or whatever. Stopped doing that and that consciously you just kind of soak it in. So I think you still need laws. We have to sometimes change the law and just say, okay, it's now illegal to discriminate against Jews or whatever. You can't do that now. People may still want to do that. How do we change their thinking? Well, if that's the bottom of thing that takes the course of decades or maybe a century and it takes generations sometimes because the new young kids have to see the flaws in the way their parents are thinking and, and, and have access to this information and form their own opinions on these things.

Speaker 2:          02:45:50       Hopefully bakes based on objective reasoning and reality and and all the awesome stuff that's available now. My stepdad was in the Pacific war and the way he talked about Japanese, you know, when I was a kid and the 60th and then by the time I became an adult, I'm like, Dad, you don't, don't say the stuff. Don't say it out loud. And think about 1947 to 1960. That's a tiny period of time. Right? It's so sure. Yeah. I mean that's really like, you know, when we're talking about the early two thousands, right? Imagine if World War Two happened during the early two thousands. Yeah. Yeah. It's hard. It's hard to remember. It's hard to put it into perspective. I think pop culture, the media, social media and so on is, is going to accelerate moral progress. It'll happen faster. Like it happened faster for women than it did for blacks.

Speaker 2:          02:46:39       It happened faster for gays and it did for women, you know, maybe whatever's next animal rights or something like this will accelerate even more. Maybe trans rights or something about the push back against this idea that we are living in the safest time ever and that there is an absolute trend, like pinker gets criticized about this where people say, no, the world is still not safe for these people, for this, for this group, for that group, and for you saying that the world is, it just shows your white privilege, white male perspective and I'm on board with, with Steve All across the board on these things. He's got the data. It depends on the question you're asking. You know, it's like if you say, yeah, but my life is not better. Okay, we're not talking about your life. The question is, is society getting better?

Speaker 2:          02:47:22       Okay. Of course there's ups and downs and this group is doing better than that group and yes, there's still some racial discrimination and yes, there's still clearly antisemites as we've seen recently, but across the board, if you take like the last 200 years, which direction are the trend lines going? They're all going in the right direction. So again, its scale. The question is what's the scale we're talking about? So it's, it's a little unfair to pinker to say, well, you're blind to that thing over. He's not talking about that one thing there. He's talking about just across the board. Yeah, I agree. Listen man, thanks for everything. Thanks for everything you do. Thanks for all your articles saying that books and thanks for coming on here. And please let people know. Your podcast once again is called skeptics, Alon Science, science, science along. He just got a skeptic dicom and it's posted there and yeah, so skeptic is still going and social media at Michael. Shermer is my twitter feed. You have instagram as well? I don't do that. How dare you? That's Michael Shermer one. Oh, do you have an idea? I'm going to start posting as of today. Okay. I will.
