Speaker 1:          00:00:00       [inaudible], we're back world, I used to say America, but foreign people get upset for bastards living in other countries. Sad enough. It can't be grace on our patch of dirt. Uh, I just had to explained to Cameron Hanes that when your iphone, when you use a bunch of Apps, you double click on that bottom button and then you, it shows you all the apps that are running in the background. Most people don't know this. Most people just use their phone. Right? But that's a fucking resource, Robert, right there, buddy. You gotta. Be careful. I learned something today. I got to have to show people things. Now when I'm showing you tech tips, you know, you know your tech retarded. I'm a little bit behind the curve. So what's happening brother? How you feeling, man? You just ran 100 miles a week ago. Yeah, I did. It was, it was about a week ago, right?

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       It was, yeah, it was last Saturday and Sunday. So father's Day. All in preparation for a 200 mile run in August. That's right. God Damn Dude. Yeah. We're talking about today, like the mental games that your brain starts playing on you. Yeah. And you were describing all the shit that your brain starts doing to you while you're running. Yeah. I always. There's so many peaks and valleys when you push yourself like that and it's uh, you know, I was thinking about all the ways I could quit, how I could come up with an excuse to get out of this race and really I could come, I could say anything because who's gonna who's gonna ever questioned it because it's like, okay, how many people have ever run for 24 straight hours. Right? So you can, you can't really question me, but it's just I pushed myself. So I mean I couldn't live with myself if I quit the race, but I'm not saying I wasn't thinking about how nice it would have been stopped running.

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       Well, anytime you're working out, I mean if you just think about a yoga class, which is only 90 minutes. Yeah, those last 20 minutes you totally thinking about, it'd be so nice to just get the fuck out of this hot room. Drinks cold water. But you just power through now. Multiply that times 24. Yeah. And way harder. Yeah, because you're running, you're exhausted, you're in pain. I can't even imagine I'm saying all these things and I'm just guessing. It's like, well, it's, you know, I, I teamed up with a pretty good runner, Jo Johann to start the race. He was getting a workout in. Um, he was pacing at the western states 100, which was this last weekend. And um, so he, he wanted to get a good workout, so I was like, oh cool, I can knock off a bunch of miles with him. So we were running pretty fast pretty fast for, you know, when you have to run for 24 straight hours. But we knocked off 10 miles quickly. I remember I was running with him, as you know, after you run 10 miles, you know, you've done something and I'm thinking to myself, I got 19 more miles. I felt like I had already got a pretty good workout and I hadn't even got started. Really felt like you were done and you had 90 miles left. Yeah. So it's uh, it's, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       you talk about mental strength and just keeping, keep hammering. Yeah, exactly. He just had to keep hammering daunting [inaudible]. And what is it like when it's over? What is the feeling like when you cross, when it's 24 hours at times up, you look at your, your distance, 102 miles. What does that feel like? It feels good most days, and this is just me, I can't expect anybody to be able to relate to my screwed up mine, but I mean me personally, I can go run 15 miles, get a good workout, go home and an hour later I'm thinking I could have done more. I'm not satisfied. So the big thing for me is when I've done something like that for the one of the few times throughout the year, I feel satisfied that I gave what I had. Wow. So it's just so brutal that you never feel like you could have done more.

Speaker 2:          00:03:59       No, no, no, no. I always think I could have been more. No, I'm disappointed with myself. Uh, um, just because in that race, and I can, I can try to have it make sense. Um, I can be logical about it and I could say, well I went out really fast because I want it to be as miserable as possible for as long as possible to prepare myself for the big foot 200. So I can say, well I ran super hard for, for hours hoping I was going to be miserable for 20 and I knew my pace that would, would have been a, would be slower and it'd be more painful but in the big picture to help me. Um, but that's just words to me. I'm thinking I had a, I was in first place through 50 miles. I was, you know, did 50 miles and in eight hours.

Speaker 2:          00:04:43       And so I was on pace for a lot of miles, a second place at a 62 miles and I was at 12 hours. I had run, I think 65 miles. So I'm on pace for 130, so I really died. And Yeah, you, I can, I can use words and say, well, is it, it was a plan, it was, it was part of being miserable and preparing myself for a greater challenge, but I also feel like, you know, I gave up, I'm miles and I could gotten my most miles ever and I should have got 120 plus miles. And so yeah, there's always the feeling I could have done more even even though. But I'm a little bit satisfied now. We're at the end of it. So you're, you're, you're killing it at 50 miles. You're in first place. And then is it just simply a matter of you just muscle fatigue and pain and you're just saying for me can only push so far? Yeah, I can't speak for anybody else probably for some people it's fatigue. Some people it's a just mental exhaustion. Um, for me it's pain, it's just I've run and I did my first marathon in 2002, so I've been doing this for whatever, 14 years. Um, multiple marathons every year back to back. Sometimes my body is not 100 percent, so I can push, I have a high pain tolerance, but eventually, um, it adds up and so it's pain for me.

Speaker 3:          00:06:17       Is this a joint pain, knees, everything. Is it just the whole body? It's waste down, hips, knees, ankles, feet. And how long does it take you to recover? Like you were telling me that your legs are swollen. Twice the size of normal.

Speaker 2:          00:06:32       Yeah. Last year. Last year was way worse. This year I had, I've put in a bunch of miles leading up. I was running about a half a marathon a day, so my body was, is pretty fit and pretty used to it. So my recovery was much shorter. I mean I, and again, people aren't going to understand this, but the next day after I ran 102 I ran 13 miles and that was just because when I run the big foot 200, I'm going to have to be able to come back after, you know, multiple days of being hurt and banged up. And that's the name of the game, you know, to cover 200 miles in a couple days, like I want to, I'm not going to be a hundred percent. So I thought well I can't, I can't know what it feels like to run after I run 100 miles and less one. I run a hundred miles and two, I run the day after.

Speaker 2:          00:07:28       So you can't simulate that. There's no way to simulate that. So you ran 13 miles a day after you run 100, two miles. And what the fuck is that like a, it'd be using the term loosely. It was painful. Slow. I was hiking the uphills running would be like, it would, I probably looked like a 90 year old man trying to run it. Fricken hurt. And what are you legs? Totally swollen. What you doing this? Yeah. [inaudible]. Yeah. My uh, my ankles are swollen and calves that don't really have an ankle. It's the same size for my foot up. And I mean it's not good for me. I mean it's not in anybody who talks about doing hundreds. Hundreds aren't good for anybody. So it's, it's. Yeah. I know that what I do isn't in the best interest of my body, but it's just the name of the game is what I do,

Speaker 3:          00:08:24       so what you do is not in the best interest of your body. You understand this, you're very aware of this and you're a professional bowhunter essentially, but you have this thing in your head where you have to push yourself as far and as hard as possible to find out for yourself to set goals, to try to push past this pain and endurance barrier that you have. Is that what it all is? I'm just trying to make sense of it because it's not like you're getting paid to do these. No, these are amateur race now. Not Getting at all. This

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       is just for me. I used to think I was an idiot for competing in martial arts matches for no money. Yeah. You know, but this is. This is crazy. Like you're. You're doing this at 48 years old with a family with a job. Yeah. And you're still. Yeah. It's just, it's just, it's just what I feel like I need to do and I don't. I don't, you know, don't know how long you're going to continue to do this. No, but uh, you know, that people have told me when I started doing marathons and running the mountain back home, like I said, I don't know, years ago, 15 years ago, and people said then, well, if you keep running like this by the time you're 40, you won't be able to run. And so here I am. They always say that. Yeah, I know. So I just, the point to point to that is I don't really care.

Speaker 1:          00:09:47       I don't do it for anybody. I don't do what I do for anybody else. Just for me. I feel like I need to do this. I like pushing my limits. That's why, you know, if I would have listened to people telling me what I shouldn't do or couldn't do or nobody could do, I wouldn't have done hardly anything in my life. So the point is I don't care. I don't care what anybody says, I don't care what anybody thinks. I just, this is what I do. I need to do it. I like finding my absolute limit and seeing how much I can withstand and this is us offices. Yeah, that's a weird thing that people always do. They have you do that. It's going to kill you if you have debt. It's going to break it down. What are you doing? Lifting weights. You know, I've heard the people that lift weights actually live shorter lives, right?

Speaker 1:          00:10:31       There's always this, these people that want to tell you to not do that. You know, like I'm always like, why are you doing it? But I'm never going to tell you don't do it. I just don't understand that there's, there's something to that mentality that we're kind of talking about this earlier today. I think there's something in some people when they see someone doing something crazy that they can't do and they want to figure out there's got to be something wrong with you and they've got to figure out a way to criticize you instead of saying, wow, that guy's fucking crazy. Or Wow, that's a crazy commitment. I, I don't want to do it, but I respect, appreciate it. Instead of doing that, they try to like poke holes that may or may not even be there. They try to. You're kind of admitting that it's not good for you, not kind of your 100 percent admitting for you.

Speaker 1:          00:11:17       It's not, but it is good for you in one way you're like your mind desires this extreme challenge and that keeps you very calm and sane. See as your. You're the kind of guy where I feel like if that didn't exist you would have like real problems, like just integrating and relating to regular society probably. I mean that's, I dunno, I dunno what I would be like without the challenge that I take on if I, but part of me feels like if I didn't do it, I would be a shell of myself as far as

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       I wouldn't be living up to my ability. My whole thing is like if I'm able to do it, I need to attempt it. I need to try. I need to do it. I mean because I just think that people need to live up to their full potential. That's what I'm doing.

Speaker 3:          00:12:07       Is there anything else though that you think is interesting like in that way, like this is, it's a competitive thing in some ways, like because you were saying, you know, hey, I'm first place at 50 miles, but at some, somewhere along the line it becomes more, you're pushing yourself and it becomes less of you in. You're not really engaging with someone else, even if you're racing them, you really kind of all in your own mind. Right? Is that.

Speaker 2:          00:12:31       Yeah, it's uh, yeah, look, I look at it more of just a competition with myself than with another race or, or, or another person. Of course if I'm running it would be cool to be first, you know, I mean that's just, I'm a competitive person. There's no doubt. But what I do, my workouts are always by myself. I'm, nobody's pushing me. It's just me and setting the goals, like to run big foot $200 or whatever. That's just me, you know, I don't know if anybody, I might not even see anybody during that whole race. So it was just like, you know, I think there's 75 or so people signed up, but it's going to be probably pretty spread out pretty quickly just depending on how fast people go out or do whatever over 200 miles point to point. So I could go, you know, to complete days and not see anybody. So yeah, it's, it's not, it's not really, it's not like the Olympic 100 meter dash where you're lined up against, you know, eight other guys and you see exactly where everybody is at. It's, this is more about a test of a personal will. So,

Speaker 3:          00:13:40       you know, we were talking today also, we're a guy that we know who's a kind of an expert and a lot of physical things are saying, well why don't you, uh, take epo, all these people that you're racing against, you'd probably take an epo. It's not like they're going to test you, but you're like, well, [inaudible] probably not going to help me with pain.

Speaker 2:          00:13:57       No, I don't really know what EPA does, but all I know is what, what limits me is just that pain. So unless something can like make me mentally stronger, I don't know if it's gonna help and uh, and a race like that because it's not like you're going super fast, you know, it's not like the pace is extraordinary. It's just grinding.

Speaker 3:          00:14:19       Those ultra marathon guys are seeking help with edible marijuana. That's a big one lately. And apparently it's a big with a lot of these ultra marathon guys were just reduces inflammation in some way that they find very beneficial as opposed to nonsteroidal anti inflammatories, which we'll probably get into to. It was talking about that because the Rhonda Patrick thing, but these ultra marathon guys, you know, now that it's becoming more and more acceptable to use cannabis as people are coming out and talking about it's, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       it's uh, it's interesting that it benefits them in that way because a Jujitsu people have been saying it for years that, uh, people always associate marijuana with you being lazy. But with a lot of Jujitsu guys, they find that it makes them more creative and more tuned into what they're doing. And also able to. Jujitsu can be pretty painful too. But although it's a different kind of pain, it's pain in, in short, short exchanges or painful that you don't want to tap and you fight your way out of a choke or something like that. But the grinding monotonous pain of what you're doing is kind of a different kind of pain. If I talk about what it would be like, I'm just talking out of my ass. Yeah. Well here's what I. here's what I will say. If somebody would offer me some edible cannabis at mile 80 last weekend you had taken it, I would.

Speaker 1:          00:15:45       I would have done almost anything to make the pain stop. But I have a regular job. I get surprised. Drug tests at work so often they surprised drug does to a god. I don't even, I don't know. Probably. I don't know. Once a year. And what are they testing for? I don't know. Just they just want your pee pee man. Yeah. I don't know what they do, but I mean I'm not. You know, there's something fucked up about that because it's one thing if you were doing a terrible job like yeah, like say if you were like a a guy who handles heavy machinery, you keep cutting off people's fingers like, Hey, maybe we should test camp a fuck. Is he up to camps high as fuck? It's not that. It's just they just decided like even if your job, if you're doing your job well, they still feel like they can test your body and find out what you're doing and it's also one of the real problems is it's rooted in ignorance because if you're, if you have this stuff in your system, like say if you smoke pot on a Friday, you get off work, have a joint, go play baseball with your son, have a good time.

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       It's not like you're high on Monday when you show up for it, but it'll still be in your system. Yeah. So they're, they're making sure you're not doing anything that they don't like when you're not there. I don't know that part of it. I don't really care personally because I live a clean life. I mean, I don't drink, don't smoke, don't do whatever. I mean, so they can test whatever, but I think part of it is uh, um, it's, it's one of the best places to work in the area. So they figured that, you know, part of the stipulation of working here is you're subjected to these drug tests. If you don't like it, you don't have to work here. Right. So, oh, I get it. I mean it's, I get, and I'm not saying that they're probably not testing for pot and thinking or I'm sure they are testing for pot, but I mean it's, you know, I think they test for alcohol. I think metric test for alcohol, I think they do. You have to be drunk there. Well, you'd have to be drunk out of a job. You don't have to have a drink at lunch and then they keep up

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       to do that. That's, I'm not saying people do that, but they could. But you could get hammered on Friday and Monday be clean as a whistle. Right? Yeah. That when they always do it is they'll call like it. You know, I start work at seven, so it'd be like 7:15 he needed, he needed to be to wherever and 15 minutes. So I think it's just they don't want somebody out hammered drunk at three in the morning. I'd probably still show up there at 7:30. Right, totally makes sense. Yeah, that totally makes sense because yeah, you are compromised and even if you show up and you're stoned at work for a lot of people that are compromised, I understand the idea that you would want someone to not have a drug problem. Right? Because we all know people that have had problems for me, like the most disturbing one has been people that I know that a big pill problems like speed and things along those lines because a lot of the times they're functional but just a little off.

Speaker 3:          00:18:45       And if you're dealing with important stuff, right, you could be making critical decision errors and because you're impaired. Yeah. So they might have hired you based on your critical thinking and your reasoning, but then that's all being compromised by a drug and there's only one way to find out what the fuck is going on with you testing. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. The problem with the cannabis things to twofold. One, it stays in your system. Your you can test for it for weeks and weeks after it's psychoactive because it's fat soluble and two, because this assumption that if you use something you abuse something is not, it's not accurate and it's only applies to losers. So like if you say, well look at all these losers, they get high every day. Well yeah. Okay. But there are also losers. Yeah, there's a lot of responsible people.

Speaker 3:          00:19:35       But when I say losers, I don't mean if you get high every day, you're a loser. I know people that get high every day and they're super successful. Businessman it guys. I know a lot of people, I know people that micro dose Lsd all the time and they run multimillion dollar businesses and they do it all the time. Yeah. But their personality is such that recreationally, they don't have an issue, they can do things and doesn't overwhelm their life, but some people can't gamble. You know what I mean? Some people, like if you play poker with some people, they'll lose their fucking mind. Next thing you know, they're on a flight to vegas. They're going crazy and they lost their mortgage is a disease. It's a legitimate mental disease, but not in the sense that you catch it. You know, Oh man, I didn't wash my hands.

Speaker 3:          00:20:18       I caught Vegas. You know, it's not like that. But it's a legitimate disease in the sense that it can fuck with your mind in a way that is almost out of your control. Like a cold makes your physical health out of your control. Like when I have a cold, I get upset at myself because I'm like, you fucking dummy. You let yourself get rundown or I know you didn't get enough sleep. You didn't, you know, whatever it is. You traveled too much and here you are. Now you feel like, shit, this is stupid. Yeah, well that's the sort of the same thing that happens people when they get a

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       gambling addiction, so it's not a substance thing. It's not like saying, hey, you know, cam, we're going to test you for gambling. Did you, uh, when you play poker with your buddies over the weekend, how much did you gamble? Oh, 10 bucks. Too much. You know, you can't, you can't do that to people. You can't. I think there's a, there's a real problem with that and you know, I mean, I guess you could say if you, if it's your, you're the employer and you know, this is the kind of people that you want. It's up to you. I don't, I don't fucking buy that. Yeah, I don't buy that. I say if the guy's doing a good job, there should be no issues. Right? Well, I think, uh, and I think there are a fair employer. So I think even if you did test for something, um, and you were that good employee, they're gonna, you know, they're going to work through whatever issues you're going to make.

Speaker 1:          00:21:35       You go to Rehab, but a bunch of losers maybe in sit around talking about pot. You imagine what it's like going to a rehab. If you smoke a little weed and you get popped at work and you got to go to a rehab with a bunch of stone cold junkies, they're all covered in scabs, clonic, fake spiders all day and or ultra marathon runners were talking about that. Test me after the big foot. 200 places. I'm going to get you so mad. I'm going to get you a ton of it. I take a couple months off work after that. I'm going to um, there was a pre workout supplement that we were talking about on the way up here to where they pulled it off the shelf because they found fucking meth in it. Straight up meth. It's like a meth, like substance that had never been tested on human beings and pull this shit off the shelves.

Speaker 1:          00:22:22       I asked Joe what it was called [inaudible]. You know that stuff would work right? That stuff. People get super addicted to that though, you know, it just didn't like coffee, like I'm probably addicted to coffee. I fucking love coffee. I love coffee. Tea or coffee? Coffee is. Is. This is caveman coffee. This is some delicious roast. What kind is this? Do you remember what roasted it is? There? Was that saber tooth, was it. Is it the same thing? It was the end of one, I think it was at. Yeah. Yeah. God Damn, that's it. That delicious stuff with the silver writing. Woo. That's good stuff. Yeah, it's really good coffee as far as uh, right now I'm just trying to keep my body is pure as possible. I'm not even doing pre workout at all because I'm so cognizant of what my heart's doing is. I'm pushing it so hard every day and I'm always got my heart rate monitor on.

Speaker 1:          00:23:10       Even during that, the ultra that I just did the 24 hour we were running fast and never got above 141 or 42 beats per minute. So I mean that when I take pre workout, obviously it's going to ramp up my heart rate and I just, so my work definitely doesn't have to worry about anything in me right now. I'm just trying to stay calm, stay a um, like an efficient machine out there and I'm feeling feeling good actually. That's awesome. Can you imagine if you took a pre workout and you got pot from meth to work and be like, hey cam, what the fuck you doing? Eating healthy, working out, taking super jacked formula number six. Oh, let's test that meth head. We have a real issue with that in the UFC. There a real issue with guys taking these supplements. Chad Mendez is a, one of the latest ones take these supplements that you buy from stores and these supplements turned out to have either steroids or hormone precursors or different peptides that make your body develop more testosterone or more growth hormone or different things that are banned by the U. S, Ada and a super common man.

Speaker 1:          00:24:19       Super Common. And you know, a lot of people like, you know, people online would love project. Yeah, that's what it was. It was a tainted supplement, but they're actually testing these supplements. When these guys get caught. Like A, for instance, tim means he's a perfect example. Like he was only suspended for a very short amount of time. They give him six months retroactive to the day where he got caught. He was supposed to have this fucking amazing fight with cowboy serone. That would have been an incredible fight. Yeah. To me it was super, super skillful. So they take a, Tim means, uh, he, he tells them what the supplement was. They go to a store independently, take it off the shelf, test it, and they go, she up. Sure enough it has a steroid in it. So there's a lot of this stuff that people are buying that they think is safe and easy.

Speaker 1:          00:25:01       If it works like that, you know, if it's like I put on 10 pounds and three hours, there's some shit in there. Dude, it's the stuff that works, works a little bit where it's like a little bit, you get like a little bit of an advantage, like everything is everything that's healthy and then legal that you could use like creatine, creatine works became like a little bit, a little bit of a bump and you can add a little bit of this, a little bit of that and this stuff helps that netapp helped ain't take this before you go to bed, it'll help your, your growth hormone increase and that stuff is like little incremental little edges. It works, it all works but a little bit. Yeah, I did that with complete nutrition. I think it was like 2011. They had some of that stuff and as you know, did a, taking a few different things and uh, it worked, it totally worked.

Speaker 1:          00:25:50       I definitely put on muscle and I was like Dang, this stuff is awesome. So it got done, went back in there like, oh remember that stuff that is something Nova or something like that. They're like, yeah, they pulled that, that's too strong. And I'm like, oh, so that's it. I mean, it definitely worked. The problem was a problem with that is, you know, like a young guys especially, they'll take whatever, but that stuff is hard on your liver, you know what I mean? Those supplements, I'm going through your liver like that. So it's uh, it's also hard on your balls probably. I took this stuff called Mag 10 bag 10 is the most powerful thing that I ever took. They pulled that off the shelf. Oh yeah. You used to take 10 clear pills a day. You just looked like a total pill head. I mean, it's like a stack of these pills and they're clear and they probably like super toxic on your liver from God. Damn. Did I get dragged to. Did it work?

Speaker 3:          00:26:45       Oh my God. Yeah. But it's, you know, you're manipulating your hormones. Yeah. And it's tricky doing that is tricky because you have to really be concerned with taxing your endocrine system. Your endocrine system shuts down because it's like, well, this, why does this guy have, you know, all this God damn extra testosterone. A system. I guess we don't have to make testosterone anymore, so balls crash. So your balls take a break and when you balls go on vacation then it takes like a couple of weeks for them to get back up to speed after you're up, you're done. Because if you're on that stuff, like say if you're on for like six weeks, I think they say it takes like at least three for your body to get back to normal. We bought it to let go. Whew. Okay. Really looks like a, you know, it's like your balls are like a haunted house.

Speaker 3:          00:27:27       Like everybody goes in and shines a flashlight around. We. Okay, we'll go back to business now. What the fuck was going on in here? Is this guy taking, you know, your body's not used to you taking something. It's processed through your digestive system and it's testosterone and all of a sudden you're like, what is this? Where's it coming from? Why is it coming from the liver? Right? What is this shit getting absorbed by your stomach and your intestines? This crazy testosterone stuff. You know, it's better just eat elk. That helps. That does help. Yeah. There's a bunch of different foods that are apparently, um, that, uh, that are high in or that make your body produce more testosterone. Here's an interesting thing that a lot of people are finding when they're going on ketogenic diets, and this is several people including me, that I have done this where once you start going on these ketogenic diets and you get your testosterone tested, and this is people that are on testosterone replacement and people that are not on testosterone replacement.

Speaker 3:          00:28:28       I've had three different friends who have similar results where your test just gets Jack. So what turns out that fats are one of the most important things like healthy fats and essential fatty acids and, um, and even saturated fats and cholesterol is one of the most important things for your body to convert to testosterone, for your body, to produce testosterone. It needs those precursors and needs those, those important important aspects of nutrition. Which is really interesting because for so long people thought that low fat diets were healthy and low fat was the way to go. Low Fat will make you have more energy. You'll be healthier. But it turns out that's not necessarily true and it's weird because like what was like doctrine 20 years ago or 10 years ago, right now, like a wound that's not the case. You know, I was reading my kid a book Dr Seuss Book and it was a nutrition pyramid at the bottom of the pyramid. Like the most important shit was bread and it was like bread and grains like that is not. No, no, no. Where's the vegetables? Right. Why is that fucking. Why is the bottom useless? Calories like pasta. That's so stupid. Yeah. And that's exactly.

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       People just pound that stuff in the evenings and wonder why they can't lose weight. Yeah. You know, that's the biggest thing is those late night carbs aren't getting burned up. Well, it gets converted to sugar and it also, there's the insulin, that's the real issue is a giant issue with your body getting this insulin spike and it's just not good for you. It's just not good to have that much God damn sugar. It doesn't exist in nature in that form. So we have developed these very weird bodies, you know, and ever since I've been on this high fat, low sugar kick, I've always, always aware that people are overweight. So it's natural. You see it everywhere, no big deal. But it's stunning when you really start taking an actual, like an inventory started looking around at all these people I know, belly fat and fat, neck, fat, arm, fat and we're capable of so much.

Speaker 1:          00:30:38       And then you see people who, you know, and I understand people are going through things or challenges that have different challenges in their life. I get it, but our bodies are so amazing. They don't have to let them get to that stage for sure. It's uh, it's unfortunate because it's so hard to change once you're at that stage, it's so hard and you feel terrible. You feel. And again, this is me talking about marathon runners and talking shit. I've never gotten enormously obese, but I would imagine I've gotten fat enough for. I'm disgusted with myself. Yeah. And that's like, you know, 10 pounds overweight. Right? But I think it just, it's, they feel like it's too much work. It's almost like the idea of running an ultra marathon, so. Right, losing 100 pounds. So much work. It's no different. So when you run an ultra marathon, you don't think about you're running 100 miles, you break it down.

Speaker 1:          00:31:28       I mean, and so that's the same thing with losing weight. You can't think about, hey, I need to lose 100 pounds. They think about winning that day right now. What are you going to do today? And then you can worry about tomorrow, tomorrow. But somebody asked me like, how do you stay in that a cryogenic chamber for three minutes at 250 degrees below zero. I said, I just count the 63 times. Yeah. And they're like, that's it. I go, yeah, that's all I do. I can't go one, two, three, and I get to 60 and I go, we're done with one one. And then I do it again. And then by the time I get to the third minute of just I'm shivering, but I'm just counting to 60. It's not that hard if you play a little game, right? Well it's no different. So if you wanted to try to do 25 reps in the gym, you don't do 25, you five sets of five.

Speaker 1:          00:32:13       Exactly. So you just break that down. Everybody has every, you know, people are different. People break things down differently. Um, you know, I've been thinking about this big foot $200 raise and I'm thinking well maybe I should break it into 50 mile races, you know, just break it down for fifties, try to get it done. So it's a logical gates, whatever. I do that when I do the Hindu squats, I do 210 do squats and the way I do it as I do them by tens, I just just do it and I have a clicker so I can't cheat because you will fucking forget while you're in the middle of that, you're like, what am I, I'm 30 and my authority or have to look at the clicker. So I count. And then at the end I checked the clicker to make sure I'm right.

Speaker 1:          00:32:51       There you go. But I break it down in tens. I just do 10 and then I do 10 more. Twenty and then, uh, do it like that. I think of it as each one being, uh, a 10 squat increment. So then I'm going to get through. It doesn't seem so daunting that I do 10 squats and I have 90 or 192 go. I think of it as just each little 10, 10 squat little event that I'm going to do. Here's another 10 squad. Yvette, here's not intense. Quite event, but that's nothing. That's not paying well compared to what you're doing. Yeah. Are also taking a fucking rock and throw it into a backpack. Running up the hill. That's ridiculous to not not running, but yeah. No, it's because you're doing that now though, you know, a lot of guys are not with your rock the way you do it, but many guys are taking sandbags and packing them down just like they would like if they were trying to.

Speaker 1:          00:33:46       If you had a heavy backpack and you have, you know, seven miles to go to get back to the truck, there's nothing you can do, but walk those God damn seven miles, that heavy backpack, it's not going to get out on his own. No, no, and that's, that's the thing is like, that's just hard manual labor, that's all there is to it. I mean when you start hunting elk in the back country or even deer in the back country or whatever your bear, you got to get that thing back to the truck. And so some, there's some guys who can just boost it, who don't train, who can just say, well, I'll take some time and I'll get it out. There's a few guys who can, who can do that and just one step at a time type thing. Most guys have to train to be in that position.

Speaker 1:          00:34:25       You know? Most guys. Yeah, without a doubt. It's, it's, it's very physically taxing. You went to, you and I were in Colorado and we packed out that bowl. Did, what? Did we walk like maybe six tenths of a mile? Yeah. Yeah. Mad most three quarters of a mile, quarter mile at most records a mile and you know, we only had like 100 pounds on and imagine like, I think remy was the one who was talking about it. Remy Warren of the fabulous a show. Apex Predator. He was on the podcast talking about how he had a pack or Moose out, I think it was a moose seven miles. Yeah. And at the end he was just broken for like months because his body was just dead. All I know it's it, you know, when I killed that Moose up in Alaska with Roy, you know, our last time together a moose and that was up over a big ridge into another canyon. It was four miles. It wasn't seven like roomies, but, um, it, it was 600 pounds of meat. So how are you going to get 600 pounds of meat? I mean, it's going to be 100 pounds at a time and up over the hill and Jesus Christ, it's a grind. But, uh, you know, through snow down we walked,

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       really thought it'd be. It was a better route just to go down the creek, like walk in the creek. Yeah, I, I came up the, the ridge. He hadn't been in there that way, up kind of up the ridge, staying out of the creek. He'd always come up the creek because if you know, really the hardest possible way to do things, that's how he wanted to do it. So our first load out, we were walking down the creek, just feet, you know, if you ever mentioned walking into a creek with 100 and some pounds on your back, you're the, the elders are catching your backpack. I mean, it's exhausting. So on the way back in, I'm like, dude, we gotta stay up on that Ridge. You're gonna, you're gonna. Love the ridge. And it was just like, probably five times easier. Why would

Speaker 3:          00:36:23       walking in the creek be good? The only thing I could think of is if you were so hot from carrying all that weight, that it would cool you off a little bit,

Speaker 2:          00:36:30       but then you'd be wet now. What his thought was, uh, you know, there's so many, so much. The brush is so thick, so if you're not fighting brush, if you're in the creek, you know, usually the creek is pretty open. He had cut, he had cut it. Um, some of the brush has grown over the creek out of the way, so he sort of had a trail cut in there and he came in there that the year before he, I think he killed a bull back in there, so we sorta had a trail cut in there, but the rocky walking in the creek with the slipping and sliding and everything else just, it was, uh, it wasn't, it. We went on the road and he's like, wow, this is way better.

Speaker 3:          00:37:07       Reno is brother fucked as backup. So bad that he had a by llamas. Yeah. He was carrying on an elk and apparently he just fucked as backup. Just Rinella in his brothers. They're all savages. They're all relentless. Sure. There are these fucking hill climbing psycho goat people that just don't get tired and they just push each other. And I'm sure growing up they all pushed each other like knowing Rinella and then hearing the story about his brother. I'm sure they're basically the same way. And that I think he just said fucking tough enough pussy. And he kept going. Just his back was just jacked. So then he got llamas. So now he takes these llamas in a van. And when he drives, he has these llamas. Pack the meat out for them. Yeah, we hit me and really had llamas. We bought Llamas for $100 a piece for the exact same thing. What is it like keeping a Llama?

Speaker 2:          00:37:58       You don't hardly have to deal with anything real. I mean, when you pay $100 for them, who cares? So locked up, falafel, a poor slave lama. No, no, but they're really hardy animals and they can't pack, you know, they can't pack like a horse can pack. But. So if they packed 70 pounds and you've got four of them, well there's 280 pounds. You're not packing on your back, you know, that adds up. So that's all we had them. And uh, they would pack, even if they didn't pack much meat, they'd pack our camp and we could take extra food and things like that. So we'd go in the wilderness with our four llamas and uh, it was great and they just like hang out. Like they don't get cold now and they don't need water either. They're sorta like camels. What? Yeah, you don't even have to worry about water with horses when you have horses in the back country.

Speaker 2:          00:38:48       A wrangling the horses is like a whole different responsibility, a whole extra responsibility. You have to make sure they have water, you have to, you know, feed, they can kind of figure it out in the high country, but they have to get water every day, you know, so you can't be gone from camp with, for an extended periods with llamas. Who Cares? Remy was on a horse hunt and they were riding a horse and uh, one of the guys was on the horse and the horse fell and snapped his leg. The horse broke, his leg was broken, his leg. And uh, the guide just said, all right, well everybody back up. Shoot the horse and so remy was like, well, this seems like it just kind of like leave it here. Yeah. So he cut the backstraps off of it. Off The horse. Off The horse.

Speaker 2:          00:39:34       Yeah. Yeah. That have. I mean, thank you. Cooked it too. Did he say he cooked it? I know I, I had endorsed before. Yeah. I had horse. Had An amazing restaurant in Montreal. Joe Beef twice, two different occasions. They served as horse one time. It was a. You were like, yeah, no, I wouldn't personally, I wouldn't eat what I've seen horses dead in the back country. Same thing. You wouldn't eat a horse. Probably not. Like if somebody, if you went to a restaurant, sucks super fancy restaurants like Joe beef and they served you a horse tenderloin, I'd say, Hey, could I get that filet? You wouldn't, you wouldn't try it. Probably not really to just try it. I, I was, you know, I grew up around horses. I love horses. Uh, have written a lot. And I remember I was hunting in Australia with Adam Green tree and they call them Brumby's back there.

Speaker 2:          00:40:26       So it's just wild horses. And we were sitting there under a tree is hot is, I mean 120 degrees Fahrenheit. It's crazy hot. We're just sitting there boiling. Here's this white stallion coming up Rhombi. And Adam's like, oh that's, that's a beautiful trophy and a this whore. What a beautiful trophy to shoot. Yeah, they shoot them. But yes, they're wild horses. So was just a trophy. What a weird way to look at a horse. Well that's, that's why people hunt, right? Is it for food? I mean, does he eat? The horse wasn't going to do with the horse I shot. People are going to be like fucking psycho now. The thing in Australia is all those are feral animals, so they need to be killed, you know? So there's no law that says you need to take the meat off. Whatever you kill. They just want the animal's dead. It was so strange. There's too many of them. I mean they'll, they'll fly over a parks and just wipe out the buffalo, the water buffalo because they just ruined all the water sources. There's, they don't get killed. There's way too many of them. They were introduced there from Asia and so they need the numbers control.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       They need them gone basically. So yeah, I mean a wild horse, same thing. Their um, their sensibilities are so contrary to ours. When you think about what hunting is over here and went hunting is over there, like for people that are like aghast listening to this, by the way, Adam is fucking awesome. I love this guy. He's not a slight against him. No, he's amazing. But his environment is very different than our environment and this is what's different. Australia didn't have hardly any animals. I mean like Kangaroos and wallabies and some weird shit, but all the animals that they have there have been introduced and they've made some big mistakes along the way. Yeah. And one of the big mistakes was they brought over foxes and they brought over cats and uh, this was a huge mistake because they have wild cat everywhere. Everywhere in Australia.

Speaker 1:          00:42:26       House cats, right? Regular. Like house cats, except they're wild as fuck. And they kill everything. They decimate ground nesting birds. The ground nesting birds just go extinct. Like there's just, they have no chance. And cats are fucking murderers. We've, we've talked about this on the podcast because we did this. Uh, we, we read this study that was done recently on how many animals cats killed per year. I have two cats. I love cats. They're awesome. I've always had, I've had cats my whole life. I love cats. So not a slight against cats. Yeah, they killed billions. Billions. I mean Bei Bei every year in America, just in the US, the fucking murderers and killed in rodents and squirrels and birds. They fucking killed everything. So in Australian hunting magazines, these guys are holding up cats. Yeah. Like with smiles on their face, like they just shot a coyote or some, you know, murderous of willdabeast thing.

Speaker 1:          00:43:23       Not a wildebeest. What's up? Hold the piece. Wouldn't be murderers, some animal that you have to kill, you know, but they're, they're holding up a fucking cat. And you're like, what? Like he said, he gave me one of his magazines while these Australian Max. Yeah. I'm like, this is cat killers incorporated. Look what the fuck kind of magazines is this. A bunch of guys smiling with pictures of cats. Yeah. But in their world, right, like this is a necessary thing, like they have to kill these cats just to keep the population and they're still barely putting a dent in it. Oh yeah. Now. And so the, the end of my story is here comes this white stallion, 20 yards. Perfect. And couldn't shoot it. Yeah. Couldn't do it. Fuck that. Can't kill a horse. I mean, I know. Weird. I haven't, you know, zebras are fairly close to horses and appearance, you know, couldn't. I've never hunted the zebra either. I've been to Africa multiple times and you know, so anyway, it's just, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm not trying to judge anybody for doing it. I'm just saying for me, Rinella had a really good take on this whole cecil the lion thing. And uh, one of the things that he was saying is as a hunter

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       who? Cecil, that's that guy, the dude, he had a brother named Jericho, but his take on it was that as a person who goes out and takes a life and, and, and does this like in a sort of a public manner, like you have an obligation to consume that animal. And so I was saying to him like, well, if you go over to Africa, and he's like, well I've never been Africa and I don't have a desire to go to Africa, but if I did and I shot a line, I'd eat that line. I go, you would. He goes, yeah, I'd eat that line. Yeah. So he won't, he won't shoot anything unless you eat it. Okay. And he's um, he's actually been on many grizzly hunts. Yeah. But he won't haunt coastal grizzlies because he doesn't want a grizzly that's been eaten fish. He wants an inland grizzly.

Speaker 3:          00:45:19       It would be brown bear when it's coastal and inland. What's Grizzly? Right? So he wants an animal that is, you know, most likely eating berries or whatever. So he can, he can actually eat it. It's good. It's a good way to look at it. Yeah, I mean he could still eat the coastal, I mean, Holy Hell No. I've eaten black bear that eat fish and they're okay. You know, at Prince of Wales Island, uh, those blackberry salmon, just like a grizzly and totally different than like an Alberta black bear. Uh, Albert, Alberta black bear really good because their grain fed, it's like a grin. Grain Fed beef, right? Um, but you know, that's like a white tail deer that lives near a farm. Yeah. Like if you get white tailed deer that lived near a farm, mean they're eating Monsanto, GMO corn, right? Yeah, just Kinda, you know, look, it's nature, it's nature, it's organic, it's guaranteed.

Speaker 3:          00:46:12       That's good meat. It's delicious. But my buddy doug, who's got a farm in Wisconsin, Doug during shout out to my buddy doug, uh, his, he has this amazing place in Wisconsin in the driftless area. You know, where Cazenovia is. I down about 90 minutes or so outside of a. What is the Madison I guess? Yeah, about 90 minutes outside of Madison, somewhere around there, but just as stunning place. Beautiful. And anyway, these deer, they're, they're essentially almost like farm animals. Yeah. And they live in conjunction with people like their numbers have never been higher and one of the reasons is because we have these enormous farm areas, like if you, if it was like people who are not aware, if you look at the United States, if you look at the areas that are known for being agriculturally strong, like Kansas, Iowa, those are where all the bucks are. Yeah. That's where all the deer are. If you go to those places. Great Habitat. Yeah. I mean they live healthy and happy because of these farms. Yeah. So they're almost farm animals in some weird way. A little bit. I mean there's no, they're not fenced in now. Not fenced in, but it's a lot of work. They're tuned in, man. They're fucking ears are going left and right. They're looking for everybody there. Keep

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       an eye on predators are notoriously skittish. Yeah, they're tuned in. They are very aware that their desired. Yeah. Someone's trying to jack them to just like in the really big ones. It's an interesting thing. Um, they don't come out in the daytime.

Speaker 2:          00:47:45       A lot of times they're only weaknesses. The rut when it's breeding season. And so then that's when that's a chink in their armor. So they're, they want to breed, they want to find that hot, that dough that's in the heat. It sounds like you in estrus

Speaker 1:          00:47:57       and you too, Jamie. I'm judging everybody. It sounds like everybody. But when you point at somebody, you know there's four fingers pointing back at you. Not The way I point. I point gangster style. Oh, this says all fire at Jamie and you at some point I'm pointing to the devil. My thumb pointing to you with my finger and my other fingers are going to Jamie. Well judge a way that makes you feel better. It does. It's weird how it works that way. It makes me feel way better. They got better than people. I just like to not look at my own fault at all and I just, it makes me feel super comfortable. Right. All I focus on is my fault. So I'd like to. I'd like to try your noble. So Noble, it seems like a lot of work, but at these areas in our country that are primarily agricultural areas that have these massive deer populations, that is the number one most hunted animal in North America as white tail deer, most desired animal in America. It's interesting how a mule deer, which are also spectacular animals, but conversely are almost totally wild. These are mountain animals and nail the occasion to go into fields and stuff too. And near farms for sure. But uh, finding a lot of these animals, like they're just totally, completely wild. And for some people those animals, because of the fact they're wild, become like a more desirable animal.

Speaker 2:          00:49:26       Um, it's like, uh, the mountains are, I don't want to say Romanticize, but people look at the mountains differently. It seems like, you know, just just being in the mountains is powerful in itself. So when you're hunting an animal that is a mountain monarch, so to speak, a big bull elk, sheep, a very noble animal that lives exclusively in the mountains and a mountain mule deer in bowhunters know. Especially, you know, I don't want to say I was going to say Western boners no, but any bowhunter knows that tries to go after a mule deer and the mountains. That's about as tough of a bow hunters you're going to get. I mean because elk, for me, I've killed most of my bowls. Spa and stock. I'm not calling them in and to stock and elk is pretty easy. I'm just compared to a mule deer. Not Easy in general. Just, you know, not like easy as going to a store and buying a pop, but easy, easy to get close to them. Yeah. See, compared to mule deer because

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       they're. They make noise themselves, so they're big animals. Eight hundred pounds kicking rocks, break and branches, so they're making noises so you can get away with some noise. If a mule deer is laying up and it's bad on top of a rim rock, all it is is laying there at the back protected because it's backed up against a rock wall and it's looking down this, the winds coming up so it can smell everything that's below him. Nothing you can get at them from behind them and they're with their big ears, you know, that's what, that's why they got the name mule deer. They're uh, they're big ears. They're just listening. All they're doing is observing, smelling the wind and listening very, very hard to get in bell range of. Yeah, that's a weird animal, man. It's uh, it's interesting how they move to they bounce, you know, like a lot of animals are running deer, white tail deer mostly Kinda run.

Speaker 1:          00:51:21       But mule deer are literally bouncing up in the air, like some sort of a cartoon rabbit. Yeah. Point point. I don't know. I guess I've never even, you know, obviously I know that because I've seen it. I've spooked plenty of mule deer, but uh, I don't know if it's to get up and to have a better view of what might have spoke to them or what danger might be there to be high. I don't know. I'd be interesting to find out why there's any theories on why they do that. They kind of make sense. If they live in fields, which a lot of them do, there's, there goes one Boeing, look at them go boing. Boing, boing, boing. What a weird animal. That's fucking weird is a Weirdo. They do that. They this very strange look at the size of his ears. Yup. Have you never seen a mule deer before folks?

Speaker 1:          00:52:06       They have ears that are just enormous. Yeah. And he's bouncing, pining towards a good book and they're huge. Yeah. They. Um, and that's actually so an achilles heel of a mule deer is those ears if it's windy because all the hair in their ear. So if the wind is really blowing and the grass where they're bedded is blowing around or that even the wind is blowing the hair on their ears around, they can't hear. So if it's windy, you can get close to them. Uh, if it's dead calm, Foxville, it's not going to be easy. But if it's windy that's uh, that's one way. You know, if I'm bowhunting, if I had the wind right and it's gusting, I feel pretty good, pretty good. I can get in. It is interesting too that these animals that are more difficult to get to, and this is a one thing that is contrary to the way a lot of people think about hunting, lease at the highest level, the animals that are the most difficult to get to in the hunts that are most difficult or the most prized, and it's one of the reasons why people like you gravitate towards bowhunting because bowhunting is far more difficult than rifle hunting and then the animals that are the most difficult to bowhunt become the most prized for a lot of people like wild desert, bighorn sheep.

Speaker 1:          00:53:24       They'll stone sheep,

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       dall sheep. When you have to go to these really crazy places that are really high up in the mountains, very difficult to get there in the first place and then good luck sneaking up on them. Your wide out in the open on this gigantic mountain with all this shale and rocks and I mean those are the animals that people prize. In some strange way that these hunters like the difficulty of the hunt, the tougher it is to camp out there. The difficulty in the conditions that tough for those conditions are the more people sort of like pro like praise those kinds of experiences. It's the challenge. It's what it's why we bow hunt. Um, and that's just a, that's just a prime example of the greatest challenge there is, you know, in the mountains in those tough conditions with a bow. Um, yeah, it's hard as it get.

Speaker 3:          00:54:17       So we bow hunt because we like challenge and we put those animals on pedestals because they're the ultimate challenge. Yeah. And it's for people that don't hunt, they don't, they probably are not, not only they're not aware of this, but it might not even make that much sense that this is one of the reasons why those animals are like people saying, Oh, you know, it doesn't like how many times do I read this? It doesn't take any skill. You know, what you're doing is horrible entirely. It's one of the most difficult things you could do in the world if you want to try to feed yourself with a bow and an Arrow, a stick, and a string. You want to try to feed yourself with that? Yeah. Good luck. Yeah. The people that say there's no skill involved in bowhunting, haven't done it. They definitely happen, but it's also, it's, it's in a can in inconsiderate convenient way of dismissing something that they don't agree with because of their ideology and with a lot of the people.

Speaker 3:          00:55:13       There are people that eat meat, which is really weird. It's like you're eating meat and you're dismissing someone who's doing one of the most difficult things in the world with meat. Yeah. Well, I guarantee you. No, I know there's people out there who don't hunt who, um, respect animals. No, I get that. But those people could never have the same amount of respect. I don't think as a hunter who knows what it takes to survive up there, what it takes to outwit the animal up there, what it takes to be successful and to get that, that the meat off the mountain after you've harvested one. The amount of respect. That whole process builds in a hunter. There's no way. Somebody who hasn't done it could appreciate or match. I don't know whether or not they could appreciate it as much. I just don't think they understand the experience.

Speaker 3:          00:56:04       I don't think they understand the beauty that some people find in that experience because I think in their eyes, if you take life, this is a negative thing, a terrible thing, but the way I always kind of look at it like that, there's a storm going on out there. Okay. Close Your door. Watch game of thrones, sit in your air conditioned apartment. Drink your soda and like, Oh, life is beautiful. I don't know why anybody would go out there and kill an animal. There's a storm of animals killing animals out there. It's happening right now while we're sitting in this beautiful air conditioned studio here in lovely Woodland Hills, California. There is a fucking storm or coyotes or kill and deer and bears are killing each other and that fucking picture that we posted that you showed me, I said I was going to post later today of that polar bear carrying around that cubs head.

Speaker 3:          00:56:57       Yeah. Fuck man. Real life that that's going on right now and all you're doing is a hunter. Is you're choosing to not go the factory farm route and to make this experience of gathering your food a massive challenge and an incredibly rewarding experience and you connect yourself to the wild in some really bizarre way that I never understood until I started doing it. Once I. Once I started, like I always thought, well this is probably the better way to get meat. Yeah, but once I started doing it this logically, you thought it made sense, right? Exactly. Yeah, but I had no real connection now, but when you get that spiritual connection with the animals that the country, the challenge, your own human spirit and what it takes, that's where the powerful, how, how powerful hunting is really. It's driven home. Well, it's just, it's, it's, it's kind of psychedelic in a way and people had gotten mad at me because I've said this and this is what I mean by Psychedelic, like the.

Speaker 3:          00:58:01       I mean even hunting an animal and looking in his eyes. It's psychedelic and some sort of a weird way because it's, it's paradigm shifting and it's, it sort of, it changes your view. It like takes you out of perspective shifting thing because when you're actually in this animal's environment, you're in this really quiet forest and you're, you're sneaking up on this animal and you, you, you're pursuing it and you're hunting it and you lock eyes with this thing and in this, this animal's world, this animal doesn't know anything about culture. It doesn't know anything about your traditions or your rules or your ideas or your ethics or what you think should and shouldn't be done. This thing is just trying to survive. That's it and some very strange way where it is. Not only is it trying to survive, it's trying to keep other things from doing what it wants to do.

Speaker 3:          00:58:57       It wants to stab these other deer with his antlers so that they can't fuck the girls that it wants to fuck. He wants to pass on its genes in some incredibly primitive competition. Yeah. This gene competition that's going on and some sort of a way where they're not, they're not. They're not intellectualizing it. Now they're not thinking about it like, well, what I want to do is pass on my name because my boys are going to be the hanes boys and their hands boys never quit. No, they are not thinking like that. They're not thinking there. No nobleness it. All it is is survival and and breeding. It's some sort of a nature mathematics thing that's going on and you know this, this world is this savage, primal, crazy world and what you're doing as a hunter is entering into that world. Now, what people who don't have don't seem to understand is that the people that do hunt are responsible directly for the population increase of all these animals and it's very contradictory in a lot of ways.

Speaker 3:          00:59:59       These people, they don't like the people that, that don't like hunting, but love animals don't understand that the numbers are where they are now directly because of people contributing to wildlife preservation to habitat preservation and to making sure that wildlife biologist manage these areas properly and that's like, that's a hard pill to swallow for people who love animals, but the people who are spending the most amount of money to keep these animals healthy, want to go kill them and eat them. Yeah. It's a, it's like many things in life. It doesn't necessarily add up the way you'd like it. It seems contradictory, but hunters are why there's more, you know, we looked this up last time. More deer, elk bear Turkey numbers than there ever has been in North America. So I mean, um, I think elk is. Elk doesn't occupy as much area as it used to be, but that was because the assholes who were around in the 18 hundreds who came along first or the 16, 17 and 18 hundreds.

Speaker 3:          01:00:59       They just shot the shit out of him know. And they were doing it for me to stay alive. A lot of it was also, uh, Dan Flores, who was on Ronell's podcast, if you haven't listened to that and the mediator podcast, listen to this one because it's sensational. He's a wildlife historian and talks about the history of wildlife in North America and the same guys that killed off massive amounts of buffalo in this country and all of sudden almost made them extinct. They did the same thing with pronghorns. They did the same thing with elk. They just, these were guys who came back from the wars and they just had no skills other than killing things. And this was a way to make money for the market. So they would go out and just slaughter wholesale slaughter of these animals when they ran out of Buffalo, they turned to the antelope and for hide and for all these other things.

Speaker 3:          01:01:48       And you know, human beings can be this incredibly thoughtless consumer. And I think that that's, that's that connection for. It's unfairly connected to hunting. Yeah. And some sort of a way. Well now. And that's, you know, Hunter's, nowadays I think we're doing a good job at driving home. The point hunting is conservation, you know, rocky mountain now [inaudible] has helped, uh, they coined that term and it's true, you know, hunters are out there doing, doing the work, paying the money. Um, yeah, we're killing animals, but it's to the benefit of the animals. Also, Ben. Oh, Brian has an interesting take on that. Uh, our friend Benno Brian who used to work at Peterson's and now I'm worse at Yeti coolers. He says conservation is something that comes along. It's a byproduct of it. But really it's about hunting. Yeah. And I think that's, that's the honest answer.

Speaker 3:          01:02:40       Oh No, I'm. When I'm out there hunting, I'm not thinking I needed to be the best conservationists. I can't. I mean, no, I'm out there to be successful. But that mantra, it gets kind of, it's an argument mantra. It's like people that are hunting are dealing with so much pressure from people that are angry about hunting. Right. That and then this is a different world too, because you were saying when you grew up that hunters were thought of as like, wow, this guy provides for his family. He goes out and does this incredibly difficult thing. It's very noble hunters were looked at with respect. I mean, you looked up to a hunter, you're like, you know, if somebody was successful, did you get your elk this year? Yeah. Oh Man. You know that guy. He's a stud. It's tough to do. Tough to do. Went out and did it.

Speaker 3:          01:03:23       So hunters were put on a pedestal when I grew up in the town I grew up and where I lived and it was. There was something, you know, you had pride that you hunted. Well, this is what I think is good about all this controversy that when you were doing this, when you were young, there was no social media and so you weren't engaging with people that thought in a contrary way that thought different, that we're upset by your actions and they weren't engaging with you either. Right? They looked at hunters like elmer Fudd, you know, they looked at him like some guy hunters in a movie or always this drunk guy was out there shooting at anything that moved. Bad Guy, the bad guy, oh, he's a bad guy, and that was their perception and your perception was based on your environment where you're in an area that's pretty, pretty rural, a lot of wildlife, a lot of hunters, and it's a super normal part of the environment, the culture.

Speaker 3:          01:04:17       So these people that are urban, that are just conditioned to thinking of animals as being pet that you love and food is being something that gets you get from a grocery store. Even the people that buy meat, they're not involved in any way, shape or form in the killing of that meat. So they're completely disconnected from it. So this, even though there's like this craziness going on where these animal rights people are saying, I hope your mother gets raped and killed and murdered and gutted in front of your children and all this crazy shit that I've seen these angry, angry people that think of. Well, I don't know if there's a lot going on. I don't know if they're actually angry in as much that made it into like a logical progression where it makes sense or if it's just they feel like they have the right to go after you because you're killing things and they're really just fucking imbalanced.

Speaker 3:          01:05:09       There's a lot of that and there's a lot of imbalanced people that do really good things because it allows them to be really aggressive in their negative. They're negative behavior. Like there's some people that love to be negative and they love to be aggressive and they love to be shitty and insulting and and hostile and the way to ensure that that behavior is not just accepted but actually rewarded is to be negative and hostile and even violent for a good cause. Yeah. Yeah, and so they're masking their really psychotic, fucked up behavior. It looks. One of the things like people's like being a, being an animal rights person or being a Vegan is about compassion. Except when you're talking to people that don't agree with you and then you're allowed to get fucking super hostile and super negative and violent and self righteous. Call us murderers and say we deserve to die and they would like to kill us.

Speaker 3:          01:06:03       So they're tolerant until you know there's a cause. A cause that you know is you have to actually think to justify and you have to actually look at the big picture, you know, but when it's easy and say, Oh, you hunt, you're a murderer, right? I wish you were dead. That's easy. Yeah. Well, it's, it's in it. I understand it, I understand it. I understand where they're coming from and I understand their perspective of someone who actually does love animals. I understand that this contradiction is very difficult to deal with and that's one of the things that I think is important about this new age of interaction is that some people are kind of getting the understanding. They're getting the message like, okay, I thought that this thing was about these people that hated animals that went out and shot him and killed him. But now I'm seeing that this thing also has a lot of different layers to it and there's a broad range of these people and the noble ones are actually doing not just a service to the wildlife.

Speaker 3:          01:07:01       They're stewards of the wildlife and stewards of the land and there are also up there getting their food. They're getting the healthiest food that a person can eat right from the wild and that this idea that you can somehow or another have no harm and do no harm to animals. Well that's not true. You can't do no harm. And we said, well, you could do less harm. Depends on what you think less harm means. Because if you're talking about bugs, are bugs life. If you're talking about rodents, if you're talking about things that get chewed up when they, when they processed grain, right, you're not. Animals are dying and if you, and if you procreate, boy, that's a fucking ball of wax right there. That's a bag of worms or whatever it is. What is the expression? Bag of worms. It was a bag of wax.

Speaker 3:          01:07:49       I can wax. If you procreate, boy your your you, you are creating a beautiful little baby human being that is going to consume and it's gonna Cause waste. It's going to burn fossil fuels into the atmosphere. It's going to promote global warming. It's going to have plastic that most likely will wash up into the ocean. It's going to be a consumer of all these things and there's no way around that. So if you love people like I do, I've hugged and love people. People are destroyers. Yeah. Dislike. You know, just like bears eat cubs. People make a certain amount of waste. Yeah, and hopefully we can figure out a way to balance that out as people get more and more complex in their ability to utilize recycled materials and maybe even possibly turn some of the waste that we pump out into the air. There was discussion about that, about extracting pollution from the air and using it as fuel and there'd be some way to do that.

Speaker 3:          01:08:51       I don't. I know that scientists are actually trying to come up with feasible methods of taking places that are just like really polluted and actually using that pollutants are those pollutants and turning it into some sort of a product that we can use. They're smarter than me. I know that me too, but I'm, I'm, I'm help. I'm hopeful. But what I'm saying is that we're all in some way responsible for some sort of an impact on the world that we live in and just like dog shit on the ground and you know, cats kill every fucking thing they get a chance to. That's their design. That's what they're supposed to do.

Speaker 2:          01:09:27       There's nothing more friendly to a hunter. I can tell you that, you know, if you're talking about, um, helping the environment, getting out there, killing yourself, processing it, bringing it home, that's, you know, that's about as good as it gets as far as ECO friendly. And, uh, I think, I think we're getting that message out there on the positive attributes of hunting. I mean, we've talked about this a number of times. You've talked about it with other guests number times, and I see, yeah, I still see a lot of hate, anger, misunder not misunderstanding, but they don't want to understand. It doesn't feel like. But on the other side I get messages from a lot of people who are saying, I've never thought about hunting now way I'm interested in providing for myself. I wanted to be self sufficient. I'm trying, I'm getting a bow. So I mean, you know, we're doing good things also. I mean I know we, we talk about the negative lot and we focus on that. I mean, you know, if you look at it, if you look at my social media stuff, I do notice the negatives. I'm probably too much so I mean I know we talk about that, but man, there's a lot of positive out there too,

Speaker 3:          01:10:33       is way more positive than there is negative now, but it's all in what you focus on. If you decided to focus on the negative, there'd be way more negative. Yeah, I mean you can definitely find it. Yeah. Just put Hashtag Vegan on all your posts and watch what happens. That's what you do. I only did it once. Oh my God, I get so upset. And it was, it was over a joke. It was a joke, but it was, it had meat in it. Can't handle jokes now. But I think that, um, just these conversations, they're, they're important. It's also important for people that are there. They're in chanted by maybe a more radical, a animal activist perspective and you know, it seems to make sense, but sometimes the that needs to be balanced out and you need to consider both sides. And I think the hunting side is not represented enough in an intelligent way.

Speaker 3:          01:11:28       We're, it balances out some of the more radical and also proselytizing like they're trying to convert people into their world in a lot of ways. Like a lot of people that are animal rights people were Vegan. People are really actively trying to get people to do what they do and get super upset when people find it unhealthy or no longer do it. Yeah. It meanwhile, 95 percent of the world consumes meat 95 percent. But when people go back and that used to be Vegan and they say, I just fucking, my whole body's falling apart, my hair's falling out, my skin is to dry, have no energy, and this is a really common. People say, well, it's because you're doing it wrong. Not necessarily. There's a lot of aspects like you. I'm not saying you should or shouldn't do it, but there's a lot of aspects that if you talk to an actual scientist, real nutritionist, people who are experts in human biology and the direct mechanisms of absorbing nutrients, there's some real issues with plant versions of many different things including vitamin B. Twelve have a bunch of different fatty acids that although they are active in some plants and seeds and oils which are probably good for you, they're actually not nearly as bio available as fatty fish and you know, Dah Da.

Speaker 3:          01:12:40       And a lot of, um, a lot of different essential fatty acids, Omega threes and sixes and all these different things. They're more, more biologically available to human beings in animal form. And this is just science. This is getting a forget about the idea that you shouldn't do it because what's talk about like what is good for the human body itself, but it's, it's fucking hard to get the same stuff from plants and if it's important to you and you want to do it, you can do, you can. But my driver yesterday, um, he, he switched into was a Vegan. He's a Vegan now and um, so he was telling me that actually since he started with his veganism, he eats way less healthy because while he's not eating meat, he's eating potato chips and he's eating all these carbs and all of these empty carbs and there's just like, yeah, so I'm not eating me, but man, I feel terrible and I'm eating awful Doritos.

Speaker 3:          01:13:38       There's no meat and Doritos but not that great for you as well. Sam Harris, who was on our podcast recently, he recently can be converted to being a Vegan as well because of the honest concerns with factory farming and things along those lines. And uh, his blood lip, it's, we're all fucked up and he's like, I gotta figure this out because you know, you're eating carbs all the time. Your body just, your insulin spikes, your blood sugar level spikes. It's just not necessarily healthy unless you, you have to approach it the right way. You got to eat a lot of like healthy things like almond butters, really important nuts, macadamia nuts, you gotta, you gotta find a way to get oils and fats from your foods. And also the way that affects brain function, it gets, it's really important that you have a certain amount of Omega is to really to have your fucking brain conduct properly.

Speaker 3:          01:14:30       It's like having good spark plugs in your fucking car. Well, I ate a lot of meat and I feel pretty healthy. But it's, it's also, there's a debate where, you know, you say, well, someone who is a Vegan does less harm. And that there's definitely an argument for that. If you accept a hierarchy of life. And this is where it gets tricky because what they're saying is that you should not think that a human beings life is more important that an animal's life because that's speciesism. Right. Have you heard that? This is new. I said, well, I saw a Kat von d put up a little thing on her instagram and it had, it had like a man at the top of the food chain basically. And that was labeled as ego and then it had man mixed in with all the other animals and that was ego.

Speaker 3:          01:15:22       That's interesting. Well, ECO is man mixed in with all the other animals if you eat them, if you consume them the way they consume each other. I like, I'm not saying it's egotistical, but I'm saying man is a top of the food chain. Well yeah. Duh. And I don't have, I don't, I'm not hiding that fact. I don't feel bad about that. Now I'm a big fan of people, but also a Kat von d needs to consider. And I love cat. Her tattoos are most likely not Vegan inc is made with animal products. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's a part of tattoo ink and they do have some Vegan inks now, but um, the idea that all those tattoos that she has are all Vegan dot. Alright. Yeah. That sounds rough. What's better? It was Vegan Inc is good. Wonder if it's a one or if it's less good.

Speaker 3:          01:16:10       I don't know if it's like Vegan chicken. Let me, I'm going to start protocols. Taste. Yeah. Um, but my point is the accepting the hierarchy of life. Because if you buy commercial grain, you're directly responsible for an industry that kills a lot of beings now are the pesticides. Unless you buy everything organic from fucking handpick farm when you absolutely know that no one had any, absolutely no pesticides were done, no one had anything that they put into the ground that's dangerous to any of the life that's not likely. Now, keep the likely case is that if you're buying pasta or if you're buying rice or if you're buying any of these things, you're buying these things from some sort of a farm that displaces wildlife, kills, massive amounts of rodents and bugs and all these different things in. Is a bug worth as much as the life of NLC.

Speaker 3:          01:17:06       We need to make this discussion. This is an important. Is a mouse as worth as much as a white tail deer, right? I don't know if it is, but I know that millions of rodents are killed in this country every year with green combines and with that illustration where all the animals are mixed in with the man. I guess everybody's equal, right? So why would it be okay to have wheat harvested? Buzzards flying all around that field because of all the carnage down below and they're scavengers, so all the the road and saw the, the rabbits, all the pheasants, even white tail fawn, maybe all the animals that are killed and they're. They're coming down to eat those. So in the harvest of that wheat bread for that week or the week for the bread, all of these animals died. Well, if everything's equal, why is that okay?

Speaker 3:          01:17:55       But hunting isn't, it doesn't make any sense. No, but it's, it's a convenient way of looking at things and it's also like bug spray. I used to live near an Ashram in boulder and uh, the fucking lady who ran the restaurant was poisoning nance. And I go, Hey, what'd you do when she was using ant poison? She's like, well, we do what we have to. Sometimes when we have ants would go, you're not supposed to. You're a vegetarian. She's a Vegan and you don't believe in killing life unless these conti bugs at that tried to invade your camp and then you kill them in mass with toxic chemicals. You spray from the sky in these canisters of death. I mean, what a weird sort of a game you're playing in your head about life and death is an insect's life worth less than a mammal's life.

Speaker 3:          01:18:50       Well, why is that? Well, because an insect is not as much aware. You ever tried to Swat a fly? Yeah, there's a reason why they get the fuck out of the way. They don't want to die. They know. Okay. So, but is an insect's life worth less than a mouse? Some people would say yes. Okay. Why is that? Well, a mouse is a had as emotions and see. Okay, okay. Alright, well then we're accepting a hierarchy. Well, these animals that can't communicate, they're not as good as people. Okay, so we're going to eat them because it makes you healthier. That's, I mean, is that we accept in this. No, we're not. Well then you got to stop eating grain man, because you're, you're, you're a part of wholesale slaughter. You have to. Well, I think it goes back to, uh, there's a lot of hypocritical people there, but they're prostitize.

Speaker 3:          01:19:33       This is where it gets really weird. I was watching this guy give this argument about how human beings are not designed to eat meat. That's why we can't kill an animal with our hands and our teeth and we have to cook it in order to process it. That's the only way our body consumes it. Well, guess what? Fuck face. Try eating wheat. Yeah, try pulling rice out of the ground and eating that. We process everything, man. We process. We process rice, we process many grains and beans. We process a lot of shit because we're smart. We figured out how to use tools a long time ago. Yeah, we figured out how to burn things. It makes it compatible and your body adjusted to the fact that you were cooking off the bacteria and these things all the time. Your gut flora changes. There's a whole process going on, man.

Speaker 3:          01:20:15       There's a whole evolutionary process involving tools and fire and that's why we have cities and that's why you have a fucking youtube account where you can make these ridiculous claims in the first place. It's all designed by people overcoming the wild environment because I don't know if you checked, but we're fleshy. Little water balloons of blood. That's what we are. We're. We're really vulnerable. Without all these tools and all these houses and all these fucking people that figured out fire and metal and all this shit long before you were alive. The reason why you're alive today is because really ingenious, inventive, industrious people figured out how to survive in a world where we could shit. We're weak and vulnerable and the animals come in and just her jack and things left and right, and we're out there with their little baby in this world. Did you hear about the fucking 15 year old kid? They get pulled out of a fucking tent by a Hyena by his face. He got yanked out of a fucking 10 by his face. Oh, we're going to go on a happy camping trip. This kid is just hanging out in the natural world. I love animals because they love you too. You Fuck? They love to eat. You look at this boy. 15 had his face chewed by a Hyena as he slept in a tent next to it.

Speaker 1:          01:21:28       Carrots in the Kruger National Park. Yeah. That's. That's the real deal that his bones were crushed. Like a packet of crisps. Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah. Oh my God. Hyenas are brutal. Teen was conscious throughout the attack and now undergoing surgery. Oh Huh. Only saved when his uncle heard him being dragged like a blanket Hyena was looking for food had been seen in the week before. The attack. If you've ever seen a Hyena hose, things are. I mean they're killers. Yeah. Well that's why they're there. That's why they're there. Nature has this very efficient system. All they do is kill and they don't care what it is they're killing it. Well, Africa in particular is so fascinating to me. I was going to go on vacation there with my family this year, but I found out we'd have to get a bunch of shots. You went to Tanzania, did you get a bunch of shots?

Speaker 1:          01:22:24       I'm not giving my six year olds some crazy shots so they can endure Zika, that Orient Malaria. That's a big one. How much did you have to. What kind of shots did you have to get? I don't know. I got like I think four different shots, but you know, when I was in camp there, there was uh, one of the workers there had malaria. It's not what you want to get. And what was the, what was it like a, he's just weak and you know, sick and given him antibiotics, I don't know what they're doing. Yeah. I wonder if they even have antibiotics and a lot of places. Right? I don't know. I mean it's a lot different than here, but it's a, it's a brutal place. Well, life is

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       in this weird cycle. We are so soft here. I mean, I just think we're getting weaker and weaker. Um, but yeah, over there, if you're a week, you're gone. Well, everywhere where it's hard. When, when things get rough, when things are not rough, that's when people can relax. And that's one of the beautiful things about cities. We figured out a way to put up these concrete structures that nothing can get in. No, no wild things can get in and you can take a break, relax and eat chips, get fat. But I hate it here. I like it. I like it in the mountains where I am vulnerable, where, you know, hopefully my training and my experience and whatever keeps me alive. But also there's a weird sort of electric feeling to that world, this like a, I want to say electric, but it's stimulating feeling to that world when you're walking around in that world and you're acutely aware that you are now part of this system and that you could turn the wrong corner, run into a fucking grizzly bear.

Speaker 3:          01:24:08       You could turn the wrong corner and run into a mountain lion. It doesn't happen a lot, but it could happen. You could fall, you know, like your friend Roy. So it's, uh, yeah, I mean, that's where, I mean, that's where I feel most alive obviously, because you have to be, you know, if you're not in tune, um, who knows what happens. It seems like also that there's some, some reward systems that are built into being a human being. They get like little switches that gets snapped on when you're out there that you didn't, I didn't even know existed. And it's what I've seen with many people who are very smart people who become hunters, who then they start talking about it. They articulate really similar thoughts that it becomes a, the the, the act of consuming becomes very different when you acquire it the hard way.

Speaker 3:          01:25:03       Yeah, same as. There's a feeling that you get is a much more muted version of it, but it's a really good feeling that you get when you grow a salad and you're eating that salad grew in your own yard. Yeah, but that's a much more muted. It's a, it's a beautiful feeling. It feels nice. It feels satisfying, but it's much more muted. Like when I cook an elk steak. Yeah. That's something that I, I, I was there for the entire time, you know, when it got shot, helped cut it up and carry it out. Yeah. There's a, there's a memory attached to that. There's a primal satisfaction attached to that and there's also this feeling like, I know that thing wasn't penned up. I know that thing didn't get stuffed full of hormones. I know that thing didn't get tortured before it died. I know it wasn't corralled into this area and then they shoot a fucking piston into its brain while it's watching.

Speaker 3:          01:25:54       All of his friends die in the same way. Yeah, I know it. I don't know if they know. I don't know if they have friends though. Debt buddies to hang out. They have a pit in the pin. They hang out until, until pussies out like many other friends. Then the backstabbing begins. Literally. They stab each other in the back with their antlers. It's brutal out there. But yeah, I mean I, that connection a hunter has with it with the animal and, and just be able to bring that home and cook it up and sit around the table. That's just with your family. I mean, that's how it's always been. That's how it's always been since the beginning of time. Being a provider is a powerful thing and I wonder if this new trend away from the. I wonder what's going on with human beings and uh, if it is just a natural progression of creating structures and safety and society in the sense of civilization, the way we think of it today, I wonder if it's a natural sort of progression to slowly but surely move away from that world, that wild world, and to get more and more accustomed with the idea of us creating our own food from some other way, like by detaching from how you grow your vegetables, by detaching from where your meat comes from, that were like setting ourselves up to go further and further down this road of not really being an animal anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:27:17       Being some new kind of weird thing. I'm not going that way. You're not going, well, you're not going that way, this, this, this life. Now in this life, you're, you're in this sort of a transitionary stage. Or the culture is our society as a demon. Ends are. You're digging and digging in as a, as a hunter. You're going old school staying old school, but it me as a person who like halfassed scientist who tries to study human beings trying to figure out what the fuck I'm doing. I wouldn't even use the word scientists loosely, something else, whatever I am, but when I look at it, I'm always like, what is going on here? Because there's clearly something going on with human beings as an organism. Like there's something going on where we're moving away from the natural world with cities. We're moving away from the natural world with our ability to control our environment.

Speaker 3:          01:28:05       It's hot as fuck outside right now and you and I feel great. How are you feeling, jamie? Field? Great. Ace is nice, right? It's beautiful. So we figured out a way to live in these harsh environments with no consequences whatsoever except on in the environment itself. It's consequences about the. But there's also this detachment from the concerns of the world and it's one of the things that I've always said about La is that La is one of the most unnatural places in the world because not just because everyone's full of shit because they're trying to get you to think there's something they're not. So you put them in a TV show or a movie, but also because it doesn't rain here. Yeah, it's always perfect. You could sleep outside and you're fine. There's not that much wildlife worry about. There's so many mountain lions, they killed all the deer. You don't even get in car accidents against deere. Like our connection to wildlife is like fucking nil. Yeah. I, I don't think being comfortable all the time. I don't think, you know, La and cities

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       like La. I don't, it's not good. I mean it's not good to, to uh, eliminate all the challenges of being a human. I mean, that's why. That's why I like getting out there and just being immersed in challenge because I don't know. I mean, how do you appreciate how good you have a when you never have it hard? That is a big point. That's a big point. It's a big point. That was hammered home for me when I came back from Prince of Wales. From unsuccessful hunt. Yeah. We're out there for five or six days I think, and it was pouring rain every day. It was cold as shit. Every day your fingers are pruned up and you're freezing your dick off and you just can't wait to get back home and when I got back home to La, my God, it was glorious. I called up or now I go, dude, I don't think I've ever been happier in my life.

Speaker 1:          01:29:49       Everyday was like so nice. I. It felt so good, like it was so nice to see my friends. It was so nice to to see the sun. I called up Callan and he said the same thing. He's like, dude, I feel great. I just feel so thankful to be back. I feel so thankful to be in a city where I don't have to worry about where my food comes from. We don't have to worry about starving to death. Yeah. It makes you appreciate this weird thing that we've gotten and I think when you don't experience both things, that's when you take it for granted. Yeah. Yeah. So if you never would have went, you never even had those feelings. You know, and I, I think it's important. I think it's an that's why I like when people want to take on the challenge of hunting, want to learn more about it.

Speaker 1:          01:30:32       Um, the byproduct yet we've talked about the positive byproduct is you're conservation is another byproduct is you're going to realize what, what it's like to be uncomfortable and then, you know, conversely you're going to realize how good we have it and um, how you appreciate being able to walk up to the tap and fill up a glass of water. I mean, I've been on a lot of haunts were just getting water was like, okay, here's the focus of the day. I need to find water. Yeah, that's it. Well, you were drinking buffalo piss water. Yeah. When you guys weren't. This is a crazy story because it also involved crocodiles when you guys were in Australia and you decided you and crazy fucking Adam green tree decided let's bring no food. Go out into the Bush where it's 120 degrees. We'll definitely shoot a buffalo and we'll just eat that.

Speaker 1:          01:31:23       Yeah, yeah. We're, we're gonna. We're gonna live quote, live off the land. And uh, that's probably just happy he found someone dumb enough to do that with them Saturday night. I can't believe you listened to me, mate. Everybody else has me to fuck off. Yeah, it hit him. And a Owen Strano was there too. But uh, and Owen, I think he might've brought man. Did he, would he have maybe a, some kind of a, a bar? I don't know what he had. I had half of a trail mix thing that I bought at the airport, you know, and that, that was like gold, but yeah. So we're going to live off the land and uh, yeah, it was, it was miserable. But, uh, so did he talk you into this? Was it your idea or his idea? Like who? It was, his idea, of course. No, it's great.

Speaker 1:          01:32:08       No, I thought sounded awesome. He's out there shooting the horses and cats should go. Come on. Let's live off the land. No, I thought it sounded great. I mean it was fine. It was, you know, I'm used to being miserable. A little food would have been nice because as you know, like I said today I need to eat like every hour because you run so much. Actually I'm starving right now. But uh, that's uh, well before we launched the new Cameron Hanes podcast, which we will this afternoon. I, we'll get you a protein bar. There you go. Alright. I saw I saw a quest bar back there. Yeah, there's a lot. We've got boxes of shit back there. Plenty of I'm going to steal. But yeah. So just, just living off the land took on a whole nother challenge to a hard hunt already. And so I was down for sure.

Speaker 1:          01:32:51       So you guys were eating only things that you had shot and then drinking water that you found in the water that you found was all filled with buffalo piss? Yeah, because again, too many buffalo, I mean, when you say too many, if you, if anybody's ever watched any of the videos on the numbers of buffalo from Asia, these are enormous. What do the Cape Buffalo, whatever they know, these are water buffalo water buffalo and North Cape Buffaloes. African won the fight the lines. Yep. Enormous giant beasts that are videos on that. Jamie. Huge, huge herds of these things. Yeah. No, but they're pretty wary still. I mean they're big animals, but uh, they're not quite, not quite as worried as a Cape Buffalo, I don't think because they don't have lions hunting them, you know, but when they're around water, they're used to, the crocodiles been in there.

Speaker 1:          01:33:41       They definitely are, are used to, uh, looking out for themselves. So they're huge animals. Um, they can be dangerous because just because they're so big. But uh, it's their survivors for sure. If that's another weird animal to hunt in Australia, they hunt domestic cows. Yeah, call him scrubble scribbles. Yeah. And what a scrub Boulez is a domestic cow that got loose, you know, many, many generations ago and now have become completely feral and you're dealing with bowls and you know how like when you ride bulls folks that they buck and kick and you know how the matador stands in the middle and the bull just fucking charges him. Tries to kill him. Yeah. That's what bulls do in the wild times 10. So you have these wild for hyper aggressive masses of muscle. And this is a video, it says cams raw. What does it say? What does the net cams. Raw and uncut. Ozzie water buff heart shot. Yeah. And this is you sneaking up on this massive animal. You've got to walk super slow. Yeah. The thing about it is a, they'll pick up movement, but as he's feeding there, I know I can move so I just go very slowly. I had my range finder up near my face so I don't have to reach for it and, and do a bunch of extra movement there.

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       But if you, uh, how far away is he? Right here? Probably 50 yards now with the animals. Is that big? Why did you decide to keep walking towards him? Closer is better with a bow. Right. So you, you felt like you could get closer so you might as well just keep going until you realize that you have to draw. Yeah, he, uh, when he. I'm waiting for them to get broad side because it's an animal that big. Um, you have to, you just have to wait for a good broadside shot. And so here I am arranging them as I walk and now he's getting ready to go broadside. That's an important point, man, because shot placement is something that people that don't understand hunting don't know how difficult it is to not just have a shot on an animal, but have an animal be in position to take the shot.

Speaker 2:          01:35:43       I was watching a television show on guys that were hunting water buffalo with a bow and Arrow and I saw a guy take a frontal shot. So He's, he's, he's not feeding, so I'm not moving because he's. His head's up with this peripheral. He could see me. So he thinks something's going on here. He's not. He probably caught something. I mean his ears covering his eye right there. You've got to be that focused. So I know he's not looking at me right now, but he had, he might've thought he saw something so he just kind of chilling out. June is cut. And how hard is it to stay still here? It's, it's all right. But I need, I need him to go broadside. I need that close leg to go forward because if I just draw back and shoot, you know, without that guaranteed going to be unsuccessful. So I need that, that lady to go forward that close like right here now that opened up his vitals.

Speaker 2:          01:36:33       Boom. Perfect. Right in there. And how far away was that? That was 39 yards. So their, their heart sits a. I mean that you see that blood coming out right now. The heart sits like right next to it. It's, it's, it's fine, right? It's forward. It's forward from an elk would be a little more back. But basically you have to go right through that front leg. And uh, I shot it really heavy Arrow and 90 pounds, that's a 90 pound weight right there. And you can see he's, he's already week, so it's only been, you know, maybe a minute and he's, he's about done. So you have to actually shoot through the leg itself to get to the heart unless he's quartering away from you. Maybe. Yeah, quarter in a way. The problem is they're so big, so if it's too to quartering away their stomachs big and it's full of grass.

Speaker 2:          01:37:24       So that could essentially be like for an Arrow to go all the way through a bunch of grass, wet grass. I mean probably not going to happen. And you're shooting through ribs that are as thick as two by fours, right? So what a crazy animal he's about bled out right here. And, and the thing with a bow, I mean these things fight each other. So he has no idea what happened. I mean, he's just like no clue that he's used to getting jabbed with horns or tree branches or all sorts of stuff. All he knows is he's

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       lost a lot of blood and boom, it's over crazy. Yup. Now you guys, when you went there and you didn't bring any water with you, you have to filter that piss water somehow, right? Yeah. What are you, what do you filter it with? We had a water filter and we had a steripen. What's that? It's just like ultraviolet light. You put in the water, you hit it with the ultraviolet light and then it supposedly disinfected water supposedly is a key world. The only reason why I throw out that is because we filtered it. We stare a pendant, we poured it through a shirt and it still smelled like buffalo pis. Well, it is buffalo pis. We drank paralyzed buffalo pet. We drank it and we didn't die. I saw something online the other day. They were trying to figure out how much of the ocean is whale piss.

Speaker 1:          01:38:47       Like how many? How many whales are there? How long had they been peeing in the ocean? Right. How much of that? Where does it go? How much of the ocean as well pissed and we should protest them doing that. Was dirty, stinky wheels. Yeah. So selfish. I saw a sad thing though, man, where this whale died in. When the, uh, blue whale was beached, they examine the contents of its stomach and it was filled with fishing nets and plastic bags because apparently whales eat a lot of squid and they get confused at that stuff, like plastic bags and things along those lines. And they think that it's food and then they got an intestinal blockage. So it died by being backed up. Yeah. That's a rough way to go. That is too bad. They don't have whale doctors either in the ocean where they go, Hey doc, I'm not feeling so good here.

Speaker 1:          01:39:38       So something's going on. I haven't shaved in a week. I'm going to check you out. Yeah, no, my whale is coming out. Bloody good. The world, the world of harsh nature. We live in that world. We just don't think we do because we've created this super cool thing called cities. Yeah. I don't think it's so cool, but we definitely created it. You're crazy. You're wearing clothes that was created in cities. You're going to watch those creating cities, your, uh, your bow was created in the city. I have a fit band. I don't have that same thing. It doesn't tell you the time. I think it does. Yeah. Come on. It's got to tell you the time it says I got all time. Record seven hours and 49 minutes sleep. Oh, that's an all time record. Well, congratulation recently. Congratulations is in order. It is. That's what happens is you get to stay in a hotel to work that day. Yeah. No, it actually does have the time. Sorry. There you go. So you've got to watch a car that you have to drive around to get to these hunting spots that's all created in a city or you gotta go all this technology created by people in civilization that we're allowed to relax, not worried about being eaten by wolves. And they said, hey, uh, these regular bows that we're using are kind of bullshit. We need some cams and these things, right? Like as

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       you pull it back, it lets off at a certain weight and then it's got more power going forward. And a bunch of engineers went to schools, they wrote things down on paper and uncover all that stuff created in cities. Yeah. So like the city and the transition that some organisms are going through from wild to civilize actually makes it possible for you to exist in the wild world. Again, just like they'll hunting is conservation thing. How ironic is something positive to a city? Is that what you're saying? Oh, 100 percent. One hundred percent. Listen man, I'm not into working at a factory for 16 hours a day making iphones, but if somebody wasn't, I wouldn't have an iphone and I wouldn't be able to tell you that you've got to press that button twice or shut off your apps. I did learn something today like you. We all need each other as awesome.

Speaker 3:          01:41:42       And for a guy like you who is so invested in living in the wild and having this challenge of being in the wild, you need your nice under armour clothes to keep your comfy and warm and drive and you're out there. You've got your under or boots that were made in some sort of a factory and designed by some sort of an engineer and you got your, uh, your watch tells you what altitude you're at, all that stuff is, is a part of your experience in this wild world. You know, you got your gear and you got your sat phone so you could call home, you know, hey, I just shot the biggest pool of my life out here in the wild. I'm talking to you from a fucking satellite under miles in space. But that's one reason why I'm not the greatest when they send me stuff to try out because um, I like being miserable. I'm not the greatest for feedback. So how it perform, I'm like, you like being slightly miserable. Otherwise you'd go out there naked. Right, right. You know, because that's one of the, that's one of the big arguments that the non hunters will use against the hunter. Like, you're a real man. Why don't you go kill the fucking oak with your wounds? Right. Why don't you go out with your hands?

Speaker 3:          01:42:47       Well, that's not the way to do it. Dummy things, because you're not going to kill any of them. You won't kill them. That's not how you killed them. Right? You know, just like a rattle snake doesn't kill you unless it uses poison. Rattlesnake just tried to, if they didn't have any poison and wanting to fight me, are we going to do. You're going to stab me with you. A little stupid needles. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to crush your fucking head with a rock. Stupid because I have an opposable thumb. So after you stabbed me with your needle, that doesn't have any venom in it because you want to play fair. Oh look, I grab you by your head. I smash it with a rock. I wind dummy. Wait, that makes sense though. Dang it. Well, it makes sense because I'm a human being and I come from a long line of human beings and human beings had been thinking and more importantly we've been communicating.

Speaker 3:          01:43:28       We've been communicating with language and uh, we, we remember things that we learned and we pass it on to others. So I think what's going on now, even though it seems negative and it seems weird, and the world of wildlife and hunting and hunters versus people who don't hunt, I think ultimately it all balances out really well because it all balances out in an honest way. There's going to be people that don't agree with things no matter what, just like there's gonna be people that don't agree with a lot of different things that a lot of people think are fun. There's going to be disagreements, but in those disagreements we're going to find arguments that make sense and arguments that don't make sense. We're going to find people that are disingenuous and that are not being totally honest with scientific facts about nutrition, scientific facts about whether or not humans are omnivores or herbivores.

Speaker 3:          01:44:16       Uh, there's a lot of dishonesty because these debates are not debates about facts and reason. There are debates about ideology and they only, they only promote and subscribe to ideas that benefit their ideology. That's it. And you get it on both sides. That's one of the problems with the hunting is conservation hunting's hunting. Yeah. Ben O'brien's. Got It right. Funding to conservation is a byproduct of hunting and hunting. Even if it wasn't conservation, it was just. It was just something you do to eat. It's still. It's still good. Yeah. Yeah. Still good. No. This conversation is important though. Yeah. People will talk to for your hunting. That's a big one man. He goes, dudes. Joseph Toy. You're hooting. Yeah. It's true. Just communication. Yeah. About something that, you know, I read your fucking instagram. Yeah. It's important. It's A. Yeah. I mean that's, I don't, I try not to engage in the, in the negative stuff on that, on instagram, but I do.

Speaker 3:          01:45:17       I do talk about the positive attributes of hunting. I show, you know, skinning out bare. I show my fees, freezer full of meat. I show working hard to be the most effective ethical hunter I can be. So yeah, I try to share all of it. Yeah. But you also have people that back you up. That's kind of interesting that people know that, so you don't have to really engage in a bunch of campaigns. Soldiers out there. Guys, you're fucking instagram page the battlefield whenever you put some animal up, all my goodness, and it's a lot of Europeans ally now it's that they're the most detached because they have the fewest percentage of hundreds over there. Yeah, I mean I always get stuff from over there. They just have no concept or people. Even Brazil, you know, you get just. Brazil's a big one. Yeah, that's a big one.

Speaker 3:          01:46:03       Yeah. A lot of hate from there. Um, yeah. Someone was talking to me about that the other day. Someone was saying like, how many people get upset about it might've been shamed. Was it Shane Dorian? Um, but there's what you, when you hear the Robin Hood Story, like when people think about Robin Hood Robinson and bridge and gives to the poor. What people don't understand is that was originally about food. It was about him being able to hunt on private land that the king owned because people are starving. That was the original story of Robin Hood. It's about Robin Hood going out and shooting these animals and bringing meat back to people. Because in Europe, in a lot of countries you are only able to hunt on private land because there is no public land. We are incredibly lucky in this country in that I was in yellowstone this weekend, told you I went up there and fucking amazing man.

Speaker 3:          01:46:57       What an amazing thing and that's a non hunting thing, right? Yellowstone. You can't hunt there, but this concept of public land, this concept of more than a million acres, I don't know how many millions of acres. Yellowstone is a big, big chunk of property, credible place that they can't build things on. You can't replace it, can't put them all there and it's just wild and natural and it's ours. It's by an act of Congress. Back before they had fucking cars wrap your head around that. They figured out before they had cars, they're like, Yo, we gotta do something about this place. This is too good. Yeah, we can't let anybody corrupt this and this is what was wrong with where we came from, where we came from. Everybody owned all the land. It was all private and no one. You didn't have a place where you could just go backpacking and just camp out.

Speaker 3:          01:47:49       We have all these designated areas, designated areas that are all public land owned by the taxpayers of the United States and whether you appreciate hunting or whether you just appreciate camping or hiking or any of those things. We have a beautiful thing in this country. Whereas the wild world that we're the. The actual beautiful environment of these forests and most of the areas are in a lot of the areas. All the areas designated as public land. They're ours. They're yours there. Jamie's there. Everybody that's listening. All every, all the people that live here and even if even if the listeners aren't gonna hunt, which fine not everybody has to hunt, but I would say get out there to yellowstone or there's some national forest here in California, some great. Just get out there and experience life. You know? I mean because living in the city isn't experiencing life well.

Speaker 3:          01:48:39       It's experiencing life in the city. It's life that's. But it's not. It's almost like you have a TV that only shows three different colors. You get a little bit of red, a little bit of why? A little bit of black. That's it. So you get. Yeah, and you don't know what it looks like if you're watching like Avatar and a beautiful four K tv and you're like all the beautiful magical colors and wow, you've never seen it before. You're experiencing a muted connection with your food and a very muted connection with wildlife that sometimes it's fucking uncomfortable and scary. Yeah. Yeah. But it's also real. It's bulk. Yeah. You know, I've had some, I've had some great hunts. Marble Mountain wilderness up in northern California. Where's that? What part? This is just south of Oregon. Oh yeah. Where were you? What'd you do up there? A deer hunt killed a nice black tail buck. Was it like up there? A mountains dense? Yeah, it's a timber. It's great country. Big, big country. I'm pretty rugged. Yolie, bullied wilderness. Huge area. Whereas that same area, so little little, uh, um, it's near

Speaker 2:          01:49:47       Marble Mountain wilderness. Another giant area. So many bear. There's, you almost seemed more bear than deer up there. Really [inaudible] why is that? I don't know. It's great habitat so you can go up there and you can buy a deer tag and a bear tag when I went there about 160 bucks for, for non state resident or a non resident of California out of state, um, hunter and a, for a resident of California, probably super cheap, you know, um, but great hunting. So you can go up there and hunt deer and hunt bear. Same same time. A camp out. Survive

Speaker 3:          01:50:22       sees the stars and their natural way. Yeah. Yeah. All those things.

Speaker 2:          01:50:26       It opens up a, like Megan mid August.

Speaker 3:          01:50:30       Well, there's just an appreciation for this strange planet when you. You're viewing the lifeforms on it. What does this Jamie picture at marble mountain. Wow. God. Damn. That's beautiful. So pretty. Is that why it's called Marble Mountain? Marble Mountain? It looks like it's made out of marble. Does look like raw marble. Yeah. Is it, is it made out of marble? Is that what the Rock is? People go there to make countertops. They're stealing from the land to make someone's counter. Yeah. But isn't that amazing? It's beautiful. Yeah. Um, when I was in Montana this past week and went to the yellowstone thing, I mean, you just be driving and you would just drive and just look down the street and go, fuck, this is crazy. This place is crazy. This, this view is like, um, it's like a drug, like you're taking in this incredible mountain side covered in trees and the sunlight is hitting the trees and it had just got done raining and everything was a vibrant and green and you're like, this is a drug. Like I'm getting an eyeball drug by staring at this thing. Like it's doing something to me physically. Will you just go, wow. It makes you feel good to see it.

Speaker 2:          01:51:41       Well, when I'm at Marble Mountain Wilderness district, I mean that's public land. Anybody can go there, you can go there anytime you want. And uh, when I'm there, what I feel like when. So if you were at that exact same place that, that Jamie just had a picture of, you feel small, you feel the countries big, you feel insignificant really compared to how grand the country is. And for me personally, for, I think for everybody, it's good, it's good to feel small. Sometimes people elevate themselves, people make themselves more important than they really are. That's a real. I mean, that puts you in check back there because you realize if anything happens back here, does anybody even know. I mean, they'll find out, but I'm just another not too much different than an ant back here. If I die, nothing's going to change. The wind's going still blow. Um, you know, that lions are still going to try to kill deer. The elk are still going to try to breed nothing changes. So it's good. I think it's good to have that feeling every once in a while to realize, know what?

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       I'm not that special. Yes. That's why I love the wilderness. Well, there's an inescapable understanding when you're, you're faced with the enormity of nature is like everything to the left you everything to the right and everything as far as the eye can say. He doesn't give a fuck. And it's all been this way for who knows how long. And it will be this way for who knows how long after you're gone. This is just this life factory and it's all going on all around you and it doesn't care about you. Now you were just an entrance. You're an entrant in this weird sort of a race that's going on where things are trying to get by, things just trying to get by, by eating all the grasses the grasses are trying to get by, by producing some sort of a chemical that discourages these things to eat them.

Speaker 3:          01:53:31       The animals are trying to run from the other animals that are trying to eat them. And, and we're all just hanging out watching or participating but in, you know, in regular life and everybody's so worried about people's feelings and people being, um, fairly treated or people, whatever. And it's just like, it's, it just gets. So I get it. I want, you know, everybody should be treated fairly. But I like when it's just black and white. I like when I'm in the mountains, I don't have to worry about or even think about everybody's cause cause of the day or I don't know. I mean, it's just, it puts it in perspective, it does put it in perspective and I think it would be good for everybody, including people that are really invested in these causes to experience this because I think it broadens your perspective. And again, even if you're just hiking out there, like I said, my, the hunt that made me feel the most thankful was an unsuccessful one.

Speaker 3:          01:54:30       So while we were doing was hiking with guns. So we went hiking with guns for five days in the rain. Yeah. And I came back and I felt so goddamn good. Yeah. And not just good about like the ability to have food, um, to not have to go out and hunt and kill it because we were unsuccessful. But that, this is a, this is a really cool thing that we figured out how to do to escape that world, that world of harsh, brutal nature that the tooth thing and claw world. But you're not going to appreciate that unless you go in there and there. Yeah. That in there though, that's where it gets hard. It's hard to convince people like it's hard to convince fat people to get off the couch, you know? It's hard. It's hard to convince people that it probably would benefit them to be uncomfortable. Yeah, that's. We're addicted to comfort for sure. You're addicted to being uncomfortable. Just makes you real fucking weird. Your captain uncomfortable. That's your new name. That's your podcast name. Oh, captain uncomfortable. So let's talk about that because we're gonna. We're gonna end this soon and we're going to start the first episode of the Cameron Hanes podcasts, but we have to have a name for it. What did we come up with? Keep hammering is a good one.

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       Yeah, I liked that. You know why? Because that's the first thing that I ever heard from you or about you. I might even heard that before I met you. Yeah. And I was like, look at this fucking dude out there working and his, his, his, his constant catchphrases. Keep hammering. It might. Yeah. That's a good thing to think of. If you're thinking about quitting, like if you think about every year even like I'm going to run five miles a day and then that third mile I'm like, fuck, I want to do this, and you just say, God fucking keep hammering. Yeah. I'm going to keep hammering. The mindset of pushing yourself forward is is a good mindset? It's a good mindset to have because God damn comfortable. Soft das water balloon full of blood body wants you to take breaks. Yeah, that bitch ass body does. It's begging for a break bitch ass body.

Speaker 1:          01:56:32       We have. What do you think, Jamie? Keep hammering. Yeah, that's sounds like a great one. Or filthy skills. Filtered skills as confusing though. It's. It's a little inside joke. A little bit. That's why might be better for a shirt. It's like if I call this podcast, let's get lucrative, filthy sluts and go lots of ways. Right? So could be. Could be grossly. People think dirty porn, right? I think filled these skills might be better as a shirt. Okay, so a hanes world, like Wayne's world. Somebody had one. They made a poster right there. I make an online thing, so last week. Yeah, look, but you need a sidekick. Who would you be? Would you be the Mike Myers or would you be the Dana Carvey? Garth. He'd be good. Wayne was Wayne. Wayne, Wayne and Garth was A. Garth was Dana carvey. Yeah. Kinda like garth better. You like garth better than the Wayne lot better.

Speaker 1:          01:57:28       Well that's my boy. I don't have a sidekick though. You know you don't have a sidekick. You just sidekick dude. Who'd we get? We need a. You need a, like someone to argue with you like some vegan sort of nick tooth type character to do battle with. That's a whole different show. I don't know, but I'm just trying to like be in a network. I'm like a negative network network executive. Trying to fuck up your original idea. We need. We need drama. We need a wacky neighbor. You're showing you the gay neighbor who's a Vegan. Who gets mad at you, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It takes your meat out and he throws it out in the outside and it goes bad to punish you for killing animals. Okay, well that's, that's episode one will have to put out a feeler for that. Just plenty of those dudes out there. You can find them. Just go through your instagram comments and pluck them out. You got to get them to come here from Europe though. Yeah, well I know. I know one guy who shared a picture of a bear I killed on on his site and he brought me a lot of hate mail. Maybe he'd be my side kick. There's a lot of those dudes. Yeah, there's a lot of those. A lot of them are like Vegan bodybuilders. Just really interested. That's the guy. Yeah, well there's a bunch of those steroid

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       users. By the way. Steroid users now does anything wrong with steroids, but you motherfuckers on talking about that. I see the size of your muscles. I see your diet and that doesn't make sense to me. You're not taking in enough fat to produce the kind of testosterone that you need to develop those kinds of muscles. You're just not, and you guys are lean as fuck in. Your muscles are massive. I see it. I know what you're doing. You're on dirt roads and by the way, a lot of those steroids aren't the and they require bacteria. They were acquired dead life in order to create. Some of it's vague, they actually make testosterone for wild yams. Hmm. Interesting. Right? I didn't know that. Um, but uh, either way you got this like some hypocritical horseshit going on. There's also a lot of like weird posturing going on.

Speaker 3:          01:59:34       The part of the reason why they're doing it is because they want to appear to be very noble and it's what's called Michael Sherman calls it a virtue. Signaling Schermer is a very famous skeptic and intellectual and uh, he's like, this is what they're doing. Like there was signaling to the people around them, sort of like when an elk bugles is to let all the other elk. No, he's a bad motherfucker. I. Well, by having all these anti hunters, which is a, like you're gonna if you have an anti hunter post, you're absolutely going to have a bunch of people to take your side. Yeah. Fuck those people. Right. But they also get to see how good your six pack looks. So you say fuck those people, but you're also oil down and you're talking about, you know, cruelty free, you know, awesome life and healthy living while you're like overhead pressing a lot of weight, you look sleek and you probably get some pussy that way and that's what these guys are doing.

Speaker 3:          02:00:27       There's a lot of that going on. It's not a coincidence that some of the contest fucks are also some of the ones who are the most into their physiques. Right? I see what you're doing. I know what you're doing. I guarantee you if you got those guys alone with no one watching and he had a conversation with them, they would fall apart. I guarantee you their arguments would fall apart. Their motivations would fall apart if there's no one there to cheer them on or help them. He actually got to see them as a human being. Having a communication with you as a human being about why it is that you're spreading this kind of hate and then you get into the very specifics of this and you realize this argument is long and vast and super complex. You guys are trying to make it look like it's not trying to make it look like you eating that salad. You're the best ever. You're super awesome. Yeah. You're better than us as hunters. Exactly. That's why you're better than people who don't do what you do. Even though you just started doing it four months ago. Exactly.

Speaker 3:          02:01:24       So irritated. Did you see the video of the dude who was a eating a pizza? It's got cheese in it and he fucking freaks out. He's a Vegan and he's talking about how awesome it is to be Vegan and then realizes in the middle of the video that the, the pizza has cheese and sauce with it and he goes ballistic. Yeah. Yeah, because there's a long video. Oh, and it's just. He throws his phone. He screamed and yelled. He's so angry. And in the, in the video he's talking about like, you can't say that you're a good person if you're not vegan. You can't say that you're a person who tries to be a good person. Well, if that's the case, why aren't you Vegan?

Speaker 3:          02:02:03       Like, boy. Well, you fucking nailed it. You made it so simple. Yeah. Well his mom ordered the pizza, so it was just a misunderstanding. It's very hilarious, but this is a guy. It's like we'd have to play this band done. Oh No, I don't want to shit on this guy. You can go find it if you want folks. I don't want to play it or shit on this guy. He's just a young kid. He's got his ideas and maybe in his mind he's right, but I just found the folly and watching him freak out over some cheese. I get it. Cows or look, man, if you want something to be upset about rather than hunters, it is absolutely the fucking dairy industry and agricultural gag laws. These AG gag lungs that don't allow you to film these chicken factories where these things are stuffed into these horrible conditions or pig factories or factory farming.

Speaker 3:          02:02:53       I'm 100 percent with you. I think it is one of the worst aspects of civilization. The way we acquire our protein and here's, here's another real problem and a contradiction and for guys like you and I, we don't really have an argument against this. Not Everybody can hunt and if you want to eat meat and you want to do it in an ethical way, you you have a real dilemma that they are pointing out. I think that by point, by going against hunters though, they're, they're missing. They're missing the mark in a big, big, big way. You're missing the mark in a giant wet. We're not the enemy. No, definitely. But I mean if you do want to eat me and you, you don't hunt, there are place. I mean my buddy Adam La Roche owns a three ranch and that's a free range. Yeah, you can do it.

Speaker 3:          02:03:37       It can be done, but it's expensive and you're not going to get it at Mcdonald's and it's. If you want a quick cheeseburger and you want to pull into that Wendy's drive through, boy, you got to put those fucking those ethical blinders on. Yeah. You have to. Yup. And they're in that sense. Take a break from ethics that day. Yep. And in that sense, all these vegans are right in that sense when they're talking about how animals are being treated, where we're getting our milk from and our cheese from it. And in most of these large scale factories, they're there, right? They're 100 percent right? And I'm with him. I just think that this whole conversation is really about human beings and civilization itself and our ability to diffuse responsibility, our ability to detach ourselves and just like we're talking about these people that consume grain and don't think about the consequences of life.

Speaker 3:          02:04:29       These people that consume all sorts of vegetables that are used, that pesticides are used, that are killing off bs. This is a huge issue that you contribute to. I do all, all the, all the people that we know that eat fruits and vegetables most likely having some way contributed to the large scale death of a lot of different insects and animals is just a part of being a person. And you can't deny that. If you try to deny that and say, well, I'm trying to do the least harm possible. That's great. That's like trying to say like, I'm a serial killer, but I only like to kill once a month. I got this fucking guy argued with me and one of the things he was arguing, he's guy, I'm 90 percent vegetarian.

Speaker 1:          02:05:07       Oh, what does that me, it's fucking ridiculous. But that's the same thing. That's the same thing as saying you're a Vegan. I am to six hours and I'm sleeping total vegetarian. So what is that? That's 25 percent. Yeah. You're not eating at all during that time? No. You're an Eriterian, right? So I'm like, I'm better than him, but if you can, if you contributing to death, then you really can't say anything and everyone's contributing to death. If you live in a house, if your house was made out of wood, if trees were fell to build your house, animals died.

Speaker 3:          02:05:41       Do you know what Michael p dot? Absolutely. And their habitat was displaced. And do you know what Michael Pollan says? He's the guy who wrote that book, the Omnivore's dilemma. Very, very fascinating guy. He said that they have done research where they have played the sound of animals eating leaves and plants next to plants and somehow or another the very sound of those animals eating plants causes the plants to excrete defensive chemicals. So somehow or another, these plants, they're not just feeling that someone's eating them, they are hearing it and they're aware and they're reacting to sound. And so I'm sort of a strange way that is commensurate with the way an animal reacts to danger in some sort of a strange way. He also says that they produce some human neurochemistry chemicals like Serotonin and dopamine. They, they produce commensurate chemicals and we don't know why. We don't know what's going on. Then. Crazy fucking nuts, nuts. Um, I had to read it like three or four times. I'm like, wait a minute. They played sounds of animals eating plants next to the plants and the plants are.

Speaker 1:          02:06:53       That's actually a pretty barbaric to do that. It's rude. Yeah. Either one,

Speaker 3:          02:06:58       don't eat them. Don't torture them. First it's like, you know, you wouldn't kill cows, but before you kill them, you play this horrible sound.

Speaker 1:          02:07:05       Yeah. Other cows getting killed? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:07:09       The bad news for Vegetarians, plants can hear themselves being eaten and become defensive. When attached attacked researchers from the University of Missouri found plants respond to attack. They discovered that the sound of caterpillars eating made them more defensive and plants that heard caterpillar sounds released more mustard oils which are unappealing to caterpillars and thus ward them off. Wow, wow. But plants that heard the wind, despite having similar acoustic sound, knew not to waste their defensive capabilities. Although this suggests that plants are able to identify sounds in their environment. That makes sense, man. Most people don't give it a second thought when they're tucking into a plate of salad, but perhaps we should be a bit more considerate when chomping on lettuce. Now, scientists have found that plants actually respond defensively. You just need to accept the fact that life eats life. Life eats life is to it. Well, that doesn't allow you to be sanctimonious or, or to take the moral high ground.

Speaker 3:          02:08:05       So I'm going to have to say you're full of shit in a piece of fucking human garbage and you're out there raping the world with your filthy skills. By the way, you can get this filthy skills, tee skills with a z. like the young kids are doing these crazy kids. Cameron hanes.com. Right? That's it. That's it. Free Shipping. Felt skills. Bitches. All right, we're going to come back in this time. Cam's going to do all the talking because I can't, I can't. I can't shut the fuck up too much coffee. And uh, we're going to come back with a cameron hanes podcast at. Won't be on Youtube. Maybe he'll eventually get it set up where it's going to be on youtube, but I'll tweet it, he'll tweet it, will put it on facebook and everything like that. And you'll be able to download that shit. Friends and neighbors campaigns. I love you buddy. You're awesome. Thank you. Alright. See you people.
