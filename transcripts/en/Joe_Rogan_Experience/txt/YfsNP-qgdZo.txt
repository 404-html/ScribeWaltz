Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey everybody that sound in the back is not me going to the bathroom. That's just pouring coffee. Folks. Don't get crazy. This episode of the podcast is brought to you by a new sponsor. It's called blue apron and blue apron. Uh, I just, I'm just try this out. This week they sent it to me. This is what blue apron is. It's a way to get all the ingredients for healthy meals along with recipes shipped to your house. It's pretty interesting. Um, I was a bit skeptical at first. It was like, what, what exactly they're going to do and then they send you this thing. It's got this sheet, it's got photographs of what everything looks like, shows you how to cook everything. All the meals are between 500 and 700 calories per serving. A really interesting way to low calories, low for how delicious they are.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       It's all healthy, excellent food and it's all stuff that you don't have to go to a store, you don't have to going where they'll ship everything to you. It's all like in these coolers that have like, I guess it's freeze dried or something like not freeze dried. What's that stuff called? Dry Eyes. Dry Eyes to keep it cold, but it, uh, it sat inside my house for like 10 hours and it was still nice and cold when I opened it up and put it in the frigerator. Um, they have all kinds of yummy stuff. They have the step by step instructions were said, which picture with pictures, totally idiot proof. They work around your schedule and your dietary preferences and the cooking takes about a half an hour. Shipping is completely free and you can make meals like short rib burgers on Pretzel Buns, Kung Pao chicken tacos, very delicious stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       You Cook incredible meals and you can be blown away by the quality and the freshness. Blue Apron, it's fast, it's fresh and it's affordable to end the stress of cooking. Now go to blue apron.com/Rogan and get your first two meals free. That's right. First two meals free. Blue Apron.com/Rogan is really interesting idea. I've never heard anything like this before and like I said, I was kind of like a bit skeptical, but the meals are delicious. Last night I had had some, I forgot the name of the Tacos, but it was a steak Taco, but they all the spices they give you like onions, garlic, all these different things that chop up was really kinda cool. Uh, so blue apron.com/Rogan. And get your first two meals free. I'm using it right now and as I use it I will update you guys on all the new ingredients and new, different things that I try out.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       So I'll keep you updated. But so far so good. I love it. Blue Apron.com/Rogan. Go there and get your first two meals free. We're also brought to you by ting and if you go to Rogan.ting.com, you can get in on what is going to be the future of cell phone purchasing and cell phone use in my opinion with Ting does is they, they rent the sprint backbone so it's just like having sprint phone except you have no contracts. You have no early termination fees, no add ons, no bs, no weird hidden payments that you have to do to deal with. Most of the time when you buy a cell phone, if you buy a cell phone and the cell phone says it costs $200, it's not really $200, most likely it's probably quite a bit more, but what they do is they defer that money over the course of the term of your contract, so the phone might really cost $600 bucks.

Speaker 1:          00:03:25       So for the next three years that you're under contract, you're slowly paying off that phone. You don't realize that. So when you go to try to cancel your contract, you owe them a bunch of money and it's kind of annoying. It's also annoying the way they have it set up at most cell phone companies. Accepting this is the only one I know of that does it differently. Ting has it setup where you only pay for what you use. Like say if you have like 120 minutes a month plan, most of the time you're not going to use all that. And what happens when you don't use it? Nothing. You don't get any money back. If you use more, you pay more, they get you a fee. But if you use less, you do not get paid. You don't get that money back with Ting, you only pay for what you use.

Speaker 1:          00:04:07       It's an awesome company. I really love doing business with them because first of all, they're completely, totally ethical there. They're also very generous. When Tim had its two year anniversary for no reason whatsoever, other than the fact that they wanted to, they decided to cut rates on slash rates on their data, which really affected heavy users. Especially 98 percent of people would save money with Tim and that is because they do mobile differently. Go to [inaudible] dot ting.com for more details. They have all the new and greatest android phones available, including the iphone five. You can get the iphone five for 260 bucks. That's ridiculous folks. It's cheap. It's easy. It's awesome. And they have been a sponsor of the podcast for a long time. So if you were in the market for a new cell phone, please give them a try. They support us and we support them. Rogan.ting.com. Go there and save 25 bucks off of a new cell phone then. That's it for now. But let's just get cracking. We got a lot of interesting stuff to talk about. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a very special guest. Cue The music Camp Jamie and I'll introduce him to the world,

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       the Joe Rogan experience

Speaker 2:          00:05:18       Joe Rogan podcast. We have.

Speaker 1:          00:05:25       Is it okay to call you the Godfather? Please do the godfather here. Ladies and gentlemen, and this is in reference to a music video that you were a part of. God. How do I say your last name? Sat. Just sat. That's fine. Cad side. It's two a's. It gets tricky when this next phase because it's a guttural sound from Arabic. Oh, how will you say it? Side side. But since most westerners couldn't pronounce that, you just do the AA. Oh, that's got to be annoying. That's where this. We're like, we gentrify everything.

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       We push everything down. And uh, you are, you are an expert in evolutionary psychology and in this is where rick, it's really fascinating evolutionary psychology and its effect on consumerism, right? So I basically apply a evolutionary psychology on this time that are consumed with Tori nature. What are the biological forces that can pedal us to be the consumers that we are defined consumption very broadly. It's not just consuming Coca Cola, but we consume friendships, we consume religion, we consume marriages. So it's a consumption with a capital c. that's fascinating to me because you know, we have these general definitions that we use in, in, in culture. And one of them is consumerism. Consumerism almost always pertains to buying things, but what you're looking at it. And as I like that better because it is kind of what we do. We do consume relationships. Don't want exactly.

Speaker 3:          00:06:54       I mean we consume cultural products, right? So why is it that certain songs are so appealing to us? I mean, what, what are, what is it about song lyrics that are, that trigger an emotional pull us why our movies appealing? Well, you study these sculptural products because they say something really about the evolution of the human mind that's do you study songs that are annoying as well because I've always wondered why some songs are like super appealing to some, but then just infuriating to other people. So that would probably be a musicologist who would study the, the musical structure of songs to know what makes them appealing or not. I'm specifically looking at the lyrics. So for example, if you look at hip hop videos, they're wonderful Darwinian laboratory because all the political correctness is cut out and basically your real Darwinian being shines through, right?

Speaker 3:          00:07:43       So men are going to signal, Hey, I've got the Missouri Audi, I've got the Porsche, get with me. Uh, women are going to signal, you know, beauty markers. It's only women, for example, who denigrate men if they have low social status, right? It's never going to be a guy saying, Hey Linda, you, you don't work hard enough so you're not ambitious enough. I'm not going to have sex with you. But the other way around you see a million songs like that, right? Yeah, yeah. All you know, like she, she's not a gold digger, but yeah, that's very interesting. I'm a musicologist. Is that a real person? A real person? Yes. That's a musicologist would study lyrics and dope and. Well they would probably study that. The structure structure of the musical notes. Right? So what, for example, what is it? That's what types of notes are innately appealing to people.

Speaker 3:          00:08:32       Uh, so that, that's certainly not what I do. I'm, I'm looking only at song lyrics as one of many types of cultural products. The lyrics would be the thing that would be annoying to most though. I mean that would be the thing that would really try them out as being annoying. Like some inane, retarded songs. They love Taylor swift. What you said it, not me. How dare you, how dare you suffered? I know one thing, if you date Terrell's swift, you're a fucking idiot because that shit will write songs about you for the end of time. She's got whole books about John Mayer. Is that his name? Aaron Meyer. I always say it wrong. John Mayer chicks copy books on that. So that's unfair. Imagine that. Um, so your, your thing would be more along the lines of studying, like why people are, why they find it appealing, like the rap type song, why they find it appealing like Taylor swift, the contents of those songs, if you take a, a ancient Greek poem, right?

Speaker 3:          00:09:33       We still studied at university today, 3000 years later, precisely because that poem is going to speak to certain realities, sibling rivalry, status, competition, parental conflicts with, with their offspring, a paternal uncertainty. All of these factors as what makes literature interesting. So we could study those ancient Greek poems today and still address updates with us precisely because they are speaking about some universal truths. That is amazing, isn't it? That stuff from 3,300 plus years ago is still studied on a daily basis, but some books from like 50 years ago gone. Yeah. That's got to be frustrating as hell. If you're a writer, if you're an author and you're just like, what? That guy is so overrated. I'm so tired of Ealing hearing about, you know, aristotle, aristotle, go fuck yourself, bro. That shit was so long ago. You didn't know anything or they knew a lot. They didn't know a lot of.

Speaker 3:          00:10:32       Certainly knew the mysteries of human nature. I'm fascinated by that. I am absolutely fascinated by what was going on thousands and thousands of years ago and like what was the mindset and communication with those people and you can kind of pull a little bit of it out of the writing, but man, if I could go back in time to some. I mean it would have to be a culture obviously that speaks English where it could understand what they're saying, but I think that would be incredibly fascinating to go back three or 4,000 years ago and communicate with people. Just try to figure out how they see the world. Absolutely. You know, a lot of people are very stuck on identifying cultural differences. Right? So the French eat this type of food, the Malaysians do this type of dance and. But what they miss is that underneath all of these important cross cultural differences is this bedrock of human universals that make us a lot more similar than different from one another.

Speaker 3:          00:11:23       And especially in the social sciences where people are really focused on just identifying differences, differences, differences, but of course there are also things that are so common so that, for example, beauty markets, there are certain beauty markers that if I went to the Yanomami tribe in the Amazon, they're going to find exactly the same things, attractive and the beautiful girls in rap videos as you and I would. And that's because those beauty markers are evolutionary markers and so yes, culture matters. Nobody denies the fact that the culture important, but underneath these cultural differences is a biological, biological heritage that makes you and I are very similar to one another. What, what changes over time that makes beauty markers differently? Like I've always been fascinated, but like if you look at the renaissance paintings, the women were very. You wouldn't, you can't even call them voluptuous there.

Speaker 3:          00:12:10       They're overweight. Ruben Ruben asked like they eat a lot of Ruben's. What is she even asked me? Well, it's rubin was a painter who was particularly had a pension for drawing these voluptuous women who was a fatty chaser. It was a bit of a fatty chase. Ruined that. I must say this is the first time that I've held an interview where fatty chaser has come up, so thank you. Well, you need to be involved in more podcasting because fatty taste. It's important to say now that you're fat shaming, that's the newest thing. Do you follow these ultra super sensitive terms and their evolution? You said we've got up to three hours. I could talk about this for about 30 hours. Poly. I actually went recently to a and we come back. We'll come back to the rubin, so we'll come back to that. I recently gave a talk at Wellesley College, all women's college women's college data chicken went there.

Speaker 3:          00:12:59       Is that right? Times are rough. Tough time. It. Taylor swift. No, it was a gal who did not shave her legs because it was patriarchal to beautify yourself there. Yeah, she can pull it off. She was blonde, but whoa. Her roommate was a Hobbit, showed hairy feet old thing, but hey, you know, whatever. It's just cultural norms. That's it. So anyways, I give a talk there under this thing called the freedom project, which tries to promote sort of iconic, classic ideas that kind of break the shackles of political correctness and uh, it was just amazing that kind of stuff that was happening there. I mean I'll just give you one or two examples. A, apparently it was a form of oppression to assume for a professor to assume that when he meets students he right away categorizes them as either being male or female. So for example, if I see you in my class and I say, Hey sir, while the law, well that would be a form of oppression because I'm assuming based on your outer markers that you are male rather than what I should do is sort of do a quick polling of each person in terms of how they'd like to be addressed.

Speaker 3:          00:14:11       So you may be biologically male but you are a gender, whatever, transgender, you'd be queer, it can be queer, you can be this. So as you know, facebook has 50 markers, the 50, there's 55, zero, zero. I could only, I could 10, right? Wow. Fifty 50. And for folks who don't know, queer is not a slur. When I'm saying Queer, I'm like, Hey, I'm not saying it like that. Queer is, they do not want to be interpreted as male or female. They want to be just whatever they are. Right? And so now you have at universities of discussion as to whether you should have not male and female bathrooms, but you should have gender neutral bathrooms. Uh, and so on and so forth. And so on. Academia and the world that I reside in, it's, it's, it's there. Why is it getting so squirrely? What's going on?

Speaker 3:          00:15:04       Are we too soft? Do we have to hunt for our own food? Do we have to deal with the winter more? Do we have to like chop wood to keep warm? What is making us concentrate on these frivolous matters of like, it's not just a politically correct thing, it's like it's coddling the most ridiculously over-sensitive notions that human beings have ever constructed. I think we've been parameterized by an astonishing farm of political correctness. I mean what [inaudible] like, like a parasite that. Oh, right. So in the same way that I like that word, that viruses can enter your body, a virus, he's of the mind can also take over your, your. I mean religion is an example of a Mima plex form of. I mean some people would be upset by what I'm saying, but a form of parasite that kind of rewires your thinking. So political correctness is a, an astonishing form of parasitic thinking where everything is viewed through the lens of I should not offend anyone and so common sense and just reason goes out the window and the pursuit of non offense.

Speaker 3:          00:16:08       You know what though I have an issue with it, that most people who practice this in the extreme form, they say that they should not offend, but you know who they offend, they offend anyone who does not agree with their notion that you should not offend. They will be violent and angry and fucking incredibly insulting to people who do not agree with their, their, their terms of what is a fence and what's not offensive. I have been some of the Ma, meanest, nastiest things had been said to me by people who claim to be a in this sort of ultra sensitive super open minded category, which is quite fascinating to me that you're exactly right. I'll give you a fantastic quote. I might be paraphrasing. It's like that. I think it's Thomas Soul A. I'm an economist who basically was criticizing so-called diversity, so. Right, so at American universities or in western universities, everybody talks about diversity, but the only form of diversity that's not allowed is intellectual and political diversity.

Speaker 3:          00:17:07       Right? So, so you want. We want diversity in terms of skin color. We wanted diversity in terms of sexual orientation. We want diversity in terms of genders. Right? So all forms of diversity are welcome, but don't you dare step out of line with the accepted politically correct positions. Now that's diversity that we don't want. Yeah. What is that? What? I mean, how do they not see that thought? Police? Yeah, and I face it. I mean eventually I guess we'll come back to my work. I face it very much in my work because I, I, I rile up all sorts of different people out of the woods, the woodwork. So for example, radical feminists hate my work because how dare you say that we are biological beings? How dare you say that there are sex differences. A postmodernist will hate my work because the truth is all relative.

Speaker 3:          00:17:51       There's no such thing as scientific truth. It's all relative. Uh, the religious folks will hate my work because if Darwinian theory is correct, it is a then where is God in all this? So there's this long queue of people who will come out of the woodworks to criticize you. Not for any valid scientific reasons, but because they, it, it shakes their ideological beliefs. It's fascinating to me the parallels between religious nutters and politically correct nutters because it's very similar in a lot of ways that their ideology is just so cemented in their consciousness. More bile. It's rock solid. It's not going anywhere. If you disagree, you patriarchal piece of shit, you know, male fucking suppressor, you horrible thing. It's, it's quite fascinating if, if, if there aren't, not, if they're not differences, any differences in the sexist, what do they use these radical feminists, what do they use to define the reason why humans have such varying behavior between the male and female gender?

Speaker 3:          00:18:49       Are you ready for this? Everything. Short of genitalia is a social construction, right? So even for example, the fact that Baba grew up to be a, a block center for the University of Oklahoma, and hence he could bench press 500 pounds. That's not due to, for example, any physiological reasons that he is so strong. It's because what happened is his parents, uh, aggressively nurtured rough tumble play. Whereas for girls, they told them, listen to them that you should not be playing so rough and that then either gives the green light or the red light to express your physicality. That's insane. That's absolutely insane that that idea is insane. That there's not a difference in the physiological properties of the bodies of men and women. I mean the biological differences are scientific. While they are there. There are some feminists and I, again, I'm paraphrasing the quote, they'll say there's no such thing as a male or female brain as there is no such thing as a male or female pancreas or liver.

Speaker 3:          00:19:53       Right? So, so the Oregon that defines your personhood is actually gender neutral. Now, that is astonishing because we are a sexually reproducing species, so one of the foundational tenants on which biological understanding happens is that we have two types of polymorphisms. If you'd like to type, we have a male and a female so that we could sexually reproduce. So the idea that much of this as social reconstruction, this social construction is just laughable. I think it comes though, I mean just to be fair to them, I think it originally comes from a desire to fight sex, institutionalized sexism, but what happens is that they mix equality under the law as being indistinguishable beings, right? We we could be different beings yet we should be equal under the law, but they argued that if you admit to the fact that we are different than that makes it easier for the status

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       quo, sexist, patriarchy to maintain it's privileged position and so they create this edifice of the past 50 to 100 years of social science research that is completely laughable, but that they hang onto like religious beliefs.

Speaker 1:          00:21:02       It's so fascinating. There was a woman that has a video online on youtube where she claimed that there is no difference in the physical strength of men and women and it's just that men have been encouraged to engage in weightlifting and all these different things that women did the same thing. They'd be just as strong. That is insane. It's so insane. Have 10 times more testosterone than women. Is that a social construction? Well, it's also insane because women who are athletes, women who are elite world class athletes, if they compare their hand strength to men who don't even exercise, men are stronger. Just the ability to grab things and grip things. Right. There was an issue where there was a woman who is a transgender, she became a transgender woman and she used to be a man. She was a man for 30 years and then she didn't tell anybody, start fighting women and women's mma and I was furious.

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       I went crazy about it and I got so much hate from people that were calling me transphobic because you're transforming and I'm like, that's amazing. Like you don't understand. There's a difference in the male frame. There's a difference in the shape of the hips, the dye, the mechanics of the short, like everything. The whole body is built different and not only that, the fact that it takes 30 years, like you're 30 years of being a man with full testosterone and then it takes like 10 years before your bone density even starts decreasing, but they wanted to make it so it's completely indistinguishable and they also have support from transgender surgeons, which is quite fascinating and completely biased. These transgender surgeons who want to or reassignment doctors and they want to pretend that their exact equals physiologically. I got.

Speaker 4:          00:22:38       Sorry on that. So in my first book I talk about John Money, who was a very famous psychologist at Johns Hopkins, really around maybe the fifties to seventies. He was a big gender theorists who basically argued that everything is due to socialization so that when surgeons would go see him because they had to do gender reassignment either, for example, let's say at a circumcision, you in the rare case where you botch the circumcision and now you have a problem in terms of having a functioning penis or if you have, for example, a condition, a micro penis where you're unlikely to be a functioning mail when you grow up, while he would say don't worry about it, just have the surgery, put a dress on the kid and raised him as a girl and they'd be absolutely no problem. And of course the reality is that that's not how biological sex is determined. And the most famous cases, David Reimer, who was one of his patients who after having gone through the treatment, committed suicide.

Speaker 1:          00:23:34       Yeah, I remember that case. So it was a fascinating story. The, um, the reality of, of what you said, one of the more fascinating aspects of it is the difference between us all being equal as human beings and being the same because we are not, we're not equal, we are very different, but we all should be equal as far as our rights. Right. You know, as far as how we're treated by each other and the law and what a person can get away with. You know, what, what keeps our society civil and kind. Yeah. Those, that we should all have equality including children and old people and everyone. Everyone should have equality in that, in that aspect. That's what, what makes a civilized caring society, but the idea that there's no differences as far as the other thing that we are equal as far as like physical strength or as equal as far as like our wants and desires and needs.

Speaker 1:          00:24:26       That's, that's denying hundreds of years of literature of the struggle, the struggle in all cultures between the male trying to understand the female, the female trying to understand the male were completely alien to each other. We exist amongst each other when we gather information over a long period of time, but then we say ridiculous things like here's one of the things that people love to say, happy wife, happy life, right? Why is that? Because make her happy and she'll stop screaming at you. Don't understand her. Just make her happy, do whatever she wants, and then she'll calm down and you'll be good. But believe me, you can't just be yourself. You can't just be what you want to be and do what you want to do because that's going to drive her fucking crazy because you want to have sex with 100 women who want to drive 50,000 miles an hour. You want to disappear for weeks at a time. I

Speaker 4:          00:25:16       thought by the Patriarchy you had been given the. I've been brainwashed, brainwashed by the, by the way, speaking of sexual variety, which is kind of a central issue in evolutionary psychology. Uh, you should see some of the hate mail I get when I state something has been out. As you know, men would have evolved a greater pension for sexual variety for terribly trivial reasons. To explain, right? I mean women have a think called greater parental investment, right? Women on average have from from there, when the he start to, when they have menopause, 400 x 400 x, so it's a scarce resource. Men and one ejaculation have 250 spermatozoa, so our gametes are very cheap and abundant, and then of course you add the cost of gestation, right? But the likelihood of having mortality when you were giving birth. So for all these reasons, women have much greater minimal parental obligations.

Speaker 4:          00:26:10       Therefore evolutionary theory would predict that they would be much more judicious when they're making a choice because if they make a poor mate choice, that looms much larger for them. That on the other hand, for men, the costs of making a poor mate choice are not as great, but the benefits of having multiple meeting opportunities are quite beneficial and therefore that's why on average you expect men to have a much greater pension for sexual variety. Now that's been documented in 17 trillion different ways and yet you still have people that will send you hate mail saying, Mike, God, are you a pig? How could you promulgate

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       this garbage will you? I think when you're looking at human beings and you're talking about these, these variables, you're looking at it as objectively and scientifically as possible. When people want that concrete world that we've discussed this political correct concrete world politically correct, they have this resistance to looking at it in any way other than the way that they have. It's completely non scientific and that's why it's religious, right? Absolutely, and that's actually one of the criticisms that you often get about evolutionary psychology. People think that you are trying to justify behaviors. For example, if you explain why people are likely to cheat and they're on their monogamous unions, then they say, oh, well you're. You're offering father to why people should do it out. Of course, my rebuttal is I'm. I'm certainly doing no such thing. Similar to how an oncologist studies cancer. He's not justifying counselor.

Speaker 3:          00:27:40       He's not for cancer. He's right. He, he just explains he or she explains cancer and so I don't have a moral position, right? I don't come to the table when I'm doing my scientific research hoping for one thing or another. The data speaks for itself, but again, the ideologues will say no, but if this forbidden knowledge gets out, it makes it easier for people to justify this behavior or that behavior. It's absolutely fascinating to me how human beings react and act and so this subject is quite near and dear to my heart. I love it. I just, I'm. I'm fascinated by the cast of it all. I love watching people flail and scream and get angry about whether it's religious anger, like people who are like legitimately Christian, like I love the God hates fags people, the Westboro baptist. I don't love them. I love everybody.

Speaker 3:          00:28:32       In one way I would like everybody to be nice, but I love the fact that they exist because I'm absolutely fascinated by their folly. I'm absolutely fascinated by this idea that they have in their head that's so concrete that they believe that soldiers are dying because men are being allowed to marry other men. It's unbelievably weird, but compelling to me and in, in, in an equal way. The idea that you saying that there is some sort of an invested commitment that a woman has an a man does not have objectively just looking at us as a biological reproducing species that you had experienced hate because of that. As a scientist, as a person, just analyzing data. I'm amazed and I'm fascinated. I'm just drawn into it. I can't help myself. You want to talk about some religious stuff? Sure. Uh, well, uh, you know, I was born in Lebanon, uh, were Lebanese Jews. Uh, although I'm, I'm a non believing Jewish guy. How dare you. I know, I know you believe in some things. Tell you what I believe it's science and truth and uh, and so we escaped Lebanon actually during the civil war. My parents in 80 were kidnapped

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       by father, the very peaceful because, you know, it's all peaceful. Uh, and uh, and then after that we, we've never gone back to Lebanon and so I, from a very young age, I think I already had sort of the innate pension to question religious belief, which certainly created fiction within my family because you should just believe in shut up, right. But then when I saw the, the, the hatred that religion in genders firsthand, right? I mean facing execution as we were trying to escape Lebanon and then coming to the west, I think I became that much more forceful in my convictions to, to, to, to try to combat religious dogma and of course some of the biggest hate mail that you get this when you do that. And I've even had real professional situations where I've, I've lost professionally because of my position is actually here in California.

Speaker 4:          00:30:34       I've had several schools who otherwise were very, very interested in making me very, very lucrative offers who after maybe doing a bit of due diligence on me and seeing that I'd written stuff that was critical of religion. Suddenly I became persona non grata. Really? Really? That's fascinating. I wouldn't think that there'll will be the case as far as they are. They're even schools in southern California that won't, and they do this legally because they are religiously founded institution. If you're not the seventh, seventh day adventists, we can grant you tenure it. There's another school that had a god squad whereby you go up in front of the Gospel. I mean, that's literally their term where, uh, you have to sort of show that you're accepting Jesus in your heart. And I remember when I school, that's a school college, very, very prominent school. Please. Then it though.

Speaker 4:          00:31:24       Can you write it rhymes with Layola Marymount? No, it's not, but it's within that general area. Uh, there's another school three years ago who was going to make me a huge, huge offer in Orange County that didn't work out now to the person who wanted me to appear in front of the God squad. This was several years ago when I was at UC Irvine. I told him, you do realize that I am a atheist. Lebanese Jew. Evolution is so it's going to be. It's going to be a while before I accept Jesus in my heart and it his answer was, well, no, but don't worry. We'll, we'll coach you as to, as to what to say. Oh, so that's a euphemism for lying, right? How's that fit with the whole real? So you know, this is right here in 21st century, southern California in academia, you know, you better hold certain religious beliefs, otherwise we'll punish you. Jew. Boy, that's amazing. And that's some colleges and then or some universities and the universities to complete opposite. If you're not an atheist, I'm sure that you'd take a lot of slash true at other universities or in academia in general, it is quite a progressive to criticize certainly Christianity, right? Because you're seen as a progressive guy who doesn't buy into all this brunch aid, superstitions, but there is one religion that

Speaker 1:          00:32:46       Islam, she Islamophobia. Isn't that fascinating? I love that. This is same ultra progressives that would give you a million different ways to address someone based on whatever gender they identify with or you know, whatever the fuck else. Weird ultra super sensitive thing. I find that completely fascinating. This Islamophobia thing you find, there's several websites that I frequent just to freak myself out, and uh, the, the super sensitive ones on a regular basis, we'll go over this Islamophobia. Well, because

Speaker 4:          00:33:21       it's, it's, uh, it's, it's actually a very astute way to, to have intellectual warfare. You're actually saying that people who are concerned about particular aspects of this ideology are crazy, right? They suffer from a phobia, so you are denigrating them at their core. You must be nuts to actually fear this. And actually the term started as you may or may not know, it started with the Muslim Brotherhood, a very smart strategy where they knew that the west is very open to being tolerant and so on. And so they kind of piggybacked on that. And so in academia you just never criticized that one I got. Now that's very dangerous because in a, in a sane world, all beliefs should be open to criticism.

Speaker 1:          00:34:05       Absolutely. And not only that, how about the one that is responsible for most of the suicide bombing? Some of phobic. I am Islamophobia. Set it. I'm Islamophobia, Juha phobic. I'm Catholic, a phobic Christian of phobic. I'm afraid of all of your reason. Fillic you love the reason that I do. Well, I, I was raised a Catholic for a very short amount of time and uh, I got very lucky. I had a very tumultuous childhood and when I was in first grade my parents put me in Catholic school and up until then I was obviously don't remember much of this because it was, but I was very religious and it was because my parents were divorcing and there was a lot of violence in the household and I have this idea in my head that somehow or another God was the right way and everybody else was wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:34:53       Going to Catholic school cured me of that entirely. The nun that I had, sister Mary Josephine, I don't remember much about being six years old, but I remember that bitch. She, she was very important to me. She, she really straightened me out because I realized that she has no connection whatsoever to anything holy or majestic. She represented and she, she showed all of the horrors of humanity. Meanness, evilness, being nasty to children, fearmongering and this, this is ailia killed everything. All the above. It was just, it was nothing, nothing holy about it. It was pretty obvious pretty quickly that it was all bullshit. So I was cured from one year of Catholic school. I told my parents was gonna run away from home if they tried to put me in second grade. Wow. Yeah. I was like, I'm done. Like you don't understand what it's like.

Speaker 1:          00:35:47       I went from, you know, being around my mother was this great person, sweet my grandparents, or great to all of a sudden, you know, I didn't go to kindergarten. I just went to first grade. It was my first year in school to being round these monsters and this monster school that was just filled with darkness. It was like the whole school was just dark. All the priests, the, I remember their faces, they all had these gin blossoms all over their faces from drinking, you know, and the nuns were all overweight and bitter and angry and they're fucking skin was having a bad relationship with their face. It was like hanging off of them. Everything about them was just monstrous. That evilness. I'm keeping accounts that have the amount of hate mail that's to comfortable with come bitches. Let it come. I'll just send it right back to you.

Speaker 1:          00:36:31       I don't get it. I don't get it. You know I. I'm fascinated by it, but I understand that people need that. They have this desire to believe in things. I understand that, but I don't understand how you can be a rational, intelligent, objective person who looks at some shit that people wrote thousands of years ago and say, no, this is. This is immobile. This is exactly it's. You cannot alter it. This is what it is and this is. This is written in stone. This is. There's no way around this. This is God's word. Anybody questions that as a full.

Speaker 4:          00:37:05       I do, and in my one of my latest books, I have a chapter which I think got me in trouble with one of the southern California schools that I was getting enough from it because I've given them a signed copy of that book and then they probably got to that chapter. It's called that chapter's called marketing hope by selling lies. And so what I do in that chapter, as I go through different hope Adler's of which religion is the greatest, but others will be medical quackery, self help, gurus and so on. So, so different agents that peddle hope, and I argue again from an evolutionary perspective because they, they're very successful because they cater to these very basil, Darwinian insecurities. None greater than the very obvious one of existential angst, right? We're the only animal that we're aware of that actually is aware that we are on a death sentence, right?

Speaker 4:          00:37:52       I mean, I know that I've got another thing, luckily maybe 40 years, right? Well, if I have high cholesterol, I go to my physician, he gives me lipitor, boom, ldl goes down, everybody's happy, but how? What pill do I take to solve this really looming problem that's at the end of the road called my death? Well, different religions will give you different dances, but they all certainly promise you some form of eternity. It could be in the form of reincarnation, it could be, I'll be with Jesus. It could be a divergence, but there are all sorts of ways by which I could secure my attorney and I think for most people it's very difficult to not drink that kool aid. I think it takes almost a pathological and dysfunctional to

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       say, I'm not going to buy that. I realize that I've got 80 years and I'm going to really do the best that I can drink those 80 years. I think it's a lot more comforting to say, no, this part is going to go on forever. It certainly more comforting. It's also there's something about human beings where we realized somewhere along the line that it's. There's no one alive that has any more answers about what lies beyond the great beyond after death. What lies beyond the yawning grave. No one has any answers. You can't give you what the answer is. Nothing. Nothing you would hope so are you would think that you have that answer, but have you ever done psychedelic drugs? Haven't. There you go so you don't answer so quickly. When I tell you there are two ways of of seeking to reach and mortality at one of course is it might seem a bit crass, but through just the genetic propagation, your, your children are in a sense your form of that.

Speaker 1:          00:39:31       I don't buy that. You don't like that one? It's not immortal because the earth doesn't last. I mean, unless someone figures out how to get off the planet, we only have what one point 9 billion years. I'm like, yeah, I mean we don't have enough time for anything. There's no way. There's no in mortality unless there's some sort of a fractal nature to the universe where it's life and death is just completely ongoing cycle where the deeper you go it starts again and yeah. I don't know about that. I don't know about that either, but it is possible. The universe itself is so bizarre and unexpected and the more you look into the universe, like I remember when I was a kid, I used to think space. I used to think of space like a neighborhood. I really did. I, I remember very succinctly that, uh, I would like look at like buck rogers and all these different space, like, oh, they're going to go over to this town and they're going to come back and this is our neighborhood.

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       They're going to go to that neighborhood and come back. And then as I got older and I started studying astronomy and I started studying the. And as I got older also the knowledge that they had about the amount of stars changed and they started talking about how there's more stars in our galaxy than there are grains of sand on all the beaches and all, you know, all the beaches on earth. And then I remember just thinking like, well, this is a motherfucker of a neighborhood. Like this is starting to get really strange. All right? And then as you get older, still you realize that they, there's no way they know how big it all is. They have a general sense of 14 plus billion light years. But then there's the fractal nature of black holes. The possibility that inside every galaxy is a black hole that contains an entirely new universe. And this is something that's being thrown about by, not by freaks, but by like real serious, legitimate scientists. So that alone is so bizarre. The idea that you live and die seems very trivial. They come back again or reincarnation mean why not? If a, if a supernova can exist, no, why is it so crazy that a person lives for and just

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       continues to reincarnate? Well, and in light of all that vast vastness that you said, isn't it incredible that all of the monotheistic, Abrahamic religions would argue that on some small speck of sand in some bronze age point, God spoke to some profit and told them, you really better not eat pig know. So in this great unit universe, ca know this cosmos, it's really important that you don't wear leather, leather shoes that young people or whatever. It's just astonishing to me that people actually buy this stuff. Well, I think that the reason for the pig stuff, and there's, there's, there's, I've, I've talked about this recently with my friend already who, uh, was raised very religious Judaism and then as he got older just decided to abandon it all. Now he's at dirty comedian, hilarious, but um, we were talking about that the pork thing was probably due to diseases.

Speaker 3:          00:42:27       I talk about that in my analysis, so I, I don't, I don't do the analysis for a pork, I do it for shellfish and so if you look at shelf red tide and things along those lines so you can't tell which one is infected, you can't look at the water and, and, and predict which one would likely have the bacteria. And so all you know is that once in a while somebody would eat it and drop that. Since you don't have any ability during the bronze age to refrigerate and so on, well you don't have any access to the germ theory. Certainly they didn't know anything about that. Well then it must be some mild addiction. And so you're exactly right that there are very, very clear, obvious biological explanations for most of these food taboos. Yeah. It's just ridiculous that in 2014 Peter People don't realize the origins of these.

Speaker 3:          00:43:18       Like yes, it was a great idea 2000 years ago before we understood thermometers that you you have to cook your meat to 150 degrees that kills the bacteria and then it's perfectly, totally healthy, but if you try to eat pork the same way, you will try to eat venison, you're going to get really sick and that's why religions like, hey look, if we want to keep our people alive, we've got to tell them not to eat. This particular animal is an animal that eats a lot of stupid shit. Exactly. Yeah, so religion has been the biggest blow back of your work or actually probably the ones that are, that were the most acerbic and their criticisms have been other social scientists even more. Yeah, because the social sciences have very much developed over the past hundred years with a complete rejection of biology. How is that a science then? They called social sciences. You rejected biology, which is measurable and Social Sciences sort of. Well, what they argue is that what makes us human is that we transcend our biology, so don't use the evolutionary mechanisms that explain the behavior of the Zebra and the dog and the mosquito to explain our behaviors. What makes us it human is

Speaker 4:          00:44:31       precisely that we're able to transcend these biological imperatives. And so, uh, the field of anthropology, not anthropology, which is a subset of anthropology that recognizes biology, but for example, cultural anthropology is all about going to all of these exotic cultures and demonstrating how each culture is unique and different. And hence there are no such thing as human universals. A social psychology is pretty much operated without any understanding of biology. So what I did in my work as I came along and I founded this field which I coined evolutionary consumption, where I apply evolutionary theory in biology to study consumer behavior, but more generally my, my real goal is to what I call maybe it's a grand goal to Darwin eyes, the business school. The idea is that you can study anything. You can't study invest investment psychology or personnel psychology or organizational behavior or consumer behavior without recognizing that all of these players are biological beings, right?

Speaker 4:          00:45:25       The decision that you make if your blood sugar is low and you're hungry is very different than decision you make if you're satiated, right? I mean, that's a trivial example, but a very obvious one. So the idea that economists have spent 100 years developing all these fanciful mathematical models without ever recognizing that there are these biological forces that compel us to be the decision makers that we are is astounding to me. So the greatest blow back has been from social scientists who typically have been very reticent to accept what this biology boys saying about consumer behavior and so on. Fascinating. Not the good news. Can I kind of go on please? I always use a quote by a guy called the JBS Haldane, who was a very evolutionary geneticist who was very quotable, very had all these great clips. So he said that there are four stages that scientists go through before they accept the theory. And I'll start paraphrasing. So Stage one, this is bullshit. This is garbage stage two, well this might be true, but it's rather perverse stage three. Well, this, this is true, but largely unimportant and stage four or I always set so

Speaker 3:          00:46:37       the reason why that quote

Speaker 4:          00:46:39       captures, I mean if I ever did an autobiography of my scientific career, I. That quote is basically my book because I've seen people go through these four stages in their responses to my work. At first I couldn't get an invitation to go to to get 20 minutes at a, at a conference to speak because what? What does biology you have to do with anything and now of course sciences and author corrective process. The evidence is coming in my way and I don't mean to gloat about it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:47:05       Now they're all coming fast and furious. You're the man and I remember 10 years ago I've still kept your email where you said I was a bullshitter. No, that wasn't me. That must have been my research assistant who hacked my email. How Dane is a great guy to quote. He had a fantastic quote that I love. Not only is the universe queer than we suppose it's queer than we can it that you

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       know what, you're my. You're my new coolest guy to to actually know who, how Dane is your event. Well, it's a special quote. That's just an amazing. I'm the Beatles. I don't know the exact. Do you know this one? No, I think there are something like, I hope I'm not getting it wrong, but maybe 300,000 species of beetles and so in his quote, he basically says, you know, if God exists, he must have a particular penchant for beetles for having spent so much effort and coming up with all of these different species variations. Yeah, no kidding. Right. What, what is it frustrating being a man who is an intellectual who is trying to go over the variables and try to figure it all out and piece it together. Is it frustrating to you to see these obvious biases and this is obvious, muddy thinking that enters into this, this sort of debate.

Speaker 4:          00:48:25       It is on two levels, on sort of the intrinsic level. I'm a dog, a pursuer of the truth, and so I almost get offended by these positions and so in that sense it's frustrating, but there's also an extra, like a real sort of tangible way that it's frustrating. A lot of these gatekeepers are the ones who decide whether I get a position in southern California not. And so if I play within the paradigm, if I do the research that is expected of me, that doesn't sort of bust any existing theories that I'm good, but if I'm this guy from the outside who's trying to biologies the field, well, who, who does this guy think he is? So in that sense, I think it's also frustrating and I, my wife always tells me, well, don't worry. I mean if you can keep this, sorry, it's, it makes a big difference how you can move it around.

Speaker 4:          00:49:12       Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt. So your wife tells you something. My wife tells me, you know, I mean, don't worry, you know, you'll get all your vindication. I said, well, I don't want to get vindicated when I'm dead. The postmortems I want. I want the rewards now. And not, not in a narcissistic way, but because there are also perks to people finding out that hopefully you are correct. Now the reality is that more and more people are coming around and so if I look at the level of hostility that I faced 10 years ago versus today, it's night and day. What was the first major backlash that you experienced? What social scientists not being A. I mean having my papers desk rejected by editors. So that's great. Are you familiar with that? To explain it for people. So that means basically when you send your paper to a scientific journal, usually the editor will look at your paper and say, okay, well here are three reviewers that I think would be appropriate for this paper.

Speaker 4:          00:50:08       And then he sends it off and then the process starts and it goes back and forth for probably several, several years when he desk rejects says he's basically saying that this paper is not worthy of even going out for review. And so, you know, I would send all of these papers to these top journals and the editor would write back to me. Sorry, I'm not even sending it through the review process, what do you remember what one of the original ones was? Was the subject of A. Well, the probably the first one was one where I was introducing the theoretical framework of how to apply evolutionary psychology and understanding marketing and usually the the, the argument that I would receive it, which which is breathtakingly inane and it's stupidity as well. Evolutionary theory is just a bunch of just so storytelling, right? You just come up with these fanciful post hoc stories since obviously you're not conducting an experiment in a lab to demonstrate the evolution and of course that that is so laughable because if that were true, how is it that astrophysicists study the origins of the universe that's 14 billion years ago, right?

Speaker 4:          00:51:17       They certainly don't conduct an experiment in the lab and to build their own stars all stars. Right, so but, but again, if you're very parodic magically bound to manipulating something in the lab, then somehow evolutionary theory seems epistemologically in terms of the philosophy of science. It seems as though it's. You're just waving your hand and telling stories. Post hoc stories. Now the reality is that that's exactly the opposite of what we do. If anything, there is no intellectual idea that has received as much empirical support as evolution. I mean it is as clear as gravity. Yet people somehow can't get around to understanding how you could explain something that happened hundreds of thousands if not millions of years ago. And so the original rejections were always, oh, but come on, we don't take thing on faith here. We need, we need concrete evidence. So that's how it all started. So that was the first blow back.

Speaker 4:          00:52:14       Did you. When did you hesitate when you first experienced this? Did you go, man, I'm going down a dark road and. No, because I. and that's a great question because I think I was fortunate enough to have the personality for this endeavor. In other words, it's not just that you had to have the brains to do what I was doing. If I would suck my thumb going into a fetal position and start crying every time somebody rejected me, rejected my work, then I wouldn't. But because I was a fighter, because I was a high testosterone guy, then that only compelled me to come back and say I'm going to prove these guys wrong, but at the delayed the process, because I was kept out of many of the leading consumer behavior and marketing journals for. So I kind of went around them. I published books that became best sellers. I published in medicine and Economics and psychology and only recently have I tried to come back to the to the folks that I'm most trying to convince and those are the consumer psychologist now. Luckily I'm their friend, but for years I was really sort of at the periphery. It's fascinating as well that the. The attitudes about the subjects have evolved and changed within science and within modern academia. It's, it's, it's

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       really interesting to see this sort of evolution of these ideas and the acceptance of ideas that didn't exist before. But along with the new craziness, the new fat acceptance and you know, all this other nonsense, this new politically correct terms in this parasitic thinking that you saw described so well, this is the new threat to, to unbiased, objective thinking. Absolutely is desired and offend no one ever. Absolutely. And, and you know, the reality is that now there's a thing called, have you heard of trigger warnings? Love it. I love them my whole life to trigger warning. That's exactly what I said. I'm going to put in my course outline. Warning life is a trigger warning. That's it. So, I mean, imagine that it. As a matter of fact, I, I, in my Wellesley talk that I mentioned earlier, I put up a list of, suggests the suggested topics that these trigger warning folks were saying required trigger warnings.

Speaker 3:          00:54:30       I mean, it was literally everything. That discussion of pregnancy, of sex, of disease, of war, of criminality, of mating, all of these things could potentially, uh, cause some distress to somebody and should therefore come with a trigger warning. Now for somebody who escaped Lebanon under immediate threat of execution, I look at that and say, we're, we're, uh, this is a decadent society in that if that's the things that worry people, they should really go spend a day in the neighborhoods where I grew up and then maybe they'd have a different perspective as to what they should be picketing against. I agree entirely in my term is, I mean my, not my term, my thought is that people are just so used to this soft life of everything being really easy to achieve, that they have never developed this understanding of the, first of all, how fortunate we are to be living this in this time and age to experience this easy life that we live in, but that we're really lucky.

Speaker 3:          00:55:37       We're really lucky and to focus on a bunch of nonsense and to get carried away thinking about all these ultra supersensitive notions and to dwell on them as if in some way you're going to make the world a better place by doing now. Like it's nonsense. It's preposterous because it's their posers. Right? And so a way to demonstrate that. I care, but in doing it with very little cost, to me, it takes a lot more guts to stand up against Islam than to stand up against some hick evolution, denying senator who's Republican. So for example, if I look at my facebook friends, if I put up a post that is critical of the senator who was a Redneck, a Republican, I'll get from my academic colleagues 80 likes and at some inane, silly thing, but if I put some horrifying reality about 200,000 Syrians being butchered, they are so loud in their silence because that's scary.

Speaker 3:          00:56:43       Right? And so the, for example, the western feminists are very, very quick to chastise David Letterman if he makes a sexist joke or whatever it was to his intern that shows great courage, but so to speak against genital mutilation in the Islamic world or other parts of the world or all kinds of other injustices that women face. Well, we should be quiet about that. I mean, look at the Ion Hirsi Ali issue. I don't know. Are you familiar with that? No. No. Do you know who I am? Hirsi Ali is in Hirsi. Ali is a woman who was born into Islam who escaped an arranged marriage, move to, to Netherlands, became a Dutch parliamentarian, and then was part of a documentary that was offensive to, to, uh, some Muslims and then she had to have then protection for the rest of her life, now has moved to the United States and has spent pretty much her entire career fighting for the rights of women, not just Muslim women, women in general, but of course many Muslim women in those areas are, are mistreated.

Speaker 3:          00:57:43       So Brandeis University, the sites to bestow her, this is very recently, a couple of months ago, but still bestow her a, I think, uh, maybe honorary doctorate or speech convocation to speak at the convocation. And then all of the professors rallied against this woman who is speaking on behalf of half the population called women. Right? And they said this is a hate monger and Islamophobic, blah, blah, blah. And so they rescinded her invitation. Oh, and there you go. So, you know, I mean, we're pretty much lost as a society if we can't identify who the heroes are and who is on the right side of each issue, right? Not just that, but the educators are the ones that are having this issue. The educators are the ones that are having a hard time recognizing who's on the right side of things that I think there's one very important thing that you, uh, you brought up and it's the social aspect, the social gratification, that's social reward aspect of supporting things that we all agree upon that these Hicks senators are bad, that you know, and then the scariness of Islam, the, the scariness of criticizing the Muslim world.

Speaker 3:          00:58:59       And then this, this concept of Islamophobia that's sort of gotten to people's minds, but that thing that people do where they seek out what I call socially Progressive Brownie points. Exactly like men who declare themselves openly feminists, male feminists like, look, I'm a humanist. I believe that we are all just brothers and sisters on this planet. All of us, including people and other cultures and countries. And I'm not a nationalist. I think it's all nonsense. I really do. I mean I would love it if we could all understand each other. I think it would make a lot more sense if we spoke one language so I could understand people in China, but I don't feel about them any differently than I feel about a guy lives down the street. I try very hard to work on that. So when I get this, this thing where people start identifying with one gender and one gender specifically and there's another thing that men are doing where they're not only proclaiming themselves as a male feminist, but they're also saying that if they are unjustly accused of something that they would happily be unjustly accused of something if it could somehow another prevent women from being persecuted.

Speaker 3:          01:00:11       What martyrs in that amazing. They're so cool and strong like that, but I think it's. I don't know if you know the term identity politics is that I've heard the term, so basically you have sort of this balkanization of different identity groups and there is what's called a poker identity game. You know which, which identity group has larger victimology and greater grievances and the top group that you really can't touch our, our people of the Muslim faith. What about Islamic transgender male feminist that that's. That's the royal flush. That's you're holding the royal flush right there. You're a fucking. Yeah, you can't be beat and you've got five jokers at my university and my university right now in Montreal. At one point I sat precisely because people had a sense of some of the positions I held. They asked me to come in and sit on a religious accommodation committee.

Speaker 3:          01:01:09       We're a secular university in a secular society officially as the official law. So what does it mean to say that we're going to now enact a religious accommodation policy? I mean that's like saying I am a virgin but I'm pregnant. I mean it's really the term can't make sense how. Right. So my position was I am equally non pliant to anybody's religious beliefs. If Jews come to my class and say, we want to do young people, blah, blah, blah, well I'm Jewish and I'm still going to come to the lecture, but now if Moslems come and say we want to take Hash for three weeks at Mecca so we won't be showing up to your class for three weeks. Well, I'm equally unreceptive that idea. Well, it seemed like most people were pretty happy with my general position as long as it didn't apply to this one particular group.

Speaker 3:          01:01:58       Now that suicidal, right? That can't be because that's already institutionalizing the fact that people are not all equal. Right? Some people deserve more accommodations than others. That's dangerous. Right? That's so in the US. Freedom of religion also includes, as you know. I mean it's a cliche. Freedom from religion, be religious, just don't put it in my face, but I think in our desperate desire to constantly accommodate people would going down the wrong path, but not just constantly accommodate people, but accommodate people that are perceived to have been persecuted, only not accommodate. People that have a contrary point of view, not debate them or look at them all objectively true and consider all the various possibilities. Have we been incorrect in our thinking? Is this a possible like the woman that you were talking about that from Brandeis. I mean, that's, that's unbelievably shocking for someone who have gone through something so horrifying to be escaping running for their life, really escaping to America and then to be called an Islamophobia.

Speaker 3:          01:03:00       That's right. And as you said, who is spearheading that? The professors and by the way, Brandeis University, as you may know, was founded by a liberal a lot by brandeis who was trying to kind of found an institution that would be open to all that would be pluralistic precisely because of some of the antisemitism that Jewish students would have faced at some of the sort of northeastern schools. And so the school is founded on these principles. And then at the first opportunity you violate everything that you stand for. Is there any movement to try to change this? Is there any discussion to try to, uh, this sort of real issue with academia as well? If I can be a modest, I think it's guys like me who are trying, who are really in the wilderness who try to come out of the woodworks and have the courage and the big festivals to try to do that, but I think most people have heard instinct, but even if you say that you have the testicles to do this, how dare you.

Speaker 3:          01:03:59       You can't do this with ovaries. Is that what you're saying? I apologize for having said that. I have testicle now. It's this. It's an expression of courage. Women have balls too. I know a lot of checks with balls if you look at it that way, but it's unfortunate that a woman has to hear that and go, oh well, great. It's associated with male gender have. Well that's true, but if a guy is a great guy, oh, that guy's the tits. I mean that is something that people say to like my friend Steve, he says every everything is good. He calls titties titties movie man. Like I used to be a competitive soccer player and the kind of trash talking that would happen as, as you would know your athlete is astounding. The things that would be sad for example of calling you some homophobic slur name go to move, right?

Speaker 3:          01:04:49       Or, or calling you. I mean, I remember at one point I played in the league called the Black Lake where you would only to not to non black guys. I was one of them and so they, you know, I would if somebody with tackling and say, you know, stop whining, get up white bitch right now in today's now. Usually the way I fought that as I say, I'm not going to get by this guy next time around and I'm going to score a goal. I didn't kind of curl into a fetal position. Start crying. Well today they are. I mean facetiously that are commissar standing around the field, making sure that nobody, others, any of these slur words because then you could be taken to hate speech code tribunal mean in Canada. We have hate speech laws. They. How could that be? Now, of course, I'm not suggesting that we should all be insulting one another and of course we should all be kind and gentle to each other, but the idea that if you tell me a white bitch, I could actually impose upon you to go to a hate speech tribunals is astounding.

Speaker 3:          01:05:48       I mean, what? What's freedom of speech? Freedom of speech is the right to also be an asshole. Correct. And, but unfortunately now everything is sanitized. Everything is just freedom of speech is the right to be an asshole. But on, in other terms, freedom of speech, on the other hand, in response to your being an asshole is the right to ostracize you like the right to get you out of social groups and that's how you recognize asphalts exactly, but when you sanitize the world and remove half the language and put trigger warnings out for everything that everybody says, it's very difficult to get to the heart of what someone's trying to communicate, right? When we're making mouth noises, trying to express our thoughts. And we're limited in such an amazing way by so many different forms of expression. Well, a, here's a great example that's happening all over the West and certainly in Canada and the US try to give a lecture or invite somebody either that has a pro Israel position or an anti Islam position and go to UC Irvine and see what happens.

Speaker 3:          01:06:50       Uh, the, the, the former ambassador of Israel tried to come and give a lecture and I mean, it wasn't an incendiary thing. He wasn't going to be saying some horribly controversial things and yet they tried to shut them down. Benjamin Netanyahu, the current prime minister of Israel was shut down at my university. Wow. At Concordia University in Montreal, the Prime Minister of a democratic elected government are only supposed to true ally in the Middle East was unable to speak because there was great a threat of danger. Now that's a v astonishingly dangerous, right? I mean, if, if, if that guy can't speak, probably you and I are not going to have much of a voice. There was a university in Toronto, I forget which one, but there was a speech by a guy who was considered to be a men's rights advocate with the, the, the insult as they call them Mras and he had written a book and he was giving the speech and these feminists were protesting and York University was at York.

Speaker 3:          01:07:54       I think it was your and violent opposition and what he had, what they had said that he said and what he actually said. It was so completely diametrically op. I mean was so incorrect that it was almost like they'd never read what he had said. They had just decided that this was a target because he was a. He was an example. He was a figurehead of the patriarchy and so they. These people were showing up for these lectures like, look, I, I, like I said, I read websites that I don't agree with. I watch a republican debates. I watch. I watched these bizarre Republican Fox News talk shows where they have these insane views of the world. I don't agree with them. I watch it because I'm fascinated. I watch it because I want to know what this knucklehead thinks about, you know, God and climate change.

Speaker 3:          01:08:42       God has a great sense of humor. You know, look the world, have we. We played a video the other day of a woman who's. She's running for Congress. It's crazy bitch. She, she was. She said, I can prove there's no global warming with a simple tool, a thermometer, and she pulls it out like I'm fascinated by that lady. I will watch that lady talk. It doesn't mean I'm. I agreed with her. So these, these feminists is radical feminists as it were. Whatever your radical. Anyway, anything we usually an idiot, but these radical feminists, we're keeping people from attending this. Not just the people that were speaking, you know, they weren't protesting the people that were speaking, they were screaming and yelling at the people they're trying to go into, listen to this person talk, agree or disagree. The idea that you are trying to oppose or trying to stop you are in opposition of a person listening to a contrary point of view.

Speaker 3:          01:09:32       That's amazing. Well, I already dangerous, very dangerous. I wrote an article on my psychology today blog, uh, maybe about two years ago where this wasn't my study. I was just simply summarizing somebody else's work, what he had basically done, or I think there were several researchers, they had looked at the political leanings of professors at American universities, uh, whether they're Democrat or Republican and they actually then broke it down by departments. So for example, what would be the Democrat versus Republican ratio in sociology versus in physics? What they found is that I think if I'm going on memory, I think that the ratio is about five to one Democrat to Republican and in some departments, most notably, for example, in the humanities and sociology and so on, it was 44 to one. Now I, I, I didn't present this as this is good or this is bad, but I certainly was trying to make the point that on some issues that's not a good idea.

Speaker 3:          01:10:33       For example, what should be fiscal policy, um, you know, what should be our position regarding immigration. Uh, uh, what, what is the position regarding the death penalty? These are not clear sort of scientifically, you know? Right. I mean, it depends. And to have a sanitized campus, we're only one group of people really dominate. I thought was dangerous. You should've seen the blowback. I got there. Now, the only thing that protects me in such situations is that being Canadian, I could say these things without appearing as though I have a dog in the fight. Hey, I'm not Democrat, I'm Republican Canadian, so I must be unbiased and in a sense they'll give me a bit of a get out of jail card because I. It doesn't appear as though I'm fighting for one or the other, but still the blow back was astonishing because how dare I point to this as though it were a bad thing.

Speaker 3:          01:11:25       I mean, everybody knows that every Democrat is perfect on everything and every Republican is an idiot, you know, toothless evolution, denying buffoon. And that strikes me as astonishing from otherwise intelligent people. The world is more nuanced, right? There are many issues on which I agree with Democrats as a Canadian. They are a few issues on which I actually agree more with Republicans. Uh, and so I kind of pick and choose my battles, but that's not how it is in academia, but in their defense though, the points that are taken by the Republicans so often are there really, if you had to choose, like one side that's paying attention to science and one side that's paying attention to religion, it's pretty clear except well listen, and I'm going to have solutionist. So obviously when it's going to come on that issue, I'm going to be a lot more with the Democrats then all the.

Speaker 3:          01:12:15       But for example, my position, you may disagree. I hope you don't kick me out of here. I will never take you out of your very kind of the death penalty. I think that if you are having raped and killed 10 children and we've got the DNA of, of you on the potential, it's incontrovertible that you are guilty. Uh, I don't see it as a terrible moral issue that we could potentially discuss the possibility of executing you. As a matter of fact, I think that in some cases, the amount of rights that we give to otherwise horrifying monsters, that itself is barbaric. So on that dimension, I'm likely to be much more quote Republican and I am as well. I agree with you 100 percent. So know nuance thinking is as a mark of somebody who kind of has a sense of what the world looks like.

Speaker 3:          01:13:03       And I think that that's also a mark of someone who doesn't have a dog in the fight. As I said before. I think when you look at the world, there's a lot of variables that must be taken into consideration as soon as you deny those variables because you have a specific stance. It's a predetermined pattern of thinking that you've aligned yourself with. I'm on the left and as a Democrat, like I was having a conversation with someone the other day and they were talking to you about upcoming elections and they said if we lose the house, if we lose, like he's a fucking comedian. He's a comedian that I'm talking to and he's talking about the Democrats and he's on team. And I'm like, wow, I'm 100 percent for the death penalty in terms in like a Ted Bundy type character. Some monster. But my problem with it, my number one problem with it is that I don't believe that the system is a good system. I don't. I don't believe it's an infallible. I think there's a lot of issues when it comes to people who are prosecutors who deny evidence, withhold evidence. They, they, they know that they're wrong and they still arrest people. They still prosecute people. This has been so many instances of that. I can't trust

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       their judgment. I can't trust. There was a video the other day of a man who's a police officer pulling some woman she was trying to resist. He threw it to the ground and he's beating her, punching her in the face in, in Los Angeles, and as long as that is a part of our legal system that this, this guy. I mean she wasn't fighting back. He wasn't. He wasn't fighting for his life. She was resisting. I don't know what the circumstances were, but whatever I know is, if that is the only way you can handle that woman, you shouldn't be a police officer. And as ridiculous, as long as that exists, that's part of our legal system. That's just a human flaw that exists on all levels that will exist as far as a police officer who's on the street that will exist as far as a prosecutor, as a judge, a person running a prison. There's going to be human flaws and the entire system. And that's the only reason why I hesitate as far as. But in that sense, yeah, I'm way more Republican than I am Democrat.

Speaker 5:          01:15:06       I, I tell you a story about a sort of police misconduct, uh, many years ago I had met a guy who would serve as a public defender in the La county system. And as we were chatting, you know, I was very interested in all of this stuff that he had to say. He said to me, one advice I could give you is don't ever do anything in California that will have you end up in La County jail. And I said, Oh, why's that? I said, give me an example of why would somebody like me. He goes, let's suppose you were a recidivist drink and drive kind of guy, and the cops are pissed off at you. They'll take you to the jail, they'll throw you with all the gangbangers and they'll simply scream out fresh fish out of water. That's exactly the term that he used, which basically is the code word for have that in boys and we won't, we won't hurt here. His screams and, and I remember this, this, this isn't in the late eighties. And subsequently I actually met the son of the sky coincidentally and later found out that that was his father by quincy. He was an academic also. But anyway, so that's, that's an example of misconduct where, you know, if you piss off these gaps, they could do all sorts of things to you that can have some profound consequences on your body.

Speaker 1:          01:16:21       Yeah. I just want to state for the record, I'm a big supporter of law enforcement. Always have been one bad cop is not cops make bad, make all cops are bad. Humans were flawed, you know, not every, not every doctor is a good person. I mean, I have a friend who used to work when he was younger, he worked at a resort and he said he would overhear these doctors very specifically remembered overhearing these doctors bragging about talking this guy into a surgery and about how he's going to buy a car now, you know, like, uh, that's a, that's a new whatever it was, porsche, whatever. For me, you know, this. And he was bragging about talking to this kind of surgery. Incredible. Yeah, I mean, that's real. That does happen. You know, there there's bad people in all walks of life and I think that that is my number, my only really resistance to something like the death penalty. But when you look at the recidivism rates for child rapists, it's just through the roof. It's crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:17:18       I don't know if you've seen the stat I, and I can't cite who came up with it, but uh, apparently when you catch a pedophile, he's on average committed 100 transgressions prior to you catching him for the first time. Right. So, so why does this guy benefit from all of our legals? I mean it, you know, it. If you've done this stuff so many times, why do we have to be humane? I would actually argue it's inhumane to be so human to this guy, and I wrote an article on on psychology today where I was talking about, I don't know if you remember the case with the two guys in Connecticut who did a home invasion and they raped the girls and the mother and set the house on fire, beat the father, but he survived and so on and so it was coming up to their death penalty and so I sort of as a tribute to that case, I wrote a, an article on my psychology today blog, which I think I titled is the Death Penalty Barbaric and I was arguing that in for these kinds of guys. No, it's not. While you should have seen my progressive enlightened cafe sipping academic colleagues scoff at my barber isn't right. What kind of Hick must it be to actually even hold those sentences?

Speaker 1:          01:18:32       Well, I got news for you, man. If it comes between, put me in jail for the rest of my life and some cage where I have to be constantly in fear of men raping me and stabbing me with tooth parses, sharp knives. I'll take death exactly that way and I think we should all, if there's no, no possible, reasonable hope for parole. The idea of keeping someone to jail and a jail to rot for the rest of their life is probably more subtle. More cruel. Exactly. Yeah. It's just bizarre. The idea that that's, that's somehow or another humane is so crazy and a lot of them, by the way, solitary confinement, which is probably one of the worst things that you could do to a person, especially a social, a social analyst person. People were weird. We need to be connected so much and one of the worst punishments you could do it just leave us alone while we're in prison, surrounded by murderers, rapists, thieves, thugs, drug dealers. The worst thing they can do is put you by yourself.

Speaker 5:          01:19:26       That's exactly right. Amazed that there's a guy, I don't remember his name, a Harvard, a professor who had studied, uh, you know, what makes people healthy for, for something like 60 years. And I think the bottom line, if I'm paraphrasing him, is that people need social relationships to be healthy. That's sort of the number one thing that maintains your health, psychological and physiological

Speaker 1:          01:19:50       and happy social relationships to exactly. I mean, I, everyone that I know that has these horrible relationships with either boyfriends and girlfriends or with their parents or with their job or the like, they seem to like carry those on like all the time. It's like becomes almost a part of the norm of. But

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       the people that I know that have healthy relationships with their boyfriends and girlfriends or wives and husbands, healthy relationships with their children, healthy relationships with their friends, those are the happiest people I know, right? Like you can't, you could foster that and you can somehow or another j generate this sort of beautiful environment around the closest people to you. You'll have a much better life. It's just that simple. And by the way, evolutionary psychologists study all of these kinds of things, uh, you know, why is it that we would jump into a river to save two brothers or better yet, why would we jump into a river to save a stranger? And, and it, it, it boils down to the fact that it's tit for tat, right? It's what's called reciprocal altruism a. are you familiar with this? So, so someone will do that for you someday.

Speaker 3:          01:20:52       Exactly. Yeah. And so the idea that, you know, as you said that it's a real punishment that put people in confinement is borne out by evolutionary theory. My friend Rammi jumped into a river to save a woman. She, uh, she was in a canoe canoe, flipped over, husband drowned. The husband's body floated face first passed him and the woman was screaming, help me, and he saw he saw her in the river and he just dove in and he's lucky. He's in incredible shape and he's an outdoorsman and he's there. He's a very good athlete, very good sweater. He's got real good endurance. So he got to death's door, like literally on death's door, thought it was over, thought it, he's not going to make it out of here, like he just sacrificed his life trying to save this woman and then rescued, or they figured out a way to shore.

Speaker 3:          01:21:37       But when he describes the feeling and the experience, it was almost beyond his control. It was like he saw this woman. It was only him. There was no one else there. He had to do it and just jumped in. While there's this thing, speaking of guys who are in the business of doing heroic acts, there's a, you've heard of the fireman fantasy. I mean that the fact that women find guys bought firemen to be very attractive and it actually turns out that there was a study that was done that actually shows us to be the case. And I have discussed this in one of my articles on psychology today. If you have a guy approach women either wearing a fireman, sooth or not, uh, his chances of getting her phone number increases quite substantially. Really if he is wearing a fireman. So how do they know this?

Speaker 3:          01:22:22       Did they do a study guide? Where do they have the same guy? Not where the firemen with the same approach and the same. Same word, same scripts, same everything. One version. It's called the field experiment. In one version you, you approach women at a cafe wearing the stuff and another version you don't. The Guy who actually did that research is a French psychologist. His name is Nicola Guy and I've actually covered a few of his studies on my website, my most read article ever over maybe three, 400,000 readers as is one of his studies where I was sympathetic because we're going to talk about the blowback issue now here again, it was a study where he looked at the likelihood

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       of women being picked up as hitchhikers as a function of their breast size. So he actually had the same woman and they artificially manipulated her breast size and on different days she would stand there. And and of course it turned out that men were much more likely to pick up the woman if she had the same woman that she had bigger breast side. So I just summarize that study, put it up, and then I remember I had gone on vacation, came back from vacation father that I had to completely gone viral, but I had a million hate mail, not just from readers, but from fellow psychologists that they bloggers who were arguing that I was peddling pornography because I had a picture as the teaser image for that article. I had a photo of a woman sitting in a passenger seat, would big wood, large breasts. Well, it seemed appropriate for the topic given that that's what the topic of the study was. But by putting that image I was objectifying women. I was treating them as sex objects. And so even though I had nothing to do with the study and I was simply summarizing somebody else's work, I was a horrifying pornographic pedaling.

Speaker 1:          01:24:15       Isn't it funny that just a photograph of a woman with large breasts is considered pornographic

Speaker 5:          01:24:20       right? Now, listen to this. So then I've also written articles on psychology today where I talk about all kinds of issues dealing with penis size. You know, so do women want a guy with a bigger penis? Are they more likely to have orgasms? She's got a bigger penis. Uh, if you're in a gay relationship, man, man, are you likely to be top or bottom as a function of your penis size? That study has been done by science, and so for those articles I put sexy images of men. So then I wrote to each of those people who had written the hate man. I said, well, in all fairness, you now have to write an equally hateful thing because I'm also sexually exploiting men's bodies. Of course they went away and never came back.

Speaker 1:          01:25:05       Yeah, well, the idea being that women are more oppressed than men are not equal, but it is equal. It's very tricky, but the idea that a woman with big breasts sitting there and I passed her seat of a car, could somehow or another be pornographic. It was ridiculous. Yeah. Women have big breasts, so some of them they exists. I'm in a big penises. It all. It's all real stuff. Some people have two eyes and noses. Interestingly, some of the

Speaker 5:          01:25:29       college, these are psychologists were saying, why do you write about these issues of sexuality? What does that have to do with psychology? Why are you so, so that psychologists could actually argue that issues dealing with sexuality were outside the purview of psychology. That's.

Speaker 1:          01:25:47       Well, it's stupid. It's really, it's scary stupid because it's denying reality in order to fit with your ideology. This ideology of politically correct thinking. And I don't like the term politically correct. I don't like it because it's been sort of overrun

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       and overused and it's kind of like, it's a beaten term, right? You know, but it's the appropriate one just to convey the idea. Right. But it's just, it's so prevalent, it's so prevalent and that the fact that it's so prevalent amongst academics is really disturbing to me. Yeah. I'm with you, you know, have you had, have you had many other academics on the show quite a bit. What's, how are they like in terms of their general positions? Um, well, many, many of them share your points of view. Oh really? Luckily. Now is it just that you happen to gravitate towards guys that you would think that already would sort of not be these little wimpy guys or, or. I mean, how come it turns out that they're all sharing because we're certainly in the minority in academia, so those are the only ones I'm interested in.

Speaker 3:          01:26:50       I guess. I mean, I'm actually quite fascinating talk. I would love to talk to some male feminist who shares these Islamic phobic hating ideas, like hating Islamophobia, and I'll send you, I'll send you some names. What the problem is, you know, it would get ugly somewhere along the line, right? You know, I'm sure one of us would resort to insults not. I wouldn't be. I wouldn't put. I am utterly fascinated by ideology, ideologies that I support or do not support, you know, all of them. I mean, I mean, I, I, I'm fascinated by the Dalai Lama. I'm fascinated by how many people take a guy who only wears orange robe. Seriously. Come on. Do you really think God gives a fuck what clothes you wear? Is He, is he staying warm in that or is he. He's no different than that fucking Phil Robertson Guy. That's from duck dynasty.

Speaker 3:          01:27:38       Always worse. Cammo was wearing a God damn outfit and buy that outfit. You recognize that he, oh, he's a man of peace and of enlightened thinking. No, he's a silly man who wears orange, doesn't have sex. Okay. And why does he not have sex? Because he has an ideology, right? This ideology tells him that he's a holy man from birth. And if you don't think that's fucking ridiculous because he's friends with Sharon stone. You and I have nothing to talk about. Oh, he's, he's buddies with Richard Gere. He must be holy. You get the fuck Outta here, man. You know, it's funny you talk about these Hollywood types. I wrote an article which one of those really popular ones on psychology today when I was talking about the narcissism and grandiosity of celebrities were, uh, they, they, uh, what's her madonna because of her cabala juice, uh, says that, uh, the radiation problem and some lake in Ukraine could be resolved by putting some cabala juice on it. And she's really, she's really astounding. Come on, wait a minute. Kabbalah Kabbalah. Holy Water. I don't know anyone. I don't want to help her in any way by bringing this up. And, you know, when Paul had some other thing about beauty, uh, the, the, um, the, the, the autism girl, everything. Oh, Jenny McCarthy, Jenny McCarthy, the autism was, was shocked that the NIH, the Institute of Health was

Speaker 5:          01:29:02       not taking her scientific research seriously demonstrating that that's what she has. Scientists know she does research. She, I think she must've played once at some point. No, but seriously, what I argue there is that, uh, you know, if you're, if you're walking all day with yes men catering to each of your whims, you actually live in a world where you truly start thinking that you're data. I mean, you really did save the world. I'm Tom Cruise and I saved the world in mission impossible, whatever, and therefore it is perfectly reasonable that I have something profound to say about everything right there for Tom Cruise says that there is no such thing as psych, psychiatric instant illnesses. You just have to do exercise and vitamins and that we don't take that seriously is really an affront to him. And so I had written an article where I was saying that it's, it's really astounding the type of narcissism that these folks and I argued that it is part, it comes from a form of guilt that deep in the recesses of their bedrooms, when they turn off the lights, many of them actually know that they are frauds that are not really deserving of all of the perks that they've received.

Speaker 5:          01:30:12       And so one of the ways that maybe I could fix that is by demonstrating that I am much more than a mere actor. I'm really helping in Darfur. I'm really helping solve the radiation problem in the Ukraine and so on and so forth. Because then I seem as though maybe I am more worthy of all the accolades that are being bestowed upon me.

Speaker 1:          01:30:31       That's a very fascinating way of looking at it. I think you probably are onto something there. I think the knowledge and the understanding that they're frauds, the deep seated knowledge, whether they avoid it and deny it or not. I there's a lot of people that are horrible people that are involved in charitable organizations and one of the reasons being is to church sort of show that they are good people. There's a guy who's a pretty blatant plagiarist who's involved in some pretty interesting charities for good charities, very good charities, but I had a conversation with someone about it and they were talking about, hey, you know what? He does so much good for this organization. I don't. I don't care. I go, do you understand that? That's probably why he does that. Like the guy's a complete sociopath. He's fucked over his friends. You stolen their work and pass it off as his own.

Speaker 1:          01:31:23       Yet he supports firefighters. Do you not understand that that's what's going on there? I mean, he's pretty obvious. If you listen to him talk for any long period of time, there's something wrong. There's like some some connections inside the mind that are not being made and he's had a strategy and a strategy to avoid criticism is to show charitable work. Like Lance Armstrong, whenever he was confronted about his drug use, would always talk about how much he's doing for cancer, for cancer research. That was this whole thing, despite the fact that he'd sued people that had claimed that they, their lives had been affected by his drug use, that they, the people that they love had been

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       drug tested and that they, you know, they lost their whole entire career and that they were aligned with Lance Armstrong did drugs with Lance Armstrong, Lance Armstrong would sue these people, you know, you're in La. And then finally came out and told the truth and you know, passed off as organization to other people. Now he's a fucking broken man and rightly so because he's a God damn sociopath. But that this instance or this insistence rather of being a part of a charitable organization and being the figurehead, not just silently like I don't, I, I'm a big fan of not talking about charities that I contribute to. I don't like to. Because I think there's something sneaky about. It's almost like it, like if you give a thousand dollars to a charity, but then you let everybody know, hey, I just get a thousand dollars to a charity. I talk about that in my books.

Speaker 3:          01:32:46       Yeah. So there's something there. You know what my money. This is an old philosophy, Jewish philosopher from the twelfth century. He's very, very important guy in Jewish moral philosophy at. He talked about eight levels of said that cuts is charity giving. Uh, in terms of the purity of the act, the most pure form of Tzedakah is where the altruist and the recipient of the altruism don't know of one another because, and he said this a thousand years ago where he had no evolutionary attorney, but I then I then package it as, as an evolutionary argument because there's great social signaling rewards that come from you writing the Joe Rogan cancer ward, right? Right. If you are in, why do the upper uppers don't drive maseratis because everybody in their circle can also buy a Maserati. So they actually drive pretty oftentime, pretty cheapest cars because that's not going to be a very honest signal of my true value because everybody in my social group can imitate it, but if I can give $100, million dollars to the soul and so cancer or buy a $100, million dollar painting that a two year old could, could have otherwise painted.

Speaker 3:          01:33:56       Boy, that's an honest signal of my quality. Right. And so I actually talk about this exact idea of, of not advertising your generosity. Yeah. I call it happiness bombs. When I leave a big tip at a restaurant, I get out of there before the waiter could see what the Ta is nice. I like to do that. I like to leave big tips and then run the fuck out of there. I don't want to see that person. I say thank you to them on the way out the door, but I don't want to see the tip and then thank me back because it almost like, you know, it takes away from it. It's like, like I said, if someone donates a thousand dollars but then tells the world they do a $1,000, I think you owe another thousand dollars, you'll, you'll always silent thousand. Do you know the, you know, you must know the show curb your enthusiasm.

Speaker 3:          01:34:35       Yes. So there's an episode on Tuesday, Asm, where Larry David is at some function with Ted Danson. They both gave anonymous donations, but everybody keeps walking up to that dance and telling you, oh, congratulations on this donation. That was so generous of you. So Larry, David go. David goes crazy because he goes, that's bullshit, man. You're from this whole thing. It's not anonymous. Nobody knows that. It's exactly what we were talking about. Right? So that whole episode was a great episode because whoever wrote it actually understands our human nature. Yeah. It's a fascinating, fascinating aspect of human beings. This, this need to be considered altruistic. Yes. Need to be considered benevolent. You know the to to advertise it instead of just being, you know that you can't exist in the silence of the personal satisfaction of contributing and giving, giving out love and generosity that you have to be rewarded for it.

Speaker 3:          01:35:31       Well, I have a section in my first book which I titled Philanthropy as a costly signal, constantly signaling and biology. So the Peacock's tail is a constantly signal because it actually serves as a really honest signal of my worth for me to carry this burden, tail and avoid predators. Then you really should take me seriously all you female hands because here I am here and I've survived. So that's called an honest signal or a costly sigma. Well, philanthropy I argue in many cases is that us on a signal? Precisely for the reasons that we're talking about. So I am fascinated by peacocks. I'm fascinated by black guys who go to clubs with $100,000 worth of jewelry on them. You know, I, I, it's amazing that, that aspect of, especially the rap community. Well, you know, the, the, the throwing the money and all the videos.

Speaker 3:          01:36:17       I'm making sure I got an article on that, man. Did you ever think that you would have a scientist on your show talking about the evolutionary roots of making it rain? Oh No. I'm so happy to be talking to you now. I was happy to talk to you already, but now more so, um, what is, what is that like the, the, the, the diamonds and the gold chains. And then why is it specifically connected to the African American community as opposed to you? I mean, the Italian American community was always gold chains a little bit, but not as much diamonds and mean black people took it to a totally new level. Right? I, I can't speak to why one culture, the sides to use one particular form of status. If you're the mass tribe in Africa, it might be the number of cattle heads that you have. That is the peacocking, right?

Speaker 3:          01:37:05       So what we do know is that different cultures will use different forms of peacocking, but in all cultures it is going to be the males in that culture who engage in the act. That's the universal, the peacock in the African American community is most fascinating because a lot of these rappers come from these very poor neighborhoods, so they're dealing with a lot of poverty and crime and as they're growing up, and then as they get older, their identities, once they become connected to success are also connected to firearms and and diamonds. Specifically diamonds. They're all day blinged out everything out teeth. Yeah. How crazy is that? You're walking around with 100,000 dollars with a dental appliances. I mean probably more. I don't understand diamonds, so I don't. I don't own any diamonds, so when I say 100,000 dollars, I don't. I might be way off. There was a company called, I don't remember the name of the company, but the project was called American brand stand.

Speaker 3:          01:38:02       A play on American bandstand. Dick Clark, they collect a. So what they did is they did they, they looked, they did a content analysis of brand mentions in billboard top 100 to see how often brands are mentioned. Hey girl, I've got the Maserati. And what they found, not surprisingly, is that it's almost exclusively in hip hop videos. It's almost exclusively male rappers who do this behavior. And it wasn't diamonds, actually, what the number one product was, cars. So cars were overwhelmingly the most often cited form of peacocking in rap video, in rap songs. I was at a, uh, an event, a kickboxing event in Los Angeles. All my friends, Eddie and tate, and we, uh, we, we showed up. This guy pulled up in this bright orange Lamborghini, this crazy car with a gold wing doors that pop up. And uh, I, we were talking and I'm a fan of cars.

Speaker 3:          01:39:03       I love cars, but I do not like lamborghinis. I think they're foolish. I think the doors are foolish. I mean they break all the time. I have a friend who reviews cars and he reviewed this Lamborghini aventador and he said it broke down after like two days ahead of, for two days. And the transmission exploded. And I was laughing about it and I was like, what the fuck? Like why would you spend a half a million dollars on that car? Like there's some brilliant pieces of. I'm a big fan of cars. I'm a big fan of engineering in general. I love well engineered watches. I love a well engineered table. I love lapped fastened. I'm fascinated by human innovation. So when I see certain cars I am fascinated by them, but when I see that one, I just think that's just so goofy and my friends were like, Bro, that car gets you posted.

Speaker 3:          01:39:49       And I was like, really? He doesn't really like come on man is a girl. What a girl bank. So we had this debate with a girl, have sex with you. She saw you in that car. Let me answer that. As opposed to please do as opposed to let's say a corvette and like, Nah man, anybody can get a corvette. The corvette is like, my friend goes, man, a girl will hop in your car just to see where you live. If you have that car, they just want to see what your house. You've got a $500,000 car. What the fuck does that do to the house? Look like south? Tell you three scientific studies, one of which is mine, and then a personal story of my brother who lives in southern California. Uh, so Nico, I get down to the guy who did the breast and French guy, a French guy that did a study, a very much similar in spirit where instead of manipulating the firemen sooth, he had the same guy approach different women as a function of an manipulated which car he was driving. I can't remember the exact details, but something like a three time increase and the likelihood of a woman giving you her phone number if you are driving high status car versus a little status car that's exactly three times three times greater. Wow. And the same guy by the way, that another study

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       where he. Yah, he was either he made the guy who was approaching the woman was either with a baby or not, and another version with a dog or not having a dog increases digits uptake, invention and have interacting with the baby also increases. So I joke that you should be driving a Lamborghini while having a dog next to you and it baby while wearing a fireman's suit. You're going to get all the ladies in Orange County and in Newport beach, so that's one and another study, and then I'm going to come to my study in the second and another study, not by this guy. They took the same men, put them either in a Bentley or in a whatever, Ford Fiesta and did the same thing with the same with a wound and then it those opposite sex rating so the women would rate the two guys and the same guy when he is in the Bentley, was viewed as astonishingly more handsome. Which of course objectives can be. I mean you have your physiology. If your physical traits don't change, but there was a glow effect from the car that he's driving. He's handsome, he's, he's a Brad Pitt and this car. He's a loser in this other car, but the same manipulation on women. Men didn't care. In other words, their evaluations of how attractive the woman was. That not depend on which car she was seated in, so

Speaker 1:          01:42:16       I would think that with men and with women that the women, it would be more intimidating to the men if the women drove a Bentley all because they have status perhaps. Well especially if you have a Toyota, some crappy, nice car, Toyota, you know, not a bad car but just not a high status car. But if you pulled up in a, you know, whatever, you know, name it, Chevy, cobalt or something like that and the, you know, the girl you're going to go on a date with, pulls up in a Lamborghini like, ah, what the fuck. Right. I would think that for some men they find that someone, men find women that are very successful, intimidating here. They were just, they were just asking them how good looking do you think they are? So specific to physical attraction. Okay. Yeah. So the. Yeah, I would say the physical attraction wouldn't change, but I would say that the desire to approach that person or the willingness to approach that person. I'm with you. Yeah. I think, uh, women with, with like a really expensive car would be intimidating.

Speaker 5:          01:43:11       Third Study and then the personal story from my brother, uh, I did a study a few years ago where I brought. This was a former graduate student of mine. We brought people into the lab and then we rented a porsche. This wasn't imagined. You're driving a porsche. We actually rented a Porsche and as I, as I tell one of my ted talks, try to get a, a granting agency to release money to do research where you're going, where you're saying we're saying I'm going to rent a porsche for the weekend as part of my research. So, uh, we rented a Porsche and then we had some other beaten up car and we had the same men drive both cars either in downtown Montreal on a Friday evening where everybody could see you driving the car or on a semi desert highway where nobody could see you. And at the end of each of the driving conditions, we collected salivary assets to then measure their fluctuating levels of testosterone.

Speaker 5:          01:44:06       And the idea being that when you put them in the Porsche, it's going to explode and that's exactly what we found. And now one of the reviewers had written, he said, what? How do you know that that's just not because they're driving fast. And so that's causing a rise in testosterone. And the way we could control for that is an downtown Montreal on a Friday evening. It's bumper to bumper traffic. It's, I mean it's, it's, it's like being in a parking lot, so it's certainly not because you were driving fast. It's because everybody could see that I am sitting in a porsche. So you're endocrinological system exploded simply because of this imbuing of social status to you. And we know this from other animals where if you and I fight, if we're two males, we fight. If you win, your testosterone goes up. If I lose my testosterone goes down. And so here we were applying this exact idea to the consumer setting.

Speaker 1:          01:44:55       So the person that was in the fast car that was on all deserted stretch of highway just going fast. Their testosterone didn't rise. No, it did. It did. We actually

Speaker 5:          01:45:04       predicted that it would rise in both those conditions, but it would rise more when there's a public audience to see you doing it. That makes sense. What we found is that irrespective of the environment, you put a young male and a Porsche, has endocrinological system explodes at the. So the environment didn't matter. Just the fact that you are interviewing me with this immediate social status, uh, resulted in the same increase in testosterone.

Speaker 1:          01:45:32       Well, there isn't it also an engine thing too with young men. I know that they've done studies where they had young men rev engines just like a v eight, a powerful va. Just the sound of that increases testosterone, increases testosterone. I think. I know that study. You ain't gonna need to send me that. Yeah, I will as soon as I find it. Um, but the, the, the test that you give them, how much of a variable or how much of a variance was there between not driving that car and driving that car statistically significant. So it was certainly strong enough to pick up a big difference from the toyota to the other car. Do you remember the percentage? I don't know. I could send you the paper would be big for athletes. Just drive around in a fast car. It'd be good for your recovery because testosterone with it.

Speaker 5:          01:46:20       Great. With my wife and I tell her that since men as they enter middle age, their testosterone goes down. If I now have to buy a luxury car that's just medically mandated,

Speaker 1:          01:46:30       well is that what's going on when men have this midlife crisis, like that's always the joke with women that they see a guy in a ferrari and he's like 50 years old. Sorry about your penis, but is that. Well I did. I have a study that's not yet published. Speaking the car. You

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       drive in some morphological features, you're going to like this one. So this is not published yet. With one of my former doctoral students, we actually have. We created online dating profiles of a man where everything's the same except that in one version his prized favorite position is a fancy red porsche or some shitty key or whatever it is. And then we asked men and women who were looking at this profile to evaluate the guy's height. Watch what happened. Men, when they evaluate the guy with the porsche denigrate has height, shorter women increases height. This is exactly what you would expect from an evolutionary perspective, right? Sure. Right status as a threatening queue for men. Therefore it serves as an intrasexual rivalry queue. So if you are in a fancy car or joe must be some short, wimpy guy, women on the other hand, we'll look at joe the exact same joe.

Speaker 5:          01:47:47       He your heIght didn't magically change and say, wow, joe was a tall guy. Very fascinating. You should study haters. It's. You should study like haters of celebrities, like someone who becomes like a justin bieber type character, especially someone who's a, a famous person who women just go like if justin bieber goes anywhere in public, women will literally scream and pass out. LIke almost elvis. Like in some ways he's just study like what the reaction is to men. I wonder if there's a latest study that that is. That's fascinating to me. StudYing haters. That's a good one. So let me tell you about my, are we still okay on time? Yeah, that's great. We have an hour. Oh great. Uh, so I have a brother who was living in California for 30 years at, who, by the way I think I'd sent you this email, was a fighter, was a judo olympian, judo fighter who played in the 19 plate who competed in the 1976 olympics.

Speaker 5:          01:48:37       So, and he used to always say, by the way, before it was ever an entity, I would always ask them if you were in a fight at a bar against some boxer or some karate guy who would win, which was kind of what started the whole mna thing. And he used to alwaYs tell me, oh, I will destroy them because they might get one hit on me, but once I get them, then once we go down on the ground there, they're done. Uh, so anyways, uh, so he, he, he made a lot, a lot of money in the software industry in southern California. And so he used, he was the classic kind of peacocking guy. He owned three ferrari's and aston martIn lagoon, the so on and so we would. He would play this game to, to, to my chagrin, he liked to play this game.

Speaker 5:          01:49:27       We'd go to a nightclub. This is before I was married in case my wife was listening, but this was before we were married. We would walk into a bar, these fancy schmancy clubs, and he'd say, take your time and look around and find the most stunning unattainable in this space. Not take yoUr time. So I'd go around, look around. I picked the girl who's not only the most beautiful, but the one who is clearly accompanied by a guy who looks like a brute and they seem to be very intensely in love. So now it's. I've really raised the bar of him not being able to get her. Now. My brother is about five, four, three. So you know, he's not taught so on. But boise carrying the big testicles of owning almost ferrari's. And so he said, okay, that's the goal. you, you, you, you want me to approach?

Speaker 5:          01:50:18       Okay. So the she had to wait like a shark and then the girl and the guy would go to the bathroom. He approached the girl he'd, he'd come up to about here on her. I mean, it was just incredible to watch. He'd come back to me and say, she'll call me tomorrow. I said, absolutely zero chance. David's, it's not going to happen. Next morning he'd say, come over here. It. At the time we had the answering machines. This is like maybe early nineties. Hi david. It's candy. I was, we met. Yes. Well what got him candy? It was the fact that.

Speaker 3:          01:50:51       What would you say to them? I don't know. I have three ferrari's. Come with me. I like the you arabic accent. I know you have a man, but he is stupid. Is big, but he does not have cars. But look, the reality is that whenever we went anywhere in one of those cars, I just noticed anecdotally that the women would be all over the place. Is that changing with time when people become more aware of how kind of peacocky and it becomes more of a cultural sort of a caricature too? right.

Speaker 5:          01:51:21       I think what happens is that the, the product that we use for the peacocking might change. So for example, maybe in the cafe sipping a parties in hollywood. It might be that I drive a prius. You. I was so happy you just said that. Right? So that now makes me the, the, the top dog. This is actually a paid for by a colleague of mine, I think it's called

Speaker 3:          01:51:43       green to be seen, which is basically a form of conspicuous consumption based on being green rather than being in the big hummer or whatever. So the bottom line is that the signal itself will change, but the need to signal as a form of a mating strategy is always they're more progressive brownie points. I keep track of the amount of prius's that I catch throwing cigarettes out the window. I'm up to eight, eight creases in my life. I have observed throwing cigarettes out the window. I get fucking furious because I know those fucks. I know what they're doing right? They dry. A lot of them drive those things, not for the consumption, not for gas, low keeping gas prices down there doing it because they want to appear green. Exactly.

Speaker 5:          01:52:29       There's actually studies that look at how much are you willing to pay extra for a green product and oftentimes what people say attitudinally and then what they do if it affects their dollar, there's a big and continually so you see the ocracy of people.

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       Right. Again, as the posing, right? I mean I want to appear as though I'm enlightened, progressive. I care about mother earth and so. Well most certainly. I mean I'm a hunter and I've experienced this weird thing where people who were leather and eat meat get angry at you for hunting and one of the reasons why they're angry at you for hunting is somehow or another what you're doing is animal cruelty that you don't have to do it. Why not go to a supermarket? This was like incredibly narrow minded way of thinking and I'm like, you have a leather couch. Do you understand that? The animal that you set it on every day suffered, unimaginable, cruel to the animal that I shot, didn't even know I was there until I put an arrow through. It's hard. Do you ever feel any gumption at doing it or no?

Speaker 1:          01:53:32       Yeah. No. That definitely. It's not an easy thing to do. It's not I, I eat meat. I liked me. I've always eaten meat. Um, I've worked out a lot and I find that I've, I've, I've tried being a vegetarian once when I was competing, um, back when I was fighting and I didn't perform as wild and have as much energy and it feels good and granted, in all fairness, my knowledge of nutrition was far less than than it is now. And I didn't have the beSt diet in the world was also very young. But, um, I, you know, animals like humans live a finite life and I think that they eat each other. They're the world that they live in is. I'm an unbelievably cruel. And if it wasn't for getting killed by a hunter, it's not like they're going to live forever and become magic.

Speaker 1:          01:54:13       Okay. They, they get killed by coyotes and mountain lions and I like going into that world and acquiring meet. My goal is at the end of 2014. All the meat I eat at home to only be from my hunting. Okay. Yeah. Because I feel like that's the most ethical way to do this. I go to different places like I've been, uh, I've only been hunting for times. I shot two deer. I shot a pig and a wild pig and a shot a bayer recently, only animals that I eat, only animals that I want to eat. And my freezer is filled with bear meat, venison and yeah, I mean, that's what I, that's what I try to eat. I try to eat that. First of all, it's super healthy, you know, the, uh, the animal, you know, hasn't been shot up with antibiotics and hormones. It's just a natural animal.

Speaker 1:          01:55:01       And again, it's living its life in a wild way until I dip into the food chain and remove it. But it's not, it doesn't, it feels good to accomplish it. Like the first time I did it, it was much more somber than it is now. Now it seems like, um, uh, have sort of accepted what it is and I'm a much happier after it's over. I don't, I don't have this sort of somber feeling. the firsT time it was happiness, but also like, wow, it just, I just took an animal's life. Big animal, 180 pound deer. Like this is a lot of, there's a lot involved in this. This is real. But what about, what's your position? We're talking about conspicuous consumption and signaling. How about trophy hunting? I don't like that at all. I have a real problem with that. Not only Do I have a real problem with trophy hunting, I have a real problem with what they're doing in africa.

Speaker 1:          01:55:52       These days is a high fence hunting, but it's very strange. And here's the contradiction. Here's where it gets weird. I had louis theroux. Do you know who he is? The documentary and from england, I'm not sure. Great guy. And really fascinating and beautiful documentary and he's just a really wonderful documentaries. And he had this one where he went to this african hunting camp for several weeks and stayed there and tried to really understand what it was all about and interviewed all these people and a lot of them were just despicable. They're just these real hickey people. Like, yeah, I'm just gonna. Get her. I'm gonna. Try to get the big five, I'm going to get a ride home. We get an elephant and all they want to do is spend money and bring home tusks and horns and all this different shit. It's pretty gross because it's just they're killing to acquire trophies and what they're doing is they're killing inside these high fences where these animals, it's not like you're out there, you're going to.

Speaker 1:          01:56:47       And it's not to say that I'm opposed to high fence hunting because I think if you're hunting a deer or an animal that you're just going to eat, it's essentially a like not that much different than going to a lake that's been stocked. If you're going to a lake and they stock the lake with trout to ensure that there's fish to fish, those fish are not going to get out of that lake and flied in Nebraska. Right. That's where they live. They're stuck there and I don't think there's any difference between that, like these high fence hunting operations in Texas, which I don't have any problem with it all. They have like these thousand acres in. One of them I know of is 14,000 acres and they keep deer on it. And why do they have the fences up? Well to keep poachers out to keep to.

Speaker 1:          01:57:27       And they also, they make a lIving off of guiding people to hunt these animals. And for them it's like the ethical, uh, acquiring of have your own meat and it's venison. It's very delicious. Tastes good. It's good for you. It's very healthy meat. I don't have a problem with that. With the african thing is so confusing because there was a woman recently that was on the news this past week. She was 19 years old. She went to africa and took all these photos with her than with a lion that she killed. I might have shared that on myself, but that wasn't a week. Who? I did one you did recently, but it was a different one. I've followed all your stuff for awhile. Um, but, um, you had you, you said it's disgusting and she was holding the mouth. Yeah, that's dark. There's something dark about that man.

Speaker 1:          01:58:14       I mean, if you're not going to eat that animal. I mean I don't. I have a friend is going lion hunting in the wild. He's a bowhunters named cameron hanes. He's going to eat a lion though. He's going to go over there. He's going to hunt it in, in, in the. Not in the high fence. He's going to Zimbabwe and the actual jungle. He's got a hunt, a lion and he's going to eat it. You know, he's fucking crazy to, to, to, to, to collect salivary assets from these types of guys. Pre, pre, no post killed. But he's got. Oh, testosterone before and after. Right. But I guarantee you that it jumps up when he, uh, she would say he, he's the one who took me bear hunting. wow. Yeah. He's a, he's probably one of the most famous bow hunters in America today, probably in the world actually.

Speaker 1:          01:58:55       He's a legit bowhunter. He makes his living doing that. And he's a very famous because of the very ethical though he does not shoot anything. He does not eat everything he shoots. He eats. And I think that's where, um, that's where I have an issue with this, this, this africa thing. But where it gets weird is that those animals, many of them were on the verge of extinction, but now they are, they're in very high numbers. The reason being is that they're in these events operation. So it's such a catch 22. On one hand they were on the verge of extinction and another hand. Now they have these high populations and they're super healthy, but they only exist as a commodity to be hunted down. I mean, in the way they're doing it was like, it was a waterhole and there's like 100 animals in front of waterhole. And these people Just sit there and they just shoot one. They'll look what I did on my hun. Like, is that even a hunt? You're in a park. I mean, you're in a fenced in for like someone's yard. You're not tracking.

Speaker 1:          01:59:52       You're not only not tracking those animals, they're never going to leave and go 100 miles away to a different place. And then, you know, go across the river to mule deer. They, they discovered that mule deer in America. This is a really recent discovery. They had no idea how far they migrate, but they migrate as much as 150 miles in a year. One hundred and 50 miles is a lot of walking man for a deer that's like here to fucking san diego for a deer, you know? And they're just starting to understand their migratory patterns. And that's. But that's a wIld animal. Now if you, that's what I consider a fair chase, right? You go out hunting, you find a mule deer that's walking 150 miles, you figured out where they're going to be and you know, and then stalk them and get into a good position and shoot them and eat them.

Speaker 1:          02:00:40       So about as fair and ethical way as you can acquire your own meat if you're going all the way to africa and you're not even going to eat that animal. And he just kinda like stuff it and stick it on your wall to let everybody know how billy bad ass you are. That's weird man. That's weird aspect of human beings that we would even consider that to be a form of recreation, you know, and people go, well, hey, it's totally legal and well hey, there's nothing, you know, the, the, the money goes to conservation and I guess it does in a way. I guess it does. It does go to keep these animals alive so they can keep killing them. It's weird. It's very weird. So you have also a paleo Guy. Well, you know what, that whole paleo thing, I don't like that term paleo because the term is been debunked by science and you talked about like what people did or did not eat.

Speaker 1:          02:01:31       I think that natural foods are more easily digestible. I try to stay aWay from bread as much as possible. Although I do. I have started eating more sprouted bread recently, like a csi type bread. I feel like my body digest that more easily. I think it's a little healthier. I keep away from white flour and pastas and things along those lines and I try to avoid processed foods as much as possible and sugar as much as possible. So in that sense, yeah, I eat a lot of vegetables. I eat a lot of protein, animal protein, fish and things along those lines, but I just think I'm just real. I noticed because I work out so much and because I, I do athletics where you sort of measure your progress, whether it's my workout routines like strength and conditioning routines or martial arts. I kind of see what I'm on and when I'm off and I can anecdotally or directly correlate that between my to my diet and I find that when I take supplements and I make sure that I have plenty of vitamins and plenty of green leafy vegetables, that's one of the most important ones I think, and healthy proteins.

Speaker 1:          02:02:34       So in that sense I, I eat along the lines that allow those paleo guys eat

Speaker 5:          02:02:37       great. You know, I, I, when I used to be a very competitive soccer player, I was grossly underweight my whole life. I mean one slash 25, 30 pounds, four percent body fat just from running all the time, reading all the time, training. I even found some marathons. The day that I stopped training was this sort of pernicious and insidious weight gain. It wasn't sort of, you saw me one one year, I was 125 in the next year I was one eight. It was always four, five, eight pounds a year. And then one day, eIght, nine years later, I get on this kid and I'm tipping to 100 and the most, I got up to fIfty two, I'm five foot six, 2:58. Whoa, you're heavyweight. Exactly. And now I've lost about 25, 30 pounds, but still, even now, I mean I'm over 200 pounds. And one of the things that I've, that I've been doing is, uh, eating, as you said, a lot of vegetables and a lot of protein, staying away from all the starchy stuff. And I'm using my fitness pal.com. Do you know this thing, this calorie counting program? It's part of this whole quantify yourself. So basically my, I have to give credit to my wife. She, she literally counts every single calorie that goes into my body after basically 1400 calories in a day, uh, including exercise and so on. And so as long as I hit 1400 calories net that day and I've lost so far, 25 pounds and maybe three months. So that's amazing. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:04:03       Great. Number 25 pounds in three years.

Speaker 5:          02:04:05       Yeah, I mean, now it's not totally fast too. That's good. Yeah. Yeah. I've now it's getting a bit rough. I can't seem to break the next sort of hump. What do you do for exercise? So I, I'm, I'm a cardio guy, so maybe, I don't know. Maybe you'll, you'll, you'll guide me in better ways. So I just do tons of cardio so it could be I run on the treadmill or I do stationary bike or I do elliptical. I usually try to average between 45 minutes to an hour of cardio.

Speaker 1:          02:04:29       Right? No, no doubt about it. And you know, there's nothing better than having a good gas tank and having a healthy heart. But I'm one of the things that burns the most is muscle and the more muscle that you can put on your body, the stronger you can make yourself. It's kind of strange, but you get leaner. Yeah. Your metabolism goes up. So yeah. Yeah. And I just find, I just feel better when I'm stronger, my body works better. I liked the way it feels better and I think that I can eat more. You know, I, I'm a pig, I like eating, but I'm pretty lean for someone who eats as much as i eat. I have you ever seen me eat? People freak out, like, especially like after comedy shows, I'll do like two shows in a night and I'll have two entrees and a salad and an appetizer to the point where waitresses think I'm joking and I'm like, nope, I'm serious.

Speaker 1:          02:05:14       I'm going to eat all that too. Wow. I eat a lot of food. But um, and I love it. So the way I make sure that I stay lean is I do a lot of exercise and a lot of weightlifting. I think that weightlifting by weight lifting, I'm not doing a lot of the traditional stuff like bench pressing and most of the stuff I do is full body exercises, kettlebells, things along those lines. But when I do that, all that intense strain that's not available through cardio cardio, you could do sprinting and you can really get your heart rate up and really get exhausted. You certainly burn off a lot of calories, but that intense strain up fucking, that's what makes bone density. That's what makes your tendons and the attendance stronger, muscle density strong, more thick, and I think that also helps your calorie consumption. That's cool.

Speaker 5:          02:05:59       Speaking of comedians, I just, because very organic what's going on. I just hired a postdoc who's claim to fame so far until he gets into my research program was he was studying the evolutionary roots of humor. Oh, that's interesting. And so what he basically looked at is umer as a sexually select that trait as a proxy for intelligence. And so with his former doctoral supervisor who's a well known evolution psychologists, they would go into comedy clubs and a rate people's impressions of how funny the comedian is, and then we administer iq test to them and it turns out that funnier people are actually smarter people. And so when women say, you know, I'd love, you know, they always say, I want a guy with a sense of humor. I want a guy who makes me laugh. Whether effectively saying as a, as a proxy measure is I want the guy who's intelligence because intelligence is a heritable trait.

Speaker 1:          02:07:00       Interesting. But I bet that's wrong. Here's why that's wrong. I know my, my favorite comedian of all time is my friend joey diaz, I think he's the funniest guy that's ever lived and uh, he is a very smart guy as far as like street smarts, wisdom and he knows a lot about life. If you gave him a fucking iq test though, he might barely beat a chimp. Right? So I think what you're basically saying is that iq might not be the way to measure intelligence, but what, but you are admitting that he is probably very intelligent and he's most certainly very. So then that's

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       supporting the general theory. Oh, it's the general theories on. I just think that iq intelligence doesn't matter. your social intelligence. He's very socially intelligent. Like he spots like he's a predator in some ways. Like he spots like the weakness the person has and is with this motherFucker with his goofy. He'll find out the one thing about you, oh yeah, that's not what you're thinking. You know, he'll, he'll find the one thing that, you know, you're trying to pretend you're not, but you truly are. And it'll like illuminated like glowing thing here. This guy is actually a, this is actually have that. He's lying about this. Most certainly know there's a study that was done with ceos and the number one thing that they all had in common other than on average being taller than the norm ceos and taller than the noise there. I fascinated there I think six foot two or some.

Speaker 3:          02:08:25       Some of them, I can't remember exactly the number a is that they had very high social intelligence. Yeah, it makes sense. It makes sense, right? If you're an operating officer, you're trying to keep everybody in line. There's a lot of social intelligence required to do that, to manage a giant group of people and keep everybody happy and you know, in foster morale and yeah, there's a lot involved in that. Here'S an interesting one. A number. Earlier we were talking about, uh, you know, how these hollywood types are lying to themselves and the privacy of their bedrooms. How we brought that back up. Again, there's more to talk about that. you're gonna like this one. So I've often wondered whether they believe the hype that they say. In other words, when somebody is posing in this way, do you, do they truly kind of internalized this or not?

Speaker 3:          02:09:13       There's a fantastic evolutionary theory that looks at the evolutionary roots of self deception and other words. Why is it that we are so good at self deceiving ourselves? This is by a guy named by name of robert trevors, phenomenological biologist, and he proposed the theory that I think is brilliant in its simplicity and then what I usually do is to demonstrate the phenomenon. I go to a television shoW like seinfeld to find a manifestation of that phenomenon, which I'll talk about In a sec. So he says that one of the biggest dangers that we face as humans is to navigate all of these social threats in our environment. Right? So I'm trying to manipulate you while you're trying to read me to see my manipulative intent. That's called machIavellian intelligence or social intelligence. So one of the ways that I could fool you without you picking up that I am fooling you is if any visual cue in my, in my face that would signal that I am lying, I would shut it off the way you, because then you can't read that. And the way you do that is by deceiving yourself. In other words, if you understand what I'm saying, yes, I want to lie to you. I want to deceive you. I want to make you do a. But you're going to be looking at me to see whether there is any visual

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       signals that shows that I'm lying. If I could suppress those by first lying to myself, then you can't pick up that online. So then, so there's a show on seinfeld and I said, how can I demonstrate this to make a sort of more sexy in my book? So there's a short on seinfeld where george castanza, who was kind of the licit, this devious guy, uh, is, is trying to teach jerry how to be a better liar. And one day as he's about to leave his apartment, he looks at him. He Says, remember jerry, it's not a lie if you believe it, and I said, that's it. That's exactly the evolutionary roots of self deception. Right? So you the evolutionary theories everywhere, man. It explains everything. I certainly do.

Speaker 1:          02:11:16       I think you're correct in that. I think there's definitely something there, but I can also offer some unique insight as to the celebrity thing, what it what it is, because I've been a part of it and I've also experienced it myself. I've experienced mY own self deception on my own ego swelling, like in an unnatural way. It's because of the environment that you're constantly enter the data that you're getting, the data that you're getting. If you're a star. I've seen now I'm a nice person, but I, I've seen people get shows and become these fucking ruthless dictators like people that have sitcoms or shows that revolved entirely around them. I got like a, not seinfeld, he's supposedly a very nice guy, but like there's this famous story of brett butler's from that show, grace under fire about what a useless monster she became when she was on the show.

Speaker 1:          02:12:06       Granted substance abuse was in there as well, which I think may also, you know, not just because of the fact that she'd probably have addictive tendencies to begin with. A lot of comedians tend to be impulsive and a lot of them had tend to have addiction issues as well. I'm sure that played into it as well, but also the pressure of being the one to pressure of being this one person where when brett butler shows up on the set, everyone has a coffee for. There's a script, we get anything. Bret, they're all treading lightly, you know, they're all like worried constantly that she's going to be upset at them. So their data, the data that a person like a brett butler or some star has is that they are special. That's all the data they're getting. The data, the data that someone who has, you know, someone who's not attractive, they're, they're the only data, like a lot of data that comes from a person who is not physically attracted.

Speaker 1:          02:12:59       It'S like, well, I found out that I can get people to like me if I make them laugh, so I'm going to develop a good sense of humor because my nose isn't getting any smaller. My ears aren't getting any little or I'm not getting any taller. I'm fucking not losing any weight, so let me just do. Let me just become funny. And then you know, you see a lot of funny guys that are my friends that are not good looking at all, but have beautiful girlfriends. Like what does that from? Well, they figured out the one thing that they do have that they can find that attractive, that data that these actors and these people that get, that are famous, they're getting

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       love and they're getting love from people that don't know them. They only know their work. They only know this thing that they've pretended to be in a movie where there were a superhero or in this thing where they were a doctor and that show where they were. You know, they always had the right answer and they were on top of things. How many people that we've seen in movies that we thought were like really smart, intelligent people? Then you see them in an interview. You go, oh, he's a fucking idiot. He's an idiot. He's playing a role right there. Their data that they get is completely unnatural. That environment Where you, for whatever reason, they decide that you're going to be the guy they put you in this thing. They project you on a screen that's 60 feet wide. Every time you talk, the words that come out of your mouth were carefully constructed by a team of writers and they labored over those words for weeks and weeks.

Speaker 3:          02:14:20       There's music playing. I mean it's amazing exhaust, so that environment is so completely unnatural. The data that they get because of that is so unnatural. When brad pitt shows up at a some awards party or something like that and he goes down the red carpet and people fucking go bananas and scream, he handles it remarkably well for someone who's in that scenario because that is a completely unnatural scenario and must be insanely difficult to maintain objectivity and that's in that situation. So that has to be taken into account. Just the data that those people get is so different from the data that a guy who is working at a camera shop gets a guy that was a normal person and normal life that the data that they get is when they interact with people, people judge them based on their appearance, how they talk, what their background is.

Speaker 3:          02:15:11       They start communicating, they gather up data. When you see tom cruise or brad pitt, like you automatically like them. You automatically have all this attached to them and that's a totally unnatural world to live in. There is actually some studies that have looked at Why is it that people love celebrities so much and the argument is that it's because it's tricking our ancestral brain, right? You're coming into my television, a screen every day on news radio. I actually, you now become part of my what's called, want dunbar numbers on it for $1,500. Very nice. So you know joe rogan. I know this guy. I mean I remember when my kid was blogged, joe rogan, joe, joe. I know joe rogan. And so I think what ends up happening is that since we obviously didn't evolve in an environment where to televisions, but I now feel so intimately connected to you, that barrier is removed.

Speaker 3:          02:16:06       Yeah. It gets even weirder when you do something like this podcast because it's even more intimate because we're in people's ears were an earbuds. I'm inside your head. I'm talking to you right now. Maybe you're on a treadmill, maybe you're on a plane, maybe you're sitting on the subway by my books. It's books, a member, those subliminal things that, those work, those things like buy popcorn. Remember those things. flash in the movie, not famous sort of popcorn and coke. Apparently the, the, I don't know the exact story, but I think apparently the company that commissioned that study, uh, maybe did some massaging with. I had a group of undergraduate students do a similar project. And one of my courses, what they found is that if you put, let's say by crush or buy a big mac, it's not specifically the desire to buy that product that increased.

Speaker 3:          02:16:58       But rather your hunger and your thirst increased somewhat. I mean it didn't increase your likelihood of saying, yes, I'd like to buy a big mac, but when they were asked post the subliminal thing, are you hungry than the subliminal cue would affect their hunger and their thirst but not to the specific product. So the evidence is equivocal, so there's a little something in there like if you see somebody eating a piece of cake on tv and it looks awesome, you do that or like that. And that's real. Yeah, exactly. So that is kind of a subliminal message or is that not to limit because it's conscious. It's has to be below my conscious awareness for it to be subliminal. Do you remember those things? They used to sell. I don't think they have them anymore, but they used to be cds or audio tapes and you would hear like the sound of the ocean or something like that.

Speaker 3:          02:17:45       But then behind the smoking a message for succession and smoking so well I don't know if those work because I don't think they are on the market anymore. I know. I think the market has spoken. Yeah, they were. They were quite popular for awhile. You hear like. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Somewhere in there apparently was like, lose weight. Stop eating cheetos. Correct. Why isn't that? Doesn't scientology have a similar thing with getting the clear state or something? I had a neighbor, it was poor bastard. There was a piece of property that he wanted to buy and I found out he was a scientologist because this conversation he wanted to buy this piece of property and I said, yeah, this is right. It was right next to his house. I said, would you build on it? And he was like, well, you know, I don't, I can't even buy it right now because my wife was about to go clear, like, what does that mean?

Speaker 3:          02:18:34       You know, I didn't know what it meant. And he goes, well, you know, were scientologists. So and then so, you know, I tried to be as objective as possible and that kind of sorta started asking them like, what does that mean? He was telling me that she will no longer be influenced by any outside stimuli, any outside influence, any outside suggestions and that she will be able to go through this world without being affected by negative anything and anybody yelling at her, anybody insulting or they will no longer get in there, but it costs $50,000. That that's, that's the ringer. And then remember, I was going like, what is this? What happens? And he was explaining that, that she goes through the ceremony and like, that costs 50 grand. Why does it cost us 50 grand? So I don't know. It's just, uh, you know, it's worth it. Fucking poor bastard. Now why is it that so many people since you're in that industry, is it that it

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       is particularly accepted within the hollywood crowd crowd question. I've only met a few. I've only met a few legit scientologists and one thing that they radiate. It's this weird sort of positive energy, this alien, artificial positive energy that's very difficult to put your finger on. Like, hey, nice to meet you man. That's amazing. So you deal in evolutionary psychology as it applies to marketing. Amazing stuff. I'm like it a lot. Like there's something. It's not like a genuine enthusiasm. It's this weird extra level that's not, but it's almost like you want to follow. I want to see how long you can keep this up. I want to follow you all day. I want to know when the crash is coming. You know, I'm pretty sure that if I followed you around, I'm just guessing, but based on our two hour and a half conversation that if I followed you around, you're pretty much like this all the time.

Speaker 1:          02:20:18       It was you, but when you're talking to a scientologist, you fucking know that this is going to end. You can't keep this up man. It's like if a guy's putting on a fake english accent, I'm talking all day like this is an important time. We got to know that I can't do this forever. No, and this is something that they're doing when they've got this amazing stuff. I love it. Love what you do in like, like, man, you're going to hit the rocks brown. you're going to crash. Something's gonna go wrong. But they are there centers that they have in la, one of the most interesting ones is they have this anti psychiatry, anti psychiatry center, psychiatry kills and they have this big billboard where the guy's got like shock electric shock therapy, shit on his head, screaming in agony. And what you don't realize when you go to that is that it's a scientology front.

Speaker 1:          02:21:06       I mean, he'd go in there and they, they, you know, they get you hooked on dianetics. Wow. The story of this guy is quite amazing. He's amazing, amazingly bad, too. Amazingly bad writer. And the fact that he openly spoke about creating your own religion, that if you want to have real power and real money, you need to make your own religion. And then made his own religion and the books are fucking atrocious. His movie, battlefield earth. Have you ever seen the john travolta movie? No. Oh my god. We were talking about it last week. My friend elizA slessinger and I were laughing about it. It's a insanely bad movie with john travolta, who's in more of a monster giant alien guy and it's him. And um, what's the fucking dudes name with the lazy eye? The black guy, a forest whitaker, forest forest whitaker's in it too.

Speaker 1:          02:21:59       I don't think he's the scientologists, but he's, he's an alien the in this movie because you'd be amazed at how many scientologists there are high level people and you start like looking like weird ones. Like back the singer back is this juliette lewis is like, as you go down the list of people that are actual scientologists is. It's pretty extensive. I think what it provides them is a scaffolding for, I think hollywood and the idea of being and most notably actors, because acting itself is one of the most unstable professions. You have to be chosen. Could you. I mean, what you do is based entirely on the merits of your work. What you do is based on entirely on your education, your qualifications, the, your, your, and the data that you've provided and the writing that you've done based on that data. It's all really rock solid stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:22:51       So I'll right in front of you, despite the fact that the ideologues attack you and the fucking politically correct knuckleheads will go after you. What you're doing is, you know, it's all based on the merits of your work. What an actor is doing is trying so desperately to get other people to accept them and choose them. And it's very weird. It's fleeting. It's not just fleeting, it's so. It's so weird that they don't have their own. It's very rare that you talk to actors and they have their own opinions, right? It's like what they have is this sort of conglomeration of opinions that they've sort of subscribe to because they believe that this is going to ingratiate them with the overlords of hollywood. Right? So everyone has got damn politically correct. Everyone's driving a fucking prius, everyone's voting democrat. You know, everyone is wearing pink ribbons when it's the appropriate time because it's breast cancer awareness. Hashtag bring our girls home.

Speaker 1:          02:23:45       Hashtag yes. All Women. You better fucking have that shit. You better have a good quote about it. Hashtag hashtag go fuck yourself. So they all, they all get up. They become a part of this sort of really unstable and to be, to be fame fair to someone who wants to be an actor in the first place, oftentimes you're incredibly unstable at first, uh, the original you before you get to hollywood, like, why do you want to be an actor? Because you want to be super special, not just regular special. You want to be, you want to be the guy. I actually wanted to ask you about this because my theory is that very few actors want to be actors because of the love of the craft. I Mean, yes, there's opera opportunity and robert deniro who really do this because, you know, they're just, they're real artists, but most people are really looking for the extrinsic brooks.

Speaker 1:          02:24:33       Right. It's really cool for me to walk around and people throwing themselves off balconies when I, when I make an appearance, right? Yeah. To make tons of money. So would, would you agree that that's true? I mean, is that it's a sickness. It's, you know, the, the, there's a lot of people they see like a guy like uh, go back to brad pitt for instance, they see the love that brad pitt gets. They want to be like him and what's the best way to be like him to do what he does. And so what does he do? He acts. How hard is that? It's just Pretending I'm going to get an acting, you know, they just want, they have a hole in their soul. They need to fill up with other people's attention and almost all of them that are like really extremely successful had some fucking wacky childhood.

Speaker 1:          02:25:09       For me personally, I had a very bad childhood. It was not good, you know, and because of that bad child, it wasn't the worst. I have friends that have way worse childhoods, but it was enough to create a deficit that I had this burning desire to fill in, to show that I wasn't a loser. Right. You know, there wasn't, there wasn't this, this child who is ignored and treated like shit that I wasn't that, that I'll show you, you know, and that I'll show you is what sort of getting fame by becoming or being graded athletics. I mean that's what initially led me to fighting. That's what initially led me to comedy. It wasn't as much I'll get fame is I'll show you like I'm going to get great at something. And then somewhere along the line I started acting. It was. But that was completely by accident.

Speaker 1:          02:25:54       They, I never, yeah, never taken any acting classes or anything like that. I just got a development deal because of standup comedy and I took a handful of private one-on-one acting classes with a crazy person. Oh, This crazy lady who was constantly trying to get me to. If I did get a show to cast her as my mother working her way in. Oh, so gross. She conversations that I had with this lady was so brutal and it sort of like, it was one of the first interactions that I had ever had with someone who has deep, deep in the acting world and the business and I got to be around some of these people that were also taking her classes. I'm like, you people are fucking grills. There's something gross about the just the disingenuous behavior. Yeah, but I, again, as we said, I think it all boils down to like what is that world?

Speaker 1:          02:26:46       So are many of your personal friends in the industry or are they more in fighting or. Most of them are comedians. I'm mostly. My good friends are stand up comics because standup comics is like. And the other ones are martial artists. Those, those two worlds are there as solid as he can get. Like if you're not funny, no one laughs. If you don't know how to fight, you're going to get your ass kicked, if you. You know what I mean? Even if you don't know, if you don't know jujitsu, someone's going to strangle you. If you, you know, these were all rock solid world. There's no no getting around them where things get weird and airy. Fairy is when you're pretending to be a superhero, you know, or you're pretending to be a. Just think it's a. It's an unnatural position to be in and for human beings as you were saying, we have this evolutionary trait where we look at successful behavior.

Speaker 1:          02:27:32       We want to emulate it. Well, if you find the guy who's the head of the tribe, who's got the scars and the wisdom, that's the guy that you want to pay attention to because you can learn from other people's mistakes and he shows wisdom. You can emulate his behavior and you can become successful. Well, when someone is on tv and slash or in a movie theater in their heads for 60 feet tall and they're. Everything they're saying is perfect, you want to be them. You know, you want to follow them. you want to worship them because they seem to be exhibiting this evolutionary thing. And also think that the media itself, whether it's music or whether it's movies and television, there, there's an inescapable quality to being on film that is unavoidable and some very strange way and that your body's not designed to absorb.

Speaker 1:          02:28:21       Your body is not designed to absorb movies. Your body's absorbed, designed to absorb the wisdom of the natural world. Like the wisdom of, you know, that guy got bitten by a is to have the tall grass. You know, it's real fucking simple. You know, like, oh, he went in the river and he drowned or don't go in the river. You know, all these lessons we learned from the natural world. All these things that we see that exist in the material world that's in front of us. But when this world is all of a sudden been changed and now you're looking at dragons and you're looking at the spaceships and fucking lightning bolts and all these things that are taking place on a screen that aren't real, the whole thing gets very squirrely in our minds. We don't know what to do with it. So do you ever get blow backs?

Speaker 1:          02:29:03       As we were talking about blowback about being, you get blowback from people in the industry for speaking so critically of the hollywood types. They're scared, especially actors, terrified to have an opinion on anything. They opinion on someone shitting on actors because the problem is then it would be exposed. People would start examining, well, let's examine your behalf. Let's examine what actors really what's examined. Some of the things you said know they probably get mad. Fuck him, but I'm not going to say it. You know, you won't get access on this show. I've had actors on the show. There's not all actors. It's like saying. I mean all of a lot of comedians are fucked up, but it's not all comedians. A lot of fighters are fucked up, but not all of them. I mean there's a lot of actors that are really nice and I've done some, like I've done movies with people like rosario dawson who's beautiful and famous.

Speaker 1:          02:29:47       She's about as nice and normal as you're ever going to be around. She's so cool. Like when you're around her, you would never believe in a million years that she's famous. She seems completely unaffected by whatever mechanism. I don't know how she got to fake modest. She's totally normal, which I wish I had a video of her playing with my daughter when my daughter was two. It was hilarious. She was grabbing her and like stuffing her whole hand or mouth. My daughter would scream laughing and she kept doing it again. It was so funny. She's really funny. My daughter was crying at the monster outside of the werewolf. Sorry man. I should've worn you. I didn't know you got to bring kids some motherfucker. I know there's a lot of nice people that are actors, like there's a lot of nice people. I'm sure they do all sorts of things.

Speaker 1:          02:30:31       I know a lot of dudes that are in special forces that are nice as hell. Right. And they've killed folks. You know? It'S like there's a lot of nice people. I got a last year when we came to California. We come here every year to vacation. I don't know if you knew it was the wrong time. Why don't you come to winteR? You live in montreal? We. I was at uc irvine for a couple years and then headed back to montreal and I've been trying to get back to California that winter is a motherfucker up there. What? You had been to montreal. Oh yeah, many times. Yeah. Well shaw sent piano I guess. Yeah, well I grew up in boston and I used to do comedy at the montreal comedy festival every year. Oh, there you go. Yeah. Which is happening soon. I guess every summer I used to go. I started going up there and I think 92, so. Oh cool. So you were saying about the special forces. So we, you know, we always hang out at one of the beaches. We meet people, we chat, you know, we were very friendly and so met a guy who's,

Speaker 5:          02:31:20       he's become now a very good friend, a fbi special agent whose job it is to tailgate all of these muslim extremists around uc irvine area won't tailgate them. Well, yeah. I'm not going to be upset that I said, well I have no worries. Uh, so yeah. So, uh, so he's, he's, he's told me some unbelievable stories of, and he, he too, I mean, he was an fbi agent who has been under a lot of pressure to do the politically correct thing, right as you probably know that you're not supposed to say islamic extremists or islam or this or that. And so when he hears me in some of my discourse, he finds it quite liberating because here's a guy who was sort of whose job it is to protect us from some of these dangers who faces some of the politically correct shackles that we've been talking about.

Speaker 1:          02:32:11       We're all To our mutual friend sam harris. Yes. Has had an incredible amount of blow back in his honest and objective assessment of muslim extreme extremists credible. The muslim extremists that he's documented that he is put on his blog. Like he had this thing where he was saying like, um, there's, there's a, there's a video of this guy who's speaking. Um, I forget what country he's in, but he's speaking in english to this group of islamic people. And he's talking about the differences between what people think of them as radical islam and what is just islam. Right? And he starts talking about, he goes, how many of you believe in the works of the koran, in the word of the koran, and in how many of you follow it? And they all raised their hand. How many of you believe that the word of god is the best way to deal with homosexuals and that whatever the koran says, whether they it says they should be stoned to death, that this is the word of god and this is the.

Speaker 1:          02:33:12       And they don't raise their hand. And like he goes into this thing about how many of you think that women should be silent and then they should. You should listen to their man because this is what god has said. And they all raised their hand and he's like, see, this is, this is not radical islam. This is just islam. So all these people that say, oh, is so radical, the radical islam. And like he doesn't even realize that he's demonstrating radical islam. Exactly. He's demonstrating sam harris got so much fucking hate just for putting this video up. I saw all these people. Oh, I see what you're doing. Shielding your, his islamophobic with one person and it's your islamophobia. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:33:48       What's astonishing is that you know, he, he is a true liberal. Yes. And yet he is painted to be some hate monger.

Speaker 1:          02:33:56       Well, he also gets painted that way because it's perceived that he supports war because he wants to, to suppress this aspect of, of humanity. And why is it? Well, it's because it's not over here yet. If it was over here, it was invading and you were getting suicide bombs on a daily basis, you would have a real issue with it too.

Speaker 5:          02:34:14       I'll tell you a great story. Uh, those lines. A woman approached me who was used to be a friend. Now she no longer is a friend. You'll know by the end of the story why she said, you know, you know a lot about this issue. God, you grew up in the region. Uh, what is the position on islam regarding jews? Okay. Well, I mean we escaped Lebanon because we were going to be executed. Okay, bye. It wasn't by the amish. Okay. Uh, so I said, you know what, rather than kind of go into a whole treaties, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to share with you a montage of a moms from around the world. So this is not the culture specific. There's the indonesian and malaysian, Kuwait, the yemeni. So these are at their sermons. This is at the mosque where they are preaching what should be done to the jews.

Speaker 5:          02:35:00       And one of the particular, uh, iSlam's was showing images of the nazis bulldozing a skeleton's into the ditches and he was lamenting to god, why? God, why didn't you give us the pleasure of exterminating those jewish routes? Why do you hate us so much? Jewish rats have some version of that. Right? So maybe it was even by that standard was diabolical. So I share with her the link and I make, I made absolutely no interpretation is right. I wasn't saying it's good, it's bad. I just shared the link. Now she's a jewish woman whose grandparents I can't remember on which side had had suffered in the holocaust. She her response back to me, well, in you sharing this video, you're exhibiting the same extremism so so when your moral compass is so broken that the guy who shares a video in response to a question that you asked me is no different than the people who are generating the content in the video. We're doomed. We need a better term for political correctness

Speaker 1:          02:36:06       because that's even more extreme than political correctness. This denial of reality based on your own ideology and that's what it is. It's just this crazy sickness that in people who consider themselves intelligent, intellectual, progressive, open minded, these are the people that exhibit this ridiculous train

Speaker 5:          02:36:23       because I think they just have this instinct that to criticize an other is gauche is wrong, especially when that other is their religious views, but

Speaker 1:          02:36:34       is that true because they have no problem criticizing the heck public and senator who believes in creationism and wants to teach it in school. They're fucking hate to the end of time about that fool. That's true, but if it's some in mom who thinks that, you know, women should cover themselves up like they look like jabba the hut or what was the boba fett, whichever one, whatever it is, please direct your hate mail to joe rogan. Come coming, bringing on benches. It's silliness. It's my silliness is not. I almost have more disdain for the people that are progressive that have an issue with someone criticizing this. Then I do the people that were brainwashed and ingrained with religion because these, the people that are supposedly intellectuals are supposedly responsible for guiding the thought of the young people, the people that are supposed to be the folks that are the ones that are the curators of these ideas, the ones that are the ones who are teaching children in school. There's these are the wise ones who are professionally intelligent. You're supposed to be professionally objective professionally wise and you have this ridiculous notion because of the environment that we live in, where this politically correct, whatever you wanna call it, ideology has has gotten so infected. It's such a bizarre computer virus of the mind blow the king of these, these guys. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:37:58       Although it has nothing to do with islam as a noam chomsky. I don't know if you know much about. Sure. Yeah. I mean, I, I jokingly play a game called the six degrees of separation of noam chomsky. So I give you a calamity and in six causal links, you have to link it back to why the us is evil. So, you know, an, a, an amazonian frog died in six causal links or less. You have to tell me why it is the fault of the us military industrial complex as to why that frog that because he used the whole world through very, very, uh, you know, a myopic lens, right? A hamas is nice. Uh, Israel is a evil apartheid, racist state, and you think this is a jewish guy who was spewing this from his, uh, safety of his confines in mit office. Now I grew up in that world. I promise you they're not going to take too kindly to you, uh, when the lights are off. And so it's just, it really is amazing to kind of understand, understand the schizophrenia position or for example, queers for palestine is another one, right?

Speaker 1:          02:39:04       Palestine. Yeah, that's, that's a huge movement. I need a t shirt. Queers for palestine t show. It's fine if they have a cafe press. Which area in the middle east can you be

Speaker 5:          02:39:17       opened and assume your sexual orientation? It's an Israel. Yes. Yet what's going to happen to you in some of those other areas is not going to be very pretty, and yet these people are able to completely disassociate from that reality. It's like uncle tom's. Right, right. It's kind of along those lines, I suppose

Speaker 1:          02:39:36       a way that. Yeah, the, the idea that for whatever reason, this one religion is the one that you're not supposed to criticize. I don't understand how that happened. I wonder if it's connected in some way to the suppression of the people that live in these places. Where are natural resources is being stolen by the war machine, which is undeniable, undeniable. What's going on in Iraq or Afghanistan? How much of it, how much of the hustle has to do with the natural resources, whether they be the poppy fields, whether it be the minerals in Afghanistan, whether it's the oil in Iraq, the undeniable that these people are being sure for sure they're are subject to the war machine that's coming in to steal the resources. Right, and that, that that's, that's something that people are aware of and you see these images of these people and these islamic countries that are dying, they're getting bombed on and and also the dea humanism that they're subjected to by a lot of people that are trying to justify this, these wars, that, that is the only thing that makes sense to me. And also the fact that this has happened over the course of since 2001. This is when this anti islamophobia notion has been really, really pushed harder and harder.

Speaker 5:          02:40:51       Well, I think it's also because that's the way that I demonstrate how tolerant and progressive I am by showing that I am not going to lump everybody with those crazy nine slash 11 people. And so again, it's part of that progressive posing a no ideology, no belief system is free from mockery from criticism. And the quicker we find that out and the quicker we fixed this problem, the better we'll be off.

Speaker 1:          02:41:18       Do you think that that's possible? I mean this is the internet in this is. This is where it gets really weird. His internet is supposedly where the ideas come out. You know what I mean? This is the, the age of information. This is where it's all on the table. So you're saying is it, is it is going to be possible to suppress criticisms of islam for much longer? Yeah. Is it going to be possible to keep up this ridiculous facade?

Speaker 5:          02:41:41       Well, I think, I think one of the ways that you suppress it is by creating an ethos of self censorship. So, so if I open up my laptop and I can write on my psychology today, blog, the 3 million people, I have a real clear choice to make that day. Am I going to write something that can bring heat to my young children? And then I have to decide whether I'm willing to do that or not. Now the fact that I've already engaged in that calculus in that calculation suggests that we are the canaries singing in the coal mine. And so I think we have to be in an environment where we don't engage in this type of self censorship. So, so I think we're definitely down the wrong road. I think many academics, uh, privately will speak about these issues very openly with me, but we'll never even so far as go as to like something on facebook less they will be.

Speaker 1:          02:42:39       I found out so crazy. You got to worry about your standing. You gotta worry about your public standing gotta worry about your Job. You gotta work. That's more people to be self sufficient. You know, less to tHink about in that regard. But when you're an educator, how can you be? in one sense, you have tenure. That kind of helps a lot. But tenure creates a lot of hubris. There's a lot of guys who have tenure that also become untouchable and they force feed their students their ideas. Apologies.

Speaker 5:          02:43:06       Yeah, absolutely. And actually I wrote an article on my psychology today blog, what I was talking about, the necessity for tenure,

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       but also its potential for misuse, right? Because you do get an incredible amount of deadwood with tenure. Right. Do you foresee a time where universities won't be the main source of education that was somehow or another to be taken care of online? That's a good question. I mean, right now there's a development of. Have you heard of moocs are. No. Moocs are. I know joey diaz calls moocs or fucking move over here. Oh, he had dumb. Okay. The ball. Hey, right here. A mooka know a moocs are a massive online. I can't remember the rest of the day. These are courses that are often times offered under the auspices of a university, but they're free courses where people can massively registered. You have a teaching a course, 100,000 people. Mit does that. Mit does that as a whole lot. Actually. I tried to to hook up with these guys called coursera that organizes a portal for this, but they don't have a contract with concordia and it has to be between a university and the organization for it to fly.

Speaker 3:          02:44:17       Uh, so I do see a potential eventually for sort of a more democratization of knowledge, but I don't suspect that we're going to lose the university anytime soon. This is the social aspect of it. That's so interesting. You know, people go away and the party and they have fun. They find themselves in Canada though. Yeah, it's interesting. [inaudible] I've studied both in the us and in Canada. A yes part of my study. And so this greek system going away to college, not being close to your parents, uh, uh, the drinking games, that's very much, much more so of an american right of passage then it is a canadian. Most canadian students end up going to the school that is physically closest to them. That's interesting. Is that because it's so paid for by the government. So you've got. You got it. So in Canada you don't have historically.

Speaker 3:          02:45:05       I mean now some programs are getting a bit more privatized, but historically everything is big brother, so there isn't this huge hierarchy of universities, the harvard and then whatever and all schools are public and so yes, mcgill university is more famous than some other kenyan university, but on average all canadian schools are quite good and you have about 40 universities and so there's really no point in choosing between them and going across the country. In the us you have 3000 colleges and universities. There's wildly varying on everything in terms of price, in terms of quality. And so I think that's what makes it a bit more exciting to choose and pick. But then Canada, they're all good. That's interesting. And in the United States they also have universities that cater specifically to religious ideas too. Like the, what was the one that, that, uh, someone got in trouble for during one of the elections for taking support from and that they wouldn't allow interracial couples. Remember that? Brigham young. Was it bringing me up? It might've been bringing me on.

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       I don't, I don't remember which one it was, but if some southern university, and I forget who they were supporting, but it became a big problem with them that they had had become aligned with this university that didn't, didn't allow interracial couples like, whoa, like, you know, at what time the, the real problem with that. Obviously it's racist, but also the varying scales of race. Like is it only pure blood, you know, what are you a fucking vampire? Like, like what if someone is like one slash 16th native american is that, you know, is he interracial dating a blonde woman from Norway. You know, what if the woman is like one eighth, chinese, one corridor, like when do we draw the line and she's half chinese. Like what the fuck? What if she lies about it and said she's eskimo. To think that if only I converted the seventh day adventist, I could be living in southern California.

Speaker 1:          02:47:06       Man, dude, you could've been rocking it and teach bullshit and teach them bullshit in line about jesus. It would have been awesome. Maybe I still might accept them hand. Yeah, you've been tanning. You can tend to montreal to for about three weeks. Montreal, you probably know this joke. We have four seasons, winter, winter, winter and july. It's true. Well, july is pretty awesome though and everybody's very festive. One of the things that I love about any place like Canada or a lot of parts of Canada is that they really appreciate the summertime because of the fact that water so brutal. We oVercame it. That's exactly right. It's the festival sort of city of the world because we're completely cocooned from say end of november till say mid april and so we make up for it. I think it also develops character too. I've talked about los angeles and that a lot of people that are born and raised in los angeles, so like spoiled rich kids that you know also won the lottery.

Speaker 1:          02:47:59       TheY don't realize how easy they've got it. Like the worst the weather gets here, you have to hit a button and turn the aca is the most brutal thing you have to do is use your finger to press a button. Well, I remember when we lived here, when I was at uc irvine one time we were driving on the highway and there was a warning weather advisory because there was going to be 10 minutes of rain and when it rains the the roads dependently become a bit more slippery because of the oil stat. I don't know exactly what it was. I. So I'm thinking, you know, we drive in minus 30 degrees in small stars. TheY have warning advisories when it rains for 10 minutes through. You guys have character. We have none. We're done. I'll give up my character to move to southern California.

Speaker 1:          02:48:41       Well, you've lived a bunch of years up there. You realize that the winners are not worth it. They get, they are brutal. They, especially if you have to go anywhere. If you could work out of your house all winter long and you had a good supply of wood and water and food ready for you and a bear once in a while to shoot. There you go. Then you can stay warm and full. But California, there's pros and cons. The con is obviously that everybody knows about it. And so you've been here, you've been here since 94. Oh, okay. So you've been here for 20 years. Yeah, it's a. But I grew up in boston and also delivered newspapers, so I drove every day, 300, 65 days a year. So snowstorms, everything. One thing is good. I know how to drive in snow. I know to drive real good.

Speaker 1:          02:49:22       Right? Like when the asset and my car kicks out, I don't sweat it at all. Countersteer, it's like instinctive, but you know, it's more pleasurable to live here if you don't have the. I mean, could you break out into the bostonian accent if you want it to? Yeah, I kinda, you know what? I fought once in the bay state games, which was this big olympic festivals when taekwondo was going into the olympics and I won it. So I got interviewed on television. I heard myself on tv. I was like, oh my god, I sound like a fucking idiot. It was, my accent was so strong. Yeah. We've been working, had training for this. I'm like, oh, I didn't realize. I didn't realize how gross it sounded. So I abandoned bandler heart too. I just abandoned it. I mean it comes out every now and then if I have a couple drinks in me here, a little bit of it.

Speaker 1:          02:50:08       Right. But it's a weird accent because I've a little bit of new Jersey to New Jersey. um, man, we're just about out of time.
