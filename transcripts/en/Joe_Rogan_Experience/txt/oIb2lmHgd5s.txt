Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Sure, thank you. Five, four, three, two, one. Boom. And we're live Hawaii in the house. Good to see you. Thanks for doing this. Thanks for him. What a great place to be. A Congressperson the best. You're in paradise.

Speaker 2:          00:00:17       Yeah. It's hard to leave to go to Washington. I'd tell you what,

Speaker 1:          00:00:20       that's one place if it wasn't for the storms and the fact that it's really a volcano as we've seen all too evident just recently. Yeah. I have a friend who goes to the big island every year for Thanksgiving. He convinced me to go two years in a row. It was awesome. I loved it, but then this year I might do. It seems like it's shooting rocks into the sky and a half of it's on fire.

Speaker 2:          00:00:43       Yeah, that. That's been a. that's it. So that's my district. My district in Hawaii covers basically the whole state except for the densely populated urban corridor of Honolulu.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       Oh, so you're lucky you cover everything except the problems bar

Speaker 2:          00:00:58       the city, the city. So no, it's. It's been tough. It's been a tough year because of those folks in the district to Puno at the volcano. We have gone through a few near misses with hurricanes, some big flooding on Kawaii and now we've got another one that's knocking on our door.

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       Yeah, you guys just a, what was it, a level four just passed.

Speaker 2:          00:01:19       It was five. They were expecting it to be kind of the same intensity that Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands saw. So we were really like encouraging everyone to get prepared, getting prepared ourselves, like boarding up all the doors and windows and then, thank God it turned into a tropical storm at the end and had some lot of rain. We still had some flooding, but compared to what it could have been very fortunate.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       And then on top of that, you guys had a false alarm where tax went out to everybody in the island saying that a nuclear missile was headed your way. And this was not a drill. What the hell?

Speaker 2:          00:01:56       Oh my gosh, I was in Washington when that happened. It was a Saturday afternoon ish in dc time, you know, early morning in Hawaii and uh, somebody from Hawaii, he sent me a screen capture of that alert that went out to over a million cell phones across our state saying, uh, you know, a ballistic missile headed towards Hawaii. Seek cover. This is not a good

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       drill. Wow. Yeah. What does that feel like? I mean, until you find out that's not. How long did it take before you found out that it wasn't?

Speaker 2:          00:02:31       So I immediately started thinking, I mean, so many things running through my head. I'm thinking about my parents, my husband, my family, everybody's in Hawaii. Start thinking about what's going on in the state. Is this real? Is it not real? So that was Kinda the first thing. Like I kicked into gear like, okay, let's, let's make sure this is legitimate. I'm the actual threat from North Korea is a very real one. So it could very well be. It was not obvious that this was just a mistake that people should blow off. And that was what I think most of the people in the state understood as they started thinking through what do we do with the last minutes of our lives. So I called. The first person I called was our state adjutant general, who's also the head of our civil defense and the national guard and a called his cell phone.

Speaker 2:          00:03:20       Thank God. He answered the phone and I said, I got this message, what's going on? And he said, uh, it's a false alarm. It was sent out as a mistake. I said, okay, I'm going to blast that out. So I got on twitter and I put that out, just saying, hey, this is not accurate. I forget exactly what I said, but basically this is a false alarm. And then just started getting on the phone, making as many calls as I possibly could. But as I was doing that, I was getting text messages and emails and things from people who were freaking out. Um, as far as Korea from Hawaii, um, it's, it's over 4,000 miles away. That's not very far for a, for an intercontinental ballistic missile. And knowing progressively, just over the six years that I've been in Congress, and this was a major issue, um, that I've been bringing up since I've been there in just raising the alarm bells that North Korea is increasing their capacity and their, their ballistic missile capabilities that put Hawaii closer and closer than reach Hawaii and Alaska particularly.

Speaker 2:          00:04:26       And that's why, you know, and, and after people started getting the word that this was a false alarm, I started hearing from folks who just shared their stories of what they went through. And you know, on the news, they showed the guy who was lowering his daughter down a manhole on the side of the street, his little girl. Oh God. I heard from another guy who said that, you know, I had one kid in town in Honolulu and another kid and why and I over an hour drive. And he literally sat there thinking, how am I going to choose which child I'm going to go and spend the last minutes of my life with? Because you're either driving in one direction or the other. There are so many, so many stories of what happen, guy pushed, clicked on the wrong, uh, on the wrong alert message on his computer screen. That's ultimately what happened. Uh, the one that said, this is a drill. Did he have like no glasses on or something or was it just, there's so many theories and his story has changed a few times and of course there's the subject of major investigations and then after awhile he got fired. He's actually swings and he was wrongfully terminated and almost stuff going on. And

Speaker 1:          00:05:41       if ever there was something you could be fired for, how could you be wrongfully terminated for that mistake? That's my question. To understand the magnitude of your decision. I mean, that is a giant fuck up. Yeah. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          00:05:53       But it, it, you know, I think it, um, it really woke people up. There were clear vulnerabilities in our state alert system that would even allow this, allow one person to have that power to do that is not, it's obviously not good. And so there, there are things that we're working to just to strengthen our civil defense alert system, but also just to bring attention to North Korea and, and make it so that people aren't living under this threat of possibility that that could be a real thing and that alarm could come through your phone and know that you now have around 18 minutes to find good cover or say our final goodbyes.

Speaker 3:          00:06:34       Well, it's so scary because it's such an erratic and dangerous regime. I mean when you see what that guy is already done and the people he's executed, including family members. Yeah. I mean he's a quite a maniac and a legitimate dictator in the old world kind of sense. It's very strange that he's still. I mean you think in the age that we live in that would be very difficult to control the entire country the way that they've controlled North Korea for so long. Yeah. Since the Korean War. But yeah, they still can do it

Speaker 2:          00:07:08       that they are. And I think that while it may be easy to write him off as a maniac, there has also been a very consistent there. There, there has been a consistency throughout the different regimes of the Kim family as they've developed this nuclear, a nuclear missile capability in that they are doing it to protect themselves against regime change, war essentially. And they have said it directly. Um, uh, you know, our, our US foreign policy experts point that out that this is the reason why they're developing this capability because they have seen how, if you look at Libya, for example, when Gaddafi was looking at, you know, building and acquiring nuclear weapons, um, he was doing so also as you know, to protect himself and his regime. And then he made a deal with the United States saying, okay, give up your nuclear weapons a program and we're not going to, you know, don't worry about it. We're not going to touch you. And then of course we know what happened. The U S led this regime change war toppled, Gadhafi and, and North Korea says, okay, so that's what you do when you have, you know, a leader of a country without nuclear weapons to protect themselves.

Speaker 3:          00:08:26       Well, it's also the consequences of that regime change is a failed state and it's more terrifying than even when Gaddafi was controlling. I mean, I'm sure you've seen the, uh, the slave trade videos from their fine. It's insane. It is horrifying. You're watching youtube. Yeah. Right, right.

Speaker 2:          00:08:44       And in our lifetime and that, this, this, um, this failed state has happened as a direct result of our policy. There are failed continuation of these regime change wars that we carry out different parts of the world.

Speaker 3:          00:08:57       Right? It's almost like we don't learn from our mistakes and I don't know what the proper solution is. I mean, do you keep someone like Saddam Hussein or someone like Walmart Kadafi, do you keep them in power and let them still be horrific dictators in evil maniacs or do you step in and cause more damage? I mean, it's almost a lose lose situation.

Speaker 2:          00:09:20       It, it's, yeah, it's not a good situation, but it's where we as the United States need to be pragmatic about the situation and the fact that we live in the world that exists, not some kind of idealistic world that is a fantasy. And then think about how, um, counterproductive our acting as the world's police has been, has proven to be, in example, after example after example. So yes, there are bad people in the world who do horrifying things, but

Speaker 2:          00:09:54       is it really in our place to go in and take action and say, okay, we're going to remove this person and then we're going to put this person in and this is how you're going to govern this country. And, and really acting, acting as the world's police and therefore, and then as a result, as we've seen in Iraq and Libya and now in Syria, the people in those countries are far worse off than they were before. We have an. And it's counterproductive for our interests as well because we have al Qaeda, Isis and other terrorist groups who have been strengthened directly as a result of our policies in these countries.

Speaker 3:          00:10:30       When you talk to people in the intelligence community, what, what did they think, I mean either off the record or on the record, what did they think is the solution for situations like that?

Speaker 2:          00:10:43       Many of them are hesitant to share their own opinion because, especially in the intelligence community, um, their job is to report on what they're hearing, what they're gathering, the Intel that they're bringing in and so on and so forth. But you know what, when you, when you talk with folks who operate in that space, um, the ones who are honest and not trying to further specific agenda or cover somebody else's bad decisions, um, there is a recognition of how our policies of the past decades have failed. People in those countries and us,

Speaker 3:          00:11:22       they failed. But have they failed as bad or equally bad as if we did, if we did nothing like worse, worse for sure. We, yes, yes, mmm.

Speaker 2:          00:11:36       Worse for the people in those countries. Worse for the people in those countries as well as, as, as we should be thinking about before we take any of these actions is how does this best serve the interest of our people in this country and these actions have been counter to those best interests. And so your question about, so why do we keep doing this? Um, I think there are a lot of different things that go into that and to drive that, you know, you have the military industrial complex that benefits and makes a lot of money off of our being in a, in a perpetual state of war. You have a lot of other countries like Saudi Arabia, for example, who dump a lot of money into the United States, uh, and, and, um, kind of try to use our US military as they're forced to go in and do certain things in the Middle East that's more beneficial to Saudi Arabia. Uh, we see this happening in Yemen right now. Yet another example, interventionist war jumping in there. We're a supporting Saudi Arabia and their coalition in this war that's created the worst humanitarian disaster in the world. They just bombed a school bus and killed 40 kids a couple of weeks ago, and Yemen Yemeni civilians bombed weddings in Yemen and yet, uh, our US government is not saying, hey, we're, we're gonna, stop and Yank all of our support for Saturday with their. They're continuing to do it.

Speaker 3:          00:13:04       But you're a veteran as a veteran, do you mean you, you've served our country, you've, you've put yourself in harm's way, you, you were a part of the military, but there's so many people that are making these decisions that have not done that. Yeah. Do you think that's part of the problem?

Speaker 2:          00:13:22       Yes, and that was, that was one of the main reasons that I ran for Congress in the first place. Having come back from, uh, my, my own deployments to the Middle East at the Hawaii Army National Guard, I'm experiencing and seeing firsthand the cost of war both on our troops, on our friends who didn't make that trip home with us as well as on the people, the people in these countries where we were. And I came back and saw just the cavalier attitude that a lot of politicians take to making these decisions. And, and I, I worked in a medical unit and my deployment to Iraq, we were in a base about 40 miles north of Baghdad. And um, our base where we were was, was nicknamed a mortar Rita Ville because of the constant, almost daily mortar attacks. And everyday part of my job was to go through a list of all of the American injuries and casualties that had happened the day before to try to see if there were any of our close to 3000 Hawaii soldiers who had been hurt and to then make sure that they were getting the care they needed either in country or get them evacuated as quickly as possible.

Speaker 2:          00:14:45       And just going through, going through that list name by name every day. Um, whether there were people on there who I knew personally or you know, people who I would never meet. And knowing about the family members and loved ones, moms, dads, kids at home who were stressed out every day, fearing getting that phone call that their loved one that had been hurt or worse, killed in action. And I wondered then, you know, how many of these politicians who, who make these votes and who make these decisions actually think about this or who lose sleep on this,

Speaker 3:          00:15:28       do you think a solution to that would be mandatory military service for people who are in those positions? I don't. You don't know. What do you think?

Speaker 2:          00:15:36       Because as a soldier, I don't know. I don't want somebody in my foxhole doesn't want to be there. First of all. I think it's, you know, having an all volunteer force which we have, um, is a positive thing. I think that the American people need to impress upon their leaders, um, the importance of taking these decisions very seriously. That if they want to represent and make, represent the American people and make these decisions for our troops and for our country, they need to understand who pays that price for the cost of war. And yes, it is every single one of our service members, both those who paid the ultimate price as well as those who come home with both visible and invisible wounds, um, and who will continue paying that price for a very long time to come, but also

Speaker 2:          00:16:29       every one of our communities filled with people who may not have worn the uniform, but who've had trillions of dollars taken out of their wallet to pay for these counterproductive interventionists. Wars as we in Hawaii, for example, struggle to put air conditioners in schools where kids are trying to study in over 100 degree heat as we deal with massive infrastructure problems. People in Michigan, they just shut down the water system in a bunch of schools in Detroit because they have lead poisoning the water for the kids. So the kids are not able to use the water fountains at school. So we have major infrastructure, major cha challenges and issues. And so making sure that leaders are held accountable for the decisions that they're making is ultimately what needs to happen.

Speaker 3:          00:17:13       One of the things I learned about you in one of the things I've liked about a lot of your interviews is you have an obvious genuine person, like if you're not genuine, I'd be very shocked. That's very rare, so when you're talking about these politicians and having these people being held accountable, it's a real problem, but one of the problems with politics and one of the problems with public speaking and being charismatic is a lot of these people are just really good at being full of shit and because they're really good at being full of shit. A lot of slack, jawed dumb dumbs out there, buy into it, hook, line and sinker, wave that flag and kiss those babies and they vote these dummies office and this happens time and time again. Yeah, so saying you need these people need to be aware of the consequences are that need to be held accountable.

Speaker 3:          00:17:59       I firmly believe there's more associate and we really think I really do. I think if you look at the general consensus is something like, what is it one out of 100 or something like that. What do they think it is? Maybe more. I think it might be 10 percent. I think there's a lot of people that get through life doing things and getting away with things and not doing things that are going to cause them either danger or social consequences, but they, but they managed to get through life with a song and a dance, but they're not genuine. I think this is a giant problem with people that want to be in a position of power in the first place. Yes. Like why would they, why does a guy like Donald Trump wants to be the fucking president when you have billions of dollars in the bank? Like what are you doing? Why are you doing that? There's a weird motivation that a lot of these people have and that motivation is to be the uber they know, to be the king, to be the top of the heap, to be the queen, whatever it is. Um, I don't know how you change that in those people. I don't think making them aware of the consequences of their decisions is going to work. It's just the type of people who they are in the first place.

Speaker 2:          00:19:09       I don't. Yeah. Yeah. You think you're not wrong. However, I've just seen over the last few years the level of awareness amongst people amongst voters has been increasing as there are more and more kind of non mainstream media outlets that are shining light on these kinds of issues. And

Speaker 3:          00:19:32       when you say non mainstream seating, do you think that mainstream have been holding back?

Speaker 2:          00:19:38       I think that especially, um, I think that you only get a certain narrative, right? And it depends on, it changes based on what channel you flick to or whatever

Speaker 3:          00:19:47       because if you vary in that narrative then you get less access.

Speaker 2:          00:19:52       Uh, yeah, I guess you could say that.

Speaker 3:          00:19:54       So you get less access to the people that you want to have on those shows because that's how you get your ratings in the first place. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:19:59       Yeah. I mean, and that's, that's the problem with these, with a lot of these news channels is it is driven by ratings and if you're bringing in different viewpoints and different perspectives, um, I dunno, maybe it affects their ratings. I don't know, I don't pay too much attention to that, but I do know that when you look at, uh, you know, guys like Jimmy Dore for example, yes, you know, Jimmy Dore talks about a lot of things that you'll never hear if you flick on the TV on the, on the cable news channels and has very interesting conversations and again, bringing facts and different things to life that people don't otherwise feel like they have access to.

Speaker 3:          00:20:35       Well, there's way more of that today than there ever has been.

Speaker 2:          00:20:39       That's where I see there's opportunity and because the more people are learning like, holy crap, this is what you're doing. This is the consequences of those decisions. There's a ton of votes that happened every single day in Congress that most people don't know about unless you're really following it closely yourself. Just that, that in itself of itself is a job that, that, you know, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, they're not covering a. So really a lot of kind of these alternative sites and voices are coming through that are helping to, um, helping to inform and educate people.

Speaker 3:          00:21:13       Yeah. The, the, the idea of trying to educate politicians on the consequences and what that, what that really means and this, the, the cavalier attitude that you were talking about, like what's a worst example that like when you, when you were talking about cavalier behavior by these people that make these decisions, like what kinds of things have you seen?

Speaker 2:          00:21:36       Um, I'll speak to something that happened most recently. I think there are probably a number of examples, but I'm just a couple of months ago. And the big defense authorization bill that, that is kind of one of the, the, the only must pass pieces of legislation in Congress every year there was a three page provision that was kind of put in there without really any debate in the committee or anything like that that would essentially authorize the United States to go to war with Iran. Now you would think something like that with that magnitude would be kind of a big deal. You would want to have hearings, you would want to have be a question on strategy, objectives costs, like all of these different things that didn't happen. So when this bill came to the floor of the house where all 435 members of Congress have the ability to vote yes or no, I just put in an amendment that would have deleted those three pages from this big thousands page bill.

Speaker 2:          00:22:38       Um, and, and basically those provisions said that Congress is authorizing the secretary of state and the secretary of defense to create and implement a strategy to counter Iran, not just come and, hey, bring us your strategy and let us talk about it and see whether or not we agree and improve. It was giving the power to the secretary of state and secretary of defense to create and implement a strategy to counter Iran. Extremely dangerous and a blank check to essentially start a brand new war that currently has not been declared. I introduced this amendment and if you want to take a guess on how many people voted for it, how many 60?

Speaker 2:          00:23:29       60. Why wouldn't they? Why would they want that blank check? There are some people who legitimately do want to do, want us to go to war with Iran or who are those people? Um, you don't have to name names there, there is, uh, there are, I would say it's a bipartisan feeling. And why do they want that? Because Iran, uh, they, they feel that Iran is a threat to both the United States and Israel and Iran is and has been for a long time. They feel I'm a menace, I guess essentially, and our enemy, even though Congress has not declared war, uh, even though, you know, we, our country just signed a nuclear deal to make it so that they can't build a nuclear weapon. Um, it's, it's, uh, it, it gets to a point where it seems like a hysteria, but again, it's not based on an actual thinking through tactically and strategically and responsibly what we're actually doing and what our policy is. Are you one of the younger people in Congress? Yeah. You could say that there's a handful of us who are under 40, not many small handful in. Is that,

Speaker 1:          00:24:45       I mean, you're, you're a person who would you like 30, 37. You, you're not allowed to ask ladies. Usually your congresswoman politicians are an exception. I guess everything has to be on the table with, we have to be a certain age to run for office, so, you know, well, how would you have to be to be president? I'm 35 so you can get in there. Yeah, we thought about it. Ah, you know, a lot of, you know, a lot of people have been,

Speaker 2:          00:25:11       especially with everything that's going on, I've been kind of urging me to, um, to consider it, you know, um, you know, I'm folk, I'm focused on home and focused on Hawaii. I'm want to do my very best to be able to serve them in our country. And um, yeah. This seems like it's too much work too. It's a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:25:31       It seems like too much. It's a lot at age. Is the shit out of those, those more pictures are always interesting. George Bush was one of the weirdest ones. Whoa. And Obama. Obama was a rough one too. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it just does. There's no getting away from that. And if it doesn't then they should probably, probably not doing your job. Probably a monster somewhere. Yeah. I'm mean, it's, um,

Speaker 2:          00:25:58       you're in a crazy business, but I think to that, to that point, just talking about, um, how few younger members of Congress, there are a. One of the things I did when I first got elected, I started something called the future caucus and it was a bipartisan kind of millennial focused caucus saying that we as a generation, um, recognize the need to work together to drop all the partisan hyperpartisan crap that is tearing this country apart and focus on solutions and actually solving problems. And so, you know, different people have come and gone in Congress. But I think what's, what's exciting now is that there is a lot more energy, interest and activity. I think from young people in this who may fall in different places on ideological spectrum of politics. But recognize that, you know, there's no reason why I should give my voice to someone from another generation who has no idea what our challenges are or the challenges that we will face from the decisions they made in left behind.

Speaker 3:          00:27:01       When I see someone like jeff sessions and then I see someone like you. Obviously you're different. You know, different realms of the ideological spectrum, but there's a big difference between someone who formed their view of the world while the Internet was active and that's you versus this crazy old asshole who thinks that people smoke marijuana are bad people. I mean he. There's a. it's a weird thing when you see some of these old guard, they are, they're relic of the past, but yet they're still in a position of power and control and they're. They're making these decisions based on this old world that really doesn't exist anymore. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:27:42       and there's so many different ways that that actually has a very real impact and I think the. Some of the hearings that we've seen most recently dealing with facebook and twitter and Google are a perfect example where you have people asking questions and it becomes very obvious quickly. Yes. They don't like. They don't know how to log into facebook. I've never sent a tweet in their lives. Some of these people are very proud that they either don't have a cell phone or they still have a flip phone, which is fine. If that's your personal decision, that's fine, but if you're the the regulatory body that should be exercising oversight over how technology is rapidly changing the world that we live in, right? You got to know something about it or be surround yourself with people who do

Speaker 3:          00:28:28       well, especially when it pertains to selling people's privacy or using people's data to influence elections and using. You know, the stuff that's been happening with facebook is even more strange because I don't know how you stop. Like there was a fantastic NPR podcast about these Russian troll farms about their jobs. People show up for work and their job is to spread misinformation and propaganda. You know about whatever the subject is, whatever ideological point they're trying to push through, but they're trying to influence the way people look at things in their targeting people's comments sections and news feeds and twitter feeds and they're trying to do something that injects ideas into people's minds and sways their perception and their point of view. And it's very strange when you think that a foreign country is doing this and that people from a foreign country that this is actually a job, so it must have, there must be some sort of a reason for this.

Speaker 3:          00:29:33       And then when you see those people that are questioning, uh, what's his name? Facebook. Uh, Dr Berg. Jeff Zuckerberg. Not Jeff Soccer Birth Mark Sternberg, Jeff Zuckerberg, the guy runs NBC. CBS. Right? But at NBC. No. Is it? Yeah, I think it's NBC, you know, Jeff Soccer, soccer, soccer. There you go. Anyone with the name of CSEC? What a strange name. But Zuckerberg's, you know, he was so guarded in that as well that, um, um, I, I almost wanted to go, hey, stop. This is not you man. Where's the real you? Yeah. This is weird. The way you're sipping water and you're just the way you're talking to people. So odd. Yeah. These, the formality of it all.

Speaker 2:          00:30:15       Yeah. Some of my friends on that committee who actually are under 40 years old, who were members of Congress and who prepared and, and you know, went in and were asking some tough questions. Um, were very frustrated just because they didn't feel like they were getting, they were actually getting, um, many answers, first of all, a lot of, a lot of kind of legally speaking in circles and that kind of thing. And um, I think when you're, when you're talking about an and there's so many, I don't know, I've kind of going in a few different directions here with, with these social media giants, how they're being misused, um, to further certain agendas in different ways. But when you're talking about like these Russian troll farms that you're, um, that you mentioned what is missing from all of the news coverage around this and all of the outrage about how this foreign country is trying to influence our elections, which is wrong and which the American people need to be aware of.

Speaker 2:          00:31:15       Where this information is coming from is the fact that we. And you're saying why, why does somebody do that? Well, because this country does want to, um, influence who were electing, right? Yeah. We'd rather work with this person. We know that person's not going to be nice to us. The United States has been doing this for a very long time. Sure. In countries around the world, both overtly and covertly through, through these kinds of information campaigns. Not, not even counting, like the outright regime change wars. We're going to physically take you out. And um, I think it is. I'm very hypocritical for us to be discussing this issue as a country without actually being honest about how this goes both ways. So yes, we need to stop these other foreign countries and Russia is not the only one. There are others from a trying to influence the American people in our elections. We also need to stop doing the same thing in other countries

Speaker 3:          00:32:16       without doubt. Um, but there's also the question is what is Russia trying to achieve? Like, oh, why do they want someone like Donald Trump in office versus someone like Hillary Clinton, like what is to be gained and how much you know. I mean, how much do they benefit from that? Yeah. This is what's really one of the big questions it's going on right now with all the Russian hearings and the Mueller investigation and trying to get to the bottom of all this and why they did what they did and what they did, and there's many people that are blowing this off and they don't think that it's important and you know, the, the president's claiming it's a witch hunt, but it's very odd that we're having this conversation in the first place. It's never existed before in any single presidential election. There was never been talk of us or any politician that's running for president being influenced by a foreign superpower before today.

Speaker 3:          00:33:08       It's just amazing that it took until 2016 before this became a real issue. That's true. That's true. Well, there's talk about Hillary and uranium and all kinds of other different issues and you know, I mean, I'm, I'm not a giant Hillary Clinton fan and one of the reasons why I'm not as. I just, I think she's a politician, you know, and I don't think she's a genuine person. I just don't. I think you get to a, a level of lying and the way they conduct themselves in the way they've been doing it for so long that they don't even think it's a bad thing. It's just a thing you do. But one of the weirder ones that I ever saw from her was after the Libya, after Kadafi was killed, where she was not on the record, but she was still being recorded there talking to her. You know what I'm talking about where she said we came, we saw was we came, we saw, we saw him. He died. What was the, I don't know, the. Yeah, we came, we saw and he's dead or something and she was laughing, like literally laughing.

Speaker 2:          00:34:09       But this is, this is exactly what I'm talking about, about that cavalier attitude within Washington. And for me that was, that was really the main reason why in 2016 I was a vice chair of the Democratic National Party. Um, as an officer of the party, you're supposed to stay neutral in these democratic primaries. But it got to a point where I felt I stepped down from that position, resigned as vice chair to endorse Bernie Sanders, largely because of the huge difference in their world views with Hillary Clinton's very hawkish interventionist, foreign policy. And track record. Libya is, is a very prominent in recent example, Iraq is another. And Bernie Sanders, who generally takes some more um, non interventionist worldview a that was an issue, again, like as you're talking to that people weren't really raising the differences, are saying, oh, she was secretary of state. So she's great on foreign policy, but not actually looking at what is the actual policy. Right and what kind of judgment would either of these individuals have when they're serving in that most important job of commander in chief. And that was, that was, uh, a very key difference. And that was something I talked about a lot as I campaigned with Bernie around the country. And, and that was something that I saw and heard from people in big cities, small towns, Midwest, north, south, east, west, people who appreciated. I'm just being told the truth.

Speaker 3:          00:35:43       Well, there was also the, um, the speeches that you gave where she wouldn't give up the transcripts for those gigantic paid speeches she gave in front of bankers street. Yeah. Which is crazy that that's legal. I mean, that is essentially. Look, there is no way she is so entertainment entertaining. I mean, we're not talking about a Jay z concert or Kevin Hart isn't doing stand up. They paid her a quarter million dollars to talk for an hour. Like, that's not real. Okay. They're not really paying you a quarter million dollars because you're so awesome. They really want you to talk for an hour. This is some sort of a bribe. This is some sort of a deal. You're making a business arrangement. There's no question about it. There is no way that it's that valuable. It's just not her talking for an hour. What a hot ticket. Jesus, how do I get ahold of that ticket? I mean, that is crazy. Yeah. The fact that someone could play that off is if this is a legitimate business transaction, that's nonsense. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:36:40       And, and there's a direct correlation there though, with, with Wall Street, big money in general as you're talking about that influence on politics. I was talking with a guy who's, when he comes over recovering kind of finance guy from Wall Street who's left and is now come here to la and um, and, and he talked directly about that and we were talking about how even after 2008, all the too big to fail banks, they were bailed out and people are suffering. They're losing their homes or pensions and all of this stuff. These banks are bigger today than they were back then. And over time, and even over the last few years, Congress has slowly, and this is not just republicans, there are Democrats who are on the tape too, are taken this Wall Street money and you're starting to see these bills passed, peeling away the very small amount of regulations that were put on after that crash to get us back to an even worse situation than we were back in 2011. Why? How could we allow this to happen? There's a ton of money that's coming from Wall Street and funding politicians' campaigns, lobbyists who are there helping to write the legislation or kill the bad bills and again, who's who's talking about this? No one, right?

Speaker 3:          00:37:53       Very few people. How do you stop that though? Like how do you stop the funding, their campaigns a and then the paid speeches be those two things alone. If you could just cut that out and said, no, no, no, you have to be legitimate. I mean that love or hate Bernie Sanders. You've got to respect the fact that guy never took any money from anybody. That's right. And he said, I'll give you my all my transcripts because I don't have any. I didn't get paid to do any speeches and he's clean. Yeah, I mean this is the reason why he can say that. And Hillary just ignored it. I mean, she just didn't, didn't respond. She didn't say, I'll give you the transcripts because all I said was I love America and we're going to fix everything. And you bankers are dirty. It's just they don't pay you to call them names. Exactly, but it's just strange that there that, well, it's not strange in terms of the real obvious benefit. If you're going to be a politician and you want to run for office, it's incredibly expensive to win, so you need some money so you have to make deals with people who are willing to give you some of that money and you've got to figure out a way to be able to do this and still convinced the people that have to vote for you, that you're on their side. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:39:02       and this is where that narrative is being disproven. That somehow if you run for office and if you want to serve people within that political realm that you, that you have to go and Kowtow to the corporate interests and the people with the big money in order to be able to fund a campaign in order to win. So you can do good work for the people. But also you kind of got, you told these other guys you're going to make them happy to, um, I don't take any corporate PAC money or contributions from pax or lobbyists or anything else, and there are more candidates running this year, did over 100 candidates running for Congress this year who have sworn off any of those types of contributions and who run their campaigns fueled by individual donors where there's people giving five bucks, people giving more if they can give more and that, and they're winning there. There are a number of candidates who are showing that they're out raising their opponents who are backed by pacs and lobbyists. Um, they're raising more money from people who are giving these small dollar contributions and disproving that power balance where the people really do have the power. If we stand up and get engaged and involved.

Speaker 3:          00:40:10       What do you attribute that to? What's the change? Like? What's, what's causing this tank

Speaker 2:          00:40:13       change happened? When Bernie Sanders ran for president? I think he did a lot better than, than he first expected that he would. And the fact that he was able to raise, uh, in some cases more money than Hillary Clinton in certain quarters, he was, he was very competitive and all of that came from those small dollar individual contributions, you know, he talked about it, you know, $27 is the average a contribution that he got. And that was kind of a rallying cry at a lot of his events. Um, but people, I think people through that experience really woke up to their own power in this democracy and that to have a true strong democracy, it really does take us all doing our part in whatever way that we can.

Speaker 3:          00:40:57       If Bernie called you up tomorrow and said, I want you to be my vice president, would you be down? We'd have to have a conversation. Come on, man. What would the conversation be? Well, you know, he can't. I mean, he can't run again if he doesn't win in 20. Right? Yeah. I mean basically do. I mean, unless someone invents some crazy new medical technology that reverses aging, you only have so much life in you. Yeah. But you on the other hand, you can hang in there for eight years. Yeah. Not say anything, which is a yes. Your wheels are lady. Look, I,

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       I, um, here. Here's, here's the way that I've always done

Speaker 2:          00:41:37       made my decisions from the time I ran for the State House representatives in Hawaii and I was 21 years old. A lot of people said like, what are you doing at 21? This is crazy. But I, I cared very much for my home, my community about environmental issues and things that I saw were not being addressed by many leaders in our state who I felt were out of touch. Um, and joining the national guard and later running for Congress, I try to make my decisions based on how and where I feel like I can make the most impact. So that's, that's what I will continue to do.

Speaker 1:          00:42:15       Well, you definitely can make the most impact is vice president of the United States from America. Uh, it depends who you ask. Well, if you asked me, yeah, your opinion, I would say, I would say that's a pretty big platform, although that pence guy, you don't hear a peep of that guy. He just kind of heightened. It's what you make of it, I guess. Just like any job, right. It's what you make of it. But it's like, isn't that a joke? Like if you want someone to disappear, just elected vice president. I think that's a joke, right? Oh yeah. That's a different story. Right? Right. Or um, house cards too, right? Yeah. I think that's next level. Yeah. Yeah. They're going to keep going. We're going to kill that guy off somehow or another. Somebody asked me when that show

Speaker 2:          00:43:02       for the first season came out, like some of my family especially, it may have been my mother like, honey,

Speaker 1:          00:43:08       is that really what it's supposed to be? Loosely based on the Clintons

Speaker 2:          00:43:12       there, there are some quotes and some things like that that Kevin Spacey had as the whip in the house. Like there was some things in there like, Oh wow, I've actually heard people say that, but all the, all the salacious stuff. Like I had to come from my mom's like, no, I'm not like catching the subway late at night and.

Speaker 1:          00:43:29       Right. Yeah. Well that's, that's a little bit was some of the top. Yeah, that was a little ridiculous. Meet me by the subway. Yeah. Spoiler for anybody. Um, but as a long time ago. Yeah. But for a lot of people that is their education on politics unfortunately. But it's just such a complicated process. If you're a person that has a full time job and a mortgage and kids and maybe you got a hobby and you're supposed to be paying attention to these people that are running the country or running whatever it is, running the Senate or anything political, it's just too complicated. It's tough. Like what you were talking about with these bills that get passed, that have these hidden agendas deeply written into a thousand page document. How can a person who has three kids and a mortgage and a 40 plus hour a week job plus commuting, how can they pay attention to all this? No.

Speaker 2:          00:44:25       It's very hard. And that's where you come in. Yeah. And, and you know, like I try to put stuff out on twitter and facebook and Instagram, social media because most of us are on those platforms and as you're scrolling through, like maybe you're going to see that one thing like, hey, you know, Congress just passed this bill making, you know, deregulating a fracking and liquid natural gas that's affecting your water and your air and connecting the dots between what can seem like very out of touch policy, wonky things too. Okay. How does this actually affect you, your family, your kids, your house educated, like the things that really do take up most of people's time and consciousness and care on it on a daily basis.

Speaker 3:          00:45:09       Yeah, and that's one of the more dangerous things I think about having a person like trump as president is that it's eroding people's confidence in the person that runs the big show. Is that your.

Speaker 2:          00:45:24       That's one of, that's one of a number of things that have eroded people's confidence. I think if you, if you take that one step further and look at how people's confidence in our entire election system has been eroded a, when you look at all of the vulnerabilities that exist, a lot of the stuff that's being talked about now,

Speaker 3:          00:45:43       do you mean in terms of electronic voting, the machines or.

Speaker 2:          00:45:46       Yes. I think overall people doubt whether or not their votes matter. First of all,

Speaker 3:          00:45:50       did you see the documentary hacking democracy? No, I didn't. It's fascinating. And it was in regards to what year was that? I want to say it's 2008. Was it eight? Six. Six. So it was about Bush and Kerry, right? Wasn't that Bush and Gore? Was it Bush and Gore? Whatever it was. Both of elections actually. Okay. But it showed how there is built in third party access. So it's literally built into the system. Right. That a third party can influence the count and they showed how they did it on the, um, in the actual documentary they used these machines and influence the results. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:46:40       yeah. What, what to speak of the. At the DEF defcon hacking conference that just happened or happens annually in Vegas, but they just had one this year, a couple of months ago, maybe a few weeks ago. We're an 1111 year old girl hacked into a replica of Florida's, uh, election system and change the outcome of their election in less than 15 minutes.

Speaker 3:          00:47:03       It is an 11 year old hacked into US voting system in 10 minutes this weekend. Oh, 11 years old. Well, that's American engineers one ma'am. That's what we do here. We breed them young and smart. Hire that kid. Exactly right. If there's tons more, tons more like her. Oh, there's probably millions now. I mean, kids growing up with computers from the time they're little and fit in learning, coding like they're learning the English language

Speaker 2:          00:47:33       and just like the drive and kind of the thought process and that, that kind of desire to take things to the night and not just say, okay, okay, this is an ipad. This is how it works. That's fine. It's like, well, how do we make the next, the next generation of this? How do we break this and makes the next better thing,

Speaker 3:          00:47:51       but we can bank online, right? Yeah. Why can't they vote online? Why can't they make all of this as secure as they do banking?

Speaker 2:          00:48:00       Well, you, you still see every now and then fraud. Well yeah, there's bank fraud, there's direct bank fraud, but you also see, um, banks get hacked and yeah, they've got, I mean they've got, you know, their reserves and all that other stuff and they try to deal with those vulnerabilities and try to stay ahead of them. But even the technology that banks use is not foolproof. And when we're talking again about voters having confidence that when they take that time on election day, take off from work or school or whatever and go cast that vote that it's going to be counted and counted accurately. Like this is what's at stake. If people don't have confidence in that then then we are in serious trouble. So one thing that, uh, I introduced a bill a few months ago based on last year's defcon hacking conference results that, that really showed the best way to secure our elections systems. The actual systems themselves is either used paper ballots or have a voter verified paper backup. If you're going to use an electronic system,

Speaker 3:          00:49:04       so you have an electronic system, then a voter verified paper backup, so if there's any dispute whatsoever, then you go to the paper, go to the payment, they don't correspond.

Speaker 2:          00:49:13       You can go to the paper. So in Hawaii for example, you can choose when I go vote, I can grab a paper ballot, traditional or I can go to the the machine, which I usually do go through and make my selections and before I hit the final submit ballot button, there's a little printout that pops up in a little window that shows a my voter number who I selected to vote for so I can actually check the paper myself before hitting submit. So we just did this. Virginia has off your statewide elections, so they had theirs in 2017 and after that defcon hacking conference happened at last year. They said we have to fix this before our election, and they did. How did they mess up? They implemented. They did paper ballots or they did paper ballot voter verified paper backups and their elections commissioners came and testified in Congress, have after the elections were done and they said that that was the first time in their entire careers that they didn't have a single complaint about the accuracy of the vote count itself were in previous years they had, but they're proof that you can turn like you identify the problem.

Speaker 2:          00:50:25       This is not going to take years to fix like can action that within weeks and actually secure the outcome of these elections. That's what I've been pushing for a in Congress, especially as we had to these midterms, especially as we head into 20 slash 20. But again it goes back to the point like my bill hasn't gotten a vote yet. Why is that? It's a very simple black, nonpartisan bill. Here's a problem. Here's the solution. We can action this now, but you have leaders in both parties who are just continuing to fight and and Fred and Moan and Groan about how we have all these vulnerabilities in our elections but not actually doing anything about it. To using it as a partisan kind of political football, but again, why, why don't you actually solve it? Why do you think they don't solve it? Because it's issues like this, that it helped with fundraising and they help kind of motivate people and they worry people and they bring all these fears about. It's good for ratings. It's all, all these different reasons, um, that frustrate people frankly who know about it when they're not actually seeing, you know, deliver results. You're talking about a problem now for months, congressmen talking about this for months. Whereas the results.

Speaker 3:          00:51:33       So you think that they actively are ignoring the potential solutions or that they literally want to keep this problem going?

Speaker 2:          00:51:43       That's a good question. But the, the, you know, we have been talking about this a number of outside kind of election security experts have been talking about this. Some of the hackers have been talking about the fact that the only way you can secure an election is by using paper. I cannot, I cannot come up with an excuse for why the leaders in these committees and in Congress have not actually. It's like whether it's my biller, someone else's bill, why haven't they actually solve this because it's something that could potentially impact us in the coming weeks and months.

Speaker 3:          00:52:18       Well, I remember the, the hanging Chad. Yeah. Controversy. Yeah. Yeah. And how many different votes got thrown out and then there was, there was also so many people that were denied the right to vote. Was it in Florida because a, they either have the same name or similar names with people that had some sort of a criminal record if somebody made a typo when they put their name in the system and then they were, they were made ineligible. And then there was also some concern that some of that was deliberate because so much of it was taking place in democratic districts. Yeah. It's um, it's very disconcerting the idea that someone would try to rig an election. Yeah. I mean we would like to think that that is an absolutely an American thing to think of, but people could, isn't. It is, but people can come up with very strange reasons for justification of a very awful acts. Yeah. And this seems to be one of them. They think their site is right.

Speaker 2:          00:53:17       Oh, that, that points to, um, the, the super delegate issue that Democrats have been dealing with were people who have been arguing to keep the system of super delegates were in a state like mine in Hawaii for example. We've got four super delegate votes, uh, to, for the members of Congress in two for the senator. Explain that to people who don't know what a super dog. So this is something that is created by the political parties themselves. So the Democratic Party has, has been using the superdelegate system where, um, as people are running for president, you have a certain number of delegates that go to one person or another based on that state's rules. So some states say it's winner take all other states say that it's proportional. So if you get 60 percent of the vote, that means you get 60 percent of the delegates. But then you have this special category of super delegates, which there are over 700 of them.

Speaker 2:          00:54:15       It includes all 435 members of, of, sorry, all democratic members of Congress, Democrats in the Senate and people who are appointed by the party leadership both at the state and the national level. And so, um, what we saw in, in, in my state of Hawaii for example, is over 70 percent of the voters voted for Bernie Sanders. But out of those four super delegate votes, he got one which was mine. So the superdelegates don't have to cast their votes to reflect how the, their constituents voted. So of the rest of them vote, they voted for Hillary. So that puts you in a situation where, and this is not about while Bernie would have won without superdome, this is not even what that's about. This is about really looking at people casting their votes. And then you have this special group of people who are either elected or appointed who can then say, Nah, I don't, I don't agree with the way that the people in my state or my district voted.

Speaker 2:          00:55:17       So I'm just going to vote the other way. And then shift a, potentially the outcome of that election for that state or for the country so that it shifted for Hawaiian. Yeah. Yeah. So Hillary won Hawaii's. I'm a super delegates, but the people voted differently and it was 70 percent of the people voted for. It wasn't close. It was, it was. And that was how you, how you saw that. So in some states where, you know, I think, I don't know for mod I, there, there are a few other states that I remember looking at where, um, when they were counting the votes as they were coming in, they would report one number, but if Bernie won the state, his number was zero. And then there was a certain number that was already built in to Hillary's count before the votes were even finally tallied because she had already had the declared supportive.

Speaker 2:          00:56:11       Those super delegates within that state. So the Republicans don't do this. I think they may have super delegates, but those super delegates are required to reflect the votes of their constituency. So they don't have the freedom to change their, change their vote or change their mind. But um, yeah, this is uh, this, so this is something that I've been, I've been fighting to, to try to reform within our party is to get rid of superdelegates to make it so that we have open primaries so that you don't have to be a card carrying party member to vote in Democratic primary because that was another problem we saw across the country where people were turned away because in some cases while you didn't register with the party a year ago, which is the requirement and so, um, have open primaries and then you have same day registration if you're not registered to vote, should be able to register to vote on the day of the election so that you can participate in our democracy.

Speaker 2:          00:57:09       So those things seem so clear cut but seems to, are drawing. But the, the, the superdelegate issue in particular, that's so disturbing. Yeah. But seems so dirty. Yeah. So there's been some progress made sense then though, just recently the DNC had a meeting where, uh, it was a very strong majority of people who voted to bar super delegates from a casting. They're their own free votes in the first ballot in a presidential convention, so I don't know, it's been a long time since, uh, uh, uh, it's gone to the second or third ballot, but that, that was a major step forward to make sure that as people are going and casting their votes in these primaries, that they're not risking being overruled by again, a group of special individuals who are elected officials, who are lobbyists and who are party officials and people who are coming from all different backgrounds.

Speaker 2:          00:58:04       Is there any resistance to getting rid of these super because the resistance was very strong. It was not a given that he's going to pass at all people who are very, very invested in this system. It seems like they would have to be invested in keeping the system rigged. Like making it easy to influence elections by having these few people that you can control having influence over these people. These people have massive influence over the results of the election. It's, it is, it, it's, it's so counter intuitive to what we stand for with our democracy. And I think there is, um, I mean it's a fear of losing power, I think ultimately is what it comes down to. And you have people who said, hey, look, I've given my life to the party, you know, I've put in all of this time and energy, I'm a volunteer, I'm doing this and all of that, which all of that is, is fine and it's great, but that shouldn't make it so that like, you know, as, as myself as a super delegate, I've talked about this, I shouldn't have any. My vote should count for any more than yours or anyone else's and that we should be strengthening and, and empowering and uplifting the voices of the people rather than saying, well, this small elite group has way more power than you. We'll see what they think about things.

Speaker 3:          00:59:23       It's so bizarre that that's a part of the system. It just seems like that's something that should have been eradicated a long time. I should have been now. Bernie Sanders had to be fuming. Yeah, I mean from that. And then from finding out the DNC actively conspired to have him lose the primary. All of that.

Speaker 2:          00:59:41       Sorry, one last thing on the superdelegates that some of those who support it have said is that it is their job to be able to save the country in case the people elect someone

Speaker 3:          00:59:51       who isn't good. Really hilarious. That is hilarious. Justification. Oh, you know better than the whole country. Yeah. You must be super smart. What kind of tests do you have to take? Super Delicate. Become a super delegate. What do you have to do?

Speaker 2:          01:00:06       Yeah. It's certainly not a written test, you know, it's, it's really. I mean, again, you're either, you're either an elected member of Congress or you're somebody who the party chooses.

Speaker 3:          01:00:15       Wow. The idea that the reason to keep that is because you know better. I mean, that's essentially what they're saying, you know better than all the people that voted. Yeah. So disrespectful to it's crazy people. It's really crazy. Yeah. MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:00:28       So I mean that, that's been, I think a positive thing that has come through all of this is, is more people are like, you know, I honestly wasn't paying a bunch of attention to superdelegates before all of this and a lot of people had their eyes opened up to say, okay, this is clearly wrong. Why was it there in the first place? Let's do something to fix the process.

Speaker 3:          01:00:48       Well, most people don't think until this election, the general public wasn't even aware that that was, that that was a case. Yeah. And then when people find out about it, they go, wait, wait, wait, what? What? They can just decide to not vote the same way that people voted. Yeah. And then the state can lose or I mean the person could lose the state even though 70 percent of the state voted for that person. Right. That's insane. Yeah, it is. Did you read Donna Brazile's book?

Speaker 2:          01:01:15       I didn't read the whole book. I heard I got extra excerpts from it and have it.

Speaker 3:          01:01:20       Um, I will. I was shocked that they conspired to have hillary win the primaries. I was more shocked that more people weren't outraged. Yeah. What does that tell you? It tells you that people have sort of resigned to the idea that this is a corrupt system, that they don't have time. It goes back to what we're saying earlier that you know, people are exhausted. Yeah. Most people, most people are exhausted

Speaker 2:          01:01:46       and I think that's where you see a lot of, a lot of the energy that came around for somebody like Bernie Sanders or somebody like Donald Trump who are perceived as being not of the system, but it, it shows us, it shows us where we need to go honestly. And you were talking about authentic, honest leaders who have integrity and, and um, I think people are not as blind to the people can tell. You can tell if you're being real or not or if you're selling them a false bill of goods. I think they're better at it now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Paying more attention.

Speaker 3:          01:02:30       Well, there's also this, there's enough footage of people now

Speaker 2:          01:02:34       that's. Yeah, everybody's a reporter now. I mean,

Speaker 3:          01:02:38       so it's easy to go back and you say, well, look at this interview from four years ago when they, uh, were, were completely different. Like what happened? I mean, there's also like calculated maneuvers that people do politically to align themselves with one group or another where they realized like, okay, there's just a lot of money in being a of this. That's a, that, you know, there's a lot of money and being a whatever it is, republican or Democrat or there's, there's an angle for success,

Speaker 2:          01:03:05       right? Yeah. That's, um, all of those different labels and things that people are capitalizing on within the political world I think are the things that are turning off more and more people to the politics. Because then it's like, well, if you're not branded with this label, then I'm not going to talk to you. I'm not going to have a conversation or it's this camp versus another camp. This tribe versus another tribe. Rather than like recognizing even amongst our own families and friends and communities like we, we figure out ways to talk things through and find ways to collaborate and areas where we agree we can agree to disagree on certain things, but we can do that with, you know, we in Hawaii called Aloha and with respect and actually find a way through to move forward.

Speaker 3:          01:03:51       There's a lot of things that have been discussed in terms of the future of, uh, of economics in particular with regards to artificial intelligence and automation and these radical changes that are probably coming whether we like it or not. And one of the things that's been discussed as a potential solution to some of the economic woes is a universal basic income. Have you studied this?

Speaker 2:          01:04:20       Studying it now I'm looking at some of the places that have, have or are currently kind of launching pilot projects. I know there's a European country that did a two year pilot and then they decided not to go down that route. Um, I think there's a. so, so yeah, I'm, I'm taking a hard look at this because there are, there are strong arguments I think on, on both sides that we got to look and see what, um, what would the effects actually be?

Speaker 3:          01:04:47       Yeah, I'm torn on as well. I'm very open to the idea of it because I think that we, we very well could run into a situation where millions of people are almost instantly out of jobs and there no solution for that. And then out of jobs by their choice or out of jobs by automation, artificial intelligence. Exactly their position, right? Yeah. I mean this is a real problem and I don't think, I don't think it's gonna I don't think it's kind of happened slowly, right? I think problem's gonna stumble onto us very quickly. Yeah. And we are not prepared for this. And then there's a problem psychologically. People say that, well, if you just give people money, you take away their ambition and their will. And one of the things that makes America great is it people hustle and that you give a bunch of people money but they don't earn and they're going to be lazy. Yeah, I mean this is the front counter.

Speaker 2:          01:05:44       I think there's another one that points to, if you look at how much, how much taxpayer dollars are spent on, um, like section eight housing or different affordable housing programs on food stamps, on kind of these different social welfare programs. How much are we spending on overhead to administer those programs? And so would it make more economic sense to just kind of compile all of those benefits into one package and just give people a check instead of piecing it out through all of these different things. And would we actually save money as a country by doing so?

Speaker 3:          01:06:24       And the argument to, um, incentivize productivity even amongst people that are accepting universal basic income, I believe is to let them keep it no matter what. So the idea is even if you make $10,000,000 a year, you're gonna still get x amount of dollars per month as universal basic income. And you can choose to donate that to causes of your choice, but if you're a person who's concerned that this is going to somehow or another stifle people's motivation to get jobs, because if you get a job then they won't get that money, which is the case with Welfare. Right? Right. So the idea that you know, you, you, it's very difficult to get someone when you're giving them free money to say, look, you're going to have to work harder and then you're gonna get less. They're going to go, why? Why would I work harder? So the idea is, and I believe Elon Musk is one of the ones that came up with this. Well, don't take away the money. Like everybody gets it no matter what. You could choose to do whatever you want with it. But the way to incentivize action, productivity is to make that money just universally available to everyone. Yeah. Is this the universal aspect of, um, of that? Yeah. You know, I mean, I kind of, yeah, believe

Speaker 2:          01:07:30       that. I mean, just culturally people. And we were talking about these young kids for example, you know, I mean they're not getting paid one thing or another, but just their drive and their interests and kind of their intellectual. I'm a direction, I don't know. I think people are, are, are not necessarily lazy by nature and, and I think there's something to be said for wanting to actually get things done and I think you, you open up rather than saying, well, we've just got to um, our, our purpose is just to work in a job. You, you maybe broaden that spectrum to where your purpose in life is not just to work good paying job, but actually have meaning and purpose to what you're doing with your life. That's best case

Speaker 3:          01:08:15       scenario, right? Yeah. Best case scenario with universal basic income is you give people the opportunity to pursue their dreams, right? Yeah. I mean, I think that in large part, maybe the problem is planting the seed in young people at an early age that you're, you're not supposed to just try to make money to survive that here, here's your money to survive. Just what do you want? What do you want? What, what do you, how do you think you would best fit in in this world? Like what is your contribution? What could you do?

Speaker 2:          01:08:46       And I think that's, that's um, that opens it up into kind of how we view education in this country and how, um, you know, there's all this, this drive towards while you've got to get a college degree, you've got to do this, you've got to do that. But really there's a lot more where people aren't asking those questions. Like, what do you really want to do with your life? Asking that that most important question of purpose and seeing well, getting, getting a bachelor's degree or master's degree or whatever that may not. That may not be what you want or how you feel you can best use your time of your skills and whether it's vocational training or, or doing something else or be starting up a business right away or, or anything else. I think there's, we just have to broaden the spectrum here so that we're not so tunnel visioned more. We're saying, well, you're going to have to go $60,000 in debt because you've got to get a college degree of which you will have no guarantee that you will get this high paying job that you were hoping to get so that you make lots of money and then you end up wasting your life wondering what the hell did I do with myself?

Speaker 3:          01:09:45       That's a very good point because I think the system that we have in place is not perfect, but yet we're not fixing it. Right. We're not changing it. And College Education is essentially subsidized and you have so much money that these kids are in debt with. By the time they graduate. I mean I had a friend who made it through medical school and by the time he got out, he owed more than a quarter million dollars. I was like, that is fucking crazy. And he's like, when people talk about doctors and they talk about doctors being greedy, he goes, you have to understand that. So many of them are struggling just to stay alive. They're struggling just to pay their own bills and keep the lights on. The reason why they want to see 20, 30 people a day and just keep pumping in the numbers and just constantly, you know, do whatever they have to do, whether it's operations or whatever it is.

Speaker 3:          01:10:32       Yeah. And that they're not considering the overall health and welfare of these people and looking at all these different solutions, whether it's nutrition or maybe there's a way to avoid surgery or maybe there's a way to figure it out. Always strengthen your body first before we do this or maybe we all to your diet and maybe not getting enough sleep. Let's take that into consideration. And what kind of pills do you want and how are they negatively affecting your health? They don't have have time for that. They have another person that's waiting and then another person that's waiting and they have to keep those people coming in because they need that money. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:11:00       Yeah. But the bananas it is. And that's where whether we're talking about the cost of education, um, or the cost of healthcare for that matter. When we, when we look at technology and how we can both bring down cost and improve quality in these areas, um, I think there's, there's tremendous opportunity in Hawaii. There's a pilot program on, on the big island right now called paramedicine where current Medicare reimbursement laws say that as our emt is go out and ambulance to pick up somebody and they will only get reimbursed if they pick up that person and take them to an emergency room. So nevermind if that person needs to get their prescription drugs refilled, which happens, they'll call nine, one one for that. They're living out in the boonies somewhere and they can't get to where they need to go or if that person needs to see a mental health professional or a social worker or anything else.

Speaker 2:          01:11:55       So this idea of paramedicine that we're working on trying to build and, and actually, um, changed in federal policy to help support is, um, really look out for what does this person actually need and not just shove them into this healthcare system that drives up the cost for everyone. And also use technology to do that. So I was asking him, okay, so you're not gonna be able to physically bring a social worker with you on all these calls, like that's not how you're going to economize your cost here. He said, oh no, we bring an ipad with us. So was a social worker at the clinic and then we can dial them in and they can facetime with the person whose house that we've gone to, if that's the service that they need and they can start helping connect them to resources. So that's where you're able to help kind of both bring down costs, but also making sure that we have the services accessible to those who need them.

Speaker 3:          01:12:46       Well that's a fantastic idea just to avoid the trips to the doctor for rudimentary things. Right. But one of the things that Bernie Sanders brought up when he was running for president, and I thought that was very, very intriguing, was the possibility of free education. And you know, obviously we have public schools when it comes to high school and junior high school and all that other stuff. But the idea of a public full education through university to your degree, do you think that's possible?

Speaker 2:          01:13:18       Um, I think you've got the. I think it's possible, but I think it doesn't get to the root cause of the problem, which is the cost of education. And I think that if you write that ticket, then you are at risk of then these education institutions just saying, okay, so if you are guaranteeing x number of dollars for a student to go through and get that education, then we're going to adjust our cost to make it meet that amount or if it's a blank check then they'll know that they have a blank check. So we, we, we have to, we have to get to the root cause of these challenges. Um, whether it is education or healthcare, um, we have to get to the root cause of why are these costs being driven up so dramatically and not just say, well, we were going to pay for everything without actually dealing the fact that things are not affordable as they are.

Speaker 3:          01:14:14       Well, how did education get to a point where you could go bankrupt with any other kind of debt and you're no longer required to pay that debt, so if you have credit card money, you lose your house, whatever it is, but if you owe money because of a college loan, you owe that money until you're dead. Yeah. That is strange. I mean it's one of the weirder things that we have in our culture is that we saddle these young, ambitious people with insurmountable debt,

Speaker 2:          01:14:45       right? And that there are institutions that are really making a lot of money off of this,

Speaker 3:          01:14:51       right? The interest attached to it. They become addicted to this money and this is a part of the system and they're profiting off of it and they don't want it to go away and somehow or another they've talked someone into passing these laws that make these kids duck with this bill. No matter what happens in their life. Yeah. You know, getting a car accident. No, no longer take care of yourself. Tough Shit. And pay that bill. I mean, it's really mafia life.

Speaker 2:          01:15:16       Yeah. Back into the financial industry. Yeah. It's so, it's, it's really, um, when you pull the veil back on kind of the crony capitalism that exists in this country, then you start to see and connect how it really impacts people's lives in so many different ways and how it affects the policies in our country.

Speaker 3:          01:15:37       What was Bernie solution for that when he wanted to institute some sort of a free education system for higher education? What, what did he, how did he envision

Speaker 2:          01:15:48       I, and I don't know his bill chapter and verse, but I believe it was a focused on public colleges, not private institutions and that it was by levying some sort of tax on Wall Street to pay for it.

Speaker 3:          01:16:02       Yeah. That was the big criticism that everything was going to be tax, tax, tax, tax tax. But an inefficient system is going to chew up a lot of your tax dollars. So people were, were thinking their hard earned dollars. We're going to go to some bureaucracy and a bunch of red tape and Horse Shit and too many people that are working, doing too many different things just to try to keep jobs going.

Speaker 2:          01:16:20       Yeah. That's the fear, right? Yeah. That's the big republican fear. Yeah. The, the particular. I mean, you know, I think the, the focus on, um, on Wall Street I think is, is a very specific one. However, as you're looking at possible funding and tax sources. Um, but again, I mean I just point to soundbites can, can be catch fire easily, but I'm getting to the root cause of how we solve some of these problems is really what we need to do a how are we delivering education to people? Why is it that these colleges, why is it the cost of education has gone so far up and really in an, in an uncontrolled manner? Um, we look at healthcare. Why is it that, uh, you know, prescription drug companies can raise their prices hundreds if not thousands of percent on lifesaving medication for people. Um, why is it that doctors are not required to go through any kind of nutrition training as they get their certification? They go through their, there are medical school. When you look at how closely connected diet is and what people put into their bodies, to the kinds of major sicknesses that are rampant in our communities, like diabetes for example, you're not seeing that connection where you have doctors who were trained even a little bit in nutrition and how connecting that kind of preventive medicine and using food, food as medicine is not, does not even play a partial role in a lot of the medicine. The Western medicine is delivered today.

Speaker 3:          01:17:59       It is strange, but is this, is this the business of the federal government to get involved in how doctors are educated? I mean, how do you fix that without getting your hands into everything? Because obviously we would like to believe that medical schools know more about how to raise doctors than you were I

Speaker 2:          01:18:22       [inaudible], but when the government pays a lot of money to help take care of people and make sure that they have access to education, especially those who don't have money. And so it is, it is our responsibility to try to do what we can to help improve that system, um, to make it so that it's affordable and to look at these preventive health measures. I have yet to get a good answer from anyone in a medical school or in, in, uh, in that field about why eve, I'm not even talking about you have to become a licensed nutrition professional. But just having this basic education that will help them better take care of people. Why that doesn't exist?

Speaker 3:          01:19:09       Well, it's also bizarre that mean it's such a complicated thing, especially diet and nutrition. It's so complicated that even nutritionists don't agree. I mean, you have extroverts in nutrition that I'm having a bunch of debates coming up in the future to have them in at the end of this month, a one, a vegan doctor versus a former Vegan Paleo scientist who believes that organ meat and in any eating animal meat is the key to health, health and happiness. The vegan obviously believes that that's not the case. And you know, there's people that believe in high carbohydrate, low fat, low carbohydrate diets that are out there. It's so hard. And then there's the reality that every person physiologically very.

Speaker 2:          01:19:54       Yeah. Oh absolutely. But I mean, I'm just talking about like the basics. Sugar. Yes. Alcohol, yes. Yeah. And there, there are folks, um, some friends of mine in Waimanalo in Hawaii who have a little cafe and a farm and their is to be able to feed healthy food to their community. And so one of the things that they do is they identify people on the island who, you know are dealing with like 30 plus year old guy who's dealing with major heart failures already and who's obese and dealing with weight and diabetes and all these other issues and helping people like him change her diet. So they provide free meals to them for, I think it was like three months. And they have a doctor who's supervising and monitoring what the effect on their body is. And uh, my friend Malia, she told me that one of these guys who came in, she's like, you know, you shouldn't, you should try to eat more salad in your diet.

Speaker 2:          01:20:48       You try to eat at least once a day, you should have a salad. And he's like, oh, no problem, eight Mac salad every day, like Mayonnaise, macaroni, Salad, Salad. Thought that was legitimately that. He's like, oh yeah, no problem. Like he really meant it was like, no, probably not salad everyday as a staple. Right. Wow. He thought that's, I mean, that's what I'm talking about, the basic level of just like eat foods and, you know, cutting out sugar and you know, minimizing fried foods, like those kinds of things. Um, we can't take for granted that everybody just knows this, right? Especially when you're brought up in a certain way or certain kinds of culture, whatever, that, that may not be something that you're taught and, but that, that really does taxpayers, is that you're going to have less health care costs. If you're preventing people from getting sick, then you are lowering the cost of, of highly escalating healthcare.

Speaker 2:          01:21:48       Right? And we're also looking out for each other because there's information that we're distributing that listen, you want to have your loved ones live longer and be healthier and not improving quality. Oh my gosh, you know, just the time, get with your family and with your kids and being mobile and getting, getting out and around and, and so you using the example of these people in Waimanalo, that's what they've seen with the folks that they've been able to help is it's about education and like here's how you could eat in a, in a healthy way that's good for you. And seeing how that is impacting those individuals. Personal health and their families has been really life changing for some of these guys. No. As a congresswoman, what are the bottlenecks? Are you seeing that you, you, you see in the system that you would like to change or fix?

Speaker 2:          01:22:34       A civil liberties is one that um, I have, I have and continue to be focused on and an area where there is bipartisan support. Uh, when you look at a lot of the abuses that we have seen and continue to see in agencies like the NSA and, and in the post Patriot Act world where, um, laws were passed, licensing warrantless spying on Americans, um, that, that is an area where we still need to make a lot of changes. Uh, criminal justice reform is another, and this is one where uniquely right now, I think there's a moment in time where you have organizations like the Acl, you partnering with the Koch Brothers, very conservative Koch brothers, uh, coming at, at and supporting the same pieces of legislation to end the federal marijuana prohibition to deal with sentencing reform, to deal with prison reform and to make it so that we're not constantly cycling these same people through our prison systems and that we're not throwing people into already overcrowded prisons, uh, who have no business being there.

Speaker 3:          01:23:47       Yeah, those are really important points. And, um, I'm glad you brought that up. Um, I've heard argument that the wire tapping and that the surveillance program is necessary to prevent terrorist activity. Does that make any sense to you?

Speaker 2:          01:24:04       Uh, it is, it is the most often used argument. Um, the point here is that it is illegal to spy on Americans without a warrant. So if you have somebody that, you know, has raised some level of suspicion than as a law enforcement officer agency you need, we're, we're protected by our constitution in this way, right where you have to do the tough work of building your evidence and actually getting a warrant to do this. But there have been a example after example how this has been grossly abused and how, uh, you know, whether it's our cell phone records that were being gathered and mass by the NSA or other things we're seeing that because of the Patriot Act, uh, they're there the loopholes that have been created that have allowed these agencies to exploit that.

Speaker 3:          01:25:05       There's also some weird rules where like if you get pulled over, they can't ask you for your pin number for your phone, but they can use your thumbprint to access your phone. Hmm. I didn't know about that one. See if that's accurate. Um, I'm pretty sure it is. I believe it pertains to whatever the crime is. I don't think they could do it if you get caught speeding, but I think if they believe that you're involved in something that may or may not be a felony, that they can check your phone and there's actually these devices that they'd been selling to police departments that allow them to crack into iphones, which are supposedly incredibly. I'm sure you've heard of this. Yeah, I mean why else would they have that? Unless. I mean if you. If you need a warrant to access someone's Iphone, I mean you're going to go to whatever federal jurisdiction and that's involved in that.

Speaker 3:          01:25:57       They would have some sort of device, but police departments are looking to get this technology. How's it go? I'm accurate. Yeah. Okay. So they can access your phone with your thumbprint so they can go give me your hand. Tulsi. Bam. And then they got into your phone. Oh, look at pictures of you naked. I'm not to ignore those and I'm going to look at this. Please can force you to use your fingerprint to unlock your phone. Like what? How is that strange? Who were this? No Difference? Well, the problem is, and this is good and bad cops are people. Okay. There just you and I and they're just folks that have a very difficult job and a very high level responsibility. But why would you allow them to decide whether or not they can go into someone's personal property and view their information and look at their emails or their text messages and make a determination as to whether or not this person is involved in illegal activity without a judge and a search warrant. Right? That's crazy. And without cause. Yeah. I don't know if this is post Patriot Act. Is this because of this or is this just one of the things that happen sometimes is that technology accelerates at a rate where we don't have laws that are pertinent to that technology. No problem.

Speaker 2:          01:27:07       Um, and there there's some legislation that we've worked on, um, that we are continuing to try to get past to try to help get that technology to help get the laws caught up with where we are today. Uh, and there, there's one bill that we have that deals with, with emails, for example, where, um, you know, the car it is, it's against the law to open up someone else's mail, but it's not necessarily against a lot of open up someone else's email. That seems crazy because the law, the law was written back when, you know, Ha, whatever handwritten letters or letters sent through the US Postal Service was the only way people communicate and it has not been updated to this day. That seems crazy. Yeah. What are you feelings on private prisons? Um, when you're making money off of keeping people in prison than you have a serious, you have a serious problem.

Speaker 2:          01:28:05       The fact that we have a criminal justice system that is so broken that we're allowing these corporations to make money off of keeping their prison beds filled. We are doing a disservice to those people, to our communities, our family, and, and every taxpayer who's paying money for these private prisons. I mean, it seems an obvious conflict of interest exactly that you have. No, you have no incentive whatsoever to actually, um, you know, help rehabilitate people, help, help provide people with transitional training, with the drug Rehab, with, with all of these other things that can help people who have been incarcerated for one reason or another leave and never come back. And that's one of the bills that, that one of the, one of the good news stories that actually has happened recently in Congress was we pass this bill called the first step act, um, that deal specifically with this prison reform issue to help make sure that those who don't belong in prison, like nonviolent drug offenders don't go there in the first place.

Speaker 2:          01:29:09       Um, and to make it so that those who are there and those who are the returning, um, uh, you know, there were the returning inmates are, we're actually addressing what is it that is that you need to make so you don't keep coming back. Uh, and that was something that faced some opposition on both sides of the aisle. But again, it's one of those examples where when you focus on, okay, we may come at this from different directions. Like some folks are more concerned about the social cost and the impact on families and communities and how you're criminalizing people. Others are more concerned about the fiscal impact and how much money we're spending on these people cycling through our prisons regardless. We both want the same outcome, which is less people in our prisons and bringing down the costs both economic and social. And so that was a bill that we passed a through the house at sitting before the Senate right now, but it has support from the White House and ironically there is a Republican senator in the Senate who is the number one opposition against this bill. It passed like, I don't know, there were over 300 members of the house who voted for it. Uh, so there's, there's some hope there, but there's some work to be done in that area.

Speaker 3:          01:30:22       How did we get to the situation? How did, how did this whole private prison thing happened before people even realized it took place?

Speaker 2:          01:30:29       You know, I don't know the exact history of, of who made it happen or who you know allowed for this government contract to take place. But I think the sick part about it is that you have people who recognize that they could make money off of people who were going to jail.

Speaker 3:          01:30:46       I'm sure you're aware of that Pennsylvania judge who sentenced, who was, um, he was irresponsibly and a wrongfully sentencing young people to jail for profit. Yeah. And so people would think, well, you know, you're never going to see that. That's not going to be, that's, that couldn't be real. But this is one of the real problems with profit, with the idea that you can make profit off of having people in yourself. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:31:14       Having people in your cell. And when you look at all of the other impacts of that, and, and this is, this is what I often talk about when we talk about ending the federal marijuana prohibition, is look at how it is impacting the lives of those individuals who will not have a criminal record and follow them everywhere. Look at how it's impacting their children, their family members, their opportunities for their future and how these impacts are often very, very long reaching. And I'm an impact a lot of these other social systems and programs that exist and how much more prevalent these arrests are than most people realize.

Speaker 3:          01:31:56       Yeah. And then there's the economic windfall that takes place when you legalize it. Right. That's the only thing that you're seeing where these states are voting for it because they realize there's massive amounts of tax dollars that they can make. I mean, I think Colorado is 39 percent tax on recreational marijuana and people are like, okay. Yeah. Like they just pay it because it's even then it's still not that expensive. That's true. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:32:22       To speak of. I mean, you know, the people who are actually benefiting from the. Especially, you know, these kids with epilepsy and those with other medical disorders. Um, I've met with families in states like Iowa for example, a met with families and met with their kids who, you know, they are breaking both state and federal law in Iowa where even cbd products are not legal. And so they're having to find ways to get it there and they're trying to fight this within their own state to change the laws. But um, you know, these people who consider themselves conservative Republicans are talking about this issue that they feel is a lifesaving issue for their children.

Speaker 3:          01:33:03       Well, once you see people that have cancer that can't eat and they're going through chemotherapy and you realize that there is maybe one of the only things you can give someone that given their appetite back when you see children that have severe autism and one of the only things that can stop their seizures is medical marijuana. I mean, do you realize there's so many different things that we could help people with. It's not just about getting high and there is personal freedom issues that you really shouldn't be able to tell someone that they can go get whiskey but they can't get marijuana because it's foolish. Absolutely. And it's ancient. I mean it's one of those really were. We're stuck with these legacy laws that were perpetrated by people who were doing it just for profit and mean. It's not that this is a grand mystery. The, the writing is. I mean, you could read it all. Yeah, we know exactly how it all took place and we know why prohibition was enacted and it wasn't enacted to save the public. It wasn't inactive because we were really worried about people, just people trying to profit.

Speaker 2:          01:34:01       That's exactly right. And the same thing is happening now with this opioid epidemic, how there are states that have legalized either whether it's just medical or full legalization, there has proven to be a direct correlation to a drastic reduction in opioid related deaths in those states where people have access, again either to medical or nonmedical use of marijuana and you see it. You wonder, okay, if we know this and every one of the leaders in this country are so concerned about this opioid epidemic, why hasn't this been brought forward? You learn about the prescription drug companies who make a lot of these opioids who are now making the other prescription drugs to help wean people off of the opioids. And so they're making money on both ends of the spectrum without really any care for the person. They're uh, and their welfare and their wellbeing. And people are. People are dying, their lives are being ruined,

Speaker 3:          01:35:00       buy it women. There's also things that are federally legal, like federally illegal, like Ibogaine, which has an incredible result ratio in terms of getting people to kick addictions, whether it's alcohol, heroin, pills. There's clinics in Mexico that people go to on a regular basis to take this one psychedelic medicine that's been shown to have radical results. It's not killing people yet. It's extremely illegal. It's a schedule one drug in America and it's. It's one of the best examples. I mean, they're also using psilocybin. I mean there was a John Hopkins study. There's several studies that they're doing right now that they're trying to show that there's a direct correlation between use of Siliciden in these clinicals situations where they're curing cigarettes, heroin, all these different addictions with different psychedelic drugs that are scheduled. One interest is a lot of work being done right now. Maps is involved with one thing that they're doing that's helping a tremendous amount of soldiers and people with ptsd is with Mtma is assisted Mtma therapy and there's a lot of these that are being explored now where people had demonized these particular drugs or plants and they were thought to be something that would ruin your life.

Speaker 3:          01:36:25       Another really realizing no, these like many things can be used or abused and that there's solutions for a lot of our problems, but there's a lot of resistance to this. There's a lot of resistance in particular from. I mean the resistance about cbd is one of the dumbest ones of all time because cbd is addictive, nontoxic, not her end. Massively beneficial to so many people, whether it's helping them with anxiety, alleviation of pain and stress. I mean, I even got Ted nugent on it. Yeah. Ted. Ted's never done anything with anything that had anything to do with hamper marijuana and he's got bad knees, so I got to rub and cbd lotion on his knees and he was like, this stuff's a miracle. I'm like, yeah, here we go. I mean, if you could talk Ted nugent into using cbd, there's, there's, there's hope for the world,

Speaker 2:          01:37:15       but you just mentioned, I mean, whether it's cbd and hemp is another example. That's something that we're trying to do in Hawaii. I think a Kentucky, I think there's another state that's a leader in this. Slowly

Speaker 3:          01:37:24       but surely the doors opening up with that, when they realize it's not psychoactive, it's incredibly beneficial. Whether it's for food, whether it's for textiles, whether that's for oil. I mean there's so many benefits. I mean you can. There's a thing called hempcrete where they're making concrete concrete at a hand. I've heard about some lighter, incredibly durable, flame resistant. There's so many benefits to it and it's so economically viable. It's so cheap. It's a weed. It grows up. I don't know if you ever really felt a hemp stalk. It's one of the most bizarre things because it is as hard as this oak and it's as light as styrofoam. It's so weird. It's such a. it's an alien. Plants are very strange plant. Wow. But you know, demonized for so long and one of the things that's kept it from being economically viable and it's just people that don't want it to become a part of the competition, they just don't want to compete with it with whatever they're profiting from, whether it's the people that are selling pain pills are the people that are using it for. I mean, it was initially made illegal because of paper. William Randolph hearst got involved in it because he had paper mills and you know, he also owned newspaper. So we started demonizing it to get people to think that if we made hemp legal, we were going to have people running around on the marijuana Kellen people and jumping out of windows. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:38:43       that's crazy. We have A. I'm working with a Republican from Florida named Carlos Curbelo. We just introduced a bill to essentially commissioned a study by the National Academy of Science made up of objective, um, reports and other studies that have been done from states that have already legalized to one extent or another, uh, marijuana to compile a fact, an independent fact based report for the federal government on, um, what, what has come about in those states in every respect, uh, whether you're talking about healthcare economy or criminal justice and law enforcement, every single thing, look at this in a very diverse way. And, and to have this entity do it that, that sits just that sits outside of the federal government because the challenge that we keep coming up against both at the federal level as well as at the state level in some cases, is they say, well, there are no studies that show the benefits of what goodwill come about.

Speaker 2:          01:39:43       If you end the federal marijuana prohibition as one example in Hawaii just recently, the state legislature house and Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill to allow opiod addiction to be added to, um, the acceptable things that medical marijuana can treat. So even though medical marijuana is legal in Hawaii, there is a limited list of, you know, the ailments or whatever that you can prove your eligibility. OPIOID addiction is not. One of them. Legislature said it should be, which I agree it should be, but it was vetoed by the governor who said, well, those studies aren't proving that this will help those who are opioid addicts and there is a bureaucratic process that takes a really long time. If people really want this to happen,

Speaker 3:          01:40:31       what are the other things that are of concern to you as a congresswoman that you're seeing not addressed or that are somehow or another still in place when you feel like they should have?

Speaker 2:          01:40:42       Do you know there's, there's, there's, there's a long laundry list of issues and I think you can go through each of the major issues that a lot of folks are concerned about and pick those apart and say, hey, here are the things that we need to address and improve in each of those. But I think the, the conversation that I hope more people start having is about how w why aren't these things being fixed or addressed and that's, that speaks directly to people's unwillingness to actually talk to each other to stop demonizing each other because you're from the other camp and actually engage based on our common mission of serving the people, serving the people of this country. And you know, that's something I look back to during my time in uniform serving in the army national guard. You got diverse people, diverse opinions, diverse ideas.

Speaker 2:          01:41:35       But ultimately, you know, we were the same flag on our uniform and we are focused singularly on, on that same purpose and mission. And unfortunately that's what we're missing a lot of in Congress is the hyper partisanship and the political winds to often take precedence over the reason why people in our districts hire us to go and work there. And a lot of that comes from not having a basic level of respect or Aloha for each other as people. And instead just saying, hey, it's us against them. Pick your label. And that's where the battles are fought. And, and who suffers as a result of this, the people who are suffering, who are dealing with a lot of the challenges that we've been talking about. So that's something that you know, I try to bring, I try to bring Hawaii's Aloha to Washington to try to bring that through in the work that I'm trying to do on these different issues, in the conversations that we're having. Sometimes it means you talk with people who who you disagree with or you may have different ideas than they have about how you solve these problems. But if even if you're able to come together on one thing, then we can start to see problems actually being solved in and delivering results.

Speaker 3:          01:42:48       Well, what I saw from you and video is exactly what I've seen from you in person. You're very genuine person. You're very intelligent and you give me hope. You gave me hope that there are politicians that are legitimately in it for the right reason and that they have a real vision of how to fix things. So thank you. Thank you and thanks for being here. Really appreciate it. Thanks so much. Tell people how to find you online.

Speaker 2:          01:43:11       I am on social media at Tulsi, Gabard, instagram, twitter, all of those things. And uh, you can go to my website which is vote, [inaudible] dot com.

Speaker 3:          01:43:22       Go their vote. Tulsi. Thank you. Should be president.

Speaker 2:          01:43:26       Aloha. Let's close it. Yeah, there you go.
