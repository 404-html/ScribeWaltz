Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience, man, when I, when I used to make it taste good, but now I don't even make the gel shake taste good anymore. Now I'm going to slam. It just tastes terrible because I'd give a giant chunks of ginger and garlic now like I'll have like a, like seriously? Remember what pagers used to look like? A chunk of ginger. Just fucking camera shake. Put in one shake. You slammed that Ninja turtles have about half of that in a week. Shake. Oh really? No. I slam it. Slam it in four or five cloves of garlic. Smells so bad afterwards. Smelling like garlic can take for sure. Well, good jokes man. I smell like garlic. Just train you. No, just uh, just ate some garlic loads. Yeah. Become horrible.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Let me know. Next time you're in the tests and mood to make a video to youtube hits off of that. All you'd have to do. It's just I would come on the desk and just dip your finger and go like that. That's all you would have to do. It's over the you youtube would break. I'm sure you've got the curdled kind where you could just pick up. No, my login. Very normal, fertile time. This shit took a lot of water, dude. Oh, that's true. Healthy. My loads of quite fluid taste like garlic and this is back at the academy. Male crew right here. Imagine if dudes or chicks, whereas women have a certain amount of eggs and then that's it. It's over. Imagine if dudes were like that. We have a certain amount of loads. You're like checking. You pulled your balls up the sun to see like where your load line is. A lot of people that have to do. A lot of people would have blue balls, that's for sure.

Speaker 1:          02:02          The next day. Oh Wow. Girls would be like, come on, give me some low. You're not worth it. You're not worth. It. Should become until like a gambling rational thing. Guys would go in and they'd go, tantric where you squeeze it down to orgasm. If that was the tip of your Dick and like a lighter, and if that was a case that was the case, guys would have more power and getting laid. That's true. On the girls side of it, you know, like it's easy for easier for a girl, it'd be a whole lot easier for a guy if you had so many innocent. If we all fucking band together, we can make this. It's to start this right now with the podcast. Podcast is powerful to have a Dick Union. Take back your loads. Save him. It's important. Not valued right now in the equation, but dammit, they should be stopped wasting them. It's a key ingredient and making people. Oh Man.

Speaker 2:          03:00          Without the loads. You got nothing. That's the problem though is that would be like starting a fighters' union. Like that's not really going to happen, you know, but just dude's like fuck them. That's what dudes would say when it comes to the Deq Union. If we all got together and said, listen, we're gonna, we're gonna. We need to make our dicks more valuable. Okay. We need to make it harder to get to. Let's work something out here. Boys. The first ones are going to sacrifice big time and the ones that are starting this thing because now they're the only ones not getting laid. You just start this whole trend, you know, same as with the fighter union. You only one not getting paid. I think you're right though. It is really tough. It's hard. It's easy to say, oh, the voters are lazy or whatever they should do, but honestly, like you said, they got real lives to live and I haven't got time for all this stuff and that is a really big part of why we want to make it simple.

Speaker 2:          03:46          You know, we're assuming that people want to spend less time doing this stuff, not more time and I think a lot of the kind of, um, organizations and people that have tried to get people mobilized, you know, civic organization and the kind of thing, you know, it's, it's worked to a certain extent with some people, but for the majority of people they just don't want to do it. They can't do it actually. There literally too busy with things that are higher priorities, like their kids and their family and their job or whatever it may be. Hobbies doesn't matter. It's stuff that they choose to do and that's fine. That's their life and we shouldn't kind of require that you have to spend ages figuring out this political stuff and that's why we're trying to make it really simple for people, but based on quite a lot of compost and that's what technology allows you to do.

Speaker 2:          04:33          You can take quite a lot of complex data and information like we're doing with the campaign finance records where it's literally hundreds of millions of pieces of information and we're boiling it down into one piece of information which is a score like where is this candidate on the. On the scale of liberal to conservative, where do they sit and where are they on each issue? That's what we're trying to do to make it really simple. Isn't it sort of analogous in a way to what we were talking about about the amount of people that you can keep in your brain. Dunbar's number is that if you lived in a small tribe, if safe, we all live 50 of us together in some small village somewhere. We really wouldn't have votes about gay marriage and we really wouldn't have coats about could be a million different things that would never be up for vote and if someone really did start micro managing everyone's lives, you'd be.

Speaker 2:          05:25          You'd be like, Hey, you know, Mike is an asshole. We got to kick him out of his fucking tribe. This guy's trying to get people to wear purple and you know, where certain Nike's during different moon cycles and make tribal rules and rituals and make all these things standard and you know, for whatever reason he doesn't like men sleeping with men. Like he's got some weird thing. You know, he believes it's so true. I just so agree with that. One of my favorite things that I'm one of these experiments that was in Holland, I think I've got that right in in, in Europe and they did this brilliant experiment with traffic where they are in a town, I think it was friesland or something like that, probably got that wrong where they literally took away all the traffic signals, all of them, everything, right? They took away traffic lights.

Speaker 2:          06:13          They even took you stop signs, everything, even the, the markings on the road. So they took away the white line in the middle of the road, everything all gone and their theory was that without that kind of external rule making and kind of stuff going on to tell you what to do, people would have to kind of relate to each other as other people and just figure it out amongst themselves. So they would, um, you know, have to look other people in the eye and sort of work it out between them. And they found they had this brilliant effect, which was the, um, accidents felt a zero. The traffic improve, the traffic speed was lower, but the traffic flow was much better. It just worked all around. All the kinds of things that you try and do when all these people thinking about traffic planning and whatever. They achieved those aims by literally taking everything away and just allowing people to relate to each other as humans. And was. I thought it was such a great little story and I think that you could do that in all sorts of areas. If you just leave it to people to figure out on a small scale where they can relate to each other, you just get a much better result.
