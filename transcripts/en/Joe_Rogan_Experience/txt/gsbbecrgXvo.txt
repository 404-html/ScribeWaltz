Kick it, Brian. Where's the music? Oh, what'd you do? What is this? This is like a remote version of the song. What's, it doesn't go through the speaker. I forgot that we got to get a new computer folks. We've got to get a new computer. Are A, we have only a few years old, but try running a computer from four years ago with today's operating systems and all this stuff. It's, it's, you noticed the difference. You notice a big difference in how fast it works,

Speaker 2:          00:02:06       especially when you're not just like using iphoto.

Speaker 1:          00:02:09       Yeah. Yeah. I feel like for regular stuff it's almost like they make things more complicated so you actually need, you know, a bigger hard drive and a bigger, you know, a a faster processor. But you know for like just web browsing how much that's what most people do. It's the most intensive thing.

Speaker 2:          00:02:26       Yeah. I don't think many people are editing podcasts and videos and this and this one. This is the old, what's the power? Mac is what is, what's it called? That shit is like the noisiest thing in the whole entire world. It's like that's supposed to be that top of the line thing, but there's 17 fans on there and the thing just sounds like it's going to take on men for being in the room with sensitive mics and podcasts. It's meant for, you know, some serious work. Yeah. Our friend we have here today, ladies and gentlemen, is a serious author, a man, his name is Daniel Bolelli as I say it, right? Yup. And he wrote a book about arts called a

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       on the warrior's path and also wrote a book about religion called 50, what is it, the 50 things they don't want to or not supposed to know. Religion. Yeah. And you wrote it for disinformation. So this Info Dotcom guys, which I really, I'm a fan of their stuff. I love the, uh, the Europe being lied to books. They're great, really, really awesome stuff. And really like great toilet reading, you know, a feast. The person who tells me that say, yeah, you know, because you are being lied to. It's like really short paragraphs and you know, you might, if you're healthy you probably won't get through a whole paragraph and a shit. If you get through a whole paragraph and his shit, you might want to put some Broccoli in your diet, you know, but they're, they're, they're good like short pieces. Brian, what the fuck? What the fuck, Brian?

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       I'd have no fucking fucking, um, but they're, they're good short pieces that, um, they're, you know, they're, they're really eye opening and enlightening. So the, in disenfranchised, they put out a lot of cool stuff. And so they've gotten behind you. I think they've put out some of Graham Hancock stuff too, didn't they? Yeah, that's what was kind of like the Formula Ford. His books don't like. Their whole idea was, I submit it to them, this giant book I've been working on 400 pages long with footnotes, all this stuff about religion. And they were like, yeah, that's sweet on the old, but seriously, can you give us something quick? And that funny, weird that has an impact right away that people, as you put it down the toilet and get on something in dance back quick, very difficult for people to discipline themselves to read any serious piece of work on anything.

Speaker 1:          00:04:30       It's just when you're just simply stating the facts and documenting things, it's, you know, it's oftentime a dry read. Even though it's fascinating information. They're really clever in their idea of just, you know, figuring out a way to get it. And then, you know, probably once people read this book, get familiar with your writing, get into, then maybe they'll dive into like some of your more serious stuff. Right? Yeah. Even see it as a big large cause I had even in the big book I add the one of the chapters about the existence of God beginning sweet though woman having a screaming orgasm. So I mean he's only, it can only be socio Yosi right. But I guess it was a, the idea was not, let's do something else that they have a CD has going to 56 they are not supposed to know it works well for them.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       They want to do something or religion and initially because I was attached to the other project, I was like ask her to wait. I don't want to have to wait. I want to, when they told me the magic word advance, suddenly I wasn't. Yeah, a little money always greases the wheels. Like what do you want me to be weird and funny and quick about religion? No problem. No problem. Now you, where are you from? Italy. Yeah. What part of Italy are from mainland, which by the way, I want to apologize to your list in cause I've been living here, believe it or not, I've been living here 20 years and when I first moved there, I swear I was speaking almost decent English, but then somebody brought to my attention that many American women like my weird Italian access, he kept it simple. A good one to have. Matt, I'll tell you what. If I talked like you, I'd keep that shit too. I can understand you. I mean

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       it's not like you're not, it's not difficult to understand is you're very clear. You just have a very distinct Italian flavor. It's like reading cursive writing. Exactly like cursive, like typing. If you, if you had a typing program that type in cursive being understood versus me like my women. No, I think I take me like, yeah, that sounds like a lot of fun. Yeah. Yeah. Women, well men do too, man. You hear girl than English accent. You're like, Ooh, listen to that. You know. No Australian English, anything. Yeah. You know, it's why? Why is that? What is this? Everyone's dissatisfied with what they are. Everyone is looking for something different. Everyone wishes they were someone else. Everyone sees the grass greener heavily goes, God damn, I wish I had an accident. Like that guy. Hey works for me. So I'm just, it's one of the biggest sins, right?

Speaker 2:          00:06:45       When you fake an accent, can there be more douchey thing to do? Like remember when Madonna was talking English? Do you remember that Brian? Yeah. She only did it for like a little bit until people start calling her on it. Brittany, Brittany Spears also data for a while it seems like, but Britain, nobody takes Britney spears. Seriously. You know, Britney spears is a crazy person. Madonna. It's like a legit artist. He's got a little carried away. Yeah. There's a lot of people that do that. Why actually trained some sentences. Just kid. I have caffeine for awhile and fake accident for this is my sixth or seventh day of no caffeine. Yeah, that's fascinating man. Yeah. Um, yeah. I'm a junkie. I didn't even know it was a junkie feel great now, but, uh, I'm not convinced that I'm going to stay off the coffee, you know, it's just like, I now I know what it's like to be like person hooked on cigarettes, a cigarette.

Speaker 2:          00:07:33       I'm like, no, he just coffee right now. You're like, oh, that looks delicious. No, because the physical poles on the same, um, the physical pole and I can substitute it. Like I'll drink like a chai tea latte, which has like the tiniest amount of caffeine. Nothing like a coffee, but it's like a warm liquid per day. Don't main lineup. I just take them right into my fucking veins. Um, but uh, do you drink coffee brother? You had a really good point. You were saying before the podcast about this, we were speaking about to use it the same way as somebody who was used as hard drugs, you know, dry. I'll try just when I absolutely need it. Then I'm wired for 10 hours. I don't, I'm not even going to getting coffee. I'm just going to have a double espresso when I need it. Just go with you. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:08:12       speak 50 miles an hour for an hour and then pass out and not actually for three months. That's the Harry. Such a smart move. That's such a smart move. The reason why I did this and the first was because I took, I took a few days off just randomly, just like I, you know, decided that just didn't want any coffee. And then I had a cup of coffee and Oh my God, my heart was pounding and I was like, wow, this is crazy. We just took a couple days, maybe three days, and I was, you know, my, my tolerance had broken down. Right? I don't know why or how that happens that quick or if I just got a really good batch at Starbucks. And then I started thinking about it like, wow, how much resources is my body using to fight off the stimulant every day? And how normal is this?

Speaker 2:          00:08:51       You know, how healthy is this? It can't be. And I get the same feeling like when, when I'm drinking coffee that I do when I smoked too much cigarettes where it feels like my body is like craving it. But I get a headache kind of from it. Like I could probably do it. Right. Yeah. Poison. Yeah. And you're, you're, you're addicted, you know? Yeah. Most certainly am addicted to coffee. I see it and I smell it, but I can get around it with t and t doesn't wire me. Doesn't work for me. It doesn't ice tea. I drink shit loads of ice tea. But that is like as bad as drinking coffee, I think. Really? Yeah, there's coffee, but you know, you could drink herbal tea too. I like herbal tea. You know, you could have like, you know, there's, there's a lot of different types of herbal tea that have no caffeine in them.

Speaker 2:          00:09:32       For me it's like tape Pletcher our buddy said it best. She said it's like, drink a cup of coffee. It's like having a warm hug. You know? It's like, I'm not really looking to be wired from the coffee. I just want some warm liquid that tastes good. I like the taste of coffee. Yeah. I think you need more love, man. I need more love. I think you've got a good point, brother. I liked the way this guy thinks. So you a, you wrote this book on religion and you wrote also a book on martial arts. So what you and I, I have a

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       lot in common man. We have a lot of uh, very, uh, similar interests. Um, w how did you get involved in religion? Were you raised religious? No. Um, no. I just, I'm fascinated by it because you see how much he means to people. I would match their whole world view their life, their priorities, who they marry, who they want to out with. Everything depends on the kind of stuff they put in their head based on religions. So it's powerful stuff. It's amazing that it's still works. This is a 2011. It's, it's, you know, with, it's very difficult to have pure objective thinking. But then again, you know, the thing is the staff that dry. So these is that people are scared of dying and rightfully so because you know, we don't go and throw object shape. We don't know anything about anything really about that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:37       I'm like, you only verse works just died. So we should say rest in peace to Patrice O'Neil, who's a great guy and a great comedian and an awesome dude, awesome thinker. Cause a warm friendly guy. Oh, we'd love, always love seeing that guy and I'm going to miss him. I miss him a lot. It was a, it was a great comedian who's a great guy, you know, just sucks. It just, he had poor health, you know, he had diabetes and uh, yeah, I guess he just didn't really take care of himself. He ate too much and he wound up having a stroke and um, then he was in a coma for a little while I guess. And then, you know, he was a, it was really difficult to get the information out because the family was sort of protecting it and rightly so. We don't know exactly the details of it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:25       So, uh, this is all really what I'm repeating. It's just stuff that I heard on the Internet. I have and I'm so sad about it. I didn't want to call anybody and talk to anybody about it. You know, I talked to Stan hope about it today. We talked to for this deck. It's a minute. We can, we can you say it sucks. We both just said that we didn't, we really didn't even say anything other than a socks. So I asked him, I go, did you hear about Patrice? He goes, yeah, socks. I go, yeah. Socks. Can't even say anything else. I'm, what am I? Anything else has, is going to happen to all of us one day. It's like the real moment of actually dealing with loss is really intense. You know, it's, it's real hard to deal with Patrice. We're going to mess you, miss you a lot, man.

Speaker 1:          00:12:06       He was, he's one of those comics date that was so quick. Like just seeing them on opion Anthony all the time. That was the one thing that I could just, he who was really fast and hilarious, like how powerful, he's a comic man. He's a real comic. Did my favorite Patrice thing wasn't even have him doing standup. My favorite purchase thing was him on a, um, one of those like Fox rate. It was either Fox News or one of those talk shows where someone had said something inappropriate and gotten in trouble. I believe it was like opie and Anthony, they, I think it was the incident where they had some crackhead on their show and the crack head, which talked about he wanted a rape Condoleezza Rice and like it was, it was just, they had a crazy person on their show and like, and they got suspended for it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:52       I think that was what he was defending. But there was a woman on who was with him and this woman was like talking about how you shouldn't have said this, you shouldn't have done that. And Patrice has just clown her. He's just like, you don't understand funny. You guys understand funny. It all comes from the same place. And the way he said it, it was so honest and so well thought out and it made them look so silly. It made people criticizing people who stepped across the line with comedy criticizing them, you know, as if what they're comedy was. It was like an actual statement of their real beliefs. Now it's comedy, you know, and it all comes from the same place that the ability or the attempt rather to try to make people laugh. And he broke it down so well. And it was so funny the way he did it, the way he handled it was so brilliant. He was just a real quick guy, a real unique thinker and a guy who, you know, I always really love to see. And whenever I ran into him I was always happy. You know, comedians are a rare animal. There's not that many of us. It's just the video right here that, that, that you're talking about. Um, I don't think so. No, it was, yeah, that's it. Yeah, absolutely. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:13:55       clown, this lady, oh, sorry. She took part in the recent protests calling for radio stations to shop, stop supporting negative language in music and talk radio and also our favorite standup comic. Patrice O'neil. Patrice are ONA next. Oh, nice. I hope Davey. I was Jamie and I was then Lucy job. Well, Imus. It's funny, this is thing I have. I don't know her, but I'm uh, I'm assuming that she has nothing to do with funny. So I'm gonna speak as the expert on funny, funny. People should just be left to try to be funny, but it would, if they're not funny, then you made a mistake. But how many, listen, how many times has the unfunny, how many unfunny rape jokes lead to rape? Like, I don't know how many jokes about rape there are. There's a lot, but you're not funny. You're world is to Mexico.

Speaker 3:          00:14:45       Next one. The big story. My world is people trying to be funny. You think it's okay to try to make jokes about rape? I'm diabetic. I make fun of that. I'm a victim. I might lose a toe to make funny. I'm trying to make fun of anything. I, I think I can make fun of Sonia. You know what's happening now. It's the marketplace. Okay. Is deciding what's appropriate and what's not appropriate. I think the nation is just tired. There's a new mood in the nation, the nation. You know what? We're tired of things that are just, the nation is painful. And you mom, I'm not the nation. I'm just speaking for me and sunny. You're speaking for the nation or you speak it for, yeah. You know why? Because I remember six years ago doing something against Anthony opening because they were just so outrageous and they're violent images to the neighborhood out to women was just uncalled for.

Speaker 3:          00:15:42       And now, now I think people don't try to be funny. I think now people in this country trying to be higher. You know what? I don't care if they were trying to be funny. That's what I'm saying. And tell you in that business, I've been into your show once and it wasn't very funny being a woman like me. I was in the paper with her and the joke is hilarious. Called the angry pirate. And The lady who wrote it in the, in her outrage didn't even know what it meant. And anybody who read it laugh cause they know what funny. You're not living in the context of funny. You'll get all these guns have every right to be as funny as they want. They can go out and try to be as funny as they want. Make as much money, make as much money being as funny as they want. This is what's happening. There is a change in this country. People are realizing they have an opportunity to speak out and advertise their listening.

Speaker 3:          00:16:34       You're not going to get paid as much money anymore. That's what it is. The marketplace, they'd been on a tear lately. Are they cleaning house or is this the PC cops run a month. You know what it is, John. You know what it is? Why you reading that paper is the PC cops run a mug? Of course she is. She's, she has an entire encyclopedia of her stance on it, but it's no passion involved. It's not a real, this is just what she has to say. We are outraged and fired. He's an insightful main calling. I'm outraged. I am.

Speaker 3:          00:17:15       You know what? These people in this country, here's what, here's my question. How can you justify a bad joke? A joke that isn't funny. Oh wait, wait, wait. Go ahead and attempt it. That isn't funny. Doesn't get any laughs and is about raping a, the first black woman to ever becomes a secretary of state in the United States. Throw that at me trying to fight for the joke. May or may funny jokes and unfunny jokes, uh, uh, come of the same birth date. You, you don't know if anything is going to be funny. You should attend to be able to make anything funny. Think a joke about rape is doomed to be not fun as possible, but I've heard him, you heard the funny rape joke. I say a couple of watch my feel special. Pretty good that if you're having sex with a woman, oh, doggie style. And if you just the right, it's a Jackie late and I and kick her in the Shin as she walks around like urgh. It's the angry pyre. That's what she was trying to say. Hitting her in the back of her head. Her body don't be punched, which will then why are you laughing?

Speaker 3:          00:18:34       It's called humor that she has no one. And the same problem that opie and Anthony that you can't say anything on the hair to say anything you want. It might not be funny. You might get in trouble for it, but you should be able to be attempted. And plus when is a crazy, but I'm going to get an opportunity to rate the president, the president's wife, John, trying to be funny. All right, Patrice, why aren't I hearing now Sharpton complain about this thing involving, cause it wasn't involving a young uh, black women. Whoa. This evolving in a very prominent black woman. Well where was she throwing during young black? Everybody has their agenda because there I was there. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, right. Excuse me. Know Why am I not here? Cause it doesn't concern him. It's not concerned him as black is, you know it.

Speaker 3:          00:19:19       Come on now you know what Al had, Al Sharpton has his agenda and it was perfect for al young black women and now she's representing just women in general. She's not representing the nappy hope. Ah, she's representing just the whole and that she has nothing to do. Just the whole tone. You know what? Women have been abused publicly in the media for too long and people are tired of it. This has been a beautiful response of just the general public saying to advertisers, where your consumers, she's awesome. Want to have to avoid everything in the street. We don't want to have to worry about what radio station we turn on and there is some really derogatory violent, you're going to get to deal with information. Um, Ma'am is second hand from someone making you aware that someone may have said something that you should be upset about? It's a shame y'all could stitch a sweet deal. The people you represent on all victims. Theresa, Neil, thank you very much. Thanks for both of you. We appreciate

Speaker 1:          00:20:22       the time for big love like dumb people who talk ridiculous and try to sound intelligent. I think she's like, it was speaking for the entire country. We and we are fed up and we're like, whoa, whoa, whoa. How preposterous. How beautiful. Was he in that though? Yeah, it was. It was beautiful. I love that dude. He is who? Messy Buddy. That's it. That's it. Rest in peace. See Ya on the other side. Peace out. Alright Daniel, back to you brother. Yup. Um, so Danielle, how'd he say it? Danielle. Danielle. Danielle. Slick bastard. I love the fact that you admitted he kept it. He kept that accent. That's fantastic. So, um, I don't know how we got into this, about people being afraid to die. That's what it was. And then uh, yeah cause I mean wait through legion. If you read even like early 99 that it's people are sinking.

Speaker 1:          00:21:14       Okay. Now we modernity, you are in a mother and ward and more secular word. Oh the kind of more traditional superstitions are all going to phase out and immediately makes sense on the surface. But not really because until you have the answers to the things that make people really freak out. Dying. Grief, what the hell? You know, cause I mean, our life is so short and we don't know Jack Shit about before her afternoon until you give some people some answers. People are not comfortable having no answers, no matter how bullshit does answers are they, they need them. It's almost like religion is some sort of an evolutionary device like a bridge to to take us from being monkeys to being enlightened beings. Like we need some horse shit to get us through this. We need a believe. Otherwise. You know, the idea of no one ever wants to think of, you know, the, the concept of life being that it may be that you have lived this exact life before and you will live it over and over again until you get it right.

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       And the idea that this could go on into infinity, you know, and that might be what life really is. And we, we don't think of it as being possible because it's too hard for our minds to wrap around and too alien to what we absolutely know to exist. Like, you know, birth and death and you know, having a certain amount of time here to get things done and seeing people die, you know? But the actual possibility is almost like, it's too fucked up for us. So somebody had to invent religion in order to just patch up the road till we make it there. Yeah. Cause I mean in reality we don't really control, you match anything your life and we're conscious and where cultures are. So that's a quagmire. The universe, the universe itself. You know, I had a bit and one of my past alums about if you ever are starting to take your life seriously, just stand out and go outside and just look up at space and just really wrap your head.

Speaker 1:          00:23:08       I mean everybody looks at, Oh there's a stars, stars are bright tonight. But very few people actually look up and go, wow, you know that that literally is infinity. Like we're floating and infinity. And it's the majority of what I see, you know, all around the top. It's easier to see infinity than it is to see the ground. I mean I have more view of the infinity like and it's amazing how rarely that comes up that no one, no one talks about it. And it almost, it's too much. So we just sort of accept that we live in space and except that we look at the clouds. What is the first religion? What's the first known religion? I mean if you look at the,

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       I have a chapter in there that I had half of the fun of doing this book was coming up with a title schools in like in a few words you just throw out something outrageous and where that gets things going and let me see if I remember what this one exact was because I had a blast with the origins of religion. Let me

Speaker 1:          00:24:02       when will this book we released should be these week? This week I think is [inaudible] dot com you can pick it up

Speaker 4:          00:24:07       and then Amazon, Amazon, the whole, Oh yeah, this one. I have a chapter entitled mammoth porn and the Caveman see pulp. The origins of religion, because the very first evidence that archaeology suggest these may be the beginning of religious behavior. They see these cave paintings laugh by cave man were the main things that these guys who are drawing where hunting scenes and animals having sex, the idea of being these guys who are like doing these rituals because their life was on the line to ensure success in the hand and then you know, animals are data so you need to make sure there are more for the next time around. So you're trying to send out the vibes of the animals have sex, there's more of them and so on. And what they would do it, again, this is pure speculation because it would have, how knows, but it's a fan speculation archeologist suggest that a, they would have these rituals in front of this painting where they mimic Hanton and then they would mimic, you know, caveman and cave woman every grindy sweaty dance scene, semi sacks, kind of like modern hip hop kind of thing.

Speaker 4:          00:25:06       And that would be the beginning of at Allegion because they are trying to influence the universe so that the animals have more sex and there's more of them to come along the next time. Wow. They thought it could be thought of bullshit cause I mean I would the you're not really an archeologist basing it on three pieces of information left 15,000 years ago. But it sounds fun

Speaker 1:          00:25:26       and we, we should clarify that you actually know what you're talking about. Unlike most of the time that these discussions get brought up on this podcast. You're actually a professor you teach. Where do you teach at? I teach at Santa Monica College and Cal State language. And uh, what is your education?

Speaker 4:          00:25:41       I started out, when I came here I did a, I did my ba in anthropology but then I hated it and then I did the Nma in American Indian studies of all sayings and uh, I need a second. The main he story and I really, I mean bottom line is there was mandatory military service in Italy and you could be fair eighth as long as you wearing

Speaker 1:          00:26:00       cool. So I was like, I'll do another masters. No problem. I just, we'll do the Indian studies wants to be an interesting, that's fun. It was. Or what the fuck. I got really into American Indian history a few years back and I read a, a quite a few books on it. It's an amazing case of genocide. I mean, people really can't even wrap their head around how many American Indians died. 90% of our whole population of wipe it out. And that's how it's horrific, horrific stories. You know, I read some soldiers of counts of what they did to American Indians and uh, it's uh, it's horrific. You know, it got really terrifying like serial killer stuff. You know what they would do, just heartless Ruth, like the, they treated them like they were not, not even vermin, you know, a lot of

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       that is actually tied to religion because the first way to um, kind of dehumanizing somebody is what I mean, we throw the Western religions, they have this division between God and the devil. Absolute good and absolute from heaven and hell. So there are the good guys are follow God and then there's everybody else. Cause, I mean if there's only one right way, then the idea is anybody who doesn't follow hours by default is on the wrong side. And if you think of that a couple of steps for it or done, then that's what it leads to. You know, in the idea of you guys are the servants of the day while they are not really human anyway, this low 30 new left and right is it's an act of justice as the, that's why I don't mind. I use these in class all the time cause I have a blast.

Speaker 4:          00:27:25       Uh, everybody, even if they never read any of this stuff, I've heard about the whole uh, story about Moses and the 10 commandments and so on. Then after that I ask my students about what happens right after that story. Cause that's where it gets juicy and they're like, ah, I don't know. Something, it wasn't golden calf or some crap. Like the, some of the Jews are not worshiping the one God. I'm like, yeah, yeah, that's right. And what does Moses do about it? Right after getting the 10 Commandments? I Dunno. Like he gathers, there's a, the law, your list, you know the streak, monotheistic people who are still on his side. He tell them, hey guys, you know, those are our friends. They're our neighbors. Some of them are family, but they're worshiping other gods. We can't have that. So you know what to do, get your weapons. Let's go from one side to the camp of the either and killed them all. And so right after the 10 commandments, you have a nice story of some 3000 Jewish tribes. Then being hacked to that by the monotheistic Jews against the polities stick. Joe's,

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       Jesus Christ. But I lead those mass sucker right off the bat. Wow. They are like Moses or nope. That is ridiculous. That's why. That's amazing. It's amazing. And this is the Old Testament, the old testament. So freaky. The Old Testament is just filled with freaky. It's like one of the most psychedelic bizarre books. You know, the, the, just all the stories. It just genesis and it's so much in there that's like, wait a minute, what? There was a fucking talking snake like, come on man. The devil appeared as a talking snake and talked him into eating a fruit. It was just a piece of fruit. That's all they had to do. Just a piece of fruit. That's hilarious. You know that God is just, he's rules are soft. Fucking serious. You eat my fucking apples, bitch. I'm not just going to punish you. I'm going to punish every fucking person from now till eternity. As long as their people, the people are fucked because one dumb bitch, eight an APP. It's my fucking apple. That amazing. You don't understand. Funny. I'm afraid you got your mellow out. Should God, what the fuck man? God, you need to smoke a joint and use some of your own creation. It's amazing how ruthless the the like when you go back in history, how ruthless God's war.

Speaker 4:          00:29:38       Absolutely. No, that's why if it cracks me up when you, we like could he Stanford, the

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       mantle is complaining about Hollywood, about all the sex and violence because if you look at the Bible, there's, I mean it's awesome. There's more sex and violence seemed to Bible than any Hollywood movie I can think of. You know, he gets so insanely graphic that is like Dame really, this is what, yeah, it's amazing too. How many of the stories are like really similar to all older stories from other religions? You know, like the one, the one that always got me was the epic of Gilgamesh and the story of Noah Arc, they're so similar and it's like, it's like really, it's like, I wonder what really happened and my speculations, totally speculation as there probably was some sort of a great catastrophe a long time ago. But of course in every giant tsunami or flood, it's not everyone that dies. Some people are going to live and the people that live, they're going to have to have some story for how they lived and you know, a couple of generations in when everybody's still live in like a monkey, you know, running around collecting fruit, trying to get their goats to fuck so they can kill them and eat them, you know, and just wondering how they got, why we seem really intelligent.

Speaker 1:          00:30:48       How did we get to this shitty point? Like w how can we now you fucks and figured out tools or clothing or houses or anything yet. Well, a long time ago Noah was the only person and we are the child children of Noah. It doesn't even take into account that you know how many, how many people were with Noah? Everybody came from Noah. We're wears black people come from, what about Chinese people? Yeah. How's that happen? How long does it take before, I mean Noah only supposedly it was a couple thousand years ago. Right? What was that 3000 years ago or something like that though. You have like 6 billion people. It was that possible that says luck is that this is the dumbest shit ever, but it's probably the original story was probably an actual event. Like I think most of those, those depictions were actual events. It just got distorted.

Speaker 1:          00:31:32       You know the, the, the, the, the telephone game. Like you tell a friend and he tells a friend or was it called top operator? Yeah. I mean by the time you get to the last person and this, you know, that's actually finding out your butt and get up because he's one of the ways in which I can got a sources. So when we talk about religion in class and I bring gap, when I speak off the Bible, I tell them, you know, how do you come out? How do you know that this is the real stuff? And I tell them, you know, really we have been talking about an oral traditions for generations before anybody write them down and they saw asking him, have you guys ever played over eight 30 or nine? Do you know how that works? And then you ended up so picture play, operate there for maybe 50 hours and then you had a cord, all the answers. And then 200 years later somebody come around and look at the answer and decide which ones are true and which ones are not. And that's the word of God for you.

Speaker 1:          00:32:19       Yeah. Like wow. Tried to ciphering that. Then people will fight to the death over those, those beliefs. Lethal call map with theater or Dara to change the meaning that's I need to cut off your bolts and board. Well, I bought the fact that, you know, like even the shit that was written down when they wrote it down in ancient Hebrew, ancient Hebrew is a very bizarre language and it doesn't have, they don't have numbers. So letters double as numbers. So there's a numerical meaning to words. There's a different grasp to the words that we can really barely comprehend. And these words [inaudible] numerical content was very important. Uh, for the actual meaning like the word God and the word love. They have the same numerical content and there was, uh, you know, a translation from that too raw to, to Latin and then to Greek. And if they're doing that, I mean, Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:33:17       What w what are they? Gonna I mean, how do you even know what the fuck was the original word? Oh yeah, exactly. On the telephone. After you played for the long and somebody decided then you'll translate it in a bunch of languages and that it's like, no, there are so many few authors to go through it. I woulda hell knows what it was at the beginning. And people have to make decisions, you know, like they have to decide like what goes in and what goes out. You know, how to like the King James version and you know, the, the whole idea behind the new testament is just so preposterous. If you find out how it was created, it was Constantine a bunch of bishops, right? I mean constantly was against their best Calico's it's just about, you know, where's Nadine enemies and he's the guy who pushed out or I need those that are formed that, but increased the idea is why.

Speaker 1:          00:34:01       And he's like, I don't know. That's the guy you want to have in your car and therefore, yeah, that's the guy that's creating the Bible. You could fucking crazy. It's amazing because you know, people will say, if you bring up the Bible would bring up crazy stuff that oh, that's the old testament. We go by the New Testament that the new testament was written by a fucking murderer. Even that is bullshit because it's, they only say that about the old testament when the old testament is solved Zilliow Virta topknots that it's embarrassing. Then anytime it say something that they want it and that's not in the New Testament, he's like, hey, it's in the Bible, but I'm like, no, wait, that's the book you just told me that he doesn't count. No, but when he'd say something, he law. I like Danny counts. How do you deal with that as you know, as, uh, when, when you're trying to, when, when, when people are teaching it and when you're trying to, you know, studied theology.

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       How do you mean? How does anybody go? Why? I mean it's, it's how many people who were actually studying theology are religious and how many of them get to a point where they become agnostic? Eh, it's, I guess it depends where they do it. You know, if they do it as some hardcore Christian school, well that's going to be one type of clientele. If they do it more in public schools. When I first started teaching the history of 30 John's class, I thought, shit, why did I get myself into, you know, I'm gonna I was all excited until five minutes before and then I'm like they are going to kill me. You know what I'm going to worry about that like with like Muslims are like the most is that the people reaction, that stuff arrow that id open minded. Otherwise they wouldn't be taking it because they don't want to eat it. Right. So most of the people who do show up are the ones who have a more minded approach

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       and so on. So they are cool, you know they, there are people to order, we lean to chat and engage and so on.

Speaker 1:          00:35:43       If you, if you have a mind and if you can think and you start studying religion, it's almost impossible to not be agnostic. I mean

Speaker 4:          00:35:51       rarely stickily again nobody knows shit wanting some kind of absolute answer where there is none. It's just showed that you are so damn fearful that you just want to ignore any evidence in order to decide the,

Speaker 1:          00:36:04       I need some serotonin. It's also very weird characteristic that people have to need closure and to need a side to be on, even though there's no answer yet. We haven't reached that point yet. There's, there's a door you have to open that door is death. When that door opens, you'll get some more information. But who knows? You might not be, maybe not, it might just be a baby in 1950 [inaudible] you know, to say it is like, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, look, it's bizarre enough that you're a person bizarre enough to use your eyeballs to judge distance. You have these fucking organs inside your skull that measure light, right and distance and they figure out exactly, precisely how far away you are from things and that allows you to get into metal boxes with rubber wheels. And that's just as bizarre as coming back as a baby in the fifties you know, everything we do is bizarre. No, you've had the university's amazing. I mean, it's so weird

Speaker 4:          00:36:56       that it's beyond anything I can understand and precisely because I respect it and I may know of it. Trying to make it all feet in my little box of bow. Every sing is supposed to work is bullshit.

Speaker 1:          00:37:07       The best quote ever heard of it from JBS Haldane who said, not only is the universe queer than you suppose it's queer than you can suppose I can sign up for that. Yeah. Get it right. Yep. That's it. So fucking what is, what the fuck is that ridiculous. So when you got involved in religion, did you originally get involved with it? Because from an archeological standpoint, no, it was a,

Speaker 4:          00:37:32       it was like God, I got the involved with just about every saint gods completely. By chance. I mean, I wasn't willing to wait. That would that add to for myself, I would read mainly a lot of eastern philosophy and stuff like that that I was into. But I would read for the hell of it. And the, um, somebody down, when they ask me, hey man, we need somebody to teach this thing, can you do it? I'm like, no, not really. And they were like, no, come on, you're kind of thing around. I said this man, you know, a lot of chefs do it. I'm like, okay, sure. And I jump on and I'm like, yeah, I love this stuff. This is fun. I got to talk about all the stuff I like and this is awesome. And so then I started reading more and more and uh, but I mean, yeah, I mean, I read my stuff before it will begin.

Speaker 4:          00:38:07       Wait, they didn't know in their moment of pure perversion, I decided to read the entire Bible cover to cover when I was 18 the most painful experiences of my life. But that's what got me up though. When I got to this part, uh, the song of Solomon, there's, be able to have that book ended up in the Bible is awesome. It's like one of the best things, all of a sad. Then you have 10, 15, I forgot how many pages where they don't mention God ones, they don't mention police, they don't mention anything. It jazz, the super passionate, erotic love poem between a man and a woman. A woman we enjoy sex as well is also from our point of view, which is completely unheard of in the rest of the Bible. And he's just the celebration of sacs essentially. And they just like, I always like how the hell it is. And that been very or no. And my theory is that one of the guys who are copying all the scriptures got drunk one night and took the wrong scroll and got this homemade power and area

Speaker 1:          00:38:59       by mistake. It's awesome. You know, it's uh, sum is it, do you know of a John Marco OLED gross work?

Speaker 4:          00:39:06       I heard of him. Um, I heard of him a bunch, but I haven't read him actually directly.

Speaker 1:          00:39:11       He's the guy that was one of the, um, the people that was working on the Dead Sea Scrolls who's working on deciphering it. And uh, he was the only agnostic of the group. And he wrote a book called, we wrote a couple of them. One of them was called the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian myth. And the first one was called the sacred mushroom and the cross. And that one's fascinating book. It's a, he believes that the entire works of the Christian religion were originally, um, mushroom. It was about mushroom eating and, um, psychedelic drugs and, um, ritual sex and about a fertility rituals and making sure that they kept breeding and that, you know, women kept having babies, shit that was seeing swale wrong. Isn't that amazing? That's, and he said his, he tracks down the word mushroom or the word Jesus rather to a, a, an ancient Sumerian word.

Speaker 1:          00:40:08       The roots of it being an ancient Sumerian word that means a mushroom covered in God's semen. And that the idea he believes, and this is, I mean he's making a big reach that I don't think unless you have some sort of serious education and language history, you could totally even grasp the argument. But what he's saying is that what they used to call a mushrooms, they, it was, it was like a, God would come on the earth when it would rain and then mushrooms would grow out of that. They would eat them, they'd have these incredible psychedelic experiences because of that. And so that was Christ. So Christ was a mushroom that was covered in God seaman. Well, I mean, you have stopped. You ever ready? Just thrown in the water?

Speaker 4:          00:40:48       Where's anything from [inaudible] to high? You ask our to a lot of psychedelic substances. I'm Anita Muskata, the mushroom itself, a bunch of scenes that have been central to people's religion because they open up all these words and so on. So, so

Speaker 1:          00:41:01       probably the early origins of a lot of the stores and a lot of the experiences and no wonder you start seeing, and we are dubbed, God's flying around, especially back when it was hard to get food. Oh yeah. And it was difficult when people were hunter gatherers essentially before religion was written down, people were, I mean, when they were supposed to be a hunter gathers up until like what, 10,000 years ago, 10,000 years, something like that. Although that's coming into dispute, you know, they found a fucking fishing hooks and fishing line and tuna bones tuna from 40,000 years ago and they don't know. They don't, they've never thought that people were capable of doing this. Now they're thinking that up to 40,000 years ago people were getting in boats and they were going hundreds of miles into the ocean and they were catching tuna. Dude tune up 40,000 years ago they were in boats catching tuna like they have no idea that that people were doing that.

Speaker 1:          00:41:50       This was, this is a complete like a new revelation. It's like going to rewrite history because they, I mean what kind of fishing line do you have that you're making 42,000 years ago that you can pull a fucking thousand pound tuna out of hundreds of feet of water and you've got to hook in some meat. What is going on man? How was that possible? We might have to like re wire the or rewrite the whole. I've been, I have a a very strong feeling that over the next few years there's going to be more and more evidence like this that makes people want to push back the origins of, you heard it go back to the Tempe. This, this new structure that they found in Turkey is another one where they're, they're, they're thinking they're going to have to push back the, uh, the origins of civilization because it's at least 12,000 years old and it's these huge like sculpted stone columns and they have all these animals that are drawn on it that don't even exist where you know, in, in Turkey.

Speaker 1:          00:42:47       So these animals like weren't even supposed to be in the fossil record from that back then. So what the belief is there, the, the current there, where they're trying to say now is that this was made by hunter and gatherers and a lot of people going, come on man. Like what the fuck is this? This is giant. Did just the fact that someone made something like this 13,000 years ago when we never thought people were making stuff like this. You might have to go, wait a minute, how much of this is really a leftover? Is there a bunch of stuff we haven't found yet? And if there is and we do find it eventually there's going to be a point in time where they're going to have to say, I think we've been around longer than we think. Not thought that and goes back to the we don't know shit.

Speaker 1:          00:43:22       Right. Yeah. That's why we are rewriting history all the time because I mean that's why you know you read the history books and you have like the last 50 years sees the steak and then the first 20,000 years he's like, okay, we already here for a while and then 50 or so ago these App Ben and he's like, okay, we don't know much. We also, we look so much different than anything else here. You know we are, we are some kind of an ape, but God damn, we looked different than the rest of the apes. How long did this take? How long did it take for us to look like this? You know, for east. Sure. Are you sure it's been a million years is maybe he's been to and if it's been too, that changes a lot of shit. You know, we don't really know. This is, this is a lot of guessing going on man. And how many, I mean did, did, was it a clean separation between us and the apes? No. Or maybe that hates to little cough, but if there's something that was super advanced, more advanced than us, we just haven't met it yet. Right. And it's here just hiding from us. Like, oh, those crazy monkeys there. It's just, you know, it's another couple thousand years ahead of us. Maybe that's what the aliens are probably not. Right. So, um, this Marco Allegro guy met a lot of controversy. When was trying

Speaker 4:          00:44:31       to propose that religion might, might've had its roots in psychedelic experiences. Why do you think people are so reluctant to take in that possibility? Cause anything, any kind of psychedelic experience is very individual. You know, it's hard to build that church on it in a sense that it's hard to have a dogma because it changes so much from one experience to the next, from one person to the next. And people bottom line loft dogma, that's the thing. Direct short them direct experience doesn't reassure them because they have to base it on their own feelings of their own in state on their own. And it's too scary for people. And now you, we are you. We are people. It took so much shit about why we like freedom. Most people are terrified, afraid of math. People hate freedom. You know they liked the idea of being free but they ran to their chains anytime they can because they need something to keep them safe, to make them feel like hey are okay, we are going to be fine.

Speaker 4:          00:45:21       You know? So I mean any direct experience, I mean think about martial arts, how long it took for people. Super attached to these is how we do things. This is the throat of combat. When in martial arts you can try it. You know, he's not like a religion where there's not as much direct evidence. You know, you can try it and still people would stick their head in the sand and no one has seats. That's some shit just didn't work. And it was fascinating that it's one of the most fundamental forms of competition. And yet we're way better at it now. And we have evolved it now over the last 20 years, more than at any time in human history, episode two. So you got to think people should have known a long time ago, but not really. Right? Because fighting is difficult and it's, it's dangerous and it's scary.

Speaker 4:          00:46:06       And most people try to avoid it if and whenever possible. So there's not a lot of testing it out. Right. And it wasn't until something like the ultimate fighting championship came along and we really found out what actually works. Now we know what fighting is. Now we really know what fighting is. That's amazing when you think about it, just as an archeological thing, you know, the fact that over the last 20 years they figured it out. Yeah. No, it's amazing. It's amazing. Even though the other day I thought that I agree with what you said, but I just saw the scene that cracked me up. I saw this Roman sculpture a few days ago for, I mean a picture where DERs, these, uh, the naked guys wrestling. No, not even. There's like these half man, half horse. Howard was called an English sense and Tara was putting some dude in a heel hook.

Speaker 4:          00:46:45       What's a minute tar and went to Sentara is the one with the bull. The center is the reform force and that's my favorite. The center hasn't there is and that guy is put in the heel hook onto somebody. Oh really? He'll hook by a cent or 2000 years ago. That's how they knew a lot of submissions that back then. I bet they had a couple of them are sub 30 cool sakes. But no, I agree with you. I mean the evolution over the last 20 years is unparalleled the way tiny singles before. That's why my dream would be to be able to have the UFC offered allegiance where that I learned at these people going off about these lamb is awesome. No, you're a soccer boot. These of is going to to like just shut up and get in a cage. I sit back have a BRC. What that said that we could stop whining forever, accepts it losses though. Not Bad. They always think

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       the guy got lucky and they want to come back and you know, Islam is going to make a comeback bitch. But wouldn't that be fun? That'd be awesome. Well, it's very strange to me when guys switched religions like, you know, like a dude will convert and become, you know, a Jew or you know, convert and become something else or a Christian or Catholic base it on walk more evidence. They found a better group of people to hang out with think, you know, it's what it is. It's like when you change nationalities. Yeah. You know, it's uh, it's, it's a very controversial thing, you know, when you become a US citizen or you know, when did you become a Unisis? Yeah, yeah. Was that a weird thing for you? I mean, for one, it didn't have to give up Italian citizenship, so it really doesn't change much. I can still travel. I can see that was bad ass dual citizenships cool.

Speaker 4:          00:48:13       The way I didn't have these, we are like, Oh shit, I'm Kathy, my cat in the bridges with the best. That's so I didn't have to do with that. So it wasn't a weird, you know, it's just like ass stupid piece of paper that I can go in line faster next time.

Speaker 2:          00:48:25       I've got a friend of mine who's got that Canadian American dual citizenship thing. That's dope. He goes back and forth with no problems. You can work over there and work over here. It's a cool, beautiful. Yup, Yup, Yup. Lots of very good gig. But when you signed up to the evil empire, when you signed up the final documents, we were like, oh my goodness, look what I've just joined up with. I just joined up with the baddest gang and human history and that's really what he joined. He joined the United States. I always say that the people in the United States that we are living inside the balls of the Dick. That's fucking the world. I like Gary mentioned mentoring play it, but we don't, we're not a part of it, but we, we essentially take residents inside the balls of the Great Dick that's fucking the world hundred different military bases in a hundred different countries or whatever the fuck we've got now. I love to write that down. That's awesome. That's what it is. You know, you just joined the best Bot. This is the best bot. It's safe here. Mad. We're just throwing a lot of punches. Everybody's back in the fuck up. We've got this thing circled everywhere else is quite dangerous. So, um, you, you, you got into this religion, you started teaching and you wrote this book. Now in, in writing this book, was there anything that you, you

Speaker 4:          00:49:36       found that you found the shocked, even you with all the shit that you know about religion? No. I mean I've seen enough stuff that I buy now. It's kind of hard about bringing the arguments with fundamentalist people. No, because I think one of the scene I tell them is that, amen. I'm not telling you anything about any single one religion because we teen any religion, there's so much variation that DDS agree on just about every sing among Christians among Muslims. I'm like, I'm just making a general point about where assert dine belief has led to do it. You want to identify with that. Good for you. You don't, but I'm not saying you're already John Equal this. I'm saying that as busy as the contents of your religion, but my low out of cause they don't take it. That's personnel. And then I tried to make it kind of fun and just play and laugh about it. So having a sense of humor, usually metal of the mouth Alito, so it doesn't get too, I've even had some hardcore weird fundamentals that I sold. They were out to kill me that suddenly loved me by the end

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       of class and I'm like, really? Have you been listening to I? That's where I think the Italian accent coming in. I don't think they understood a thing guy said, but it sounded cool. And so they were smooth talker and you obviously are well educated. So the words come out nice and dry and you know you're basically talking about the Bible and their little brains lock up. That is a problem too, isn't it a problem? There's some people are just dumb. Yup. I mean I'm afraid that's the majority of people and I don't think it's, I think a lot of people don't want to believe that it's a biological issue. A lot of people want to believe that it's an education issue or an environmental issue or cultural issue. And they may be, but it also might be, it might be biological, it might be, look, there's people that are born and they're seven feet tall, you know, there's people that are born, they have giant Dicks, there's the, you know, there's a great variation of human beings.

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       And when I just see this just giant wave of sloth, you know, you see like a giant percentage of people in this country, I don't know if it's 20% want to know what the number is. We just look at them. You're like, my God. You're like barely thinking. You're barely a person. Like are you just lazy or do you have like a nine volt battery kicking inside your fucking head? You know, they might have a nine volt battery, they might have shit jeans and a poor like database to draw from genetically. No one in their, you know, their, their genes, their ancestries had been any different than them and they've gotten this far, so there's no need to adapt. No. Yeah. So it's like, you know, you come across a wild pig or you come across a pig that's in a pen and they're, they're completely different animals.

Speaker 1:          00:52:00       Maybe that was what's going on and then it that case we're fucked. Yeah, exactly. Maybe that's why wars keep going on and maybe that's why religion keeps working. Yeah. Maybe it's like, it's almost impossible. Have you ever seen the movie idiocracy no, I haven't seen it. What I heard, it's funny, I just wanted to see that movie by now. I know I got upset because, um, a couple of people accused me of stealing the idea for that bit that I had for my special, the bit about the dumb people outbreeding smart people. Right. First of all, that's not a, an original concepts. I've been thinking that forever. Of course. And second of all, my special came out before that movie came out and it was something I worked on for years before the special. It's just a, you know, everybody's had that thought. So because of that I bought it and I never watched it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:45       I didn't want to see how close it is to my shit. You are paced. You know, you get in these, um, these defending yourself, there's no need to defend yourself and say it's gross when you, that's one of the things about communicating with people online is the anonymity and the deal. Sometimes you're, you're dealing with people, you're just dealing with like, why are you behaving this way? Like why are you communicating this way? This is the only way you do. The only reason why people would communicate that way is because there's a lack of social repercussions. Here's no can say anything and get away. You don't feel it. You don't feel it. You know, it's like the reason why people in their car can give you the fuck you fucking, when they wouldn't do that, if they were just on the street a few feet from, you know, that fantasy in a car right next to you.

Speaker 1:          00:53:27       They just, because there's a window and because there's a door and a window and a door and some space in between that they're like, fuck you, you fucking bitch. You wouldn't do it. Why you would do then the person you will to be a crazy person to do that in person. But there's a detachment because of the automobiles. We can't feel each other. See each other. We see we're separated by some shit and we know that it's safe. It's the same feeling that you feel when you're at the zoo and you know, you don't feel uncomfortable when you're standing next to a fucking bear. He's supposed to be shitting your pants when you're looking at the bear. Man, that is not normal to get comfortable looking at a bear. You should be terrified man. That fucking thing is only a few feet from you. Trust that glass. Let's get outta here. Yeah, man. It's uh, the repercussions of dealing with people answered that. It's very annoying. Do you, uh, do you post stuff on the Internet? You have blogs or anything like that?

Speaker 4:          00:54:14       I mean, my life has been so damn crazy lately that I've just constantly teaching and writing, teaching a badge. I mean, I love a lot of bad shit happened because my um, my wife died a few months ago. Charlie. Good man. We are all the baby. So you know, you can imagine that alone takes a hell of a lot of time and energy and everything. And then, you know, steel working in teaching, writing, doing. So I'm just like, you know, keep up on, you know, email, Facebook kind of stuff. But I've been trying to save whatever energy level after cause there's not a whole lot of, by the end of the day, you know, you're doing 7 million things at once. So yeah. Do you take a lot of vitamins and eat healthy and the to work on back, cause I feel it in my body and all last few months it's just too much stress, too much over the scene. So I'm just throwing, I'd been used to, you know, I worked out forever for 20 years now this last year I've hardly been able to. And so of course, you know, all of this stuff then takes a toll. So I'm trying to, you know, not become a, you know, the Unabomber or something. Got The for them evidencing that nobody body but at the same time save some energy for just beneath in, Ya know?

Speaker 1:          00:55:19       Yeah. That's important, man. It's important. It's very hard. Especially people with children with people don't understand when they have a baby. A is you, you now have a human being taken care of. It's not like a pet, not like you have to be with it 24 hours a day. If it's little and you have to take a shit, you know what you have to do. You have to lock it in the room with you while you're taking a shit or you have to like keep it from pulling the things out of the drawers and the killing itself, climbing up on something that they can't support. You know? It's like, it's a constant, like it's a lot of work. Yeah. So that anybody has kids. I'm like, how the hell does anybody do this know though is, and I love her. I mean she's not even a hard baby, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:55:56       She's an easy sweet bay steel. She's amazing. Nice. Yeah. It's, it takes a lot of energy and what you get out of it, their little drug dispensers, which you get out of it, is love and the purest form possible cut straight from the source. The love that you get from babies, man. Oh my God. You don't, people don't, who don't have kids really will never truly understand this experience because you can think you love a dog because you do. I love our dogs that see they're sweet and they give me kisses and I'm happy, but you don't. There's a feeling that you get when it's a baby that's your own flesh and blood, and they're just little bundles of love and they're a little bundles of happiness, and you can directly influence them. You can directly, you know, shaped their life and they're looking for you to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:56:41       And then they need you around all the time. And they constantly want you to hold them into, kicked them up and touch them. You know, the constantly screaming for you to touch them. You know, it's, it's amazing to watch that from the source, you know, to see an uh, you know, uh, uh, uh, a life form, a unique life form with no language that's communicating with just intent and noises. It wants you to do things for it and what it wants you to do is real simple, wants, love and wants to play. It doesn't want to be left alone. It makes sense. So much work. Yeah. So how do you, how do you, uh, keep saying, dude, you have like a workout you do or meditation or yoga or anything that I think on it. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:57:20       them right now I have been burning the candle on both ends. So I don't know that I have to go down and search your dad cause I don't think I've been doing a good job at hits. I think of being the handling things. But I'm feeding lately my body kind of giving me signals like, hey man, you are going over the edge. You don't need to tone it down, smoke cigarettes or anything. Do you know that's good. So now they workout has always been my thing. But then again, when you don't have the physical time anymore, we're and everything. So I need to find the tie ins to do it. And so that's kind of what I'm working on, on being able to just train again and do all this stuff. Cause I mean with martial arts I've been doing it 20 years. It's been like one of the things that you do day in and day out forever and suddenly you don't do that anymore. You're like, Oh shit, your body goes through withdrawal. You know, you feel weird. Do you feel, so it seems key to do it cause it doesn't matter how busy you get, it's key to your health in a way.

Speaker 1:          00:58:08       Yeah. I remember I tore a ligament in my leg. It was the first like real serious injury that took me out for months and months. I tore a knee ligament and how to get it reconstructed. And then I didn't work out for a long time. And it was the first time in my life that I hadn't done that. Right. You know? And I had always used martial arts for blowing off steam. And now all of a sudden I was at this place where I was like, wow, I just, I, you know, I, I, I'm not in control of my emotions as well. I'm like more short temper. I'm not in, I don't feel my body the same way. Like you know when you use your body a lot, you develop this like real tight relationship with your body. Like how it moves and, and it makes you want to eat healthy.

Speaker 1:          00:58:47       It makes you want to take care of it because you realize that it's communicating with you is communicating with you through movement and through, you know, your, you know, your desire and intent to do something and it's actual ability to perform what your desire and intent is and you get this relationship with your body and I didn't have it anymore. I had no relationship with my body. I was like, wow, this is weird. Everyday I just wake up and eat and piss and go through, you know what I'm saying? I just go to my, that's what I'm using my body for. It's just a vehicle I'm not communicating with. Welcome to the life of most people in the ward. Yeah. Right. You communicate with your body through things, you know, through sex, through, through martial arts, through dance, through the, you know, you communicate when you require your body to move in very specific ways.

Speaker 1:          00:59:26       Yeah. You know, and there's, there's, there's a consciousness to that that's, you know, very uniquely its own, the consciousness of the full couldn't cut the full focus and concentration of someone utilizing their body. You know, because I really do believe that that is an element of the whole, and that you have to, in order to be optimally healthy, you have to have the whole together and have to have the mind must be healthy. The consciousness must be healthy, the body must be held. Totally. Yeah. And I went through a long period, it was like six months, you know, rehabbing my knee after the surgery and everything like that where I still couldn't kick a bag, I couldn't box, I couldn't, couldn't run. That really says, yeah. It makes you realize, it makes you really fucking appreciate your body when you can though.

Speaker 4:          01:00:08       Seriously. So what martial arts where you're doing it? It's funny, I started out regionally, you know, with watching the TV series too many times I was dislike how long to go on the mountain with Master Yada showing me how to fly in the air. And it also started out with a lot of Chinese martial arts and then I progressively moved to more self defense oriented thing and then kind of AED opposite of what most people do. We start out with very aggressive and then they mellow out. I started out with the whole, it's all about Zan and boy three and thing and now and just like shut up. I just rice solely, just all about combat sports and the submission grappling in MMA, the kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          01:00:48       Well I think you know, there, there is uh, there's definitely a mindset to the eastern martial arts that is being lost in the transition to combat sports. You know, to look at in combat sports, there's, there's something to be gained from that mindset. What people don't understand is that like the, the ancient Japanese in a martial arts masters, you know, the reason why they practice Zen thinking wasn't because, uh, it's just, you know, a thing they did that you know, really doesn't need to be replicated today. Know what they were doing was in order to have a way, in order to have a way of thinking of life, they were disciplining the mind to behave on very specific frequencies and to have control over itself. And that in your discipline and in your honor and your code, you have control over your emotions. You have control over your body better. You have control over your psyche better because you have an ethic because you have a coat. And that there's, there's a reason for that. This is, it benefits you in combat. It benefits you to be sturdy of mind. So in order to practice this mental discipline, it actually puts you in a better position for victory. That's why it's there. Shut down.

Speaker 4:          01:01:59       I remember, I'm not the, I think are kind of a we pattern. So every time I've coached in photography, no I got, I got freaked out. I get scared when I have to fight. You know, some guys are, you know, you read a checklist dial or Randy, these guys who speak to date, they don't know what it means to be afraid. I'm like, what the fuck you mean? It's like the scariest thing in the world. There's this guy was being training to knock your

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       head off. So I walked up and the days before the tiny, when I stepped on the mat, I feel like every singing my body's shutting down. I'm about to die kind of feeling you every scene, freezers and, and so I can see how, you know, the whole zen thing is not about some having some strange mystical authorities about how the, you deal with the fact that this is what you're gonna do and you do it without too much attachment or because attachment will breed fear. Fear will shut you down and then you'll get killed. Yeah. You got to control your body. Yeah. That's really ultimately what it is. And the, the ability to control your mind is the same as the ability to control your body. Cause if you can't control your mind, you can't control your emotions. That can run a mock your possibilities.

Speaker 1:          01:03:02       The real problem is you're intelligent. That's the real problem. And it's true. And when you're intelligent, you realize, hey, we don't have to do this. This is an elective choice you're making to go and enter your body and just some physical combat with another man. That's, that's intelligence, that's intelligent. You're, you're, you're a smart person to think that way. Your body thinks it's going to fight, you know, and your body doesn't want to do it. So it starts, you know, just really essentially trying to pull you out of it. But I didn't have the same time. It's like the most instructive thing in the ward because he teaches you to get rid of attachments because you know, you'll leave with attachment of fierce and all these things about you hope that the universe is not going to do this and that to you and that you can end the realities in combat.

Speaker 1:          01:03:44       Like in life. You don't control Jack Shit, you do the best you can and then it's out of your aunts and you need to be able to live through it despite the obvious fear that kicks in from south preservation. And so he's like, hey man, bait man, maybe you die in a second. So what? It's not good. It doesn't feel good to work hard, but it's good to work hard, you know, you know, it's good. It's good to train hard, it's good to push your body and your spirit, you know? And that is a part of it. Your spirit, you know, I have friends that are men that have, and then I'm not talking about you, Brian, that are um, that have no experience whatsoever in, um, in any sort of difficult physical endeavor. And it haunts them. It haunts them. Like they get insecure when they're around guys who are athletic, it'll, they'll say, you know, dicky things and it's like to disarm this person of their masculinity because they've never truly face their own physicality and they're terrified of it.

Speaker 1:          01:04:38       It's fascinating. It's fascinating to watch. Watch some have like these little weird sort of semi meltdowns and they're around, you know, strong men and he's like the least you train the tougher you think you are. That's the way it goes. You know? He's like, no worries about, oh I'm this stuff got done. When you step up, you quickly find out that just guys are funny when they want to talk about Monday food and bar fights toy ya to four 15 times. It's like, yeah, it's fine. Oh, you're fine. 15 people that don't know what the fuck they're doing or your soccer punching people when you're envious, this no train at all and you've knocked down 15 dudes, I'm okay know you're going to get fucked up if you keep this up. One day you got to run into boss route and at the bar and he's going to fucking do what I was.

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       Instructional videos on your head, Bang, Bang, Sag. Imagine hope to put some the bully asshole and you run into a guy like boss and then a bar. Oh, what a mistake. Especially if he tries to be nice to you. And you mistake that for him being weak. Lipsey's yeah, we were watching, I had Eddie Bravo in here the other day and we were watching a Minotauro Nogueira versus Bob Sapp. Oh, that's awesome. That's classic classic. Brian, you, you saw it too because it's really, it was a, it was a cartoon fight, a real cartoon fight. And one of the, in my opinion's the best example of technique over power that this Guy Minataro this 230 pound guy was ever repeat this 350 plus pound monster of a man. Didn't even look real. That is an amazing, amazing fight. And that's a, I mean, that's a guy, I mean editorial, he's a, he's a real martial artist.

Speaker 1:          01:06:14       He is a, he's a real like true warrior. You know, a guy who became a master of Jujitsu and then became a great striker to add onto it and was just willing to fight anybody. And I think it started way back in the day cause I mean when he was, I forget Danny 11 whatever, when he had that car accident and he was sitting like hospital for like a year, a year where they tell him you'll never walk again. Maybe you law may be definitely no sparks and he goes on to become an MMA champion and say they'd say something about a guy's personality. I remember when he was at the top of his game, man, when he was triangling everybody and you know, you just saw you Jitsu on a level that you had never seen before. Like all the sudden this bad ass heavyweight who was tough as fuck though, who had a wicked guard.

Speaker 1:          01:07:00       Oh wicked Jujitsu game was hitting Anaconda chokes on dudes and fucking strangle him from his back and you're like, Whoa, do it is on another level. That was like, to me like a real victory for technique and mixed mixed martial arts in my opinion in editorial like embodies like this era where people like learn like Whoa, that's possible too. Like that was, we were not seeing guys on, on the highest levels submitting guys the way Minataro was not as you know, he's so awesome. How about the Cro cop fight? He gets battered by Cro cop in the first round, right fucking smashed head kicks by the guy who knocked out. Everybody would had cakes and somehow or another he eats it and he's okay and he gets up at the bottom of the round at the, at the end of the round he gets head kicked and dropped like seconds before the round ends and he thought the referee stopped the fight and the referee was like, nope.

Speaker 1:          01:07:51       The rounds over. He's like, okay, then stop this fucking fight. And he goes back and he takes him down. He armbars I'm in the second round, but he took up painting in that first round like, God damn, that dude is tough. And like, you've got to love it as a guys or stuck or rabbi or does the guys, all my crazy wars Sakharova by the time his career was over, he was essentially going in to the, to the ring with his legs. Mummify his knees were so bad that he would have the tape that would go all the way up to the top of his thigh and all the way down to his ankles. It was crazy. Yeah, that was a, that was another guy that was like a real, like classic technique, a technique and heart oversize guy. Remember when he fought Quinton Jackson and Quinto kept his land rover and he got his back.

Speaker 1:          01:08:33       I'm just flowing. I'm like, Jesus, how do you stay relaxed when some monster is lifting? Doing well. His Jujitsu was beautiful. He was so tough. He was so like willing to take punishment. You know, he was, he was technical, but it was also brave. He's willing to take punishment and essentially really, he should have been 170 pounder. Yup. I mean, he was walking around at 189 pounds without cutting any weight at all. And he was a little fat and he was taken on the heavy weights and he mentioned that he thought that was kind of a career he would have had that guy fucking beat Conan Sylvia with an arm bar. Remember that Shit. Kokona and went for a fucking Kamora. He spun around and caught him in an arm bar that was a pure victory of technique, oversize. That was a clear example of that.

Speaker 1:          01:09:20       He was an amazing fighter and know another one who was, you know, embodied that Japanese warrior spirit, you know, and that's what they loved about him and his willingness to go out there and throw it down with anybody, anyone, even Vendelay Silva who beat the fuck out of him three times. He kept stepping up, kept stepping up, man. And that last one, when he got knocked out and Vandelay caught him with two punches and it literally, he sent him flying through the air as he skid unconscious on his back. Like wow, the Melvin Manhoef fight when he fought Melvin Manhoef. No, Jesus, I feel bad for the guy. And he just took so many beatings. Oh my God. No one's taken more beatings and Sakharova dude, Melvin Manhoef is a destroyer. When that guy starts teeing off on you, he's one of the most terrifying strikers in any martial law.

Speaker 1:          01:10:06       You know, when he's attacking and he's just so strong and fast and just blasting Sakuraba and the fucking guy came back after that and he kept fighting. I mean he's, he's still fighting. Yeah, I know. I mean, I feel it's weird is perverted. Like, well I want to see him fight, but then I want him to retire, you know? Oh, I would love to him to retire. We can watch this old fights. So many classics. He was involved in so many fight of the year candidates, you know, I mean, even when he was broken up, when it was that like a year ago or two years ago when you had to fight with Gallese Guy, I think he was, or he pulled the guy in any bar and a guy like, he seemed like 50 straight times, no protection. And the guy stayed with it so he could get the knee bar and wind define how do you stay with that technique?

Speaker 1:          01:10:46       Fuck for, it's amazing. He's got unbelievable determination. What about the Xerox guys? Fight wears ear, fell off his ear. Literally it's, it's a, Sakharova has these gigantic cauliflower ears. So for people who don't know what that means when you wrestle a lot or you get hit in the ear a lot, when it breaks up the tissue, it fills up with fluid and blood and then it hardens it. Like it becomes like almost like Cartlidge like really fixed up and you have to have that cut out. And a lot of guys, they get an ear that becomes like this. I mean Lou or loose like a mouse is under their skin. It's, and that's what it looked like with soccer. Rob of the whole thing was deformed. Randy coture actually uses his in grappling cause it's hard, right? So when he takes guys down, he'll actually like shove his ear and to parts of them and make them uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:          01:11:34       He'll fucking jab them with his ears, man. Those are, those are hard weapons on the side of his head. It's really kind of crazy. But soccer rob was here was really fucked up and it had always had tape on. It was always getting cut and training and shed. And this dude hit him with something. I forgot what he hit him with, but the fucking ear was hanging off of his head. It was just hanging on and there's a romps. This is like, dude, you're fucking ear. Like even stopped fighting. It was like, Whoa, dude, you might want to look at that. What's going on here? They stitched it up as he fought since then he did. He's, you know, my rating. I hope he stops. He's not going to stop. He's not going to stop, but they're not going to have them stop. They're going to, they're going to keep asking him to keep doing it and he'll get doughnut. But I mean, if new hires Meyer to [inaudible], they would pay it and we'd like all the legends and then mellow matches and they would even make sense. At least throw him in with werewolves. Yeah. That's just fuck it up. Is He, does he still smoke? She, you know, I'd never known to reality. You'd always hear the story about hymns chain smoking and they can all the time. That's what I always heard. I think that's true, man. Yeah. Yeah. He trained hard, but I'm pretty sure he actually chained, smoked and drank.

Speaker 1:          01:12:42       They lead. Ever make a movie about that guy. He was amazing. Such a diverse culture because they are so by the book in so many ways. But when the guys golf model they really go, yeah, they get Mohawks and tattoo their whole body. And there's one guy I had, I love this guy that I put in the book isn't there is eat Q is the zen master from, I want to say the 39 [inaudible] 49 or something like that. And this is your book on the Warrior's path. These one is the one that's called religion, religion book. This dude was the illegitimate son of the emperor of Japan. And so they add to kind of his man, just hit him in a monastery somewhere so that he wouldn't get killed. Imbalance, conspiracy, trying to get rid of the possible here. So you know, this poor kid grew up in the middle of this fucked up zen monastery in the cold and whatever, just trying to stay alive and so fine.

Speaker 1:          01:13:33       You know, not the most fun in the ward, but he goes up, no way. Absolute genius. Everybody said, Jesus, nobody get us Zanda way. This guy does his sorts marriages. So these is so that precisely because he's so smart. He just flipped him off one day and he decided when they give you mean Zandy every seen, they called the certificate of enlightenment where a master certified a yard. Truly enlightened. Wow. He picked it up and he was like, certificate of enlightenment. Are you fucking kidding me? You know, he burned it and he was like, come on. You know, and that that is pretty, pretty fast. I sued. Really mean and trying to keep him in the fold by giving him, you know, will make you add both of these mourners. Three step a week later, nobody can find him. They find this poem that he left behind saying, [inaudible] Jesus a week in this monastery.

Speaker 1:          01:14:18       I can't take it anymore. If anybody's looking for me, I mean they're at the brothel or at the Saki sharp and that's the rest of his life. He goes off being does cut off one. That in teacher was main passions are Zana uh, hookers and sad. That's all daddy loves, you know, eat Q is a key. K why you wow, it's my full time here. I loved it. I loved that he figured it out. Yeah. It sounds like my friend bad, Bobby Bobby from Vancouver, he figured it out. Hookers and just Saki bezerk and end to him is Zen and uh, it was all to heat it to he Maria Zan was leaving life with full awareness. That is then you can do it. Meditating in a mountain, if that makes you feel good, you can do it in a brothel if that makes you feel good.

Speaker 1:          01:15:06       It's about having full awareness. It's not about what you're doing as much as about whether you are awake and the are alive to what's going on or whether you're going through the motion and you're not really there and whether or not you're just reacting to every single thing mindlessly around you. And by the way, there really is no true enlightenment because even true enlightenment for a human is just true enlightenment for human. Our little brains can't really, we're not set up right. We have, we have, we are essentially just like this old shitty computer we have that's running all this equipment. We were really do not have the hardware to deal with the scenario at hand. We're fucked. So even enlightenment for a person that's just enlightenment for a person, you know, like the best you could do is keep it together mildly. Cause I mean, you know, I mean it's, it's so funny.

Speaker 1:          01:15:49       It's was like, you know, everybody is searching for that and you know, what you're searching for is ultimately a better feeling about your experience here. Right. That's what we're all searching for. Whether it's through religion or through meditation or through Yoga. I have a friend who their family was very religious, uh, until recently, like a few years ago, they started to kind of, I don't know what, what brought him out of it, but they started kind of see it differently and now they're experiencing their first year or two years completely away from their church and the wife is starting to get into yoga. And you know, the dude is like, we experiment with a bunch of different things and just trying to figure out what the fuck is going on in the world. But it's weird to watch someone come out of it. It's weird to watch someone go, you know what?

Speaker 1:          01:16:33       Maybe maybe this is a mistake here. Well you guys are nice. I enjoy hanging out with you. But Shit, come on. Like they're, their own mind has evolved their, their, their personal consciousness of all past an ideology. Right. And that's a big decision to me. Very hard. Huge. It's bigger than breaking up with a girlfriend. I don't know about that. But it depends on how religion you are religious you are. But if you're like, I'm really active with the church and then you're going to lunch, it's an arm, it doesn't get any bigger. It also depends how tight that girl is. Yeah, yeah. That's true. Right. And whether or not she's a freak. Yeah. Whether or not, you know, just turn it loose for one day. She's loyal, but you're trying to lose from one day and she's in a fucking gang bang. And you can't take that gang bang back and there's a thing where she always really wanted to get with a black guy, but she never had no.

Speaker 1:          01:17:22       The mom when she's loose, do you see that video of the octopus walking out of the water? How creepy is that? Well, you know there's a video of an octopus climbing out of its aquarium, walking across the floor and going up to another aquarium that's in the same room and eating fish and then climbing back and as aquarium. Yeah, we're seeing some, I know this, I haven't seen it, but the reason why I know this is because a friend was trying to explain to me how intelligent octopuses are that they can take food and put it in a jar and the octopus, we'll unscrew the jar and get at the food and that a guy was missing some of his tropical fish and he had a couple of fish tanks and one of them was right next to, you know the octopus is right next to this one with like, this is really expensive fish.

Speaker 1:          01:18:05       It's fucking octopus was climbing out, climbing up into the next tank, lifting the fucking lid up and getting inside and eating the fish and then climbing back to his place. Put a time. So I really thought about it. It's like, listen, if I hang out here, this motherfuckers going to know that I can get it to this tag. You know? So the dude had a set up a camera. He set up a camera and caught this octopus. Still haven't seen the video though. So it might be harsh. It might be in that legend tweet. Yeah. Tweet it. You, you whoever's listening where there's enough people listening. We don't need to tweak this. This is ridiculous. I'm going to leave it at that, Brian. Um, no, I mean, I tweeted so I can see it. I don't know if somebody, yeah, if they find it folks tweeted, yeah, somebody, if it's out there, it might not be out there.

Speaker 1:          01:18:48       I might not be real. But, um, uh, how do we get on this subject of Octopus's killing things? If the climbing out of being intelligent, you have it. You've seen the, uh, the, uh, evidence for a cracking. Have you seen the evidence for a giant octopus of legend? You know, there's always been a legend of an octopus that can devour ships and you know, a huge whale eating well, they actually have found evidence of this thing like a really boy inside of your octopus. No, they found, they actually found whale bones and the whale bones are fucked up. And so that means there's something that is big enough to go kill a god damn well. And they also found fossilized imprints of giant suction cups. And that's what leads him to believe that the possibly, see, the thing about an octopus is there's no bones really.

Speaker 1:          01:19:39       There's nothing going to be left. There's no fossilize octopus. It's not like a bird or something else where you can get the structure of the animal. There's, you know, it's essentially all soft tissue except for its beak. So it dissolves. It doesn't exist anymore. But it was on the ocean floor that they had these imprints. He's fossilized imprints of what looked like massive suction cups of a huge tentacle. And by that they're, they're making this pretty reasonable hypothesis, you know, and the, the bones of the whale being all fucked up. And then these giant suction cups, they're like, oh, they're probably was this real monster but lived. I mean, if there's a whale, why wait? Just a whale's ridiculous. And it's right there. It's weird as it gets, man, a super smart, giant big thing. They can't do anything and it has to breathe air.

Speaker 1:          01:20:27       You know, like why it lives in the ocean and it breathes air like Watson. I know. That's so stupid. You know the design that I didn't quite workout. It lives in the water but yet can't, it can go down the water for a little bit, but it's got to come up for air and then it can't even stop. It can't stop because of it stops. Then it'll fucking sink and then it'll drown. That's fucking, how do they, do they even sleep? They don't even sleep. They think they like, like dolphins. They're like partially sleep. I'd be like shut most of their brain off for a couple hours a day. You see this video, the octopus eye opening the jar to get the food inside and then shutting the jar. Oh yeah. I have seen this. Yeah. Have you seen the OCTA? Was Jack the shark? No. What?

Speaker 1:          01:21:08       Yeah, there was another one in the aquarium. They're finding a lot of sharks were missing. They're trying to figure out what the fuck was going on and uh, they put a video camera up and they saw you watched. That one definitely exists. If you look for a octopus, each shark and it's fucking awkward. Let's just jump on the shark and Jack theme. It's just Jujitsu. Once they get ahold of his body, he's, he's helped eat them. Yeah. You know, it's really simple. Everybody thinks all do. Who would win and shark or an octopus? Oh Dude, for sure. Shark the fuck it would. Right? It's supposed to move fast. Shark is stupid. They try to fight you. He just wrapped that bitch up, watch this shit. It's kind of crazy. It's hard to see on this TV behind you. Yeah. The, yeah. There you go. TV buying, and I could look at this one back here. Well, this is act two was just fuck the shark up, man. This shark was like, yeah man, I'm a shark. I'm just going to fuck somebody up today. That shark never thought that anyone is going to eat him. Sharks don't even really have any natural predators. You know what I mean? Well, the flux run around eating sharks. Occasionally an Orca will kill a shark, but they only do it because the sharks are too close to their babies. They're not like trying to eat him. It's pretty rare.

Speaker 1:          01:22:10       Look at this stupid fucking shark. Yeah, man. I'm just running shit down here. That's a live one right there.

Speaker 5:          01:22:21       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:22:22       that's crazy. He's waiting. How long can the octopus live outside of water? That when I saw that video I was like, isn't he? Doesn't he need water? I don't know, but lobsters are skin live outside a long fucking time. You ever got a lobster in the mail and they're nice. Yeah, you can do that in the mail. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah, and they're on ice. It'll get it. Here he goes, bitch, come here. Shark swims over the octopus. The octopus just wraps this bitch up with some like raw jujitsu. That's total Jujitsu, bro. Look at his hooks. Yeah, he's got his back. He's like, oh no, no, no, no. My friend right now, this is della Hiva guard cause he's trying to get away. It's like our Masa. He's trying to bite them to the shark. Might bite him a little, but you know, here's the crazy thing about us.

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       Or you can bite their limbs off. It doesn't matter. Bitch growing other one, they grow another one. They're super is the super adaptable. So this shark is biting them, but so what? And he's just getting jacked. He's getting totally Anaconda in here. Spun around. Yeah, there there's suction cups are bad ass man. It's a bad ass design. You know, everything just pulls it into one center where there's a giant fucking beak and that beat just jacks your Hass. Wow, that's cool. That's nature. Meanwhile, that's crazy thing is their eyes and our eyes are very similar. They're very similar biologically, which is amazing. Like me, somewhere along the line, some hundreds of millions of years ago, we were probably cousins of an octopus and then we branched off into different ways in the ocean floor. And you know, we went one way, they went another way. They went this way of just blending in their environment and Jack and sharks. And here we are jacking the world. Awesome. Um, so back to religion. Let's come back to it. Did you, um, what did you ask? Did I ask you, um, what was the oldest religion?

Speaker 4:          01:24:13       Yeah, I mean I guess some form of Fannie Mae's him. He's basically, so you were telling me about the cave, for lack of a better term, a scholar Scolito animism or shamanism or however you want to call it. [inaudible] Jones. And they have, you know, enormous variation from one tribe to deny that, but they have some common themes they tend to see like the nature as alive, you know, in nature is alive. We'd speed eight to spirits and everybody seeing from threes to animals to all sorts of stuff. Did. I kind of like star wars that there's a power in everything forced to watch like in a forest. Exactly. That you cannot be in 20 times. No, morality is not about, you have to be a drink first. Right. So there's, there's some cool stuff out there that's uh, but um, but yeah, he vats that Amanda's we from one type to the next and it wasn't written down, you know, it wasn't an organized or you joining that sense. And I mean some of that's two likes these do these day, you know, and some tribal culture. It's was steel. What's going on?

Speaker 1:          01:25:02       What's the official a belief as far as like, you know, what's taught in schools when it comes to cattle worship? Why are there so many cattle worshiping trials? Delicious. Yeah, exactly. That's, that's definitely true. That's they worshiped them as gods and they don't even eat them in some parts of the world. Right. In the eye and stuff. How much does that have to do with psychedelic drugs?

Speaker 4:          01:25:22       So that's why with the theories about Hinduism is about how a lot of it began with Salma and saw him. I was going to see there to be some people say was Amanita Mascara, you know, the marsh or Amanda,

Speaker 1:          01:25:32       they say that they also say strew Feria cubensis and they say, and it might've been um, a combination, sort of a cocktail that they put together right now it's amazing that if you know about the, their religion and the place that Soma played in it, that it was lost. Like we don't know what it is. Yep. No names. They would talk about Salma being greater than all these different things and Soma being amazing. But yeah, we don't know what Soma is. Somehow or another they lost with Soma is there's that guy a garden west. And actually I think I was in the book in there too, cause

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       it was too much of a fun story. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. That chapter in title the piece drink I, how do you, how is it that one go

Speaker 1:          01:26:12       and Watson is the one who initially made psychedelic mushrooms popular with a western America. Oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:26:18       I read a chapter entitled Peace Drinking piece of drinking draggy priests created into Islam because it's one of the theory that Western as about that is that he believes that he believes he was at many times carry out this summer. And the way he figured it out, he went through a bunch of these books are referring to Sam and he was saying, you know, they keep talking about a plant but they don't talk about leaves. They don't talk about, you know, they refer to stem, they refer to somewhere crap. Right. And then so he was thinking he was starting to go into mushroom direction and then he finds out this piece of literature or from somewhere else where it's some Shyman in Siberia I think was talking about how they feel terror Amanita Muscarella and he had read about these three pl field. Third are they using for some hour? They do a couple of sinks to better wait. And then there's a human filter and he was like, what the hell is a human filter? He find out that if you take Amanita Mascara, you'll get the high by yours. So guy the really nauseous and

Speaker 1:          01:27:11       in your purse or your drink, somebody else getting the high, but they get stuck with a crappy part. They get all the side effects. Your dog. Well, I know that people drink their own parents when they're tripping it take an Amnio or when they're taking an fairy cubensis they'll drink their own urine and they blast off. Apparently I talked to this dude, he was like, I was like, I don't want to drink my piss. This is crazy. And was like, dude, trust me. Drink your like, he's like, I'm tripping balls and they're telling me I need to drink my piss to get higher than this. He goes, I don't want to get out in this, like trust me. And he goes, okay. And he goes, I drink my piss. And he goes and all of a sudden it was like a tornado opened up in front of my eyes and I got sucked through the center of it and said it was the craziest trip and the most enlightening trooper was life.

Speaker 1:          01:28:01       But yeah, it, yeah, that's at least is your own in these cases even closer because it's somebody else's, it just cause you don't want to get the side effects. But I may or may not have watched people drank animals pis who I may or may not. If I can't discuss money, she paid for that. I can't discuss this until now. It was in person. I didn't pay anything. I actually got paid, but it might not really be real. Uh, I can, and I can't discuss this till uh, ironically and a totally unrelated after fear factor starts hearing. Which Harrison?

Speaker 4:          01:28:31       Cool. Well, um, the human filter was a popular thing. People would just sell their own. Would they sell it where they just make a deal? I'll tell you what, like why line in some 40,000 year old book or something so nobody really knows. And he could be the west. He speculating going off the deep end with that. Could be, but it's an interesting, it's a fan theory if nothing else.

Speaker 1:          01:28:52       How many do Mascara is a very strange mushroom because they believe it's not only variable genetically, but it's variable by location seasonally. And that some of them might not even be psychoactive. There's some of them might not even work. Right. You know, I've, I've tried am Anita and to when nothing happened, right. You know, I tried to, I didn't, I went on a, a combat atory experience. We tried the Amanita, we tried it for a few hours and nothing took. So then we took some regular mushrooms and then we blast it off. So it was a combination of the two of them was like ultra potent. The emoney that did something weird, but it wasn't really like getting you off. It was just like getting you to this weird head space. I was like, Whoa, what's going on here? Like is this, this is what this stuff is like.

Speaker 1:          01:29:33       I just think it wasn't strong enough. It wasn't good enough. And I think, um, you know, there's parts of the world where it's like, Eh, you know, where they really know how to do it and we'll really in Siberia special ed. And it's fascinating. This thing about Siberia is how the Amanita Mascara mushroom is essentially Christmas. It's essentially Santa Claus. When people don't know that the, the Christmas theme and the mushroom theme are so closely related, they're eating the same color, right? How many Anita must grow mushroom is Santa Claus. It's red, you know, and it has a Michael Rise relationship with a certain coniferous trees so that it grows only under those trees, just like packages under your fucking Christmas tree. I mean, it's really amazing. I mean, and you know, and people would gather them and the way to drive them out was they would put them on the fucking trees, on the branches of the trees.

Speaker 1:          01:30:23       So the son would get them, it would dry them out. Like it's like, that's the ornaments on the trees. It's like all of it is there. It's like there's so many connections and it's been argued that, uh, you know, someone told me the Coca Cola was the first one to actually make a red and white Santa Claus. Then he was a different color before then. But that's not really true. Um, there's, there's evidence of red and white Sanchez from long time ago, you know, and, but that the Santa doesn't even matter. What really matters is the fucking presents under the tree the way you know, the, the relationship that it has with the tree. The reason why we have Christmas trees and they're always fucking pine trees, man. I mean, the whole thing, it's like, wow, it's, there's the relationship's so close, the look, the color of it, and the fact that we hang stockings over the fireplace and those stockings when the fuck did you ever get a pair of red and white stockings that you wore?

Speaker 1:          01:31:09       Right. You don't button through that tool, but that's also how they dry mushrooms out of their home. They hang them in front of the fireplace and that's what drives them out. I would say it's an incredible like series of, uh, whether they're, they're co coincidences or, I mean, I wouldn't say coincidence. I would say, you know, there's, there's evidence that there's a relationship and a, there's a bunch of people that have studied this. There's a guy a and Andrew Ruta g and a young urban, they've, they've done a lot of study on this stuff. And the, and the great, Jack Herer was actually writing a book about this before he died though the relationship with Christianity and a mushrooms as well. He had all these really cool ancient paintings of people who are naked dancing and the ecstasy under the very clear, transparent silhouette of a shape of a mushroom, you know, so it's really amazing stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:32:02       Like the idea, and if you ever look at the really old pictures of Halos that's as fascinating to old Halos, like the new halos or like a Frisbee or like a hula hoop proud and floating around the back of your head. But the old Halos, we're literally on the underside of a mushroom cap. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And it has the straw that little lines in it, just like a mushroom does. And it's, it's really a trip when you see that you go, oh my God. Like this is what they were saying was these people were under the spell of the mushroom. They were enlightened, right. Because they were under the spell of the mushroom. Right. And there's mushrooms symbology, like all throughout ancient buildings and like doorways or mushroom shaped like literally these, these, these temples had mushroom shaped doorway. Right. Fuck man. How many people were on mushrooms back then?

Speaker 4:          01:32:50       No, no Internet. No TV. You got to keep entertained somehow.

Speaker 1:          01:32:55       Yeah. That's the move, right? Yeah. Damn man. So when you're teaching these classes, do you ever get anybody who's angry at you? Do you ever get anybody who wants to talk to you after class and just like, you know, hey,

Speaker 4:          01:33:06       what you're doing is wrong or, no, for the most part airmail I mean, and again, I tried to do it in a way that I try not to be offensive to the individual. I may say something harsh. I always say something harsh about the big picture, but on the, on an individual lab and he's like, hey man, I mean, it doesn't mean I hate you. You know? It's like we're playing here, we're tossing ideas. I'm not attached to my ideas. That would be something that makes sense. I'll change my mind right now. You're always like, I'm not here to defend an ideology. So it would have been okay, ours, we're just playing, you know, so people in my little out and once, you know, why do we have discussions? I had a Muslim student who was very nice guy, but obviously wasn't too keen. He loved me when I talk shit about other religious, but of course he had to sub each.

Speaker 4:          01:33:43       That's what I started picking on the Quran. He had these, um, one thing I pick it on was this passage in the Koran, the basically justify beating up your wife if she's disobedient and uh, he's a nice guy, so he doesn't really want to support that. But at the same time he doesn't want to go it against the Koran. So he was like struggling and trying to figure out what do I do with it? He kept up with this weird ass theory a week later, tell him, you know what? This is God telling you that you shouldn't beat up women. And I'm like, yeah, that's the way it, except that it's saying that you should [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          01:34:17       She's like, no, no. He's using saboteurs psychology. You know, because he's, if he tells you not to, then you get pieces, then you want to do it. So firstly, wait, he said first Firstie Thal seal that you should talk to them. And then if they don't marry forum, then you banish them to another room and not only as a last resort, then you can beat them. So really styling, you know, you shouldn't be the map, but it's doing it in a smart way. And I was like, oh my fucking God, I it, can you just take them? Maybe there's some good stuff in the Koran and your cat, some crap. And can we engineer the most dogmatic slums

Speaker 1:          01:34:50       like radical Muslims are the most dogmatic about it. What do you find to be the most ridiculous? Is there are they are religions, ridiculous. The people, all the ones who believe that there's only one right way that has been revealed by God to damn. And so they are super hardcore to the magic. And mostly, I mean you're talking about Muslim fundamentalists today in particular, Mazda, fundamentalist Christian fundamentalists throughout metro fees. Three they mellowed out a lethal today. They let you paint them. Yeah, exactly. Draw Jesus. Mohammad a fucking shoot. You blow your house up. But uh, I think he's only in western Western monotheistic religions have the tendency to have, uh, an alt s more Arad bead die. It'll kill you if you disagree kind of mentality. Monster Asian seeing so, I mean, you can agree, you can disagree, but they are kind of like, Eh, you know, if you disagree with the hell cares, it's the years thing.

Speaker 1:          01:35:41       Yeah. Asian martial arts or Asian rather illusions. What about, um, what do they got? The idea that the most dogmatic and the most restrictive religions are really the religions that have come from the areas that have like the oldest civilizations. Right. And so almost like, you know, like, like sue mayor, which is where I rack is, right. You know, really famously is a part of the world that is still in the dark ages. Right. And a lot of ways, you know, the, the, the battles we're seeing the Sunni and the Shiites and the, just the, the, the Kurds and all the shit that happened with Saddam Hussein and, right. And you go back to that area. I mean you, you say, well, you know this, this area literally was sue mare. This is, there is Babylon. This is where, you know, the, the, literally the first religions were created as far as we know.

Speaker 1:          01:36:32       You know, and when you think about that, like the people that are still there, they're much more influenced by the deep, deep past, you know, then people that have spread out to all parts of the world as travelers, especially Americans. Right. That's the, the further, the last example of a new continent that we know that, you know, just over the last few hundred years it's been established. Yeah. I'm kind of scared of anything that comes out of the desert. The desert is a it up place. I mean it's just some people do well in it, but for the most part it's harsh. Environment matters, man. Oh, do you want to do is you just squeezed between two rocks but Ada, your brain, does it start oozing out of your hand? [inaudible] so it's like all religions that come out of the desert. I can see how the people that come out of the desert ridge drive from California to the drive from California to Vegas and he'd get out and you just smell crime dude.

Speaker 1:          01:37:23       Smell fear and anger. Fear and loathing. Right, exactly. At Arrest Thompson fucking nailed it. I mean, it's not a mistake that he drove in a convertible taking it all in while on ether. I come that, yeah, that's probably the way to see it correctly. No, so that's with the religions. I mean really jumped, come out from beautiful mountains and reverse and shit. I'm sure he's going to do something to its ideology where they are maybe not old ways, but for more likely than not, they're going to have a more mellow view of life. Well, there's only one really mellow religion, right? That's Buddhism led these amazing perky model. In fact, I have no problems with, I mean Sam bags. I can do that. Good. He read some stuff in Buddhism, but is it's pleasant disagreement, you know, it's like, and they are not as a, at least for the most part, as our core trying to shove it down your throat so it's a little more relaxed to have a dialogue that's really appreciate that.

Speaker 1:          01:38:17       I really appreciate religions that don't proselytize. I really appreciate it. Like two days. I'm like, nobody's trying to get you to be a Jew. Right, right, right, right. Yeah. And you really can't even join, you know, it's really hard to join, right? Yeah. You've got to marry some chick. You know, it's, my uncle did, my uncle converted name is Salvatore Digerlando. He could really became Jewish. Um, yeah. It's, um, it's interesting to me that, you know, there's no, uh, there's, there's no, I wouldn't say there's no new religions, but there's no new respected religions. There's everything where you can look back and feel like, you know, some people take Scientology seriously, but for the most part it seems to be just a group. You know what I mean? You can call it a religion, but no one in that really is believe, at least I don't think they are believing the stories of Scientology the same way that people are believing that ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          01:39:10       I mean, especially when it's written by a science fiction author, but because we know motor shit today, you know, it's like you can make some great claims about some of these 10 past where nobody knows shit. Then it's, you can spin a story that nobody can disprove today. Uh, you know, in three seconds people find out all about you where they are like, hey, either the, your profit, the guy who was like ranting some child porn the other day and he's like, what are you talking about it? So it's a little harder to get away with stuff. And you remember the uh, Ted Haggard documentary that Hbo and one of the things, he goes to look for a job and after he gets out and goes, oh, I think I'll be okay. Unless they Google me, I had said, he said, I think I'll be okay. I'll get the job unless they Google me.

Speaker 1:          01:39:50       It's great. It's Hilarious, man. That's hilarious. He's back to teaching again. He's got a church now. Let your love it does guys are so hardcore about morality and this and that. And they thought that they mellow out a little bit, which would be healthy. No, they go all like, I'll do methamphetamine with the gay hooker. That's one yard. The wine was ugly in that masturbation is the altity mets scene. And it's like Jesus said haggard. He blocked me on Twitter. Yeah, he did. I made a joke. He was talking about church is like after church may be, uh, you know, sandwiches and a picnic and then dot, dot. Dot. And I wrote math and blowjob. Yeah. I mean, but he's even by [inaudible]. Come on, man. You can't just, we'll leave that out there. He blocked me, blocked me on Twitter. The fuck. I block people too, but only when they're assholes.

Speaker 1:          01:40:42       If you say something that funny, but you know, some people that have got no sense of humor priest to get busted with gay hookers and math, the rarely can they laugh at it. No, unfortunately. Unfortunately. Yeah. So mostly the most unreal, reasonable religion would have to be Islam. Right. They're the most, they if you don't, I mean you can't make fun of them. You can't, today's pretty tough to do, you know, that woman that had to go into hiding and they had changed her name. Um, she, uh, was a, a calmness and she, she wanted to have a drama Hammad Monday and uh, she had so many threats against her life value. Yeah. They were really, they will kill you. Isn't that amazing? It's amazing that that's tolerated. Like that's some bullshit, but yeah. You need to fucking relax. Yeah. One thing that trips me out, what is the reaction like when they wear the Mohammad cartoons are nowhere, even salamander actually back in the day at branch of the Western world where saying, yeah, sure, de violence is bad.

Speaker 1:          01:41:41       The Muslim reaction by release this terrible and the fence if what these people are doing. And I'm just like, are you kidding me? You know, you're giving into burners and arguing that, uh, exactly what we want to squash, freedom of opinion. That's a, in the name of respecting religion. If you want to go to war, if United States wants to go to war, should go to war with anybody that wants to kill a lady who suggests that you should have a drama Hammad Monday, that's who she had a war with. Terrorism. Go to war with them. Have people that pretend to do shit like that. Find out who's ready to kill them and then go get them. Go get them boys. You know those, those, the jackasses in the world. Those are the people who you can't bounce that bar that far back from where they are.

Speaker 1:          01:42:20       They need to die and come back and live life again and try to learn from this life's experiences because there you're not going to bounce back from being a guy who is willing to cut the heart out of a woman who wanted to have a drama Hammad Monday you, that guy's never going to be a productive member of society. He's not like, oh, I, you know, I don't sleep well at the restaurant. Yeah, that's a pretty big cut floor right there. Yeah. There's like a number, like a, a place where you go where you can't bounce back when you're so much of a piece of shit and so much of a problem in society. The camp, I say child molesters, I say anything, anything along those murderers. Like you can't bounce back from that and you can't, you gotta stop. You gotta go. We gotta Clean House and it's just like you have to prune trees and you know, like you have to shoot horses have broken legs.

Speaker 1:          01:43:04       All right. Right Brian? Yes. Fuck we talking about, it's supposed to be about religion. So did you, you didn't learn anything doing this book, you will learn something about the reactions to people that when you praise yourself, controversy and even this conversation, you know, I'm sure there's going to be people, you're lucky you don't have a Twitter. See what is like, do you have a Facebook? Facebook? Yeah. Oh, what is it? What's your, is it Danielle? Billowing? Yep. I have a nice picture of me holding my daughter. Flipping people off. Really? Yeah. Wow. So you were preparing for this response from the shelf? Yeah. Did you do that in a response or you would like, that was my ethical though the last few months where I was like, I've been through enough share to, that's kind of my feeling toward the university. No one end, I'm protective of the, all the good theme there is. And then, yeah, there I, I'm like fuck you all. Is your go to Karaoke Song? I by Rem I chance no, it's Pavarotti. That's right. You got that accent. You might as well just bust out some opera and go for it. Right?

Speaker 1:          01:44:04       Is that you saying it over there? Yeah. Okay. You're all right. Don't hurt him. Don't hurt yourself over there. Um, so your book, when is it going to be out?
