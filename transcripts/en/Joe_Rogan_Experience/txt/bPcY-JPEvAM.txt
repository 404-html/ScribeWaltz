Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00:04       yes, yeah, yeah. Natasha, put your phone because you're trying, but the struggle was real. I wasn't sure it's not coming up. There it goes. This interface. It's very hard. It's very hard. Um, are you guys worried that by calling your tour endless honeymoon, you might put the jinx on it? Sorta like how rob and black China and doing a reality show. A jinx on what our marriage or the tour. We can pivot. We can pivot into the endless divorce tour very quickly, right? Because you guys will be friends. Even if you miss, you hit the rocks strictly homeys tour.

Speaker 3:          00:00:44       Well, the way we thought of it as we're in Newport, Rhode Island, we learned about this rich couple who went on a 10 year honeymoon and then they came back with four kids and I just thought that sounded so romantic to be so rich that you dislike. Went away for a decade.

Speaker 2:          00:00:56       Yeah. You have kids on the fly. You Go away, newlyweds, you come back. Grandparents. That's super bowl too. Like they don't even know their doctor. They're in fucking Sweden. There are rich people. Those people were so richmond. Do you know about the newport that the seat of wealth? That was newport, Rhode Island. Oh yeah. I used to do a lot of gigs in Rhode Island. There's Caesar's insane mansions. They're the in the,

Speaker 3:          00:01:19       well in the gilded age, 1900. Basically 90 percent of the wealth in America was in Rhode Island and then everyone else was living in squalor.

Speaker 2:          00:01:28       They hadn't established personal income tax yet. It was like the years right before personal income tax had been established in this country.

Speaker 3:          00:01:37       So people had like 35 indoor servants, 55 outdoor servants like you could. People would come from Australia and boats and you would just make them your. It was like slavery, but

Speaker 2:          00:01:47       the show, the endless listen to mature. We do an extended lecture on personal income tax and the history and slavery. Yeah, no. Nice.

Speaker 3:          00:01:55       So another period is based on that. That's how we know about it,

Speaker 2:          00:01:58       but yeah, they were like these people. It was the carnegies and the rockefellers and these like seat of power, like Illuminati old.

Speaker 3:          00:02:05       You had a billion dollars a hundred years ago. Like these people or they were just. But now we've come full circle and people have figured out how to legally steal money and not paying income tax. So but not that many. I mean the other thing, but don't like the Romney's of the world. Don't they know how to not pay or are you talking about? Well like the like politicians don't. They kind of know how to.

Speaker 2:          00:02:27       You're talking about. She's talking about big old corporate oligarchy billionaire people figured out any super rich people are going to try really hard to hold onto their money and pay as little taxes as possible and form llcs and corporations that don't kind of jazz. But it is funny. The comedians are like mostly super liberal and they were all like, man, we got Bernie and we gotta like pay these high tax rates and anyway I'm incorporated on my llc name is. Sounds like you're doing a corporate fiction too. Differ

Speaker 3:          00:02:56       for entertainers, but here's the problem. Like where's the going? Like I'd

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       be willing to give away more money and tax dollars if I knew that it was a rock solid establishment. They really knew what to do. And if you could pick, if you could tick like little feel, a little bubbles, like, oh, I like most of my money to go to education. No, nothing to. Nothing to that. That'd be amazing. Would be. But the country be fucked. Yeah. The roads to fall apart quicker. Everything would fall apart. You know, cops would be out of business. Well no, because half of the country at least would be like all my money. The cops, all my mother did defense. I would love to see. I would love to. I don't, I wouldn't love to do it because I just don't think that that amount of power should be in people's hands without a lot of research first. You know, I think that's big part of the problem. Even running for president and voting for president, you don't have to have any research done before you choose a candidate. You just like them. And also you don't have to have done any research to be the president.

Speaker 2:          00:03:53       I guess I'm a hillary person. Yeah. Yeah. You can become a hillary person just because you didn't want to reality show contestant or whatever the fuck you was. What? That's the crazy thing about, and I. I do think, I think we're talking about this last time. I do think trump, if he's doing anything good for American society, he's pointing out how ridiculous and arbitrary the worship of the American president is. Oh yeah. That's not presidential. Presidential means that you look dignified while you bomb a village in Yemen, like we should just destroy presidential. As an idea of adult said that he called it the uniquely American religion of President Worship President worship. Yeah. That is really. I mean it's really just a new version of King's. Oh, that's so funny that our whole foundation mythology is based on the rejection of the king and we immediately established king kingship, which is what they did in.

Speaker 2:          00:04:45       In Christianity. I think of Christianity this way, like it's based in this Judaic religion that says, let's get rid of the idea of a man that you worship or a figure or a God that you bow in front of them. There's one right in front of us, right? Let's get rid of a statue that you bow down in front of and the next religion was like, oh, let's watch a human being like, it's so weird that it's so in us. Well, it's Alpha male chimpanzee stuff. We always try to look to the number one though, the one that knows the most, the oldest with the most scars. It's gone to the battle as the most wisdom lead us because you want to know which snakes are poisonous and what plants you can eat and what's going to kill you. Right. And and, and everybody worships the past. That's what's so funny to me about an American. It's the day after July fourth and everybody talks about the founding fathers is like, those were dudes who had the education of it. There were brilliant people in the 18 hundreds and 17 hundreds, but I'm not like trying to. I'm not trying to go to a doctor from the founding fathers days. Yeah. People price dunk people probably did probably stank. It probably just would let people smelled like back then, like if you call it a gal after a bath, you were psyched.

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       Bath is that. Let's be honest about what a bath is. It's asshole and vagina soup. You're sitting in a big teapot, but you don't buy your balls in there. It's just the vessels in women put their vaginas in. Men they have. They hold up their assholes, their dicks and balls, so they don't concern me what a guy smells like, but what a girl smells like, concerns me, but maybe it wouldn't have back then. Maybe it wouldn't have. Yeah. Maybe just your standards change. I mean, if you're horny enough, you don't care. That is true. I'll never forget this passage always, but you're an incredibly horny person because my wife. Let me just say, guys, my wife is so horny. I love that word. How you did it in a sort of a gay. Why don't listen to funny that like being more mobile is gay is gay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:49       If you just start going like this, people go as gay as fuck. There's A. There's a story about Tom Cruise. We heard this, that he came to, I can't remember who it was, some comedy person who's like a normal human being, right? Like, but famous but not like Tom Cruise fairness. Right. Tom Cruise, like connected with that person. I can't make it a better story if I remember who it was. But if somebody like that, like your level or or, or, or like a mark duplass or. You know what I'm saying? Like I don't know who mark says, well he's the guy at your level. No, no, no. Is the duplass Jamie knows who everybody is. I don't know who the duplass brothers there. They made the show togetherness on Hbo. My point isn't about the duplass brothers is like, they were just like semi famous. Not like Tom Cruise cruise got so horny she wants to get to the fire.

Speaker 2:          00:07:40       So see he got invited to a superbowl party at this person's house. Right? Like imagine if Tom Cruise is coming to your house for the superbowl superbowl party. He was like, oh whoa. Asking Tom Cruise? And he says, yes honey. You said yes. What do we do? Right. And it might've been Tom cruise be like, I think I will be among the humans today. So Tom, because it barely shows up with a brand new, like clearly fresh football that his assistant like, you know, he's like tossing like a literal brand new football in the air. Right. And they're all talking about marriage at some point in the day and goes, do you know what the best part of being married is though? Right? Fucking your wife, am I right? You just fuck your wife. And everybody's like, felt like tumbleweeds are all three of like a robot, like an alien visiting us. He must be amazing to hang out with. I would love to hang out with him. Fucking your wife. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:08:31       I mean when you're that famous, your work ethic, it's like you just devote everything to that I think because like I have my, my agents were like, they know that the agents who are Tom Cruise agents, they said Tom Cruise always gets back within an hour when we send a script because I'll like keep a script for like three weeks. And then by the time I read it, the parts we can cast Tom Cruise, we'll read a script and an hour and get back to them and either like it or not it like he's

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       just like on the ball, he's, he's like, he's trying to win, he's won.

Speaker 4:          00:09:01       It's an inhuman instinct because our human instinct is to just atrophy in a way. I mean you have to kind of fight it, but easy to be lazy and to procrastinate.

Speaker 2:          00:09:12       It's definitely easy to be lazy, but it's not if you're going to be Tom cruise or really have to be on the ball, there's no other way. It doesn't just, he doesn't know time job. That's not just what's going on. And those, there's some weird alien sort of behavior patterns that we don't recognize as being normal. Like when he jumped up on Oprah's couch is like, I'm in love, I'm in love him and love. And everyone's like, what the fuck is going on here? Right Person? No, it's like a person who doesn't understand French, but you're speaking French to a French person who's saying all the right words, like, what the fuck is wrong with this guy? It seems like every choice he makes outside of acting is based on what he's assuming normal human beings think is the normal behavior because the love is when you jump on a couch and go, I love her.

Speaker 2:          00:09:52       Which is informed by movies really. Right. Like that's more movie like, right. That's like John Cusak and say anything like, oh, that's what love looks like. It's not, you know, or telling a bunch of the fellows, you know, oh, we're gonna have sex. Talk with the fellows. Also, I looked at my wife off the friction of her vagina. Makes me just sploosh alright guys. And everyone's like, we're sick of fucking r was never. I've, I've just done relate to that joke that you made. That's so sweet. Yeah. What a fucking strange guy. He might be one of the strangest guys of all time. I wish you would just come clean with like one day just to sit down and just be like, given some ecstasy and have them just talk about who he is. Like I don't even know the fuck I am and now I've been scientology for so long.

Speaker 2:          00:10:40       Like 13 guys last year was worried. They're going to tell. I'm always worried. They're going to tell you. He did Chris Hardwick's podcast, right? He did. He did a one on one interview. I listened to it recently. I wish you could get them on here because you, you, you get a, you get in. But I don't think you could pierce that impenetrable layer. I think he be fake with you to. Even if he's fake, you find out if he's fake to find some stuff. I will visit. You still appears. He was telling Chris like, I love movies. You know, I'm passionate about movies. And Chris Goes, oh yeah, like what are some of your favorite movies? This is how politically like constructed he is. He goes, yeah, just move a movies. All movies, all movies. So he quit. He was just no different. Biggest movie star couldn't pick three movies that have inspired because he didn't want them to like, you know, a Spielberg, a Bruckheimer and the blah blah blah, because then he piss off Coppola and Scorsese and you know, I mean, it's all a construct. God, I want to meet him. Yeah. I can't believe he did Chris's. That's so cool. You should have them on the show. You could get it. I think I got. I got faith. You could get it. I've had this guy on Ron miscavige who's David Miscavige is dad. Oh Wow. Who's

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       scientology? And I had Leah Remini on and we talked for three hours about how crazy her life and scientology was near a classic sp. There's no way you're getting a suppressive person. Oh No, I'm not. I'm just misunderstood.

Speaker 3:          00:12:08       I got to say though, that the more I learned about the Catholic faith and all these kid fuckers keep coming out, the more I'm like, that's the worst one.

Speaker 5:          00:12:16       Did you see the new one keepers don't know the new. There's a thousand cases of child molesting that they just uncovered. Shut down that religion. Catholic trump monsters. No, no, I'm not doing a pit, but all $8,000 it was connected to the church at Jamie will find it. It was just some. I mean I didn't even read it because I looked at the headline and the first thought was de and second thought was, Ugh, like you just can't.

Speaker 3:          00:12:43       I mean it's so much worse than like making some unbelieved they can get acting work like whatever scientology does. Like the Catholic religion is like their fucking little girls and boys and like permanently ruining their lives, making them have like terrible flashbacks, making them have like wide chunks of memory that they just don't remember. Then they do remember and it's like, it's just the worst thing you can do. And how do you like sexual problems? I'm not Catholic and Jewish now.

Speaker 5:          00:13:10       Well, you know the pope, the pope, ratzinger, that guy. One of the things that they do, one of the reasons why he stepped down was because they, they found out that he was one of the guys that used to move people around common. He was one of the guys. When someone get caught molesting children, he would move into a new new precinct

Speaker 6:          00:13:28       that, what do you call it? That's what takes your breath away. We live actually right next to a rehabilitation center, former rehabilitation center for wayward priests on our street

Speaker 3:          00:13:36       and I was like, oh. I always thought, oh, wayward praise. Like I wonder what that means. And then after we saw that movie spotlight, we looked it up and that's exactly where they were. Housing p one was one of the places they were housing the molesters

Speaker 6:          00:13:48       follow. It makes this really interesting point about the church, which is the commonly held sort of folk belief about the Catholic church is that when you take away someone's ability to have sex, you will. You will concentrate their sex drive and pervert it and you'll become a child molester. And what? Spotlight the movie sort of point that it makes us. It's the other way around. It's that that basically what you're a child molester, you go to the church because you know they'll, they'll give you a haven.

Speaker 3:          00:14:14       Don't feel cover for you. It's true though, like it is hard to become a priest. You have to like study scripture for. I mean, how long has he been here?

Speaker 6:          00:14:21       Did molest a child? You got to groom them, you got to hang out. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:14:25       But seriously know how true that.

Speaker 5:          00:14:27       So ratzinger moved to God that went onto molest 100 deaf kids. Yeah. I saw this documentary because they couldn't talk about it. There would be. Yeah, but no one's gonna listen to them. It's not like they can just start talking, you know what I mean? It's like it's a weight just. I mean he was working with deaf kids, deaf orphans. Well, it's just, it's not. Nobody would listen to a deaf person. It's it. This is how scams one step removed.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       Exactly. It's one more. What you want when you want as a Predator is, is the most vulnerable person that you can be predatory towards.

Speaker 3:          00:15:00       It's like a documentary keepers. It wasn't until this girl came to the priest and said, I actually have been molested. He was like, Oh, you have have you? And then he started molesting or waited for her to come into. It was a confession. Found that she was weak, she was weak. And then that's who we picked. So it's like,

Speaker 2:          00:15:18       why remember these Nigeria? Speaking of psychotic. It's insane. Yeah. But that's what they want. They, the molester. Lester loves the weak, the weak and vulnerable. Because if they go to a strong confident child who they know, what would it be like if you touch me, I'll tell my fucking dad molested. That girl's got a big mouth also. You do not touch her. I've seen your, your baby pictures. You want a hug.

Speaker 3:          00:15:42       Okay. And I was always trying to. Yeah. But it's very much always boys, right? Keepers. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's girls and boys. It's like who? I've only seen documentaries on boys, but the boys thing is weird, but I kind of. I do believe there's a math to like suppressing someone's sexuality and then it's just gonna come out in these other ways.

Speaker 2:          00:16:04       Well, I think that also monsters are orientation is spread equally across monsters. So oriented. Yeah. I think that. I don't even know. Are you gay? If you're a child molester, likes little boys, is that even gay? That seems like a third thing. Just you're, you're, you're not even in a sexual zone anymore. Now you're in a pathology zone.

Speaker 3:          00:16:23       But since the cases are so, there's so many cases, like maybe we should just let priests get married or something needs to change.

Speaker 5:          00:16:31       Well, they used to be able to, but they were rockstars. The problem was back in the days like the, during the Lutheran days when Martin Luther was around, priests controlled everything. I mean, they fucked everybody's wives. They, they, the pope. The pope had wives and children. Pope's had wives, they had children, they had money, they had armies. The Roman Catholic Pope controlled armies. They controlled troops. Like it was a totally different scene and then somewhere along the line they were fucking so many women that were like, Hey, here's the new role. You're going to be a priest. You can't fucking chicks. And then just the whole thing went, hey, does anybody know why that happened? Why the changeover happened? Because they were rock stars. Because there were banging everybody.

Speaker 2:          00:17:11       No Sir. Why they made them not raw. Okay. It, they were too irresponsible.

Speaker 5:          00:17:15       This is what I've read. What I've read is that there were, there was a real concern amongst people that were, you know, under the tutelage of these priests that these guys were out of control. They're just banging everybody

Speaker 3:          00:17:26       find out what was the reason why they made them not able to say, I wonder what you think that is.

Speaker 5:          00:17:34       It wasn't that long ago. Elaine was like a thousand years ago. It might've been less. That's so interesting. I think it was less than a thousand years ago because I know that during the [inaudible] con era, the pope still at armies and I think still, I think there were still allowed be married and have children

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       and they were using their religious status to abuse

Speaker 2:          00:17:54       their power and probably probably women would like fall for them too. There was no cigarette. If there's no musicians, there's no comedian who was going to go to the are going to go. The gestures are. They had comics back then. It was good with like a floppy hat. Yeah, but they were like cruise ship comics. They couldn't get out of line at all. They got killed. I still rock stars. They were just like had white hair and like, what's the deal with the latrine that you have to shift in? What is the deal with cornish game hen the white hair play the piano. That was later. That was like, yeah, this is like a dude plucking a lute. Right? I'd like to find out. Yeah, probably right. Your harp have a timeline. Is this idea that the guy, the itinerant singer that would come to talent and luck pluck the loot and tell like the tail was always fucking everybody everywhere went.

Speaker 3:          00:18:44       That's got to be who we, who. We all came from. It was like Robert Plant came from the gestures. Rock are versus comedian, right? We were the people who would come in on a wagon and juggling balls of manure. You know, like the king has the years of that. I would like to see you on the head with a baguette.

Speaker 2:          00:19:01       Do you think that you guys have like genetic ancestry to former comedians? Um,

Speaker 3:          00:19:06       I believe in that more than most of us. I believe. I don't believe, I just feel like I have a blood memory of like, like for example, I do think there are people in comedy who are doing it because that's where like the energy is right now and they're just like trying to like make money and. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:19:19       Yeah. Or whoever or. I think it's moved beyond that. It's like now it's like everybody that you would have been a dj when I was like 17 is now a comedian. Right? Is a lot of that. But I love you guys. Well, what I was going to. I don't really care. I mean I think you just have to like yourself. It doesn't bother me. I think it's cool because when you go big then the 10 percent of geniuses that wouldn't have started. If it wasn't cool. We'll start and then the 90 percent of people that we're going to be garbage. What do they. They don't matter. Damn Ninety 10, Huh? Fuck. Probably less. Probably 90 nine. One genius person that starts comedy. That to becoming like a forget genius person that starts comedy does a set at an open mic to becomes like one of the great comedians, like even in the top 10 percent of comedians that's, that's gotta be one percent. That's the point that time. But the problem with is like you say once they start, because the 99 point nine percent that start never even make it. That's part of it. Yeah. But like it's like the one percent that do the point one percent that actually become professional committees. Like how many people out of your group of open microbes that used to hang with, how many are still doing standup?

Speaker 3:          00:20:32       That ratio because how many of them have a TV show? All of them. Like it's easier to be famous now. So your ratios are a little off.

Speaker 2:          00:20:41       I remember when. Well yeah, no, the, the, the numbers are very start. I remember when I first started like I would have, I would have fucked a let a man fuck me 50 times to get like a Montreal spot and now it's like 50 times. I've thought about it a lot and they would, they would rub my back very gently and smuggling take me on like Alonzo Bowden. Okay. That he could do 25 times. Dude. I looked at Alonzo Bowden's fingers once and I was like, there are men with Dick smaller than your finger off for sure. Bottom line. Dick. Smaller than your finger. Oh yeah. Oh, well that's rough. If that's true. It's true. Anyway, Alonzo, if you're listening, every time I look at your hands, I think it was Dick's small ticks. Interesting. But my boy, Oh, I would've done anything for a Montreal spot or, or, or a spot on, on, on the tonight show.

Speaker 2:          00:21:32       And now there's young comics who like are like, Nah, I'm not really trying to like be a second lead on a show right now. I'm really waiting. Well from my vehicle it things have changed. I dated a girl that was like that. She was like, I don't want to do TV. I'm holding out for film because I was on a television show at the time and she was saying that she didn't want to do TV. It's like it was beneath her. Oh, and you're doing tv at the time. Was that news radio? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Great. So I'm a fan of that show.

Speaker 3:          00:21:58       I took an acting class with Paris Hilton and she and the teacher was like, who wants to do tv? And everyone raised their hand except her. And it was like, who wants to do just movies in Paris? Hilton,

Speaker 2:          00:22:08       right. It's terrific course once we legit. That's so fun. That was the thing in the nineties. Yeah. I guess know the Paris Hilton is one of the top highest paid djs in the world. She can't have good taste in music. Be a DJ. She's not a DJ. Also has like 20 perfumes and suck should go into deejaying. It seems like it's an open market. Dominate if you have half a sense of entertainment.

Speaker 3:          00:22:32       That guy's got a billboard on sunset. Most is like, he is like deejaying at a swimming pool in Las Vegas.

Speaker 2:          00:22:38       It was a huge famous celebrity Dj. You know how in La you'll always know what's happening in Vegas. Paul Harris or one of those guys, and it was literally you look down and it's like Vegas Swim Club, Dj in a pool, but those pools will have 15,000 people stuffed into the area going crazy. Horny dude. That's probably where I would hang out with one girl. She's going to go hang out. She's on her way. She's going, we're stopping there on the honeymoon tour where a Nixon mask and just go crazy and mix it with like a beautiful naked woman body with a Nixon mask on. I heard that they recently, this could be bullshit, started making more money on their nightclubs and on the. On the casinos. That's got to be true. It may be. I don't know. I don't know what the numbers are, but I would imagine they make a lot of money on the casinos. People like, what's up? I just heard John Taffer, that guy that does bar rescue talking about it on another interview, he said they'll go in on Friday night and make about 500,000 bucks for their clubs show and then wake up the next morning and do the pool at noon for 150. You don't know. You're talking about the actual performance. We're talking about the club itself. You're talking about the casino. The casino makes. But imagine that if the Dj mix $650,000 for a weekend, you got to multiply that by what? Twenty 100 percent.

Speaker 3:          00:23:59       Well, they may have the odd person like I am on that show dice about Andrew dice clay. Have you ever had him do this? Many times as you know? I mean I didn't know a real thing, but in the show, the whole premise is that he's paying off his gambling debt to the casino because it's like $800,000 and it's the only way you can pay it back. But that's a true story. He was in debt, like he would lose $800,000 in one night. So as long as they have people like that, they must be making a lot of money, right? Yeah. There's always gonna be. It was always like the old lady like putting in nickels but then there's also like dice,

Speaker 2:          00:24:32       but you also have to think like how much money does it cost to run a casino? The overhead is insane. Right. It's also, they also exist in this odd like venn diagram of like a legal business and an old world like criminal.

Speaker 3:          00:24:46       And I don't mean that in a Mafia. Like don't they have like India, like why is it even legal for them? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:24:51       For them to let someone rack up an $800,000 debt, like a normal business business would say, sir, you're $20 over your limit. So we're going to go. They just know, like he's got credit, he's nice, he's going to make money. He's gonna.

Speaker 3:          00:25:06       He gambled away the deed to his house at the Riviera and like they just lost my hip, hurt my Nana's wedding ring. And then someone told me when I was at, I was at foxwoods and they said because I was performing and they said that at Mohegan Sun, they're like, yeah, it's gotten really bad at Mohegan Sun when you gamble away your car, they won't even give you a ride home. But we at foxwoods or giving people rides like it's happening. Like people are just like, they run out of money and they're like, okay, I could win it all back if I just sell the car. And it's like they don't. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:25:39       Here's what's interesting though, if you, when they ban you, like my friend Dana, Dana white is a notorious gambler, but he wins millions of dollars sometimes. He's, I think he said he lost his much as $1,000,000 and he's won as much as 7 million in another. Holy Shit. Has He gotten banned from playing? Really? Yes. Dana. He's a celebrity. He only does he get banned, but he gets banned and then he pulls the UFC out of them. Like these two do ufc at the palms and he killed the palms and the palms bandom. So he's like, fuck you Ben, you and I moved to the hard rock or wherever the hell they moved in next. But yeah, they, they've banned him from a bunch of casinos because he's really good at blackjack. Wow. Can you. What stakes is what? What's the minimum bet for the Dana White blocks? I wish I knew. That sounds fucking crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:26:24       How is that legal? The band someone once they win at the thing you're saying? I'm saying

Speaker 2:          00:26:28       these casinos are not fully legal there. Like in this weird area. They reserve the right to ban new if you kicked their ass, which is crazy. Can they say you're card counting or something? Not Card County. I mean even if you are, it doesn't matter. It's legal. I mean you can do whatever the fuck you want I think. I think it's as long as it's

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       on your head, if you're not using a calculator or something that's technically within the rules of the game because your job is to sit down and I guess cow card counting. But blackjack. I mean you're supposed to not know. Like if you say, if you have knowledge, so we'll still ignore it and you know how to count cards. That's so stupid. It's like a girl going to a bar watching a guy roofie or drink up. Can't pay attention to that. Set the rules to know what the fucking rules are. Right? The rules are like if you know how many decks they're using and you know what you know when not to hit and just play it smart and count and thinking calculate. I know I also been a wiser retread. Why does Dana the root thing, we all accepted it sort of. It's your house.

Speaker 5:          00:27:26       We were like, ah, Joe, you got that? But I was like, hm, that's uh, why? Why does Dana white gamble or have no idea? The famous basketball player that like Charles Barkley, what drives those people? There were so rich. Why rules? What is also people that have been hit in the head a lot? Dana has been hitting the head a lot. I'm notoriously impulsive and notoriously susceptible to addiction. Whether it's gambling, addiction, alcoholic. Yeah. Yeah. It's a big part of cte, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which you see. I think I said it right. That's a brain damage from getting hit in the head. A big part of it, it was a lot of boxing when he was young, has been, has dome, rattled a gigabit time. Scott, that dome rattled here. You're not supposed to get punched in the head ever. Right. You definitely get punched in the head multiple times a day for years.

Speaker 5:          00:28:15       What about like you train right now I don't do any kickboxing sparring, you know, because of that. Yeah, and even in Jujitsu, you like slam into someone's knee accidentally or ahead. You get your head bonked your dome rabbit. It's not that common, but when I was kickboxing boy I got hit in the head a lot to the point where I just like. Sometimes I think about some of the decisions I've made. I'm like, what's going on in their life? What screws are loose? Even with headgear, you're saying you're still worse. Here's worse. Pickier. It actually makes an a, an artificial lever like save your head. Is this large? It means if you clip it here, it's gotten more of a fulcrum effect, whereas if your head is smaller and compact and you just take it here, so Richard Nixon mask would be bad because they had a big old chin knocking, knocking little bit the rubber in the mask, but the the idea is not necessarily just the initial impact, it's how much your head moves, like how might look.

Speaker 5:          00:29:08       The stronger your neck is, the less likely you already get brain damage. So these guys do a lot of neck exercises just just just to keep their head stable when it gets hit. The idea is like the more your head moves, the more your brain's going swish around inside your dome and and break off the connective tissue. That's also part of the problem is connective tissue. This like really soft, almost like cotton candy, like tissue that connects your brain to the skull. Which stuff gets ripped up. Would you rather be a nfl? Whatever the guy that linebacker thought it is a chore or a Longterm Prize Fighter, longterm prize fighter for sure. Longterm prize fighters can get through it. Like there's guys like Bernard Hopkins that fought into his fifties who speaks well, you know, and there's a. see the problem is even guys that speak well, there's the weird shit that they do, the impulsive stuff. There's like if you talk to people that are cte experts, they tell you some really disturbing things about brain damage, about how it manifests itself in the weird things that men find themselves doing. They don't even know why they're doing it. They're just doing it and like real impulsive behavior and just stomping on the gas on the highway and just like weird gambling stuff and sex stuff and drug stuff. And a lot of it is connected to cte. What have you looked over at? Hofstra was crying,

Speaker 4:          00:30:23       looking at me.

Speaker 3:          00:30:28       So watching MMA, like where they're like doing 69 and just arriving, arriving. You're like, one's got the head and in his dick and then the other one's got his stick and they just kinda like ride back and forth.

Speaker 4:          00:30:43       And then just like one of the main commentator say, right, he's got, oh, he's got his head in his dick and they're rising photons that have said things along those lines. See, I listened

Speaker 3:          00:30:56       sport. You have to understand from a woman who's not into sports and then sees that

Speaker 4:          00:31:02       it's, it's, it's like I don't understand it. She comes in and she says, always did derisively did your team win? I'm like, there are no teams. I mean I'm just there barefoot. Like they maybe have been fucking game. That's the video. The video game lets you get a little gay or than the actual shoot. Actually, that's a good one. You can actually fuck it was a great game.

Speaker 5:          00:31:32       Could be no, it looks like a dude that's a. that's a dude a triangle.

Speaker 3:          00:31:36       So it's people who don't. They don't care about brain damage though. Like this sport, this sport brings. What is that funny? I don't you think that's important. They don't care about the cartilage that connects their head

Speaker 5:          00:31:47       cartilages are the connective tissue, connective tissue. It's not that. It's not that they don't care, it's just that this is something that they started doing when they were young. They got really good at it and they see it as a path to make career and they like thrills. They like doing things dangerous and excitements and exciting. Some of them just accept the risks and some of them say, I would rather live a dangerous life. That's exciting than a really fucking boring. Like sitting on the couch atrophying.

Speaker 3:          00:32:15       I can respect that. I mean, I. of course

Speaker 4:          00:32:18       that's funny though. This is like, was like going to like on Davinci's podcasts and being like, I don't know about this art stuff. I don't know about business

Speaker 3:          00:32:26       can take it. I think you're right. No, you're right. My perspective is when I see it, but I now. Now you put it like that too. It's like what? What's the alternative? Get A, get a job in a factory or get a job, you die.

Speaker 5:          00:32:39       This is temporary. This

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       is not going to last. Right? So for them it's like, how am I going to use my meat vehicle? Yeah. And am I going to use it for fun? Just go crazy. And I mean that's a, that's the thought process behind it is like, yeah, I know I'm doing damage to it. And I, you know, I know a lot of guys that have known when they were in their prime where they were just killing everybody and now they are broken. That's it. I know guys who can't even brush their teeth, their shoulders are so shot. They have to like brush their teeth lefthanded and they suck at it and the crazy fucking move their head. And how old are they in their thirties? Yeah. There is something about the human animal that wants. It's an interesting facet of humanity that wants to achieve greatness for some reason.

Speaker 5:          00:33:21       I will see the glory of winning in that too is also directly related to the danger of doing it. It's like there's something dangerous about it that makes it super exciting. If you pull it off, it's winning. A fight is, it's a crazy feeling

Speaker 4:          00:33:37       more than making all these other people happy too because people have voted on, you know, or how do you do it? You vote on them or whatever. Like you bet on them. I mean it's like you're, it's so many people just. I've noticed so many people get their mood is changed if their team wins. So it's like

Speaker 2:          00:33:54       the problem with mma though I read when Chuck Liddell started losing is when I realized like MMA is not a good sport for like having to have your guy when eventually your guy will always lose always because they'll get older. That's just the inevitable reality. Exactly. The team dynamics, your team can always be a winner, but if you root for one fight or that federal get old and the young people will come in and it's like 38. That's way old. Thirty eight is whale, so like 32 or something.

Speaker 5:          00:34:26       Especially now with drug testing, it used to be back in the day that when you would get tested, it was really like they would say it's like an intelligence test. It's more than a drug test, like just don't take anything the remaining few days before your test and they just testing your pee for like really obvious stuff, but now it's super comprehensive and they use Usada, US anti-doping association and they, they fucking crawl up your ass with a microscope. People wake you up checking for what people want. Yes. They are in the room. Will look at your Dick because guys are used rubber dam.

Speaker 2:          00:35:01       Yeah. I went to Rehab when I was a kid so I know I knew all the tricks to wizard eaters or you'd get your homie to piss into a bag and you'd have the bag in your pocket.

Speaker 4:          00:35:09       What kind of drugs are mma? People doing? Steroids. Steroids. Oh right. It's not like I know nothing about it. Like, well that to make sense. Legal. So they're all doing it. Why would they do it if it's illegal? Joe? I got to say your impression of Natasha. Okay. No roles. Did you illegal drugs or. No, now I'm horny. Okay, hold on. I just thought that people had a, you know, and that they wouldn't do that. But you're saying they would all do it?

Speaker 2:          00:35:41       No, not all. There is definitely a core group of champions who have never thought about taking drugs and still don't have a problem with steroids. There's a lot to do. Promo. Sarah is also. Is that when one person starts doing it, the person beneath him either will lose or has to be pressured to do it and so it creates this like,

Speaker 4:          00:35:59       and sorry if people out there are upset that I'm not a sports fan, I'm don't think about them. Let's just talk. Do you believe that's what's holding us back? Don't sweat it. You do though? I don't. I mean I'm just like, sports are holding us back. Is that what you mean? Thinks he's doing a what's elevating us? That's holding us back. What's the elevator making sports like? Our main thing I hate when sports are on in any sort of public establishment. I think it's aesthetically okay. I want to tell yourself it's okay. You don't like when you see sports in an establishment. I find it depressing, depressing, but what about law and order when you watched that? That's like one notch down, but very depressing. CSI. Pull the head off the carpet to the head.

Speaker 2:          00:36:47       For our Natasha I will say is a. is extremely connected to aesthetics more than any human being I've ever met.

Speaker 4:          00:36:56       I think tennis is a nice aesthetic. There you go. Okay. I would. I was told that's a sport. I know. It's okay. I think like a tennis match. Yeah, I could handle that. Why is that okay. And like honestly because I like how they like how they dress. What about basketball? No, no, I hate those long stories. No, I don't like baseball or darkness to play tennis. Yeah, just a couple of chicks are really good at it. I mean I think it's probably because I grew up and I was always the last to get picked for sports, so maybe that's why it was so totally want to go deep

Speaker 2:          00:37:34       when I hug you. I'm always worried I'm going to break you. You, you weighed like 80 pounds.

Speaker 4:          00:37:37       I wish you a hundred and five.

Speaker 2:          00:37:40       Come on. You do not weigh 100 pounds. You Line Yourself. Do you do.

Speaker 4:          00:37:45       I mean, I'm not like that skinny. I'm just

Speaker 2:          00:37:47       small. She weighs 105 while we fuck and it's 101. We're not fucking I a five pound debt. I mean I didn't. I didn't want to mention that. I asked the test and I had to bring it up, but it needs to be said. Yeah. I've got an Alonzo Bowden to have lots of document for Alonzo and fingers. You about the sport? No, you don't have to. Excuse me. I don't like sports. I also don't like video games. The only thing I watch is fighting. I literally don't watch sport. I don't. I don't even know the rules. Like you don't like any sport other than MMA and boxing. I don't watch them. I don't. I don't even know when they're happening. Like when someone says, oh, just see the NBA championship game. Like Oh, when was it? No, it was last night, man. You didn't watch. I'm the same as the thing. The only sport I watched his MMA and have watched consistently since I was a kid, his mma and then boxing very secondarily and that I can't get into kickboxing at all. Really?

Speaker 6:          00:38:36       Laurie? I've seen clips of everything. I don't know why I can't. I can't get into because I like him and made much more than boxing. But then you would think I would be more in the kickboxing and boxing, but I'm not.

Speaker 4:          00:38:45       Sports just seems like men exercising. That's funny. But like I just, I mean I know it's more than that, but like if you saw opera, you'd probably be like, this just seems like fat people screaming or screened opera. Do you like it? No, I felt like it was just like antiquated form of entertainment that I watch. I was super duper high when I went to see you because I knew, I knew I had to see. It was like, oh, just I had to do a favor. So, uh, when I, when I went to watch, I was like, listen, I'm just kidding. Bullies out of my fucking mind. But what's interesting is I, what I really started paying attention to was all the people in the audience and there's like this class of people that probably live in Bel Air and Beverly Hills and want to be seen at the opera and it's like a big deal to say they're going to the opera and I was watching this, it was like they can't possibly like this, like even if they like it, they don't like it, that they don't like it. Like people like the UFC. That's true. That's true. You're right. 100 percent. What he's saying is pretending to like there's a different level to what the light.

Speaker 6:          00:39:49       It's not true. It's like sophisticated entertainment. I mean like we went to the, to the orchestra, the symphony recently. And I hated it. I've been, I went to the symphony when I was a kid with my grandma. She used to take me and there are some bangers, you know? Yeah. You know like Dun Dun, a Banger, the, you know, that he was just in there like doing this thing. But we went to see, I don't even. Who Was it? Mahler and you read the description, Mahler and it's like laminations on death, not a discord and not pleasant to listen to. So we're going to go sit down for an hour and a half. Performance of like something that in its description is like Natasha. You didn't like it either, did you?

Speaker 4:          00:40:27       No, and there was like a low. Moshe got in a fight with two different elderly people. He tried to help this woman. I was walking in like double crutches. It's so old you can't

Speaker 6:          00:40:38       imagine. It's like it's so old and so white. It's like unbelievable. You can't believe it, you know? And I was walking in and this old man was a sitting down and he's like 85, and so I told him he started to get up to let me throw it go, you don't need to get up. I can kind of crawl around you. And he goes, we're not all as young as you. Some of us are gonna die soon. And I was like, Oh, I'm trying to go. I just read the wikipedia page. I go like, oh, well I guess that's what we're here to listen to. Right, and the guys, nothing iced me out and I sit there like bored and the worst and it's got. It's the worst kind of symphony Mahler because it always seems like it's ending it be like, Duh, Dun Dun Dun, and you're like, cool, let's get the fuck out of it. Done.

Speaker 4:          00:41:23       Never got the old lady who yelled at you and she almost fell down the stairs. Then as

Speaker 6:          00:41:26       we were leaving, I was an old man and he was so feeble and and wobbly that I was staring at his body like in my mind, you ever have this kind of situation where you're like this, this is going to, this person's going to fall. I can feel it in my bones were way before it happened in the steepest possible. It would and I could feel it like if this guy's gonna fall, he's too feeble. He's too old to be ascending the stairs and he sure enough does. He just starts to tip over and he goes for it because I was already like looking at him. I grabbed him by like the, the, the, the top, the collar and the bottom of his jacket and I just held him up, right? Oh my God. And he fucking like, just like shoved me off of him, gave me a dirty look and stormed off.

Speaker 6:          00:42:10       And I was like, I just saved your fucking life. You all bitch wanted to go. Maybe you want way to go. Listen to them all. I listened to Mahler out depressing shit, pretends he slips. Listen to his wife complaining about her stool. I saw blood in my stool and he's like, I'm just going to fall. You know my grandma Gloria. So to good, steep angle, my grandma said to me what he said to me on her deathbed, like days before she died, she looked at me and she said, if there is a god, he saves a worst part of your life for the very end. It's like, bye bye grandma.

Speaker 3:          00:42:45       Thinking about that, because I was like going into a like an old person's home seems so depressing. Like I would never want to do that to go away from your, your stuff in your house. You know, like, I'm just trying to think what's the best way to go. I think it will be

Speaker 5:          00:42:58       themselves in a home will alone when they're super depressing too, right? Yeah. Yeah. I lived in New York when I first moved there. I stayed with my grandparents in New Jersey and my grandmother had had an aneurysm. They gave her 72 hours to live. She lived 12 years. Wow. Yeah, Dude. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:43:15       It was over those 12 years.

Speaker 5:          00:43:17       I was only there living with them for a few months. I think I lived there for maybe five months, six months, but it was bad. It was bad. Like my grandfather, they had a nun or a non. A nurse would come over and they would help, but this like she would have horrible bedsores. She couldn't move. She was paralyzed. She was completely vegetables. She would talk a little bit on your teeth were falling out. They had all fallen out. She want to live at that point. No,

Speaker 3:          00:43:43       no, no, but I do think like the two ways, the two main ways to die or like to have a death bed, like that seems kind of glamorous because then you could like call people to you and give them wisdom and like have last words. No, but if, if you die in an accident, then you never get to have any of that. No. You can't have those funny last year

Speaker 6:          00:43:59       or the third way. What is the, what is you, you're a bit about your grandma and her deathbed. I don't remember the third. The third way though is to go mad and to shit your pants. And two, my grandmother didn't die like that though. That's just the job. My grandma did. My grandma's great fear. Her entire life was becoming a feeble senile person that was to herself and of course it came true because the only way to avoid that is to have a heart attack or an accident.

Speaker 3:          00:44:23       I feel bad that I say that about my Nana. It was just a dumb joke.

Speaker 5:          00:44:26       Well, you know, they have assisted death now in California and 11 people did it on the day. That's crazy. Please. My absolutely did in the first day, which I absolutely believe in. I mean I think God damn it. Why do we need to have people die of natural causes when they're horribly suffering? And that's a good question, right? It's like what is suffering? If you are physically fine, you have a 70 beats per minute resting heart rate. You have no cancer but you just five pounds everyday, five pounds deck every day. Hating life.

Speaker 6:          00:44:57       Yeah. It's crazy. In Scandinavia where they've had euthanasia for a long time, they started to accept that the person who suffering from chronic depression can opt out and take assisted suicide as a means to escape their depression.

Speaker 5:          00:45:12       Isn't a part of the problem with pro, with chronic depression, like we don't know what they're feeling. Like if you. If like someone, if you have a broken arm, like, okay, I broke my arm, I kinda get it, but if someone says I have chronic depression, I was like, okay, what does it feel like? I don't know. I don't know what your depression is and in your chronic depression might be different than another person and another person. It's like, how do you know that it can't be turned around with a pill or with exercise and diet, and if you did turn it around like I have friends that were suicidal and now they're super happy. So it's hard.

Speaker 3:          00:45:42       Well, the problem is the main one of the main tenants of depression is hopelessness. So if you can't feel at all hopeful, how are you ever going to try to get your way out?

Speaker 6:          00:45:52       Another strange thing about mental illness in my experience, and I have a lot of it in my family, uh, and is that it always looks, not always but it off, except for schizophrenia and stuff. Looks obviously like that person's sick and can't help it. But with depression or alcoholism, that kind of thing. It always feels like you could act differently if you just tried a little bit harder. You could not be doing this. You could be less depressed. You could go apply for a job, you could get up a look at the front. He has schizophrenia. You can see as impossible, but it looks to the normal brain like close enough to normal that they could just change your circumstance if only they tried harder and mental illness is maybe the inability to try harder, so it's very seductive to the normal brain to think of mentally ill people is like lazy or not trying to get better.

Speaker 5:          00:46:39       Yeah. I just think it's one of those very odd things to quantify of almost impossible. Like I don't know what you're feeling, you know, and what is like what's normal for some people, you know, and like some people are just ecstatic all the time and like what, what is normal for them.

Speaker 6:          00:46:57       And also the antidepressants are like literally just a chemical experiment with somebody's brain, go tinkle this and do this.

Speaker 3:          00:47:04       Yeah. I know people who ever since they started taking antidepressants, it's changed their life and their lifestyle better.

Speaker 6:          00:47:10       Sure. Have you ever taken either of you ever taken an antidepressant? No. Someone gave me some adderall once. That's not similar bid on entity. I was on it when I was a kid when I was a 13, 12 year old media personality. Changing, I remember my brain doing things to me that I didn't like physically. Like I started to see things in the horizon of my vision. I started diff. My, I started to feel like less hungry. I started to like see things in the horizon of your vision, you know, like actual apparitions, not apparitions, like, uh, like sort of like sort of hallucinogenic fractal situations, you know, I started to see that and it just like I could feel it tinkering with my brain. I of course, what was happening was I was getting given antidepressants to combat, like being a juvenile delinquent, like Druggie, and so it wasn't treated. It wasn't treating thing that existed. So a psychiatrist gave you this? Yeah, I was all fucked up with psychiatrists that is will give you, that's the real problem, right? They'll give it to people that don't need it.

Speaker 3:          00:48:07       That's what's happening with the opiod crisis. Like they'll, people just like, they'll just give you oxycontin. Like it just seems so crazy.

Speaker 6:          00:48:14       It was crazy. This doctor told me this weekend, I was talking to a family member that's a doctor that it takes eight days of, of a regimen of, of what's the drug in the, in the car. There's one drug that the, all the opiate addicts are getting addicted to Oxycontin. It's not oxycontin, fentanyl, fentanyl. It takes me for dead eight days to get hooked and a and a treatment regiment is something like 12 days. So it's like everybody that's given the treatment regimen for regular pain is, is having to kick it when they get off. And that's why. That's why we've got a crisis that is incredible. That eight days in you're hooked. It's insane

Speaker 5:          00:48:53       because everybody who takes, if you break your leg or something, they give you fentanyl. No. Um, I don't know why they give it to you. Medical marijuana for a broken leg for pain is real simple. I mean, you're saying it like you haven't thought it through like that because they make a lot more money selling you something you can't get anywhere else. Too naive.

Speaker 3:          00:49:11       It's not like the first rule of being a doctor. We're not going to hurt

Speaker 5:          00:49:15       relationships with pharmaceutical companies. I mean, so it's a standard appointment believe that people are like that, but there's also a bunch of doctors that are ignorant to the actual positive benefits of pot. They have a negative association about pot. People don't smoke pot, but also to get real. Like if you have a compound fracture, you don't. What you need is more than medical marijuana at least at first. You don't agree with me. Oh, you would take your phone. Is your bones sticking out of your leg and your parts. You pop it back in and what you. What would you take? Only once you get the cast on it, you're fine. It just, she just sit there. It sucks when you move, but you don't have to take that stuff. You don't have medical marijuana. Supposedly they did a recent test and 93 percent of people with chronic pain preferred marijuana over opiates.

Speaker 3:          00:49:58       God, I can. My mom has pain and like she's never tried drugs and I just can't get her to try. You know, like there's such a stigma, like she'd probably try phentenol before because a doctor, a doctor said it was okay. Then marijuana. I wish we could change the.

Speaker 5:          00:50:14       We are not a fan of pain pills. I hear you reconstructed and I didn't take anything. I just. I'm like, I'm not taking them. We took marijuana though. Or Smoking Pot luck.

Speaker 6:          00:50:25       How much did you suffer? It's not that

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       bad. It's just paint. Depends on your.

Speaker 5:          00:50:31       Yeah. That's the kind of pain that you just go, okay, well that's what that feels like. Okay, now I know what that is. Back pain is one of the harder ones. Like everything you do, that's a very overrated pain by the way. It's nothing. It's like scratches. It feels like. I know I've heard people say it hurt more than anything in their life, so your people are pussies, doesn't it? Doesn't hurt them. It just doesn't hurt that much. It really just does. It just absolutely does not hurt that much. There's spots where it's not comfortable like bones, like elbow bone when they go over the elbow bone and oddly enough, like right when they get close to your chest, that's painful, but not childbirth. There's fucking manageable. You just go, whoa. It was like just. I think a lot of it is just how you think about the course and the fester.

Speaker 2:          00:51:16       What's the most painful? Does anyone know what the most painful thing of human being can experiences? What's like? The top threshold seems to be a compound fracture is as bad as it gets, but maybe I'm told I just seems awful. Broken. Broken bones suck and broken. A compound fractures is a broken bone and in a horrible laceration. Oh, right. I guess that's true. I have a broken arm and it wasn't that bad, but burning. I think you're right. Burning burning is one of the most absolutely painful ones. Burning, not burning to death. I think that that's rough, that recovery process from. Do you know that when burn victims are in the hospital, other burn victims, random strangers go to them and talk to them. Wow. I didn't know that. My friend Zack is that craiger who's from the widest kid, you know, and he's a successful actor. He's on that show, wrecked. Uh, he told me he burned himself at a party in the Caribbean and in the Caribbean people would go visit, burn victims from the Caribbean would go visit him because apparently the pain is so intense and insane that they

Speaker 5:          00:52:19       interesting. Let me say this now before I forget. Um, people who love Steve. Oh, Steve. Oh, did something. I don't know what the fuck he did, but on his instagram, if you're going to denver this weekend, Steve, I was going to be in Denver. He has horrible burns all over his body and he's looking for some sort of an emt to take care of him, like someone to help him dress his wounds because he's still going to do his shows at the comedy works and apparently it's going to. You won't tell the story of what happened to him, but he put it because he wants to tell it onstage, but he put these images will put a video of it up on instagram and his fucking skin is falling off of his arm. Really bad. Yeah, it looks really bad. Don't do your show, Dude. Want to say to Steve, have you listen to this? There's a new stem cell therapy that they've created for people that have burns where they spray stem cells all over the burn and the healing time is radically reduced as well as the scarring. The scarring is radically reduced. So another thing we tend to look into that

Speaker 2:          00:53:20       they put tilapia skin on the burner you heard about this low fish scales on apparently is one of the much so much more healing than bandages. I don't know why, but it like creates this sort of, you know, skin on skin healing and it did apparently the doctors trying

Speaker 5:          00:53:37       prostitutes burn victims using fish skin. That's fascinating. I'm going to be okay. He's going to be okay. But he's gotta go to the Steevo instagram page so you could see it. But this stem cell treatment is pretty radical. Like they've shown people with third degree burns. They sprayed on them and in a couple of days it's gone. That's crazy. Yeah. Like literally no scar. No nothing. It just heals. That's interesting. Yeah. I mean it's, we're, we're in a new world. Uh, not this. And the next one. The next one. Did you take it off?

Speaker 2:          00:54:07       What about that one? Oh, that man, he took it down. That's a video of him getting blood poured on his face.

Speaker 5:          00:54:12       Took it down. Whoa. That's crazy. He was asking for people to come and see him in Denver, like all that stuff all over his body. All those. Like he showed what that looked like. Click on that because it just seems like. Yeah, fuck. This is one video that he had. This is not going to show anything, but the next video he showed what's going on under those bands

Speaker 2:          00:54:38       and it's horrific. Oh, maybe it got flagged. What's, what's the most painful thing you've ever experienced?

Speaker 5:          00:54:44       I don't know. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:54:47       I feel like I'm so lucky. What about you? You got nothing. Your shoulder? I'm a baby. Her shoulder popped out in Hawaii and it was painful though. It was. I just don't like getting blood drawn. I felt very weak as a man at that moment. She popped out of the ocean and her shoulder was like separated body surfing and I was just like, you did you get an Mri? Do you know what's going on? Oh yeah. It was like three years ago. It was a dislocated. Yeah, right. But no tearing or anything like that. I apparently, it doesn't feel the same. Dislocated my shoulder. I didn't even know weird because I could see it physically on her body. She doesn't have as much muscle as you, but I was looking at her arm going like, I don't know what to do about that. I don't know what I'm going to do. I guess I could hoist her on my shoulder and walk back because it was like there was a wall. It just popped back

Speaker 5:          00:55:32       posted. Like for some people you're supposed to like lay them down and stretch their arm or pull it out and then it'll fall back. In.

Speaker 2:          00:55:39       The most I know about shoulder dislocations is from lethal weapon, so slam them up against the wall. Do they throw it into yourself? Just have loose shoulders. Like I know some girls who like every time she has sex or like one out of five times her shoulder becomes dislocate. I'll be honest, Joe touched on some of the loosest shoulders in the game. Maybe those girls are just like drama queens. No, no. Always going like this and they just like being hurt. Whether fucking. Can you imagine though how bad that would be if you were fucking the girl and her shoulder got dislocated? Yeah. That was really bad or good or some pads. Solar pads. Some shoulders, some football town support. Yeah. I do that anyway just because I like a more masculine woman, so I liked her to be wearing big back something with a

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       just like give her a little Tbi. Traumatic booty injury, jail. It's so easy to go to jail now. Yeah. We should be in jail just for saying this right now so we can. Aren't you glad to not be dating right now? Oh yeah. It seems like a nightmare for everybody to know. That is. It seems so scary. If you get lucky and find someone that's awesome. It's great. It's a good time and it's fun and exciting. But most of the time, well, you know, I remember, you know like now it's like if, if, if a girl wants to, she can just say that she didn't consent and you'd probably make them fun forms, fill out forms, but you didn't need forums. I think she'd have a stack of them next to the bed just to let chicks. No, that's. This is like really casual. Like they do that though. All these so many forms. All these big stars do that. They make you like instagram cruise.

Speaker 6:          00:57:16       Not like the beat, there was a story about Justin Bieber will make you like videotape yourself saying like, I'm of sound mind and body and I choose to fuck Justin Bieber,

Speaker 4:          00:57:23       you know, oh, that makes sense, or whatever, because he's fucking little skanks allegedly and uh, you know, they're probably trying to get over on them. And I would imagine if you're that wealthy, like you have to worry about everything you do all the time. I'm sure there are a lot of guys who are probably trying to take advantage of girls, so for sure. Maybe there's more of that. Maybe that's on the rise. So it's bad for you. Boy. I bet it's the same as it's always been. There's always been creeps in. There's always been creeps on both sides. This is the thing is that there, there's more creeps in the men's side. Let's get real. I mean there's more like there's more

Speaker 6:          00:57:59       psychos, maybe more crazy people that you date, but there's more predators that you as there are more male predators than there are female. I'm sure there are female partners and their cycle men, but if we were to really do some number crunching,

Speaker 4:          00:58:13       you know, I would imagine it's not even.

Speaker 6:          00:58:15       I've never had, it's 50 slash 50. I've never had an experience that I was actively scared and I've had experience where I was like, I'm not spending the night at this girl's house because I don't know if I'd wake up

Speaker 4:          00:58:25       our friend. This girl emailed him and we left. Well, I'm just saying there's two real. I remember this one girl, I was at her house

Speaker 6:          00:58:33       and I was like, oh, I, this person maybe would kill me in my sleep. She was, uh, she was crazy. She was, I remember she kept, she was like real Hollywood, like punk trash right when I moved to town. You okay with this story?

Speaker 4:          00:58:46       And uh, she, she, she

Speaker 6:          00:58:49       kept going. She kept asking me to put a cigarette out on her and I was like, I don't think I can do that and I don't think I can do that, but I would like an ash on her.

Speaker 4:          00:59:04       We're like full put.

Speaker 6:          00:59:06       And then I remembered that she was, um, she was, she kept when she was, she would go down on me and she kept like horribly but biting me and my genitals and she was like biting my balls, I remember and I was like, please stop that. Like please, please know. And then all of a sudden we kept

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       making out and she looked down and she looked. She was like, what is that like a, the way you say, uh, what is that when somebody is got like an std, right? You know, that like, what, what is this? And I looked down and there was a fucking contusion in my nuts, like a hiding it from her bite. She like burst a blood vessel and there's like a mad about it. She wouldn't know she had and she had done it and not, you'll have a little respect for my wife's in the room. So she's sucking my balls. So Hi friend emailed him,

Speaker 3:          00:59:59       said, just so you know, I know he didn't have sex, but if we had permission and it would have been

Speaker 2:          01:00:04       right, right. She goes, what does our friend who was her friend was at at Reed College actually were or not. Were you? Yeah, so read a read. Not Evergreen, but read where it's like the center of like the woke sort of PCC campus culture and she extreme. That's very extreme. She called him and said she was drunk and she came onto him and was like, his name is Andrew [inaudible]. He's a, he's A. Oh, I shouldn't say that. Oh, maybe I shouldn't say that because I just blatantly telling him he didn't do anything. No, no. He d, She came onto him. Let's not say her name now. I don't know who she is, but he's a comedian and I just figured he'd want a shout out, but at any rate, he's a great comedian. He, he definitely avoided the punchline. So at any rate, he, he didn't hook up with her. She came onto him and he was like, okay, I'm not feeling this. No, thank you. Went home, went to bed, a gay guy. And uh, and then she, she texted him like a week later was like, I just wanted to thank you for not taking me home that night because I was drunk. It wouldn't have been consensual. It would've been raped. So thank you. It's just like, well, that's how a lot of people want to firmly established that though, that if you're an adult and you're drinking and you have sex, it's rape.

Speaker 3:          01:01:15       Well, it is hard though because you have to understand being a woman, you are so vulnerable. Like men have more upper body strength. We do have a whole. And they have a thing that goes into the whole.

Speaker 2:          01:01:23       Whoa, you're saying crazy things right now that no one knows. No, but it's like we drop that kind of knowledge. You have to

Speaker 3:          01:01:30       yourself. Imagine yourself if you had a whole instead and you didn't have those muscles and you were just walking around, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:01:35       well, what is the idea that women or men are afraid that women are going to laugh at them? Women are afraid men are going to kill them. Yeah. Those are both very different things. Yeah. But that's the reality is that just like when you say there's like the equal dispensation of predators on the side, it's like, well no, there really aren't. Right. That really is. I said there's creeps in both sides. Don't necessarily think it was equal. What I mean is, and I'm not trying to. I wasn't doing that to like I said that, but I did probably was flippant. But my point is that, that the world that women walk around in is one where they fear that the worst case scenario is they're going to be kidnapped, raped, and murdered. In our worst case scenario is usually is not that. Yeah. Well exactly the rate part in particular. Most of the time it's not that. And if it is, it's also from a fucking

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       man from a dude. Yeah. I mean I, I had an argument with a guy who's a men's rights activist about that. He was like, actually more men are raped and women are stupid. They're raped by men. Fuck. You're just reinforcing the argument against men. That's like such a dumb argument. Well, they always like, they haven't even looked into it. They like, they like, it's such a surface thing to say like, have you done like the next step? Like who's raping? Oh yeah, guys probably shouldn't bring it up. Yeah, you should probably shouldn't bring it up. Do you want her to support men? If you like. Your whole thing is that men are awesome. Like men are actually. The victims were raped more than women. Right. By what? Goblins. Let's fucking. Demons are coming

Speaker 3:          01:02:56       middle of the night and raping you. That's a good point by other men.

Speaker 5:          01:03:00       But this guy was saying it like, I got you with this fact that I bet you did know

Speaker 6:          01:03:05       well, because people like to talk and talking points. They don't like to. I mean

Speaker 3:          01:03:08       a lot of experience with the alt right people on your show. What's that? Just that they don't think things through. Like remember that guy was trying to tell you that the people at the woman's march, he's like, how did they take off their, their work and it's like it was on a Saturday, right?

Speaker 6:          01:03:22       Did we have this guy on the show? That was like, the problem is it was all out of work. People that just, I don't know about. This was a talking point in the right about the women's marches or just about protests in general. I don't know how these people are able to have such privileged that they can just take work off to go protest. It's like, first of all, there's a history of protest where people strike. That's the whole idea. But second of all, the women's march in particular was on a Saturday, so it was this guy who is this guy named kid named Lucian wind trich.

Speaker 5:          01:03:48       Now you were asking who is? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:03:52       Good. All right. Brian, this reason I came to you because we were trying to get a. basically we did the show right? And we started with cultural appropriation. We ended with the outright with meet the outright. Right. And so we were trying really hard to really explore ideas. Right. And I guess if there's, if there's one thing I realized in the, in the wake of, uh, we definitely triggered the outright with that cultural appropriation thing. People were very upset that we even broached the topic without condemning it essentially, and I think there's. There's one thing I realized in the wake of all of the show is like, there's one position I truly don't respect. It's, I disagree with you, therefore I won't listen to you. Fuck you. That's, that's really. There's nothing about that that I have any respect for.

Speaker 5:          01:04:35       No, I completely agree. I think I want to know how you came to that conclusion and oftentimes you could find if you. I mean especially if you particularly disagree with something someone says and you thought your side through and you talk to someone with an open mind, you can actually find like the holes in their logic and it'll help you understand. Maybe you got some holes in your own logic,

Speaker 3:          01:04:56       not aware of them. Exactly. Experiences they're drawing from to help come up with their way of thinking. Right? Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:05:01       and I definitely exploring all those topics found just what you're saying. I found like the part of the gun argument that I really fully wrapped my brain and my heart around the, the pro gun second amendment right. I mean, I'm still not like a wildly pro gun guy, but I totally 100 percent this understanding of where they were coming from that I never had before. That really, you know, a lot of the condemnation of the left is that they condemn identity politics. Right? And really when it comes to second amendment, stuff it. And also the truth is the outright to. It's also identity politics is just identity politics and the reverse. It's not like left this identity politics, it's more gun owner identity. Like in other words, when you condemn a gun owner, you're, you, the liberal thinker is going, oh, I'm condemning guns, I'm condemning violence. And what you don't understand is you're condemning a person with their hearing is you're calling them their identity. They're the thing that makes them passionate, a illegitimate stupid, and based in ignorance and violence. And of course a person's going to react and go, go fuck yourself. I'll never listened to your argument. If you start your argument by basically telling them their whole lifestyle is bullshit.

Speaker 5:          01:06:08       Yeah, there's a real problem with the gun ownership argument and one of the big problems is the mass shootings, right? Everybody condemns mass shootings. They're horrible. They're terrifying, and they only happen with most of the time people with guns. I mean we've had some situations recently in Europe where people driving over people with cars and there's a lot of insane shit that's going on over there with that and then people had been stabbing people in some places, but for the most part it's guns. Right? But my thought on it is always that it's a mental health issue. There are more guns in this country than there are people. So if you have 300 million guns and every once a year or so one of these things happens and you have this mass shooting this horrible tragedy. One of the most constant things, his mental illness, almost all those people are either on psycho psychoactive medicine.

Speaker 5:          01:06:55       Either they're on some sort of anti psychotic or an antidepressant or the coming off of it. They have a history of psychiatric treatment, a history of, of illness, of mental illness. It's 100 percent. It's almost 100 percent of people that are like severely mentally ill. We have horrible standards for mental illness in this country for people just being roaming around the street and a lot of that came from Reagan when Reagan let those people. Yes. When they let those people loose, that means people need fucking treatment. They need help. It's a lot of them. So a lot of people that are on dissociatives, they're on all these anti psychotic medication. They're fucked up man. Like they real issues and then they can get ahold of guns.

Speaker 6:          01:07:34       I agree with you, but I also think there's a flaw in that logic because the mass shootings didn't start commensurate with the shutting down of the mental health facilities in California. When did they. I, they, they seem to me to be a more. I mean, Kent State obviously was the original.

Speaker 5:          01:07:50       No, Kent State was the National Guard.

Speaker 6:          01:07:53       I'm sorry, what was the loan in the tower in Austin, Texas in 10 states in Ohio. Excuse me. Yeah. That, that was like the first, uh, the first big one. But the modern phenomenon of the mass shooting is, it is a fairly modern one. It feels like the last 20, 10, 20 years,

Speaker 5:          01:08:07       right. You know that that guy in the tower was mentally ill.

Speaker 6:          01:08:10       Oh, I'm not disagreeing with you at all. That there's. That mental illness is a huge part of the pie.

Speaker 5:          01:08:15       You're saying the Reagan thing. I'm not saying the Reagan thing is, is that 100 percent the reason for it, but it's a big part of why there are so many mentally ill people that were released in that time. I mean, I can remember when I was a kid because my dad was talking about it, he was like, it's crazy. There's like so many more homeless people now. That's someone and they're talking to themselves. They're all fucked up. We just abandon these human beings because their brains aren't working.

Speaker 6:          01:08:34       Right. The idea, the idea was that Reagan shut down all the mental health facilities in California and the idea was that they would be replaced by community centers where each community, each neighborhood would have like a check and send out the check and centers of course were never built, so the people just hit the streets.

Speaker 5:          01:08:50       Fornia was. I thought it was when Reagan was president. I go, it'd be changed the standards. National, national.

Speaker 6:          01:08:55       I could be wrong nationally, right? I could be wrong. It was when he was president. I might be wrong. I saw dark man made the check in. They just didn't exist. I mean, what was the only thing I was saying though was that it's. There's something else happening in America that's like almost feels mystical or spiritual with it when it comes to mass shootings because it's like there are other countries with mentally ill people that have access to guns. That and maybe it's that we, that we have a less, a lesser standard of care for mentally ill, but cal Canada also has people babbling on the streets. Although they have limited access to guns. There's something else going on, it feels like to me, and that this is totally anecdotal and just my opinion, but feels like to me there's some thing that we don't understand that it is of course mental in this entity that is of course access to guns and there's some third thing that people don't really can't put your finger on, which is like, why is this happening here? Why is it happening so much here?

Speaker 5:          01:09:47       Well, it could be related to overpopulation. He could be related to the sort of established mindset of the American people. Like why are Canadian so much nicer when they're connected to us? Like you just like if you look at the landmass, there's no real line, but you go across the culturally. Yeah, they're, they're way nicer. They're just nicer, you know, and they're, they talk like us, they look like us, they pronounce a few words differently and they're way nicer, you know, and they don't get a lot of mass shootings up there at super uncommon.

Speaker 6:          01:10:17       It's interesting. I mean it's based on this. I think it's about the connection of America to its guns is based on. It's, it's, it's a foundation mythology. It's religion in a weird way, right? The religion of America, the greatest country on earth.

Speaker 5:          01:10:30       Well, it's based. It's a lot of. It's based on fear means it's freedom for sure, but a lot of like the tactical people, like the people that are really, really into what happens if somebody breaks in and you've got to be ready to go up, pulled that gun out on two point two seconds, got to be able to Tink, tink, tink, shoot targets. I mean there's people that I know people are good friends that practice that shit all the time and if you break into their house you are fucked because they're ready and they're looking for it. They want people to break. I know people were asking people police break into my phone.

Speaker 6:          01:10:59       I took Natasha to shoot guns in anticipation of this gun episode that we did with the it so much I can't say I love to do.

Speaker 3:          01:11:06       I will. I got there and I thought I'd make a joke because you have to pick your little target. So I was like, are there any trump?

Speaker 2:          01:11:12       I'm nudging her, like Natasha, we are not in the right area.

Speaker 3:          01:11:17       We got the Hillary's coming in next week.

Speaker 2:          01:11:19       Oh, real hillary. That you could shoot me. I think he was just talking shit to her for asking the trucks. Yeah, probably talk with a southern accent. It was a side of twice

Speaker 3:          01:11:33       and then we get in there and there's people just like doing magazine rifles. And then there's a guy going through saying, uh, what was he saying? Like, no rapid fire, rapid fire because they're just like, just like these kids. It was pretty crazy, like there weren't even dividers in between us. Oh. And then he was telling me how to work the gun and I was like, he's like, make sure that your thumb doesn't go here. Okay, go ahead. And I was like, wait, wait. Where is my thumb? Not supposed to go, can I, will you please? Because I know he didn't know motion had no either way. Go Laugh and pointed me. Motherfucker was this little little poof over here. Scared too. We did a one. I didn't know I did the. We did what we had got like 50 rounds.

Speaker 2:          01:12:12       Yeah, we bought, we bought two cars. You have to buy the ammunition in like a box you can't buy like all have. So we bought two boxes thinking we'd be there for awhile. The training, the training session was literally 10 seconds. Thirty seconds on. Put your hand here, put that there. Okay. Here's your gun. Go shoot. And people are rapid firing and you're surrounded by other people that got that same safety briefing. Right? Right. And, and there's a celebrity wall, one celebrity Shiela booth, right. This is not what you want to see. That's a weird one too, right? That's what I'm saying. I lied about being there. It was a picture of him there. So I shot the gun and she shot it and then I shot it again and I'm feeling like I gotta get Outta here. Natasha was like, I got to get it.

Speaker 2:          01:12:54       I just think it was a bad. I think every gun advocate or strong gun person we've talked to since said about that particular place, like that's not a place to start. It's not a cool place to unsafe and so we just, so I think we picked the wrong place. At any rate though, I'm thinking about these two boxes of ammunition. I'm like, I can't go to the dude upfront because he'll think I'm like a little bitch, you know what I mean? Like, I got all this ammo left, you know what I mean? So, and then she's like, Natasha, she's like, don't be an idiot. Let's get outta here. So that's how I walk up to the front and I swear I sold her out immediately. I'm just like, you know, I'm trying. I love it here. You know, this is my home baby. I like how you go black with southern.

Speaker 2:          01:13:37       If you want to do an idiot, you go black. The guy. I'm like, I'm like the wife, you know what I mean? The wife is like, let's get outta here. You know, women, I want to stay, I want to stay, but I can't. I got to admit I'm not clicking on say the wife, the wife is, you know, I'm all like emotional from having shot a gun. Like I gotta get Outta here, but really I'm just like, you know, as you well know you want to shoot all night, but the live now I'm going Italian. First time I ever shot one. The first thing I felt when I went into the, the area where put the ear plugs

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       on and you stand next to these people and there was these little dividers, the place that I went. But when you hear that you feel so vulnerable. Yeah. You feel like, whoa. Like if that hits you, that's a wrap. They not going to make it. Yeah, exactly. I got to ask you guys this before you take off. Just see this trump thing, the CNN thing, they're going after the kid who made the meme heard it wasn't a kid. Well this is the thing. Jamille explained the whole thing, but it was a kid that they went after who had made a video or made a meme, but apparently the meme came from a video and the video was made by someone else other than this kid and they essentially. They threatened to docs this kid, they. They said they reserve the right to expose him and I already 15. I don't know if that's been 100 percent proven.

Speaker 6:          01:15:01       I don't know if it's been 100 percent disproven, but I just heard that that is a lie. It's a lie. The 15 year old

Speaker 5:          01:15:07       ness of this kid, well I don't know if that's the case because he's not actually 15. It's because now they're talking about a different person who created the original video that was turned into you. Video, Gif file,

Speaker 6:          01:15:18       trump body slamming the.

Speaker 3:          01:15:20       No, they're saying that. That's

Speaker 5:          01:15:22       so trump. This is what it is. Trump was on the wwe and he did a thing where he slammed to the ground and so they're gonna. They took that and put a truck, a CNN head over the person's body who trumps slammed to the ground and then trump tweeted it

Speaker 6:          01:15:36       offensive. Very inappropriate. Very non-presidential. Pretty fucking funny. I mean I got

Speaker 5:          01:15:42       nothing compared to him talking about that woman having plastic surgery and saying that her face was bleeding badly from the face lift. That's just gross. Like that is something wrong with him. That's so beneath anybody. That's not, that's not just beneath the president that's beneath

Speaker 6:          01:16:00       it is something deeply wrong with him. He's getting worse. He's going off these, these on tissue right now. Pressure probably getting mentally ill at this point because the seventies isn't. Isn't mental illness like your brain chemistry changing and can you imagine what would. By the way, when the outright came after me for for the show, I had this other realization which is even people you don't respect if enough people hate you, it. It's, it's gotta affect on your brain and imagine being Donald Trump where half of the world or more is like, fuck you all day every day. Half the world. Imagine a large number of people in the Republican America. Exactly,

Speaker 5:          01:16:41       but it's way more than half of America now because there's a large number of people in the Republican Party that are criticizing. Right. It

Speaker 3:          01:16:47       makes me mad, is that we called it the women's March and that no one really gives it respect for what it was because it was the largest protest protest in the, in our history of our lives was to an anti, basically an anti trump protest. Like when that guy was elected and like we should just be talking about that more like that's never happened in our lifetimes or our parents' lifetimes did it. There was that big of a. because someone was being elected and it just kinda gets pushed to the side. I mean, I'm glad it's called the women's march, but it's just like

Speaker 6:          01:17:17       basically that we. The idea of it was marginalized in the scope of those marginalized because they called themselves a woman

Speaker 3:          01:17:22       smart maybe. I don't know because it's such a huge deal. Like I mean it was so exciting to be a part of that and you saw those pictures and they weren't just in every city in America. They were in every city in the world. That's how opposed we were. That didn't happen. When you know anyone who in our life

Speaker 5:          01:17:37       times, it's become kind of a reaction to a president before. Never wanted to talk about the CNN. What's crazy is that CNN is becoming a monster to fight a monster. Right, and they're threatening to dox people that are making funny memes. I all that was was funny. I mean nobody really thought that Donald Trump was actually slamming the person that is CNN that doesn't even have a head that has a cnn for head and feeling. Some reporter from CNN was going after the person. They track the person down on Reddit who made the means. Who gives a fuck? Who made the memes? That's what's crazy.

Speaker 6:          01:18:10       Meme itself isn't offensive. The name itself is funny. The offensive part, if anything, is that the president of the United States thought it was appropriate to retweet it.

Speaker 5:          01:18:18       It's more dumb than it is. If it did offend me even slightly, I saw him that he retweeted. I was like, Huh, that's my reaction.

Speaker 6:          01:18:24       Listen, you are correct in my opinion that the CNN in particular and the press in general is as filled with warts, not as filled with warts, but it's filled with warts in the same way that the funding

Speaker 5:          01:18:38       found Dick joke to make joe that was the right joke to make the right time didn't mean it and you're there at the top there. We would have such a laugh over this. We've got to sand them off before I see the Mrs Farmer, but it's not that. It's this new realm that we're in where these cable networks are struggling so hard to get attention and they're focusing on really crazy shit. Like CNN had a bunch of people fired for making up fake stories about Russia and trump or not substantiating these stories and making sure they're correct before they released it and put it live and so three people had to resign. I think it was three CNNS not struggling. That's what they're struggling. They're down 20 percent and rating.

Speaker 6:          01:19:26       I thought CNN and MSNBC and some other left leaning thing, although I don't really consider CNN left leaning is like at the top of the charts now

Speaker 5:          01:19:37       what I read, and it might be bullshit, I don't know. Well, let's pull this up. See if you could find out. What I read was that CNN is down 20 percent since June, and that Fox is actually up 20 percent.

Speaker 6:          01:19:48       No, no. So lots of splits like typed and CNN ratings. It says chump is way off on cns ratings being down and trump said, no, no, no, I didn't. I didn't hear it from trump. I heard it from someone else was probably parroting trump. I mean, we're all that there in lies the problem. We're all being wrapped filled with misinformation from both sides. Each side is so

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       in their, in their echo chamber, but they all accept the left and the right included all except the information that they're getting as Gospel truth that cannot be assailed by the other side's facts. And so nobody even knows what the truth is anymore. Nobody knows what the argument. Even if they read it, it's true. Oh, so Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, so trump is responsible for everybody paying attention now driven by surgeons. For the Rachel maddow show. Last word with Lawrence O'donnell. I have no idea who that is. MSNBC is up a whopping 86 percent in local view. Total viewers. Wow. In Primetime. That's amazing. You Watch. Do you watch Rachel Maddow? No, she. I think she's great. I think she's based. She's just so good.

Speaker 4:          01:20:46       Incredibly smart. Tucker Carlson is a well dressed guy with a great haircut,

Speaker 2:          01:20:51       good vibe. So you know where he is though, but he is. Is like this odd bridge between reasonable people in right wing maniacs. Yep.

Speaker 4:          01:20:58       He looked good. He's a bridge between reasonable people.

Speaker 2:          01:21:01       Sure. Compared to Hannity. Sean Hannity. So much more reasonable than, than just a dick though. That's the problem. He's an. He's an asshole to the people he interviews. His whole thing is that he bombards them with like kind of snide interviewing, that relentless, snide interviewing until they make a mistake, deserve it. Like he brings up several posture is people just for. Because he knows that they're going to say something stupid. Deacon mark. Exactly. Well, there's this idea called not picking in Natasha.

Speaker 4:          01:21:28       I'll take an uber and you can stay. Well I. that's totally fine. I just. Weird little moment. Your relationship. Sorry. I had the whole day like just by the hour, you know, and I have to be in Hollywood. It's, it's for. I get it. It's something I'm doing like I'm, it's a voiceover, but we could, we could bring this whole Tom Cruise. Whoa. It's not Tom Cruise and scientology promo film. I'm sorry. It's just I have like partners who are waiting for me and if I don't get their writeup for wait a minute for boring explained. It's an adr session that I'm hosting a table from my show, another period and it's in Hollywood at four, so I have to go. I'm sorry. No worries. I had a great time. I had a great time as well. I think we learned a lot about each other

Speaker 2:          01:22:16       for things. You guys have an awesome tour. It's going to take off. Tell everybody. July 19th, we will be in New Orleans, Louisiana. My Dad always says the uninsured. Then we're going to Atlanta, Miami, Montreal, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, yeah. We'll be in Brooklyn. Moshe Kasher.com. The [inaudible] dot com. We'd love to.

Speaker 4:          01:22:37       He does a set. Sometimes we switch the order and then at the end we both come out and we'd been giving people love advice, live relationship counseling. It's been really fun and we've helped some marriages I feel like if you haven't, but do you see. It's a funny thing to say right there. Maybe

Speaker 2:          01:22:57       if you. Did he give them a microphone and they asked questions to you? What would they come up on stage? We basically they have. Some of them have one time.

Speaker 6:          01:23:06       We've helped some people in the most minor ways. Like somebody like the cat likes to sleep on the on the bed and we go, well, why don't you once a week put a blanket down, let the cat slate. One guy was like, well, I think we have problems because I wasn't touched by my parents at any point until I was nine years old and we were like,

Speaker 4:          01:23:25       not qualified. Say I would love to stay here and talk all day, or at least for another hour listening. We can do it another solo podcast after we leave for another 45 minutes will be fine. There's plenty of entertainment out there for these folks. Oh, you want me to stay? Whatever you want, but I got to call the uber now. Then we can wrap it up. I think you should take whatever you want. So we'll wrap this up. Let's wrap this up. Ladies and gentlemen. Have you ever had a more awkward ending to a podcast? It was perfect. I love it. Awkward. It wasn't awkward at all. She's angry.

Speaker 4:          01:23:59       Conversation in the car. You guys should. You should do like, this is going to be a good stream. You can tell a lot about a man, how he does an impression of women, I mean accurate, mimic, and then dice always make them like, no. He's like, can I please? And then other guys always make them seem like gay. Like, Oh, where's Tasha? I'm not making fun of all women. I'm just making fun of you. Oh my God. My impression of women yourself. I hate sports. My impression of women goes like this. Hi, I'm Alonzo Bowden, exercise size with three fingers. All Right, ladies and gentlemen, we wrap this up by. Thank you guys. Thank you for having a pleasure. Thank you.
