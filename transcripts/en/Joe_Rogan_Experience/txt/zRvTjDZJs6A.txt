Right to the fucking way I should weigh in first cause I have a feeling that, okay, don't be a pussy. Don't be scared. Okay folks, Jesus. Oh by the way, we did the height tests, uh, because Ari Shaffir, who was supposed to pay if they got a low two 27, are you supposed to pay for their trip? The loser has to shave their beard and the loser has to pay for the winners trip of their choice IX. Unless they can get down to two 27. And which Arusha fear agreed that he was going to pay. But now our is bogging and he's saying that they have to be, uh, their, their height has to be measured because the body mass index would indicate that they have to be a certain height or they're obese.

Speaker 1:          04:56          It was really weird. So we, we tested the heights. Okay. Um, uh, Tom is just under six feet tall and for all you assholes at Sam five foot two, we tested me too.
