Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Oh

Speaker 2:          00:00:04       yes, we live Tommy buttons. Let's do it. Dude. Did you, um, did you go to the comedy store at all yesterday? Yesterday? No, I'm going tonight is heavy, heavy, heavy. Yeah. I imagine it would have it the day after Mitzi died. The clothes, the comedy store down on Wednesday and yesterday was the first day it was open. It was heavy. Imagine this the first time it's been closed in a law. Like they never close. I can't remember the last time it was closed. It was heavy. You could just feel it in the air. Oh yeah. Yeah. I felt it was everybody talking about it, but it was bombing to really. Not on my show wasn't too bad, but the o man, it was thick. Know boy is in the air, you know, that's real sadness. Oh yeah. Paul was. I've never seen he cry. He was there.

Speaker 2:          00:00:52       Yeah. He was crying in the onstage. No, he didn't go on stage. She's not going to go on stage for a while. I wouldn't have gone onstage if I wasn't getting ready for the special. I would have definitely taken the night off. Yeah, if I could have, you know, if it wasn't early, if people aren't, are going to see it, it just felt I didn't feel silly, you know what I mean? I like to feel silly, feel loose, loose in a good mood, happy. Everybody felt vulnerable. Everybody felt, you know, I mean, I don't know all the people in the world that are not comedians. She's into the number one most important figure in all of comedy. That wasn't a comedian. And then even when you say the ones that were comedians, damn, she's in the running for number one. Even with the comedians. I know

Speaker 3:          00:01:41       she shaped so many, you know, she built that whole, that place and, and, and she, she, you know, they call her godmother, but it really was like that because she advised so many people. And actually here's the thing, a lot of people have advice for you, but she was giving good advice to people. I mean, look how many people hire. Hold her in that regard. Yeah. You know, legendary people are like, she's it man. Universally. Yeah. Yeah. There's no one going. Mitzi shore ain't shit. No, nobody says that unless you didn't pass you. Yeah. Like me, I met her once and she was like, no thanks. But what year was this? 2,000. Six or seven. Oh yeah, I remember. Well, here's the thing, when I met her, she was um, she was already like, it was at the end of when she would be at the store. She was, she was not 100 percent doing well. No, she was rough around then when you would see her, she'd be shaking. It would be very hard.

Speaker 2:          00:02:36       Yeah. I just, you know, when someone's gone, you stop and think about those times when you were around them. You just like, I wish I took it in and realize more that she wasn't. She wasn't going to be there one day, you know? Did you guys have a good relationship? Yeah, we did. I mean, up until the seven years that I wasn't there. And even then it was never her fault. I called her the date. That whole Mensa thing broke out. I called her up and told her everything. I told her the guy's been stealing material and the whole deal. And every comedian feels so uncomfortable working around them that they flashed a light whenever he's in the room so that no one does their material. And you just start working the crowd. I go, it's a fucking war zone there. It's terrible. And her exact words.

Speaker 2:          00:03:20       Well, while Jess Day away from, um, what time you want to go up tonight knows it. Yeah. And I, I said, and whenever you want to put me up, she gave me a spot. And then the comedy store called me an hour, two hours later, whatever it was. Instead I was banned. And that's how I go. What the fuck are you talking about? I just got off the phone with Mitzi. She gave me a 10:00 spot. They're like, well, Muzzi wasn't aware of everything that was happening. I got the fuck she wasn't. I told her, I told her everything. I go, who's running the store now? You, you run running the store and the fuck Outta here. I'm not working for you. And you guys are going to ban me because I added a joke. Thief like this is you guys sell art. You gotta a thief of art that's in your midst.

Speaker 2:          00:04:03       You did you understand that? What a big deal that is, someone is making millions of dollars of stealing other people's ideas and you guys are just going to let it go because he sells tickets. The Fuck Outta here, but my cora was never with her. I was with the other guys. Did you guys speak after that happened to? He never spoke to her again. Wow. Wow. I said, yeah, well by the time I came back she was real rough, real rough. You know, she had other things to worry about. Of course. I just had one. I had that one showcase. Those. My only direct experience with her when I met her in 1994. She gave me a lot of good advice. She did. She. She always gave me good spots, like hard fucking spots, always after dice after Martin Lawrence after if anybody would crush, I'd gone after him after Chris Rock, after this guy, after that guy anyway that would crush she.

Speaker 2:          00:04:57       She liked you. She would give you the. The deaths spots really well, which you realized that you have to. You gotta eat shit, man. You got to develop. You can't just have. It's like there's an analogy with fighting like you can't just fight people that you could beat the shit out of. You have to fight people that are going to test you. Sure, because otherwise you're going to develop like a, an unrealistic sense of your abilities and an unrealistic sense of other people's abilities and you have to. You have to. You have to feel what it's like. I think as an up and comic comic, like you start thinking you're pretty good and then you have to see someone who's really good and then you go, oh my God, I'm terrible. Yeah, and then you go on after them and that feeling of just total ineptitude or you just feel so shitty and clunky and awful. You have to feel that too. Just it's. That's the number one motive, like bombing is one of the best things that can happen to a comedian. That feeling of following someone great is basically. It almost feels like shame,

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       shame, shame. Like someone goes, Hey, do you want to feel humiliated? Like it's fucking shame, man. Yeah, I see it all the time too. I watched it the other day at the Improv. I watched somebody bomb. They went on after somebody's crushed and they just would just choking like right away and you just go, woof. You got to reexamine. Yeah, but it's a gift. It really is. It helps you in those moments are gifts. Those moments of failure are gifts. They just feel like shit at the time, but you got to realize that that like every like leap that I've made in my act in or in my, you know, my, my career as a comedian has come from a humiliation, like you hit that humiliation, they go fuck. Then he come back strong in that. That's what everything else to totally. Because as long as you actually think about it and try to address it.

Speaker 4:          00:06:47       Yeah, because it is a, it's devastating. It's only not helpful if you go, well, I'm just not going to even put any thought into that experience at all guys do do that. Of course they did lock it out, block it out, block everything out, and they never go anywhere and they're still doing the same 15. Yeah. Yeah. It's a defense mechanism. You get just get scared and you can sort of just autopilot your way through some half ass bullshit. Meanwhile you're about to go. Do you have a weak man one week from today, son? I'm ready. I'm excited that I'm doing it in a cycle around when you're doing it, you know, like you just did yours and then you know, there's a couple other guys. Joe Is getting ready to do one. Everybody's Kinda getting ready to. Joey lined up for one. She always got something cooking.

Speaker 4:          00:07:36       We're trying to figure out what's happened and either he's going to do something with Netflix or I'm going to direct it and then if, if Netflix doesn't do anything with them, I'm just going to find out something and that's enough. Just we're going to take over the ice house for three days. That's just fucking go bananas. Just let him go. He's on fire right now. Yeah. He lost a ton of weight now. I haven't seen him and I'm like, I don't know, a month ago or so last night I was like, Holy Shit Dude. He's like, I'm down 30 pounds. So when Shit, you could tell he's. It's weightwatchers taking my vitamins. Counting points. Yeah. Those eggs. Zero points for Exxon. He only eats the yoke.

Speaker 4:          00:08:14       He cuts. So you see them cut the egg white out. You're like, oh yeah, egg whites. He's like, throws it off the plate. He's like, yolks. Wait, everybody eats the egg. White was like, that's for pussies jokes. They don't do that anymore. You know that egg white thing is bullshit. They realized that most of the protein and. Well, the whole idea was about. It's just, it's hard to shake off old ideas when it comes to nutrition and the old idea was that dietary cholesterol is bad for you, but it's not right. Dietary cholesterol is actually good for you. It sounds crazy to hear it. And also, by the way, I mean, I know this sounds like a real simpleton thing to say, but how do they get this shit wrong for so long?

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       You know? Good. It's a good question. All we here for years and years is this is doctors are telling you to do this and then it feels like one day like, oh, we got all that shit wrong. What? You can use someone like Chris crusher or Dr Rhonda Patrick, or like Robb Wolf, like real nutrition experts that really understand the way nutrients like the way your body absorbs them and what's what's necessary, what's not necessary. What they're finding out is that first of all, there was, you know about the whole thing where the sugar industry paid off scientist to say that saturated fat was the cause of heart disease. No, he didn't know about that. Oh my God. I was in the New York Times. It was crazy. In 19 fifties. Sugar Industry paid off scientists to take the blame away from sugar and put it on saturated fat. I know the sugar lobby is insanity and that that's the only thing we haven't seen on the percentages of, of daily value is the percentage of that sugar you're supposed to have.

Speaker 2:          00:09:57       Yeah. In other words, when you see like, you know, presenting. Yeah. And then what percentage of and then sugar, it'll be like 52 grams percentage nonexistent. So yeah, they fucked everybody up because they got everybody thinking that it was saturated fat. That was a problem. And it's really a refined carbohydrates, bread, pasta. Your body converts that into sugar and then sugar itself. So there was that, there was, you know that. And then there's also, there's a reality of refined carbohydrates mixed with saturated fat. It's not a good combination. When you mix the two of them together, it is not good for you. Especially for some people, you know, different people's body bodies absorb it differently. But when you're on a high fat, low carb diet, it's very important that you, that's how you do it. You can cut that out. You don't want to go high fat and refined carbohydrates and sugars as well.

Speaker 2:          00:10:50       It's not good for you. And that that is like a. So there's a mechanism to it that Dr Rhonda Patrick explained. But essentially it's just terrible for you. Yeah. If I have, I have high fat and if I go one week just not even go crazy. But just like, yeah, I'll have bread with this and like that, like in three days I'll weigh eight pounds more. It's crazy and I just go, I can't do that. It's crazy how the weight just piles on you. Yeah. It's bananas. Speaking to wait bird specialist also coming out. Speaking a way. Yeah, it's coming out. I think. What does it have to do with weight? I was just saying births fast. I was just kidding. I was just associating words, attitude that. But I think it's considered a Hashtag. Hashtag Bert is enormous. Uh, it's great. I love that. He's also shirtless in this one. He took his shirt off and special. Well, at least you'd be able to see the background being different. It's true. He's so crazy. Um, but yeah, that was coming out. Netflix this summer I think. Does he just always take your shirt off now? I don't know. I think on, I think when it's a big,

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       like a. If he's doing his weekend, it's big shows. Yes. What is that? I think he's doing spots. He doesn't necessarily do it. What is it,

Speaker 2:          00:12:00       Jamie? Just put up the pool. What is wrong with your microphone? Yeah. Fix that son. He uh oh. Oh my goodness. He's swimming. Yeah. Okay. We're watching them swim. Why are you showing us this champion? Just to fuck is wrong with you. Jamie just follows everything burt does. He does? Yeah. He's a disciple. He's a machinist. He's. Oh, that's a. They called them that. Fix your mic pro. You're a. you're an audio engineer. Fix your mic. That was fucked up yesterday too. You might need a new mic. I got some backup links I can drive over. Yeah. I mean your mom's house right down the street. Right down the street about now. Try it. Nothing. I don't hear God damn nothing.

Speaker 3:          00:12:46       Oh. Hey. There's still a little crackly. No. Yeah, I think it's actually a fader. Yeah, there's something wrong with that. Oh Shit. Jesus. The problems. So we were talking before the show about you doing a whole new hour now. How long did it take you to concoct a whole new hour? Well, I mean it's definitely still building, you know, it's new, it's new. And I, and I know, I'm like, I know it's 15 away from being something where I'm like, oh, this is a solid, you know, 70 minute show, which is what, how I liked to do a theater, so it's going to be months still, but it's, I did an hour at the tabernacle last week of, of uh, it's all new and I did 10 that I didn't, that I did before that I didn't put it in my special. So it's like, that's mine to manipulate.

Speaker 3:          00:13:32       Nice. I mean, it was, I've been working on it for I guess since December. No, you know, like, around then December, January. Yeah. So four months, five months. Um, it was a blast. That was one of the most. It was so much fun because I had so much anxiety going into it. Oh yeah. Because it was the first big show of new. I've been doing some club weekends and you know, clubs are just different. They're just different and you can get away with more, you can get away with more and you're more exposed in a big room. Oh yeah. So I was like, I mean, the night before I was like, what if none of this works like that, that kind of feeling, or I was like, what am I doing? And uh, you know, I woke up early that morning and I was just like, Nah, it'll be all right now.

Speaker 3:          00:14:14       You got to be fun now. It's going to be fucking terrible. Like I was going, I was going back and forth like that on that show, but it ended up being just utter chaos. I mean, they were just, they were all about it. So it was really fun. I mean I just, it was, it was so much more fun because I had that feeling of uncertainty of course. So that's one of the cool things about doing a special is that like you, you get so introspective, you examine every bid with a microscope, you go over it with a fine tooth comb for like weeks before you shoot. Yeah. You start second guessing everything. And then that week of, and that, you know, on the last one I did in Denver, I did a show Wednesday and Thursday I did Oakland. And then Friday I came into Denver, I did a midnight show at the works downtown and every show is different and you're like, this is terrible. But then you know, and then you have those two tapings. And I think every. This. I did my, that was my third, uh, I think our one and you know, I think almost all three. The first taping is over and you're like this good. That's fine. We could use it. And then every time. The second one is just

Speaker 2:          00:15:34       loops. Yeah. Yeah. Once you get it into camp, that's why I decided to do for. That's smart. Yeah. Because I feel like you do four and then one of them's going to be like a real show. True. Yeah. And the thought, what I've found out, what I've found out though is if I have for the first one, turns out to be a real show because you're not as. Not as under as much pressure. Right? Because if you have to, you have two barrels, like you get the one done and then you, you feel like, oh, I got it now. It can be loose for the second one, but if you have four, you feel like, Eh, let's see what happens with this one. And you could at least that's how San Francisco was when I did. Um, uh, the fillmore. That's a good spy. That's great spot. But it's a high ceiling. I'm really excited about the Wilbert. Wilbert is kind of a high ceiling too. But the, Wilbur, I liked the wilburn. Each place has a low ceiling was three stacks of people and then like you have a high ceiling and there's a high ceiling and Bong amongst the, a above the front people in the very front row. But it's basically the three, 300 seat comedy clubs stacked on top of each other. That's what it's like. Such a great room. Fucking amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:16:42       I think I'm, I'm, I'm looking. I mean, you know, my, my next one will be a while from now, but I've already started talking about with my guy about how I, you know, even though on the tour I'll do some big rooms, I go, I think I want to go to like a 1200 seater that to actually shoot it. Yeah, I think those, those are in my experience as of recent, that thousand to 1500 seat venue is the most fun show. It's like where it's big enough where there's crazy energy, but it's small enough. You still kind of connect with the audience.

Speaker 2:          00:17:11       Well, sometimes those big shows that are crazy fun too. Like I did 6,000 seats in, in um, Dallas. Fuck yeah. Me and Tony and Ian were pulling up and this is a big fucking traffic jam or like, God damn, we're all these people going. And then we realized, Holy Shit, they're going to the show coming to see me. That's crazy. It was very bizarre.

Speaker 3:          00:17:32       Yeah. That place was hyped up. That was a lot of fun. I did this one theater last year and that was a 3000 seater. Which one is Toronto? Oh yeah, I've done that. That's great. That was a great, great. Like for like a pretty big size. Great Energy. She ever do. Massey Hall? No, I never did hall.

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       Some of these places you get to work at. It's like they're like museums. Yeah. Well the Tabernacle is. Yeah, I mean that we're talking about. I go. Can you imagine if the Baptist ministers that used to give sermons heard what I was saying on their stage and I like how upset they are. Those guys. That's what. That was a baptist church. Yeah. I mean it doesn't have an Oregon behind her, so they still have. The pipes are still there. Yeah. Wow. Over 100 year old church. It's fucking amazing venue. Yeah, it really is. Yeah. We're super lucky. We get to work these places. I did the king's theater in Brooklyn last weekend I was at. Oh amazing. That's old, right? All this fuck from the 19 hundreds, early 19 hundreds. And then it closed down from like 77 to 2005. And then in 2005 they started renovating it.

Speaker 4:          00:18:38       It's a long time, that close, long time it was just sitting there and then they, they took forever to renovate it and then they reopened it in 2015, 2010. They restarted it somewhere. Oh my God. Dude. I'm telling you, you walk around the place and it's just lavish. How many seats is debt? $3,000. Oh my God. It's gorgeous, man. That's in Brooklyn and it's in Brooklyn. Brooklyn, Brooklyn. Well, gorgeous. Stunning. Like the inside of it is amazing. Not totally designed for comedy. Yeah. You know what's normally there were kind of like, I dunno bands probably. I'm sure some comedy. I think, uh, think Chris rock did it. I think some people do comedy there, but it's, you know, I think they've only been doing shows there since 2015. So what it says. Hmm. Yeah. This is their calendar. Yeah. Yeah. There's Jamie's boys. How do you say their names?

Speaker 4:          00:19:42       Jesus fucking thing's broken. This faded. It sounds better than I did their show on there. I did their show a couple of weeks ago. Amazing. Those guys are hilarious. Really? Yeah. There's so much fun. They are a really good time and they have, they have such good rapport, like chemistry together. They're a blast. They're a blast. Yeah. And that show is, it's a fun show. They do like, you know, they just do commentary on a bunch of bullshit, whatever current events. Weird shit happening and then they just bring a guest on and they're very loose. Very funny guys. Man. That's good to hear. Yeah. We need more good people. Yeah. If you go to, if you go to bk next time, you should definitely do. Is that where they do it? Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. Advice offices there in Brooklyn. Yeah, five. I haven't had much time to do anything, man.

Speaker 4:          00:20:30       Yeah. Well you're scrambling a little busy scrambling. Yeah. No, it's good. It's good man. Speaking to current events. Is the president going to jail? I'm trying to figure this out. Is he going to jail? It seems like. Seems like some serious shit is going down. [inaudible] it sure feels like it is, you know, when it feels like it's really interesting. It's like a, it's like you're watching a show. It's a really entertaining show. Yeah, I mean I don't mind that house of cards is in production because this is a good show we're watching. Yeah, I mean it's ramping up whatever, whatever is going on. It's like they're building towards an event and it seems like they have been planning this, like they're systematically attacking different parts of his administration, getting people to fold, getting people to turn state's evidence, getting people to to plead guilty and they're slowly chipping away.

Speaker 4:          00:21:20       There's no way that the end result could be like, eh, that's it. We're done this. As far as we got, it feels like there's definitely a shoe's going to drop. Right? I mean, the crazy thing is they're going to get them for campaign financing because of his attorney paint off stormy Daniels. I think the thing that I read, I could be getting this wrong, is that it's that pay off within a certain number of days of the election, right? That starts to break a finance law. I guess because they said that that payment was within a certain number of days of the election. So what it means is that it's affecting the election potentially, is what. Yeah, what the accusation could be. Isn't that interesting? It's like you're paying someone to affect opinion and so that's like, it's a campaign finance violation. Yeah. It's also amazing that, I dunno, I mean I guess at the time somebody comes to you with that check and you're like, sure.

Speaker 4:          00:22:16       But in retrospect, thinking how much leverage she would've had done. If you go back then and, and, and she gets to say, you want me to keep this thing silent? No problem. But you need to up that check. Bill O'reilly, Bill paid one lady 32 million. Not. Did he do? No, that's not a squeezing an ass cheek. Right? What did he do? What did he do? First of all, how much money does he have? Thirty $2. Million is like, just pay it. Just pay it off. Just write it off. Yeah. What does that. A years our. They have a lot of fucking settlements. Roger ailes and seen the bit I'm doing on Fox News. No, it's one of my favorite belly. Oh, I love doing this will be in the new one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I look forward to seeing you there. So it's such a fascinating little place over there.

Speaker 4:          00:23:06       Yeah, and right now they're what they're doing for the most part. Not every show, but the show other than Tucker Carlson I think is one of the few guys over there that is, he seems. He seems the most reasonable. Really? Yes. You think he's more reasonable than like Shepard Smith? Wow. I never watched that guy. Well that guy is saying he has a. he's there, but he seems to have like a little more back, like unbiased. Balanced. They give you are doing ecstasy with Shepard Smith. He tried to kiss you? I hope so. I think I've been losing weight. Yeah, but the

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       rest of it. My point is the rest of this show seems like state run propaganda. Here's, and here's the thing. He also, when it's not a secret, it's kind of fascinating, right? That it's not a secret that he has real relationships with multiple on air talent. Like the president is like I'm friends with Jeanine Pirro. I'm really good friends with Sean Hannity. I'm really good. I've watched. Yeah, everyday. I watched a morning show called Fox and friends and as they report things I tweet out like policy change based on this morning show and it's not secret, like if you see the segment and then he's like, like there was this aired at 6:30 AM, 6:32. He's like we're going to have to do something about this shit, and they just did a segment on it and then that also throws his aids and his staff a curve balls because there'll be not expecting that he's going to bring this up, but he sees it on tv and there and then they have to go like, yeah, of course we are going to do that because keep him from the TV. Yeah, it's fucking nuts. He watches a lot of cable TV. They say watches eight hours a day. He doesn't like to go to the office early and that's one of my other favorite ones. Like the like John Kelly has been like, you've got to get here earlier.

Speaker 3:          00:25:04       That's hilarious. I said I sit out for a. He was showing up at 11 and that they were trying to get them to come at nine and then I think they settled on 10 or something. Yeah. Just want to get their fucking nine. That's ridiculous. Yeah. It's so interesting. They really. He doesn't get us into a war. Having him as the president will be very beneficial. Yeah. Yeah, because I think that we're going to realize how fucking crazy it is to give one person so much power based on a popularity contest. It. It does kind of highlight the absurdity of not just of him of the presidency. Right. Completely absurd. Yeah. We'd never do it that way today if we had no government at all, if we lived in some sort of Bizarro universe where a government had never been established when decided enough is enough.

Speaker 3:          00:25:50       We can't live with anarchy anymore. We need to have some sort of a system of rules, checks and balances and put an. We never say, all right, let's have a popularity contest. See One dude, and let's let them get financed by giant groups of people know. That shit's all. It's ridiculous. It's so fucked. I know this and then it seems like everybody agrees that that's fine, but they never changes. Yeah. I've been hearing for a decade plus about campaign finance reform stuff and then it's still, you know, powerful Super Pacs, collect them. Oh, we'll just find a loophole and then we get them money that way. I mean, nothing changes. Well, the just the amount of money and influence, it's all tied in together to try to completely shake that off. You'd have to get people to be 100 percent ethical. They would have to say, you know what?

Speaker 3:          00:26:38       This is just not the way to run the government. It's not right for the people, but they're not going to do that. Of course, too much influence. It just shows you how sneaky and snaky the whole thing is, but it's also really interesting too, because we're going to be forced with this guy because of all this fucking chaos. We're going to be forced to reexamine how we do things. Maybe it'll be a little change for the next president with the. I'm sorry. The real worry would be that he would get through eight years. Then one of his sons would take over. I guess it's not out of the realm of possibility. It's not even a little. I have this theory that I think he actually in a way will really relish and enjoy the midterms in November going Democrat because that totally feeds into his.

Speaker 3:          00:27:26       They're attacking and like being able to be like course nothing gets done because he's fucking concert or an office now and I think that he would really actually almost enjoy because he loves combative, combative relationship. I think he's actually going to. If it goes that way, I think he will like really enjoy it. I think so, but I also think that he likes winning though. He does like winning. Of course he likes winning and it's a compulsive. You can tell that when they'll, you know oprah, you're going to run. She's like, no. He's like, I hope she runs. Kick her fucking ass. He can't help himself. You know? He has that kind of competitive side to him. Yeah. No, he definitely does. Well they say they don't want them to testify because they know they're going to catch him lying there. Like, you can't do it.

Speaker 3:          00:28:11       Don't worry, I'm not gonna lie it. All his lawyers have said like, a hundred percent, don't do that. He was like, oh, I'll think about it. Which means that like, he, you know, because he, he says that a lot with uh, you can tell them when they have those off the cuff, you know, press, when he lets the press in, they'll ask him something, he'll be like, we'll see what happens. Which is totally like, I might do it, I might not, but you know, that everybody in his size, like please don't say anything at this point. They might not even be. They might be like, go ahead. Yeah, yeah. Go ahead. Tough guy. Go talk, go talk. Who knows, man, I'll get another job. How amazing would it be to watch that deposition or, or, you know, uh, interview. Do you remember when Bill Clinton was grilled about Monica Lewinsky?

Speaker 3:          00:28:56       The word is, yeah. Yeah. It's amazing. And just the term sexual relations, as I understand it, the way I understand the word, that's not it. Yeah. No, I mean that was fascinating. Eight. He's so shameless. Well, not just that, it's just, it seems so strange. Yeah. Back then in the 19 nineties to be able to watch the president in video get grilled and clearly they wanted to release this video to humiliate them. Of course, you know, but it was just bizarre. It's like I've never, we'd never seen anything like this. You've never seen a sitting president like getting grilled by people and especially about sex and the shift mode. Like uh, you know, we knew him as this. Obviously you'd see him on the campaign trail or meeting people. He's like this super charming, right? Like personable guy. Yeah. Really good at being basically a celebrity.

Speaker 3:          00:29:52       You don't really good at that. And he's like, you know, knows how to be a politician. But in that deposition, I mean he switched onto lawyer mode and, and like, I'm not here to charm you motherfucker, because he was spin on is what does is mean is like, I remember just, I mean I'm a kid, I think I was in high school watching that and be like, how does anyone struggle with is like, is this. And I didn't know he was like playing a game with them too, you know? Oh yeah. Well they were playing lawyer games. Yeah. Total war games. Trump can't do that. He's not smart enough to do that. No, he's not a lawyer. So he's not. I wouldn't say he's not. I don't think that trump is not smart. I think he's smart. I've, I've. Especially when you listen to interviews of him from the past, like he's like, there's some interviews in the past.

Speaker 3:          00:30:41       Very articulate. Yeah. And obviously been very successful in business, but I don't think he's an interested in expanding his horizons mentally. I don't think he's interested in reading. No, I don't think he also thinks that he really 100 percent does the, did run his business off of instinct and, and like gut and relationships and loyalty and stuff that he's promoting. When they say like, you can't do that here. He's like trucking, mark. I'm the president. Fuck off. People want it. Do you want to read this briefing? No, I don't like to be brief. I don't like to read. Yeah, he doesn't like to read. They say they put the word trump in his briefings a bunch of times, just so that he reads it screwed ahead. What? This is about me. What else about me? Amazing French. I don't know, man. It does feel like it's going to star report.

Speaker 3:          00:31:33       This is what? Yeah, blood to a star. Yeah. This will be like Miller's report that would be coming out maybe later this year or something like that. Is that the equivalent? I don't know. Uh, yeah. I guess if they get, if they get to a real special council report. Yeah, sure. The Mueller thing is so strange because technically can he fire Mueller? Well that's, there was a big article about whether or not. So the White House said that they believe that he does have the power to do that. But. And you don't know if that's. I mean, you would think that that means that they're sent. He just wants to put that signal out there, like, I can't do this. But there was other legal minds that said that he couldn't do it, that he would have to get a bra because sessions has recused himself from this. Uh, the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein is it, and that he would have to get him to do it and then they said that, you know, that he would, would not do that unless, I mean Rosenstein said he wouldn't do it unless a Mueller had done ms.ms dot

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       conduct. Right. So, and, and that if the president tried to get him do that, he would resign, in which case they would have to get another person either appointed to do it or whoever's below him to do it. So it's a, it's a really good episode. I can't remember a time where I felt like there was nobody at the wheel more than I do now. Yeah. It does feel like chaos. Like it's, there's all people that are in positions, you know, there's the secretary of state, there's the chief of staff, there's all these, there's all these different people that are in positions, but it feels like a, uh, like make believe and you know, what happens because this happens everywhere. We get lost in our experience of it because we live here. I'm really fascinated by how it looks outside of have here. Oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:33:30       Am I. It must really seem like an even crazier show. Oh, it's got to. And then Mike Pence is holding Bible study classes for the first time in 100 years in the White House lacked. Yeah. Really? And women aren't allowed to read what? Yes. No, no. Women read the Bible there. This is for real. No women. The women are not teaching. There's no women teaching these Bible study. No, he doesn't. He doesn't like dinner with that Mama there. No. No women next to him at dinner. Mike pence must be an animal. I'm just trying to keep it together. He just backed up the ball hog and yeah, just got to keep them away. No dinner with women. No women. Mike Penn Sponsors Whitehouse Bible study led by Anti Lgbtq anti women. Extremist. That this is real.

Speaker 4:          00:34:16       This is what we got to be careful for folks. We've got to be careful of this. This guy could be president and that ain't no better. This is. This guy is fucking radical. Radical. Fundamentalist Christianity. Yeah. Oh boy. Ooh. Let me see that little bit bigger. What does it say? Bible Study Group led by Ralph Drollinger, an extremist who says Lgbtq people are illegitimate. Secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo, attorney general jeff sessions and Education Secretary Betsy Devos attended the weekly sessions in Washington. While trolling ger claims he doesn't tell members, he's advised in the past how to vote. He notes that he would, in quotes, put the blueprint on the engineer's seat on the train. I don't know what's going on. People look to their faith as a source of guidance and inspiration and Lgbtq people in our family and friends are no different. Drone jurors, brand of faith, however, seeks to drive a wedge between the LG, that lgbt thing.

Speaker 4:          00:35:21       First of all, how did trans people get locked in with queer people or gay people? Isn't that a different thing? It is. I think they're just all marginalized. Marginalized groups. Yeah, but they do. You know there's a to an a plus. Do you know that? Yes. Now it's a and a plus. This is like a. This is an abbreviated list, but if you really want to be completely not inclusive, you have to include asexual people as well. They feel marginalized because they're not trans than not gay. They're not straight, they just not sex weight. Why cute? Q for Queer Queer, but why is that as African Gay and lesbian? Because it's just Ahmad. I'm just a weird guy.

Speaker 4:          00:36:02       I don't know. What is queer? I don't know. I thought that men, people right now are screaming at us. Gendered assholes. CISGENDER, white, white, privileged assholes. Pretty wealthy to um, I don't know. Acu. Why? That is different. Why? What is queer? What is the devastating what? It's good because we're used to be just gain gay. Right? So Google what is the cue and Lgbtq and then let's get into a. and a plus is asexual as a plus. By the way. A huge thanks. I got a huge gift. Goodie bag. Can I say thanks to the roots of fight guy? Oh, this is a great soccer going on right now. That's crazy. Julio Cesar Chavez shirt. We didn't even plan that. We did not plan this. I came home to a bunch of free shit, like the best. Okay. LGBT G, L or G L B e t on what is initialism? Initialism. I never said that word before.

Speaker 4:          00:37:01       That stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender. To recognize this inclusion. A popular variant adds the queue for those who identify as queer or are questioning their sexual identity. That makes you like. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Talking about Andy Dick. Yeah, I might be. It might be. I might be. I'm not sure. Or at least that's an answer. It's fence sitters. Yeah, I'm here. I'm there. They should have to fence it and my genders, whatever. Yeah. What is it? Movement. A fluid gender fluid. That's my favorite. You're a girl. One day a boy. The next day I had somebody email me too. They said at work they said, you know, you can pick your gender for emails, for company emails. So like this person picked a agenda and he's like, I think I'm going to do this. And I said, well what if your gender is changing?

Speaker 4:          00:37:53       I think you should send them an email every day. So it'd be like today. Yeah. He's like, I'm going to try it. See what happens. What do they. They can't say shit. I guess they can't. No, you can't say shit all. You have to just keep a straight face today. Identify as a woman. You, you literally can do whatever you want. Definitely. Yeah. Which I mean, and then people argue that you should have the right to do that, to change whenever you want. I guess. I mean it's not convenient for everyone, but I guess you can. Yeah, I guess you can. It's not the worst thing in the world. No. But when, when do we call it nonsense?

Speaker 4:          00:38:32       Yeah. I guess there would be a limit because if you switched it on the hour, like get the fuck Outta here with that. Yeah. Well what if you decide that you like identify with things that aren't even real? Like elves does Elf kin. It's a good point. I think I would have you just decide that I'm in now. But again, if somebody came in your office, especially if they were a valuable employee and they were like, I'm an Elf and they had a straight face and you're like, you're a high producer here at the company. Okay. But if someone comes into your office and they're a woman and they say, today I'm a man. Yeah, today. Yes. And I reserved the right to be a woman back again tomorrow. Okay. Yeah. Do you have a penis? No. No, just to man, man. Today.

Speaker 4:          00:39:17       Okay. There they, they're letting you decide whether or not you can accept nonsense. That's true. I mean, here's the thing, it's, it's spreading though. It is growing and it's really a matter of how many people that don't do that except that this is a new reality. Well, and then there's also the thing that we all know is that some people have an extreme desire to be special without doing any work whatsoever. Yeah. They don't want to have to work to be special. They just want to be special. So if they can just say there's a lot of them on instagram. Yes. Instagram. Yeah. If they could just say they're a part of some marginalized group, then instantaneously they get more respect and this is not taken away from the people that I think are legitimately trans. I think there's definitely people that are legitimately transfers.

Speaker 4:          00:40:05       I think those people that are legitimate, Lee Trans, she'd be upset at these gender fluid. Fucking weird. I was bouncing back and forth all day. There's a radio lab about that where the guy decides during the conversation that he's a man and then he's a woman. Now I switched over. Now I'm Paul, now I'm betty. I just changed. How do we address that as 100 percent? Either you're fucking with me or you're mentally ill, right? You can't say mentally ill when it comes to gender. That's the one area where mentally ill, like if it's violence. Okay. If it's impulsive things like gambling or something along those lines, all that stuff. You could say you're mentally ill. You cannot say you're mentally ill when it comes to gender. Why? Because we're scared. We're scared of being called out, but if somebody is like, I'm talking right now and they switch and this switch gender again, then they switched and they switched the fourth time in an hour conversation.

Speaker 4:          00:40:57       We're supposed to just be like, that's exactly that fucking dude that we've been sending each other back and forth. Homeboys, instagram. What is his name? Kyle. Done again? Holy Shit. Is he funny? He's so funny. He's. There's a guy named kyle done again. He's on instagram and he's doing that face swap thing. He takes Caitlyn Jenner's face and Kim Kardashians space in all the family. He does all. He does all their voices on a fake face times. Oh. And then he does. He'll do trump talking to sessions. He uh, he's really good. He's a really funny comic. I've never seen his standup,

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       but my favorite instagram place over this play this. So

Speaker 5:          00:41:39       I'm close to my first female orgasm isn't quite working.

Speaker 5:          00:42:00       You did some shit on there.

Speaker 6:          00:42:05       You're distracting me.

I could get 44,000 people just change. That is one of the best instagram pages. I've reposted his videos. There's. So what does this one? Sure.

Go see him now. God. Holy Shit. And just go to his instagram. You spend your whole day because his instagram is one of the one of the few instagrams where literally everything's funny. Yeah, like half of my shit. I'm most of my shit. I'm not trying to be funny. No, that guy's funny on all of them. It's just a. it's a party. Fucking hilarious man. Guess what? Chicken Butt Horn. Mothered. Sleeping. Trump impressions of hilarious. I know him and bite. That was nuts when him and biden were talking shit on twitter about fighting Biden. Oh, Cindy's. He kick his ass. His ass by the trumps like you'd go down quick, quick.

Speaker 4:          00:45:27       You ever think there was gonna be a time in your lifetime where the president of the United States was saying would kick someone's ass? No. Kick your ass easy, easy, and he doesn't even fight the keys. He doesn't even exercise at all. He said he would run. He would have run into that Parklin and school without a. without a gun. Yeah. I would have run. I'll run in there without a course. I would have. Would have taken the guy out. It's nuts. It's nuts to say that if that was the only thing he had said in the last year, people were like, that is fucking a fascinating guy. It's a fascinating study and watching someone like we, we have this strange attraction to people that have like powerful confidence like that. Like we want to watch it play out that guy. We don't want to watch that guy. Just play out watches confidence here goes watch, watch them.

Speaker 4:          00:46:16       Well, a lot of people are really attracted, really attracted instinctively, intuitively to somebody with the WHO, you know the balls to say anything. Oh yeah. That's a really appealing quality to a lot of people. Yeah, we've never had one like this though, right? No. Well he was fun when he was on the contender or whatever the fuck it was. The apprentice. Yeah, he was fun. Yeah, and like a stern always said that, you know, he's like, I've had a great guest. Yeah, there's always a great guest. It's a funny, but he cultivated that whole thing his whole life and then all of a sudden you become president. You're supposed to be a different thing. He's like, no, no, no, I am. It's what I do. Bang Hoes, man. Did you see me? Said that he asked me. He asked me to check on the pep story. Yeah, because Melania was like, serious, you made him piss on you didn't. I swear that's not true and I'm going to get the FBI on the case on the pis tapes. Get them on the piss tapes. That's how confident I am. That cold call me. Can you look into that? Do I have your loyalty? Checking those pits tapes on real man. Crazy man. That'd be another thing. Would be fun to watch other pis tapes. He's fun for comedy though. Tell you what, because he's, he's like, Eh, at the same time

Speaker 2:          00:47:31       you're seeing this massive political correctness backlash where like people are angry at, at him and they, they're like pushing really hard and the other direction. So it's created this very volatile social environment. You know the, the Zeit geist yeah. Verizon. It's possible. Trump was with hookers peeing on each other. It's possible. Well, how did he say that in an interview? Right? How did he say it though? I want to hear it like his actual words. If it's on here, this is to. He says it's possible. It could it be like, I don't know,

Speaker 8:          00:48:12       per conversation about how the trump team would position this and what they could say about this. They actually started talking about drafting a press release with us still sitting there and the reason that was so striking to me is that that's just not done. That the intelligence community does intelligence. The White House does pr and spin. You also said you were struck by what? They didn't ask very much. No one to my recollection asked, so what? What's coming next from the Russians? How might we stop it? What's the future look like? It was all might not come up. What can we say about what they did and how it affects the election that we just had call me then asked to meet alone with trump, but was it a longer than trump's ties to Russia, including allegations of trump's encounters with prostitutes, Moscow. I'm about to meet with a person who doesn't know me.

Speaker 8:          00:49:10       It's just been elected president of the United States by all accounts and from my watching him during the campaign could be volatile and I'm about to talk to him about allegations that he was involved with prostitutes in Moscow and that the Russians taped it and have leverage over him. Was there any choice there a why? If this was salacious and this particular part of the dossier? Unverified. Still unverified by the way? Yes. So far as when I got fired, it was unverified. Did you tell him that the steele dossier had been financed by his political opponents? No, I didn't. I don't even think I used the term steele dossier. I just talked about additional material, but did he have a right to know that that had been financed by his political opponents? That I don't know the answer to, that it wasn't necessary for. My goal was

Speaker 2:          00:50:01       okay for us to play to get us to stop a second ago. We can't really play that I the whole thing. That's what I was. Yeah. At the minute. Are we gonna get in trouble? I don't think so. I don't know. I'm gonna come down on us. No, I mean it might notice a ABC News owns this interview, so. MMM. Yeah. Okay. Cut it out then. Either way. Let's take it from here. There's some APP, some he said it's possible. So people listening, we just played it. Jamie's going to edit it out later so we don't get in trouble. We don't get pulled off of Youtube. Yeah, it should be okay. But. But I'm just madness. The whole thing is just so crazy. I just, I'm glued to my seat. I can't, I, I can't see where it's going. I know, I know. It's why, uh, there's so much coming at every day that there's, you know, you realize that there's entire entertainment shows now just addressing the reality.

Speaker 2:          00:50:56       That is our political spectrum now. Why doesn't he have to take a pee test? You have to take a peek. Trump, you have to take a pee test. If you work at ups, they had to check. You give me something. Yeah. Interesting. I think he's on speed. You do 100 percent. He doesn't sleep. He doesn't sleep a lot. There's a lot of energy and there's some evidence from many different reporters that one reporter even named the pharmacy where he used to get a speed. He was on diet pills that you're only supposed to take for a little while. He took him for like six years and then there was another reporter we talked about recently that was saying that he's on one of the fence. He's won one of those now, which totally makes sense. He is 70 what? Seventy one? Seventy one? Yeah. How does he have so much fucking energy?

Speaker 2:          00:51:45       Yeah. That guy has a shit ton of energy. I mean, when he was on the campaign trail, he just would go, go, go. It was like three stops of fucking day, you know, getting on plane land somewhere. I do a rally good. No Problem Eating Kentucky Fried Chicken wasn't eating healthy fried chicken. I know. And uh, yeah man, I think he's on speed and it makes me want to get on speed pace. We want to be more productive. I mean that's, there's so many people I know that are on adderall. So many. I've never tried it. I never have either. Jamie gave me some of them scared, just sitting around. Do you watch that documentary yet? No, it just talks about how many people are on. It just is crazy. So many all day everyday. Well, um, my stem cell doctor was telling me that when he was in medical school that the people that it was with, like all the, you know, the people who's going to school with, they were all taken adderall and he was like, I would watch them finish papers and I just couldn't understand where they had the energy from.

Speaker 2:          00:52:40       And he's like, dude, we're on adderall. Like this is the way to go and just like, Holy Shit. He's like, it makes you feel like you have to get on it because all these people are so, so productive when they're on it. I've heard comics talk about it to comics really don't think I would think you'd be to ramped up. I think when they said they had like a lot of work to do those jobs and they're like, I gotta get this done and get that done. Yeah. Yeah. The downsides got to be rough though. Uh, I don't. Yeah. I don't know anything about it really. I mean I know that it's popular and people have been taking it for, but I mean like when you come off it, I'm sure Jamie did you ever. You did it right? I did it twice I think, but I think I also took two different versions of it because there's different kinds. There's not just like, was it in a row and now you're taking

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       adderall? Was it to work? Or like just recreation had like art projects or something. I was trying to get done. Like I really wanted to get it done. I was also interested to see what it would be like because I've never taken it and I've heard friends take it. Some, some of my friends really just take it to drink more, most of it because we're not in college anymore, you know? But uh, yeah. So the one time I took it I had a day off and it kept me up the whole time, which is what I thought would happen. But then the next day I was also, I was just still up. I tried to go to bed, couldn't go to, couldn't fall asleep with a, it's out of your system. It's just a little bit to like five milligrams, maybe 10 of the slow release because there's also fast release. You can pop the pill and take the salts directly in without having a time release. So there's different variations. What about the day after that? Do you just crash? Super. It was fine. I was normal. I just thought I was. I was afraid to go to work. So I was serving. I thought I was going to crash while I was serving people's tables and drop food everywhere. I have the day off, so. Yeah. Right, right. Hmm. Oh, you remember Robert Schimmel? Yeah. He accidentally took it once. Accidentally. He got the. So not bob shoveled personality. They.

Speaker 2:          00:54:25       No, it's not. Yeah. He was like super mellow. But uh, he told me, uh, he accidentally took it and he called his doctor panicking because he had serious heart condition. Yeah. And the doctor said, you're going to be fine. Just, it's just gonna. It's gonna last for about 12 hours. And he goes, man, I got so much shit done. He goes, I just sat in front of my computer and organize my notes. I got all my act together just makes you really productive apparently, but we're gonna you know, it's going to change the way people interact. It's going to change the way he made. If more and more people continue to do this, going to change the way people feel about other people, they're going to be all jazzed up. You think he's on some version of that president? Yes. Yes. I want to try it.

Speaker 2:          00:55:10       And I think if these, if these reporters are correct, pull up that story about the reporter that even listed the Duane Reed pharmacy in New York where trump was on the shit for six years and then they think that trump is on something now and they even specified the stuff that he's on. Hillary was on some shit too. She's on either in new vigil or pro vigil. They're both very similar. Um, but that's the stuff that they give to narcolepsy. People with narcolepsy. Really awake. Yeah. It's amazing. It keeps you awake, man. If you have to drive, he'd pop on them. New vigils. That's an interesting one because it doesn't give you the same sort of speediness I'm really bad at night driving. I feel tired. Those lines they started hitting into just to embrace you will, we'll keep you calm. And if you, if it's warm, if you're in a cold place, you know the heat on in the car, that's rough. Cold with heat driving by yourself on the rope. No good. Especially with no lights on the road.

Speaker 2:          00:56:13       Night, night, night, night. Have you ever fallen asleep and woken yourself up? Changing lanes? Yes. That's terrifying. Yeah. It's not good and secure as it should and it scares the shit out of me fighting Jeremy. I can't find him because he took it off the Internet. He had the boys cleaned it up. Why's? Why that? Michael Cohen on that case got a big Dick. Michael Cohen, that Guy Hilarious. All of them in. It's like where do they go from characters, man? It was real weird. Nothing was coming up on Google like it really was being taken off really well. I found it. Yeah. Hmm. Okay. Fun Fact. Nineteen 82. Trump started taking amphetamine derivatives. Abused them. Only supposed to take two for 25 days. Stayed on him for eight years. Really? Wow. Right. Here's the White House. Admitted it to me saying only for a short time for diet when he was not overweight.

Speaker 2:          00:57:08       I countered with medical records. They cut me off. People misreading drug was die. Ethel probe, p n d I e t h y l p r o p t I o n 75 milligrams a day prescription filled at Duane reed on 57th street in Manhattan. Not that I know things get crazy. I'm the doctor wrote the prescription Dr Joseph Greenberg diagnosed him with metabolic imbalance, which we have never heard about. Again. Greenberg was later publicly slammed as someone who would provide uppers to rich people in Manhattan, metabolic imbalance, if true could be an electrolyte insufficiencies, anaerobic imbalances, acid imbalances, and as sort of an assortment of related disorders that can have serious health consequences. Yet his other doctor, Dr Harold Bornstein said, been trump's dr since 1988. Never mentioned the metal bulk and balance found by Greenberg. So this guy would just like Tommy, you've got a medical imbalance or metabolic metabolic imbalance.

Speaker 2:          00:58:17       What I say here, take these, take these. What are they? That's fucking great. That's what they are. How do I take it? Before, I don't know, eight years, but there was another one. Yeah, there's. That's the amphetamine. A drug of phenylalanine. See, this is m, m fab pra Moan, and fet promotes a stimulant of the phenol phen phen phen asylum mean amphetamine. So this is the shit they think he's on now. Yeah, that's what came up when I grew up with that. Yeah, they think he's on something now. I think. Look man, I think this is a not so dirty little secret. I don't think there's anything wrong with it. We take coffee. That's a stimulant. Sure. These people are just taking pills. Yeah, I don't think he does. Right. Isn't he like a not a coffee guy? No, I don't think he drinks coffee.

Speaker 2:          00:59:06       I don't think he drinks booze at all. No. No. So, so he's just in the uppers diet coke though, right? Yeah. Like 19 dcs. Press downs. Those. Yeah. It's crazy. That's caffeine, right? You well, yeah, he's definitely into caffeine. So he drinks the caffeine all day and he's taken these uppers and that's how he gets shit done for America. That's how it brings coal back. Yeah. It's bringing sexy back to strange mean the, those pills. The thing about when you think about amphetamines, when you think about brash decisions, think about people that are overly, overly confident, you know, arrogant. Like, look, this is exactly what you expect from him. Totally. Super aggressive. Yeah. It doesn't strike me as a crazy conspiracy. No. To say that that's happening. It's fascinating. But now that's my question, like why don't they test them? Yeah. We found out he's off the charts.

Speaker 2:          01:00:03       You get his charts backing like, whoa. It's just like cocaine out of control. He's like, yeah, whatever. I do an eight ball a day. So a ball while here. A little there. What do you think Putin's doing? Trying to keep the wolves out of our door. Do you see that video that was going around yesterday of the dog that got killed by the two wolves? Oh No, it was horrible. German shepherd. Oh, don't show it please. German shepherd. They dragged it out of the yard and they're killing it in the street on security camera. We're like, we're part of the, I don't know, somewhere in a community. It's a neighborhood neighborhood though. I mean it's like a paved street here. Coyotes at night. I see them during the day, sometimes two running down the street. One killed my chicken last week. Really? Two weeks ago, two weeks ago. And another one got a chicken.

Speaker 2:          01:00:46       Do you feel like you're just gone around the other day? They were on the roof of the chicken. The Hen house plucking at the pulling of the chicken wire, trying to pull the chicken wire off. Ooh. Yeah. Especially if they're do it for the roof. They do it from the roof. They're going to fall in and if they fall, fallen, they going to be stuck in the chicken coop. Just kill them all and yeah, they'll just kill them all and then I'll kill them. Yeah. But that's just fucked. What would you do? Shoot him? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I wonder if my neighbors would tell the cops if they're heard pop, pop, pop. We just hit him with a gun. That shotgun fucking head checking. Uh, I don't know what I would use. It'd be hard to shoot him with a bow because I'd have to get them to sit still.

Speaker 2:          01:01:27       Right. Well I drew back and then they'd be running around the chicken coop. So I'd be in there with them in the chicken coop. No. Good. Like what would they do? Would they attack me? Maybe. Maybe if they're feeling panicked to that panic, they felt trapped. It certainly will be running around in circles with whether or not they decide to just leap at me, bite my face off. Maybe a rifle. That'd be the easiest. Probably loud as fuck. Super loud. Yeah. You, you have a couple of those going off in the backyard. People gonna call the cops. Oh yeah. But then would you get in trouble for that? I don't think you're supposed to shoot a gun in your yard, Tom. Yes, but what if you feel threatened? Well, if you were, if someone was breaking into your home and threatening your life and you shot them, that would be one thing. Defensive Life and property. That's not this. This is like you have a varmint in your backyard. I don't think you'd get in trouble for killing coyotes. Coyotes

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       are thought of as like rats as crazy as that because we have a hierarchy when it comes to animals. Right? Yeah. I mean we love, we love dogs and cats, but we don't really give a shit about mice. No. Oh No. Everywhere you go. You buy mice traps. Snap their necks. Electrocute them. Yeah. Yeah. Even glue traps. Those are the worst mice. Get stuck on the glue. Put One of those. I tell you that like 10 years ago I lived in silver lake. I see rats crawling over here. Rats. You see rats all the time. I went to this at this office. I was working part time and they go, uh, the guy was like, oh, just take these, uh, take these rat traps with you, like glue traps and they'll get stuck in it and uh, it, it's perfect. That's what you should do.

Speaker 4:          01:03:03       So I took it, put some peanut butter on it, like you said, put it in the backyard and the next day they were flipped over and shit on. It's like the rat step. Then it was like, fuck this, flipped it over and took a shit on it. Like, fuck you, man. I was like, I told him. He was like, oh, that's pretty big rat then. Okay. I caught a big one in my backyard, my garage rather when I lived in Encino, uh, the, the, the trap came down, snapped his neck, killed him. I went out there, he's up fat boy. I was like, Ooh, there's a big rat. I'm like, I'll get that in the morning. I just left it out there. I went back in the morning. It was eating everything except the tail. They ate him though. Yeah, that makes sense. On each other. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:03:46       Yeah, yeah. The tear each other up. Did you see that rats documentary on Netflix? No. Woo. Say it should. I don't like rats scare you. Yeah. I don't need it in my head. I don't need it. Need it. Jeremy saw it. Right. It's fucking great. Let me just makes you realize the sheer volume of them in American cities everywhere. Oh yeah. It's more rats in New York City than there are people. They said that they'll get through the, you know, or mice. At least we'll get through a hole the size of a dime or something like that. They're flexible and they're. They just shove their way in. They're not like us. They're crazy. They're crazy smart. To the older rats, they'll send younger rats to go check on bates and stuff like that. Or someone leaves behind rat bait that is poisoning. The old rats will sit back like, man, I don't think so on the young rats, like, move over here.

Speaker 4:          01:04:35       Was that food? Your car, your car is not going to eat. You're not going to eat. Good man. Good. I eat and then he'll eat and die and they'll go, yep. I thought so. So because of that, they've developed poisoned. That takes like 10, 11 hours to kick in. So one rattle eat it. He's like, how are you feeling? I'm feeling great, I'm fine, I'm fine. And then the other rats will eat it too because they're like, oh, he's okay. And then yeah. So they're, they're, they're developing these slow release poisons, but then you just have this rotting rat like you're not stop. There's no way you're going to eradicate the problem. Like if someone said, hey, I've got a solution to completely eliminate all the rats were New York City, like, no you don't. Is there no solution? There's no solution isn't. No. Unless you little robot rats that eat rats.

Speaker 4:          01:05:21       Oh right. All they do is eat rats. That's what you'd have to let loose. He'd have to let loose a scourge. Just a pack of robot rat eating rats that only eat rats and they can do what rats do there. That's the one that had a bought flying. It's body that was like the size of a football. What was in his body? A Bot fly that lava. See that whole next to his neck. That was a. There was a parasite in there that was that big. That's like if you had a soccer ball growing out of your chest. Yeah, and the rats dead and that thing is alive still. Really? Yeah. It's in the dock. Yeah, on the. And they were finding all these crazy diseases that are just totally fatal, just floating around inside the rat's body and rats, like they're fine, but it would kill us.

Speaker 4:          01:06:08       How's that happened? Oh, there's a foul, foul little creature. So fat. Why don't we just set like all these sewers on fire that's going to work like a little kid then? Yeah, it's like a little kid solution. Just fucking poor gasoline in the sewage, but there's certain problems that we just don't have an answer to. That's the problem of rats in cities. They don't have an answer to. I mean you can mitigate it by controlling your trash or this or that. There's a few things you could do to sort of keep them like at least at bay, but they're going to be hungry and they're going to be searching around and people are always going to leave garbage. There's always going to be food in New York, in New York City. Right. So much filth. How many rats do you think are in Manhattan? Oh, let's see how many people. I think there's $7,000,000. This is about eight point 6 million pa point 6 million people. I'd say 13 million rats come. I'm going to go with 24. This estimate says there are approximately 33 point $6 million, which is as many as five rats per person.

Speaker 4:          01:07:12       So many. Wow. That's. How do they get that? And there's different ones. Uptown and downtown. There's a dip. Genetically Genetically Distinguishable groups. How many groups to to genetically distinguishable groups of uptown and downtown? They have those uppity. Uptown Rats, upper west side, rat hoes. Fucking upper east side. The lounge in those cool soho rats. Bark has genetically distinct uptown and downtown that is fucking crazy. There's so many of them too, and when you see them there's like. It's such a like an instantaneous feeling of panic and like moving quickly. I'm terrified of them. I don't like it at all. No ones running around your house like Jesus. Oh Man. Oh Man. I to get my son. He's over there. I just want to run away. I've had friends that were camping and one ran over their face while they're sleeping. That caring pizza. Do you ever seen the one that kills a pigeon? You see the rat killing the pigeon. This rat killed a fucking pigeon and was

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       killing it in front of all these people in New York City in a park. Look at this. Whoa. Yeah. Killing the pigeons. The pigeons alive. The rat got ahold of the pigeon and look how much stronger they are. Then pigeons, he's just carrying that poor fucking pigeon around. He's taking a break now who winded fucking hard out there carrying and he's like, he's really trying to do the choke hold on him. He's killing it. I mean, he's a Predator like I never would have imagined. I never thought that rats are predators. Yeah. I thought of him as just being sort of scavengers, but this is. This is fucking pigeons alive, dude. He's eating this pigeon and he's killing it. Drag it in a way. Look at him. Oh yeah. He's taken this. Wow. Look at. He's trying to get away. Fuck you. Fuck you. Pigeons. All jacked.

Speaker 2:          01:09:01       Pigeons trying to get away trying. No, that's chasing them. Look at that. That is so whoever's doing the camera. There's terrible at it. He got it. That's wild, man. He's going. Oh, we dropped it. Oh, where are you going with still alive? Yeah, in a man. It's fighting book. I was writing it. I was like, he's got back control and said the first time doing it, you know he's bobbing, killing. He's like, that one changed. That'd been killing birds for a minute, man. He realized like, you know what man? Fuck cheeseburgers. You can get your own fresh meat fresh. Got It. Do you know the pigeons were actually brought in for food? No. That's what squad is. When you go to a fancy restaurant and have a squabble pigeon. Pigeon. Yeah. I went to a restaurant the other day that had squabbles it good. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          01:09:48       I didn't need it. It's probably good. What'd you have? I had steak instead of tried and true, but squabbles like pigeon. They brought them in for food that's not as a non native bird. Their squad. There you go. Little pigeon dish looks good. Fire Grill looks good there and that funny though, they have to call it squad. It's like nobody wants to eat it. It wasn't pigeon. Yeah. That wouldn't sell as well. People aren't eating pigeons. Plug that those pigeons. Goddamn squad farm in Los Angeles. Back in the design. Yeah. All these things I think. I believe they brought them in. I want to say from Europe, but I might just be guessing that. But pitches or non native? Yeah. La was once home to the largest pigeon. Fuck God. Damn. That's crazy. That's near, isn't it? Near Dodgers Stadium, right? Right. Yeah. Christian Park. Was it Alucien Park now?

Speaker 2:          01:10:39       Why are they just sitting there? It's a painting, but. Oh, is it? Yeah. Yeah, but why would they be sitting there? There must be ton of feed there. Right? Right. And then how do they get them throw nuts over him at the end of the day? I don't know when they want to eat them. Yeah, there was a food source. They brought them over as a food source from where? Like just I guess I want to say Europe. Yeah, but the alligator farm. Oh, great assholes. You see that they had a 14 footer and someone's pulling in Florida. Yeah. Big fucking cage. Oh Wow. This little babies playing with alligators. The fuck is that 19. Oh, six people were just different than they were made out of wood or hardy. Even babies had callouses.

Speaker 2:          01:11:27       That is some shit that would not be done today to leave your kid by the gator pool. Oh yeah. Cool. Normal. We'll go have lunch. That's not really. Yeah, it is. Are. Yeah, California Alligator Farm Los Angeles. If they're well fed, you don't really have to worry about them. Their welfare. They're just tired. Just chilling all the time. Look at that guy though. It doesn't even look. You're a real person. Real fake. It's fake. It looks real fake. I just think it's just shitty shitty photography and they probably added color to it later. So Tommy buttons yet. Tell me about the controversy surrounding your use of the r word in your last special. Oh yeah, it was good that that was, that was bizarre. It was a lot man. It was. Well it was also. What I found interesting about it was people were lying about the bit and they were doing it in articles and they were doing it in email campaigns. They were lying about the content of the bit. There were changing what you were saying in the bit and the. They had to be doing it on purpose. They definitely didn't listen to the bit.

Speaker 3:          01:12:34       Yeah. And I think it took me a while to figure out what was, what really was happening was that someone, someone's agenda or idea of what they want to accomplish is to highlight a campaign to eradicate saying a word and then they had a channel to pursue by having a comedy bit that did it, but they could be like, let's, let's go after it like this. Yeah, but it didn't, they didn't go. I mean, you know, basically what it was funny thing is that like the, that joke was something that I worked back when I did that bit backwards. In other words, I had the end piece of the bit, uh, was that while I was doing by itself, which was a story about I saw, I witnessed a fight in Philly, have a white guy, a black guy in the park, and the white dude was screaming and bombs and it was, it was nuts.

Speaker 3:          01:13:31       So I would tell that story and then I would, I worked backwards into getting into the story because I always try to figure out like if something funny happens or something I want to tell a story, it's always better to figure out why are you telling the story than just to be like, here's the story. Right. So I told the story of the, the fight in the park. Then I worked into, like I figured out right before that I'm talking about racial slurs and how, you know, most racial slurs are not acceptable. And then I figured out they were like, unless they're like white racial slurs are totally acceptable, like call people mix and crowds and frogs, polacks Guinea wipes like this whole list of that. And then I worked before that, just the way into saying that was like, why should talk about words that you can't say that that kind of changed over time.

Speaker 3:          01:14:18       Right. So it was just like one of those jokes. It's like, oh, it's helping me get into the bit, you know. So I, I, I started the bit by saying, uh, you can't say retarded anymore, does the, that's the first line of the, of the entire bit, which ended up being like eight or 10 minutes long. And then people would say to me like, to start with, when I started getting mail about it, they're like, you know, you can't say retarded. And I go, that's the line that I say like, yeah, that's the line in the joke. But they didn't hear the bet. He will just heard that you were doing a bit about the word retarded once it blew up. Like once it got to a huge amount of, uh, like when it was an organized, orchestrated campaign, you're right, there was people messaging me that would say, um, I heard you want to kill all children with down's.

Speaker 3:          01:15:06       And I'd be like, what, where did you see that facebook somewhere said it. Someone said it does have the message messages I started to get and how many people at the height of it sign this petition to get you kicked off in that floats over 100,000. Yeah. But here's the thing, here's what I mean. I don't want to portray myself as a victim or anything, right? Like I, I did a bit. I can handle people not liking it or liking it. I mean, a lot of people message me that they were into it and I just didn't share those because you don't want to be like, here's someone who said they like it, you know, and people and people, even people with a children and siblings and, and, uh, with downstream messaged me, you know, I just didn't post those messages. But I don't know, I, I'm not the victim in this whole thing at all.

Speaker 3:          01:15:53       I learned, I feel like I learned that when people are super upset about something, you have to let them just be upset and be outraged if they want to be outraged, you know, that's, you're right. It, of course it's uncomfortable to me that you can't get out in front and be like, Hey, you're, you're misrepresenting it. Because people, like even in the campaign language it said like, we want this bit taken out of the, of the joke. We went the trailer for the special removed and I was like, why? And then I realized that the trailer has a joke that they're confusing with the joke where I say retarded, like they're, they think the two are related. What's the one on the trailer? The trailer is, I say, uh, uh, like some of something's funny. Um, disabilities are not funny, but some are, and it's a whole bit about obscure things like a foreign accent syndrome and oh, it was hit on the head and then they start speaking in French.

Speaker 3:          01:16:54       So that was the setup to that bit. And they were, but they were saying they were basically making it where that setup is about downs or something. You know what I mean? Like, but they happened 40 minutes apart. One has nothing to do with the other, but by not it, by just watching the trailer, they're going, oh see, this is like how he's making fun of us will. You shouldn't even have a point where you could say some disabilities are funny. Right? You, she can't do that. Right? Yeah, that's what, that's what I was told. It's, it's what it is, is the new power that people have to complain. I mean people have always complained but they haven't had the instantaneous access to complaining and then you can get. And here's the thing I learned about Kinda like mob mentality too. That was kind of fascinating to watch.

Speaker 3:          01:17:39       I mean I was in it so it's different. Once I could step back, I realized that once you get signed to a certain message out, you know, people would read the thing that says this guy hates people with downs. And I'm like, what? And that's not a hard thing to get behind. Oh yeah, so then people would just, they would sign it and I would also get messages that said things like, uh, I didn't know evil like you existed in this world, you know, things like that, and I'd be like, what, and you're isis. I mean, like really crazy stuff man. And I didn't engage nearly, you know, the, the amount of people that, that would contact me. But I did engage a few. I did like go back and forth with one guy. He was like, he opened, he was like, you fucking cock sucking piece of shit.

Speaker 3:          01:18:27       I would stab you if I saw you on the street. And I go, what's this all about? That was my, like my opening thing to him and he was like, I heard you, uh, you want to kill everybody with Down's syndrome. And I'm like, what are you talking about men? And then we had a back and forth about, about the bit. I'm like, you should go watch it, you know, just watch it and then get back to me. And then he writes me that. He was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. The way I spoke earlier didn't was fucking seriously was stabbed me. He saw me. He would have killed me. You'd be in jail forever. They'd be like a defendant, please rise. Well, I just dabbed Mr Herrera. I didn't see the bits. I didn't walk. I didn't watch the bed. Somebody told me it was a but at the St.

Speaker 3:          01:19:08       terrible things about in the now in there and people's defense who got upset. Some people watched it and they're like, I saw it. I don't think it's horrible and I think, you know, I'm like, okay. You know? Yeah. But there's some people that if you just say the word, say the word retarded, like that's it, it's over. You can't do that. It's like so many other words. Yeah. But it's gotten to the point where you don't even say the word Nigger, like just saying it. It's like, Holy Shit, what are you doing? We'll say the n word instead of it. Right. And you're not even calling someone yet, but it just acknowledging it that that's a real word. It's like a forbidden thing. Well, part of this campaign is to refer to it as the r word, like. Yeah, say it right. You should never say it.

Speaker 3:          01:19:53       I mean, it's weird, man. Yeah, I mean, you know, people. People were, some people were very, very upset about it and you know, I, I get why someone could be upset about it. It's not like I go like, I don't even understand how you can be upset. I mean, the natural thing I think if you're a comic is you want to walk someone through the joke, but what you realize later is like somebody who's, who's, who's advocating to stop saying a word that doesn't care the details of the joke. I mean the joke. Here's the other thing that sucks about reading. People would read transcripts. It's like, transcripts have no intent tone. You know, if you just read people's like, I know we've talked about what your closing on now, which will probably close out your special. If you just type that out and give us the one, they'd be like, you like, you're a horrible man, but it's in a couple of days.

Speaker 3:          01:20:49       It's like it's in the context of a comedy show where there's an unspoken agreement between performer and audience. It's the intent. Like what? How did you intend this bit to go tone? You mean is it said satirically? Ironically, that bit what I'm doing in the bit is, is basically lamenting but accepting that words are changing, right? Like that's the tone of it. The tone of it is I'm going like, can't say retarded anymore. That fucking sucks. But I'm also like, alright, you know what I mean? Like you're saying, okay, you want to do it, and I make an example. Like one thing that people got really upset about it was like I said, at the end of this bit of the retarded part, I say like you got now you got to be like that. Your idea has an extra 21st chromosome if you asked me. Right. And then the next part, the very next line that they would cut out when people were sharing this thing is I go like, not the same meaning that the example was they purposely bad example. The joke is that if you were to say 21st chromosome, it's absurd. It doesn't work like you wouldn't make it, but people would attack me and go like you're telling people to start saying that. I'm like, no, I'm sharing that. It's a bad idea.

Speaker 4:          01:22:03       I saw someone getting mad at someone calling someone stupid because they were saying that's ablest. Do you know what a it is?

Speaker 3:          01:22:12       Ablest. Oh yeah. Because you have your of sound. You're able. You're able to do it. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:22:18       Yeah. Like a. If you are mocking someone who's diminished mentally. Oh, you fucking idiot. That's ablest. Yeah, sure. Which is crazy. Yeah. You're able bodied. Their brain doesn't work so good. You're an ableist if you call them stupid. I mean it's going to get to the point where if you give up certain words, I mean if we keep going like this, it's going to get to the point where we're just gonna have a very hard time communicating effectively. I totally agree. I mean there's. I don't know. There's an. Here's the thing that it is an endless cycle. Yeah. I mean, we just don't have that next unacceptable word, right. You know, like everybody knows. I think a lot of people know that as far as somebody who's a doesn't have is developmentally disabled. Retarded was kind of the Mo. The latest term that was once acceptable is clearly not.

Speaker 4:          01:23:10       Now. That is kind of the point. But before that, you know, moron was a medical term wasn't. Yeah, mongoloid idiot was what they used to call 'em down syndrome children. that was like 100 years ago was on the birth certificate. Right. But I'm saying, you know, people who are saying, you know, just to stop saying return, they're not wrong, but there is also another word down the pipeline, right? There's something else that's coming that's going to be a medical word or term and then that'll be used to insult people, but that's the way people use language. Like once we identify this is the word people use to label someone with a developmental disability, people in the slang will grow from that. People will start using that. Well, what's interesting to me is that when we're talking about words, you're not going to change the way people think.

Speaker 4:          01:24:05       So words are supposed to convey intent. Yes. Supposed to be sounds that we all agree mean a certain thing and the more depth, the more access towards you have, the more you can sort of flavor your conversation. So I uNderstand what you're saying. Like if you're saying this guy, I kind of get it, but you feel like this fucking guy. I'm like, well tom is really mad. You know whaT I mean? That and to take that out. Yeah. it's like, I don't know. So sometimes you take those things out when you're like on a television show or something like that, but all television shows because of that all censored television shows only exists within a certain band. Yes. A certain frequency they'd never get out of that. Like the joey diaz frequency is like, ah, there's no fucking roof. There's no fence. Ah, true. This, this frequency that you get on like late night talk shows or a sitcom, this very narrow band that, that there's no concept in that band.

Speaker 4:          01:25:05       There's no motherfucker this, all those things are not in there, which is what you're all. I feel like whenever you're. For me, when I'm watching something like that, part of my Brain is always like, go find a motherfucker somewhere. You kind of want it. Especially now we're, we're just, we're so used to being free, especially us because a podcast and live, stand up, stand up, you know, and I was gonna bring this up like your show, like your show that you do with your wife, your mom's house. If anybody just wanted to go cherry pick things and write them down. Write some of the things you guys joke around about where you're clearly joking, but take it and write it down in quotes. And then tom said to his wife, oh yeah, and by the way, 100,000 times worse than anything in life stanhope ever said is set on that podcast. I mean, it's not even comparable. It's so much worse. The content. It's like we don't go into the show of like, let's be offensive, but

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       we play in a no rules like have fun environment. You know, it's like free flowing, just say whatever. And that's the fun of the show. Yeah. And it's also everybody knows you're joking. The fan base is like 100 percent on board with this is an uncensored just loose, fun going for it, going for jokes. What I also found too is that during this whole controversy, after your special was released, you got bigger. It's like people, they by doing that campaign and then people who did investigate the guy actually this guy was really fucking funny. I mean I got, I usually, you know, again, I never publicize these things because it's gross, you know, to be like check out this compliment or whatever. But like I got so manY messages from people who are like, I saw this thing on the news because it was on a lot of local news that there's a controversial netflix thing out.

Speaker 3:          01:27:03       People would message me and I saw this thing so I decided to check you out. new fan, just bought tickets to see you at blah blah blah. So I started to get a bunch of messages like that for sure, because you're going to get 30 percent of the people that aren't even going to read it, they're just going to call you piece of shit, but the other people are going to go, what is going on over here? And then next thing you know they're going to investigate and they got to go what? They're doing. This guy dirty. Yeah. Yeah. And then boom, I got a lot of. I got a lot of support that I never. Like I said, I never made light of the fact that people were being supportive, but people were being very supportive. Well, it just seems like there, there's different, there's different rules now for standup and you got to really cover your ass.

Speaker 3:          01:27:42       But in your case you did cover your ass and they disingenuously left that part out. Like they deceptively left that out when they were writing down what you had said. He didn't put it in the context. That's true. And uh, and then, you know, part of you goes a man, like I'm not trying to paint myself as a martyr or you know what I mean, and like people who are going down this path of, you know, they have family or friends with a disability. It's like I'm not gonna my whole thing was never to attack them, so I'm not going to try to make it a battle that I have to win. So once, once I saw like kind of what I thought clearly was happening, I was like, you know, just let people vent their frustration about if it's about me or about what I said, just let it happen.

Speaker 3:          01:28:33       And um, you know, because I don't, I don't hold it against them that they're, that they have that they're upset about this issue, you know? And even though like you're saying your instinct is, is wants to go like, hold on, why don't you put it clearly. RighT. I said, after a moment of it, I realized that that wasn't the point for me in that, in that time I was like, just let people. Because I also figured out that if people, yeah, a lot of people were going to read it, say something and go like, this guy's fucking worst and it's kind of feels good. Sometimes it'd be like, you want to know who the bad guy is, this guy and I, you know, even though you want to be like, hey, I'm not that bad of a guy a. If someone wants to just go there, you just kind of have to let it go and then let the people who were enjoying it or who were investigating it and finding like, oh, it's a little different than it's being presented. Yeah, discovery. That one.

Speaker 2:          01:29:23       There's so many outlets that are looking for outrageous stories. Yeah, that's true. More than ever. And recreational outlet age, recreational outrage. Peddlers or like an an all time high and there's so many people out there that are working. The journalists, the writers they work in for these websites and they got to produce content. Man,

Speaker 3:          01:29:42       I got to tell you, the one of the most amazing discoveries of that process is not the people who got upset at me and would start whatever emailing, saying pam saying things. It was the reporters who would do these news pieces and also not familiar with what they were reporting. They don't care. I don't send that kind of make. I mean doesn't that kind of stand out to you? Like you'Re gonna you're going to do a piece on television that you report to? I don't know how many people. And you're not familiar. You can tell that they had not even watched the clip. Yeah, and they're doing. It wasn't like a, just an anchor reading copy. It was the person doing the piece aBout It. Had no idea what they were talking about. Yeah, they're lazy, super lazy.

Speaker 2:          01:30:29       There's a lot of bad shit out there just to. People just barely just phone it in barely paying attention to what they're doing and then pretending that they're on the moral high ground. Yeah. You got to like. But I think it's kind of a challenge too because it forces me to like really cover all my bases and in these bits. Yeah. Like I did that with the bruce jenner bit from last year. Like I was trying to figure out a way to make fun of this. I'm like, what is the best way to make fun of it? Well, the parallel to my own life that have never been more of a bitch. I've never been happier. But I live with all girls and I'm never been more of a bitch. I just given everything around me all the time. Sure. And that I'm not going out like bruce jenner, that I've never been more of a bitch in my life.

Speaker 2:          01:31:14       But I'm not going out like that is people like, oh, he's always been a man that's really a woman, a woman trapped in a man's body. I'm like, maybe, maybe, or maybe if you live with crazy bitches long enough, you fucking become one maybe. Did you get a lot of for that? You had to get some right? None. I skated through that one as well because i. First of all, I caught it right when people were annoyed. Yeah, right. When people are like, okay, enough of this, like I rode. The timing was really good. Like when it came out, it's like people like enough the fucking articles and she's pretending she's beautiful and she's amazing and stopped. Stopped. What about the fact she killed somebody? What about the ones to. Kyle does. Kyle does a whole bit. Find kyle's bit. It's him at the wheel. It's a. It's caitlin at the wheel. Yeah. And uh, he got recognizing jura bruce brewster to caitlyn gets off free. Play this.

Speaker 5:          01:32:14       I just got my driver's license back, man. Man, bro. Fuck me when he killed that lady with the chicago right now. Carolyn's got a clean record, but I'm a much better driver then broke off. Don't be afraid to hit the streets. Retarded kid. I'm bike.

Speaker 2:          01:32:39       Oh yeah. There you go. Tied everything together. That was the lower one with todd. What's trump? Who's that? With trump in the corner with the girl. Who's that? I be stormy, right?

Speaker 9:          01:32:56       Hi danny. It's stormy. Danielle darby. Why are you calling me here? Because I can't stop thinking about our night. They gather more hard. A nobody but you like nine slash 11 to my athol ground. Zero a meth. But all I know about. I haven't had go. Don't call here again late. I was going to tell you a bang. Make it quick. You have gonorrhea, syphilis and super aids.

Speaker 2:          01:33:36       Face that face that he chose to. It's such a perfect face for trump. Oh my god. Hilarious. Oh my god. Yeah. Oh fuck. Well kudos to netflix for the way they handled it because they just stepped back and just let it. Let it. Let the fucking erase washover. Let the fire go out. I kinda took, I took cues from that after a minute because at first I was like, I should fucking talk to people. And then I kinda was like, I'm just waiting for someone to kilo hooker, someone's gonna to do something to take over in the news. Now I got 20 minutes out of it too. So that word. Oh, that's. There you go. I feel like you have to address something like that. Oh yeah. Why wouldn't do two chapels? Got a bunch of shit. It is new special about some shit that he got in trouble with his old special.

Speaker 2:          01:34:22       I'm hoping it goes, goes this way. It's. I mean, you know the audit. Here's the thing. When I do a show now, the audience is so aware of that stuff. Oh yeah. That it's like, it would be disingenuous for me to not mention it, you know? Yeah. That becomes a thing, right? The more stand up you're doing, the more people know what you're doing and then when something goes sideways, that becomes a bit. Yeah, of course you're feeding off yourself. Yeah, yeah, yeah. that's true. I mean, I just say Louisiana and is like, ah, that's right. The Louisiana, they put. That was the thing. People get mad at you for real pissed off a whole state. A whole state. People were saying that they were saving up bail money. What? I've never even. I know, it's like when I saw that,

Speaker 3:          01:35:09       yeah, they're like, I would see comments like we got to start saving our bail money because we're going to go fuck up thompson girl and then we can bail out. I'm like, you're saving up for that. It's one of the most white trash, fucking amazing, shitty things I've ever heard. So a savings account for bail. what did you do about security after that? Um, I had to take some. They, like I was, it was recommended to me by a whole bunch of industry people to take security precautions in Louisiana. That's it.

Speaker 2:          01:35:39       They're just like, well you sold out like crazy and Louisiana nine months in advance. So you haven't even gotten there yet? No, no. Yeah, iT sold out. We added. Yeah, it's going to be all dudes in the, in the audience going like this. Yeah. I'm like, you're kidding.

Speaker 3:          01:35:57       That money to attack. That'd be hilarious if feel like we paid you to fucking just certain states. Yeah. I've been shitting on Connecticut for years and we've had low back. You're shitting on Connecticut. Gets to meet people come up to me and they're like, I'm talking like in a coffee shop somewhere. Be like, why does joe hey kinetic,

Speaker 2:          01:36:17       I don't really hate Connecticut. One of my best friends lives in Connecticut. Shout out to tommy junior, don't really hate Connecticut. I'm talking shit, you got to understand, and by the way, if you get like real sensitive about your state, it might be a fucking idiot stop. It's a patch of dirt. There's no real estate. There's lines arbitrarily drawn in the sand. You just drive near clock across this line. Now you're in Massachusetts. Does that make any sense to you?

Speaker 3:          01:36:40       Well, no. And the other thing is, you know what helps you see that clearly you've had this. I know I had this for sure is moving. When you move a bunch of times in your life, you're like, oh yeah, like why? Why would you be married in love to that patch of land would never move. They feel like a certain tie to that place and they don't. They're more sensitive. Like I've lived in Ohio, Minnesota, Wisconsin, dc, Maryland, Florida, Massachusetts and California and anytime I've mentioned any one of those places, somebody somewhere has been like, that place fucking sucks. I'm like, okay, sure. Go ahead. But like your birthplace, sex, fine. I don't care man. It's just a place that I was squeezed out of someone's vagina. I don't care. Yeah, you moved around a lot. You get it. Yeah. It's like, why would you be so like people take it like you're insulting their family, you know, it is my family. No, it's not. do you know where they, the nuttiest about it? Texas main. Oh really? They call them maniacs. Really? Yup.

Speaker 2:          01:37:44       I was doing gigs up in Maine and I was shitting on main and this guy was this old guy literally got up and he was blood in his eyes coming towards the stage screaming at me. Yeah. I had this whole bit

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       about how if you get pulled over that I got a speeding ticket when I was driving because it's like there's this long stretch from portland and bangor. It's like an hour drive where there's nothing on the road. And I go, I got a speeding ticket because they just, you know, you can't help yourself. I go, but you got to figure like the cops from Maine, you should be able to trick them. And I had this whole bit about trick the cop really fucking stupid copy, throw a potato out the window with the potato go. That's a pretty good one, nice and round and the guy drives off and while I'm in the middle of doing this, guy jumps up and he's screaming, just screaming at me, fuck you. Fucking main is the best package date. You're a piece of shit, and he's really, really mad at me and I couldn't believe it.

Speaker 4:          01:38:39       I was like, do you really mad? And someone's making fun of Maine. he's going to be mad, but I always think someone's got to be mad about something else. Right. That's their turf. They're defending their turf. That's right. Yeah. That's their spot. Yeah. They call them maniacs. Yeah. They get really, really, really angry. It's funny people, but people who have audiences will like, if you like you, people are nuts. If you're like, you're crazy people. They're like, that's cool. I like that. It was certain places like Texas is Texas. Yeah. I have a bit that I opened with in Texas all the time about this one spot in Texas. It's like it's. It defines Texas pete, like you ever seen. You know what a buckeys is? [inaudible]? No. Yeah. This whole bit about buckets, not like a gas station, kind of. It's like a gas station.

Speaker 4:          01:39:23       If you created a gas station while you were in the middle of a cocaine binge and someone said, dude, I want you to make me the ultimate guide. That's true. That's true. It's fucking crazy pLace, but it's so light and when you bring it up to texans, they get all excited. They get excited. Yes. It's like, yeah, this is something that defined. That's a buckeys later that lose size of that place doesn't even make sense. No, that's 100 pumps. Easy. Yeah. You get 100 people pulling over for gas. That's crazy. I mean, they're just all prepped for the end of the world. There are stretches. This is how dumb I am of a I 10 in Texas that you will hit maybe like 75 miles without gas and you tempt fate, you know, if you're driving, that's not good. No, and twice I've been like, eh, I'll get it. The next one. And almost been just fumes. You know, somebody did it in a tesla, died out. he died out of out driving with a tesla.

Speaker 4:          01:40:22       Good luck. Some farmer pulls over seas. You have your shitty electric scooter. doesn't want to work anymore. I read the elon musk is sleeping on the floor of the tesla factory. They said he's sleeping on the floor of the tesla factory where they're trying to get production ready. Uhm, and that tesla's finally going to leave this eli musk is stressed. oh son of a bitch. Elon musk is stressed. Says he's sleeping on the tesla factory floor and has no time to go home and shower. Wow. That guy's an animal. He really is. Has there ever been a guy who does more shit? Benjamin franklin? Nah, but asshole with a kite and key. Fuck, that guy wouldn't teeth. Now what he's done, think of is he's in the middle of making this boring company that bores holes under the ground and then they'll have the high speed train speed train.

Speaker 4:          01:41:18       Yeah. He's in the middle of the hyperloop. He's in the middle of space x. He's in the middle of tesla production. They got approved for those satellites to go in the space for the internet that didn't hear about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. At least can provide worldwide internet. Right? That's the idea. Yeah, dude. Yeah. It says, how does one has one guy able to do so much? It's a better. Now the crazy thing. I was saying the other day, he's so smart that people just let them drill under the ground in la. They're like, yeah, go ahead. Go ahead man. Nobody else like, who the fuck would let anybody just drill into the ground? Who do you. Where do you, what office do you walk into with that presentation? You know, it's like people, it's like a six month thing to build a fence in la. He was like, nice to go down a bunch like way far and then make trains.

Speaker 4:          01:42:10       They would never listened to him if he was like a regular person know or even regular genius. Like you almost have to be like elon musk. He's like our. It's like a guy and tips. He's like our guy, you know, elon musk, plan for high speed car tunnel, gets initial approvals from la. I would like to see the documentary about the presentation. I'd like to see what happens when the earthquake kits and that thing fills up with water rushing towards you and you're on that scooter. God damn. Two point seven mile proof of concept puddle along alongside polenta.

Speaker 4:          01:42:45       Damn. Zero missions. High speed underground alternative means of transit for personal vehicles and slash or single rider use according to urbanize which reported on the approval man. I mean, what, what, what motivates a guy like that to do so many different things. That's what's so confusing. It's, it's, it's, um, it really is that real curious. He's an engineer at heart and it's that. See, I think it's the curiosity and, uh, of, of the challenge and accomplishing something that hasn't been done before and I want to make it possible. I feel like that has to be the real drive. It can't be the money and the, the, the stardom of it. I feel like he really gets off on how can I find a solution to this thing? Yeah, well they're all technologically based things. Everything he's doing is like tesla, the tesla, those home units, the tiles, the solar tiles that he's putting on people's roofs and also it all ties into better for humanity. Yeah. Yeah. It was amazing. Yeah, he's an, he's an incredibly lucky that we got a guy like that. I mean he's, he's essentially like our version

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       of a tesla. Nikola tesla guy just keeps coming up with new crazier shit to just. It's amazing. there's only one of those guys though. That's crazy. Of course. The other ones like you would think there'd be a bunch of those kind of guys now he's. Yeah. What if he wasn't born? You know what I mean? Like when, when you have a guy who's that much of an outlier, it's just so it's so strange because you're forced to consider like how, how is kind of creePy and a nation of 300, 20 million people, that one individual be such an outlier, but even I would even outside of that, there's not even someone like really liked him somewhere else. So it's really like, no, like 7 billion people. Yeah. Yeah. Who is, who is the one person that you think of when it comes to technological innovation and and producing crazy new inventions and using them to the public of jobs like that.

Speaker 2:          01:44:49       Right. I mean it Was sorta, sorta. He didn't do it the way that this guy does know. He was just within my company is new shit you're going to want. Yeah. That was really him. It's crazy. You see so much. So many people talking shit about apple lately, but their laptops, people are just tired of. I'm tired of the lack of innovation. It's just all the same thing. All the mac books look the same but by a windows laptop you by infinite variety, bunch of different types and styles and macbook air. Thirteen inch or 15 inch macbook pro was considered kind of a dud I think, and I know that sucks. Home pod didn't sell well. They thought that it was going to be a big thing. Well that's the thing where it's like you only have so much momentum. That's by jobs and then the new guy tim cook has to takeover and he's got to figure out a way to keep that thing rolling and it's just, he's not the same guy.

Speaker 2:          01:45:42       it seems like way healthier. Right, right. He's not, I mean healthier, not just physically, but mentally. He's not. He's not obsessed, man, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Because jobs was obsessed. You need to be obsessed to be that guy. Yeah. I mean, it's probably one of the things that made them sick. what was your take on it and you know, you've probably already talked about it, so sorry if you did, but uh, with that whole connor in New York thing pretty fucking crazy. Um, there's a whole story behind it. And the story behind it is that artem low bob, who is one of connor stablemates, had an issue with khabib number go madoff because he said something in an interview that could be pulled out of fights and the conners, the real real fighter, and then khabib's a coward, so could be found him and kind of smacked him a little. Said you'd call me a coward, motherfucker like that kind of shit, and there's a video of him saying it to them, talking to them in russian and connor saw that video and flew from Ireland with a bunch of fucking gangsters all the way to New York to crazy. Yeah. There might've been some substances involved.

Speaker 2:          01:46:56       Not good though. No. I mean he might. He literally might wind up wind up in jail. It's entirely possible that new york's going to prosecute him. I mean that was like a salt. he threw a dolly at a car. People get their eyes cut their face cut. Glass shatter, right? Yeah. Yeah. And luckily it wasn't. I mean, I don't want to Say it any better that men get cut, but imagine if he did it to rose. Nama. Eunice, she's beautiful little 24 year old girl who's a world champion would have. she got cut by the glass. What if he ruined her career? Like what if she never got to fight again with the glass? Cut her eye and we lost rose and that would've been the day of or day before a fight. Before a fight. She, she thought about pulling out of the fight.

Speaker 2:          01:47:37       She was so distraught by the whole event that she really pulling out. Yeah, because she was on that bus. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. definitely not going to get them. I guess I don't know it, but then in a way it does. I know there's people who are talking about, oh, this is all coordinated planned like teams on your rent press thing. Yeah. I mean you can definitely see how, how it could be. It's not. It doesn't, but I mean, yeah, it's just not. But it. It's not gonna is it gonna lower his draw. Probably gonna. He's gonna be even bigger than ever. That's what I'm saying. So when he actually does fight khabib, if those to do fight, if let's say,

Speaker 2:          01:48:17       let's say they solve everything civilly, meaning connor pays everybody off, pays off, pays ray borg off. Pays off emotional duress to anyone who sues him. That was on the bus. PaY some sort of a fine to the state of New York. That'S pretty significant. Gives up a few million dollars for sure. Right? Then they put the fight together. It's going to be giant. It's going to be giant. Maybe that would be the rule. Conor mcgregor's comeback fight as already being mooted as. What does that mean as the biggest record breaker in ufc history? I've never seen that word. Mu did. Have you ever seen it? I think it means touted it, but never seen it either. The biggest record breaker in ufc history. Yeah. I will be. If he fights khabib. Experts are predicting. He'll be back in the octagon within a year. Okay. I'd say a year from now, that's not a like a much of a stretch.

Speaker 2:          01:49:15       That's a crazy prediction of six to 12 months to. I just saw and maybe 81,000 seat stadium in moscow. That's what they're gonna do potentially. I mean it's not signed obviously, but that's what this article is going to be right here. Watching right here, watching that shit on that tv. It's going to be awesome. We're going to be in american on american soil drinking, budweiser, drinking american beer. Maybe some sam adams, so I'm american. I'm not going to. Russia not going. Come to me and Russia cut to you in Russia. Got to, you mean the ufc? They sit down and get me excited about it. And how many hours is the flight? Shit? It's a long flight. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:49:57       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:49:58       It just seems like a. do a show there? Nope. No, I really want to stay here. Really? Yeah. I don't, I don't. The, the beat up that you get from international travel. Yeah. It's not worth it and quite honestly I like doing fight companions as much or more than I like actually being at the fights. Really? Oh yeah. It's the most fun ever. when me and brendan and eddie and brian get together and just talk shit and get high and start drinking wine and just getting silly. Sometimes we barely comment on the fights. It's just like being silly. he's having a good time. Eddie have some new conspiracy theory about whatever and eddie will go off and want to hear that new dinosaurs not being real or there's always something. I mean he just never gives up. He loves him the fuck. I mean, he left and then every now and then there's something that comes out that sort of confirms it.

Speaker 2:          01:50:52       Like, did you see that sinclair broadcasting network compilation? Yes. Which shows all the different anchors, same exact same thing, and you realize, oh, they were given a script all across the country. All these local news places. We're giving a script to try to chastise fake news and say we have to be careful about fake news. Yeah. Yeah. It's fascinating. It's weird. [inaudible] and they're growing. They're growing. Sinclair's growing a lot. Yeah, they have. There's know studies show to that. I guess one of the biggest opinion formers still a that people kind of write off because it's not as sexy and big as local news. Local news is huge at at forming opinions, which I believe it. Yeah, I believe it. It's. It's so fascinating to me. And then this facebook thing is fascinating to me too, because we were talking about facebook yesterday that what we were watching this, you know, when he was being grilled zuckerberg.

Speaker 2:          01:51:47       Yeah. One of the things they were talking about his upcoming elections internationally. He's talking about how facebook has really, you know, we have to concentrate and all these upcoming elections and make sure there's no bad actors that are like what? Like facebook is involved in shaping the world. It'S incredible. Yeah. I, you see, I saw an article about how they said that these senators that grilled him miss so many things, basically because they're old, they're just like, they didn't ask so many questions because they don't understand how facebook works. There's a funny video that I put up, jamie, you find it, it's on twitter of some of the more hilarious things that came out of that interaction and one of them was the guy asks a zuckerberg, would you tell us the hotel you're staying at? He's like, no, like, would you be willing to tell us and show us all the messages, all the that you've sent? And he's like, no, like, listen to this.

Speaker 1:          01:52:49       I'Ll get to that part,

Speaker 2:          01:52:56       those, this,

Speaker 11:         01:52:58       uh,

Speaker 2:          01:52:59       back up, back it up.

Speaker 12:         01:53:00       That's nine fertilizer or campaign, uh, who, who asks for it? Mr zuckerberg, would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?

Speaker 11:         01:53:15       Uh, no.

Speaker 12:         01:53:20       If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the names of the people you've messaged?

Speaker 2:          01:53:26       Senator? No, I would probably not choose to do that publicly here. I think

Speaker 12:         01:53:30       maybe what this is all about,

Speaker 5:          01:53:32       here's what everybody's been trying to tell you. That, and I, I say this gently, your user agreement shocks. I'm going to suggest to you that you go back home and rewrite it until you're $1,200 an hour lawyers. No disrespect, they're good, but, but tell hIm you want it written in english and swahili so the average american can understand that would be a start quite a story, right?

Speaker 2:          01:54:08       There's no competition. That's what's really weird. Yeah. Like as far as like, there's twitter. Yeah, that is just, it's cool that we have these three different ones too, which is really fascinating. You got twitter, which is just some text, like I saw this article, check it out and then people retweet it. I liked that aspect of the product. And then, you know, you could state your opinion on things, you could clarify things, but then there is instagram, just photos, hey, this is my time in Peru, look at the beautiful buildings. They own that one, that's not a competitor. Right. But I mean the three different things. And then there's facebook, which is like a lot of arguments in discussions, deep discussion, politics. That's like the big one when it comes to like deep political discussions.

Speaker 2:          01:54:57       It's a wonder what is coming next because these we typically people try to my goals, I know you're right. But I feel like, I don't know, they have a, they have a pretty strong grip. I mean, you know, snapchat is really popular, but as soon as snapchat looked like it was about to just really explode an meaning that it would be the kind of premier, you know, a visual one. Instagram was like, we're going to add that that same, uh, aspect to instagram, instagram stories just squashed that squashed. Instagram's a better platform. But it's just really interesting to see like what we choose to put our time and our energy and where it's going. And when Is the first virtual reality or augmented reality, social network going to what's got to be around the corner? They must be scrambling to be the first to come up with it.

Speaker 2:          01:55:52       Because if you can like if you tried, there was a thing called views. There still is a Thing called views. I got on it. I told them once people get on it, I haven't even opened it and fucking month if you put a cup v use, I put a couple pictures up and then I was like, I gave up. I mean I signed up for it but I can't do another one right now. I just can't see. I don't even know what it's called. The, I forgot his fucking name. Nobody's on that goddamn thing. But it was also confusing, like no one could comment on my pictures and less like accepted them. And then I looked at thirtY 5,000 people to accept. I'm not doing that. I gotta do one by one. I don't know. It seemed like it. Put them in groups. Oh come all the way off.

Speaker 2:          01:56:34       Fuck off with that gap all the way. Fuck outta here wIth that. Am I going to do that? How am I going to do that with 35,000 people? IT might even be more than that now. I don't even know how many I have now. tell me how many I have. I haven't been there in forever. I don't even know the name of it. Kona views veered so far off. Google views. It's hard to figure out how to look to. What's Your. Have a favorite one? You have a favorite platform or like instagram added to it seems to be the, the most. Uh, It's the, it's the most flexible. You can put text up, you can put an image of text, you can put a video up. It's great. You know, I think it's the most flexible. You're fucking instagram makes me hungry. Yeah. Do you cook?

Speaker 2:          01:57:19       I do not got some milk. I just got some new sausages. It's very easy. Easy to cook. Elk sausage. I have some. Oh yeah. Tommy? Yes. Fuck yeah, there's some here. Yes, I do. Oh, can I take some reserve? Oh shit. Oh, it does hurt stocks. Doxil I. This is a good year. Good year for the rogan meet. Collecting from. Yeah. I got to elk this year, so that's like 800 pounds of meat. I've already given away a couple of hundred pounds. Really? Yeah, I'd give it away for everybody. That's awesome. I love it. I feel like I'm a provider. Yeah, you are like give it to people and then they send me pictures of food. They cooked. I'm like, you're the village elder man. You're fucking. Duncan sent me a picture of these meatballs and he made with the elk, with the ground elk. I waS like, oh my god, that looks so good.

Speaker 2:          01:58:01       That was crazy. Duncan obviously. Very good. I saw him last night. Yeah, last night. He's here. Yeah, he's back. He's back. move back. He's great man. He's such a good dude. He is a sweetheart. We did brooklyn together. Me, him and ari. Oh really? I didn't. Yeah, it was fun, man. And then we went to peter luger's. I saw the Peter Lynch. Oh fuck. Yeah. You know, they put those. I think it's the second part of it. They have like a process there that they put in at 1200 degree broiler, so like that's why it pops. This shits that. By the way, I think obviously peter luger does it right. To me it's one of the only. I'm not somebody that

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       complains at restaurants.

Speaker 13:         01:58:44       Yeah, come on. Yeah, I was camp. It was a beautiful. Those are beautiful. You don't get that over a plate of carrots. I don't. I like fuck it. I can

Speaker 4:          01:59:00       meet piping hot. I can't do luke warm, you know, it's like I'll, I'll tell them, can you make it hotter? And they're like, you want hot sauce? And I'm like, no, no, no. And you put it back on fire so that it's hot when I eat it. That's the only way you like it. I like meat. I like it. Particularly steak, like temperature wise, very high. I don't like it cooked through, but I liked it like on a hot plate or just like off the grill in my mouth. That's interesting because some people think that you should let it rest. I know letting it rest before you. I mean, you know, taking, letting them eat rest before you grill it and. No, no. Letting it rest after your grill. It supposed to let it rest for 10 minutes now. Fuck that. No way. No.

Speaker 4:          01:59:46       Yeah, there's all sorts of weird rules. What you're supposed to do and not supposed to do with meat. I watched the whole steg documentary. Which one? I think it might be called steak or was it just followed like all over the world. Different people who either are chefs or raise cattle and, and you know, theories on how to make that. This might be it here. Yeah. This is it. I watched this. Is it good? It was a production wise is a little [inaudible] but we will do shit different ways. Yeah, I mean, but it's, it's entertaining and you know, seeing how they make it different in different parts of the world was cool. You could go down a rabbit hole when it comes to food preparation. Oh yeah. You know, like anthony bourdain show, no reservations got me into it and now his new show parts unknown is fucking amazing for that.

Speaker 4:          02:00:36       Yeah. Just traveling everywhere and eating exotic food everywhere. It's great. I love bordain. You know, he's all skinny now. Have you seen him? Yeah, he looks carves out. Did he cut out the booze? Cut out the car. He has that naturally thin frame to never was really like a big, big guy. Now he does jujitsu every day. He's shredded to izzy. It's got a six pack full on six pack. He used to have a pot belly. Good for you, ant? Yeah, that's nice man. Pimping pimping. He used to like, used to have like a pot belly just eating. He told me that he got on statens which are um, those uh, cholesterol blockers, you know, he got on those instead of not, instead of changing his diet, just like, fuck it, I'm just gonna get on the statens. I'm just gonna keep you may. His whole show was just. I mean, I'd like to, for him to do an episode just on diarrhea and where he's headed and what the worst one was because I'm sure he's got some epic stories. Almost shit my pants last night at the improv. Really? Yup. I came so close, same in my car, I'm on my way to the improv. I was coming over the hill and I was on laurel and I was like, oh my god, I'm

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       several miles away and I'm not going to make it real and I was going to try to get into the mcdonald's on sunset and take a shit there. And I was like, if I just get into that mcdonald, but then I'm like, I'm gonna have to buy something because this is all a lot of homeless people in that area. You can't just use the bathroom, you have to be a customer. I kind of have the time and I'm like, I'm just going to keep it together. And it was just sweating, willpower alone that I didn't shit myself. It was an internal wrestling. Did you park in front or did you parked right in front and I ran into the bathroom and I got to the toilet, got my pants down, put my butt and then my shit so hard. I lifted like, yeah, it's like one of those jet things with the dudes and the ocean and the water.

Speaker 2:          02:02:25       The jets like got him up in the air, a jet pack, like drag racing when the foot hit the gas money cars front. Oh, I barely made it and I miss my spot. Were you scared someone was going to be on the toilet? Did mr highspot? Yeah, nikki glaser. I'd take my spot when I went after. What did beforehand? Nothing unusual. It's just, it didn't make any sense. I don't know what it was. I don't know what got me, but something got me and it got and it was like, it was like on the way, on the way over the hill. I was like, oh no, like I'm not gonna make it. And I was, I was, you know, you start thinking of different places you could pull over to shit. Like maybe if I just jumped in this guy's bushes, like maybe I was trying to think of places where I could. Shit. That's how bad acadian. Yeah, on laurel worse.

Speaker 2:          02:03:15       I was thinking of pulling over on a side street and just shitting in some bushes. It's just the cleanup it because yesterday I'm thinking now because I know now I know this is a possibility. I didn't shit myself, but I came close close. I need an extra pair of underwear and pants in my car at all times. Yeah. It's a small package. Pair of pants or underwear. Maybe not totally paper to maybe. Maybe it goes, goes low. Where was callin going when he said he shit himself? Didn't. He didn't. He said he did and then he showed up and I'm like, what happened? Oh, it changed. My parents were like, what? You just changed your payment? Changes their pants. Just change your pants. Do you just pull it? Where'd you change your pants? Where? Where'd you go with your shitty pants? Did you go to a gas station?

Speaker 2:          02:03:59       What the fuck are you talking about, calvin? Yeah. No, he was supposed to be doing a spot at the ice house. That god can't make it a shit mY pants. Like your people waiting for you here. Get over here. Twenty minutes later he's there. No shit. Fresh pAnts, son of a bitch. I hate shooting at clubs. You got to do what you gotta do though. Of course. I know I'm saying that. I mean I've done it. Yeah. He shouldn't have planes too and I fucking sometimes god dammit. Yeah. Planes are the worst when you go in there after someone shit and all that smear as over the log smear over the inside of that bowl. That's a very ineffective way of containing odor and cleaning the. I've seen it. I've

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       walked into a plane bathroom like get. Oh my god. You lift up the seat and it's stuck to the side and put like a chunk. Oh, log. Yeah. And then you hit flush and you see the water go over it. Just like not moving it at all. You got to pee on it and knock it loose and sometimes you don't even have enough strength for that. I've, I've told the flight attendants and someone really dropped a crazy shit in there. They gave me spray like from their personal, like go spray that in there myself. It's not going to shake it loose off the side. No, it's a clear. Yeah. It's intense. Intense man. Yeah. Why is, why is your body have to smell so awful, like wouldn't know. What purpose does that serve, I guess to let you know that that is not something you want to put in your body.

Speaker 3:          02:05:24       You don't want to eat that, you know, because otherwise, like I told you about my dog when he was a puppy, he would eat his shit. He wants you to show up so bad that as he was shitty, he will be turning around and trying to bite it out of his apple. Oh my god. Really? This little golden retriever. Wow. Was when he was a little baby. He would do that. It was hilarious and disgusting at the same time, but he'd be like shitting and they'd go, oh, what do we got here? And then they apparently they, they, they such a common thing with dogs. There's something to give them, you know, to, to keep, to make their shit tastes like, oh, it's not a terrible enough on this shit isn't. And they're like, no, this will really make it bad. I'm like, oh, okay.

Speaker 3:          02:06:02       Yeah. Some people spray something on the shit. I'm like, why don't you just clean it up? You lazy bitch can just claim it. Hang up the phone. I'm just going to spray something. We'll spray some hot sauce. Teach a little fellow. Wasn't, you know, I watched this thing on spies and they used to, uh, they used to leave notes like, this is back in the cold war, days in dead animals. And like that would be one way to pass on information, but those animals would get eaten by other animals because it's dead, right? So then they, they figured out that nothing. No wild animal basically likes tabasco. So they would douse dead animals with tabasco and have a note. Wow. Tucked into it. Never get eaten. They would smell that and be like, fuck that. Isn't that crazy? You'd be like, hmm. That was pretty good. This might be doable.

Speaker 3:          02:06:57       Now, when I was in new orleans, they have hot chicken, fried chicken dipped in hot sauce. Yeah. I think in nashville has a nashville, new orleans, nashville, the nashville hot chicken is confused it. Yeah, I confused it. It's nashville. It was fucking amazing. Amazing, right? Yeah. Yeah. There's a big one here I think downtown. Yep. What is it not ready? Just one North Carolina. Was that one of those ones? You have to wait in line all day. But that's the nashville one too, which makes me. I'm like, fuck this, I only make a certain amount of day. Yeah. So they don't like, they're not cooking it all day. They make one batch and that's how much you get. Let that kind of demand for your, like a made this and they're like, we'll

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       wait outside in the sun. Please. Can I have some like I'm out, I'm leaving, I'm leaving for the day. I'll see you. The franklins and austin franklin's barbecue. Famous for that. They people pay people to wait in line for them and here. Um, I mean I've driven by it. I mean for years. What's it called? On the brayer. Pinks. Yeah. You see that line sometimes you're like, that's just a regular hot dog to get mad once you eat it. Yeah, of course. I'm a fucking moron. And in philly, almost all the good cheese steak places have a crazy line. Well there's something about booze. And then food that's cooked out in the open, you're like, ah, that, that smell fly around the. The night air. Yeah. Yeah. The last time I drank a of substance, I think it was in columbus, and they have a carts, street carts guys making, you know, uh, euros and hot dogs.

Speaker 4:          02:08:27       And like, you have a little booze and you, you tear it down and you're like, that was good. Round two, let's do it. And then it's like 10 minutes after you eat your second thing when you're drinking, you're like, this was a bad idea. I should have just stuck to the one we were in columbus once and we went to a bar after we did the comedy show and there was a guy in front of the bar that was selling venison sausage sandwiches with peppers and onions and whole lease shit. Was it good? I felt like the first time I'd ever eaten a venison sausage, but this guy killed the deer himself. Was selling venison sausages. Had a cart and the cart. Yeah. That's the coolest fucking amazing. And all kinds of crazy sauces that he was putting on him as an artist. I think about that.

Speaker 4:          02:09:13       That's an artist. Just I hope one day I walk out. There he is. There he is. Yeah. The venison sausage guy. I got some elk sausage for you telling me about them. I can't wait. I can't. Let's wrap this up because I gotta get outta here. I gotta drive all the way to fucking irvine tonight. I was gonna ask you if tom could tell you about the cursive little b. He knows all about it. Yeah. I think you know more about the curse of little b. Little b. He really did curse Kevin Duran, right? He did carson and it works. Kevin wants. No, no part of that. Wow. I mean, not even apologize now, but kevin switched teams because of the curse. Who knows? He said he was never going to win a championship ever again or ever. Really. I think that's what he said. And then he took the curse off, I believe.

Speaker 4:          02:09:56       Yeah. I think you're right. These people. But it didn't occur as harden because took his uh, then credited from it. I believe his wife movement, I don't know if it was like cooking, like I got to eat whatever, starting food up. I'm eating right now. You're like, when you're, when you're killing it and like that was a little bees move so nobody lifted. It looks like you lift at sea lifts. Curse and james harden. Chris, multiple people on twitter. It's a thing you don't want. That's when it happened. I took, I texted you and I was like, oh see when the thing was when, when a guy like that says he's cursing and that's what [inaudible] all about. It gets in your head. That's right. Mind fucks you.

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       What does he dress like? Dress like that? Yes. He just like a chick with a, like an old lady's hat and a dress on. He's definitely had a wide variety of outfits. Fascinating. Fascinating. He wants to do a podcast. Oh, you should do it. It does. God, he's going to come in. Base. Guys are going to come down here. Yep. We're gonna. Keep popping feet and face photo. Send them in feet and face. Yeah. That's what he wants. One of his themes. Yeah. He wants girls feet and their face showed me your face too. I'll be going to show your feet. Yeah, because it can't be busted. Well like. Yeah. What if you have a nice fee and your face is on the other thing. Yeah. The other way around. You keep your socks on if you're hot, funky feet. Right? No one wants to see that shit. He is a serious character though.

Speaker 2:          02:11:17       Yeah man. He's an interesting guy. Interesting guy. He's probably the first guy to come with the public curse. Like who? Who else? Who's publicly curse people, I dunno. And it's worked. That's what's crazy is this is bold. Just to have that in your arsenal of I'm saying of of insults or beef, like to be the first like if somebody was. Somebody said like, joe, this dude was talking shit about you and you're like, that's fine. I just cursed that motherfucker. Like that in and of itself is just terrifying. Yeah.
