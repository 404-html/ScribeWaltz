Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Ladies and gentlemen, man, the Internet is a fucking crazy plays. I need some positive uh, positive stuff cause I fucked up today, this morning, got up this morning to my usual stuff, checked my email, handled some business. Uh, it was sitting there drinking a little Kombucha and I read my message board and uh, I read this plan parenthood thread. I'm just tweeting and um, I read about Dee, I don't know if you guys know what's going on. The uh, planned parenthood was they were accused of selling fetuses and actually not just selling fetuses but making deals to deliver more intact fetuses and talking about um, the body parts as a, as line items. And I was like, well, come on, that can't be real. So a, call me, Pete is the gentleman who put it up on the website on the message board. If you're having a problem, join that message board.

Speaker 1:          00:01:11       By the way. We switched hosts and there was just a giant fuck up along the way. And along the way, there was some fun around 13,000 spam accounts signed up. They were just fake, like a bunch of numbers, like six, seven, eight nine 10, six seven eight nine 10 11, six, seven eight nine 10 11, 12 like that kind of shit like a bunch of them. So we have to figure out a way to filter that stuff out. But we'll, we'll let people in soon anyway, the video, uh, if you want to search for the video, the video on youtube, if you really want to watch it, it's intact. Fetuses in quotes, just a matter of line items for planned parenthood. So I watch it and the video's disturbing. First of all, it's disturbing the way this woman is talking about fetuses and you know, it's, it's Kinda creepy the way she's talking about the, uh, there's buyers that want these specimens and their, I guess their for medical tasks or for scientific tests, it's hard to, it's hard to sit through the whole thing and then they get deep into video and that's where it gets really fucking disturbing because the people that are buying ask if they can see some of the product or some of the samples I think is the word they used.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       So the woman says, well from the abortion say they're all just in like a big pile and they say, well, it's okay. We just, you know, we would like to go see him. So they go to this pile and um, they start picking things out with tweezers including fully intact arms with hands, like a little baby arm that's maybe, you know, an inch and a half long, two inches long with fingers and um, you know, they're talking about it just like you would talk about like how you grow tomatoes. Like, well, if you get tomatoes that are like six weeks old, they look like that. If you get them to their 12 weeks old to get more, more parts, dude, it's fucking really disturbing because they're pulling these things out with tweezers. Oh, this is a lung. Oh, was that, can he, can he see the Thalamus? Well, it's hard to tell him this big pile.

Speaker 1:          00:03:22       It's a pile of parts man. And it, it, first of all, if you've ever had an abortion and you know someone's had an abortion, we've had a girlfriend or you personally, um, you don't think about what exactly is going on there. But when you look at this pile of these parts, you're forced to recognize exactly what it is and then you forced to wonder what's going on through the minds of these people that are just talking about them and referring to them in quotes. Just a matter of line items. And this is fucking pile of baby parts that they sucked out of a woman's body or a bunch of women's bodies. It's disturbing.

Speaker 2:          00:04:07       I, uh, I remember seeing this video because they, it was made for a recent bill or something like that in Congress that, that, uh, the antiabortion people put as a shock video. I scare video and I thought it was fully debunked. Uh, I didn't know that that was actual real thing. I was at Philly debunked. Um, I guess the video makes it show it was supposed to be one of those like Gotcha videos, uh, where it's, it's, it's mixing lies with like real stuff that they actually do in the video. And, uh, I thought for sure it was debunked, but maybe I was wrong. I didn't really look into it too much, but I don't remember.

Speaker 1:          00:04:46       It was debunked. Um, and you can figure out a way to pull up a link that says us debunk what planned parenthood hoax really proves right wing extremis have no qualms about destroying people's lives. And when does this come out?

Speaker 2:          00:04:59       Uh, this came out July 16th. Um Hm.

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       This is that salon.com though, by the way, which is an insanely left wing side. Yeah. Um, so let's just Google it just to see. Planned parenthood video.

Speaker 2:          00:05:13       White House says planned parenthood videos are fake. Well, what's fake? Yeah. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:05:18       I mean, it's not the real people. Um, okay. New Planned parenthood video, baby parts buyer jokes about shipping severed heads two hours ago from the weekly standard. This is a new video, the latest undercover planned parenthood videos and interview with Kate Dyer, CEO of an organization called stem express that buys a boarded baby parts for planned parenthood and sells them to researchers. There are no graphic images in this video, but DIYers, comments about shipping the severed intact. Uh, I don't know what that word is. Cow calve. Cal-Vet for calvarium. Calvarial hmm. Calvarium calvarium or skull of an aborted baby. Uh, our bone chilling stem express, they say, uh, I know we get requests for neural tissue. Uh, it's the hardest thing in the world to ship. The buyer says, uh, you do it as a whole. Calvarial I guess that's the whole head and stem expresses. Yeah, that's it.

Speaker 1:          00:06:26       Yeah. That's the easiest way. And I mean, we've actually had good success with that in the past. Buyer says, yeah, make sure the eyes are closed. And then stem express loud, laughter, tell the lab it's coming so they don't open the box and go, Oh God, laughter. So yeah. Whereas so many of the academic labs cannot fly like that. They're just not capable. Buyer says, why is that? I don't understand that stem express as, it's almost like they don't want to know where it comes from. I can see that where they're like in quotes, we need limbs but no hands and feet need to be attached. We want to take it all off, like in quotes, make it so that we don't know what it is. Okay. This is, um, I don't know what his debunked and what's not be bunked about that because it seems like in the conversation, I mean, look, when they're digging through that bag of baby parts, which was the most disturbing part of it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:24       Um, look, if people are going to get abortions, I personally do not have a problem with them taking the aborted fetal tissue and using it for scientific experiments. Because the aborted fetal tissue already exists. They're already having abortions and if abortions are legal, shouldn't there be something done with that aborted fetal tissue that may be beneficial to humanity? Shouldn't there be a way that they can experiment? I mean it's not like they're asking people to get abortions that would normally have kept the baby and loved them and brought them to adulthood. They're there, they're going to have the abortions. So if they are going to have the abortions, is it such a bad thing to use that fetal tissue for scientific experimentation? That's not the, the disturbing part about it disturbing part about is the visual aspect of seeing the

Speaker 2:          00:08:14       yeah, the body position. You shouldn't see that is what pretty much sad. But you know what, what this article on the Huffington post is saying is that what they did is they took shocking video of, you know, borsch things, which is going to be disgusting anyways. And they're saying that planned parenthood's making all this money off of selling all the parts to, you know, in, in what planned parenthood is saying is no, we just donate it to the, to, to science and, and, and, and people that want to use it for medical research. So that's not what was going on

Speaker 1:          00:08:44       video. And the video, the woman was talking about the amount of money that they would get doing it and it was thousands of dollars a week.

Speaker 2:          00:08:50       And that's why they see this. They're saying that's a hoax. And they're saying that the, what you're watching

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       wasn't what the audio was. And uh, wait a minute, that doesn't make any sense cause you see the woman's say it, that group behind the videos is facing at least two lawsuits because it's fake. Is it an huff post? Huff Post. Let's see here is on CNN. And what does CNN saying? They're saying it's a hoax too. Yeah. There's a company created to go against the left wing. I oversee a group called acorn. And, uh, throughout this article, it also says

Speaker 1:          00:09:22       the Acorn is the same company that they were, uh, they were accused of, they were trying, people were trying to get funds for creating prostitutes or for a, for pimping member. Remember that whole thing where there was a, a bunch of people that are trying to get funds.

Speaker 3:          00:09:39       The first part here, it says there's a fake company set up called biomax procurement services and that was the hoax. And then according to this is the hoaxers website was a 30 month long investigative journalism study by the center of Medical Progress documenting how planned parenthood it sells body parts for board at babies. Right. Um, that's not true. That's not true. They don't sell them. It's flat out untrue.

Speaker 1:          00:10:01       So, well what was the woman in the thing she was talking about body, right

Speaker 3:          00:10:06       radio. They were baiting them into conversations about others, about sales selling stuff. It says that it really don't do that. They were just trying to get them to say it kind of

Speaker 1:          00:10:15       did get him to say it. So what is the deal? She was talking about the bottom line about how much money they could make and how much money she could add to the, so was she like a rogue lady for planned parenthood?

Speaker 3:          00:10:25       That's what they're saying. And they're also saying that like, you know what I mean? This bill that was passing was going to cut off all funding to planned parenthood. So this was like a full on attack trying to get rid of planned parenthood by anti-abortionists.

Speaker 1:          00:10:36       Jeremy, scroll back down. We went back where you were again. Um, the details of the processes are enough to trouble anyone nonmedical people don't talk about the price of requesting, removing or shipping Oregon's pieces of flesh for the from place to place. Most of us would freak out if we listened to professionals and the local hospital, funeral home or medical examiners office discuss details about how a dying person's request to have their body parts donated for transplants or scientific research actually gets carried out. It turns out that the cadavers livers, okay. They don't walk themselves over to the local hospital or a medical school for free. I just don't understand the outrage was that for a lot of folks was that they were selling these a baby parts. Right? So that is or isn't true. It's not true. So why was that a woman saying in the video?

Speaker 3:          00:11:21       Because it's a big hoax video. That's why she has to give to Lawson.

Speaker 1:          00:11:25       But without, without further explaining, is it because the woman was actually saying those things? So what part is a hoax? Because you were also sad that that woman was kind of rogue because she was saying, she was talking about how much money they could make from it. I'm really confused. Like what is the hook? So I understand that the people that were, um, that were making the video weren't really what they were sending you saying they were right. These people, they set this up and they got inside of planned parenthood. The way they were going through the, um, the body parts, the way they were picking up the body parts and, but that was all real. I mean, there's 100% real, the way there's, there's no way. It wasn't unless they're rubber baby parts and they had actors. Is there a chance to, the audio you were hearing wasn't what, that's what they're saying match up the video, the people's faces.

Speaker 1:          00:12:14       You could see him saying it. Me and Lizzie was just fucking brilliantly done by terrorists that says that if you plow through the transcripts, you won't see what that, I mean, all this also could be talking about a separate video from what you just saw maybe. But uh, these fucking things are so, so confusing. So there's a new or newly released video that just came out that's a literally two hours ago, um, online and this is the stem express CEO. I don't know man. It's um, it's fucking, it's just, it's really one of those things. Abortion, it becomes one of those left or right issues where you're either a left wing person, you support abortion or you're right wing person. You'd think it's terrific. I, uh, I support people's right to do whatever they want to do. I totally support people's right to have abortions, but at a certain point in time, like when is an abortion completely fucked up? Like when you have a nine month old baby inside you and decide to kill it before it comes into your vagina. It's why it's illegal. Yeah. But at a certain point in time that baby's still viable outside the womb. But you could still have an abortion.

Speaker 2:          00:13:27       Yeah. What does it say? And I mean they changed it so many times. I think it, is it like six week or no, it's something. It's something, it's not too crazy. Maybe it's six weeks. It's like two or three months or something like that. I think it's the most,

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       they were talking about 22 week old. They were talking, they were talking about like when you can like really pick out Oregon's and when he could see them. You know, that's all. That's fucking four, eight, 12 I mean think about it, when you start going into at six months old that's like, Whoa, that's a, that's a fucking baby.

Speaker 2:          00:13:59       I would really like to know what this statistics is. If what you know, if you're going to get an abortion, how long until you wait. Because I, I, it seems like most people I know, once they find out they're pregnant, they're like, next day I'm getting an abortion, you know, cause they had sex with you. But I wonder how many people are like, you know, like three months in like, you know what, I think I don't want this baby. That's when it gets kinda creepy in my opinion.

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       Yeah. Well we all know people that are completely irresponsible and if you give them a way to justify anything and so they don't have to take responsibility for it and just take, take it out of me. You know, they don't want to think if they don't see it in front of them, they don't think of it as a baby. The question really becomes, should you be allowed to do that? And it's not my call. I don't know who's called is. I don't know. I mean some people think it's their call, some people think that they should be blown up abortion clinics and shooting doctors and you know, they decided that they're there to protect the children and uh, that gets pretty fucked up too. And it also gets pretty hypocritical because those are the same kind of people that are supportive of war. You know, once your kid eats, reaches 18 or if that kids from another country, fuck them. Now this is weird, but it was, it was real weird looking at the unescapable reality, that video. So whatever, whatever's fake or real in the conversations that they're having, um, there's no denying at all those body parts. And that's where it gets really crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:15:26       Well, we all knew that existed. I, you know, when, when you get an abortion, what it usually is like a, like a car wash, like, uh, you know, vacuum, you know, it's like a, it's a big tube and it goes into like a humongous, like little pot or a at tank or whatever. So, you know, if you're going to look in that tank and you're going to see you just not, you're not supposed to see it, you know? Well, yeah. That's isn't that it's kind of part of the problem, right? They're not supposed to see it. Yeah. I mean, if you look at anything like that, you're going to be like, that's fucked up. Yeah, but it's, that is the fuck

Speaker 1:          00:16:00       dup one, right? Because babies are helpless and once they're alive, we want to take care of them. And here you've got these people with tweezers picking up arms with little fingers attached to it. It's like, Whoa, whatever is in that video that's fake. You know? That's not, that's, that's, that's terrifying. I don't know. You know, I don't know what's a live, I'll Google debunked and I'm sure there's a a lot that tells you, but it's just left wing sites are saying it's debunked or right wing sites are continuing to promote it. It gets really weird.

Speaker 1:          00:16:43       Ooh, what a bummer. What a, what a bad way to start off the puck right now. Yeah, that's what I saw. That's how I started on my morning. That and the Cecil, the lion, his cousin who killed a fucking safari guide and the same in the same place where Cecil the lion got killed. This fucking guy was leading walking photographic safari tours. So the safari guide for the walking photographic safari tour got taken out by a lion. The lion was like, what are you doing outside the GP dumped fuck and just just jacked him. It's hilarious that people are that stupid that they think they think they can walk around where lions are walking around in this enormous enormous park in Zimbabwe where lions are protected.

Speaker 4:          00:17:28       Have you ever been to one of those like safari tours where like the animals come right up and like the lines and the monkeys just jump on your car or anything like that?

Speaker 1:          00:17:36       Um, I've been to one of those wild animal parks in New Jersey to do that. It was a, it was real weird. It just, it just feels goofy. Like you're in your car and there's monkeys jumping on your car and they'll break your windshield wipers. They do all kinds of fucked up shit to car. I don't even know if that place is still open anymore, but it's just, it's odd. They would let you drive around in your car and a, you'd be on this tour and that means better, I guess than the zoo. But it's gotta be fucked up for the monkeys because it's like the same thing is looking at people through glass, except you're looking at people through glass that moves on rubber wheels and you're just looking at these people that are free and you're stuck in this enclosure and they're driving into your house.

Speaker 1:          00:18:19       You know, they're on a road, but it said it was weird. It's, it's like there's something fucked up about zoos. Just something really fucked up about zoos. All of them, you know, less fucked up for some animals. Like my joke about giraffes that giraffe seem to be pretty happy. The zoo, like babies can feed them. It's like, it's true man. My three year old, when she was, well when she was three rather, we brought her to the zoo and she was feeding giraffes with her hand and there was no worry at all. Everybody's laughing and having a good time. No giraffe has ever fucked up a kid at the zoo for feeding it.

Speaker 3:          00:18:52       It'd be really interesting to see if animals could talk to me like, no dude, you don't understand. I get to hang out here to see people feed me. I don't have to do shit here. Like it might be the Cecil the lion killer costume. Is it coming out or it has come out. Uh, which is interesting that they would actually do that. It's actually a decapitated lion with a dentist, uh, outfit with blood all over the dentist outfit. And the guy that owns the company said that they've had so many requests for it. So that, I guess that's a thing that's this hallway Halloween Cecil the lion cost of course that had to come out. Yeah. You knew that was coming out. I mean, who? Who didn't see that coming? There it is Cecil. The lion splattered all over. The guy's still in hiding. Huh? Nobody's seen that dude. I think I heard just the other day he opened up his business to know, have you looked at her page? That's not good.

Speaker 1:          00:19:47       I heard a, I heard he was going to reopen up his business in September. That's Kinda fucked up. But Yelp, because they're not even reviewing his business. They didn't go and yet their teeth, teeth

Speaker 3:          00:19:58       cleaned or io. I hope I haven't looked lately, but I hope Yelp stepped in because I mean, yeah, it got where it was just deadlines and his like, like photos. Whereas dentist office was his deadlines and photos upload photos of sued, stuff like that. This, this is my lion after I brought it to the dentist. Wow. So TMZ did a poll with almost 16,000 votes, if that was funny or offensive about the Cecil. The lion costume in 66% said that's offensive. You know why? Because there's 66% of people so fucking stupid. They post on CNN. TMZ that those people are apes. Those are people too dumb for Youtube. Like youtube is like, you're too stupid for our comments. You got to go over, you've got to go post over there. What do you think? Finally throwing one from my opinion was thinking the fountain

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       because he's one of the beautiful animal. Jimmy Kimmel cried. Jimmy Kimmel crying, I'm going to cry to Jimmy Kimmel gave me the green light to grow.

Speaker 1:          00:21:01       It's pretty sad. Well, it's fucked up. It's fucked up that the only way to save lions is to make them valuable for hunters. That's ultimately, that's the most fucked up thing about it. You know, that these people, the idea that this is like, there's two types of, of hunting for conservation that kind of makes sense to me. And the like when you have to kill certain animals because they're killing other animals. Like if you have too many lions and you have to control the population, but that's not really the case. Like that kind of hunting for conservation makes sense to me. Or if there's like a lot of people don't realize that that Rhino, that that guy paid a shitload of money to shoot. They were going to kill that rhino anyway. They had to kill that rhino cause that rhino was killing other, the rhinos.

Speaker 1:          00:21:47       And when they do that, they, they have to uh, this is a like a non-viable mail. It's not breeding anymore. And so it was attacking other males and killing them and even tact female and killed it. They think so that's, that's an animal they have to kill. So if, if you get a guy who's willing to pay you a shitload of money to cook, kill that Rhino that you were already going to kill and then that money goes to conservation. That makes sense. So those are the two cases we're hunting for. Conservation makes sense to me. Other than that, hunting for food is the only thing that makes sense to me. I don't get the idea of hunting like an animal just because you want to like add it to your collection. I think that's kind of fucked up unless it's the only thing. The only time it makes sense is that it has to be killed.

Speaker 1:          00:22:30       They don't have to kill those lines. There's not enough of lions that they have to kill them. It's not like there's an overwhelming number of lions, like they have to take them out because they were eating each other like bears and Alberta I think got a real problem with bears in Alberta. They have too many of them, so that's why they let you kill two of them. They're like, please come up here and kill some fucking bears. They have a real problem with La, with a wolves up there in a BC. They don't even have a limit. You can kill as many wolves as you one PC. They want you to kill him because they're fucking everywhere. They kill people's cows. And those are the times we're hunting for conservation makes sense to me. But this lion thing, these, these are rich dudes that want to go over there and they want to fill their trophy rooms up and that's, that's a real natural reaction that people have that that's gross.

Speaker 1:          00:23:16       So just to like, it's just so everyone knows I'm not on the side of killing lions or anything, giraffes, anything, unless it's for food. They say the thing about lines is like, they kill that Rhino. Everybody ate that Rhino. The villagers came and they fucking, they fed hundreds of people with that. Rhino. Rhino is apparently tastes good like rhinos apparently or like, like beef almost. And that all these people were excited to cut off, uh, pieces of that rhino and have protein. Nobody's lining up to eat a lion. You know, that's stuff. Apparently though mountain lion tastes good. Mountain lion supposedly tastes just like pork and it's apparently something that people have been eating since they, uh, since the pioneers came to America, I never got it. It's supposedly good with like a blueberry sauce. They make like Loin, like want mountain line loin. I would try it.

Speaker 1:          00:24:08       I would definitely shoot a fucking mountain line. Those cons, eight, my dog and I don't like him. I don't trust him. They're just running around in our woods and there was no shortage of me either. Especially in California. California is so goofy. They don't have a mountain lion season in California because we don't have a department of fishing game in California. We have a department of fish and wildlife. It has a totally different like nomenclature attached to it. And because of that, like it's run by like wildlife lovers more than it's run by like hunting advisers. So like in every other state, they look at the game numbers, they look at the mountain lions, they look at like and they try to manage it accordingly. And they also trying to manage it because you get a lot of money from hunting tags and California, they, they're less concerned with that.

Speaker 1:          00:24:55       And because of that they lose out on a lot of money on hunting tags cause they'll have, they'll have less hunters because they literally have less deer. And the reason why they have less direct cause they have more mountain mines. It's, it's a real controversial thing with h with the hunting in California as opposed to with every other state. It's interesting. It's all interesting stuff. It's like what, what people decide and not decide that you can eat because there's all, or what you can kill. Because in these places where they have these hunting laws, you can just drive down the street like California, drive down any street and you're just going to pass by Jack in the box and burger king and chicken places and they're filled. Filled. Yeah. California. And finally has wolves. Yay. Great Wolf pack of wolves. Fantastic wait fucking disaster. We put him there or did they just kind of, when we put them in Idaho, we put them in a lot of other states and they're making their way down to California now. And what's the purpose is having wolves to take to kill these people are assholes. They forget. They forget. Uh, there was a story that I tweeted the other day about um, famous, uh, uh, strong men throughout history, famous athletes throughout history. And one of them was a guy who, uh, tried to, uh, split these two trees and he got stuck in between the two trees and he got eaten by wolves.

Speaker 1:          00:26:15       This is like in the, you know, the BC days, but the, I mean, we've talked about this numerous times on the podcast. How many people throughout history have been eaten by wolves? That was a huge issue until people started killing the fuck out of wolves. And that's why we look at wolves now. Like there are dogs. We'd look at them like their pets. They were never pets before. They were always these terrifying animals that, that, that killed human beings. That's why they were always a part of folklore. That's why they were always a part of stories like the Little Red Riding Hood story or Goldie locks. I mean there's always a, the three pigs, there was always stories of the big bad wolf because wolves were something that everybody was really scared of. The wolves in Paris, story from the 14 hundreds wolves killed, I think it was something like 40 people in Paris, France in the 14 hundreds before they, they fucking rallied together and killed these goddamn things in.

Speaker 1:          00:27:12       During World War One, the Russians and the Germans literally stopped shooting each other. They had a cease fire so they could kill wolves because there was so many people getting killed by wolves. These soldiers would be on patrol and they would never find them. They're like, what the fuck? And they'd go and they'd find like a foot that was still stuck in a boat and their bodies would be eat and wolves were just, they were getting these super packs of wolves of a hundred wolves together and they would just kill people. That's always been the case. Just, we eradicated them from our lives and we'd no longer have a threat of moles, but now they, they implanted them, they took them from Canada where they have a real problem with them. Where I do, like I said in BC, you can kill as many wolves as you want.

Speaker 1:          00:27:54       You can go to BC right now and you can kill 50 wolves today. If you could find 50 wolves, you can kill them all and they want you to, cause they're hard to kill. They're hard to find. They're smart shit. They worked together in packs and they decimate moose populations. Uh, they decimate elk, deer, cows, whatever the fuck. They get a hold, they'll eat your dog, they'll eat everything they get ahold of and that's what they do. They run around, they eat things. So some, I'm sure goofy liberal conservationists decided to take these wolves and bring them from northern Canada and these big ass fucking gray wolves and bring them down to a America. Here's a picture that Jamie just pulled out, wolf attack, scroll down so I can read that again. Sorry. Wolf attack leads to state of emergency and Siberia's and Russia. Siberia region is two years ago, there was 400 wolves in a super pac running around.

Speaker 1:          00:28:49       She says, fuck the governor of Russia's largest reasons. Declared a state of emergency after a surge of wolf attacks. Fuck walls, man. People are just so goofy. We have this beautiful thing that we've created. We've created an amazing thing and cities, you know, you go to the grocery store, you get your food, you walked down the street, you hold hands with your kids. No one's looking over their shoulder for bears. And because of that, we have this real detachment from the rest of the natural world that is outside of our cities. And we live our whole lives and these cities and our perspective of animals is completely shaped by these cities. But these animals out there don't give a fuck about you. They don't give a fuck about your city. They exist to eat and kill things. They don't have language. They don't have culture. They live. They don't care about you. And all our ideas about them are all from the lion king. And some fucking goofy ass cartoons and movies, the anthropomorphize versions of these animals. It's really ridiculous. And that's where all the Cecil, the lion king shit comes from. Cecil the lion king.

Speaker 1:          00:30:03       That's where all this Cecil outrage comes from. Meanwhile, Justin Wren, who was on the podcast yesterday told us that 5,000 children under the age of five die every day in Africa from bad water. Every day, 5,000 human babies die because they don't have water. And we're worried about Elian that by the way killed. Who knows how many other lions babies because that's what they do when you see a male lion and he is successful and he runs a pride Garr run fucking tee. That line has been killing baby male lines cause that's what they do when the babies are born and it's not theirs, they just fucking slaughter them. They slaughter them when they go into a new kingdom and they take over and they fucked some females and she's got males, a little male babies, they fucking slaughter him. They chased him down the Killam. I put a video up of it on the, on Twitter. People went crazy. They went nuts. Call me an asshole for putting up a video of nature. It's nature. That is, this is what happens. So these people that are happy now, we finally have wolves in California. It's amazing. One day it'd be walking with you, a little cocker Spaniel and a wolf's gonna come along and eat you and the cocker spaniel.

Speaker 2:          00:31:23       It's been a hundred years almost that since we've had wolves in California. So I think that's what they're more amazed at. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:31:29       these people are so fucking stupid. Why don't they bring back dinosaurs? We need more dinosaurs we can to bring back titanosaurs to Arizona. There was a, it was an amazing place when dinosaurs roamed these to fly phase to fly. We're going to have cared. Terra doctorals launch our first pterodactyl governor. Yay. They're gonna open up the cage. It's going to swoop right back. Kill the governor.

Speaker 2:          00:31:55       They released, somebody released a funny video where they showed that photo of Steven Spielberg in front of the dinosaur and they went to people on the street and go, what do you think about that? Almost everybody was just like, I can't believe he did that. He should be held accountable, I guess in this fake trust. Sarah top. Yeah. I guess Nestle a water just got caught from stealing a bunch of natural water and so a lot of people are, uh, protesting Nestle for stealing, um, California water while we're in this huge drought. Yeah, I guess that's real. Yeah. Nestle pays only $524 to extract 27 million gallons of California drinking water. Come on. She's like, for companies get exempt from that.

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       A water ban on their blog and they can sell it. Yeah. The bottled water and alcohol and all sort of kind of goofy deals have these assholes made with politicians that they could steal water during a drought and then sell it to us. Yeah, that's insane. For $524, they stole 27 million gallons of water from 12 springs and Strawberry Canyon for the brand. Isn't that ridiculous? But yet we can't wash a car, take a phone over a five minute shower, corporate America, folks,

Speaker 1:          00:33:13       Corporate America. You know, corporations are beautiful and a lot of ways, I mean, that's the root why we have these microphones. It's why we have these laptops. It's why we have cell phones. It's all corporations that created them. But corporations, they're all about infinite growth. They constantly want to make more money. Every year they're supposed to make more money. If a corporation makes you know, x amount of money one year and then the same x amount of money the next year, they're a failure. Which is hilarious. That's ridiculous. Like if they made, like if apple apple makes like whatever they make, let's say, let's just make a number. Apple made $4 billion this year, right? If they make $4 billion next year, they failed. You're supposed to make 4 billion plus the new money. It's incredible, man.

Speaker 4:          00:34:03       It says here, the most popular size bottle of arrowhead is one liter and it retails for 89 cents putting the potential profit for Nestle in the tens of billions. So they're just making billions of dollars on water that they've taken from ice while we're going through a drought.

Speaker 1:          00:34:22       It only costs 89 cents for a one liter bottle of water. Why do I feel like it costs more? Because the vending machines, vending machines. So he's like,

Speaker 4:          00:34:29       oh yeah. Fitting machines are a super over price.

Speaker 1:          00:34:31       The whole thing is gross. It's gross, it's gross across the board. And it's also gross that like there's, um, there's a lot of crops that use this water and um, there's a lot of waste involved apparently. And there have been bills that were passed, like Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was governor, said that they had come up with a solution, um, at least a partial solution. And he was bringing it up to one of the other politicians and the politicians saying, even though this is an effective solution, I could never bring it before my people, I can never endorse it because my people are the agricultural people and those people that keep me in office. So I'm going to just tell you right now, well, we're just gonna create a bunch of red tape and it'll never get passed. And even though it's logical and it makes sense, I'll never support it.

Speaker 1:          00:35:21       And he was like, what the fuck? Like this is, this is what's wrong with politics and this is what's wrong. When you're dealing with people that are not really the representation, they're not really representatives of people. They're representatives of whoever got him in office. They, they can pretend to be the of the people. Sort of like late night preachers, pretend to be the servants of God. Really, they're just making money. They're making money and they're, you know, supposed to give 10% yeah, well late night preachers, you, you don't even, they don't even want 10% they want everything. You got heavy here with a tough, one of the funniest things that they have con people into doing is they figured out a way to tell people like, I know you don't have any money. I know, I know times it's tough, but what you have to understand is you have to have faith in the Lord.

Speaker 1:          00:36:09       Give everything you can. The Lord will give you that back 10 fold like they tell you if you're broke. So they're going after people who are desperate and broke and they had all these, these people that would give these, um, these speeches there would talk about what happened to them and they were saying, well, you know, I was broke and I didn't have any money and times are tough. And I was wondering how it was going to take my bills and how I was going to pay for food, but I had this $100 and I was going to use towards my rent. But I said, you know what, I'm giving this $100 to God. Everybody starts cheering and clapping. And then from that, oh Lord, I got a new job and I got a new car and everything happened. And, and, and people are clapping and cheering and music starts playing and they build it up and they're just like, making you come.

Speaker 1:          00:36:54       They're like, oh they're like, it's like this stimulation thing that they're doing and they're actively targeting people so stupid that they really can't do anything about it. Like these people, that's like the right people to rip off cause these people are broke and the reality is most people who are severely broke, they're going to stay broke. The vast majority, whatever it is, 60 70 80% pick a number, they're going to stay broke. And so that's the ones that they go after. So it's nobody cares, nobody cares about them. Like you get your rip certain people off, people get really frustrated and angry and you rip other people off.

Speaker 2:          00:37:36       Do you think in the future that's going, that's going to be not as big of a problem? Do you think religions shrinking or growing? I think religion is

Speaker 1:          00:37:44       probably overall shrinking, but stupid people are always going to exist. And so if you call it religion or if you call it a cult or you call it, I mean there's a, there's a lot of organizations that don't necessarily have some sort of a deity at the top of their, their structure. But there's still the same thing. It's one person who is, or one group of people, whether it's Scientology or anything else, one group of people that is offering you a solution for how to live your life. And they have all these guidelines that they have set up and they want you to contribute and they want your money, they want your money and they want your time and they want you to donate. Like, did you see going clear? Have you seen that? How fucking scary was that?

Speaker 2:          00:38:32       I think that any kind call like that is, or, uh, like I just saw a celebrity wife swap and I know this sounds weird, but Corey Feldman and Tommy Davidson where the two people that switched, uh, and they really showed you an inside look of how Corey Feldman treats his, uh, Corey angels is what he calls him. He's trying to do kind of like a cross between Hugh Hefner and Michael Jackson or something like that. He pretty much has brainwashed these girls, uh, to, to fall anything he says. And it includes like a contract that they have to sign. Oh, well, you know that Corey was an actor his whole life, right. You know, is probably a bullshit artist and it's most likely that this is a hustle. Hustle may be, but I know a girl, let me say this right, I know a girl that knows that girl and that girl used to be one of his angels and uh, she left because it was too call like, and the things that you were, you had to do once a week, they would have an orgy and then that they would just do drugs, have an orgy, have people over.

Speaker 2:          00:39:43       And then the days after that orgy you would work out to yoga. I eat healthy and uh, it's uh, she, she said to the her friend how it was just like brainwashed girls looking for their chance in Hollywood and he would be like, oh no, you join this and you follow my plan. And anyways, the episode goes really into that and it, it's, it's watching them talk and watching how he reacts to the wife swap part of it. It's very interesting. It's a, it almost seems to me that like whatever had happened to in his past maybe with Michael Jackson are his childhood, uh, is really effecting him as an adult because he's very, like, he's not making any sense. Uh, he's, he's just like not a

Speaker 1:          00:40:30       ton of drugs first of all. Right. And you know, I know a guy who was in like a swap situation before and with, with a UN no need to name celebrity was the same kind of thing where this guy like let his wife fuck other people and then we're all together and uh, he, you know, he came out of it and one of the things that he said to me when he came out of it was like, uh, you know, he told me the story. He was like, listen man, they're all fucked up. Anybody that's involved in that kind of situation is fucked up. Like they're all crazy. Like that's part of what it is. But if you're in Hollywood and you're in like that, like want to be showbiz circle, just plenty of fucked up people, you could find plenty of people. And if you can come up with some sort of a name for it, Cory's angels or whatever the hell he calls it, Eh, you could do it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:16       Yeah. Well, I mean l Ron Hubbard was a fucking moron and he was a moron. And uh, his, his, his, uh, books were terrible. They were, they were terrible. And if you like, listen to him talk, he was not a charming guy. He was not articulate. He wasn't brilliant. He wasn't this guy that had this point, like even like David Koresh, although he's a dip shit, he played stupid songs or that the fucking idiot in Australia that claims he's Jesus, they have a certain amount of confidence and smoothness to them. L Ron Hubbard didn't have any of that. And meanwhile, Scientology became a gigantic organization. I think for a lot of people, the structure, any sort of structure is comforting and they're looking for something. So like, you know, get back to the original point, is religion going away? There's going to have to be something big that happens to human beings for religion to go away.

Speaker 1:          00:42:11       And I wonder if that big thing, what would have to, it would have to be, people would have to be able to clearly see what you know and what you don't know. It would have to be a fundamental change in how we communicate because like when someone tells you, I know that if you give that $100 to know load will pay you back 10 fold. Have you say that to someone who's stupid? Like okay, he knows he knows a little pay me back. I got to give that money and the Lord was going to pay me back 10 fold. You know, you really believe it. But if you could see that, oh he doesn't really know that. If there was like a light bulb that went over a person's head when they were telling the truth or you could look in their eyes and you could see the numbers, like there's excellent, you know, like a Turkey tester you ever, you know, gobble, gobble, gobble. You ever see those, uh, what's your gates? Yeah, those things that put the lights out, use those anymore. Yeah. You probably like leak fucking chemicals. Probably not supposed to have plastic inside a Turkey that you're cooking, but like something along those lines, like a temperature gauge or a number or something where you could see whether or not someone's being honest, where they really know what they're saying or whether or not they're bullshitting. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:43:19       Well, what's interesting about this, Corey Feldman, they stuck on that sheet. If you watch it, you'll be no, I mean I went frantic on it. Kind of go. I'm not going to watch and we watch a little clip. I do. Is Him introducing you, his angels kicked off of Youtube for your fucking Corey Feldman week session or would we

Speaker 1:          00:43:34       probably, probably, yeah. Well we can watch it over there. Right? Can we watch over there and not really watch it? We can watch it, but we can't. Can we play volume? Maybe. Maybe. All right. We'll see what happens. Jamie's kept good editing skills. All right. Play that bitch over here and freaked me out. Go ahead. In our relationships. So these are the girls is not, it is down here. I was like, oh, that girl's hot. How's it getting that? Um, but uh, it's the one right here. Meet Corey Feldman and his angels, the former child actor scroll down, lives in eccentric and avant garde lifestyle with his angels. What avant garde, what is avant garde mean?

Speaker 4:          00:44:18       Oh, look at him. I'm Corey Feldman. You probably know me from lost boys getting e's stand by me and only started acting and singing simultaneously. I've been

Speaker 6:          00:44:32       in singer and musician for several decades now. I am a bit eccentric a bit Ivan Guard, but if I was just like everybody else, I wouldn't be on your TV sets. Ooh. I have a lot of women with their careers and Hollywood and then I would realize they went off to be successful. And what did I get out of it? Not much. That's why I developed my company. Cory's angels. Cory's angels is a management production and development business comprised of beautiful, talented, we girls sign a contract with us so when they do succeed, I can get rewards as well for the work that I put it to that when the girls become angels, they move into my house. I see why you're obsessed.

Speaker 6:          00:45:22       You frankly, drag van trust model and I'm one of course angels. I am Caitlin and I am an aspiring actress, professional model and Cory's angel and training. I'm Courtney. I'm a Dj and I'm Cory's manger. Oh, I, Oh hell out. Also, I'm his girlfriend. Cory has changed my life in so many ways. He uses in his own connections to help me be successful. He's sexy and gorgeous and I love him. Is this the polyamorous as far as what happens behind closed doors? It stays behind closed doors. Exactly. We have a very kind of strict regimens. Goal number one, we will put them on the Angel Diet. That means no meat of any kind. I'm a fruitarian, which means that I only eat fruit. Number two, exercise like, go ahead you guys. Hot. Number three, we don't allow men on the property unless they're inviting guests. That's how you do it. This lifestyle is not for the close minded or faint of heart. I strive every day to do God's will. Yay.

Speaker 3:          00:46:36       So he makes these girls wear these slutty outfits. They're not. They have to wear like these broad and lingerie's. They're not allowed to work close. Hold up. This is on ABC? Yeah, he's on the ABC's going Desperado. Huh? Well I tell you desperate as fuck through written network TV is desperate. Yeah. And I was really sad is that Tommy Davidson was the guy that they swapped with and his, he has like a nice family kids and so they brought the angel over, uh, to his house and the angel's like getting like Bachelor parties and naked people in his house went in front of it's kids and okay. Okay. You know that they arrange that. The producers arranged that. He seemed pretty pissed off. He just left the house. What the fuck course. And of course he did. Oh yeah. I'm sure there's a sea salt. This is all 100% fake.

Speaker 3:          00:47:22       Hundred percent arranged. This is all planned out. Cory has a fucking one piece of hair waxed that hangs strategically front of his face. Yeah. I mean this is a scam. What this is, is Cory's shot at getting back on TV and what he's doing is getting those girls with him and it's working. It's getting them exposure. They're getting on TV. So his plan is to be this guy who's the, the, the ringleader. I'm Cory. These are Cory's angels. This is the hustle we're going to get on ABC. And he's getting it for them. But whether or not this is all real, he's been doing the angel thing for a long time course cause it says this is hustle. This is how he's getting, it's like a pyramid scam forum. Sort of. I mean this is his intertainment shtick. This is how he's getting some form of attention.

Speaker 3:          00:48:08       He, uh, when these girls leave the angels, he has contracts that hit the, he gets a percentage of everything they make from that on. Good. Good luck. You're going to get 50 bucks from the chick who works at Guitar. Now what is he gonna make? I mean if they do get big, they'll have him killed. Do you know if one of those girls gets huge? She gets it, becomes the next Rihanna or whoever the fuck she is. Who are you still have that car killed? Please watch it though. It's on Hulu. It's, it just takes smoke a joint, cut the breaks of his VW bug and push him off a fucking cliff. He's announce hall. Do you have that video of him at, at the baseball game? He took his band. You're obsessed. This, this is crazy. He took, he took his band and he opened up or he played at a minor league baseball game and uh, he just watch it. It's pretty ridiculous. You are fucking absurd. So chip, here's this band. By the way, none of these instruments I, somebody told me none of these instruments are actually,

Speaker 7:          00:49:11       they're not actually playing. These instruments are not what you think. They should be real about that. Well, they're authentic with their art.

Speaker 8:          00:49:18       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:49:19       He's still doing the Michael Jackson thing. That's why he has his hair like that state college spikes. What does that mean? Uh, yeah, I think a minor league baseball.

Speaker 8:          00:49:31       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:49:34       People don't know what to do. Look up. There's only like 20 people in the audience and they're looking at this like it's a do that one white guy bouncing around even stopped. He bounced for a little and people like, what are you doing? Oh yeah, you're right. What am I doing? Look at this guy with his camera. I'm more wrong. My Kid, the guy on stage bottom right. Just a little laughing his ass off at how ridiculous a shit was. Looking at him with his fucking shiny pants. That guy is so bizarre. I look at the girls, but listen man, if you're that guy and you, you, you have to be the guy that like lets these girls fuck other guys because otherwise they're going to, but they're going to get bored with you. You wait 15 pounds and you're a fucking freak. He doesn't like guys into his. Of course he does, Dude. He also holds and they might not go into his house, but they have orgies. They don't just have origins with him. Okay. Other dudes are given those girls, Dick Guaranteed caucus that Jesus, that guy's like, what the fuck the girl is like, get, get the hat, get that. Toss it back to me in a second.

Speaker 7:          00:50:45       Oh my God. What is this song? It's this. He's trying to be Michael Jackson. Well. He's like a combination of Michael Jackson, Charlie, Charlie Sheen, Eddie vetter. He's really weirdly Pale too. Oh here you guys saw my daddy freelancing. It's breaking it down. He can't make eye contact with people because they're, they're all like looking at him like he's a freak. So like he's doing all this crazy dancing and they're not reacting. It's very strange and he doesn't look at them. He's sort of like looking like at like their knee area. You know what I mean? He did the Michael Jackson thing with the dancer too. Is that again, I would steal that fucking hat. I would steal that fucking man. It's on the ground. Why isn't anybody going for pussies? Someone go, you had a chance. We'll get tangled up in some chords and the a lot of rescue him.

Speaker 7:          00:51:43       He's tangled. He's fucking tangled. Look out, look out a little stages. There's cords everywhere cause you're like a hot air balloon holding those courts up wise their cars because of course they go straight up into the sky. Wait, we didn't just stay in one place. Here's the plan that he got set up on this whole event that set up. Yeah. That's someone fucked him. That's why he wants that so bad. How could someone set him up? He's, he's dancing. They're singing. There's no one there. It was after baseball game. It was unprofessional and, Oh Yada, Yada. Oh my God. He's, he lost his Special Olympics game gate

Speaker 1:          00:52:17       gig because of this video. What? He was supposed to play the spa, a special Olympics come gig. And he lost it after this video. So no, and he's upset about it. The Special Olympics. Yeah. Imagine if he got booed by retarded people, but is his shit, I shouldn't say retarded because they don't have, they have down's syndrome. Trans started there. There's something wrong with them. Retarded is not a real word. That's why I resent the fact that you're not supposed to use retarded for people that are idiots. And then I went and used it for people that have legitimate issues. That's, uh, he's, he might be regarded. There's something wrong. There's something definitely wrong, but it's also like there's that thing that happens when you become like a Gary Coleman or like someone who's a, a personal, you're a punchline and you're kind of on the outside like that. When they get real freaky, they get like they get desperado and it all becomes one attempt after the next to try to get attention. You know, you see it a lot from reality stars that like they, they're there 15 minutes and then they start scrambling to try to like do new stents and new, different things. Do you remember kid was under the real world? His name is

Speaker 3:          00:53:28       puck. Yeah. Dead. No, I saw them on a sunset like uh, maybe a year ago. I saw him on Sunday. How does a guy like that feed himself? Uh, how does that work? You didn't look like he wasn't, but what does a guy like that do for a Gig for a while? I bet he made money. I mean this, he was around 20 years ago though, but you probably made money as a peer on appearances for like 10 years just being puck. We still know his name,

Speaker 1:          00:53:54       pulled it out of the back of my ass. But the reason why I know it is because he was that guy that was like always doing exaggerated things and always being ridiculous to try and get attention. But there's a lot of those fucking people, man. I mean that's, that's, that's like what the reality show world sort of creates,

Speaker 3:          00:54:12       reduces, it looks like puck was in prisons now an ex con, he's now living as a makeup artist who sounds like he hates women. He says he was with Oj in prison for two years. He was with Oj. Wow. He was in for stalking.

Speaker 1:          00:54:29       Oh my God. Oh Jesus Christ. He was in fucking jail for stalking. Yeah. Wow. Hmm. Okay. Poor bastard. But you know what I mean? That's my point is that these people that become like a punchline, they get to that. And also the other thing is being a guy like Corey Feldman, I don't know. I'm sure he's a fine fellow. Never met him. Never met him. Sure. He's a fine fellow. I don't know. It doesn't seem like a mean person. It's not a hateful person. This is where I think it's fucked. That guy became famous when he was a little kid and I think when you become famous in your little kid, your odds of developing as an adult, like a guy that we can hang out with and talk to. Just a normal balanced person, they're almost fucking none. I've only met a couple of people that I know were famous when they were young that I can hang out with and talk to her. Like Ricky Schroder, he's one of them. Rick, he's pretty goddamn normal for someone who has grown up like in the public eye, but he has been kind of out of the public eye for a long time and he's got a family. He's very close to his family. He's got a lot of interests. He makes documentaries, he hunts, he like Ricky's a different sort of cat. So he's like one of the few that like was famous when he was young that I could hang out with. No problem.

Speaker 3:          00:55:52       Yeah, it wouldn't. When you went to ask her if that maybe with like famous when young and still trying to be famous the whole time cause you just want to get out and they, they make it or they get out for a long time and they can come back. That's a good point. That's a very good point. Like Jodie foster was famous when she was young. She was in taxi driver and she's famous now and she seems pretty fucking fun. It seems fun. What do you got there? Brian Moore. Corey Feldman. Your fucking coy Feldman. Uh, two years ago Corey Feldman told cops he was molested and his abusers, but they did nothing because they were too focused on the Michael Jackson investigation, which seems suspect right there that he telling him, meaning they were abused by someone other than Michael Johnson, which he said that he writes, the relationship with Jackson was the healthiest in his life and that he never abused in which, you know, whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:56:41       But he said he was molested and he told the cops who molested him and they did nothing. Well, why would he say that? And not just say who molested. Exactly. And then he spiraled into drug abuse. Having regular coke off challenges with friends and doing heroin. You ever been in a coke off at coke off? No. Do you think you could win? Know how? What's your tolerance like? Eh, I'm not into like I know people that can just sit there and do coke all day long and just whatever. I'll have like one line and be like, okay I'm good. I've got to calm down now I've got to come. You know, cause he's drink so much coffee. Yeah, exactly. Go there. Already elevated. Right now a Trenta has gotta be unhealthy for you. Two shots in there. Two shots. You know what's worse is getting a Trenta of cold brew, which is 10 times more powerful than a regular coffee.

Speaker 3:          00:57:28       What's not, not more, but it is more powerful that Starbucks says it's 10 times. Yeah, we should look at that. What is the new cold brew? It was really 10 times more powerful than regular coffee that literally would be like that. Have you ever seen that caffeine powder that they sell? Yeah. Kids have taken like tablespoons of caffeine powder and died like it does. It has absolutely killed people. And I would think that if cold brew was really 10 times stronger than a regular coffee because we have those La nitrile cold brews. I had a cold brew today, just Caveman Coffee. This shit right here. This stuff is God damn delicious. Cold brew concentrate. You take this, he put a third of this in a bar in a glass and then the two thirds water is delicious and it's, it's awesome. It's strong shit, but it's not 10 times stronger.

Speaker 3:          00:58:17       Um, so a 16 ounce Starbuck bucks, cold brew coffee, 16 ounce, which is, I guess they're small, right? It's 200 milligrams. I don't think that's the small, I think that's the Grande's 16 200 milligrams. I think that's standard standard cold brew. That's a 16 ounces. I think 200 is around what it normally is a what's called Starbucks. What makes you say it's 10 times stronger? That's what they told me at Starbucks. Oh, that's just some asshole behind the counter at Starbucks. Uh, trying to sell you a script. Coffee. I'm stronger. It was brewed on an island where they make dinosaurs read my script. Uh, a 16 ounce iced coffee has, see where it said it's not 10 times. I mean, if it's slightly more powerful I'd be surprised. But you know, Starbucks is a pretty strong anyway. Starbucks is way stronger than most coffee. They put more coffee in the, uh, more Grimes and the thing when they, when they brew it up. But the shit that we

Speaker 1:          00:59:21       serve here, this is pretty strong. Jamie makes it pretty. God Damn.

Speaker 3:          00:59:26       Um, thick ice coffee is, did you see a Floyd Mayweather, his new car? He has a new car. Oh yeah. Was it a I don't even a Codec Koenigsegg Kona Sig. Yeah. Yeah. I've seen those things. Point 7 million it says, but come on, those things don't cost six point $7 million. Most things I was seen was 4.7. This article right here says 6.7, one of two. Damn. Yeah. He drove it down to fat Burger on the Strip two nights ago and such a crowd came that he had to get a flatbed to take it home because they didn't want to drive it. Why? I said the article said he was too scared to drive it home through the crowd, through the crowd because he didn't want to fuck it up. That doesn't make any sense. Yeah. Yeah. It's not 10 times. It's 40 milligrams more, but still it's more,

Speaker 1:          01:00:16       that's some guy tell me that put me on different dysentery. I'll pretend that I'm a girl. It's come on Rad band. If 10 times more posting all day on Tmz and then I came over here to work at Starbucks. I don't want you to have me on your show, man. I'm on red band. No. What's stupid is that you believe that I worked at Starbucks. It seems pretty high and I thought, and that doesn't seem right. I saw this today. Did you see this today? A kid fell and accidentally punched through a one point $5 million painting play that play that cause this hilarious. First of all, how fucking stupid or day where you could just have this thing right in front of people. Like watch this kid's slips.

Speaker 9:          01:01:02       Oh.

Speaker 1:          01:01:04       Holding his drink and punch through a one point $5 million fucking painting. And then this lady comes over. All you get out of here. Who? Yeah. How was that? Just hang up right there. Why don't they have it in case in glass, by the way. I went to the La County Museum of art inside of the day. Thank you. I'm just the one of the worst pieces of shit. Oh God. It is like a fucking scene in a movie where you mock pretentious modern art. Yeah. Dude, I'm going to show you some pictures and these are real fucking pictures.

Speaker 3:          01:01:44       See the painting that was just a white painting that had nothing on it or the room where there's nothing in it except a chair.

Speaker 1:          01:01:51       Yes, I did. Even even better. I saw the box. Did you see the box? Which uh, they're, they're trying to say is a work of art is a fucking plexiglass box. Yeah. This is it. It's roped off. Can you say that? Can you focus it on that? Just because some people could see how fucking stupid this is and there's some sort of pretentious explanation for why this box is significant. All it is is a fucking plexi glass box. Like if you had it in your, it might make a cool coffee table I guess. Like, oh, that's a cool coffee table. Where'd you get it? It's a priceless piece of art from the Lockbox, from La County Museum of art. It, that place is dog shit. It is one of the worst fucking museums I've ever been to in my life. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:02:33       I've gone on rants about this in the past because I love art museums. Had Columbus Art Museum in Columbus. Ohio is a great museum. I even, the Huntington Library, which is here in Pasadena, I believe is one of the best art museums I've ever been to. This one though. I mean literally it was a joke. I was so pissed off after going to have how many rooms you would just walk into a room and they're just be like a shoe and you're just like, wait, that's it

Speaker 1:          01:02:59       with my kids because I thought it'd be fun. Take the kids to the art museum. My kids love art. Like they could see some cool paintings and shit. And I knew we were fucked when we first got there cause we walked into this room and it looks like there's these curvy walls like, and I felt like, well you go inside the curvy walls is probably some cool paintings. No, the curvy walls where the fucking art. And I went, no, we're fucked. It's one of these places. And there was all these like super pretentious people that were like, please don't touch that. Please don't touch that. They're everywhere you go. They're like, don't touch, don't touch, don't touch. And one guy, I had my five year old on my shoulders, she could, she likes climbing on top of me. She climbs on me all the time. So she's sitting on my shoulder and he's like, sir, can you please take your daughter off your shoulder? It's a safety risk. I'm like, it's a safety risk for who? For her. I'm like, I'm not going to drop. Are you out of your fucking minds? A safety risk?

Speaker 2:          01:03:54       I highly recommend taking them to the Huntington Library. It's a cool place where they have gardens. They have like, I don't know how many gardens, like 10 different gardens. Yeah, it's cool. It's garden. It's like a different like, oh, I'm in Japan now. It's like they also have one of the best art collections ever, including like the blue boy and a bunch of really famous paintings where you're like, oh, that's interesting. That's the official, their original Abraham Lincoln painting or whatever it is. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:04:17       the, uh, LACMA. Is it also, what does that a rock that they have there? That's one of their things. It's just a big rock. Fucking hit. Somebody, God dammit. They had not, I paid and I didn't have to pay because I'm a resident of La County. You get in for free. But I said, you know what? I want to contribute, I want to contribute to, so I paid and then I just, then they had fucking jazz, which is my other least favorite thing. They had that and jazz together. It's like super pretentious meets Uber pretentious and they collide in a fucking shit storm of hipsters. Oh my God. It was so gross. Then on top of it, like they have all these art books for sale and we're like, well maybe they have some cool art books and this fucking Shit head with his rolled cuffed jeans.

Speaker 1:          01:05:04       I like, please be careful. That's a delicate book. I go, no, it's not a delicate book. It's a book. It's just a book. You fuck. It's all it is is a book. It's made at a paper like regular paper, like a regular book you clown. That was one of the biggest disappointments in my life because I wasn't looking forward to it, so it wasn't being rough with the book. I was going to touch the buck. My seven year old was, but she was just gently leafing through the pages of the book. She wasn't doing anything rough assholes and county funded assholes. That's the gross thing is that tax dollars go to support this. They have one exhibit that's all junk. It's called junk. That's like part of the name of the exhibit and you go there, it's like bottle caps that are glued to like a cork board.

Speaker 1:          01:05:49       Like you fucks you motherfuckers. You, you put this on a frame and hung it on the wall and you actually, you're charging people to see this dog shit. I mean just total dog shit. And what a waste of valuable space in Los Angeles. I mean there's rooms like 10 times bigger than my house where it's just a light bulb. This should just let homeless people move in. They really should. That should be the new museum is the homeless people shit collection. Just slip them shit all over the ground. You splay spray plastic on it to seal it and keep it in place forever. Like the homeless people Turd pile. That would be like more interesting than anything they had there. If you like, let homeless people, Shit, you can come in and shit, but you'd have to shit in this one spot and you go under the ropes.

Speaker 1:          01:06:32       There's, that's it. That's the fucking, that's that fucking thing man. God Damn it. That makes me angry. This wall, this curvy wall, which is Kinda cool. You know, if it was like in your house, I be like, oh, you have cool walls. But to say that that's a piece of sculpture. The fuck it is. Fuck you. How about that other one? The upper right hand corner. The like the sticks. So the sticks they have like, they have like a half of a fucking side of, uh, of a barn. Ooh, look at us. We're crazy. We're crazy. Look at the one below it. That's like a half of a house. Oh look. It's like this is what a house would look like if it was here. You fucking assholes.

Speaker 1:          01:07:12       I'm so angry. I was angry though. You know why I was angry? Because I was going to take my, I was trying to figure out which way to go. Should we go to the Museum of art or should we go to the Museum of natural history so we see dinosaurs and cool shit from the past or should we see art and we went with art. Huge mistake. Don't go again. Massive area. And not only that, this area is near one of the most important natural areas in Los Angeles, which is labrea tar pits. See if you find the junk collection, because if you want to fucking scoop your eyes out with spoons, it's fucking junk collection. Oh God. God Damn, it makes me angry. It was so gross. So gross and stupid. But like this is the, see that one over there. Scroll down there. The one with the feathers and the black right to the readier cursor.

Speaker 1:          01:08:06       This is the tar and feather. This is the tar and feather piece. This represents tar and feathers. No it doesn't. It's just feathers that you glued to a board and you're making people look at it. You don't think, you don't think people know what the fuck tar and feathers was like. What do you, what are you trying to say when you're trying to say whether your shitty piece of art is just like a kids' science fair? You know what I mean? Like when they're eight, nine and a half per preconstruction board thing, like Yoko Ono is somehow responsible for this museum. Well Yoko Ono had an exhibit that I want to see once in Boston and one of the exhibits was a block of wood with nails in it. And next to that was a, a box of nails and a hammer. And they asked Yoko Ono and they said like, well what is this about?

Speaker 1:          01:08:53       And she said, I want people to contribute. They be enthusiastic about the odd. So they contribute. So she encouraged people to pick up a nail that's it and hammer the fucking nail into that block of wood. She, and I'm like, if you want people to be enthusiastic, take the nails and put them in your forehead. Just put them right in your forehead and let people lack those. You'll have a line around the block. People sign up months in advance. Look at her art, would it, what does that say? Incredible. What? See what Yoko Ono's incredible. What video they, they better be joking to better be joking. Come on. Reaffirms that. She's the queen of everything. Is that really what it says? Oh my God. Yoko Ono's incredible new video. Reaffirm she's the queen of everything. No, she's a queen of tricking John Lennon and to being with her. Oh my God. Yoko Ono. Plastic Ono band. And she's like dancing and screaming and you want to hear it because it's amazing.

Speaker 7:          01:10:09       Yeah. What's up dude from quest? Love is there. Why did you do a quest? I'm a bad dancer with no regrets.

Speaker 1:          01:10:21       Fuck. And we got interrupted by a pop up for huff post newsletter. No, don't want you to newsletter. No, no, no. Now, now, now. So see that Ted Cruz guy with them. Um, I know someone who's having Ted Cruz come over their house for a fundraiser because they're a big supporter of Israel and uh, we're invited to go. I'm trying to figure out if I should go. Some people are saying, I should go just for the material, but I'm like, no, I'm just going to get angry. I don't want to get angry. That mean, have you ever heard that guy talk? He's take, why don't you, that's a good, good question. Why don't you Google Ted Cruz is a dummy and then find whatever videos they have. He's like Sarah Palin. If he was a guy with a head injury, if Sarah Palin was a guy and he got hit in the head, he's not really running for president. I agree with that. Let's listen to talk. He's just so fucking stupid. Son Wasn't born in America, so I don't know how he's going to be a president. He's born in Canadian land.

Speaker 9:          01:11:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:11:22       And they would never have them

Speaker 10:         01:11:26       listen to him talk. It's just subject to coddle and appease our enemies and so putting, you better believe Putin sees and Ben Gazi for Americans are murdered and nothing happens. There's no retribution. You better believe that Putin sees that in Syria. Obama draws a red light and ignores the red line.

Speaker 1:          01:11:44       Well, first of all, stop right there. Sounds like a gay man to me. Is that a gay man? That does not sound, I mean, not, not to stereotype too late, but there's a certain, there's a reason why we have this stereotypical gay voice. There's a reason. Why is that reason Brian's getting fucked in the ass so much. That makes it voice go high. Oh, no, no, no. Because that's what they talk like. Okay. Listen, if I talked to you like this, what am I, what do I sound like Brian? Who do I sound like Brian [inaudible] large black man, right? Large black man. A confident large black man is threatening. Why we recognize that these exist in nature. Right? Okay. Here's one. What does that it's a bird. Herodeck okay. No. PTERODACTYL

Speaker 9:          01:12:30       wow.

Speaker 1:          01:12:33       But you know what I'm saying? Like there's sounds that things make and you go, oh, I know what that is. I my fucking Gaydar says that's a gay man. Sure. Listen to him talk one more time please. Nothing to, first of all, I love gay people. It's nothing wrong with gay people and not all gay people talk like this. We've had gay people in the park, like Josh Zaps. You would never know. Looking at him or hearing him talk that he's gay. Obviously he's gay. Talks about being gay unless it's a smokescreen. This man says he's not gay.

Speaker 10:         01:13:02       Ted. We will repeal every single word of Obamacare.

Speaker 1:          01:13:08       It was big. Old people are clapping, you know one of the old people are clapping. Yep.

Speaker 10:         01:13:12       Fi's politic parties is their top priorities. Preserving their own hide and if enough congressional Democrats realize they either stand with Obama care and lose or they listened to the American people and have a chance at staying in office. That's the one scenario. We could do it in 2015 if not, we'll do it in 27

Speaker 1:          01:13:30       okay. Cut Right there. Dad is a guy who's barely keeping it together. He can't wait till that interview is over. If she could run out of there and throw a dress on and put some makeup on and some women's shoes and just rip his underwear a par and just take it from behind. There's not a doubt in my mind that that guy can't wait until that interview is over for him to be himself. He's barely holding it back like a dam, like a, a bellboy, creaky wooden dam holding back the river of his gayness, a powerful glacial river of gayness. He, uh, am I right or am I right? I a fucking challenge anybody to argue with me that that's not an a feminine man. Strongly a feminine man. Which again, there's nothing wrong with that.

Speaker 4:          01:14:20       I don't know that guy, but he seemed kind of guy.

Speaker 1:          01:14:23       I would like a gay president. I would love a gay president. We could use it. We can use a gay president. We've had a black one. I think gay be gay before woman. Lesbian. Strong gay. Strong gay. Ma'Am. I'm ma'am. Lesbian one shore. As long as she doesn't hate man one. This is not one that had a rough experience with men. I met her, Dick's to women, man, I don't want that. They don't want anybody with prejudices. You know, you're not responsible for all the men that had been Dick's, that woman. What lesbians do you know that you think could be a fine leader other than Hillary Clinton? She gay or asexual? She is married, I don't know. Good call. So it's Ted Cruz. Melissa Athletic. That's a good call. I'll say Melissa, but Melissa Etheridge thanks. And uh, love her to death. But she also thinks that if she's on a plane, everyone in the plane doesn't have to worry because she will not be in a plane that crashes because she creates her own reality.

Speaker 1:          01:15:21       That that's true. You think that's true? Yeah. Hm. It's hair stimulation. There's no evidence to the contrary. It's like when we had Burt on and Bert was talking about how he doesn't believe that you die. He goes, prove he die. I don't think you do die. Prove you die. I was like, well, it got a good point. Can't really prove it right. I mean, you know that people have died in your life and you know the things do dive. You've ever seen a person die or seen a thing? Die. Things die. But do you die or not? Who knows? Who knows what? This is even real. If you're listening to my voice, you have no idea if you die. You really don't. You as far as you know, I am a figment of your imagination. You have created this entire reality. Everything from streetlights to fucking clouds. Everything is all a part of your absolutely spectacular and vivid imagination. Every experience that you have, every sensory experience that you've taken into your entire life may in fact be a part of your, your brain trying to make sense of your imagination. And then there's Ted Cruz. It's just dreaming about Dicks.

Speaker 4:          01:16:29       I believe it. I think we are all program. I still believe it. Well you believe in simulation theory, right? I believe that we are all a program in the future. And you know, I was thinking of how's your program so weird cause I'm stoned somewhere in 2000 years from now. But uh, I was thinking how weird it is that we, we'd never, no one is born in remembers anything. You know, the first couple of years, usually at least one year, you know, like you're kind of just born and then you're slowly diluted into being, hey, I'm alive. Person, you know, and it's like this whole gray area where you just kind of, yeah, at the beginning that you're just kind of like, I guess I

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       uh, well there's a guy who has a theory about that, which is pretty fascinating. I forget the gentleman's name, but what he said was that you are not really thinking like thinking as we know it does not exist until you learn language and that until then all you're doing is like having sensations and reactions to them. But you don't have reference, you know when your mom was there because your mom gives you love. You remember that she gave you love and so he looked forward to you cry to get her and that she's in there and you're like the love is coming but you don't have an internal dialogue. You don't know that. Like, oh here comes my mom. Give up the tip, bitch, come on, I'm going to suck on some tea. Get me some milk. That's why it's funny when you have a meme with like a kid thinking cause you know the kids don't really think like that or kids words.

Speaker 1:          01:17:56       They, the idea is that once we develop a language, then we can put things into context and then we have words for all these things like chair, floor, door light, and we have this thing in our head like, man, someone shut that fucking door. I'm tired of seeing that light come through and then you have that in your head. If they would just shut that door than the fucking light wouldn't come through. God, I gotta get up in the morning and you have this internal dialogue and once that internal dialogue comes on, you know, talking about anything else that you have a point of reference for or a word for, then you're really thinking, so what a kid is doing is like experiencing a bunch of things but not thinking about it. They're not like recalling like they see it again. There'll be scared. Like the dog barked.

Speaker 1:          01:18:41       Ah, the dog freaked out and you see the dog, oh the sound's coming, but do you have this? Oh this fucking dog is going to start barking again. Somebody shot him up. That freaks me out. They don't have that internal dialogue. So that's why they don't remember anything. That's why from the time where you're like a baby and your newborn, which you really start remembering is once you hit like five, six, seven, once you have language in words, once you have words that you can recall and once you have things that you can bring up again, like my daughter will bring up stuff that happened to her when she was like three or four, you know, she's like, remember that time we saw that thing and all? Oh yeah, that was pretty cool, right? Like yeah, that was cool. I can, she's five and she'll talk about something that happened a year ago, but, but it's because a year ago she had language, you know, she could talk a year ago, but like she doesn't bring up some shit that happened when she was one.

Speaker 1:          01:19:32       She doesn't remember it. So late term abortions til about two or three I think. One, some kids taught, well, my daughter, the first daughter was talking really good at one. It's weird like some of them to start speaking really young. Some of them, they speak later and it's, it's a, it's an interesting thing. Like when, when is someone officially thinking, I think they think that, I think it was like, the idea is that 48 days after conception, the soul enters the body was like the eastern mysticism view or some, some ancient view of like when, when, uh, uh, of a fetus viable,

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       when it becomes a person that 48 days, up until then it was just a bundle of soul or a bundle of cells. It takes 48 days to install the operating system. Huh? No, something's happening. You know, you're, you're accumulating so many different, you know, your, your brain is growing, your cumulating senses. You're accumulating, your ability to perceive, your eyes are growing, they're developing, your sensations are growing and developing. It's really weird, man. I had a dream about a girl that haven't thought about in a long time. I wake up and all I did for the rest of the day is like, oh, what's she doing now? Why I should talk to her? And then I texted her and I'm thinking, how interesting is that something that I had no control of while I was dreaming? What's making me do stuff when now is awake? And I was thinking how interesting that you know the whole shutting off when you go to bed and your, your dad when you know when you're sleeping, you're just, you don't know what's going on.

Speaker 3:          01:21:05       But having that road affect your awake, rural, don't you say world world? Why? What? What is it? Why do you insist on do it? No, it's not. No it's not. No. Jamie says world too. Think retarded that Brian does. It's an Ohio thing. He's like, I know where the gas leak occurred. I might but say say when thousands and thousands. Everybody says 1050 h on the, and you have to say it that way. Thousands. It is weird though to answer a question that when you, you dream, you can dream about somebody and then when you're awake you can think about that person. Like I literally like woke up and was like, man, I need to find out what's this girl's like. It was almost not, I was like being told to do something almost and it was just because of interest for me, but it was something I had no control if I didn't want to think of this girl and you know, but I was just, that's just like an example of something that's happened recently.

Speaker 3:          01:21:53       But what other things that you dream about and you don't even realize you had a dream about, but during the day you're like, you know, I might buy some new shoes and you're like, wait, but you jumped about shoes the night before. You might not even remember, but you you dreamt about or shoes, just like shoes. She doesn't have to be connected with your dream. What's a terrible reverence? You know what I'm saying? Like, like what you're saying about the girl that is weird, that people, they get, they get contained in your memories and sometimes it gets contained incorrectly. Like why is it about like exes like you? Like generally, a lot of times people, like especially if you had a good time with that person, you only remember the good times. And then he get with them again, like you haven't seen him in forever. And he started talking to him and he goes, oh, I forgot you're fucking negative.

Speaker 3:          01:22:36       Tell negative. And there's still like bitching about everything and complaining and always looking at the downside of things. That's uh, that's something that for whatever reason, a absence makes the heart grow fonder. You know, we, we eliminate those poor memories and only want to think about the good stuff except when there's police involved. I just remember that you have, you have been in scenarios that have been quite a bit more extreme than myself. You ever heard of the men Mandela effect men dollar Andela? Like Nelson Mandela? No. What does that, it's a theory that, uh, it's Mandela, by the way, Nelson Mandela. Mandela. When a large group, a large group of people have a vivid memory that's all the same, but it's false. Like there's a large group of people that had a memory of Nelson Mandela dying in prison, but he obviously didn't die like the barons teens.

Speaker 3:          01:23:27       That's exactly where I was going with that. Like it's come back around. I know it's been talked about before, but it's come back around recently and now they're saying that we live in parallel roads and stuff. What it is just the Shel Silverstein. I mean, I explained that last time, you know, we, Shel Silverstein came out the same time as Bernstein and everyone thought or Berenstain it and everyone just put the two together thinking it was the same Steen and we just, it's just a memory. It's especially for a word that's, that, that's an odd word. Berenstain is odd. But Baron Steen is pretty common. Yeah. There's deep reddit posts about it now. And there's a top theory is that someone's gone back in time and change. Exactly. Shel Silverstein, dude, people waste so much time. Some fucking dude was tweeting me yesterday about the flat. I looked up, oh my God, this guy is, this is, I don't normally do this, but uh, I couldn't help it in this.

Speaker 3:          01:24:16       This guy tweets me. I was weird at first, but Eric Dubay has some compelling arguments supporting flat earth that can't be explained. So I tweet back in all caps. No he doesn't. And then he tweets me. Have you extensively looked into his research? First of all, if you're a fucking guy that's making youtube videos about the earth being flat, that Shit isn't research. It's just not, it's not real. You're not a scientist. You're not wearing a lab coat. You don't work for a major university just because you get some fucking jack off alone in your room, obsessing about nonsense. That's not research that said, so have you extensively looked into his research? There's definitely some fuckery going on with most of the ISS footage. So, which I quote, I wrote back in all caps. Uh, no he doesn't. I know it isn't, or no, there isn't. No, there isn't. No, there isn't a fuckery. And then I just, I stepped back and just watch the comments. The comments are amazing. There are so fucking amazing people actually arguing for the flat earth people arguing against the flap. You know who one of them is? My Buddy Max. Happily.

Speaker 3:          01:25:29       Did you see it or did you guess? I follow him on Facebook. I couldn't believe it. I saw my friend Justin, uh, texted me about it. He goes, dude, I shit you not max is arguing that the earth is flat. I called Max's nuts. He's so nuts. Earth picture thing too. There was pictures like that same thing. Got, he was talking about the other day about where all the pictures from Earth. Oh God, it hurts. It hurts. It hurts. Did they not know that snipers actually have to take into account the curvature of the earth when they're shooting people?

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       Because the ball, the bullets will drop. Like there's a curvature of the earth like you have to theirs. That's a part of the calculation when you're trying to shoot somebody fuckers like, God dammit, there's this shit to think about. And then there's that man. Yeah, man. Well, people love to fucking get worked up about nonsense. You know, like I, I posted about a fucking Cecil the lion I posted today about the fucking lion that killed the guy on the photographic safari thing. So I put this on Facebook, I go align killed a safari guide in the same park where Cecil was killed. The Safari guy had a name and was loved by the locals. The line was not in all caps authorized to kill that person. I hope to all other lines do the right thing and protest. I'm just fucking around. And then I step back and watch the God damn fights that are going on in the comments section where people, first of all our thinking, I'm an asshole because I, I'm serious, Joe, you're smarter than that.

Speaker 1:          01:27:08       You should know. First of all, it reached 1.8 million people in the two hours we've been doing this podcast. How the fuck that happened? But uh, Joe, you're smart. We talked in person before. Lions are designed to kill, they have line breaks. We shut the fuck up. Stupid. You're trying to sell sound smart. You think? I really think that that line should have killed them. I am glad. Let me tell you this right now. If there's a guy that's on a fucking photographic safari and align takes him out, I'm glad you know why? Because I've been on the four or five at four in the afternoon. We could use less people. We could use less people, and anybody that's willing to go on a fucking photographic safari, you're an asshole. If you want to go on a photos, photographic safari in the place where lions live, you ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          01:27:54       You've watched too many movies and for the sake of mankind, you probably should get taken out so everybody else could see. Oh, okay. They're just lions. These aren't lines that are in a movie. These aren't lines from a book. These aren't lines from a cartoon. There are giant cats, big fucking cats. I got a little cat at home and I take little things. I crumple up a piece of paypal and I throw them across the floor. She chases him, dives on them and puts them in her mouth and she's a fluff ball. She's a cat. These are 600 pound cats that regularly kill shit all day. They kill things. They're hardwired to kill anything that's limping, anything that's weak and it's in front of them, including some stupid fuck with a camera walking. You should be in an iron man suit and should be armed to the Dick that you should be.

Speaker 1:          01:28:45       If you're going to walk around where lions are, it should be, you should be like mocking them. You should be in one of those, not the regular iron suit, but the big one where the dude's inside of it. The big fucking gray one that they had. Yeah, the whole killer iron man's suit. That's what you should be in. Did you see fantastic for? Of course. I'm not seeing anything when they have kids. Yeah, they redo it and I was like a young black kid. That's the flame. Stop with your diversity and okay, I saw the fucking comic book. You know blade was black. The flame was not black. You're making them black. I know what you're doing. Okay, stop. It's like Annie Black, Annie, Annie. It's just make a new one, man. I'm not against black superheroes. Make a new one. But when you say the Superman's black, I'm like, come on, come on.

Speaker 1:          01:29:34       He's not black. Are Not doing that, are they? They are now. Someone was going to, yes, he should be. Do you remember when they were saying that Santa Claus, they were doing a black Santa Claus and Megan Kelly got really mad on Fox TV. Do you ever see that? Oh, I remember that. People are so mad at her because she's like, she made it. She was like, there was a video, you know on Fox TV where she would say Santa clause is not black. Okay, let's just get it over with. Santa clause is not black. No, Santa Claus is not real. You flog. Okay. That's the correct thing. You should have said. Not that he's not black. That's hilarious. Saint Nick, but first of all, she's right. It's not a lot of black people in Siberia, you know? But you know who is black? Jesus. It makes more sense. Yeah. He was black. It fucking skin of bronze and hair of wool hit here. What? Like lamb's wool and the skin was black. He was Sephardic. He was a dark person for sure. It did. Definitely didn't look like that hippie. Let's let it play it. Let's listen to her

Speaker 11:         01:30:35       in, they have a piece, uh, on.com in Santa clause should not be a white man anymore. And when I saw this headline, I kind of laughed and I sound this isn't, you're so ridiculous, yet another person claiming it's racist to have a white Santa, you know? And by the way, for all your kids watching at home, Santa just is white, but this person has just arguing. Then net, maybe we should, we should also have a black son. She's lying to your kids what he is and just so you know, we're just debating this because someone wrote about a kid's. Okay, why don't you get that?

Speaker 1:          01:31:03       She's got like, she's giving safe where the kids, just in case any kids are listening, Santa Claus is white, white kids. Listen, Santa Claus is white. That's ridiculous. Show me a picture. How long ago was that? Show me a picture of this fucking Santa Claus. He's white

Speaker 4:          01:31:20       two years ago. Two years ago. Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:31:22       She's hot though. She does. Everyone want to save the kids. Kids are Kinda smart or at least they think they are way smarter. It is important to save the kids when it comes to say, Jamie, you don't know cause you don't have kids. I'm like, precious little babies need to be lied to. They need to be lied to about Santa. You can. Kelly's going to lie to them. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:31:41       I know this kid, he, he gets bullied all the time and he was, and I actually got to see the bully bully on the playground a couple of months ago. Yeah. And uh, he was, and I was telling him like, you know, you should get him back and I, and he goes, Hi am I am? And uh, we made a plan where we Photoshop, we found a photo of the his bullae and we photo shopped him kissing another kid that's another bully. And then when we printed out a bunch of them and then put them all around the playground, right. But it's so cool nowadays with like, like these kids like he was like, when I was 11 I never thought about doing crazy things like that to get back to boy I just hid it or something like that. But nowadays kids are so advanced that even when, when when dealing with bullies, they're using technology. I love it to be careful though. The kid doesn't find out who did it and beat the shit out of him.

Speaker 1:          01:32:36       Problem. Yeah man. Fucking why is it a natural instinct for people to do that to little kids? It's a natural instinct, right? Like this is like for those big kids to pick on little kids, it seems like almost like a natural instinct. It's a fucked up instinct because like if you're bullied, like bullying for me led me into martial arts and it, it helped me ultimately like that fear of people kicking my ass led me to go and train and do martial arts. But for some people they don't do anything about it and they have like a particularly evil bull. I got my bullying was very gentle, nothing bad happened and nobody put me in the hospital. Nobody stole things from me or terrorized me. I just was scared to certain kids and certain kids fuck with me and I avoided them. Like I'd see them in the hallway and a gold the other way.

Speaker 1:          01:33:27       I'd try to find another way to get to the bus in order to go away all the way around and look around the corner, make sure that certain kid that was, that I was scared of wasn't there, but it was fairly mild as far as bullying goes. But we all know somebody who's like beaten up by bullies. That chick can change your life, man. It could devastate your confidence. It could ruin your whole year. It could lead to depression, it could lead to a drug use like, and I don't know what the fuck can be done for that other than I've always suggested that teaching kids martial arts and school would be a great way to avoid bullies because avoid bullying because they would develop confidence and they would develop discipline and they would understand that. That kind of shit is pathetic. That running around and beating on kids like this kid that you're talking about,

Speaker 4:          01:34:15       they actually not only do in the 19 martial arts in school, they actually did the opposite of doing things like kickball or games, uh, where they're actually kind of promoting bullying. What's the one where you, we all had the lineup on the ball, dodge ball. It's like great, you're teaching dodge ball, which is hurting other people, but instead we could have learned karate or whatever stuff. Fucking avoid dodge ball like the plague because I was in when I was 14 was the only time I remember dodge ball. Well,

Speaker 1:          01:34:44       but this is like before I started, marshal was kind of just starting karate and uh, I was scared of everybody beat my ass. You know, there's, I didn't, it was new in this neighborhood, just moved there. It was my first year in this neighborhood as a freshman in high school. And then there's just fucking kids that were lighting kids up with these balls, man. Just fucking whipping these balls at kids and they'd get hit in the face and everybody would laugh. And I'm like, this is crazy. Dodge balls. Fucking crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:35:13       And choosing partners. Remember you had to choose. We are the lineup. I Want Jeff on my team. I went and taught at my team and then just having to go through being cherry picked the last you remember that there's so much fucked up shit that they go, they do to you as a young kid that you don't realize that it's teaching you like is your place in life. Yeah. Like your first place, your second place. Sorry you came in last place. Now we're going to throw a ball at you. Come Gladwell.

Speaker 1:          01:35:39       He's got a book called out about um, outliers about people that perform really well and things. And one of the things that he brought up in this book was how important being successful is being born and a certain date at a certain time. A certain time of the year. Because if you're born at a certain time in the year, you missed the cutoff and you're older than the other kids in your class. And so like they were talking about like hockey players and that something about like there's like you know, x amount of players, a huge percentage of them were born later, like a rule or something. I think in Canada, like if you're born on January 1st and December 31st you're playing with this group or that group and you could be the oldest kid or you could be the youngest kid actually if you're born on the 31st all your friends of the day after you in another league.

Speaker 1:          01:36:28       Yeah. So if you're one of those kids that's like nine months younger than the other kids that are the, you know, they're all 12 right? But one kid is like nine months older or 10 months old. That's fucking significant. Really significant when it comes to sports. And his theory is, and it's, it's really correct that the advantage that those kids have by being older leads them to get better as well. Like one of the things about Jujitsu, this is a very important lesson for anybody who knows Jujitsu because a lot of people don't like this aspect of Jujitsu. Some people have this meathead idea that the way to get good at Jujitsu is to go against the hardest guys. Get your ass kicked. And that's how you learn. Actually. That's the wrong way to learn. The best way to get good at Jujitsu is to strangled blue belts.

Speaker 1:          01:37:15       You go and you find people that are just learning, but they're not as good as you and he choked the fuck out of them. That's how you get really good at your technique. And people say, well, that's bullying. Well, it is important for the blue belt too. At some point, spar with black belts, it is important because when the board, purple belts are blump brown belts because you need to know that there's a higher level of proficiency, there's a higher level of skill, and then there's a shorter distance in between points that these guys are hitting. They're there, they're cutting the chase, they're getting there, they're capitalizing on very small openings and they they clamp down and when they capitalize on these small openings, they, they get submissions quicker. So you have to know that there are guys that are better. That's important. But to drill, the most important thing is drilling.

Speaker 1:          01:38:02       And when you drill, you drill with like someone of your level and you just practice on each other like you choked me and you know, you'll do it like twice and I'll choke you. I'll do it twice. And it's just practice. And maybe you'll resist like 50% like sometimes like when you're doing a drill, and I'll pretend to be resisting resisting a little bit. So the strangle me and chuck, because that simulates real life simulates how it would be in, in, you're supposed to be building your muscle memory. But the real way to do it, the after you do that to get it really sharp is to practice on people with a limited amount of proficiency just to choke the shit out of him. So that's like the way that you ultimately get better is to practice on people that aren't quite as good as you.

Speaker 1:          01:38:43       And then you eventually develop and the, you get to a point where, you know, that seems kind of impractical, you know, but I don't remember what my point was. I'm choking people, sports going against different belts. A kid teaching bullying. Oh, uh, getting better. So the, the, the idea by that is, the real problem with that is if you're in a school and say you're the only white belts and everybody else is a brown belt or a black belt and you're training with them, fuck man, you might not ever get good. Like you just might get wrecked all the time. And that's the idea with kids that are in sports that are so much younger than everyone else in their class. Or if you're pretentious and they bring your precocious and you, they bring you in a class earlier, he skipped a grade. So you're in seventh grade now, Billy.

Speaker 1:          01:39:35       Well, you got to go to seventh grade football. Good luck. You little fuck. You're going to get run over. What am I to one of my best friends growing up the whole time we were playing sports, uh, his birthday's a week after mine, but he's a whole year older than me. And so he played sports with us the whole time. He's smaller than me and doesn't look like he's bigger than all of us, but he would beat the shit out of every single person. We would play every sport, football, basketball, baseball, track. When we were, when we got the high school, for some reason he was better than everyone in that too. He was a ninth grader and he was starting freshman running back on the Varsity team and the newspaper getting a, but he was a whole year older than everyone and ah, well that's what it is. 15 years ago.

Speaker 1:          01:40:15       No one was really, yeah. Well that's, that's a big deal because your, your body develops like very rapidly at a young age. And so these young kids that are older than everyone else in their class, they have this significant advantage and that advantage according to Gladwell, it accelerates them onto success as a professional that because you have an advantage, you continue to get better and you can exercise that advantage over other people, which sharpens your skills. Just like, you know, the idea of taking, you know, getting really good because you're strangling blue belts. Not good for the blue belt, but it's good for you. You know, cause you're already ahead of them so you're going to get better and better and better and better. I always back in third grade when my parents got divorced and I was a little young and uh, it didn't help me at all, but she didn't try.

Speaker 1:          01:41:03       He didn't even try. Like what sports, did you ever play soccer? Did you play soccer? How much did you try on a one to 10? Three. I hated it. I don't remember. Yeah, that's a difference. Um, I was born in August. I don't know if that's a good, I don't think that's a good month for professional sports. Like if you wanted to go on teams, but I didn't do it. I mean, I only played baseball when I was little until I found martial arts. But if, uh, I wanted to be a professional athlete, like a soccer player or a hockey player or whatever, probably not a good month. I think the the good months or like February or something like that, February, March and the season starts usually like, well you're also like wait late in the year. You know though I don't, I forget what they said, what year it was, what, what Gladwell said, what year was the or what the time of year rather was the best to start.

Speaker 1:          01:41:49       Who is an interesting thing too. He had a thing talking about what the best year to be born was like in the 20th century and it was like in the early 1930s cause it was right after the depression was over. And like right after World War One. So like there was a lot of jobs to be had. The economy was booming and then you were at the front of the line for like this big baby boom that came on after that before World War Two. So you would be in positions of management, you would have these advantages. It's really interesting when you think about like how lucky you can be or how unlucky you can be in certain situations and how that like we're talking about bullying can sort of flavor your whole life. I can unlucky roll of the dice can flavor your whole life and also he was talking about people that were born and that went through world war one and he was like, well even if you went through it by the time you were out of the military, by the time you're trying to establish your life, you already in your forties like you are.

Speaker 1:          01:42:50       You already like trying to start a career at the time where most people are already clearly established. Really interesting when he really stopped and think about like most of us don't engineer our lives. You sort of just make the best with what you're, you've got, but there's a lot of consequences. There's a lot of factors that play on behind the scenes that we really don't take into consideration. When you consider, when you really think about like where you are in life, I mean hard work and dedication and focus, all those things are hugely important. Um, the, the ability to stick with something, the ability to put in the work to get up disciplined, but also there's a lot of shit that you don't have anything to do with man that absolutely factors in. But then there's that bitch as part of people that go, well, he was the only fucking, you'd go up there because look, he, you know, he's only playing football for the fuck of Dodgers are the Dodgers. He talks about Bill Gates and his 10,000 hours of mastery and whatnot. But a lot of what he's talking about here is that he got lucky, whatnot because his

Speaker 12:         01:43:52       childhood home was really close to the University of Washington, get access to some computer programs that other people might not have had the opportunity to get ahold of. True. So he might not have been Bill Gates without being in the spot. He was at the time he was

Speaker 1:          01:44:05       true. But he might've been something else too. I mean it's also what he did. Like Bill Gates used to work from like two o'clock in the morning until four o'clock in the morning until six o'clock in the morning coding. His mother would try to wake him up and he was always exhausted. She couldn't figure out why because the dude was up all night coding, just having to work while she would put them to bed and even like pretend to sleep. Then he'd wake up, he'd sleep for a couple of hours and then get up and code. And I think that the people that become successful for the most part, they become successful because they figure out a way. But would they have figured out the same way? Would they have figured it out in another way or would they have been discouraged because of poor circumstances? You know how many people who became successful guts like take me for example.

Speaker 1:          01:44:46       I'm not maybe with standup because standup is like something you either just can do or you can't do and you have to put in the work and I don't see any easy roads for stand up. If you get good at stand up and your headline and in killing you put in the work. There's just no other way around it. But it's TV wise, I got lucky as fuck. I only auditioned for two TV shows ever and I got both of them. It's crazy. Total dumb luck. Got on MTV half hour comedy hour because of stand up. Then I got a development deal. The development deal led me out the Hollywood where I um, they Disney Disney gave me a bunch of money and I auditioned for a show. Just got total dumb luck. They were looking for some athletic guy to be in this baseball show. Got that. Then audition for news radio.

Speaker 1:          01:45:32       Got that two shows, both of them onto just total luck. Unquestionably lucky as fuck. And then even fear factor. Lucky as fuck. They wanted someone who had already been on TV, they wanted someone who understood competition and they wanted someone who was like a comedian that could like work on the fly. Look, here I am. Dumb luck. So those things I will never a total dumb luck. But also you got to fucking show up. You got to do the audition, you got to not choke. Like there's non luck factors as well. Like there's certainly luck involved in everything that happens, but there's a lot of other people that were trying to offer that same show that were probably just as qualified as me, especially with the first show. And they didn't get it cause they probably choked. Maybe my luck was that I had gone through martial arts competition so I was less likely to choke because I had done scarier shit. So I was used to performing under pressure. So maybe there was luck in that luck in the fact that I had this background. But that's not necessarily luck either cause that was fucking hard to do. So it's like this black and white thing that people want to put into. You know when you look at like this guy succeeded because of hard work. Well maybe, maybe he succeeded because of hard work and what time of the year he was born and that he was older than the other kids in his class

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       and he worked hard and he got there. There's a lot of factors. There's a lot of fucking factors in everybody's success.

Speaker 2:          01:46:59       There's a new drone Bretta type at Sony, uh, just released and it can go, uh, up to, uh, it can carry up to 22 pounds of cargo and it can go up to a hundred, six miles an hour,

Speaker 3:          01:47:13       uh,

Speaker 2:          01:47:14       and fly up to two hours. How many bullets does that? But there's a really cool video that I sent you, a gym that, uh, it's showing it fly and it looks like a mini airplanes unlike the drones that we know of where it's, they're usually like circular or, or like a square or something like that. This looks like a little mini jet.

Speaker 3:          01:47:36       Uh, but, uh, I thought it was interesting because it can carry up, you know, 22 pounds is a lot to 40 or something to carry. You know, it's interesting like, look at the way that thing just took off and how come they can't make plans like that? They did. They have plans like that. But I mean, for people like, not just like for jets, like for fighter jets, like, look at the whole front end of that thing. Why can't they fill that up with fucking passengers and have that big circle in the center be that, that a helicopter thing that makes it just take off straight. That's pretty dope.

Speaker 2:          01:48:06       There's another video below it that shows a little bit more of it flying.

Speaker 3:          01:48:12       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:48:14       But they're thinking about they're selling this so it could be used for like, you know, like Amazon and stuff like that and pizza deliveries and things like that.

Speaker 3:          01:48:23       How's it going to be a real problem, man? It's going to be a real problem for amateur pilots for sure. I mean, if, if they fill the skies, if they become so many of those things, I mean, think about if these things become as common as, I mean it probably won't, but a cell phones and they're just flying around all over the place. People were sending people things. Hey Man, can I borrow your baseball? Sure. I'll fly it over to you. Program it NBC. This was this, uh, this is an Ohio, right? This was a second one that just happened. Arrests on drone plot to surprise supply. Prison contraband. Oh God. This is a Maryland, I believe. Yeah, Ohio just had one off where people were smuggling in drugs and to like courtyards and stuff like that. Why they got caught because the wrong people got the drugs and there was a fight. Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:49:13       Look, guns, guns and prison. That's hilarious. They were smuggling and guns are those things. POKEMON cards. Well, what are they going to do when people start smuggling in three d printers and they can just build whatever the fuck they want in jail. Like I said, hey, that is that. It might be tobacco. That was the most of what they had on that other one. Those little things are tobacco. Could be packets. That's what this is on top. Who cares what it is? Just the idea that they can just fly it in and drop it off. Did you hear about the Pokemon convention? You was it yesterday. I get the newsletter. I'm part of the fan club. Of course. No. There was two gunmen that came into a Pokemon convention with 250 rounds

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       or something like that. Body over 18 dies. Yeah. Look at it as Pokemon at. I mean, who attacks Pokemon people? They're like the most adorable, nicest people in the world. But yet, look at that.
