You want to talk to him? Coc and sort the phone. He's probably fucking up somebody transmission. Was you transmission specialists? No, he's a, he's a fake ass mechanic. A fake. A fake mechanic who tell you he knew so he doesn't really know he's doing here. Come back. He'd say you fix cars were really don't. I mean he ain't went to school for it. He just be trying some shit. So he just fucks around. He fixed my car. One time I had a um, I had an SUV. I Montero so I needed a head job. So he told me with the spot plus kept jumping out the engine. So that jumped out of and you know, they kept coming out because they needed to.

Speaker 1:          00:51          He had stripped the um, the heads on my car. So instead of saying, Hey, I fucked up here, your heads, you know, you need to get a hedgehog. This boy went on my back porch, got my bobby q bachelor, broke that bitch out, stuck it in the engine and screwed that gasket back down. So I was like, the car still running ragged it, so I was like, fuck you. You taught my $300. I go to the dealership dollars. He took a barbecue spatula. She's attached to. You're lucky it didn't explode. He said, look, I pull up to the dealership. I'm not lying. And the man take the thing. And he said, ma'am, who put a barbecue spatula and your engine? I said, that motherfucker ain't charge you $300 to put up a barbecue spatula, barbecues bachelor. That cost me $200. You know what? I'm real long fire. Yes, yes. He broke that bitch and stuck it in my end. Jot is ridiculous. And I was like, why didn't you do that motherfucker? He was like, I was trying to keep your spark plugs in your engine.

Speaker 1:          01:51          Did he learn anywhere? Did he go to school? He's getting better. He's getting better. No more specialist. He's a. he's at the point when you can trust him with an oil change and oil change. Oh, I will trust my daughter with an oil train. No, just him because he was leaving the heart. Just a courts. This is where they go. I'll fucking art design. Yeah. But he is horrible. Oh my God. That's hilarious. He's learning. He's handled. Draining. Where does he do it? All? In and around. He got a mobile business. A mobile business. As soon as he fuck up your car. He changed his. No, he doesn't. He really got three. Anthony's in here. Oh fucking hilarious. So you just fucked up people's cars. Changes his number and just gets ghost. Well again, you know, my wife's a psychiatrist, she, she's dealt with all this kind of stuff and she laughed.

Speaker 1:          02:53          She just cracks up because she sees it. She sees it immediately. And just like her way of dealing with insanity is laughter and is she works with what she's worked with all sorts of people, but her sort of specialization is loony bin like one flew over the cuckoo's nest kind of scenes. Right. I, I remember going in with her the first time I visited her at work, she was running a mental hospital with like double doors and bars over the windows, these criminally insane people who had killed their kids and you know, like crazy shit. Right. And we went in there and I wasn't prepared, man. We went in and it was just like lunatics and there was this woman like must've been in her mid fifties lying on her back in a little nightgown. No underwear her with her, like arms and legs, you know, like a crab doing a crab thing and we walk in like this, you know, pussy in the whole scene.

Speaker 1:          03:49          Just scared the shit out of me and just started laughing like, yo crazy old lady, what are you doing? Get up from there. She just like last. And the thing that I didn't understand until I, I hung out with her is that people who are psychotic, no, they're psychotic. And so they kind of know how ridiculous they are. And as a doctor, when she laughs, she laughs in such a loving, accepting, I get you kind of way that it creates this instant rapport and they start laughing. Oh. So it relieves a little tension, right? Like it's all okay, I know you're just another crazy person. I deal with you all the time and come on, it's, it's Kinda like how, you know, like a, a gynecologist I imagine would have to sort of be so laid back that you kind of, you know. Okay, he seen a million pussies. I like, it relaxes you in a way, you know, I think she does that with, uh, with crazy people. It's normal people who make her really uncomfortable. Oh yeah. I mean, imagine if you were a gynecologist and you were super nervous about seeing someone.

Speaker 2:          04:57          Okay. I guess we're about to do that. Hold on the of modern my face. Let me have a little more wine. Just another days off that's happening. Let's see what you got wrong down there. I'm looking, I'm looking, going to use a mirror. I like. It's like it's a fucking vampire Medusa. You can't look in the eyes.

Speaker 3:          05:19          Do you remember back in Boston? You were out one night with Jennifer and I was home and I swear to God on my father's grave, this happened. I rented Batman, the blockbuster and I put it in and I'm sitting at home and I'm watching it and then all of a sudden I see this shadow and then I turn my head and I see another shadow and I look up and there's a bat flying around the apartment and I'm like, what? And I'm scared shitless of bats. Like, it's like my thing ever since I was a kid, my aunt had this bar near her and they had bats and they would be me. They were fruit bats and if they bite you you'll get rabies and you'll die. And, and so, and we would always be outside playing tag at night and I would fucking, bats would fly by and I'd freak out.

Speaker 3:          06:05          And, and so I'm alone in the apartment and as a bat flying around and Batman is on TV. And so, uh, all I knew is they go in your hair, which I think is like not even true. So I put on a baseball cap backwards and I had on sunglasses and a tennis racket. Some glad I didn't want them going in my eyes. He's going to go for. So I'm running around the apartment swinging at him. He's taken off. He's like, you know, he's just, they're erratic the way they fly it on a where they're fucking going and this goes on for like 10 minutes and then there's like a standoff and I'm waiting and then I hear you coming up the stairs and you came in and you open the door and you go, what the fuck? You do bad in here and you just, you just grabbed the tennis racket out of my hand and he walked up and he was in the window and you just bashed him once and he just went down and then you just walked over and you had taken your hand and just went into the kitchen.

Speaker 3:          07:00          Start eating it. I'm stay on sunglasses and I remember that. That's hilarious. That's hilarious. I probably wouldn't even killed it if you weren't already trying to kill it. I think you, you might. I call the animal people to come get it because it looked like it was stunned if he was actually dead, had been sick. Oh, you mean once I hit it? Yeah. No, it was. It was probably. I remember I told him. Yeah, I remember. I'm like, I'm not going to have this thing suffer. I don't remember what I did, but I remember it was some hitting involved. I'm pretty sure it was the tennis racket could have been. Yeah, you were fearless. I was like, fuck man, I don't like.
