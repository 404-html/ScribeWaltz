Legalzoom is a way of handling all sorts of things online that you would normally have to go to a law office and meet with a lawyer and pay a fuck load of money. Most likely. Instead you could do it at home, drunk and naked. You can be having sex and you could do it with a laptop. You could be giving head if you're so inclined. You could give head and then come up for air every now and then and fill out some forms.

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       I heard about legal zoom after they sponsored my podcasts and I, but way too late because I set up an LLC. It costs me $1,300 where you could have done it for like 100 bucks, 100 bucks. I mean you can do it for 99 bucks. You can set it, you can incorporate or set up an llc for 99 bucks. Someone told me you could do that free online or that is like a bunch of steps that you have to go through. Legal Zoom makes it way more convenient. It's just a hundred bucks. Fucking Weirdos. I get it. I get it. It's a lot of money, but it's way better than going to a a law office. Also. I'll law and by the way, I don't think that's. I don't think it's true. I don't think you can do it for free. I think you have to do a bunch of different things.

Speaker 1:          00:03:13       The way legal zoom has it set up. It's way easier. Fortunate they got, first of all, they got an a plus from the better business bureau. I love Shit like that so you don't have to worry about it. Plus I know a bunch of dudes, Aubrey, um, formed on it, the first llc for on it. That was all done through legalzoom. Brian, when incorporated desk won, that was done through legal zoom. Not Add 10 customers would recommend legalzoom after they used it. But you know what that means, that means it's awesome because we all know one of 10 people are just whiny cunt. That's complained about everything. So if you get nine out of 10, that's beautiful. If you really can make 90 percent. Everybody on the Internet loves to, loves to find anything to talk anything. God. If the aliens come and read our youtube comments, they're going to get right back in there fucking spaceship and fly away like this is just tough.

Speaker 1:          00:03:59       Called sucks is a cauldron of cunt. Anyway, with legal zoom, you can get a last will for 69 bucks. But. And also they can provide you with the third party attorney if you panic. That's a big one. So if you're in the middle of filling all this stuff, it was like, oh yeah, if I can do it, they can hook you up with an independent attorney so someone can figure it out for you. Cool. Yeah. Legalzoom is not a law firm, but they can connect you with a third party attorney and provide you with self help services. Anyway. Go there. Use the Codeword Rogan in the referral box at checkout and save yourself some cash son. Get it all together. Bitch. Last well for $69. That's so depressing. It's all the pressing death is depressing, but yet inevitable. And so the stunt, the sun itself has a billion years left and then we're fucked anyway.

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       Whatever, whatever on it.com. Oh, and it, if you've never have you used any of the onnit shit and we sent you anything. I don't know. My primal bell. Give me an address. I'll have it all sent to you. Men. Men. Yeah, please. Give me the dress. We have this new things, warrior bars there. Um, by the same people that made the Tonka Bar, which is a native American recipe of without any preservatives whatsoever. Mixing cranberries and buffalo meat. Each one of them has 14 grams of protein. It's no nitrates, no artificial flavors, no antibiotics, no nonsense. I'll be honest with four grams of fat. I hate it. And it was so good. It's fucking delicious. I gotta be honest. I feel like I'm in the Truman show right now. Was that? Have you ever seen that with Jim k product placement, but this isn't product place with him and you guys love this stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:05:35       It's fucking delicious. What was the. What happened in the Truman show with product? The Truman show where the whole world's watching Jim Carrey. Yeah. That's what the one where he is. She's like, try the nestle. Quik. It's delicious and refreshing and he's like, all right, matt it to the store. Well that was like, he didn't know. Right? He had no idea that he was the show since. Since a baby. I didn't see that. It's a mind for man. It's a mind. Fuck. You remember that Matthew mcconaughey show? It was a movie where they followed him around with a camera and he became really famous and we became like this huge disaster. It was called. Was it called? What? It was called MTV, MTV, MTV. That standard operational procedure on reality shows now like those are real and I watch every one of them. This was before any of that.

Speaker 1:          00:06:20       Tell them your favorite show. I mean, I don't know where to begin. Naked. Love naked and afraid. Let me just get through this audit thing real quick. Sorry. I'll send you some shit, man. I'll send you some shit. I'll send you a and I'll send you some primal belts with the bulletproof coffee because I make it myself. You know what I'm saying? Yourself and that's what I've been doing. What do you. What do you mean, like hookup with what? With the kind of coffee? Yes. See we found out this is a. We actually talked about the fungus came out some bullshit. Yeah. Well this is the deal. All right. I don't know. I can never. I don't. I don't want to speculate anybody's intention. So what I'll just tell you is the absolute facts. There have been cases where mycotoxins became an issue with coffee.

Speaker 1:          00:07:02       Those cases, most of them have been resolved by going through these mycotoxin issues and then rigorous testing and then figuring out ways to not provide an environment where mycotoxins are toxins and hopefully heard that and took it and ran with it. Good for you. Here's the issue here, but he stopped. He brought me. Unfortunately, he brought me in, unfortunately me because he was, you know, saying it on my podcast and I repeated it without any research. It used to be an issue and it can be an issue still if someone is not preparing coffee correctly, but it's like when you buy really good coffee, like there's a company called Rusty's Hawaiian delicious, delicious coffee. Their bags are rated by like coffee connoisseur, sores were professional coffee graders that will taste the coffee and check out various various beans and different roasts and then they grade it, but they also tested for mycotoxins.

Speaker 1:          00:07:58       Like if you have fungus in your fucking coffee, you get a really low score. Fungus on my roast. They figured out a long time ago. First of all, this is where it gets really weird. That coffee was originally established in Ethiopia, which is a dry climate and all these mycotoxin issues happened when they started moving them out at Ethiopia, put them in other places where there's moisture. Yeah, exactly. Growing them in different places. In California, wines have very few microtoxins, especially Okra toxin a, which is the big one because it's so dry, so they actually have very, very little of that. A very little issues with that. Yeah. Isn't that interesting? And corn as well. Corn, you know there's. There's a bunch of different mycotoxins. That's the point. If you buy really good coffee, which is most of you, what you buy, most likely you're not gonna have any issues whatsoever.

Speaker 1:          00:08:47       If you do have issues. According to Dr Rhonda Patrick, she was saying that even like above threshold doses of these mycotoxins even provide a beneficial reaction by your body that your body reacting to these mycotoxins that aren't necessarily like really bad for you in small doses, that your body might actually energize it's immune system in response so it might have some sort of a corresponding positive effect. This is obviously layman's terms. I'm a retard. I don't really even know what I just said. According to her, these things make sense. So what I'm saying is you can make that style of coffee like coffee with grass fed butter and mct oil. You can make that with almost any good and you're blending it or you're just. You're just stuff that you're drinking right here. Is that delicious? I don't ever plan. I just. Black coffee scoop of butter.

Speaker 1:          00:09:33       That's cool to t and start. That's fine too. I mean it's a little more. A little Stevia can use the packets though. This bottle. Oh yeah. A little too much in Jack. You if you only let, like a mist of Stevia is a plant extract zero. Zero sugar. You don't have to worry about it. No, not at all. I mean, it's probably like all things not great if you ate it all day, you know, even plants, I eat it all day. I feel great. Nine plants. Our plants are toxic. I mean quite a lot of their own tie. They keep people from eating them discouraged when people are like juicing lots and lots of leafy Greens. We'll do that. We'll do that again. About the rest of the commercial was just keep going. We don't have to play music. Fuck it. Just. I liked throwing one out like that over on a.com.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       Use the code word. Rogan saves money. Yep. Yeah. Um, so this is the point is that this, this, these toxins may or may not be an issue in some coffee today. They were at one point in time, but the coffee experts aren't worried about that. When you talked to coffee experts, they're all worried about taste and flavor and where they're grown and they're also worried about the fact that the climate in Ethiopia apparently is deteriorating because of global warming and they think within the next 50 years, like a good percentage of the species that only exists in Ethiopia will be extinct. Wow. Yeah. Because there's all of the coffee in the world comes from Ethiopia. Originally my brother told me about this and I was like, Hey, you realize in 50 years coffee is going to be no longer freaked out. I freaked out. Well, will start storing comp.

Speaker 1:          00:11:06       It'll be in Latin America, Costa Rica. Right. That doesn't also matter like when you roast them versus when you drink. That's another thing that issue that people have with this, uh, upgraded coffee. Although it's, you know, he's very successful at sells very well for whatever reasons. Um, so it's hard to keep on the shelf so it's constantly moving. So you're getting fresh coffee when you buying it. Caveman coffee roasts it when you order it, if you order caveman coffee when you're playing right? Tate Fletcher and really good coffee and tested mycotoxin free 100 percent. They tested it. They went through. They're getting everything single source from a grower. They know the guy, the guy's family lives in South America and he lives in Albuquerque, so they traveled back and forth to the farm. They know exactly where it comes from. It's as legit single source is. You can get keith

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       guardians a bad ass coffee, sweetie. He's just a great guy and he was a hell of a fighter, you know, and he still wants to go out and again, he's thinking one more time, one more time for Albuquerque when they're trained with them for a long time. Right on time. Yeah. Really good friend. He's an awesome guy. Just couldn't be a cooler guy and he's doing really well with this. This caveman coffee company. It's just they, uh, you know, him and tate are big coffee, banana and coffee take never goes anywhere without a fucking container of coffee. Like everyone else carries a thermos of coffee. He loves it. Always has. Ever since I've known him, I had a guy on my podcast, a what the hell? I can't remember. Sorry. Hey, he wrote a book called what? White people? No. And uh, and what white people do.

Speaker 2:          00:12:31       He started as a blog and he said one thing about white people, they are into their coffee man. Like, I love it. My coach Tony Jeffries was like, you're the only guy I know who drinks coffee in between rounds. I'll get a big, a big cup of coffee and drinking in between. Right. That's hilarious. You know, Tito told me that the coffee fucks with your cardio. He says he doesn't drink any. It doesn't take any caffeine. So Cardio fucks with your cardio. I've heard different. Now if your favorite says, I'm going to listen. No Shit. Tito Ortiz tells me that I was with Tito two days ago in a bar in by accident. Lori sat and he, it was his cheat day and he was drinking a Shirley temple, like literally in this really girly glass, so here's this giant to drinking a very, very pink drink. I was like, that's Hilarious, man. He had tremendous cardio. Tito's cargill to take Abbott Strength Coach tells me not to drink caffeine. I'm going to list. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 2:          00:13:27       There's, there's certain people you need to listen to what works for you man. His Cardio is insane. Crazy. That fight where, who was the fight where the guy got on his back? Well, within the first minute of the first round, like there was like solid, reliable, ramble able to Hilo, but that's obviously not him because apple tree hill is the bad ass. A welterweight that, that name stuck in my head. Well, let's just look it up. The Guy got right away. Right? And they're like, just exactly where your ride doesn't want to be tough. He's, he's been, he's been done it right. You know, like did you see that able to Hilo, Jamie varner fight. That was fucking insane. What a crazy slugfest slobber docker. Oh my God. I don't know why I thought why able to Hilo was my name was coming into my mind. I got to pull up the student's name to find out why that was. Oh, Uriel Contra. So it was just another cool name. Yeah. Brian Callen isn't it really? It's too much about, but the pace that uriah put on that. Uri, I'll contract guy. That's. I wish I was a little guy. If I was little. I mean I feel like I should be a member of team Alpha male. I love long distance running. I love eating healthy. I love dieting. I want to be a small guy. Well, you're very fit to for heavyweight. You have like some pretty extreme endurance for for a heavyweight. Do you say that like what's going today? Like with

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       a guy like Travis Brown or with guys like John Jones or yourself, you getting a lot of people that were athletes in other sports that were like high level athletes and then transitioned over into fighting. So in the beginning you're seeing like they're learning. They're really good athletes so they move quicker than most people. They usually have a little bit more physical explosion power than most people, but then it takes them awhile to get all the techniques down. Now we're seeing like a lot of those dudes, but this is that we're seeing Osp is another one opens. I would say a lot. I think we're seeing a number of them starting to transition, but the thing is, I know I've done with tons of nfl guys, Mba, when someone's trying to hit you in the face and you're just not. That's why it takes so long. I think for these athletes to adapt a fighting because getting hit in the face, it's just, it's just not either.

Speaker 1:          00:15:38       You were born where you're like, yeah, this is cool. I can live with this. I can learn. Learn to get out of the way and you know, put my life on the line. And then usually when guys are that good of athletes, like, forget this, forget this man, forget this, isn't it? I think, I think you look like at the UFC and guys starting to come around, but people think to me, you know, in 10 years we have all these freak athletes. You're not man, because he's freak athletes. It's very rare you get a freak athlete who's like, yeah, I'm going to go fight another killer in a steel cage. That's a very interesting point. It's a very interesting point when there's options to write, especially, especially when you're that good of an athlete and you're making way more money. Well, not necessarily. Not necessarily.

Speaker 1:          00:16:17       You know, it depends on what level you're fighting in the UFC, you know? I mean, if you're a guy will say about this all the time, like, oh, you guys don't get paid yet. I make a great living man. Yeah. It's not true. The first one. No, no, no. Hold up. You're talking about the. You're talking about the exception. I make more than a Lotta yes. Well, here's what you have to understand. When you look at pay, okay. Like there's pay that's listed like a. As far as like the purse that you get admission, they list out what your staff does not. That doesn't take into account a lot of factors. There's a lot of things that they want to remain private so you're. You're not just getting paid that amount. Some people are, some people are just getting paid that amount, but guys you don't know that probably should begin paid that amount, but when a guy is selling tickets, you know someone is a big name fighter.

Speaker 1:          00:17:05       There's a lot of factors in there is there's well incentives. Paperview pieces of paper for sure. Like George St Pierre was making $5,000,000 a fight. That's pretty good. Yeah. Let's make it a lot of fucking money and you know, he's got sponsors. You said Gatorade, all this other stuff. All this other revenue coming in and George St Pierre made a load of money fighting so maybe maybe it didn't make as much as floyd mayweather, but guess what? Floyd Mayweather. Floyd mayweather is one a bigger star to a better promoter. He's a fucking. That doesn't matter what a guide and there's that. Well, social UFC now use is pretty worldwide now, but it doesn't. You could be. There could be a spectacular fight in the UFC, a crazy epic fight that everybody wants to see. That could do one and

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       a half million, 2 million pay per view buys. That's what floyd mayweather is done. It is possible. That could happen. When you think about before Floyd Floyd Mayweather, it was. It's hard to find like a guy since Oscar de la Hoya, maybe manny Pacquiao a guy who can do like. There's only a few of those guys, like everybody wants to say, oh, in boxing they make so much more money. No, there's about five of. You have those guys. You're talking about the exception. People always refer to the exception mayweather Pacquiao or the exception. Look at the. If you watch this, this last fight with Bradley, look at the undercard. It was pure shit. It was horrible. Those guys are scrapping. I thought it was a good fight. I thought. I thought the undercard was pack. Y'all Bradley's pack your bag. That was good. That was a really good. There were some good fights in the undercard.

Speaker 2:          00:18:34       It wasn't bad. I enjoyed it. Who was your favorite on the undercard? Uh, I'd have to look at it. Exactly. That's my. That's my, that's my point. That's the problem with lots of no one gives a flying hoot about the underdog. No one just no one gives a shit because you don't know him. These guys are super talented and they're not making any money on time. You okay? Here it is. At a certain point in time, there's only so many fucking room room for so many fighters you can keep in your head. Put boxing, boxing. I mean, let's go. I mean, at heavyweight especially, you got clear. Listen, Klitschko could probably deliver pizza next door and no one's going to ask for an autograph. Isn't that weird? That's crazy, right? That's was so dominant that your heavyweight champ. No one gives a shit. That's so weird.

Speaker 2:          00:19:18       I find people were tweeting about the under under crowd. They were tweeting, being defensive about the, that the, uh, the uh, hbo commentators were being defensive about the quality of the undercard. So maybe you're right, I just tuned in and I may or may not have been high as fuck. So I had a good time. I was white boxing fall by the wayside. This isn't really. It hasn't. That's a misconception. It hasn't fallen by the wayside. It's just there's only a few guys that can sell big pay per view. Right. Like maybe you know, there's maybe like four or five guys that can sell. They don't. Tell me one story. Look at the UFC. There's a countdown. Every damn Tuesday. Wednesday on billy. Billy Billy's mom passed away and he decided to turn to fighting the UFC does the best job of marketing. It's guys. There was one fight that was actually really good vargas versus that.

Speaker 2:          00:20:10       A Russian cat. Yeah. That was a good fight. Yeah. They were both on the feeding. Yeah. That was good for. I was a very good. Again though, we're talking about that dude versus Russian. Do these motherfuckers, man, beast Russians that are making their way into mma now, making their way into boxing now. It's really fascinating how many bad ass Russians. It's just living in the area. Animals. Scary really well, it's also the epigenetics, you know, they're. They're saying that now that people who have had family members, this was something that's passed down through sperm. They believe traumatic events through your ancestry or passed down through sperm and people who are children, people who were the children's children and children of people who have survived traumatic disorders or traumatic incidents were more likely to develop all sorts of mental problems were more likely to be like schizophrenia, like all these, all these issues, mental issues that they could directly correlate possibly to the trauma that their ancestors have established.

Speaker 2:          00:21:12       Now think about how rude you are. If you're little, if your little kenny grown up in Malibu and you want to be a fighter, good luck competing with those guys over in Siberia. Yeah, no, I'm going to turn them back now. You're fucked man. Just forget it. We're just hungry. They have different jaws. They're just different. Look in there and playing. Grab ass with fricking Bruce Jenner. Meanwhile, this Guy Barry, a fricking wrestling. That is hilarious. Who's that? Who's that? Golovkin Khaled can congest triple g. he's the next big star. He's big, he's a fucking animal. He really is. Body shots. No one wants to fight them. I'll tell you what, I'm excited for the Sergio Martinez and Miguel. Miguel cotto has been looking very good and his last few fights and Martinez is almost 40 at a certain point and with his style, very different style than Bernard Hopkins.

Speaker 2:          00:22:03       You know, Bernard Hopkins, Forty Eight fucking years old. Crazy. Still out boxing the shit out of Sergio is all about footwork and some point during that footwork goes away. He's gonna get in trouble and his left, he's got a brutal, brutal lefthand and it's. He mean he comes in with everything. He's so good at his movement and his is in and out movement. He uses that same in and out movement to land but devastating. This is what we're talking about. Fear. So He's almost 40. He played soccer almost all his life and then got into boxing I think at 28. Twenty nine. No. Yeah, multi-time world champ. No matter when you start with your Tito Ortiz or veto for starting at 18, 19 year old or your Sergio Martinez started at 30, no matter when you start, your clock is ticking. You have this amount of fights in you.

Speaker 2:          00:22:49       No matter when. I mean, yeah guys drag it on, you know, via a fade or a cro. Cop guys are drag it on, but you're only going to be in your prime and you're going to have these many great fights in there. It doesn't matter when you start talking to eve Edwards about that. He's 37 now and he's, he's. He was saying one of the frustrating things for fighters I think is that you learn the art. You, you continue to learn. There's so much to learn, but you continue to learn and then you get to be 37, 38 and you may be a step slower but you know so much more so you just want to try it out. But the game is also timing and speed. And guess what? That's why it came about because those 37, 38 year olds are like, Dang, I know so much man, but my body's not the same.

Speaker 2:          00:23:28       Let me talk this doctor over here. Now we have epic. Dammit. Now we've got big data. It's not an episodic. It's an epic. No, you're right though. In Brazil, spinning back, kick in, people's faces off in Brazil. All T are teed up. Joe Silva said it best. He goes, it's like [inaudible] or downloaded a taekwondo black belt. All of a sudden thrown. We'll never, never to a wheelchair and then knocked out. Luke rockhold. Luke rockhold is a beast. I mean for him to do it with ease and then bisbing what? I think you nailed it. What you nailed is exactly what it is, is that these guys get older and they get so much more experienced, so much more knowledge, but that's the nature. Balance. Nature gives you that experience and knowledge so you can teach. It's like the two old. It's like the two old buffalo, the old buffalo in the young boy and a cat.

Speaker 2:          00:24:24       I don't know this too on the calf. The calf goes, what is it? Buffalo, the young girl, the young bomb y'all bought and the be buffalo. Let's go buffalo. Yeah. He goes, he goes, let's go down there. Fuck all those. Fuck one of those cow. No, no, no. You fucked it up already. Listen, this is what he says. Listen. He goes, let's run down there and fuck one of those cat. And the old bull says, let's walk down there and fuck them. All right. All right. This is the other thing though. When when these I get it to me and you were still going to fuck it up. Fuck, this is the thing though. Or bell form those guys. The sport wasn't as big when they were when they were superstars. Right? And now they're like, whoa, the sports huge. I can stick around and take this stuff and make all this money and be relevant.

Speaker 2:          00:25:13       You know what I'm saying is there's vituro show that again, Jamie, look at this. Look at this. Oh, that's not just doing that. It's doing that to luke rockhold. Who's better looking in Brendan Shop? Maybe easy. Now, let me tell you some muscles on his teeth really does. Let me tell you this though. Luke rockhold flew for 17 hours from San Jose, California, showed up on a Saturday night. Got We'll kicked in the face and jump back on a plane. That's got to suck. It does suck. I thought. No. Garren Brazil. Can you tell Joe to the story about the other stuff? Are you allowed to about which one? What other stuff? Money Jersey. Oh yeah, for sure. Tell us why, but they're secret. They're not really for sure. Quit eating those nuts because that's fucking fucked up my whole game. Yeah, stop all that. Before we tell any story, I want to go back to this trt thing because we can't just gloss over it like that.

Speaker 2:          00:26:09       No, no. It's a huge subject. I think you nailed it though too, and you did too. Talking about Eve Edwards feelings of all the knowledge he's acquired these. That is. That does seem to be like nature's balancing act, right? Yeah. Like nature doesn't want you to have all that knowledge and all that and live forever. It's like God saying, no, you got it cool. Oh, your body sucks. You can't do it anymore. Well, it's sort of like the beauty of everything is that it's temporary. Like what's, what's our favorite thing? Let's be realistic. Sex. Most people's favorite thing. It's sex. When you're really horny and you're having sex with someone who you really like having sex with, it's one of the greatest things on earth. One of the great things about, as you know, it's not gonna last you got, look, if you're a seller, did you're great.

Speaker 2:          00:26:50       You'd be bored of it. That's why guys do drugs and stuff. See, this is the people are freaks and they're just fucking. Their pupils are this big and then they never opened the fucking curtain. Those people are taking the same concept with sex. He's like, man, Yo would make this even better if we did molly on this. Yeah, well those same differences like fighting, but you know, it'd be better if I did steroids, so this is a good point because the molly thing, if you do it on molly when all that stuff wears off, which it will wear off eventually you are because you, you're in debt, you're like a kid with a student loan. Like you started out of the gate, like you're not belonging to us on sesame street. Just super dally paid way more than you have. It's like seeing what you see.

Speaker 2:          00:27:32       Those people who are just like, they're now they're 53 hanging around a coffee shop with a ponytail and really have a job to try and try and get things out and you're like, oh, you had a really good time for 15 years. That's the same with fighting some fighters. I'll meet some fighters who are so punchy and there may be 40, 45 for 15 years. This guy was the man I wanted to be him. Now I look. I'm like, dude, you make me never want to fight again. What were you doing? Do you have a number in your head where like you're, you're, or a place in your head where you're going to reach, where you're like, that's it, whether it's an age number or whether it's a physical number, does a gut feeling that you're gonna have when you know, when the hanging out?

Speaker 2:          00:28:12       I think, you know, I think you know, but do you know the problem people ask me this now, people you know, when do you think, you know, I probably say I have a good five years left, especially the way I train. Right? Brian, you know I don't have an off season. I'm in shape year round. I trained nonstop around year round. Do you do that to continue with your improvement or do you also do that in case someone calls, like in case you get a last minute justice just to get it, just to get better, just to get better. Continuing to improve. The only reason he's always dressed well, amen. If that's the right attitude to have in the hurt business, you know you can't be casual about their monsters out there. And that's Mark Hunt. I just called out Mark Hunt, you try and listen to this.

Speaker 2:          00:28:53       He talks shit to me on twitter at 10:00 at night, which is whatever time in New Zealand, it's 10:00 and I read it like a whatever. I'm watching naked and afraid or teen mom or some bullshit, right? I'm like, whatever. Sitting there, it's just killing me. I'm like, fuck this guy back on that. I talked to him. He bikes, we're going back and forth. Finally it was almost like, you know, like butter. It just Bam. Next thing I know I had him agree to a winner. Takes all fight and will fight in an August winner takes all market, Brenden's shop main event. You're having a winner. Takes all fine. It was my idea. So how does that work? Like financially? Like as far as like with the UFC, the UFC won't sanction it. Okay. So him your purse when he's going to pay me his porsche perse, but. Oh okay. Yeah, that's what I meant. I was just say like Mike

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       and I, you know, it's just a proper way. But the thing is you get all hyped up. I had done with that sitting in bed, my heart's going a million miles an hour. I just called out the whatever, number five, six heavyweight in the world, the hardest hitter in the division, and it's a winner. Takes all fight, not announced asleep. You know what I'm saying? Seven am went to practice. No pressure. No pressure. That that was a Wednesday night and you want to be a UFC fighter? Fuck yeah. The pressure's probably alien to most people couldn't even fight week. What? Fight Week. Depression. You think about all the other avenues you could have gone down to avoid jumping into that cage for sure. When you add everything goes through your mind when all the other avenues in life like, yeah, for sure. I should be married with kids. I can be wearing a suit and tie.

Speaker 3:          00:30:30       Got I got. I'm a double major from history. Colorado could be doing this. I should've done this. I could've done this blending. Is that. When does that go away? When does that go away? A man pray, right? Right, right. When I get in the cage, when I hit the Kratom cool. In the back I'm like, Hey, what are we doing? So once you hit the crowd then you like, it's on your load and your body can relax and at least it's going to get a release from all this tension. Yeah, isn't that what it is? It's like once the first round starts, people would think like, God, it must be scary to fight, but I would imagine that the most brutal thing is just getting the buildup. This building. Oh, when? When? When you're fighting. You know, in my last fight I was the Komen men or second, third fight.

Speaker 3:          00:31:12       In Toronto you'll see one 65 million summitry own. I mean we didn't fight till 9:00 at night. You're waiting around all day thinking about the fight and when do you eat? It's tough for me because my nerves. That's why everyone's like go shop. She got two, two. Oh, five lists on 252 pounds. Right now the only reason I weigh in so lights because I can't eat, I can't eat. So that's why. Wow, that's crazy. I love reading because he gets, he's so honest about it. He calls out Alistair overeem on twitter at [inaudible] and he's like, he's like, he stops and he goes, hey, God told him that. He was like, I gotta go try and hit the ground running, man. Well, that's good though, isn't it? Yeah. So it was honesty, honesty, fear. Oh, people, uh, people all the time like, Oh man, you, chuck Ladell is not like that Broccoli.

Speaker 3:          00:31:57       I hate to tell you my man, your favorite fighters. Just scared to admit it. I'm not scared to admit you. You know, people are terrified back there. You're going to fight another train killer inside the octagon. Basically in your underwear in front of millions of people, millions of people. You can be a little scared. I hate to tell you that. I hate to tell you that man. I hate to tell her. How could you think to you when you're fucking cool hand? Luke was a good actor and he said, there's a very, there's a close relationship between fear and intelligence. He said, anybody who's not, who's not afraid at all, as is, I always go shake my head. I got that guy's not very smart. I'll tell you what, Ken Kenny told me this, tough fighters don't laughs. Last smart

Speaker 1:          00:32:39       fighters do, and he's right, man. That's totally right. He's so. He's so not hopkins. Back to Barnard hop, right? Forty eight years old in boxing and he talks clear. You know, I mean he doesn't have any insurance. Very rarely gets hit clean. Very rarely. He might get hit cleaned two or three times the same way, right? Very rarely use it. Last guy to hit him clean with sugar. Shane Mosley, sugar Shane Mosley rocked with a right hand and covered up, recovered them boxes. That instagram of sugar. Shane, between you and Tim Teebo, he looked like you guys want them in something like he's tiny. Tell you what he was. He was a tad punchy. I'm not gonna lie to you a little bit punchy floyd. No sugar. Shane. Oh, Jesus Christ. No. Yeah, I'm sure. Sugar. Shane's a little, little hunches. He sees Bradley is going to be punching.

Speaker 1:          00:33:26       I've never seen anybody. I've never seen him a take that kind of punishment. And do you think it's worth it? Joe, what about the prevent knockoff fights? Did you see that thing I've ever seen? He fought a fucking way. Max Kellerman described it. You took a Siberian caveman, thought them out and then put boxing gloves on them. That's what that guy had slurred speech for at least a month after. Yeah. He talked about it after the fact. So you guys have kids. Your kid wants to fight and they, you know, most likely there's going to be some trouble down the road with his brain. If he's a fighter, you say, cool. You say you do whatever you want to do, but that's what you want to do. You have to be. You can't have asset. You can't have. I don't want my kid to happen. I didn't say lazy. Muggy here.

Speaker 1:          00:34:04       If you want to do it, if that's what you want to do, that's what you should do. I don't think anyone should do anything other than that's gets to a certain point until, look, that's what I wanted to do when I was young. I wanted to fight. When I first figured out at a certain point in time, there was no future. That's when I stopped doing it. Well, I'm worried about bringing made you realize there is no fuel, nothing in 1989 when my hand, my last kickboxing match, there was nothing. There was no kickboxing, taekwondo. I couldn't respect it the way I used to respect it because I started kickboxing and I realized kickboxing, you start eating it. I fought above the waist pka style and then I started training more and then I realized like there was even more holes in the above the waist time, but above the waist pk style.

Speaker 1:          00:34:49       The. The real problem was the boxing there. I had done taekwondo for so long, like my, my hands were shit and my ability to like move and throw kicks and punches together. It was all disjointed. It just wasn't the right way to do things. Then when did you get into Jujitsu? Ninety six. It was, yeah, it was. Y'All caught me at it. So I, I went through this period where I was training like all the time in a martial art that had all these holes in it, so I wasn't ever going to go back and compete, like try to make the US Olympic team or anything like that because I didn't feel the same way about taekwondo. I didn't want to just do it anymore because I knew how easy it is for a guy just cover up and walk you down and corner you in a, in a ring and fuck you up because you don't know how to deal with hands. It's just there was so many holes in it. So it's so much easier to punch you in the face when a guys were

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       throwing kicks and punches together and you didn't understand like the rhythm and the distance of punches. So when I went from that, like I had no choice, there was no options. But if there was an option, like if kickboxing paid, like what boxing does, if there was a UFC option at that time I would have had to learn grappling. So I probably still wouldn't have competed in the UFC. If there was something like that, like when I first started, uh, grappling when I first started Jujitsu in [inaudible] 96, I was amazed at how easy it was for mended, just raped me. Just ragdoll me, choked me, Armbar me at will because I had, they looked the same size as me. Like they look pretty similar. I looked at these people and I'd be like, well, you're not bigger than me. Like if I realize how vulnerable you are.

Speaker 2:          00:36:22       Oh, it's disturbing. I think fighting, like even learning a little bit of fun and makes you more afraid. Not less for more humble for sure. So also don't you feel like at all the pro athletes fighters are probably the most approachable in the most down to earth, easy, easy shot. There's a reason why when a UFC fighter goes into an event, whether it's the sps, whatever it is, all sorts of stuff, right? There can be NBA, Nhl, nfl, the WHO's who, actors. The room wants. Talk to the finer because guess what? No one was willing to do what a fighter does. So when a famous fighter walks in the room, he's the center of attention. Every time, man, that's fast. And every time when, if there's Michael Jordan and like Uriah Faber, different store in Michael Jordan, Michael Jordan's lithium now Muhammad Ali. Michael Jordan. I bet you Muhammad Ali's going to get some Jordan's mom.

Speaker 2:          00:37:13       I'll leave right now. Who's on whatever when he was young. Yeah. How about. Okay, let's prep Mike. Mike Tyson, 86. Mike Tyson. Mike doing. I bet you more people go up to Mike Tyson, Mike Tyson and 86 taps into the street and people would call their friends to the fact that there's a man in the room that can kill everybody with his bare hands. Yeah, and that. That's, that's fascinating to met. That's the John l Sullivan. I can lick any man in this room, but everyone. When you're a kid, everyone wants to be a fighter. You're fighting your brother, your kid. The neighborhood. Right? What sports boiled down to the raw element. It's like the game you're playing is let's play, kill you. Let's try. You try to kill me. I tried to kill you in. Some of them are the game, right? Like football's a game. Basketball is a game.

Speaker 2:          00:37:53       Listen, if if Lebron James, Mrs Jumpshot. Hey listen, he's going to go tomorrow. If I missed the timing of Mark Hunt's left hook, listen, my jaws will be shattered in 30 different spots. I'm not fighting for probably a year and a half. That's the difference. That's the stakes are a lot higher. Way Higher. Not even comparable. It not comparable at all. You could lose 20 basketball games in a row and still go to the movies. You imagine if you lost 20 fights in a row, not going to have a job. It'd be impossible when you're physically. Well, you know, I was trying to. Eddie Bravo and I were talking about this. This is a perfect way to describe. One of the great things about Hugh Jitsu is think about how many times you've been tapped in your life in, in Jujitsu. I probably been tapped a 100 times. Now. What if I had been head

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       kick, knocked out 100 times? What if 100 times I got. We'll kick like Luke rockhold. Could you imagine a person who's been wheelchair? I'd be dead. I don't think you could take full meal. Kicks it back to those in your life to have some problems. You'd have nothing left. You'd have literally nothing left, but you can do that. You can get rid of naked choked 100 times in a month and you're okay. True. You're going to be sore, you're really sore, but you're going to be okay. And there's a big difference between the teeth move, but this is the difference in striking. If someone's about to blast me with the right hand, I can't tap out and be like, Nah, we're good, man. Yeah, you got that. You got that. That's good too. If listen, if you're going to get the guy who's like, if I get a of some, I'm going to rip your arm up.

Speaker 1:          00:39:20       You're gonna be in trouble. Some times, you're not going to be able to roll everyday. Yeah, that's the difference. That's true too. That's true too. There's a way out. You just do. There's a white flag in boxing, you know, and these other sports. There's no white flat. That's why it's so crazy when someone doesn't use that white flag and you marched. Her shit gets snapped like hands. You're out for a long watch. Sakharova break his arm. Well, that fight was over though. How about tim? Tim Silvia and Frank Mir. Frank Mir snapped his forearm and half earlier, Tim Silvia's trying to punch him with the left. He knew something was wrong, but he was like, you know what? Fuck it. I'm just going to hit him with my hand. I didn't see that. Oh my God. It's snapped. Like the forearm was to stop. No, no, no. See, pull that.

Speaker 1:          00:40:06       Frank Mir breaks the audience. Didn't know what was going on. So the audience was yelling and I had explained to the audience. Yeah, I had to explain it. I go watch it right here. And the audience went, Oh, you've seen so much. Watch this. Watch this. Watch this. Watch this. Watch the forums. Yeah, baby. That's how powerful herb dean is. A bad motherfucker. He. Yeah, let's stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. He separates it and he's like, Yo, dude, your arm is broken. This fight is over. You're doing the replay. The audience was booing. They were really pissed off. I go. Watch this right here.

Speaker 1:          00:40:43       Oh my God. Frank Mir was one of my favorites. Yeah, my God, that was incredible. Arm Bar. He's the only guy in the UFC, by the way, who's broken? Two guys arms to high level world champions arms and insane. No, Garrett and Frank Mir. He almost ripped lesnar's leg apart. Legs or last. I had a normal size leg. You know Masa Gotti fucked up, man. That was a bad listener. Was tapping and they tapped again. He taps some more and then finally the referee stopped it. Paula [inaudible] style for sure. Oh, if Paul Harvest got ahold of that, he's. Well, he doesn't do the straight leg locks. Cool. Locked, which is way more trouble. Well, he's doing insight helix. That's his favorite. He loves that inside. He'll get it again to somebody. Well, he let go. He let go. You see? Everybody is saying that he doesn't let go. They're going to jump on them. No matter what he does. If he gets submission, they're jumping on him.

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       He absolutely is held submissions for too long ago. Absolute, not just once, many times. There's fights of his in Brazil where he's got a lock on a guy and he will not let go in the referees. Prior Anatomy. He will not let go and I don't remember. It was a choke or was a leg lock, but he fucked that guy up. I heard in training. He's the exact same way. You don't really only trains with his brother, his brother. He doesn't do that with everyone else. Like, no, I'm good man. He hangs onto stuff that's so crazy. That's so scary. A guy who does that ridiculous. Especially a guy who's built like that. I mean she. It's crazy how he is the biggest hundred and 70 pounder I've ever seen anywhere. Here's a smaller forehead than me. Have you ever seen him? Does we both have like my, like my eyebrows are about to run into the side here.

Speaker 2:          00:42:18       It's very similar. Cro-Magnon, so yeah. Yeah. He's. That guy has the best leg locks man. His leg locks were so finishing. You know, he grabs a hold of one. It's like nine out of 10 someone's tapping for, except Alan Belcher beat the brakes off belts or beat the British. Totally. Did he do it? He he like willingly went into because he worked in all of it and just post them in the face to face. Sat on top, punch pass. I should ask Alan and give props to whoever coached him on his leg locks there, but Alan Belcher is a wizard at that shit now because he prepared for that fight and did everything every step of the way, like everything blocked. Everything knew exactly what to expect and you can see Paul, her was just so flustered. He really didn't know what to do because Alan was like in right where he wanted in this spiderweb defending everything and then punching him in his face.

Speaker 2:          00:43:11       He says a little bit of an issue like do there nate Marquardt when? Yeah, when they pulled out the leg submission. He's like, what? What? And then Bam blasted in the face while he was accusing native greasing. Leave that nate got out of his. Well, nate, nate was pretty honest about what he did. He said I warmed up a lot because I knew the guy was a really good at leg locks. I want it to be nice and slippery, so I sweat a lot. You're allowed to do that for sure. Yeah. I mean there's no issue with that, but he's like, yeah, he's like, what? And as he's pointing, Nico's just dove on it. It was great. What do you remember that fight? He fought Dan Miller and jumped up on the catch and hit him and rocked him and for whatever reason decided to fight was over.

Speaker 2:          00:43:54       So he starts celebrating Pars case. They pull them down from the cage. The referees, the fight still on like you have to keep fighting like, wow, what are you doing? Like did he end up winning? Well, I think you want to sit decision, but it was one of the weirdest things that embarrassing. It's like he just decided to referee stop real mccastle jumping up on the cage. Oh, they're literally grabbing his shorts. Were like, Hey, you owe me. You're still going. Paul hired. Pull that up. Paul Harris versus Dan Miller. Um, well if you could find it, find the, the, the exchange because it's so bizarre. Sweep. He has an issue. Obviously if you hear you read about that guys,

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       childhood, it was one of the most horrific childhoods. Oh, that's it, right. That's it. Is that look like he walks away. He's on the cage. You have to tear them down. Yeah. Let's look at the finish again. Watch how muscular he is. Dan Miller going to do it all the way back to the beginning so we can see what happened before. So he hits him. He had some boom, boom. And he just got, he just decided. He just decided, look, I live out. Dan Miller's rushing over to them to grab him on the cage. What was he going to do? Just those arms are. So what does he weigh in there? What? 80 five. Well, he weighed in at one 85. He's probably, you know, two plus. His nickname means tree stump. Yeah. And this one, but it's terrible. Carl and. Oh, his childhood. Yeah, his trial.

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       It was unbelievably horrific when he was working. Yeah. He's working on a farm when he was a little boy, they eat pig slop, like he literally had a pig slop, like to stay alive. We had no food when he first started training, he was just dirt poor, as poor as can be. This big scar on his chest. Like they couldn't afford to take them to a hospital. So they glued it it like a giant gash on his chest and they glued it together, you know, and when he was a little kid, I mean he, he lived a hard, hard life probably filled with trauma that people like us that grew up in a nice neighborhood probably could never understand again. Kenny and Malibu, who wants to fight? No. Macklin screwed bud. Paul Harvey's is Super Glue in his ankle walking pigs when he was eight years old.

Speaker 1:          00:46:06       Yeah, well we're talking. We might've been talking about that. Was that before the podcast or was it during the commercial? So we were saying that, but it's the epigenetics thing that scientists have proven that fear and memory can be inherited via sperm and know that when did that, when did they, when did they. It's been a while, but um, there's, there's papers that have been published on it now. Apparently researches began testing the pups of traumatized dad's for a startle response to different smells. The assetto Fino don't settle. Fino and stimulus had a big effect which was not seen in the controls to emphasize here. These pups never actually learned any previous foot shock trials to the set of phone that the phone was bad news. I guess that was evolutionarily though, because remember Steve? Yeah, because Steven Rinella said you start hunting and area the animals like the elk in yellowstone because the wolves are just introduced. Their generation to generations have not had to deal with wolves. So what happens is they don't really know how to defend against wolves. They don't, they don't have the built in several responses, etc. But as they start getting killed by wolves, more and more, their offspring will learn and it. So it makes total sense. So this is what happened. They, they use the smell of this chemical which has a citrusy smell. It's called a cdot finos and it was paired with a slightly discomforting electric shock to their feet. So that's what they did to

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       the dads. Then they gave the children of the dads this set of fino and spray and they panicked. This is rats. Mice, mice. Yeah. I mean that's, that's some insane shit, man. It's just joB is that whose job was like, hey, you get the rats grabbed their feet, man. Who was doing that? Well, that's given these rat that. That makes sense. Evolution from an evolutionary standpoint, you know, you, you, if you continue to be haunted by lions the first time at gazelle seas alliance, it's running. It's not, it doesn't have to say, hey, what is that thing? So my kids going to love coffee and fricking thick chicks or whatever. I think every healthy, healthy boy likes thick chicks. I was having this conversation with women about, um, oh, with the amy schumer about models like the idea of a model, like no one likes that.

Speaker 2:          00:48:22       No one likes that. That's kinda what I mean. It's not awful. I don't want anybody who's really skinny to feel bad. No, don't starve yourself to look like that. I'm not doing anybody any favors, but it's very rarely find a guy who was like, dang, look at that girl. I can see every rib. It's like trying to take a nap in a wooden chair. Like, no, I, I've never met a guy who just signed me up for that skinny ass model. Yeah, yeah. The girls have this idea where they need to be that skinny guys don't like that. Well, it's gay guys who are fashion designers. I'm not saying this trait cars aren't, but a lot of them are gay. Let's be real. it's not homophobic to be honest. There's a lot of gay guys that, you know, obviously they're not looking for hips to weight ratio.

Speaker 2:          00:49:04       Waist ratio asked to waist ratio because they're not thinking about fucking them, you know, so they like sledding, but also, but also go that cool looks, that dress looks cool on that coat hanger. If we could get a chick to be that skinny and thin so it'll look just like that and then toss the blonde wig. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. So the clothes. Look the same. Yeah, so that's why I couldn't address, but women, they need models with blotter acid. Women decide that. Women who looked like that look good though. That gets weird for other. Yeah. Yeah. They're told culturally, you can be told like some tribes in africa, like are they in Burma? Those women with a really long necks was the women in africa that put the plates in their face. Yeah. The bigger the playtime cattle, you're worth foot binding in China, you're, you're.

Speaker 2:          00:49:49       You can learn cultures. Learn what to track. Yeah. I'm just talking about like how weird boobs and ask siri. Yeah, well that's the normal route. That's the dna genetic, but there's the cultural route. What do you think it is? What do you think it is? Why guys are attracted to a bigger butts and bigger animals? That's a fact that they breed better. Sure. Larger breast, larger asked me and she's going to have more fat on her body. She'll be, she'll be healthier to take care of the baby. The is going to burn off a tremendous amount of calories. You want a healthy woman on a sickly person. You See her ribs, that'll be unattractive because that means she's starving already. Cnn saying fricking eating amy

Speaker 1:          00:50:27       over here and then thick amy, but there's a reason why guys like, ooh, look at those big ass titties. Little ass too. why is the healthy even animals, male animals are attracted. Round surface, muscular. You're also attracted to like a big ass is like the sign of great genetics. So it's just a reward speed. But that power and everything, but then even more than when a girl gets surgery done and gets implants. I'm sTill cool. I'm game. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. you're letting your system get checked. Tricked, checked. You're letting your system get tricked. Like fake tits. Yeah. That's the thing with guys, fake tits and fake gases. They actually do work, you know, we're, we're so pathetic. Like our desire to just analyze it and just get our loads out. I know we're dealing with like, um, like pretend you were a ship and the ship only had so much room for bullets on it. You know, if you have too many bullets on it, the fucking ship's going to sink. Well, every day a new shipment of bullets arrives and you know what, alright, we're just gonna have to fucking be a little less choosy with our targets. Started shooting into the water in the sky. You got to get rid of bullets. That's what it's like being a man. Being a man is like being on a fuck battleship that's constantly receiving a new ship and uh, bullets and you're looking at books, they're looking at the fucking notebook and you're like, oh,

Speaker 3:          00:51:55       look at all those bullets we already have. Oh, alright, alright everybody on deck, we've got to start fucking shoot in the ocean again. Everybody on deck, all hands on deck. All hands on deck.

Speaker 1:          00:52:05       People who don't fire off the rounds on their own, they're not judicious about that. What happens to them though? They get hoodwinked and some shitbag relationship with some woman who controls how they come. You know, I've, I've had friends with her girlfriend won't let them jerk off, are you?

Speaker 3:          00:52:22       That's crazy. I'll tell you right now, my friend comes out and say, have a good day, sir. We're no longer friends or race my number. Never call me ever again. I went to Alaska and we came across so boring with fishing. Me and my dad lasted one day by the way. Fishing. Why? Because I don't know how to fish. We lost. We lost every lawyer. Every lawyer in one hour the guy goes, we'll just put an alarm. Will go, oh no, we don't have any more because you lost them all. Anyway, I told this story of my past three different point I'm making is that we found a guy who had an arsenal he had an art show have to do with chicks and shooting about shooting gun. Same thing when you have a lot of ammo. He had crazy amounts of ammo and all kinds of machine guns and I said I couldn't. I couldn't squeeze off enough rounds like day after day kick, kick, kick, kick. I became completely desensitized. I was trying to shoot everything. I was like, what's that thing in the water? Is that an otter? That's very different than what we were talking about, but I see why you can see what you're saying. See what type of bad correlation you were talking about. I, I saw

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       a report where they say some guys. Jesus, what is that? Who is that is? I can sign me up. Okay. Is that a real ass? Are you sure? Are you sure you showed that hasn't been pumped up. Yay. Hey, guess what? I don't care. I do not care. Okay. This is my. So yeah, whatever. Why is welby? Let's make it. She's probably not even real. Life is probably a gigantic hallucination in the first place. Hologram? Yeah. Some sort of mathematical program from space where we're on some computer simulation, but if that is the case, you creating essentially everything with your imagination that exists all around you. It's like you're literally live the point I was a. I saw, I saw a report where it says you can test trail where some guys are wired where they just can't be faithful. They're just not wired to be monogamous.

Speaker 1:          00:54:15       I wonder if that has anything to do with the same thing that they're talking about in this, this story with a sperm being transferred from father to son. I wonder if that's the case with um, because there's some things that they say like the children of racists are almost inherently racist, not inherently racist, like unavoidably so, or they can't learn, but they will tend to show racist tendencies more likely than someone who was an adopted child. If someone who wasn't racist, that's crazy. Well, I think they're trying now to figure out exactly what makeS a human being. We don't know yet. So when you see something like this with mice and you gotta think what's more complex and mice or person or persons way more fucking complex. But if the underlying mechanisms like this, like what they're talking about in mice does nothing for me, but it doesn't because it would.

Speaker 1:          00:55:04       If you were a guy and you got mugged by a black guy and a black guy beat the shit out of you and took your wallet and then you had a kid and your kid just fucking shrieks every time it sees black people. I mean That is real. That's the same mechanism that would keep a look. There's a reason why rupert sheldrake had this analogy about a kids and monsters, like, why is every kid afraid of a monster? Even a kid who grows up in New York city like you should be afraid of car accidents, right? You should be afraid of floods. You should be afraid of shit that's real, but kids are afraid of a monster in the dark. Why? Because our ancestors get eaten by jaguars. Alright, we saw way, way back in the day before they figured out houses and spears, all that come made the people of today and all that stuff's in there.

Speaker 1:          00:55:47       That's why some people have a video phobia. Some people have arachnophobia they're afraid of snakes or they're aFraid of spiders, and it is fucking paralyzing. If you've ever seen from an evolutionary point of view of the state in this book, why evolution is true, why are people afraid of snakes? And a lot of people inherently from all, all over the place, are afraid of snakes. you take a fake snake on. They've done these experiments right? Where people are killed by cars way more often. Why? Well, primates, when they see a snake will climb a tree, almost like they're afraid of snakes, so they think it's. They think it's. That's why they're still here. They think it's an evolutionary memory. Yeah. that, that, that human beings have carried from when you know back back,

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       really. They did a whole fucking research where a guy listened. Snakes are scary as share reason though. I know he's panicking for a car wreck. No. You got into this thing where you're trying to anti intellectualize the whole situation and you like this is your watch. Esco. No, not at all, Man. Not at all. No, not at all. There's a reason because a rattle snake will bite you. correct. Shake his sale, bite you. How often have you seen ralph not even know that I don't even know that name. Date. Declamatory. Almost immediately they see when they bite you. Right? But they don't know that we're talking about things that have never been exposed to snakes. They don't have a book to read. People that don't have videos to watch. Just see us, man. I saY see a snake with these huge things and they don't know what that thing is. It looks like a stick that people have. You don't touch a snake.

Speaker 2:          00:57:25       monkey of common sense. Brennan one sense reminiscences most likely rented common sense was be, uh, be. Be afraid way more afraid of cars because they kill way more people a year. Then do snakes. Right? But people we know, we know cars. People. No snakes. Not really what I'm saying. That's why we're terrifying. What are you talking about? People don't know. Snakes. No, they don't. Wait a minute. Come on man. People don't know what a snake is. Saw snakes taking my yard two days ago. Well, good for you joe. You around rattle snakes all the time, but everybody has an la la. if you have a yard, it's very possible that snakes are. They don't know how many routes. Thanks sir. Zero rattle snake in your car. Trust me. You might not see a rattlesnake, but they're out there, but that's probably a very small population in your neighborhood there.

Speaker 2:          00:58:16       The poInt I'm making is you're missing the point. Evolutionary scientists have to say, I've, I've, I've realized that we have a natural and a human being seemed to have universally have a phobia of snakes and things. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. They have a natural phobia of snakes and what that is probably as an evolutionary memory, and I'm talking, joe was talking about how you have you create fear memory through generations and that is an example of that. Whether or not you know you're afraid. Snakes. What the point is is that there are other things in life you could be. You should be way more afraid of him. People are not because we don't have as long a memory of it, and that's the argument from the argument. I get both arguments then. Why are people scared of aliens? Well, because they're scared of the unknown. We're not just only scared of things that we see that are scary because our grandfathers got bitten by one. We're also scared of the unknown. We're scared of the dark period. I think it's a good theory for sure, and it makes sense, but I think there's also some things where, listen, you know, if a predator walks in my room, I'm be like, hey man, what's up? Let's hang out. No, no, no. My children, when you go like this to children,

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       they start crying little babies. That scared me. Why though? Because it's a memory of being eaten to memory, of being eaten. So what they found is even infants, when you go, when you bury your teeth and go like this with your hands, you go and grout, low noises for infants. That's why when men come into a room, a lot of times children when they hear a low voice, especially when the person's talking loud man, they immediately are way more afraid of that than they are of of a woman with a high voice. Why is that? Why did they start crying? It's strange men. That is a. That is according to a lot of evolutionary biologist. That is a memory that you were actually born with. Not in. What's that called? Instinct, right? I mean it's the type of incident or the babies are scared because the giant do talking all loud.

Speaker 1:          01:00:05       You just chalk it up to that. They're not afraid of teenagers. Why? babies are afraid of a lot of shit. They're afraid of things don't make sense. Like a ladies hat. The fucking giant feathers. They freak out because it's to get the point you're making and I think it's true, but I also think sometimes you just know I. You know what I think? I think it's not either or. I think it's both, but what they're saying in this study and memorize what's been proven in this study though is pretty unavoidable. if they're. They're detecting this stress response to a very specific smell that they've created that they associated with electric shocks and then the the children have that same reaction. That's pretty much proof, but then how's this go back? The guy being faithful was saying is the same thing with racism. I was saying that there's things that are even useless.

Speaker 1:          01:00:52       Things that are passed on from generation to generation and I think at least at one point in time there was a time where the human race has probably in jeopardy and it was probably ridiculous for one guy to have sex with one woman and hope that the race was going to keep going. Everybody fucked as much as they could because half the babies got eaten by jaguars. I mean, what are the odds of a fleshy little fucking shitty designed human disease? Survive animals, wolves, fucking everything you until you figure out weapons. Then you have to band together and that doesn't work out. Look, it's a hard road for a long time for people to make it this far. Now it's so out of control that we're overwhelming. The population is overwhelming the resources of the planet and will continue to grow at this rate or have an exponential rate, but a long time ago, man, it was tough to keep people alive.

Speaker 1:          01:01:49       During the roman times. It was a 50 percent infant mortality rate. Fifty percent. If you had two kids, one of them was going to die for sure, and you just had to deal with that. They're just having sex with whoever it was. Cool. They were mad dog in it because they were trying to keep the race alive. You know, one of the things that they found when they were going over the dead sea scrolls was that they, the dead sea scrolls is the most, the oldest stories of the bible that are known. It's the only form of the bible that's written in aramaic, and they found that in these scrolls in Iran, it was written on animal skins and left in these caves and these, these ceramic pots. They found that a big part of What they were concerned with was fertility rituals. They were concerned with making sure that they breed, making sure that they carry on.

Speaker 1:          01:02:37       I mean, this is, we're talking like thousands and thousands of years ago. We. That's nothing though. When you think about the fact that humans in this form of essentially been around for close to a million years, so for a long time it was a hard scrabble life where we might not, might not fucking make it and the only way we could make it is if we protect our territory and fuck every chick we can, which is shooting and to everybody. So miguel was like, let's do this. Those are the men that made it, the men that made it, the humans that made it were the ones that had this evolutionary trait. And it conversely, by the way, and you're saying that trades carried on. Yes. Well that trade exists in primates, but not. I don't think it'll all. I don't think to all. I guess some still have it know it exists in all primates.

Speaker 1:          01:03:19       Every single primary, the only primate that it's ever been observed to even try to be monogamous as a human being. All the monkeys, the gorillas have harems and the gorillas have such a domination over the females that the females never cheat. So because of this, the grills, dicks have shrunk the size of an inch. Gorillas have tiny, tiny little ball and the little chimp pitches or whole ours chimps are sluts. So chimps have giant balls and giant eagle, but not as big as humans. Human beings are the most promiscuous. And there's a direct correlation between female promiscuity and male testicular size. Really? Yes. The bigger the balls, the more likely the male is surrounded by a bunch of hula. The dick. So your body recognizes this and the the. The competition builds up so you, you come more, you build up more. There Was a bunch of faulty conclusion reached by a book called sperm wars and this book is basically, there's a lot of junk science attached to it and a lot of it was about these killer sperm that attacks sperm and killed them, but they've never been able to conclusively prove that sperm have any properties other than trying to get someone pregnant.

Speaker 1:          01:04:31       There's never been proven that their sperm that are attacking other sperm or any mechanism which they kill the sperm. But what it has been proven is your dick is shaped a certain way. Okay. And the big fat head at the end is a goddamn plunger. and like the evolutionary design, a dude has got a little dickhead, ever see a porn and the guy's got a little head is poor bastard. WhaT are you going to do with that thing? Exactly. Because evolutionary, we look at that the same way we look at a big ass or big tits. Like that's not a good design. Like look at that little fat, fat dick with a little head. You're a mess. You're not plunging a can. My, my, my girl, I'm not, I'm not jealous. You're plunging. You'rE using this big fat dick head. The bigger, the better to squirt out all the other dudes sperm. And then with the hood of the books. Hooker. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       It pulls it out and then you shoot. Your own is intense. It's intense. But that's the design of the human is the plunger. Yeah. Everyone's book. And that's, that's really. Are there any anteaters in here? Do you want to have a hood hanging over me? no, believe it is as well and tortured, but in england most of them have the hood. I didn't know that. Well, it should be because it's gentlemen mutation really is because my coach tony jeffries in santa monica, he's having a baby. I said, man, if it's a boy, you're going to cut the hood off, right? Like it's weird to leave it on. And he goes, no. He goes, who kissed her hood? Off I go, uh, everybody. Haven't you ever seen the scene that you're better at it can't. No studies, no studies whatsoever. All junk science shit under the, you know, a lot of religious thing, right?

Speaker 2:          01:06:10       They taught it a little bit of a religious thing, but it's also, I believe that they're preparing for a giant backlash of babies have had their dick sliced because if circumcision was proven to be genital mutilation and stopped, then guess what? You opened the door for suits. If everybody just decides to go ape shit on the american medical association or anybody who allowed essentially a non beneficial genital mutilation to norm to be the norm or real. Do you know what kind of backlash? I mean, this is not a propaganda or rather a, a, um, a, a conspiracy theory, sort of a, an idea. This is the reality of what's going on. Genital mutilation on a wide scale that's completely unnecessary, that has no health benefits. What, what's weird is in a locked room, nfl college locker room, if you got a hood, you were the outcast.

Speaker 2:          01:06:58       He made fun of your fund. Your dick. Yeah, but tony was saying england, if you didn't have a hood, you got made fun of. I bet it's weird, right? Well, one's natural hair. That's not right. Yeah. Well, it's also about with the plates in the lip and all that shit. It's just whatever the culture decides is the norm and the culture's decided that cutting your dick to her house to her of course. So you have a better chance of not contacting like a gonorrhea and things. I think that's. I think that's all. There is no medical society in the world that has recognized any real health benefits to circumcision. It's all bullshit. Not only that, the risks include infection, hemorrhage, scarring, difficulty urinating, loss of part or all of the penis, and even death. Circumcision complications can also and do occur even if the best in the best clinical settings. Early producers back in a little too smiley. Oh, there, you got some hoods that more than maybe this decade has more than one baby has. This decade has died in New York because the rabbis who, uh, these really heavy religious jewish dudes insist on using the moyle who uses the traditional method of circumcision where they circumcise the baby and then suck his penis to stop the

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       bleeding. And these rabbis have had herpes and given her [inaudible] to the babies, they refused to stop this because this is a religious procedure. There's moyles online rabbis online. they're doinG these videos on like the jewish name for what that procedure is and how it's written in the torah. And this is why you should do it that way. And this is why it's a traditional way. Yeah. Could you imagine? Here's the task that the universe has given you. Like we're on a, we're all following different patterns. Mean brian, you've got a nice golf shirt on. I have converse all stars well following patterns, right? Here's the pattern. The pattern is there's a fucking ancient religion that was written back when people thought the world was flat. All the fucking rules are written down on animal skins and fucking chicken scratch that you can't even read today, and it says you could suck baby dicks.

Speaker 1:          01:09:04       You cut their dicks and then you suck them in humanity if that didn't exist and you try. Does that true? Absolutely. I will show you a video you want to see a video. Is that in the video with spraying explains about a sucking a penis after circumcision? It's one of the most thing. The internet or this is a no, no, no, no, no. He told me to. I talked to rob about it. Who was raised incredibly religious. Are he studied the torah 12 hours a day and he was. He watched all this shit and he said, yeah, what the guy is saying is true. I don't know that it happened in the things that John Duran who wrote the paleo manifesto, did my podcast, talked about was the old testament with the obsession of washing. You know, he calls moses the first microbiologists, the idea of a guy who they were obsessed with keeping things clean.

Speaker 1:          01:09:55       I don't know. Find out if the guys have been talking about it being read the descriptions or listened to it. We got to talking about sucking on a penis to up circumcision. Rabbi sucking penis. I bet you'll doctor. I don't have any kids. If I did and dr touching my kid's a dick. He's getting. Well dr jack his dick to make sure everything's okay. This guy, first of all, he's not a doctor. He's a religious nut. He's a cult member. That's what that guy is. I mean, if, if there was no religious extreme, not extreme at all. If there was no religion, if religion didn't exist and some guy came along and dressed like a fucking spaceman and wanting to suck baby dick's, he'd be like, well, that guy's in a cult, but because it's around for a thousand years, it's not a cult. Oh, it's a religion.

Speaker 1:          01:10:39       Needs a fucking cult. Anytime you can get people to adhere to an ideology that you have to look to the stars to find your fucking answers in some magical man who has rules like not mixing meat with milk and coupled with a lot of those rules. John duran, who just wrote this book, a lot of those rules were we're very practical backnet not eating sugar because because you didn't want to kiss the kenosis exact sexual laws were know the restrictions on sex where just because you didn't want to catch syphilis and things back in the day. So there's no cutting and baby dick sense. I don't know anything about cutting, cutting, sucking baby dick, all that. Does

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       he know that comes from moses when he cut his own penis to show his serbians to god in the old testament. That's a very weird way to show your speaking. So you haven't had a friend breakup. Dick moses. I heard of that before I've ever had to rush into the emergency room. Does it ever get fixed? Totally. Or is it always kind of hooked it kinda. Yeah. Curves to the left a little bit. Wow. His balls literally internal bleeding filled up. Oh look. Like purple gecko skin. That's why you've got to be careful with crazy bitches. You got to get double under hooks on crazy bitch. Crazy bitches riding you. You gotta, you gotta hold their ass. But like, uh, from, you know how you got to go? You can't just do this because if you do this, there's too much lateral. There's room for doubt.

Speaker 3:          01:11:58       Gable grip. The lower hips. My buddy is huge. You've met this guy. No, you can say his name on there. These guys. Sixty six to 70 shred runaways. Wait. People are gonna. Figure out who they are. They will figure it out. So he's like, he tells me, he goes, bro, this girl wants it so hard. He was, I don't know what to do. I knew how hard he goes, I'm going to film it next time. So he films it and it's one of the most disturbing videos I've ever seen. I mean, he's getting ear like why am like dang, week later he calls me up, dude, get over here. I rush over. What's the. He's on the ground, but button naked. What's the matter? He goes, that video I showed you. I was backing up, missed my penis, hit her ass, broke his dick. Oh my god.

Speaker 3:          01:12:45       So thIs is what I tell them. I go, this is an easy fix, right? I, I've, I'm, I have no idea how to hand this. Dr schaub. Yeah, dr. Schaub in the house. Big brown.shop in the house. I know this is easy fix. I'm going to step out of the room. You put a little porno on, you get a wreck. We're just going to line it right back. Right back up. Just like you fix a broken nose. That's a great strategy, right? Right. Makes sense. That's a great room. Ten minutes later I hear, I'm like, oh shit. So I called my doctor buddy. I'm like, yo man, my, my buddy was hooking up with this girl broke his sticky as well, is like, you're his testicles big. Oh yeah, man, they're pretty big. Let me see your goes man. Shows me these things are the size of a grapefruit and it looks like ghetto purple dotted. Oh, rush. Dr. Rush. I'm the merchant cause internal bleeding. And uh, people thought we were just to gays.

Speaker 3:          01:13:39       Gay men. Big dudes. I'm not making this up. I wish I could make this up. He straddled in a gurney like this, right? He's like this things hanging down. It's filling up, talking on about. This nurse comes in, hey boys flaming, flaming gay guy, right? Which is whatever. I'm cool with that, right? Legs up and straub if this is his broken penis. This dude's like this. Yeah. yeah. This is pretty bad. Listen, we'll get a doctor and we'll be rigHt back. He's doing that to his boss and I'm like, what is going on in leaves? Doc comes in, old dude. I'm like, oh, thank god dot comes in. He goes, yeah man, this is really bad. Or yeah, the nurse was kinda, uh, you know, he's grabbing a man. It's insane how badly it goes. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Speaker 3:          01:14:31       Nurse physically touched his penis, touched telescope, knows, deepen his in his, on his dick. And he goes, wow, I need to get the name of that guy because that is not code here that the white jacket, $500. My wife has got an app on his phone and when anybody gets administered in the hospital with a broken dick, you fucking shows up, puts on his lap, dances. This urologist comes in. I go, I gotta be honest, man. How did you get into basically majoring in dick's? Like what role did you go down and he Said in Egypt or someplace in Egypt where um, there's a religion, they might be muslim, I'm not sure, but they get erections. They think it's dealt the sentence work and they break their debts. Not in, that's not muslim religion. There might be. Well no, it's an extremist muslim. He was saying it just sounds like a dumb person who, whatever it is, it's another crazy cause he was saying he and these guys need help, so he got into it because he was exposed to it.

Speaker 3:          01:15:39       So these guys think it's satan's work. The devil's work, they get erections. Snap their day. A lot of them died from internal bleeding. He had, they brushed doctors down there. So most urologists go down to this part of the world. That's a fix it guy. Anyways, my buddy, my buddy got a break. He's all good now. The updated my friend. All good. They give him pills so he couldn't get an erection for six weeks and his dick was in a splint. Really? A splints. Splints. It just has a hook. Yeah. So I'd hook or a big one a. Oh, it's definitely knows. What's that operation. You can cut the tendon and it makes your dick, but it's nice Florida around your tickets. harden. it goes straight down. Sometimes. That was the complication that. How much longer could it make you got to jerk off downward.

Speaker 3:          01:16:23       Huh? How much longer could it make that small? Yeah, and institutions, you can cut the tendon that will actually create more length here, dick, but the problem was that the, for whatever reason, the tenant is one of the instrumental tenants and keeping it very hot, you know, rec. You would thInk they would build some sort of implant for that. By now they have implants, root thing else. People are so fucking weird. You're so weird that we'd be willing to cut or a dick to stretch it out and you know guys, if you could get fake. Dick's is like the way we're going to get fake tits guys will be walking around with fit 15 inch dick. No, they wouldn't because women wouldn't want it. See, there's a big difference. That's why guys aren't allowed to wear a pays and guys and girls wore wigs. We don't give a fuck. Girls can have fake tits. Who cares if a guy has fake shoulders? That guy was walking around with fucking fake shoulders and you're like, oh my god, I love your shoulders. anyway,

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       scorned scorns. They're like fucking fake taste like that. They sell shirts like that. Yeah, they do. They sell shares. You have looked into it. I did a world's dumbest and they had and it was one of the inventions that they sell them and well that's theirs. They have pants that women wear that like suck everything tight to their ass banks. Yeah. Yeah. That's what made me millions, but in that crazy, like wilmington have fake tits when we can have a lot of fake things are extensions, but it does not bother me at all. We don't care because we're trying to fuck as many of them as possible. That's what the monkey dna wants to do. So when the, when the monkey has no problem wIth the fake tits, the like, that's great for now let's go. Whether they like it sticks out the way. I like it.

Speaker 2:          01:17:51       But you know, like your, your dna so scrambled. Whereas the woman looks at you with your fake shoulders like, oh this week, shit, mother fucker can't even grow a shallow women. Oh, you're not coming in. Make women want you to get the job done. They want utility. Men likes things that are static, that look good, that we can grab and fuck, but women need to. I mean, I'm saying evolutionarily you, I would imagine women need. You got to go out there and actually hunt something while I'm taking care of the kids and if you've got fake shoulders are going to help you catch that deer. You're like a weak person is not able to completely look at reality, but you can see a hot chick with a pretty crappy dude. You know what I'm saying? You never get to see red plate looking dude with a real fat, ugly girl.

Speaker 2:          01:18:38       That's true, but you will. You do if he's gay, but you do see you. You also see like these guys that are with these girls and the girl is like way better looking than the guy younger. Probably sugar daddy. Yeah. You see that a lot of times women are attracted. I would never date to go to something like guys, we're really good at something and he's not that good. Looking. Women find that very attractive. So you get a guy who someone's older and older. No, I mean if you're like really funny, you got really good skill, man, you can still get those young girls there are wrong because billy who works at the arcade, who's jack has no skill, she's going to take billy that works at the Arcade over you as a skill. You say that, but then you see david spade with a dime.

Speaker 2:          01:19:25       yeah. You know, becauSe he's funny and he's also rich and famous and rich, you know, good at some famous, tough, famous, different names, different chicken head there. A lot of guys. Chicken heads coming there. A lot of guys. Not chicken heads. What's that mean? Chicken heads like girls, just fame. You know girl, there's been beaus you know what I'm saying? Like oh, chicken, chicken heads. But you said that as if we would know what you mean. Oh yeah. I thought you would do. I said ma'am, chicken and I've heard him use the expression before, but it fresh chicken head is a female who likes cock, a female as giving head bobbing. this is in the urban dictionary, a dancing up and down like a chicken and it's a dance move. Well, brendan shops got his own definition of chicken heads. I get it, but if a guy can play the guitar really well and he's not that good looking, he's getting laid.

Speaker 2:          01:20:13       Amy schumer had a strange thing we were talking about last night, being a girl like she was talking about how being a girl sucks because you have an expiration date on the time where people want to fuck you for sure, and it's running through a clock that's running from the moment you realize that sex is important til nobody wants to fuck you anymore. Ready? Go. Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock. I heard my grandmother talking about how devastating it was. The first time she realized men stopped looking at her. she said she. She realized she was finally old when she walked by a group of construction workers. One of them looked up and she said that was when she was with other older women and they all went, yep, I remember that day too. My heart broke heartbrokeN. I was about 15 or 16. Man, that's a tough.

Speaker 2:          01:20:56       That's a tough day at some girl. Tell me. Still don't, don't waste my time because I'm in my prime. I have three more years left in my time. I had a girl tell me a wasted wasted a year of my life with you when I didn't want to keep dating and was like, okay, now I got you. Just totally let me know that I made the right to say that I thought we dated and went to dinner and had a lot of fun and I thought like all my other friends, I enjoyed your company. I didn'T know that you were investing. We're fucking their twenties, you Know, I was like 23 or something like that. Jesus christ, this is crazy. A lot of girls are raised to think, you know, you've got it. I'm even my own mother who's a really smart woman, said to my, my sister, when she went to get her mba, she went, hey lIsten, you're going to get your mba.

Speaker 2:          01:21:44       That's great. Work on your mrs as well. You know what's on your mItten, mrs. Oh god. I tell brian all the what we talked about this, talking about relationships all the time. I'll talk to brian like, man, I'm a little stressed out. Should I be having kids are doing something here, showing me coming home and a life making food and stuff, and he goes, no man. That's what society wants you to do. That's the norm. That's what everyone wants you to have this conversation with people who asked me because they know I love having kids and they'd go, do you think that everyone should have a kid? If I didn't have a kid, would I still be happy? And I said, absolutely not. Everybody shouldn't have a kId. I go, you can be a great person. Have a great life, infect a great amount of people around you.

Speaker 2:          01:22:24       Be a joy to be around. Contribute every step of the way. Be a a great example. Inspire people and never have kids. Hundred percent. You don't have to hunt. It doesn't make you better and, but people take this goddamn self righteous attitude when they do have kids and I resent it and I have kids and I love. I love my kids. I would never trade being a father for anything. It's a fantastic experience. Have a kid when you are ready and have a kid. If you feel something from it or don't or don't eat it, it doesn't matter like it. It's a great thing for me. I enjoy, but you don't have to. I know a lot like my friend chris ryan, dr chris ryan who wrote sex at dawn. He made a conscious decision. We as younger, no kids. He wanted to travel the world.

Speaker 2:          01:23:05       He lived in barcelona. I mean he wrote books. He decided he had a life that he wanted to live for. This pisses me off when people don't want kids. really. My brother don't let kids and drives me nuts because he loves them. Give something back, man. You're pulling this earth to procreate. Give something back. Oh, I don't know about all that. Why you put on this earth to procreate. Okay. for the same reason, homeboy before they're all dying. Not everybody has that much to offer. So some people, some people may like, how about somebody who is basically unhappy with their life and they have kids or if they don't have too much stevie again, that's. Yeah, watch how I do bro. This is the stuff. That's what I do. There's more of these grabbiNg a whole form towns and grab another one. Man county. Can I drink all this?

Speaker 2:          01:23:48       He doesn't even drink it. He gave up already falling asleep. I'll get them over there and I'm all like sensitive. I have one cup. I'm like, well, I feel shaky. I. I know what you're saying. You don't think that there's a good thing to do. When I like clothes, I like shopping. I like my vacations. I don't want kids. Why is that? You know what? Lose my number. You're not my friend anymore. How dare you, but why is that bad? Why do you care what other people? I don't know. That doesn't make any sense. Especially if they're close to me. You know what drives me? Nuts, man. If people hate kids and something about women hating kids. I wrote this on twitter once that I view women who don't like kids the same way of your dogs like to eat their own shit and then the cis male feminist guy wrote this huge blog.

Speaker 2:          01:24:30       I should have said hate. I said, don't like, so he connected it to the only reason why women exist in his world is to have children like they added a bunch of stupid shit that I don't believe at all. To reInforce this idiotic point. You're writing a blog about a tweet. You fucking idiot. True. You know, that's, that's what you're doing. And by the way, he's an academic to first of all, for you singles out there, red flags. If a girl likes cat, doesn't like dogs, and then like kids. Yeah, I'll read, carry on in some people's lives, in some people's lives, it's a good thing if you want to check the doesn't like kids and you don't like kids. She don't like kids. She's probably pretty selfish. My man could be. you're right. No, no. Most likely, most likely your she's into something or she's just in tip.

Speaker 2:          01:25:12       She could be and makes $8 a day. I mean, who looks well? Everybody has to want children, but yeah, it couldn't be some sort of a really demanding occupation. She handles really bad childhood or she had a really bad childhood. Okay. And again, you guys are talking about the exception in general in general, she doesn't like someone who has a really good career or demanding career today. That's not really the exception that much. There's a lot of women who have very demanding careers today. Yeah. And very fulfilling. You don't run into them. I do look at brendan just made the like, I just farted. You know what? In la. Yeah, they're everywhere. I meet a model actress. I mean what you just said right there from regular women. I understand what you're saying. Let's broaden our horizons and try even though with three. I'm talking from brendan shot in marina del rey.

Speaker 2:          01:26:09       I'm not talking about finished the world and brennan shop. Marina del rey. People that don't want to have kids. Like, fuck you. Here's my number. There you go. There you go. There you go. She goes, hey, I'm kelly. I love cats. I've had cats. I hate kids and I hate dogs. I'm like, cool. Over red flag. Well that's. That's how that lack of not liking dogs thing. It's a weird thing because it's like, unless you're allergic to them that I understand, but if it's like a, like a nurture thing, like you don't like animals that like you or need you. I'm I like my cat because I can push it away and never cries. I can leave food that's in a weekend. That's a personality trait. Like I love dogs. What? Somebody one time explain to me what a dog is and they were talking. I read this article about how dogs are evolved to be really friendly and that's how they manipulate the cosmos cosmos.

Speaker 2:          01:26:58       when I read that I went. I was like, maybe I Don't like my dog as much as I used to. I used to really like be like my dogs, like a human. I talked to them now I'm like, yeah, you're a dog here. Manipulating me. Know the circumstances. Why I lost a little of my affection. I love dogs. I love them and I'll never not have dogs. My wife's allergic dogs. I'm like, tough shit. Dog will have dogs, but she takes medication shot. She just doesn't like hug them as long as she doesn't hug them. It's fine. It's not severe really. Yeah. But if she hugs him, she's gets red marks on her arms. It's very common. But some people, man, like I'm Gary Valentine, a buddy of mine, you know gary comic, he couldn't come over my house because I have cats. I have cats and dogs.

Speaker 2:          01:27:40       Dang dog. I love animals. I do too, but not cat. I'm allergic to them. Never had a cap. Gary couldn't even walk in the house. He was his voice with his, uh, his, his pipe start shrinking up. Couldn't breathe. He would make them whIstle if I, if I came with the house, can't touch my face. My eyes swollen. Shut. Wow. Allergic. I'm allergic to nothing. How about think about that. What a weird response that is. Normal shit for other people. Like a bag of peanuts given to some people and it's death. Well, well, how about I was eating a lot of Brazil nuts and then for whatever reason, but the my mouth. No. Well yeah. No, not me. Not me. Get this. The inside of my mouth would swell up to the point where I was like, why? Why is he inside of mouth? Literally I was like, whoa, whoa.

Speaker 2:          01:28:25       And it got worse and worse, and then I was like, what the hell is going on? So my mother comes over and she goes, those are Brazil nuts. I go, yeah. She goes, do you know if I eat one, I would die. And I went, what do you mean? She goes, I can't even eat. I said, no, she, she ate half a Brazil nut that was in a salad long time ago and she had to be rushed to the hospital. Why didn't this bitch tell you? Right. So what does that really mean? I'm clearly alerted to Brazil nuts and I was the wolfing down. I mean wolfing down at least partially. You probably don't have it as bad as her, but. But when you lack, I guess an enzyme for certain

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       nuts or whatever you. Brazil nuts are high in zinc. I have you. Have you ever had your bLood tested for what you're allergic to? I want to do my genome. I did a whole diet where they test your blood type to see what your lieutenants that I'm allergic to egg yolk and that's really it. Yeah, nuts. That's crazy, bruh, bro. Brazil nuts actually can increase your testosterone. That's why I was eating them. My trainer told me to take them in my shake. Really, mass amount of them are lIke super fucking healthy for you. It says a salinium apparently. Also it helps lower your ldl or bad cholesterol, reduces the Incidence of blood clots in heart disease. If I eat a shitload of brazilian nuts or they need a lot of nuts, brendan tested positive for Brazil. Says here they actually caution limiting yourself to no more than two Brazil nuts per day because they are so loaded and concentrated with millennium that you don't want to overdose.

Speaker 1:          01:29:57       Copper and selenium are very important minerals, but with minerals like balance is really key because you've got to be real careful with like overdosing and certain minerals. There was cross a brazilian nuts. I'll take this into account from dose to dose daily. They were selling these mega vitamins, these, uh, these kind of talking about how they were selling vitamin d tablets, gel caps, and it was 3000 over 3000 milligrams and the guy said to get, you'd have to eat 1500 almonds to get that much vitamin e. It's too much. It's just too much. You got a lot of vitamins, you gotta you gotta. Be careful. You can't be an idiot. Yeah, that's pretty basic, but it's easy to be an idiot. Yeah. It's easy to be an idiot, you know. That's what's really weird about this supplement. The supplement business like uh, it's, it's very tricky.

Speaker 1:          01:30:41       Like what effects certain people doesn't affect other people. Like with alpha brain for instance, when we first put alpha brain now we had slightly different ingredients because some people had an adverse reaction. They would get like a headache when they would take. It wasn't a dangerous thing, but it was enough for like, hm, this is, we got to back this down a little bit. And so you, you got to be careful with like certain reactions that some people have. You know like you with cats like you with peanuts, like that's the thing when it comes to vaccinations, like everybody talks about vaccinations, like you're either in the camp of you believe that vaccinations are evil and they cause autism or you're in the camp that those people are idiots and they're dangerous and then these anti vaccine people are really making all these diseases like measles show up in New York city again, but the reality is that the truth lies somewhere in the middle because yes, vaccines are super important.

Speaker 1:          01:31:32       They're the reason why we don't have a lot of infectious diseases that wrecked havoc and there's science behind them and it's fascinating. The human beings have figured out how to create these things that have fight off diseases, but some people are going to have adverse reactions to everYthing. Yep. That's the reality of medication. That's the reality of foods. That's the reality to environment. There's some people that can't small. You're right, you're right on with the masses, but you're. But you're dealing with 300 million people for sure, but when you're trying to get people, but what I'm saying is when you have those small amount of people, if you have 300 million people and all of them get vaccinated, you're going to have 100 people, a thousand people. You can have all These examples of things that went wrong and people look at that and go, well look, there's so many people where things are going wrong, but what you're not thinking about is the just sheer numbers of people that kept from being diseased, sheer numbers of people that we.

Speaker 1:          01:32:26       How we contain polio. We contain anything. Smallpox probably killed $500, million people throughout history, unbelievable. And we squashed it out through vaccination. All put so many children in on iron lungs and in wheelchairs, and not only that, they did it in our grandparents' lifetime. Know incredible, incredible discoveries have been made by science, but it doesn't mean that some people have adverse reactions. Some people are going to eat peanuts and they shouldn't. They're going to die. It's going to happen every year, every year, more than a thousand people die from aspirin. They take aspirin. When you take supplements, make sure you look into the data because a lot of this stuff is not regulated, so if you're going to take massive doses of whatever it might be, make sure you take a look at the data. Take a look at the double blind studies, see if it bears out well.

Speaker 1:          01:33:13       not only that, it's also when you get, when you get a supplement, like say if you're running a supplement company and you're buying vitamin b 12, okay, yeah, you got to fucking task the vitamin b 12. You get from the source, whatever it is, vitamin d, whatever you're you're getting. You have to test it. You have to test it independently because with alpha brain we've had to make sure we had in the past we had problems with manufacturers having like bad mixtures like when you, so calcium from bone meal has a great deal of lead in it or some. Something like that. Think is What is crazy amounts of lead in bone meal for whatever reason. I can't remember if that's the exact thing, but it was, it was like a metal, it was a case, a lawsuit, and the vitamin company has brought up on charges because the source of where they were getting their calcium was very heavy in.

Speaker 1:          01:34:03       Uh, I believe it was lead metal. Yeah. So you got to know where it's sourced from and you've got to know what your body's life. It's so hard to tell what the fuck's going on your body. I told you I was having that problem with a. I had arsenic in my blood. It turned out it was from sardines. Hey, you're spending a shitload of every. Every science I've had, like I've talked to about podcasts and stuff, says they always come down to one thing. None of them say meat's bad for you. Can I take, take them off? Take. I'd take four. Yeah. I'm going to get you some of the shrimp tech through texts and fascinating shit. Shroom tech sport. Yeah. It's all quarter steps. Mushroom. It's all a oxygen utilization. I'll show you all the data behind it and send it to you. It was all a developed for the chinese olympic team. Really? Yeah. Fascinating stuff. They found it in high altitude. Hurting populations is animals that would eat these, uh, these mushrooms would be more active. And so the people started it and then they started

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       cultivating it. You started using from hearing you guys talk. It sounds like it should hire you as my nutritionist. I told you about this lady. I have a good nutritionist. A no, joe. No. I know this story. I was recommended to this late. I'm not going to say her name or where she was recommended this lady. She goes, yeah, so this is what we do. And she goes, what are you looking to do? I go, I love, I love to eat clean. I feel goody and clean looking to lose weight, you know, I want to stay the same way. Just like eat healthy. Perfect. Ideal. I deal with a lot of high level athletes. I got you. I'm not making this shit up. I showed brian this bitch gave me chili cheese fries for breakfast, chili cheese, fries, and rice was for my breakfast. I took a picture of it, emailed her.

Speaker 3:          01:35:44       I said, I think, I think my order got messed up because you said you got to pick up your meals. Right? Right. I think the order got messed up. There's cheese and chili all over some fries for my breakfast. She goes, you have a busy day of training. You're going to need the calories. Yeah. She lasted for a week on brian. Why don't you keep it for. What about the meeting? What was that meeting like? I can watch all the meal. Eat cheese fries, chili cheese fries and crazy mail in the mail. My chili cheese fries better be fresh. I want him in the mail. They don't put them in the mail. They delivered earlier in meals. Delivered. Unfair. No, I use a private company, a small company. So the woman who runs, she runs it. She was um, she had a job as a um, I forgot what it was, but she, she got fired or what have you.

Speaker 3:          01:36:33       And she starts her own food business. WeLl, yeah, I got chili, cheese, fries. I fired her. And then, um, it, it didn't go. We didn't mix right from the start, right when I was in a rush, right? I'm like, yeah, I'm here to pick up my meals, blah, blah, blah. She's like, well, can we just sit down for a while? I'm like, sure. So she's like, well, you gotta sign this contract. I'm going over it. It's like, oh, hi brendan schaub for the next 30 slash 77 days will not eat junk food. I'm like, yeah, whatever. I will not drink soda. I don't drink soda. Third one down will not drink coffee. I will skip that one. Keep going. Well, not well, not cool. And she's looking at it, going through the page. She goes, okay, we're good. Oh, you missed one right here. And I go, yeah, you're talking about the coffee one.

Speaker 3:          01:37:16       She goes, yeah, yo, that ain't happening. She goes, skews mega. I mean, we can get into this if you want, but there's clinical studies that show coffee, helps out with workouts and I mean it's not bad for you if you do it in moderation. She goes, well then I don't know. I go, well, I'll tell you right now. It's not going to work out. I'll walk ouT right now. She goes, all right, I'll make one exception and then just right then I was like, god, this is not going good. Yeah, I don't work with her anymore. Long story short, she got fired. Chili cheese fries should have fired her. That shit's ridiculous. You should be eating fruit and vegetables, not chili fries. Chili cheese fries with rice. And she said the calories. Oh my god, she's so retarded. This is pre workout. Did she ever

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       worked out hard a day in her life? Do you know what kinda throw up and shit would come out of your body if you eat chili cheese, fries and that did like a strength and conditioning workout. Did box jumps and kettle bells and battle ropes. Chili running through your bowels. You ready for this? I, I, I'm going to launch at the bell. The only heavy weighting. Who's on a diet like this? It's called the alpha diet. I don't eat breakfast. I do bulletproof coffee and the mct oil and I hit the ground running. Well, that is about don't you juice in the morning? Vegetable juice? Yeah, yeah. Oh well that's something too and you'd be amazed at how much butter and mct oil you're dealing. The reason why this bulletproof blend works is because you have the healthy fats connected to the caffeine. It's a slow burn of the caffeine, but you can't get over the actual calories.

Speaker 1:          01:38:41       I mean someone should take one of these things and find out how much like a thermos of this bitch is calorically with that much butter and that much mct oil. I bet it's quite a bit. Oh yeah. Eating a funk on hunk of butter takes a while for your body to digest those fats, but it's. I'm it though. You could burn. It's a great way to work out, like to drink that stuff in the morning because you feel full, you have energy and yet you still get a good workout and drinking. What about eating a sugar source before you work out? like a, like what would it be good. Like they say nothing's better than fruits. So not pancakes or. No, no, no, no, no. That's terrible for you. Pick some chili cheese fries. If you're doing endurance sports. Gluten is a tricky thing, man, because if you have a bad reaction to gluten, um, you're, you're going to have all sorts of issues and even if you don't have a bad reaction to gluten, the studies are showing pretty clearly that it causes inflammation and it may be fine, but with a lot of people, you get this bloated appearance.

Speaker 1:          01:39:42       Like I've seen people go from wheat to no wheat and then they're, the face shrinks in their body, looks different. It's like your body's inflamed and it's a lot of weird calories. It's calories where your body's breaking down glue, you know? I mean taste great. I mean, I love lasagna, I love pasta, I love delicious bread. Don't. It's great. You go to a restaurant, italian restaurant, they bring over that pregnant, smell it and yes, I'll put some butter on that and me and brian like a nice cheese plate, little cheese plates, these plates. Nice. It is. The problem is gluten is just not a smart choice. If you thinking about what you're going to put in your body, why fuck around with that? You could have lettuce and you can have all sorts of delicious greens and you could have fresh meats. You're going to have a good. Your body's going to get good nutrients, can have What it needs when you're having gluten or pasta or anything like that. You're just giving it a nice delicious taste, and if that's where you're cool with, that's cool. You know you're just out on a date, one to have a delicious meal, but if you want performance food for your body, you really shouldn't fuck with anything that's complicated. Exactly. Sweet potato, chicken breasts, sweet potatoes and yams. Fish. You know, if you can get some game, get some deer. buffalo. Yeah. You know what else

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       is good? Lamb. Ryan. What'd? What'd you guys hunt? Deer. Deer. Good, good. So rich in nutrients and vitamins ever had it. So low in cholesterol roasted. I'll make a roast steak. A 12 ounce elk stake has less cholesterol than a 12 ounce chicken breast to shit on that sticker. There's nothing better than elk. So good for you too. It tastes so good. It's like almost got a sweet taste to it. It's a dark red meat. Oh, elk tenderloin grill. It's so stupid. I was eating every meal, every meet including mountain lion, and he goes, ah, and he goes, yeah. He said, if I had the one meeting every day, it'd be out. Yeah. A lot of people think that giant animal never had elk. You should be hunter. You'd love it. Hate. I hate. I sent a picture of the deer and we could use bone marrow.

Speaker 2:          01:41:45       I'd be telling, man, we'd be down for that. Oh yeah, let's do it. I said the three of us, deer hunting to hone ranch would be down for that. I bet you would be down for naked and afraid. I'm doing this thing. Doing his thing. No, no. We're gonna wear. I'm gonna wear extra clothes just because I love it. I think I would wreck shop on that show. I think you do find until you got your dick bit by a spider and then you cry. There you go. Because I'm telling you to own ranch, hour and a half north of here. We stay for a weekend. We film it. We go pig hunting with bows and arrows to it. I'm so down for two days though, right? Two days. Saturday and sunday, and then we say, hey, and then we spot on sunday. I'll fill his spot, spot each other lifting spot, spa, spa, hot tub, facials. I got confused. I was like, he's a prima donna. They'll be like, what if he. If he got the toughest one of the toughest guys in the planet, he misses a meal. If he's a half hour late to him, you know, he's like this, I'm lightheaded man. I'm starving. But you gotta think of what he's doing with his body all day. You can't even imagine. I'm chilly. I'm cold. You guys.

Speaker 2:          01:42:53       Imagine how fucking much he works out. I know you don't. You don't take that into consideration. No, I don't. Brian who I work out all the time once a week, he might get in a workout once a week and he probably instagrams that to just work out moderately. You might work out once a week. You might go a month. He's the guy on was the longest day. How many days have you gone? The longest without anyone at work. Every single day. The fuck away from that question. I'll come to your house and find you not working out. How about this box? Twice a week, but I work out too. I don't work out. I don't ever work out everyday. Nobody works out every day. You need days off. I take sunday off. Oh, well, almost now. It's almost used to be. I workout everyday. I'll tell you what though. Brian's footwork is impressive.

Speaker 2:          01:43:42       It's impressive. When I saw pres. Thank you buddy is a dancer. I'm going to teach them different moves. Move his feet around it. He's got an aldi. Tony's a good teacher, man. Trying to try to move around that guy. My god the best. Oh, by the way, I am when I'm. By the way, and by the way again, I am definitely not. As you get more tired boxing, just try to just try to move around and you're exhausted. Focus right now. Can we? Can you pull in your cock? Kelsey's tight ass peter. Pan green jeans on peace and it's peace. It's just bulging out. What are you doing? I'm an american. Rather than your crocodile? No, but whenever I'm around brendan, a little extra blood flows in. Well, you know what it is. It's that same thing that causes men chimps to have bigger balls. It's like you're around a an alpha male, and he's like, well, I'm trying to compete and your dick is like, we better get bigger for sure.

Speaker 2:          01:44:33       Get your dick out of my face. Yeah. That's not the way to compete for sure. It very. Obviously you're mixing it up. You get confused. They'll get these chimps. Paul's looking at that. Yeah. That's it. The muscles on that chance. Jesus christ. Good luck with that. No, it's cancer or brutality, but totally different tendonous structure. Everything's bigger and thicker. Everything's ridiculous. God, that thing weighs 150 pounds and they can throw itself through the air with its arms. Let's imagine that they grab a branch and just throw themselves through the air. It's that other one like it's velcro and just hang and fucking. They could be a thousand feet off the ground hanging from a branch. Do you, joe? Do you think you could tear it up on naked and afraid? Me and brian, you wouldn't do well. No one days. Nope. First of all, the stupidity of it all would insult me as a human being so dumb that I was willing to be on a show that was exploiting me to the point of making me naked.

Speaker 2:          01:45:29       Go through the fucking jungle. I'd be like, after one day I'd be like, oh my god, I'm an asshole. I am such an that. This is who I am. I'm not spiderman. I'm not fucking herschel walker talker too. He'd be like, this pillow was my with dirt on my balls and I'm like, this is so stupid. I'm sleeping on dirt. There's spiders everywhere. I just like the challenge. I'm not outdoors. Guy had hunting gear like joe and I did with gear with tense. That's a bitch. That sounds super boring. It wasn't boring at all. It was very exciting. Brian in Montana, I was scary. That was fun. It was really fun. We went rafting 40 miles down the Missouri river place where there's nobody. I mean we saw five people in five days. I'm down to kill animals with a bow gun does nothing for me.

Speaker 2:          01:46:19       Just super boring guns is a great way to do it because you definitely kill them and you also can get them at a large distance so you can get many more shots. Like getting up on some animals is super problematic. Problematic with a bone arrow, like what we did kind of hunting. We did, yeah. They started a lot too. They also, you know, they. They had been doing. they did okay and did pretty well. There's a lot more buffalo back then they didn't have the long range rifle capabilities of wait, so they got in the water. A lot of times they went to, they, they crossed the river and then they we to do that. That could

Speaker 1:          01:46:49       be the three of us. We wait until they get in the water. We start just bam, bam, bam. Whenever I have a 90 pound draw, it shoots a 475 green arrow, which is pretty heavy. Three hundred and two feet per second. It blows through everything. It'll blow through a buffalo and elk there. Everything. Boom, right through bone. Everything. Boom. It's gone right? It goes through trees. I shoot it. If I, if I missed the target and it hit like it hit the, um, I had the target set up on this a fence post. It blew right through the fence post, like a big hey by four of would blew right through and out the other side, a two by four. Think about what it would do to a body. Wow. Yeah. And so one of those, you might as well have a gun, but you're going to have to be close enough to hit it and shooting anything 20 yards away, it's tough.

Speaker 1:          01:47:42       Forty yards away is really tough. Like the difference between when I shoot a target that's 20 yards away and 40 yards away, like the amount of movement that you could do before you release the arrow, a 20, you got a little bit of wiggle room and then you can release it, but you get to 40 and it's so minute because you're looking at something that's not magnified your site and you're looking at target that's so small because it's so far away and you just keeping that motherfucker right there and then letting it go. Don't you find that more exciting than having this done? That basically does it all itself. It's like a video games. Definitely more exciting. Animal comes walking through your fricking. Here's the problem with that logic though. Here's a problem with that logic. That poor animal will definitely get killed. If you have a rifle with a scope.

Speaker 1:          01:48:21       If you have a rifle, a scope, you're looking at that animal from 200 yards away. That's a dead animal. Boom. You're blowing a hole through that thing clean. If that deer is sitting there, it's all in you not fucking up or your your gear being off. You could I. I fucked up in Wisconsin. I dropped my rifle. I fell on a hill and my rifle scope. Then when they installed the scope, changed the scope. When we got to Wisconsin and the guY when he put the scope on, didn't have it tight and when we fail, it was like you could lose it where you can move it with your fingers and it caused an animal. Get wounded you. You don't want that and you have a way more of a chance of that with a bow and arrow way hard to shoot an animal with a rifle.

Speaker 1:          01:49:00       Shooting an animal with a bow and arrow is really good. All this technology now that's hard. When I saw the video of you, the three of you just chilling like this one sleeping bag, telling jokes and then this little like reindeer came prancing around and caribou. They live in Alaska. You had like a bazooka and it came a bazooka. No, it wasn't a. It was a canon light. We had a helicopter gunshIp greater than me while you eat me, dude, what are you talking about? You're just getting something that's tortured all its life and then shoved into a fucking vice and they put a piston. I'm not against it. I'm just saying it doesn't seem very exciting. It's very exciting when that animal comes out of the woods and it's looking around. When you get an animal in your sites, first of all, you've been tracking it for three days, four days and you haven't seen and it's a wild animal.

Speaker 1:          01:49:46       I'm just saying if you were it with, with, with bows and arrows, technology, it'd be a lot cooler. Well, here's the thing. In Montana where we were, if you were bow hunting, you're fucked. You're not going to get it close enough. Shot. The closest shot I got was 200 yards. Those the only shot that I got, I got one deer shot it at 200 yards. There's a long way. The you can't even see that far with a bow and arrow site. I mean the idea that you're going to hold that dear and it's gonna look so small when you're looking at it with not even harder. It's not. I mean, I don't think anybody's ever done it. I mean maybe a few people have done it, but you have to be like expert archers to shoot a deer at 210 to 20 yards. But with a rifle that's, that's common.

Speaker 1:          01:50:25       Super common. Yeah. You know, you line it up, it's a magnifying rifle, you see the deer really clearly. You locked the cross on his heart and boom, it's over. I think hundred would be a lot more cooler if if you were hunting like something that could sneak up on you and kill you, it'd be a lot cooler. The problem like that, like dear. Oh no, I missed it goes prance and away. You know what I'm saying? Like who cares? So it would be cooler if Your life was in danger. That deere hat, like salim was like waterways, water buffalo when you, when you should have water buffalo. A lot of timeS they disappear into the tall grass and you must go into that. Tallgrass and, and finish them off. Now the video of cameron hanes shooting a water bugs. He's waiting for you. My friend cameron hanes, who uh, is the guy who got me hooked up with hoyt and he's the guy who got me the 90 pound bow is the same boat that he shoots.

Speaker 1:          01:51:12       So I shot it at my house and it's so accurate. I like, I gotta get one of these things. It's incredibLe. It's so accurate. It makes me more confident to shoot because I know that if it hits something it's because it's got sites that are really, really. Yes, and it's just. So look at this. He, he snuck up on this 2000 pound water buffalo in Australia. They are dangerous. Fuck yeah they are. We'll try running first of all runs faster than you and it weighs 2000 pounds. That's crazy. So it only sees movement. So You see how he's not moving. The reason why he's not moving is because it's stopped because it's sense movement. So then when it goes back to eating, he starts creeping in. This whole process is taking him along to this guy. This guy I'm going hunting with shape two. he's in very good shape.

Speaker 1:          01:51:53       He does 20 eIght chin ups. That's one of the reasons why he does it. So you could pull back this monster bow because that beau is most human beings. I mean you can pull it back. Brian can't. I'm so I'll do 28. So eight pounds. So how did he get this? So this is a friend of his. Behind him is filming this. See, obviously there's a guy who was holding the camera, so he's is a long, slow process. You don't have to speed it up, leave it alone. Jamie, this was a long, slow process where he has to wait for this animal to give him a broadside shot and when the animal's facing him, he can't move at all. This guy doesn't hunt with rifles. All you hunt with bows and arrows. I liked this 60 pound ball and it was really hard. You're such a bitch going to shoot this thing at the day and it takes a long time bro, because if you fuck up the thing knows you're there and it's running at you.

Speaker 1:          01:52:39       Essentially it can't jump behind. The chair goes, here it goes, so now the thing is going to give him a broadside shot. It's close enough. He's down to about 30 yards with a shot. With an animal like this, you want to ensure that you shoot that thing through the fucking heart standing faced the wrong way. It has to go sideways totally because right now it's quartering away, so you're only going to hit the shoulder and it might not hit a vital organ. So then you've got an angry buffalo with a stick in his arm and then it's running at you and it weighs 2000 pounds and it runs 40 miles an hour. Good luck. I'm for sure. Hi mohan. Those trees. But look, this thing is waiting and so he doesn't move man, because it's looking at it. Look at this dude. So this is a long fucking stock man. This is like a 20 minute stock or he's standing there with his 90 pound fucking bones man and he's not moving left. So noW it goes back to eating. It's decided that he's not. He's nothing to be ashamed or to be concerned with. Ashamed of. And I saved up. So now look, now he sees it and he pulls it back.

Speaker 4:          01:53:44       Good.

Speaker 1:          01:53:51       I think runs off. It's got to fucking grow through. It goes through. It's the side of its arm and right into its heart. That's Why there's so much blood pouring out of it. That's why he hit it there. Yeah. Well those animals, you have to. You have to know the anatomy of each individual animal because animals have their vitals in different areas. So it's got. It's got an arrow. It's heart right now. Yeah. So it's going to sit there for a couple seconds then realize it's done that shit. Unlike that. There it is. It's going to figure it out any second now it just drops. I mean when you're dealing with an animal that's that big. Any other animal like a north american animal would be dead. A bear would be dead. A deer would be dead. Anything that's. But this is just an enormous gigantic animal.

Speaker 1:          01:54:37       Kidding me right now. Look at this. Yeah, and it sort of takes awhile. It's just sort of bleed out and it wanders off and collapses. He said he ate it and wayne, he put one piece in his mouth and he chewed it for half an hour before he could swallow it. That's some, that's some dense muscle. Not only that, when they were there, they didn't bring any food. they brought just enough snacks to get them through like a day and they didn't bring any water, so they had a boil. All This water and the water all had buffalo piss in it. So every drank, every sip of water they drank was buffalo pissed. There's the thing fell. It's done. wait, now this was in um, in Australia. Yeah. Australia. I didn't know water buffaloes were in Australia. Well, they're not native. Oh, okay. This is what happened. One of the reasons why they encourage people to go over there and shoot them there. A non native invasive species, theY brought him over there, but they don't have any natural predators. There's some things that can eat them, like when they're babies, like a crocodile I the size of that thing, man. Jesus fucking christ. Um, some things can eat them when theY're babies. Yeah. Crocodiles mosTly. he's jacked. He's in shape. yeah. He's in very good shape. But like I said, he all this shit

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       just stick. Trained for hunting. Yep. This guy, um, he runs ultra marathons, so living hunt down. He's a, he's got a television show and he's sponsored by a bunch of different companies like under armor. He's a famous bonner, but this guy like he, he does ultra marathons. He ran a 100 mile marathon beast. He's an animal. He's just, that's what he does and he just does it all. Bow and arrow style. That's my. That's the shop. After you retire, you're going to need an outlet for all this savage aggression you got inside your body. So I'll tell you what, I'm not doing what? Waiting six hours and shooting a water buffalo. Say you're not man, not iron man.

Speaker 2:          01:56:23       You like to hang out with you guys. I'll drink beers and stuff. You'll do a lot of jujitsu. I feel like when you retire. Retire for fighting. Yeah. Do you have any? I'm going to do the world's actually in may. Are you really an ag? Not geeky. Whoa. Wow. You training with the gate? Do you feel like that? Do you feel like it helps you in any way? Would I do? because if I have a 250 pound black built on top of me and I can escape his site controller or I can control them when you take off the tee and these guys are trying to punch me. Man, it's, it's easy for me really. That's interesting. So, um, it's uh, easier to defend because when you're defending with the ge you're more, you hAve to be more technical with the gif. So much to worry about.

Speaker 2:          01:57:07       I have to worry about color chokes. The guy can grab me and control me through my age, you know what I'm saying? So you feel like it's cross training? Yes. It takes away my explosiveness and my athleticism and it forces me to use technique. I found that with defense for sure. I get caught in a lot of arm bars with the key that I would have never got crushed. But also my in my defense goes through the roof. Really? Yeah. So you play a different game when you start doing that, you just become much more technical and much more aware of where the positions are. Yeah. How flexible are you, man? Uh, in cerTain areas like my hamstrings are really tight, but pretty flexible. Yeah. Do you have a. Well, I shouldn't ask you this because someone fight. You might try to exploit it. what do you work your guard?

Speaker 2:          01:57:48       Yeah, some guys are like, fuck it, I ain't going to be on my back. That's stupid. No, listen, when, when I get taken down a little bit and taken down twice in the octagon. But um, I do not care. Like if hunt was the whole game plan, if he trained all this wrestling still have a tough time taking me down. But if you trained all this wrestling and decided to put me on my back, cool, let's do it. I'm all game for that. I don't panic down. I'm very comfortable down there. I spent because you gotta remember my daycare was shane carlin on top of me. I wasn't, I wasn't getting a lot of take downs. I was on my back all the time. That's a crazy way to start your training in mma. It was horrible. Horrible mess. So credit is it like everyday just beat me up. Trevor whitman seems like a crazy dude, man. He's A good dude. I mean like a very good dude. Good guy. I haven't been there in years. A maniac like he had shane car when I'm like why they wanted to have shankar wind sport spar with gsp and gsp was like, what? Yeah, why

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       would I, why? Why would I spar him? Like what are you talking about? You and I think like trevor's a genius when comes straight and stuff like that. But I think back on it and there's this thing where I felt like I had to prove day everyone I could hang with shane carlin and no matter when we were sparring, that's how my footwork got so good because I'm used to this giant water buffalo mad water buffalo chasing me around the octagon. So I was trying to get out of the way because he landed right hand. It was a short and he was not good man. Yeah, that's trouble. He hits so hard. He's got. So I got used to that right. And I'm moving nonstop. And then when the bell go dinging with 30 seconds left, literally no matter what we're doing, me and shane would stop walk to the middle of the cage and just rock 'em sock 'em robots.

Speaker 3:          01:59:25       I did that for three years. And then finally a part of me was like a how about no. And I shot a double bag on them and we've never done that again. Yeah. But I think back on my training, I'm like, god, that was stupid. Even taking them down. I mean, he's so strong. He's a big guY. This guy ever is a big fucking guy, man. Strong. A lot stronger than you and your strong shane is 100 percent stronger than me. NoT even close. he's ridiculously strong. bone structure is just. He's bigger than me. He's bigger than lesnar. Legs are thick, thick ass. Huge shoulders. His hands, man, before they did the, they redid the ufc glove to fit over his hands. Shane's. Shane's. The reason why they changed the glove. Shane had a five xl gloves. You have to cut the glove just to get over to his hands are so ridiculous when you shake them.

Speaker 3:          02:00:11       It's like holding onto a hand. So what was frustrating to me is, you know, I've always been in love with jujitsu. I would spend, shane would get injured or you'd have to work at a regular job and I was just trained full time and I would think I was being so good at jujitsu and shane would come in off a nine to five shift walk in. But jujitsu hunt, let's do it. I'm like, I'm going roll this big dude. you just shut. Shut it all down. When I was training at a mall, he came by and uh, and, and trained one day and uh, I didn't get to roll with them, but uh, I watched people roll with them and it was, it was like a child playing with his daddy. Bear with me just like rolling over. And I go with big guys, all the big guys all the time, but none like shane when he doesn't even look real.

Speaker 3:          02:00:53       when he walked in the door, if I didn't know him, I was like, what's up shane? But if I didn't know him, I would say to look at this motherfucker. He's got legs grown out of his shoulders. This is how it happened. I was like, oh, I want to be a fighter. I knew neymar cart. I looked him up online, found out. Whereas cademy was in aurora, my hometown. I show up there. Nate's a great guy, right? He's like, yeah man, well we Can do. We can do this. We'll figure it out. Come tomorrow. There's another big guy. He just, he only has like one fight. He just started fighting and he played football too. Like, oh cool. I show up. It's sparring, right? I show up and in blockchain current at the time is 315 lbs. Fighting the wec just jacked, looked like a silver back gorilla that just found the weight room and does nothing else. Just remember when he was really that big. There's a picture of him that doesn't

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       even look real. It's insane. And nicos nicos, oh hey, here's the guy wanted to do is introduce you to in a. Since then me and shane and we just stood toe to toe. Neither one of us knew what we were doing, blasting each other and you rolled with that mean you had the biggest and the baddest as a training partner forever. The best man was. He was like a little brother. I couldn't afford private training with trevor whitman and chain blue to me. So much. He paid for my training with trevor. For a guy like shane having a guy like you around invaluable, you know, trying to find a giant picture of me and him in emilia. I think one or two fights at the time had zero. That's amazing. Yeah. And he was a really good wrestler as well. And his, his issue reallY.

Speaker 2:          02:02:23       He had a lot of issues from football health, brought a always neck injuries and back injuries. He had a lot of um, a lot of problems with his back man. You know, the body's just not designed to have 300 pound dudes running out. You full clips as well. It's also not designed to be 300 pounds and shredded muscle. It's just not. That's true to anyone. I know anyone, and I know a lot of athletes like high level athletes, anyone who's that big, that lean and whether natural, not they're always hurt, they're always heard or they always, they're always sick for whatever reason. They just have bad immune systems or they're fighting. So yeah, that's the most ridicuLous thing I've ever seen him. That's when he was at his biggest saving. You'd find that picture. Jamie looks like, hey, uh, just a bodybuilder. So I googled shane carwyn huge bro. I sparring sparring days. I used to sit in my car outside the gym and I was so nervous, man, like, dang, I don't want to do this. Look at that picture. Look at him. Get the fuck outta here. First of all, does not look like a gaY porn picture.

Speaker 2:          02:03:29       Pull out, pull out his hairless car and stuff, and write in your button all shaved down. ThIs is no way. That guy's not going to put such a monster. It doesn't even look real. That looks photoshop, he not gabriel. Gonzaga was just just her. Here's one thing I noticed about him is he's got super long arms, a little news flash when he fought frank mir, he might've hit myths, I don't know, three times. I really, really just. Yeah, he was hurt. What was wrong with him? Uh, his back is going to prom so he couldn't train a lot. That's why I went after him so quick. Maybe got that under hook, got that under hook and those upper cuts won't drop them in. And he was hitting him with left to right. Yeah. Left. Get that under hook. Yeah. And he's known for his right hand and meanwhile he starts to him with the left.

Speaker 2:          02:04:17       He was just such a gorilla. The poor health problems. Late man. Yeah. But it's also just the football, all that football. I mean he had a lot of injuries from wrestling. He's just a rugged dude. You make a real good point though about guys there are that big because everyone. I know everyone. I'm telling you, one of my best friends, he was in the nfl. Not anymore. A six, seven, two 65. Shredded. Right. He's just always been that way. Never been on drugs, nothing always hurt, man. He had to retire because he was always hurt. Had surgeries that kind of weight on your body and they're alwayS sick. They're like shane was always sick. His immune sYstem was shit, man. Shane also worked. That's a hard fucking propagation of time job and be a professional mma fighter fighting for titles, fighting, check, check has contended.

Speaker 2:          02:05:04       Shane and I first started. He worked you not. We both worked nine to five jobs at the time when we very first started, nine to five jobs. We'd both get off. We'd go drive straight to the gym. He would drive an hour. I'd drive like 15 minutes. You drive an hour to the gym and we would be at the gym from six to 10:30 at night. We'd do four classes back to back, back. Hey, we should do a podcast like this. Like afTer ufc. Yes, we should do like one will commit to like one a month. It's three shit man. Let's Do it. This is for the. I figured we could talk mma for days, throwiNg crocodiles And fucking terror birds, joint fighter, and the kid will do joint fighter and the kid like, this'll be one of our episodes. Yeah, whatever man we can do. You know, we could record it and both released them simultaneously.

Speaker 2:          02:05:47       We do anything. We do whatever we want and we don't, but that would be really fun to break down fights. I'm fucking pumped about tim kennedy and michael bisping. This other thing with this. The other thing with carla and what's weird is there's the days of carwyn lesnar who you just have these dudes who are grill us cutting from 300 pounds of [inaudible]. Sixty five [inaudible] not that way anymore at the big boys are gone now. You guys got like cain to 40 junior dos santos to 40, big brown to 40. Everyone's kind of the more athletic. I agree and I think that there's a point of diminishing return, right? When you get too big, your body just can't keep it up. It's just like When you saw kane. I'm just running all over brock, like the pace that he put on brock. First of all, you're dealing with a brock that was sick, so it's hard to look at that like you when now that we know that the dude had that serious diverticulitis issue, but it doesn't mean you turn away from punches.

Speaker 2:          02:06:35       Go carry on. That's very good point. There's also the issue of trying to deal with a guy who's been striking for a long fucking time and you are essentially anonymously, right? You knoW, and you can't take the guy down if you do take. the guy did take it, took, came down, it came, pops right back up to his feet. Now you have to deal with that pace. Well that, but also mentally for him, he gets guys down, they're screwed. Exactly. Came down, can got double risk and popped up. Yeah. And you and lazlo was like, damn. You can see in his face like, holy shit. That's why when he fought shane, I was like, this fights over. This fight's over. And then they didn't stop at sec around shane just kind of get. Shane was dealing with some problems, gases out. Basically his body shut down on, gets choked out.

Speaker 2:          02:07:13       I fought on the same night, right? Fought brock lesnar's best friend training partner. That Was the thing, right lesnar carwyn training partners find each other on spike the main card on spike. I'm not. Chris touched her out and 50 seconds. I'm like, he's a big fat slob and he's 21 though. Tough dude. Twenty one second. A nice guy, man. He was 20 in one though. Yeah, but I'm all excited. I'm all excited. I come running back. I'm not touching that. I come back. I come back to the locker room and then shane's turned to get ready. He's getting ready. I thought he was the fight one. I was crunk right? Because I want my fight. I've never been so sad in my life when shane lost that fight because we did training camps together. He's like a brother heavyweight champion. It didn't happen. We're both crying, right?

Speaker 2:          02:08:03       Both crying her eyes out in the locker room. Dana white comes in because everyone leaves the room. I'm all really sharp. You can stay like, thanks dana. Shane, shane's literally on the floor with ice on his heart, ice on his heart because his body's gone crazy. She's laying on the floor. It looks like a giant gorilla. And sweating, sweating, ice on his heart, on his hands all over. Right. Dana makes everyone leave the room. He give shane a check. That was like, what is it, man? I look. I'm like, oh shit. Wow. I popped up. Fuck it man. Let's do this. It was a lot of money. I stopped crying. So did shane. Wow. The ice bags. No, that's real money. Yeah. Wow. Well that was a crazy first round man. If he pays himself and picked his shot's better, why would he though? They should've stopped the fight.

Speaker 2:          02:08:53       He's been to break up the fight. I've seen fights stop for a lot less cable. When you were out that to be stopped, that was you and you were okay. Like brock was. Brock got back to his corner and he was all right. I mean he got hit with some big shots. I agree, but he defended. You know what? That's when I got a lot of respect for brock. After that fight, I was like, right, he's legit. He's legit. Then I was like, now sign me up. He got rocked. He got cut. He had plenty of time to give up. Plenty of time to give up. That's when you were like, I legit just didn't know how to deal with canes hands. Well came was just too much. And also he was. He. He's operating in history. His estimation at 40 percent. What does that mean in the real world?

Speaker 2:          02:09:30       Only he knows, buT he definitely had diverticulitis. Then even if you have 100 percent, I agree with you. An a plus. A plus brock. Horrible matchup for. But I think it would be a great fight though. Fun fight while it lasted, but I don't think they really don't think so. I don't know why because. Because. Because candy canes a lot smarter, has more tools. His gas tank so much better. I think after awhile it take its toll on brock and he tko them. Time after time. Junior dos santos will never be the same again. I don't think so either. No, never ever be the same again. Those two fights were fucking insane. The corners should have threw in the towel. yeah, well, you know when, when it ended too. It's crazy because it ended from him falling on his head. He, you know, he got, he got a, he tried to do like a power, good teen on, on cain and cain ducked under and junior was so tired and he'd taken such a beating that he's holding onto this team and he literally falls forward right onto his head and like stuns himself.

Speaker 2:          02:10:27       Then they Stopped the fight, but the beating that he took up until that, there was three st pete times were herb dean was like moving close to stop the fight and then juniors heart pulled through. It was insane. Junior dos santos does not fucking give up. That's one. He had as many opportunities to give up as a human being ever gets in Life and he will not give up. It's tough. right? And I think about this, it, it's tough because if junior came five years ago, he's not dealing with, he's the champ for a long time, but because there's this group of guys and it's about matchups. Ufc is about matchups cain velasquez, junior. Dos santos junior will never beat them. right. He got that one lucky shot. Other than that, those guys fight 100 times. Canes went in [inaudible] 99. Usually he just, he just.

Speaker 2:          02:11:13       However, if junior fights verdugo, travis brown, he's probably gonna win. It's just matchups man who is a better match up for you for doom or, or, or um, uh, alice drove, I mean, that's random as hell. But uh, or who's, it's just, it's, it's. So you see a guy like allister that was at a very high level and kickboxing came over, fought lesnar, looked fantastic, but then you see him in the big foot fight post getting popped. He got popped for testosterone. You seem in the bigfoot fight. and then you see him in the travis brown fight. How much do you think he's lost from not having? This is the thing though, like he's destroying these guys, right, and then you don't want to be that guy in the first two minutes fighting alistair overeem. It is a nightmare, but he didn't fight that way against me or against me or he was very controlled.

Speaker 2:          02:12:00       Thanks for that fight. They mirror. What the fuck are we doing? What did you do? All training camp. What are we doing? I don't think you did nothing. What do you say? Nothing. He didn't throw a punch. I don't think he could hit him. I mean, I think he was having a real problem. Do something, man. I wonder what the game plan was. I would love to hear it. I bet. I bet the game plan was figured out how to tire him out and get them down to the ground. I bet that was probably the game plan. Stay on the outside was be very conservative. Don't gas out. And [inaudible] is also controlling on the ground. You know, he wasn't afraid of going to the controller the heck out of them, which is pretty shocking, you know, ran frank's a hell of a grappler and really good off his back.

Speaker 2:          02:12:39       People forget that. Alister one, the uh, abu dhabi, a european trials though alastair can the nasty canteen. Yeah. He admitted vitara submitted veto with geese submitted. Mark hunt via camera. Yeah, that's right. And a weird one too. I told him if he needed, I would open up a jujitsu school farm in New Zealand. So yeah. So we had an idea what's going on on the ground. Well, didn't you guys make some sort of a bet like you would try to knock him out and he would try to submit you wasn't there something along those lines. We need him. We're talking smack on twitter and then we got into this winner takes all and he started clowning and how he's getting knocked me out and stand up. Fighter and the kid. Come on, stand on your big letters. I was like, what's wrong with your list? Your leg to stand on your big lips and knock you out. I think kids. Could you talk a lot? That's probably. I have big lips, so it's confusing. You have a good day. I wouldn't say that like really big. I met a lot of black.

Speaker 3:          02:13:34       I wouldn't describe you that way. Like would describe brenden's shop. Oh, The lips. Big lips. Describe ms dot big brown. Me and him got on it on twitter. Trying to get his name and trying to get his nickname change from hybrid to big brown. This guy starts with big brown, big brown. He's big brown. He's just big and brown. That's why everybody calls him big brown. Now he's walking with nationality. What's your nationality? My mom's full blooded english. It's bullshit. Born and raised in a patchy. Born and raised in jewish, german. A little bit of talent. French native american and jewish. 100 percent. I don't care what anybody says. You got some. Do you ever do you genome test to see if anybody's lying? No. I need to know. Your dad looks exactly like the crying indian from those commercials in the seventies and even got watery eyes by the way.

Speaker 3:          02:14:25       Going missing is, is the braids and the long hair. Well, here's something to consider when someone talks about someone being german or someone being italian or something being anYthing, um, yeah, maybe, but who knows how they got to Germany or Italy, 17 generations before. Who knows where any of those people came from. All lead back to like some africans you did not. You didn't tell them what to tell a story about. Well, from about Cuba, kimbo slice, kimbo slice on ultimate fighter guys for doing that. Even show this on the air. So this guy, I'm not going to mention his name on the show. He lost and you can drink all that alcohol you want in the house. And there's only at the time there's only four of us left. Still fighting. Roy marcus jones. I'm mitch, mitch mitrione and uh, myself. That's the for fighting, right?

Speaker 3:          02:15:13       So one of the guys, one of the other guys just hammered, hammered. He's lost, right? Hammered, wasted. All of a sudden this guy gets super racist in the house and there's a whole bunch of black guys in the house. Starts talking out how his wife loves them because the korean nation and starts throwing up racial slurs and throwing up these, you know the hey hitler stuff heil hitler started his name on this piece of paper for me. All right dude. Dude, this isn't getting out though, right? I need to know for my own edification. So he starts doing all this stuff. I'm sleeping. I've the biggest fight of mY life. The next day. Dana white literally stops us in the condos. Listen, if whoever makes the finale, we win or not. You're gonna. Be a superstar. it's huge, man. biggest season we've ever had. You guys want to win this fight?

Speaker 3:          02:15:57       Thank you. No pressure. So I'm sleeping and I'm sleeping and uh, I'm, I'm, I'm sleeping on the ground and I thought it was a dream. Kimbo slice and marcus jones and this and this demicco in this demicco rogers a comes in my room. They go, yo, shop. Get up, dog. Get up, man. I'm like three large black eyes around my bed.

That's crazy weird situation to be in to what a trained seller is also an area nation guy. Or is he miked up? All this is going on to. He's miked up and they have to ask why didn't they put that on the show? Oh, that's not good for rating. Fuck yeah, it is. No, are you kidding me? Oh wait, didn't show any of it, man. That guy never fight again. Diddy, diddy? No. Hm. Interesting. Too many clues. We know people gonna know who this is. They'll figure it out. Tough shirt. That's fascinating. Bad news six years ago. Yeah. They have to make a deCisioN, right? Whether you put that oN the tv or not, we didn't need it though.

Speaker 3:          02:17:49       The ratings were so high and then you want to toss some highest ratings ever. By the way. Tough 10. Woo. Was it really the highest ratings ever? Nothing's even kimbo slice. Slice and that crazy. I'll never forget man, when you, when we walked in the house, right? Or walk whacking the gym, you're staring. And I'm like, oh, I don't know. I don't know any of these guys in wax. Roy nelson on their for matt mitrione goes, we'll look at the fat ass. I'm off bro. That's Roy Nelson. He was suicidal. He was winning a world champion.

There's 16 total though. So we're bringing a special guests. They hype this thing up. Everyone's wondering everyone.

Speaker 3:          02:18:32       I leaned over to roy go, bro, you know what? The route to bring you in and there's big talks at the time. Can you imagine if they did this? I said fear doors to walk through that motherfucker. Ross screwed. I have three fights, the three fatal disaster and that's why. That's why when they bring them in and in watts, kimbo slice I thought was me fade or that's why I looked over at manly. Oh fuck. Kimbo slice and that's the very first way people saw me on national tv is me saying, fuck kimbo slice. That's hilarious. I thought it was gonna be feared or man, I was all nervous. I really thought I was going, oh my god, somebody needs to talk to you. why would feed or do the ultimate fighter? I don't know. Maybe they pay them like a million dollars and he's like, can you just tear up these kids with three fights? you know what's crazy? Which really see. That'd be funny. Crazy though. is there kimbo slice would get more readings at where? Here it's weird. More people know who kimbo slice was back then because of youtube, like the casual persOn then knew who

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       fader was. I'll tell you what, kimbo one of the nicest people have a very nice guy. So cool. Yeah. Tommy out a fight with a shank. What damage it rules? Well, you leave this arm so they can scrape that. I'm going to get the knife and this one man, that's dope. While he was barbecuing, he needs, if he's listening, he needs to open up. Is a barbecue restaurant. Kimbos man. Like I could grill like no one's business. He'd make this barbecue sauce and he'd make his own sauce, but we put in it. You have the honey mustard, all sorts of stuff. So you just knew it. He knew what he was doing. What kind of. What did he barbecue ribs, ribs. I mean cakes. Oh dude, he's a chemist. A chemist. He was. He was so cooL, man. He was so cool. Good eaten. Yeah, he is.

Speaker 2:          02:20:12       He is just a natural athlete. I mean he's just big strong guy. He's got some serious knee problems, man. I Wouldn't come with that. yeah, yeah. I will say he's a natural athlete. Well, he's a tough guy. Tough guy. Real real knee problems are bone on bone arthritis in his knees. That's why I left mma. Do you try to do some boxing and he renting? We wasn't winning, but he made some improvement. He definitely made some improvement, but it was the knees. His knees were fucked. You weren't going to get better. They made some money. He made some money. He makes a ton of money as security for ic mc and reality. Kings porno, his best friend is ic. mc reality kings. Holla at your boy. I wonder if they're making any money more. is it tough to make money in the world now, right? Like you.

Speaker 2:          02:20:53       You porn. Why am I going to pay us the subscription reality kings? Yeah, that's the thing. You have to be like a real fan to pay a real cycle. I think they make money and you went with a real cycle jacket off about 10 times a day, your membership, but there are dudes that become like fans of a girl just like they become fans of a band. Again, if you'Re my friend and you're a fan of a girl and you pay for a membership, lose my number. If you don't make kids or if you're fan of girls whose know if you pay for a membership because you liked one certain porno star, you're a psycho. Where there's some guys that have very specific tastes like they only like asian broads. That's it. Asian girls only like porno asian and opportunity employer. Me too. I hate. Yeah. I encourage everybody. How about guYs who say they never jerk off to porn? Ever lie. They don't use porn and if they jerk off it's to their imagination. Again, lose my number.

Speaker 2:          02:21:54       They're lying for sure. I don't know. I think some people actually do have a problem with porn. They don't like it. They don't like the fact that they think that people being victimized in some way that you know. I've never met her guys making a lot of money. I have. I definitely. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I've met people. Hate said this, but I watched. I hate to say this. I watched. I watched him lecture. Please sit dotcom called why I stopped watching porn and it's really, really eloquent. Dude was talking about why it's damaging and ever since I listened, it's almost like now that I know football causes head injuries,

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       it's literally don't be so well known and the reason why cast is so good. You guys balance each other out so well. I was telling brian, someone needs to be in the room with him to let him be him because if you leave him by himself, he goes, by the way, throw once, theorized that the reason why this passion exists. No, he called me up because he heard the year and me doing the elliot health thing and he goes, hey bro. He goes, let me ask you one of the funniest people I know so many should show you for ms dot represent who you really are on your podcast. You should see yourself. Just be funny, brian. I hate when you're serious. Brian. I didn't say hate when you're serious, brian. I said, you're two different people. I said, there's you who's really you and there's you and it goes into lecture mode.

Speaker 3:          02:23:18       Why am I doing that? I don't even know why. Why don't know. I mean, I guess probably everybody does it. I'm sure I'd do it to a certain extent, but you do it smart people. You don't know what he did it. You know what? He did it on our biggest podcasts when I resigned my new ufc contract. I go, dana, I'm going to come and sign my contract. You mind if you're on my podcast? You did that with dana white in his office and his office. Brian. He goes, Mr. White, where did you get your inspiration from? Michael? Let's call him mr wang. First of all, I just didn't know him. No I didn't, but I didn't know his story for the story. I did, but I didn't know him so I didn't know whether he had a son to him with me before. You're not really like, you know, talk to them and now.

Speaker 3:          02:23:59       Now I know he loves. He's. He's gone. It's gone back to the porno stars though. I got a buddy who'S dating what he did during the podcast, so like made you a fighter and a kid. Did you ever talk a little bit? It was just so like the reason, the reason why the fighter and the kid works. You fuck it up? No, no, no. I just. The reason why the fire code works is because we get serious people, right? And we're clowns, man. We get them out of the elements. We make things fun. We tell him we did a great one. Ronda rousey recently, we. We tell stories with dana. He was like, where do you see yourself in 10 years? No way. You really don't know what I'm saying. Questions like that. What are you at chick? We have really good arguments that on the podcast we have serious arguments about like whether or not ron should take me or him on this abi apocalypse, all kinds of stuff.

Speaker 3:          02:24:49       She's stating the obvious. That wasn't much of an argument. I don't want to have a conversation when you going to provide. I said, I said, I said I would take a tim kennedy's, you know the poisonous mushrooms or something. I do. I know a lot of stuff, but you would take tim kennedy. I said, tim kennedy and I immediately regretted saying as soon as that, because they gave a scenario where all the zombies, everyone's a zombie, so it's only you and one other person, so we couldn't procreate. Right, right. You don't want to take him. I'm pregnant. Rhonda. Saturday. Yeah. Rhonda goes, I'd be a good breeding. She said, your army, you need a breeding. That's true. You'd be breeding warriors. Yeah. That's a good move.

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       Yeah. She's the only choice there a couple of other choices, but for you, that's the only choice. You can't take. Tim kennedy can't get them pregnant. If you were the only two people on earth and yet to fucking die and leave your kids to fend for themselves again, zombies. You might want to take everybody out in their sleep and then do yourself. You might want to fucking end it for real. If you're the last two people on earth and the world is not drown, swim out as far as you can go. That's what I say. just call it out. Fuck that last person on earth being a human being. I know I'm not taking a foxhole. Youtube. As soon as things get a little shady, that's a foxhole. He shot himself foxholes a war. We're talking about everybody being dead except for you in this one chick.

Speaker 2:          02:26:05       What kind of life is that? Your baby behind. You're going to have to fuck your kids. Do you understand that? How procreation works. Someone's going to have to fuck your kids. Your kids are gonna. Have to fuck each other. No, that'd Be the garden. They're going to have to try to survive and they still might get eaten by zombies. Will you guys were given up, but what are you gonna do? You're gonna fuck your kids. You got to keep the reader in a way for other people. Okay. That's what I'm saying. If you know for sure, you'd have to know for sure. Kelly, yourself or you just figure out what this is. I'm here for a reason. What is it? Maybe I can figure something out point though. You wouldn't really know if you know, but you two are given up like I am legend.

Speaker 2:          02:26:41       No, I am. Legend was really like the walking dead, right, the camp at the end and everybody was safe, but those monsters is way scarier than the walking dead. Dead. Sign me up. I'm just going to run everywhere they walk in. I'm going to run it my mind. I'm going to cut down to about one 70. I'm gonna. have a nice pair of kicks and I'm just going to run every cardio, cardio, cardio. That shows a little too moody for me. It's getting ridiculous. They're eating people now. It's like they've found a cannibal fucking colony. it makes sense I guess, but there's plenty of deer left to. It's not like the zombies are eating deer or they eat a few of them, but they can't catch him. I don't understand why everybody gets guns when he could have a sword. I mean it's good to have guns, but that chick never gets fucked with jacks.

Speaker 2:          02:27:27       Everything will you run out of bullets with a sword. You're just chopping heads off. Yeah. You can get a reload. The rifle. It takes a couple of seconds. You gotta fucking 100 zombies coming at you. It takes a long time to put 100 bullets in the chamber. 100 zombies are coming into may take a sword and start to swing it around. Fuck yeah. You take a couple at a tIme and you do it for about an hour and you got 100 dead until you get, until you get the zombie. Like shane carlin, who knows single legs sambisa don't learn anything. They don't even know how to use doors. You don't pay attention. You don't even watch that show. You can't be in this conference. Please exit the conversation so they don't even know unscrewed doors in world war ii, world war z, little different. Those are the scary fast zombie.

Speaker 2:          02:28:08       Yes. that's where we're all screwed. The scary zombies of all time with the 28 days later zombies. You remember that? Not only that, because that's the most likely scenario. It was z. They called it rage. A genetIcally created disease, modify disease. A weaponized disease escapes from the chimps and gets into people and then spreads like wildfire. When you think about what rabies does to to animals and people and people, people, if somebody has rabies and you get them near a body of water, if they get near a body of water, they get so hysterical. You have to chain them down. Really allude. That will go. Why water? I don't know. Are you making this up? Water. Water. They get crazy. Like a huge water phobia from. Oh, they get afraid of the water. When's the last time someone got rabies? Rabies vaccines. Rabies was, You know, I'm talking to now.

Speaker 2:          02:28:58       People have gotten it really recently. Been bit by animals. Yeah. I wonder if rabies Comes from an animal and that animal has memories of drowning. Look it up. Look up. Imagine that shit like we, we're talking about the, the, with the, uh, the mice, the mice giving the, the remembering the smell with the shop part of Your brain where you actually go crazy. First of all, you crazy. That's why the animal will bite you. TheY go crazy. They start to drool and they're just very aggressive. I'm not, I'm not making this up. I had a dog bite me in the ass chicken had rabies when I was a kid. Really? You to get a bunch of shots and guess what? I'm not scared of dogs. you had to get shots in the stomach. The right dog. she'd be scared of snakes. you ever put a. I put a bite suit on and Afghanistan. It had dogs and I've done enough. God, I hate it too. Honestly. Switches it up to see if he's around. By the way, if he's around like real military guys, he takes that shit down. A few doesn't go up. Then they'll go, what do you like? Silence. They think I'm a plant. They think I'm about keto plan. Like, no, they don't think you're a plant. They think you're a fraud.

Speaker 2:          02:30:04       You're a plant. They put a plant on match day. I lived in the middle east eight years of my life. Don't blame me, but um, it's done. Do they release these hydrophobia fear of water. Historic name for rabies. Wow. It's the historic name for rabies refers to a set of symptoms. The later stages of an infection with the victims has difficulty swallowing. Shows panic when presented with liquids to drink and can't quench thirst. Wow. So I guess that's what it is. Like they're scared of water because they know that they got it in their mouth. To suggest I'm drinking may cause excruciating, painful spasms of the muscles in the throat and learn. Wow. Suggestion of drinking may cause excrutiatingly painful spasms and you're really thirsty. Yet you're really thirsty. Great disease, vaccines, vaccines. Yeah, thank you. The effect they can shoot you when you get a bit horrible needles in their stomach. You know, a big giant needles in your fucking stomach. This is another reallY bad, you know the symptoms of tetanus. Look those up. Look up the symptoms of tetanus. That is the worst. Your whole body seizes up and before you die, you're very acutely aware of all the pain that he didn't. You see this shit where a jon jones is requesting that glover to share, get drug tested? Oh no. It's kind of fascinating. He says, uh, agree to a lot of testing. Well,

Speaker 1:          02:31:19       this is what he says. This is exact quote is some fighters you just know they're not on anything just by looking at them. I kind of disagree with that because like guys like that look like Jeremy Horn who doesn't look like he's on anything who have tested positive, like just because a guy has like a certain body type doesn't mean that he can't be on something like got a lot of guys have tested positive. I think you're taLking about the exception there again perhaps, but those are often the guys that wand up taking it like, okay, here's a perfect example, tim silvia. There's tips a lot of folks don't know, like tim silvia tested hot and before tim silvia tested hot. Like look at what he looked like when he fought rico rodriguez. I think that tim silvia that beat rico rodriguez is one of the scariest heavYweights ever.

Speaker 1:          02:32:01       I agree. Tim silvia takedown defense, great strategies to righthand monster. They just, you know, he couldn't keep that fucking hanging off the side and I think he was getting criticized for it and I feel like that's why I did steroid. I think you're right. I think you're right. I mean, he, he'd always wanted to sell it to me. he wanted to look the part, a little embarrassed of his body a little bit, but I also think that it benefited him. It benefited him physically the way he would pull up a pull up. Tim silvia versus rico rodriguez. That's tim when he was retired from the ufc. Now that's tim versus rico rodriguez. you see that? That image. Look how fucking leni wasn't big. He was dangerous motherfucker and he was eating rico's leg kicks and dropping right hands on. Plus the video. If you could find the video.

Speaker 1:          02:32:49       He. He was a scary guy because he. Oh, he also struggled to get down to two 65 for that fight. He was drawing to get down to, to see ms dot wait. He missed wait the first time. Walked around that I don't know him, but he was big. So john saying, not religious big, not fat, but big shoulders and neck. Such a monster. Yeah, exactly. Clover is on stuff. Part of glover to share as mystique is his amazing physical strength and I just questioned it. I have no reason to think he's on steroids, but I do wonder how someone can be so strong. He says, I'm sure I have fought guys in the past that were on steroids. I Think it's pretty well documented. a lot of people haven't really argued with it because they know it's true statement. I know it's a true statement.

Speaker 1:          02:33:35       I called dana white and said, I want glover to take steroid tests for this fight. He asked me, what do you think? He's on steroids, and I told him, I don't know. I have no reason to accuse him of anything, but I would like to be sure. How can you be mad at that? You can't be mad at that. I'm not mad at that at all, and if he came out and was like, hey, glover's on stuff, there's, there's tim, sylvia, when he fought rico. Wow. Look at that big motherfucker to rico. Had a good guard to man are legitimate shadow black belt for sure. Tim silvia was scary back then, man. Super scary and he knocked a lot of guys out. Man. A lot of people sleep on tim silvia. He never gets brought up because he had sort of a dispute with ufc, but

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       head kick, trade telemann knocked him out and tim silvia was not a natural athlete by the way. This is all from toughness in training mean pigeon toed. In fact, his feet like naturally went towards each other and here he stuffs to take down again, rough sum up on the ground and tim silvia back then, you know, I mean, you're dealing with a guy who really. And this is good fucking high guard has to gun. Yeah. And it's like I said, legit brazilian jiu jitsu, black belt, very high level. Especially at the time, you know, at the time, rico was one of very few brazilian jujitsu, black belts in the heavyweight division. There wasn't a lot of guys. You see them sitting noguera's guard risk control. Yup. Yeah, yeah. He, uh, tim silvia at this time I think was one of the scariest guys. I agree with you, but what, you know, who knows how much of it was hard training first of all, for sure it was definitely some steroids and fall to me.

Speaker 2:          02:35:12       He took a look at that, look at that, whipped over for that arm bar. That was pretty fucking sweet. Have that was pretty fucking sweet. Spike some gets out of it. That was a god damn sweet. Armbar rico had a nest. The arm bar. I'Ll tell you what. Rico had a nice little appearance on a slow rehab too. I watched it. All of it. Oh no. With dr. Drew, what was he doing? Drugs. He likes a little booger. Sugar. He likes to have a good time and partying. Yeah. Well, you know what he likes. He likes to have a good time. That tim sylvia rodriguez. I'm not mad. Was a fun guy man. He's a fun guy to hang around with and there's the righthand he starts. He's keeping the fight standing. I'll tell you what, my only experience with rico, only time I ever met him, he was calling in tito ortiz.

Speaker 2:          02:35:55       We're on the same card. And uh, he's looking at the, at the corner and he goes, who in the health? Schwab. Schwab bank, gonzaga. I go right behind you man. He goes, your shower? Yeah. He goes, good luck man. And walks away and I was all, wow, thanks man. Went in there. I beat the brakes off gonzaga for three rounds, striking clinic. Walked back and he's like, damn, great job, man. He gave me a hug, let addict to say that's a fucking mindfuck former ufc heavyweight champion. And I was a fan. I was like, oh, thanks bro. Who said? Oh yeah, that's hilarious. That's hilarious. That's really funny. Funny, right? It made me feel like shit. It's a fucking bad time to feel like shit. Did you see this thing? And tim kennedy fucking tim kennedy, uh, at the press conference. Bisping was swearing at him, fuck you.

Speaker 2:          02:36:47       You fuck you. Fuck this. We're talking about this. Bisping legitimately gently makes a reason to hate you to get ready for the fight. Yeah. Look at this. Meanwhile, you know, who do you have in that fight? He's trying to scare tim kennedy who's been to war. I mean, brennan man. He's killed a lot of bad guys. Like the difference between the fear that he's experienced and the fear of like a fight and the preparation for fight. This is like a vacation for him. It really is a rough, is his mental toughness is not messing. Listen, he as as tough as a human being that gracie had his back, that was cool, like was chill on the pitch, did not care. Double risk and a lot of combat. It's a different world man. That world of firefights in firefights killed bad guys. You know, that's his thing.

Speaker 2:          02:37:38       Fighting [inaudible] probably not that much for life and death. Life and death. I mean there's some of the stories that he tells about his firefights and the things that he can't remember. How many firefights he's been with that. Yeah. And then who do you have in that fight? A good fight. A good fight. Michael bisping has a fucking tremendous pace that he can keep. Michael bisping has a fucking 34 hearts beat per minute. Resting heart rate that's got some credits like the shame he is fit as fuck. It's the opposite came because cain is a freak of nature, man. He really is a freak of nature when it comes to his cardio. You talked to bob cook, he says it came will take like a month off. Get injured. Come back in, outwork everybody, like it doesn't make any sense, like he doesn't have these like breaking periods where he has to get back in shape and some of that is just genetic slips, just like some people have incredible fast twitch muscle fiber.

Speaker 2:          02:38:25       We've met guys that have never lifted weights in there. Fucking gigantic pick cafs and shit like that doesn't even a. But look at cane I w I wouldn't say canes really explosive. He kinda has that softer body. Whereas the insurance is going to be higher. It's 100 percent genetics. Yeah. Well he definitely doesn't have the same kind of. You guys like hector lumbar, right? Who's just jack to the gills. His ears have fricking traps. You know, you just like swole. All explosiveness. Nolan's more explosive than hector. I agree. He's the most explosive guy that's ever fought in mma right up there with melvin manhoef. I think he's even more exposed to the melbourne. I think so too, because of the judo and they said, hector, your giant swole muscles. Let's give you the vegan jake shields. Let's see how this goes. Fight and fight. Well, jagan steroids on its neck.

Speaker 2:          02:39:13       Jake caught his neck with the last remaining second fight was hanging on. Jake's got a god damn vice for a grip. When he gets that good team, man, he tightened that shit up on robbie lawler. He tightens that shit up on everybody and you don't think he's going to be able to get it. Like there's a lot of guys think they can get out of that. Yeah. Jake jacobs strong. Going to train with them on friday and san francisco. I'm hector lombard. Motherfucker hit some judo throws in this light against jake shields that you just like a ragdoll them. If ever there's a reason why. Hey dad, why can't I look at this? Boom, why watch that again, just back that up again and just back that up to that judo toss to back it up all the way to do this in a world class grappler like jake shields is just insane. Watch this. He does it so beautifully. Perfect technique and speed and he's one of those storms of like athleticism and technique and really started striking once he was already an olympic judo.

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       That's when he started striking, so he prefers to keep fight standing just because he's such a fucking specimen. Oh, you won't be a vegan. I'm going, I'm going to play that tape for you, but be here. Watch this fight. Like in all fairness, when you talk about a style like jake shields is kinda like what we were talking about could be a worse match up. Yeah. They were trying to get rid of them. Well I don't think so. They were just trying to give him a fight that was going to be a really tough fight. I mean look, they just, it's like if you want to be in the top 10 and he wanted a title shot, like if he beat book, what if he caught him with that team the first round and finished it. You know, he's likely in the short list for a title shot.

Speaker 1:          02:40:49       If he could finish a guy basically five, that'd be $500. You see a guy like hector lumbar, that style of fucking sprinting. You can't do it for three rounds. Can do it for five rounds. Fight tyron woodley, woodley. He's fighting rory. Rory mcdonald versus willie's a fantastic fight, especially if the rory that beat damien maia shows up. If rory is motivated and aggressive, he's gotta. Get the fuck away from woodland. That first round though, buddy and woodley. It's, you know, woodley can move as fast as any fucking human being in the ufc. I don't care if the 135 pounds at one 70, that fucking dude can move like a fast one. 30 five is that, that explosive. He's as big as you can ever get and be a world class hundred and 70 pounder. And it's an interesting situation because, you know, there's, there's a lot of like, uh, there was debate after I talked about it on the, uh, on the broadcast about this body type.

Speaker 1:          02:41:46       It has its benefits for sure as far as explosion and speed, but it also has a lot of requirements like for oxygen. Yeah. And it's like, can a guy take it deep into the rounds? What happens if a guy survives fourth and fifth? Because when nate beat them, they beat him in the fourth round. Marquardt stopped him in strikeforce welterweight title fight. And that's what happened is nate caught him slowing down and nate, nate then was before he's had a couple of these bad knockouts, like the knockout against hector, lumbar toughest to get knocked out. He was when he fought tyron woodley. You're talking about nate marquardt who was at his best and but it's back against the wall too because he had been kicked out of the ufc, finally gets back into strikeforce and he gets a shot at the title at strikeforce. It's a big fight and you know, nate was primed.

Speaker 1:          02:42:32       It was in his prime. But you know, look, a guy like tyron woodley who is a superior athlete, he's just an elite athlete, is still learning the mma skills. But it's like what we were talking about before is that what you're seeing now is guys who are on an athletic level, like you've never had the ufc before, but go back to ufc one and you know, you watched like, you know, some of these guys who as decent athletes, good athletes, you know, tough guys and had incredible balls to get into the ufc at that time. Put tyron woodley and ufc one crazy, crazy, crazy. Ain't taking that dude down now there's no, that's not happening at the top. There's nothing happening. Evolution of the sport. Yeah. I mean if you watch when tyron woodley

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       beat like jay hiran know one existed that could move that fast until recently. No one existed in the ufc like within the last five, six years. You're starting to see these guys trickle in that have that kind of explosion of that kind of athleticism, that kind of speed. And hector is right up there. Heck, it's like hector entirely. So it's like as someone who analyzes fights and it analyzes like there's a point of diminishing returns, like what's the best body type? Is it super muscular like hector lombard? Or is it like a carlos condit guy that's super durable and king last round after round, you know, and the woodley fight, we saw woodley one me, he fucked up tyrons knee. It's a. But look, it wasn't really a fight. His leg fell off, his leg got hurt in the take down and then he heard it again when he led kitchen.

Speaker 2:          02:43:56       It's not the same as him beating him, like with no injuries, but the bottom line is he wins. He wins j. You know what I mean? You can't, you can't really. You know what I mean? Like you can't quantify it the same way as a knockout or submission. It's similar to cane versus brock lesnar. One guy's just swole to the gills. The other guy, if you, if you saw him with his shirt off, you're like, there's no way you're the best except the fact that, you know, would they was still there in the second round, you know, and he's still going at it in the second round, you know? And that's, you're right, you're right about that. There's gotta be a balance like too muscular has its liabilities and there's a. It's like they had that debate about what's the perfect way for the heavyweight boxer?

Speaker 2:          02:44:33       When you get to a certain weight, you start losing speed and power. So is it 2:30, 2:40 2:35? It depends on the body. You know, I think bo jackson tell you what number. Bo jackson at 2:45. That freaky ashlyn. He would have, he would have been probably the, that's probably the optimal, the optimal. And you know what he does now? Bow hunts. Yeah, he does. That's his shit. Talked to him about hunting for. Oh, I don't know. About two hours. Did you live in jackson? That's what you talked about. Hunting and he talks about he wants to talk about. That's what, uh, that's what he wants to talk about. Like he's obsessed with the way we talked about football and baseball too. You better auburn football. Been winning. And I said about football. He said, he said, he said, well, I never left the. And I played football.

Speaker 2:          02:45:19       He was six. He was about six to 2:45 then. And, and, and I said, why? He goes, he goes, I just scrapped it all and I just go in there and I'd hear them whispering, posted the game post in the game. He was just run through to. He said, baseball is way harder than he thought it was. As he thought of it as a very, very cerebral game. Way more. So here's bowhunting. Here's bono's hunting in a tree myself. Not only enjoys hunting big bucks, but he loves to shoot a few arrows in between. Shoot a few arrows. How bad are these narrators and these fucking hunting shows? Can we get better production? No, no. They get a dollar an episode put together which you to pay for your flight on southwest. You get out there. The film. This shit with fucking handycams. Oh my god. Fast forward to this so we don't have to hear it. Just get to the part where both shoots it. Here it is. Wonder if he can pull back on that pump after she doesn't feel it.

Speaker 2:          02:46:17       He's moving nice and slow. Straight up. Killer. Look at boats. yeah, that's a light bulb because he's pulling it back at night. There's about an inch high. Oh, he's in. Isn't a tree. Boom. Yeah. Hey, I got an idea. Next time you bring bo jackson up, let's show some highlights of him destroying guys on the football field. Killing. That's what he likes. Now he likes doing that and I'm like bow jackson anymore because both jackson bow hunts, you know jackson, super boring. You know what I find is fascinating. Herschel. mother fucking walker, almost 50 years. Jack his last fight when he was like 49. It's st by the way. Take a look at his body, man against the broncos doing work shredded. You don't want to see him sitting in a tree. He's a super athlete shooting, shooting a deer with walkers. Ridiculous. He started when he was young. We'd all, we'd all be no shit. Right? He'd rip people's faces of. Is that hershel walker? It's incredible that he had mma fights in strikeforce. Deep into. It's so crazY. Give you pull up at herschel walker mma fight. Get crazy. Look at that. Look at that. Let's thanking god. He know he's shredded, but he's fighting billy billy from kinko's who best to the arena and tossed on the mouthpiece and whooped his ass. He was fighting notch guys. Fight. Chad griggs. Who did. Who did herschel walker fight

Speaker 2:          02:47:43       you? I mean, what are you saying? Chad? Greeks is world class, but I know that's what I'm saying. He's a very good fighter. The jet fighter. Chet griggs is legit. Don't you? Shit on him. You son of a bitch. I'm not shitting on anybody who's he fighting here? Some pretty good guard, man.

Speaker 4:          02:48:00       Oh yeah. That was the dam. He was big.

Speaker 2:          02:48:10       Forty eight years old here. Just completely shredded. It's just there's a difference in athleticism, man. When you get to this level, when you get to like a herschel walker, you're dealing in a hundred first. All I talked about this in jujitsu, there's black belts and then there's the one percent black belts who like booze shesha haji and yes, those guys. So he was to make it to the nfl. You're the one percent of all football players. He was the one percent of one percenters. Nfl. That's insane. Insane. And one percent of one percent or one at a time. And right now all we watch them on, strikeforce beat up some poor white guy who has no business being in the scarf cars. Scott carson and greg nagy are the guys that he fought and he never. He never followed Chad. Greg. So my apologies. Can you calm down and you over there?

Speaker 2:          02:48:59       I'll take brian or you didn't. You didn't. You fight like some guys that maybe didn't have the base 52. Yeah. No, he is a monster. Don't get me wrong. Still looks great. Yes. I would take his bottles of wine, tea, our tea. It doesn't take that. You sure? He also says he's surprised also says that he only eats a bowl of soup and a salad at dinner as well. But he eats other stuff. Oh no. Somebody says exercise is always been a religion to him. Like, well, you know, he also had like a, an issue or trauma related issue with like multiple personality disorder. I didn't. Yeah, he had something that was going on. I heard about this. Yeah. It was going on before he had an mma career and everybody was like, wait a minute. If he's had a trauma related, um, multiple personality disorder here, I'll pull that up. Yeah, yeah. Mercy, multiple personality disorder. Yeah. He, um. Then they started fighting, said, you know, I'm bipolar. This is, let's take punches to the face. Yeah. It's cnn Way back in. When was this article out in 2008. He, uh, he put out a book about it and it was a book about his multiple personalities and they believe that, I believe it's trauma related. I should probably google that too.

Speaker 5:          02:50:14       Um, I don't think that, I mean,

Speaker 2:          02:50:18       I'll be honest, since I've started fighting, I'm a little one more serious, little, little quicker trigger for sure. If something's getting on my nerves I'm with on there with them. I'm, I used to be super more laid back, I'd say. Okay. Says usually has its roots in childhood trauma. Okay. So that might not mean head injury. It might mean like abuse child cope with trauma or abuse. hm.

Speaker 5:          02:50:41       I don't know.

Speaker 2:          02:50:45       And also it has to do with ptsd, ptsd. So I guess it is talking about abuse, about um, not, not physical, not like, hey, I'm being treated, but I mean, just think about the amount of head trauma that you have to get playing football at a high level. It's unavoidable. There's no right, you did it. It's unavoidable, unavoidable. It's really, it's practice. It's the practice that does it. How many times do you think you got concussions while playing football?

Speaker 2:          02:51:09       Oh, five or six and not that many. I was smart about it. You're aware of this kind of crazy at five or six. This is like a low end for and I played fullback h back where your. See if you guys know the position, you're constantly running five. It's ridiculous now. I think about five yards apart. You run as fast as you can into that. Go with your head first. That's what I was doing nonstop. She christ. That's crazy. Again, why wouldn't someone sent me? Now I'm like running. Listen man. I don't think it's beneficial for your life, but you to that guy. But meanwhile you had success at that. That lead you to success in college? Yeah. Well, I said to him, I asked him if he would have traded his football career and for training and man, he said no because you could just talk now. Not back then. There's just the competition level wasn't. I'm saying it taught you that you've learned how to be a dude. I was training with killers. You know, you're talking about some of the very best athletes in the world day in, day out competing. We're competing on the field competing, so I just learned mental toughness. You can't pay for that at the time in 2001, 2000. There wasn't that in mma. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Wow. Fun times boys. This is a fun fucking podcast and three hours just to do it.

Speaker 2:          02:52:24       Yeah, let's do that. Let's do some posts. Ufc podcast. We'll do that. Let's meet in a couple of weeks after jon jones fight. Glover. Okay. April. Not this weekend coming up, but the weekend after that. That's do it. Yeah. Let's do that. Let's do a post ufc wrap, right? We'll, we'll, we'll sit down and discuss it and talk about the undercard and all the shit that's coming up. Let's do it and how floyd mayweather. We get tapped out by ronda rousey go. We didn't even talk about that. We didn't even get into that much time. We have left. How many minutes? We can talk about it for a couple. How much minutes? We have left. Five. We have five minutes. Do this. Yeah, there was a comparison. No, it's not even a fight. If you learned how to have takedown defense, he would have to work on that for a long time.

Speaker 2:          02:53:01       But, um, the uh, the people online are freaking out. I was on sports nation today. Great job. They asked me great show max kellerman. That's fucking awesome. I love that guy. He's such a good. The best boxing channel used to be a rapper. Yeah. Yeah. Him and his brother, right? Yeah. Yeah. His brother was murdered by a boxer that they were, that he was a roommate with. Yeah. It's terrible story. Yeah. What do you mean the guy killed them? Killed them with like a hammer. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know the full story. I read it online, but, uh, rhonda deStroying floyd mayweather. that would 100 percent happen. It's again, like we were talking about like, I can't play tennis. I don't know how to play tennis. I played tennis with someone who knows what they're doing. I'm going to get slaughtered. If you don't know judo and if you don't know how to grapple, you don't know.

Speaker 2:          02:53:47       Take down defense and he will let that grow. Clench with you. You're going flying. I've seen ronnie get ahold of mma professional men, 215, 220 pounds tosses them.
