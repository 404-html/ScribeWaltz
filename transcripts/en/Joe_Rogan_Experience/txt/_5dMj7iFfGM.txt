Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Must be from New York. Yeah. Well you could definitely tell that four, three, two. And we're live. John Joseph, how are you? This is like, I'm excited and I'm excited to for. I think it could set a nice precedent because there's so much fucking toxic energy between vegans and non vegans. Even if we're just joking around, people get so fucking angry and it's not necessary.

Speaker 2:          00:00:27       Absolutely. I mean, where's the humor? Where's the comedy? Yeah. I mean, the other thing is I don't sit around like I'm not defined by what the fuck I eat. Like, like this dude said, how come you don't call yourself a Vegan? I'm like, because I do a lot more shit than just eat plant based food is part of what I do.

Speaker 1:          00:00:46       But don't you call yourself a Vegan? Me. You are a Vegan, right?

Speaker 2:          00:00:48       Uh, I practiced that a lifestyle for sure. But I don't call myself a Vegan. Um, that's interesting. I would say people say, uh, you know, how do you, I don't like to put any type of material laid label on myself and if somebody says to me and push the issue, I'm like, I'm more of a higher Krishna Bhakti Yoga person than I am a Vegan, you know, even though I don't wear animal products, I don't use animal products. I eat a plant based diet, 100 percent, um, but uh, to call myself, that just puts me in some, you know, some shelf, oh, it's just another Vegan or whatever the fuck, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       it seems to me as though people are always searching for an identity and if they have an identity that I'm a, I'm a carnivore, I'm on the carnivore diet, which has all the latest trends and then people get really hopped up on that and that's all they want to do is talk carnivore diet to the difference between what's happening right now with this carnivore diet. And vegans seems very similar to me in that they're very into the identity of their food, not their food choices, but certainly into the fact that this is how they identify. They talk about it all the time and I just think this photo, there's pitfalls in that. There's traps that people fall into where they lock their identity into a group. Absolutely. And this is what happens with vegans, it happens to hunters. It happens with Republicans, happens with Democrats. It just becomes a group thing. And then you automatically oppose people, the other group, and you have like, you have a conflict with them, you have hate with them.

Speaker 2:          00:02:27       Do we need more walls? You don't need more adults. And I'll tell you what really got it for me. And I started doing this in [inaudible] 81 before anybody. I came out of incarceration. I came out of abusive foster homes. My father was a professional fighter, tried to murder my mom, peter continuously. I didn't even find out I, you know, that I was conceived that of a rape from him on my mom. So getting locked up, hitting the streets and then meeting the bad brains in 1980 and seeing them and who they were surrounded by. It was a lot of uh, you know, people who were into very metaphysical stuff. So I got into the yoga and I know you've been doing yoga now too. So one of the first tenants of the yoga practice, which slams all it ish. All this label shit is a Hump Brahmasmi that I'm actually, my identity is a spirit soul.

Speaker 2:          00:03:22       It beyond anything in the material world, any label you want to put on yourself. So that's really where I come from with the whole thing. And I think the toxicity level that is existing now just because of what people fucking, you know, choose to eat. I mean I have my issues with a certain things that are being done because of, because of the condition of the planet and we're not being good custodians of this planet that were in charge for kids and future generations. What's being done now. There's industries that are destroying the planet. Like, you know, some of it is irreparable damage being done, but I really try to keep it metaphysical, uh, with everything I do and who I help. I mean, I'm working on a documentary right now at here, 30 year life with hardcore fucking ex cons. I just did 20, 25 years, 30 years.

Speaker 2:          00:04:18       If I go in there trying to preach them some Vegan shit to them, um, I'm coming out. I'm like a fucking like, Yo, dude, this is where I've been. I, I've been where you are. People helped me and I'm, I'm here to help you. I, we didn't start out. You know, we don't even say, you know, we said, you know, we're going to put you on a plant based Diet. What are you going to do? Tell them don't wear leather. Fucking shoes. Don't do this. Don't, do you know the whole thing. Even when Jay z and beyonce is never enough. Okay. They went and did you know they said Vegan, right? Okay. We were practicing a Vegan Diet. We're doing a 30 day Vegan. So what are the vegans do? Attack them all, but he fucking leather and it's, you have to be able to find the spark.

Speaker 2:          00:05:03       So if you see some goodness in someone, you have to be able to fan that spark, not throw water on it. And that's the problem that's being done is people are so judgmental because they've built this walls, the walls between them that um, it's just for finding. And I was telling the guys, I trained them this morning, we're doing this 30 to life. We kipp in Anniston and we're at the amity foundation where these guys got paroled. And I said, look, there's two types of mentality in the world. There's the Bema mentality that's looking for the sweet and the good in people. And then there's the flies and they looking for the shit. I said, when you see shit on a sidewalk and a dog takes a shit or in New York, uh, you know, a human takes a shared within a matter of fucking 20 seconds.

Speaker 2:          00:05:51       There's flies on that motherfucker. So I try to roll with the PMA, which I learned from bad brains, positive mental attitude, which Napoleon Hill, her copped it from Napoleon Hill, think and grow rich and all those books on self out. And it was like he told me no matter what circumstances you may be in. And I was in the navy at the time in Norfork fucking smuggling, fucking up catching cases came out and took, took navy over, going back to jail. And I was fucking up. I didn't know what to do. Fuck out of my mind hanging out with Henry rollins and Ian Mci and all those guys in the DC hardcore scene in New York punk scene and you know, hanging with John Belushi on fear that night. We were the ones that wreck the set of Saturday night live and just, you know, the just doing crazy shit.

Speaker 2:          00:06:40       And he was just told me, you know, whatever you may be going through in life, if you keep a positive mental attitude, you could get through anything. So how am I going to criticize people just because, uh, you, you eat meat or do whatever. It's like, you know, and some of these people are hardcore Christians and it's like you're supposed to say, hey, what, you know, hate the sin, not the sinner or whatever the fuck that whole philosophy deals with. I mean, my point is I'm trying to knock down the walls between people and unify people, so

Speaker 3:          00:07:11       I think what you do good is you, you're a very positive role model in terms of hard work, in terms of your, your, your mental fortitude and how you approach things and I think people need that and I think one of the things that's going on right now with social media and one of the reasons why people will attack Jay z four and leather shoes, even though they're, they're looking to stand out, they're looking to be virtuous. They're looking to be the person that's more virtuous than the person. We're pointing a finger at, man, fuck them. And there's always a lot of fuck people who aren't this or fuck people who aren't that. She'd never say fuck people because people are. They're just like you. They're human beings and everybody's on a different path. Tell me why you believe the way you believe. Tell me why you think the way you think, and I'll tell you why.

Speaker 3:          00:07:53       I think the way I think and I bet we'll find common ground and that's what human beings need to do more with each other. The problem with social media is it gives us this them this unusual platform to get people to pay attention to their ideas when maybe their ideas aren't even that good or maybe their ideas are very obvious. You know, like you're gonna appointed someone, hey man, you know you shouldn't say this word. Hey man, you shouldn't do this thing because that we've decided that that's a bad thing. We've decided that that's culturally unacceptable anymore and now everyone's gonna attack for that very reason. Instead of describing how they feel, what makes them feel when they say something, what makes them feel when they do things, where what's going on in their head so we can all relate on common ground. People just want to attack and it's a big problem with social media is way too young. It's a new thing and people are using it and he's really fucked up ways. They don't exactly know what they're doing while they're doing it. They're not even aware of the effect of their printed word. What's going to have. That's why you have so many trolls and so many mean people and so many people just trying to get a rise out of someone. They're not even aware of the process they're setting in motion.

Speaker 2:          00:08:55       They just know they could push a button and watch something happened that just going, Ooh, I mean this is, this is a lot of what's going on today. I mean, and some of this stuff is, is destroying people's lives. What they fucking do. And they don't. They don't realize that, um, you know, it, it's a shame because, uh, like when I was growing up, we didn't have social media, there was no motherfucking Internet, there was no, none of you know, I remember I had the first pager. It was fucking gigantic. So like, we didn't even have no internet. Everything was word of mouth. And if you wanted to catch shows, if you wanted to do this, if you had a beef with somebody, you didn't go on fucking social media and talk a bunch of bullshit, you fucking walked up to the person and you said, hey, here I am and what the fuck, let's let's deal with this.

Speaker 2:          00:09:44       Let's talk about it, talk it out. But now you got people buying followers and do another. It's just that it's, you know, it's just the most toxic environment in a lot of ways. And it's a shame because it could be used. And that's why I never post negative shit. I tried to use the platform, you know, make light of Shit and not have a stick up your ass. There's too many people that do even the plant based Vegan thing and everything so fucking serious. I'm like, you might reach more people if you lightened up, you know, like stripes. Lighten up Francis. Yeah. I think if you say you eat meat, well you did write a book called me this proposal. I'll tell you how that came about. And actually I got attacked. I'm going to tell you something else you want to talk about destroying people.

Speaker 2:          00:10:32       I got attacked more by the Vegan feminists for that book. Fucking tried to destroy me, everybody because I wrote push now first of all. And then she, she went on a blog and called me a misogynistic. I said, yeah, like massages the but you know, call me and misogynistic scumbag and then fucking piece of shit and all this. So I just had, I just wrote a, Hey, any of you ladies that bought this book for the, for the fellows and it helped them please fucking Holler at this fucking woman and tell some. They shut her fucking blog down. And then she called me a maniac and I said, let's call Germanium. Send people on her the way she sent, but dig this. And then I said, we have, we have a saying on the streets in New York back in the day. Don't start nothing. There won't be none.

Speaker 2:          00:11:15       I say, you know, but the thing was, I'm going to tell you how that book title came about because it was a woman actually Karen Rinaldi from a Harper Collins wave. And what happened was, uh, I was training at crunch. Aaron Dragos Winooski is my trainer and he's gotten me through all my fucking Iron Mans, everything. I was a fucking broken up person, injuries all this shit. So I'm working. I was working at crunch and training with him. And then another person, a friend of mine, all the five points guys used to be there. You would see them all. They had a ring on the second floor. So this guy was doing pad work and I'm telling them, hey, you know, listen man, you got a fight coming up, man, get on the chlorophyll, get onto wheat grass, get on, you know, eat as much recovery foods as you can that's going to fight inflammation.

Speaker 2:          00:12:01       So some fucking Momma Luke with fucking 19 eighties tiger striped pants. Fuck it. Fuck you. You know, you're like, he, he, he just took everything out of context. And then he's like, you're fucking people that don't want me to fucking pussies, you know, my uh, yeah, you got like 50 pounds on me, but if you want to put some head gear and get in the ring, I'll oblige you. He's like, what? I said I don't eat meat bro. And then the funny shit with the whole book title was it was going to be called to grow green road to health, fitness and longevity and business partner Todd Erland goes, motherfucker, who are you? Dr Oz. Nobody wants to hear that book. Familiar John Blood Clot Joseph singer from the Cro mags they want. And then I post it, they will. And then I said, yeah. I said, yeah, this motherfucker was like, you know, saying fucking people that don't eat me to push these on my motherfucker.

Speaker 2:          00:12:57       That dude ain't seen his dick in fucking 10 years. He was overweight and all this shit. I said that motherfuckers to pussy. And he's like, Yo, you know what? Throw it back in her face. And I was like, I don't know man. That's, you know, that's a pretty bold statement. He said, do it. Do it. So we released so right away to fuck and emails and the texts that way. Yo, that's how it started. And then we uh, our agent Dan, we got hooked up with this guy, Dan from ICM. He's like, met my business partner in the Hamptons. She's like, Yo, that book is fucking dope man. I think we could get a deal within a week. He had four offers. So you wrote it first? Yeah, I wrote it first and we put it out. So it was the thought process behind writing it.

Speaker 2:          00:13:42       You just had a lot of shit in your head. Just wanted to get out. Yeah. Well I studied writing under Robert Mckee, so I wrote my memoir first. Interesting. Yeah. Story. I fucking that guys like my guru for writing. I, I took, I took the story seminar twice. He's fucking amazing. I mean Brian Cox, his portrayal of him and fucking in a adaptation fucking brilliant spot on. So. And you know, I, I actually became friends with Robert with Mr Mckee. I would. He smoked like crazy. Realized. Yeah. He smoked cigarettes. I A fucking CIM lot of writers do, man. Yeah, but not during the class. So when he had the breaks he would fucking do like two, three cigarettes. I said, you know, my friend has an organic green tea extract company and the Polyphenols in that is going to counteract all your fucking smoking shit that you're doing.

Speaker 2:          00:14:30       So I gave him five bottles and then every time he would call, he would have his people call Yo, you know that guy fucking Miguel and get them to bring me some more of that green tea shit. Did he quit smoking? I don't know. I haven't seen him in. The problem is it gives them a charge. Some, uh, you know, a nootropic charge fires up your brain. Yeah. It's a smoke a cigarette man. I smoked like crazy. I used to Kools in lock up and shit, like, you know, because that's what they gave you in Spofford. And uh, and when I went upstate it was, cools quit. I quit because I started boxing in lock up and they would have us run this fucking hill called suicide hill and I will be fucking puking. And I was like, I gotta quit fucking smoking. So I quit smoking, they used to do smoker fights in lockup.

Speaker 2:          00:15:15       So if you had a beef with somebody you went into this rec room was explained smokers to people, they don't know what that means. Smoker, fights means you just have a beef with somebody and you could just throw on the gloves and, and go at it. And as long as it's like reasonably within 20 pounds of weight difference, like, you know, although in lockup I saw people much bigger people fighting much smaller people in, some of them guys. I mean I was, I was not good. I got, I would fight the black dudes and they would just beat the shit out of me, but I would just keep coming back. You know, I'm Irish, I don't quit man. I was [inaudible] then, you know, I learned more of the sweet science and you know, went into the navy and. And so you quit smoking just for boxing.

Speaker 2:          00:16:00       I quit smoking A. Yeah, for that, for that reason. But when I was locked up, I didn't quit almost to the end because towards the end of your sentence, they allow you to go home because they want to reintegrate you back with your family or whatever. And I never grew up with my mom so they would send us home. So we would take the continent cigarettes and opening up very carefully, open up the cellophane, carefully slide the cellophane down and put joints inside the cigarette pack, slide it back up, glue it closed the cart and cigarettes. And that's how we would get the feedback from the visits because I wasn't smoking weed coming back out of. Nobody's asked. That was, I'm like, no, thank you. So, uh, that, you know, so that was the process and um, you know, so that's why, that's why I quit. But that's the book came, uh, I had a lot of shit, a lot of demons inside of me from what happened to me, me and my two brothers was, you know, pretty severely abused and all kinds of ways in his foster home, physically, mentally, sexually abused by the older kids in the home.

Speaker 2:          00:17:06       It was fucked up and I never told anybody, but that was always something, no matter how much I lived as a monk for two years or Hari Krishna Monk, nothing, a cure, that fucking anger that was inside of me that I had toward these people for what they did to me. And the secret of like, Yo, it's fucked up to say like, Yo, Yo, Yo, just do from the streets. You had knife fights with Puerto Rican. I, I got shot with a 22 and forest parks on angel dust. I got stabbed and then to try to say, Yo, this motherfucker molesting me is wwe. It took a lot out of me too. And nobody knew it because I never talked about it. And I took my keys class and that was the turning point because I went up to him and I was writing a script at the time based on what happened to me in the foster home.

Speaker 2:          00:17:52       The kids in the screenplay. We based, uh, what, what happened to me, uh, in, in my younger, a period of my life. And I never told anybody what happened. I would just avoid that, but then when I wrote, I started writing the book and I was taking his class and between, uh, you know, parts of his thing, when you went on a break, you could walk up to Robert Mckee and say, ask him questions. So I said, Mr Mckee as far as a protagonist who was abused as a kid and he stopped me right there and he said, listen, stop. Right Day said McGowan, everybody uses it. It's a cliche, you know, abusive children, uh, to develop empathy for characters we could otherwise not give a fuck about. It's not what happens to somebody, it's what they do as a result of it. And that's the fucking light came on.

Speaker 2:          00:18:45       And I mean, for years I would sit there and it took me seven years to write the evolution of a cro magnon and I would get to that part of the story and I will lose my shit and break down crying like fucking uncontrollably because of what happened to me and my brothers. So I just skipped over that part and I would never address it. But then, you know, he gave me the strength and a lot of ways to be able to say, hey man, you got to tee. He wrote in my book, so I have his book and he wrote to me, he goes, John always write the truth and that's when I knew that that needed to come out in the book to cleanse myself. I've been two years on crack, a 88, 88 to 90 crack pills, you know, doing whatever getting shot at with fucking ear fifteens robin deals.

Speaker 2:          00:19:40       I had a tos or not. It was chaos at the time, kill on site. I was, I was a fucking maniac because I just didn't care. I actually kind of wish subconsciously that somebody would put a fucking bullet at me. We're doing crack. A lot of people get molested. They almost act out to the point where they want someone else to do it for them because they don't want to. Yeah, I was definitely in a lot of ways that's what I was doing. But when I took a his, when that seminar helped me so much because it's really like, he's really like a fucking a guru and a teacher man. The man is amazing. If you ever get a chance to take the Robert Mckee story seminar, two, three day seminar. I took it twice, then he does workshops. But the story seminar, I just walked out of there after the third day is 10 hours a day and you're just like, you fucking, you like speeches.

Speaker 2:          00:20:31       Like what the fuck did I just experience? It's incredible. And, and that gave me the power to go and tell my story the right way and the amount of emails of people that I received that will like, Yo, that shit was done to me. Thank you for having the courage to tell the story. And um, you know, I just kept writing after that. So even the meat is for pussies. A book was, you know, if you read it, it's tongue and cheek. I'm not calling. There's a lot of dudes that eat meat that could kick the shit out of me. I'm not saying what I'm saying is if you continue to lead a sanitary lifestyle and you eat this fucked up food that's out there that they're putting out there, that they are knowingly putting out there to fucking poison you because they're tied in with the pharmaceutical companies. It's a racket. It's it, it's not a conspiracy has been proven that this is what they're doing. You will become a pussy dependent on the pharmaceutical companies to keep you alive. If you, if that's what you want, then this book is not for you. Put it back. So you

Speaker 3:          00:21:30       got into Hari Krishnas and you got into this whole consciousness trip from the bad brains, which is crazy. Like think about that. Like people would assume like, you think the hardcore scene you think at a drugs and violence and tattoos and namaste and you are getting into that. So tell me about that. How'd you get into Hari Krishnas?

Speaker 2:          00:21:49       I'm going to tell you. So, um, initially my first and my first interaction with Rastafarian's, it was 1980. So I went to my ship was going to Jamaica. So when you go to any, when you go take this, let's say you go to any port and they take you down on the mess deck and they show everyone, you go here, you go there, they're like, they show you these films. So when we were getting ready to go to Jamaica, they're like, if you're going to use, and it's these like military films from like the sixties, if you're gonna use, uh, you know, have sex with a prostitute and make sure you use a prophylactic. And then the next photo was a fucking Rastafari in with smoke coming out of every fucking or FIS. And they're like, and under no circumstances should you talk to these people, they're just going to try to sell you drugs.

Speaker 2:          00:22:38       So who the fuck do you think was the first people I went when I got off the ship because I didn't hang out with like any of the dudes on my ship. I got the fuck away from. I was the only punk rocker. I was wearing sex pistols, destroy fucking tee shirts. They're looking at me like I was already into punk rock since the seventies. So I get off the ship and I meet this like 20 something year old fucking dread, dread dude. And he's like, yeah, mom, what you need? I said, listen, I, you know, I'm fucking smuggling some weed back. I, I wanna I want to get, take [inaudible] this other sale at told me, Yo, you go in there and you get them to take you to the carving shops and they carve out the fucking statue and they packed the lamb's bread in there and then seal up the statue.

Speaker 2:          00:23:21       And then I had a hookup with uh, the officer, the guy who did the watch and counted. So say every fifth person you got searched. So I was always avoided that because I will hit the dude off with some weed or whatever the fuck it was. So when I went to Jamaica, I asked this kid as soon as I got off the boat, like there was no hotels in Montego Bay, nothing. It was just, you took the ship, the ship anchored out in the bay and you took a boat in and landed at the dock. And it was just like some fucking ancient, like crazy shit like that you would see back in $1,800 for sale report and then there's two was eating his carton a fucking shit. I might kill 'em. I'm like French fries and Burgers at the time. And I'm like, Yo, what the fuck are you eating?

Speaker 2:          00:24:07       What is that shit? He's like, yeah, I'm on this color, Lou and Aki. And he's like Manya, he shall live to 150 to Ross. I was like, really? I said, let me check that shit out. Took one fork full. And I just was like, that's fucking disgusting. Shit. Tastes like dirt dude. What was it? It was Carla Lou Lou Lou is a green. It's like one of the most nutritious, Collard Green. Yeah, it's like Collard Green. It's like they have a day of Greens down there that don't really grow anywhere else. So I think it's like a combination of Kale and Collard Greens. And then Aki is like this fruit and it looks like it's yellow. It looks like an egg almost. But if you eat Aki when it's not ripe, you'll die. You get poisoned. It's this type of thing. Like when the fruit opens up the. It's like a red fruit.

Speaker 2:          00:24:57       If you eat it when it's not open, you will die. Really? Yeah. Aki Aki will poison you. And then. And then he was eating seaweed and beans and anyway, so I went up into the hills. He took me. Now I don't know if you like reggae, but I do. I fucking love Gregory. So do you know where Peter Tosh? I'm wanted shredder alive. Do you know where that came from? No. Okay. I'm going to tell you. So back in, I think it was 78, this cop, they hate the roster foreigns in Jamaica by the way, because it's a big Christian. The Christians invaded that place and just fucking turned everybody into dogmatic fucking thinking people to judo. You know the what the white man does everywhere across the planet. You got to be my religion. Fuck everybody else. This is what's up. So they did that dad. So I'm what they call the Jamaicans.

Speaker 2:          00:25:52       What the rosters called the Jamaicans who don't grow knots. They call them ball heads, man. You know, like Bob Marley, crazy ball head. So what they did with these guys, uh, a, a cop tried to kill Ross, the foreign and the roster foreign killed a cop so they put a bounty on every single Rastafari and wanted dead or alive. You could kill a roster and drag him to the precinct and collect a reward. So all the rosters fled up into the hills and it was called the Greenbay killings. They just started killing all these rastafarian's it. And so this guy brought me up into the hills and I met these rosters and the Nyabinghi, the drummers and all that shit. And the guy had the actual, because it was only like two, maybe three years prior to me going there in 1980 and I got to meet like these cats that survived that shit.

Speaker 2:          00:26:41       And they had the news and all this shit. So that was like my first experience with the whole roster thing. And then I met the bad brains one night at first Ian Mci and all them cats came down with teenagers and untouchables. That was Henry's whole crew first. I know Henry's been on here, I'm pretty good friends with him and our next week tell him I said, well, started fucking love him man. He's a fucking great human being. He's a beast. And yeah, he was like, when I split the baby he let me stay at his house and I was eating his food and then after a week of him going to work and coming home and his food's gone. He's like, all right, John, you gotta, get the fuck out. Go somewhere. Not here. But uh, they played and then a week later, uh, I used to go during the middle of the day, uh, in my car in the navy and go to happy hour and I'm walking in and the owner comes out.

Speaker 2:          00:27:34       He's like, you got to shoot this fucking band. You got to see this band. I'm like, all right, cool. I'm going in. He's like, no, you don't understand their fucking black man and there. They're incredible. So I go upstairs and bad brains are sound checking and I'm just like, what the fuck is this? And if you haven't seen the bad brains, I'll tell you the best video to watch. Nineteen 80 to cbgbs they got the whole set up there. And if you want to have your shit blown away, just watch that. So that's what, uh, I actually sold their, their manager acid. I was selling acid at the time. So they manage. I sold him acid, but I got to talk with her and he started telling me about this pma shit. And, and I told him, hey man, I fucking got out of jail and went into the navy because I caught another case. They offer me military. Here we go. Is them right? They're fucking amazing dude.

Speaker 2:          00:28:30       Will this get us taken off Youtube, you think? Yeah. Sing. And he's a fucking maniac. He does a back flip perfectly on the end of this one song at the movies and lands it perfectly. That's CBS in 82. Wow. I wasn't there. I was their roadie. I was in high school. Yeah. So I was actually living as a Hari Krishna monk at the time in Hawaii. When? When, so how did the Howard Kristen thing? Well, I'm going to tell you. Okay. So what happened was, um, they had, so I talked with her, he said, yeah man, it was really funny because they were all from DC, but they talk with Patois accent. Yeah. Mine jogging arranged mine. We're going to run into, to each other again, you know. So, uh, I beat someone down on my shit pretty bad and I got caught for a drug case in Norfolk, so I knew that they was trying to persecute me and uh, you know, sent me to fucking prison and I was like really not going to have that.

Speaker 2:          00:29:29       So my ship pulled out and we will go into like shell back to South America. And um, I had, this day I was on the, you know, basically under arrest because the fight, it was civilian case for the drugs. I sold to an undercover cop outside of a club called King's head in Norfork on Hampton Boulevard was dead, did punk shows. So I sold him a, you know, Lsd, and he was an undercover cop so I got arrested for that and then that was pending. Meanwhile, I go on my shit, we go out to see this one redneck kept fucking with me and he was like, Fuck Eve, New York faggot. And like, just, I'm like, dude, chill, like you don't know me, like I'm not fucking with you. Just let it go man. And he just wouldn't let it go. So, uh, I trapped them in the paint lock up.

Speaker 2:          00:30:20       I was supposed to meet and I beat him with a fucking paint can in the soft tissues till he shit his pants. Then they arrested me. So they had, uh, they had me on the fucking ships arrest and all this shit and I'm, I got this bad infection. They had to medevac me off the ship, back to Roosevelt roads, Puerto Rico. And they forgot to say that, you know, I'm supposed to be handcuffed to the fucking bed. And then, uh, they cut. They didn't send those orders because this was pre computer. So the paperwork I fucked up, they gave me my id and then they sent me back to Norfolk and then, uh, I was just doing all my shit. And so they just didn't know that you're supposed to be incarcerated. They didn't know that I'm supposed to be awaiting court, poppy, court marshal, whatever the fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:31:10       And then the civilian case too. So then, uh, I was inimitable, which is Tpu, transient personnel union waiting for my ship to come back and they were going to deal with it then. So I was there for like, I dunno, like a month and a half. And, and they were like, Yo, your ship. The dude I was cool with, he warned me. He goes, Yo, your ship is fucking talking today. And I was like, fuck. I was like, I gotta get the Fuck Outta here. So I just packed up a couple of things and I got on the bus that used to go through the base and then roll out Hampton Boulevard. And as I'm fucking day I had already pulled in. And as I'm pulling out the gate in the seat, the fucking master at arms of my ship, the police are right there walking across the street to fucking them.

Speaker 2:          00:31:59       It's all to get me. And I just shrunk, shrunk down in the seat. But if they would've looked up, that was it, I wouldn't be here telling you this story because my life would have taken a much different trajectory. So what happened was I went up and I hitchhiked with his band, the undead from New York. This punk band, bobby bobby still was an original misfits. So they, they played the 9:30 and they gave me a ride back to New York and I get out the van and right there on avenue a one 71 was motherfucking h on the doorway with a recorded and lived. He's like Ross stuff far. I'm like fuck. And what happened was they were playing a show a couple of days later and there's a big Puerto Rican gang that was right there that didn't want them hanging out. So they went in there one night and they, I mean they, they killed people.

Speaker 2:          00:32:52       I'm not going to say the name of the, of the fucking gang because for whatever, you know, I'm not trying to out him like that. But they were, had the largest heroin cocaine spot in America. The feds busted, busted them knock down there building the whole shit. Alphabet city was out of fucking control. So nobody. The beastie boys were there that night. Nobody would fight these dudes back. And I was on a fucking qualia, which is gorilla biscuits. You think you got crazy strength and uh, I said to j Dot Lee, who was the engineer that shit. I was like, Yo, let's get these motherfuckers man. And he's like, dude, they kill people. Don't fuck with them. They will kill you. And I was like, Yo, come on, you fucking do your punk rock is supposed to be fucking tough. Let's fucking get these guys. So they calmed me down.

Speaker 2:          00:33:38       But when I got outside, the dude tried to stab me. So I blocked the knife and I hit him with an elbow and pop out. Bob knocked him down, smashed his head off the curb. Next thing I know, four of his homies come charging at me. Yo, you white motherfucker trying to stab me. And I used to wear a chain belt and you can ask Henry. We all used to wear these chain belts with a quick release, a bike chain to fight people because in dc it would be the marines would fucking or the rednecks would beat up the punk rockers. So I got in a fight with these motherfuckers and I ended up, so I go to run back into one 71 because I lost the chain and one of the beastie boys slams, tries to slam the door. I mean it keeps me out on the street.

Speaker 2:          00:34:18       These motherfuckers want to kill me. I pushed my way in. I got stabbed in the shoulder and then they put out a kol on me. They were like, we're going to kill that motherfucker. Nobody would hang out with me except for this one crazy Russian street fighter kid named James Concert. That's the only dude. So then I said I couldn't go down the alphabet city at all. They were waiting there with fucking guns and bats and like, we're going to kill that dude. But because the bad brains were black, they kind of squashed it over. But I went up there to face him and they surrounded me like fucking dude was like ready to fucking off me and doc and Darryl Docs, the guitar player, the Bass player came running out, Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo chill, chill. And they were like, you know, he was just, you know, standing up like y'all came in, they're trying to stab everybody.

Speaker 2:          00:35:09       You would have done the same shit. And the one dude's name was crazy eddie. And uh, he got, I think he got murdered now, but he did mad time and he just looked at me and it was that moment or this standoff where I didn't know what the fuck he was going to do, but he just goes out to all the white motherfuckers over here. You're the only one with heart. We ain't never gonna fuck with y'all again. Just don't hang out outside the store front because there was gigs at one 71 a. that's where bad play beastie boys. And then the bad brains let me move in. And then they recorded our first album, which MCA for the bad brains. Greatest Hardcore punk album of all time. The Rock has set the lightning bolt. Smith. I was there for the whole recording and uh, then they got me a job and this is where the Christian thing comes in.

Speaker 2:          00:35:58       I always, I always come full circle. But uh, so this punk band named the dots who put out the first bad brains, single Jimmy quit was in a band and he put out a single quote, stay close to me and pay to come and vinny work that this health food store. So they started giving us food and that's when I started changing over to the Diet because bad brains were like, you. Hr would be like, you don't eat the fuckery. You don't eat the Babylon food. You got to eat it. I tell is vitas can be fatal. Took me to the hell it is. I tell it means pure, pure plant based food. No, no oil, no fucking salt. It's like oil. Yeah. Dude. This district, it's like the avocado oil. Coconut oil. No, like if you take coconut and you and you fucking shred it down so fine at the oil comes out of it, that's fine.

Speaker 2:          00:36:49       But they don't do processed oils. That's a different thing when you process the oil. If you have health problems like what they proved in forks over knives, then it becomes a toxic oil to the body and if you have any kind of heart conditions and stuff like that, you should be really avoided. So anyway, what they did was they got me, they were smart because they wanted me to give them free food, the bad brains, and they got me in the health food store and the dude was like, this hippie Yogi dude hooked up with Satchidananda Swami. It was called Pronto foods. And he's like, well, you're going to do Karma Yoga when you first come in here. In other words, you're not going to get any money. You're going gonna, you know you can eat and it's Karma Yoga is good for your Karma. So then I told everybody in the motherfucking neighborhood, I was like, Yo, I'm working at this health food store.

Speaker 2:          00:37:36       Come over and get some food. So bad brains would come and load up groceries. I worked at juice bars given our fuck sandwiches didn't. Entire neighborhood due to sit there watching me and after the end of the day he goes, excuse me, did, did any of those people pay for that food? I go, Nah, man, that's that Karma Yoga Shit you talking to me about. He's like, you're on salary as a tomorrow, do not give away any more food. So then I was like, I worked there for a little while and vinny took me to the Hari Krishna Temple on 55th street. So I kept trying to defeat this dude. Philosophically. I was like, Yo. But, and he knew the whole philosophy of the Vedas and the Bhagavad Gita is where all the yoga or the yoga sutras and all of that comes out of the Bhagavad Gita and prob. I put out the Bhagavad Gita as it is, which, which the original Bhagavad Gita from India.

Speaker 2:          00:38:26       And uh, I kept trying to defeat it all the time. Every day I read Bhagavad gita stream on bog of the time. What do you think? Who Soma? What's does Salma Salma Ross? So morass that is a drink that they drink on the heavenly planets. It's a, it's a beverage on a heavily planets that they get in toxic intoxicated. The big question is like, what's in it? No one knows. There's elements. You know when people say you didn't use lying on the planets. I'm like, what are you fucking Momma Luke? Of course there's life on other. You think you're the only fucking life in the universe. Come on, man. Well, that's one of the things in the Bhagavad Gita is a flying crafts and Soma is one of them. Someone's one of the interesting things rather and Soma, they. It's some sort of a psychedelic concoction, but nobody knows exactly what it is.

Speaker 2:          00:39:15       They think it might be a combination of several things. They think for sure psilocybins in it, but they think it might also be hashish that has. She might be in it. Yeah. I mean there's elements in the, in the upper planetary system that Brahmaloka and all these different planets in the solar. The vedic astrology is much different than the western astrology, so they talk about planets way above earth. You know that, what they're teaching you, the Bhagavad Gita, the. What do they describe Soma, so like what are they called it Soma Ross, and it was a beverage that's drunk in the heavenly planets. It's not available on the earth planet is is the demi gods drink soma, Ross demigods on, on other planets. That's the only time people drink it. She did she bite, smoke the Ganja and stuff like that and I don't know, you know, they put the ashes to the crematorium on their bodies and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          00:40:11       But they, you know, the thing about, there's four principles in the Hari Krishna when you live as a Brahmin monk, which I did, and it's no intoxication at all. No, no eating of meat, fish, eggs, none of that. No gambling and no. We'll listed sex. So I was actually a 100 percent brahma choice celibate monk for how long? For two years. And I trained martial arts in Hawaii and the hills with this one black dude who was fucking fierce and he was a Brahmin Shari too. So we would train and completely celebrate. I was getting up 2:00 every single day in the morning. I was in bed by eight and training and working and just, you know, trying to heal my, uh, my assault. But that came because when I first was going to the temple I wrote, I would write down my questions. I know I'm going to get these motherfuckers tomorrow because I was reading Gorgie, Krishnamurti Rom dots.

Speaker 2:          00:41:07       Like I studied it. I know I saw all those guys. Uh, I went to see a krishnamurthy speak and meditate. I was, I was just eating it up. Like once that light came on a metaphysically for the meditation and the Yoga and everything, I just went full bore into it. So it started from the health food store? Yeah, because store mini signal rally who's now the drummer for the unsane. He still plays drums. He was in the dots. He was in turbo hydromatic. It's a bunch of bands in New York and he just started hitting me with questions. What do you think? This is what he thinks. I was like, I don't know man. And then after giving me this book, He gave me this book called the science of self realization. And I read it and I was like, dude, this Yoga Master Ac Bhaktivedanta Swami Pot.

Speaker 2:          00:41:57       I was like, I got to find out more. Whereas this guy, and he said, oh, he left the planet in [inaudible] 77, but you could go to the temple and see the whole process. I was like, Yo, I want to call. And I went and they had this ceremony and it's called greeting as a dds. And then the song that gets played, George Harrison plays Bass on it and I was like, Yo, it was from the promise some heater. And I was. I just was attracted to it. Everything I've known in my life was pain and violence and just fucking crazy. I mean, you know, so it was a pathway to some sort of an escape from the Pr, the trappings of your past. It was a pathway to enlightenment. It was a pathway to peace. Absolutely piece. But some of the most fierce warriors. And what I loved about Bhagavad Gita is spoken on a battlefield between Christian on Juno.

Speaker 2:          00:42:48       Juno was [inaudible] Krishna's this line, this, this sound pro diet comes from the warrior class. And if you read any books on martial arts, they're going to tell you the martial arts originated in India, the original martial arts school. We're all in India and at one point Sanccob charia chased all the Buddhists out of India and they fled across the Himalayas into China. So this is actual history that you and you can see where the martial arts spread out across across the planet, but you know, a lot of it, uh, a lot of things that are around today originated in India. So to me that really, I was always in, you know, I was a street fighter. I messed around, uh, even, you know, with some going to martial arts schools, always on the outskirts. I even went and trained with Ron van Cleef when he had his school in New York.

Speaker 2:          00:43:43       But yeah, but he would, he would always be trained in police forces. And I was the only white dude in the class and it was all black and Puerto Rican. And when it came time to spot, they beat the shit out of me. I was getting fucking wrecked by the, by the black belts. Byb, uh, you know, I was no lights barnbrook then. No nobody water. There was schools, victim Vega, Ron van Cleef, Ron Tag, and now she does do doc, uh, uh, uh, this other dude named Rodin who ran the school, University of streets, they would run from into the Dojo like 20 dudes and just all out fucking Bra. Like even Brian Callahan, his teacher and all these guys, they train under master Choi and some them joy and he encouraged you to fight. You are training to fight. Like

Speaker 1:          00:44:33       it was very common back then. That was a big part of it because you had to develop people that could actually perform in competition and one of the best ways to do that was deaf challenge matches. So like what you're talking about, smokers, they used to allow that in la up until real recently, over the last 10 years or so, they banned smokers but used to be able to get your experience in actual fights, the smoker and that was a little bit more prepared than the Dojo storming days. But the Dojo stormy days, that's how a lot of people go. Good. And said like, you have real fights, he would go in there, some guy would come from another school and you knew you going to hit each other as hard as you could. It wasn't. It wasn't. It wasn't really sparring.

Speaker 2:          00:45:11       Well, I'll tell you a lot of that spun into gang bonds too because a lot of people that were the martial arts teacher, this one dude jr, he's famous. He was in the New York Times. He was one of the biggest heroin traffickers on the lower east side. He was one of the first guys to get busted onto the rico statute. He did the full 25 and he trained all of the dudes as Sol for him and all his street soldiers were all trained in martial arts. So a lot of these guys were doing shady shit behind the scenes because that's what alphabet city in the lower east side and that's what New York was about. I'm actually good friends with tae mock time mark in the last dragon time. Mocks father is a Christian. His name is cosmo.

Speaker 1:          00:45:54       I met him in La like fucking 20 years ago. He came to a show, I was like, that's the last dragon.

Speaker 2:          00:45:59       Yeah, well, you know, he, I won't say names, but he out is somebody that tried to do some shit to him in and they blackballed him in Hollywood and the guy say, you're never going to make another motherfucking movie, and he hasn't. He got fucking dude.

Speaker 1:          00:46:16       He that happen a whole cogan. Somebody tried to fuck Hulk Hogan. Yeah. Imagine a giant human being. I was like, I'm going to suck your Dick. And he's like, no brother. Real step up to the slim. This is like this Terry Cruz thing or a lot of people made fun of Terry crews because how does this big stud of an athlete, who cares if who grabs your Dick just swat that guy in the head, but he's saying, no, this is a. This is a system systemic problem. When you have people that are in power and they control your destiny and that's where a lot of that they'll ruin you may have. And they did. A lot of people

Speaker 2:          00:46:53       listen like the whole like, you know the whole me too. Shit. First of all, my mother was raped twice, so if some dude is pushing his weight around a on a on a female, I think that Shit's fucked up and then they're going to turn around and fucking fuck these people. I say, fucking get him the fuck added here and I'm going to tell you a story because I'm Julia Phillips and Michael Phillips date. They've fucking produced one of my favorite movies of all time, which was taxi driver and close encounters. They did all those movies. She wrote a book called, you'll never do lunch in this town again. In the eighties. She had the cro mags come and play in a movie at the rich. They flew us off the motorhead tour, picked us up in limos. She wanted to shit to be lip song. I said, now if you want the cro mags is a fucking real show and we're going to fucking lay it down.

Speaker 2:          00:47:47       We had like a thousand of our fans. They will tape do just crazy shit. And two people broke their necks during the shooting. So the movie's called. It's called the beat. Yeah. But the thing was, she was one of the first people to put out an expose these fucking scumbags for doing that shit to people in Hollywood exposed a lot of that in a book that you never do lunch in his town again. And when the book came out she was on the set for interview with a vampire and they came and pulled it off the set and she was fucking blackballed from fucking Hollywood. She never made any more fucking movies. And then even pre internet, this was pre internet and get away with things like that. But she just fucking put up the middle finger to all of them. Like, fuck you. She, she passed away of cancer. But she was like a real fucking punk rock a man she fucking took on the system, the boy's Club in Hollywood. And you know, even the shit, I don't know how legit decore filming, you know, stuff is. I know him and whatever. But like she's saying

Speaker 3:          00:48:50       problem that you don't. Yeah. It's one of those things where I don't know what to do.

Speaker 2:          00:48:53       Yes, there's some shenanigans, but I know that it's something happened. Yeah, I know it, I know it goes on, something happens,

Speaker 3:          00:49:01       not just him. I mean the list is a mile long and for everybody that comes forth is a million people that are sitting back on, I don't want to say anything because I don't want to take that shame on.

Speaker 2:          00:49:10       Well, that's what happened with me. You know, it was the same day like, uh, you know, you have this wrapping, whatever the fuck, but that's all false ego. Even all of that stuff. And then the person that I was with at the time said, you know, this story is going to help a lot of people you by you coming forward and saying what happened to you and how you're dealing with it now. And that's what, that's what I even did. I got this new book, the PMA effect coming out and the whole shit is about healing people and help. I mean, I've helped thousands of people kicked drugs, kick a suicidal thoughts. Uh, and, and you know, it's not that I'm like, I'm turning him into a Vegan. It's like, dude, I'm going to show you the system that worked for me. That's all I can do is tell you, I'm like the fucking mailman, you know, I'm just delivering the fucking mail to you. I didn't come up with it, but I'm showing you the yoga to plant based diet, to meditation, to training, constantly fucking training.

Speaker 3:          00:50:09       Well through all the things you're doing, you're committed and you're, you're disciplined and that's attractive to people, right? People look to for people that are doing things that they wish they were doing, so they see someone. I mean that's the whole cult of personality, right? They see you, they see you, you've got this powerful personality and your positive and you're doing

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       things and people gravitate to that and they want to be a part of that. I mean that's, that's what happens with people, but the first thing that I, and I said it because vice did a whole 18 minutes special on me. If you, if you just google a fucking a Vegan iron man, this shit comes up. They did an 18 minute documentary and one of the things I said, first off, don't say you can't do it. You could do any fucking thing. You apply yourself too, you just haven't tried. You could do what I'm doing and I'm going to tell you I go to racist, these iron mans all over the fucking world and these guys show me pitches. One guy was fucking. He lost 100 fucking pounds. Dude was so depressed. He was on meds for depression, so everything that I'm doing is coming at a service.

Speaker 2:          00:51:13       It's service to help people. It's not. I come at them right from the same fucking platform I'm like, and even the Vedas, what does it say? Not a piece. Han and throw money down an idea Yaka. Danielle said that, hurry. You should think of yourself lower than destroying the street, more tolerant than a tree. Always ready to offer respect to others. In that state of mind, one can constantly chant the holy names of Hari Krishna. So that's the philosophy. So where is the false ego? And thinking, I'm better than you because I eat a motherfucking vegetable and you eat a fucking piece of meat or whatever. It's not about that. It's about trying to help people and have compassion to people and that's something that's really getting lost in this world is compassion. Everybody wants to kick people when they're down and I just don't understand where this fucking sickness came from it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:04       And I think a lot of it has to do with reality TV and this whole microwave, insta fame fucking culture that exists now. It's like what you said, they think that if, if they put down somebody that's going to make, they're going to gain power from it. It's like, it's just crazy. I don't come from that. I come from like, Yo, man, let's help one another to make this world a better place. How are we going to save the oceans? How are we going to save? You know, and you know, my thing is this, look, they just said that the, the fucking commercial meat and dairy industries are now the most toxic. Uh, they're the most toxic of companies on the fucking planet. They just surpassed fossil fuel with the destruction they're doing to the planet. So I'm like, eat a little less news is coming from it just I just, it's, it's, it was just all on.

Speaker 2:          00:52:56       Where did I read it? It was on, uh, one of the main sites like that. So is this by a, from methane gas as a from fossil fuels runoff. Look, here's, here's the thing. So before that Gulf oil spill ever happened, there was a fucking dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, the size of New Jersey. Why all the fucking run off of the [inaudible] and the farms with the fucking toxic pesticides, the fucking, all this shit that these guys are spraying roundup and everything else. And, and the nitrogen that's in the fucking shit when these lagoons that have 100,000 fucking gallons of pig shit, you know, it all was draining into, into the Mississippi and then draining into the Gulf. So if you look at what's going on in North Carolina right now, because I was just there, motherfuckers can't even swim in the rivers anymore. And it's happening in Europe too. They just had to cancel the swim on the Iron Ironman in, in Homburg because of the green allergy and all this shit that's happening now because of all the runoff that's happening with the farms and everything is just we're. We're making this planet of fucking toxic wasteland

Speaker 3:          00:54:07       we've done with farms and it's gotten. We developed cities. We have giant groups of people that are growing anything and then we give people incentive to make as much profit as possible and when they're trying to make as much profit as possible without ethics or morals and consideration are or the impact on the environment. They set off a process in motion that we are many, many decades into right now. So to try to correct it. Now we're just seeing the effects and then on top of that there's all these ag gag laws and that gag laws are devastating because when you see. Like one of the reasons I became a hunter is because I was watching these films of factory farming and I was like, I'm not. I'm not participating in this. I have to figure out what I'm going to do. I'm either going to become a vegetarian or I'm going to become a hunter. I decided to become a hunter and that's how I get my meat, but when you see those videos, those are the videos that expose people to the realities and the horrors of factory farming and those are illegal in most places.

Speaker 2:          00:55:04       Yeah. You go to prison now you go to federal

Speaker 3:          00:55:07       for showing horrible, immoral acts that are done to these animals and the way they're treated and the way they're contained, and we were talking yesterday about this video of a pig farm that there's this, there's this pig farm where these pigs are smashed into this place where they can't move at all. They're all in these cases and then it's. There's a runoff from where they shit and piss and there's a giant lake outside of pig shit and pig pis and no one who lives anywhere near that could avoid that smell. You drive anywhere near that area. It's a horrific toxic smell, so it's already gotten to this almost like incorrect double position like that, that that business is a toxic business, but it's not a regular like a Joel Salitan farm. You know what? That guy has never heard of him. He runs this farm called polyface farms and what he does is he has all these animals live like normal animals, like the pigs, they're not in these cages.

Speaker 3:          00:56:01       He has them roam free and they set. They set up these enormous portable fences, so they take the pigs, they roam in this one area like pigs naturally do, and then they moved the fence to a different area and they transport. They did move the pigs over with it, so the pigs are never contained. The chickens run free and then they go back into the chicken house at night and then they try not to have mono. Like when you have, when you have a thousand acres of soybeans, that shit ain't normal. That's not how plants are supposed to be, and then you have to throw pesticides on them and then when you roll them up, you have to grind everything up. But these gigantic machines and everything gets caught up in their mice and rabbits and everything that might be in the, in the neighborhood while these machines are rolling over.

Speaker 3:          00:56:42       All of that is unnatural and it's not how human beings are supposed to grow food. It's not food is supposed to be. Some of these plants or animals are supposed to be interacting with the environment. But what we're doing with these things is making an incredible amounts of profit. And these people are addicted to this profit. These corporations are addicted. These profit, they have this constant growth mentality where every year, every quarter has to have more. It's a never ending. And they make the laws. And the only way, the other thing, well, they have massive amounts of money. So they bribe politicians and they use all of these, uh, these lobbyists. And what they do is they get these laws passed where it's illegal to film them doing immoral shit. And so then you don't see this, you just go to the store and you buy a cheeseburger, you go to Jack in the box, you go wherever you go, and you buy these things, you get corn, you know where you get corn Syrup in your soda, you don't think twice about what, what has to happen for that corn to become syrup and how much environmental damage has to take place.

Speaker 3:          00:57:44       I mean this is the world we're living in right now is just waking up to what has been in motion for many, many decades. I think what's really important though is that we're honest about health and they were honest about the consequences of our actions in terms of like our purchasing power, what we're doing with food. We got to be honest about all of it. And one of the problems that happens with hunters are carnivores or even vegans or vegetarians, is people only want to look at things that support their position. And with Vegans, there's a lot of people out there that only want to look at things that support Vegan positions in terms of health. And this becomes a real problem because they start, they start using studies that are very shaky, they start adding things to documentaries that aren't necessarily true or proven and it becomes propaganda and it becomes propaganda both ways.

Speaker 3:          00:58:36       I see what this carnivore diet now, there's a lot of people that would this carnivore diet that are like, this is the only way to go, you know, just eat all meat. And I'm like, man, I don't know about all that. I don't see any blood work. I see blood work only I talked to. Um, uh, Sean, what is his last name? Sean? The doctor. Goddammit. Fuck. He's the main carnivore guy. How can I not remember his name? What is, how, how's that slipping? My, my Sean Baker, Sean Being Sean Baker, he released his blood work. It's not good. It's blood. Work's not good. Testosterone's low. There's also all sorts of. And I just want to say, uh, who were the Haas? Let's just look at it this way. Who are the hospitals filled with that are having procedures for bypass? Who were the procedures

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       being done for people? Removing your limbs for diabetes is not the people that it's the people that are eating this toxic diet that Americans to the standard American diet and what people have become accustomed to eating, rolling up, and even these carnival people. Let's just take that for instance, if you do all meet sure your body let that motherfucker might've been on a Dorito Diet. We don't know what the fuck he was eating prior prior to that. So then you put the bodies a perfect machine so it at the beginning of when you're doing all meet, the body's become accustomed to that, but you know the analogy that I use is that's like getting off heroin and getting on Methadone because the methadone, Yo, I kicked dope when I'm on fucking meth now because the method on down the road is going to take even a longer tool and I've seen people that are doing methadone for 20, 30 years and that's why I love the analogy because the long term studies of those diets do not exist right now.

Speaker 2:          01:00:27       No, there's no longterm studies for the current, but if you look at the blue zones around the planet of the people who were the most centurions and the people that live the longest, they have three things in common. Okay. And there's, there's blue zones in Japan, Costa Rica, grease around the United States while the top five, uh, with the most and then, and then California. And it's the adventist seventh day adventists. So the three things that they have most in common with the people that live the longest. Number one, they have a meditation, spiritual practice. They do something every day for pma, positive mental attitude, whatever their higher power is, they do that every day. Number two, they moved their bodies. They're working, they work in the farm, they're exercising. Number three, they eat primarily a plant based diet. They may have a piece of fish in Japan or whatever, or a piece of meat once in awhile, but primarily the seven day adventist study was actually the best one because it was all from different people with different ethnic backgrounds.

Speaker 2:          01:01:33       And the one thing that they had in common, the seven day adventists don't eat meat. And uh, that's my point with the whole thing and you know, when it comes down to diet is I just see what, what worked for me and I try to relay that to people and not not be like my way's the only way and this and that because people, people doing other people are doing other things, uh, in their way. There's raw foodist is all these different people. And the problem is with the false ego in a human being, everybody wants to think that the class is full. Don't try to tell me Shit. I know it all. Here's an issue with centurions, the centurions century. Aaron's centenarians, centenarians, centenarians. Yeah. Um, people that lived to be 100 years

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       is one thing we have to take into consideration. You're talking about people that lived already to be 100 years. So when they were 50 was 50 years ago. All right, we're talking about 1967. Nobody knew shit about diet back then. This is the fact that, okay, so the people that did live that long and they were living this, it's almost a, an accident in some ways are inconsequential. Like what? What is going on today with people's Diet and how long will people live too. There's far more information in terms of nutrition and what you should do and shouldn't do for your body. So what I'm concerned with is like what optimizes people today. I want to see blood work. I want to see like what is going on with your blood lipids, what is going on with your nutrient levels, what is going on with that? And in that case we don't have. We have just a few studies from a few people or if you test from a few people that have done this carnivore diet, we have some people that have done the Vegan diet and have had real hard problems with that.

Speaker 2:          01:03:15       Yeah, but let's just. Let me just say one thing, because to throw the word Vegan on something that does not make it a healthy diet. I know Reagan's data fucking 100 pounds overweight. They eat nothing but fried chicken pizza. You say in organic whole food, plant based Diet. That's what I roll with, right? I don't. I don't fucking say I took a Vegan diet can mean anything, but when you say whole food foods in their original source, organic, no pesticides, whole food, plant based Diet. That's what I roll with, so that's why I don't go around. Nutrient dense mineral dense and the minerals mineral dense

Speaker 3:          01:03:49       with people that live a long time. One of the things that you get from a lot of plants, especially like rich green leafy plants, you get a lot of minerals. Absolutely, and more importantly if these things are raised in an organic environment, you're getting soil that's not depleted and this is a big problem with model.

Speaker 2:          01:04:06       Did you see the article that just came out today that 40 years ago and orange was 10 times more and more nutritious? I think it was. I think it might've been CNN online or something. They posted an article that said the fruits and vegetables from 40 years ago were 10 times more nutritious than the than the way they're being grown today because like you said, rows and rows and rows. That makes sense. How do they extract the nutrients properly from the soil? It's impossible.

Speaker 3:          01:04:39       Well, you know, they have to actually add nutrients to the soil. Most of the time it just adding nitrogen and a few other different minerals, but

Speaker 2:          01:04:47       pig shit. Like what? What they do is to get. How did they get rid of that pig shit. They're spraying it on the fucking crops and you know, well you're. You're supposed to rotate crops in rotation. What you plant next to each other that are extra. I'm not a farmer composting, but I have a friend that is an organic farmer and his name, his name is Keith and he farms up in New Hampshire and he knows all about crop rotation as Keith Leon Forte. If you have to do, you can do it. That's what he does. He has a small farm.

Speaker 3:          01:05:24       The small farms are legit. Like you can have a small farm and be in symbiosis, so like you could be in harmony with the land, but man, you're starting, you're growing, you know, fucking a thousand acres of corn for cattle feed. There's, you might as well be making oil. Well, I mean you're, you're, you're doing something that's kind of crazy, that environment. It's not natural.

Speaker 2:          01:05:46       And, and, and, and listen, you know, I saw a Ted knew Jim play with fucking ACDC and Black Sabbath and 76 at Madison Square Garden. I went to all them shows, but you know, when he came on and the shit that he was talking, I was just like the fucking gmo crops. Okay. Eighty percent of the GMO crop is being fed to animals for fucking slaughter to the, what he called to stupid vegans are not the ones that are eating that shit that most of the crops that are genetically modified, because you have these corporations, Mcdonald's, every one of these corporations, they want every fucking piece of meat. It tastes the same. They want every fucking French fries, potato to be the same. So the only way they can control it is the control of the genetic markers. So that's why they're using all of the, all the majority of the genetically modified grains. And Monsanto, uh, you know, who just got bought out by bear and they're changing the name because Monsanto is such a big rap rap rap. If you don't know it, bear just bought them. Now, do you know the history of bear from surgical company? No, but no. Prior to that they made this cast that went into the Nazi death chambers.

Speaker 3:          01:07:02       Well that's, you know what's funny, that nightclub, cyclops gas was created by Fritz Haber. Fritz harbor is also the guy who created the process of extracting nitrogen from the air. Really? So he's the guy. The reason why we can grow the crops that we have today is because of Fritz harbor. They say that 50 percent of the nitrogen and the nitrogen and most people's DNA comes from the harbor method. He also created cycle on a, on a client, be the Nazis. Well, he created cycle on a and they added this smell to it so that you could smell this toxic gas. You would know it when it was coming so you can get out of the way. The Nazis switched to design B. Fritz Harbor was actually a Jew and they took his invention and cut out the smell portion of it so that they could gas Jews with

Speaker 2:          01:07:48       dark shit. I said, Joseph Smart motherfucker. I'm learning today. It's dark shit, but bob or method

Speaker 3:          01:07:57       saved a lot of people and killed a lot of people. They wanted to try that guy for crimes against humanity while he was winning the Nobel Prize for science at the same time as he was also the first people. He was one of the first people that implemented a gassing program where they used it, the gas, the allied troops in World War One. That was.

Speaker 2:          01:08:15       Wow. That was a big part of that. I didn't. I did not know that. Yeah, it's crazy shit.

Speaker 3:          01:08:19       So that is how we get nitrogen. We get nitrogen from the harbor method when they're poor nitrogen into the plant, into the soil. So they can grow plants. That's a big part of it. When you say genetically modified to the, a big part of that is like we want to think about, oh like labs and science and all this jazz, but almost everything we eat is genetically modified including all of our grains. Like especially all of our fruits and vegetables. We were saying about tomatoes or orange being different than it was 10 years ago. Fucking everything's different because they want these things to be durable so they could throw them in a bus or a truck rather than travel close to French.

Speaker 2:          01:08:56       Well here's the thing, and I know what they do. They take the DNA of a flounder and injected into tomatoes so it can resist the fraud. How the fuck did they do? I don't fucking know. It's. That's real. So if you eat a tomato, does it have flounder right now? Vegans? If you're eating GMO shit, maybe you're not eating Vegan food. You could be eating a fish. Tomato thing

Speaker 3:          01:09:17       is if you eat plants, plants absorb like you. They've found salmon DNA in some plants because plants absorb this fish thing that people use for fertilizer. Yeah, no. So you're getting some of that animal, but it's a natural cycle that you're getting it through. I mean, animals eat animals, plants eat animals, animals, even eat plants. I mean this is fucking crazy plants in South America. It looks like a, like a vase and these rats, they get attracted this sweet smell around the edges and it's slick and they fall into the hole and the plant closes in and swallows them and eats them. Yeah. Well, well,

Speaker 2:          01:09:55       you know, the other thing is this, you have chemical companies making you food. Their job is not to feed the world, not to keep you healthy. Their job is to sell fucking pesticides. Let's, let's be fucking straight up about it. So yeah, they created. What was the other, across a genetic. There's a, there's a, uh, a vegetable, I think it was brought up. Was it cauliflower? Broccoli? They mixed two things and came out with a. it's a different process. What they're doing now and really what they do when they can take roundup and pesticides and put it in the fucking seed, right, is what they're doing now. And

Speaker 3:          01:10:37       so the plant from the growth cycle is resistant to these brands

Speaker 2:          01:10:41       and, and all the people that have in the gut issues. I don't know if you listen, you know, I know you had rich roll on twice. He's my boy. He's a homie dude. He's fucking. Everyone asked me like what's time motherfucker life and what's he like in real life. I'm like, that's the most genuine fucking dude, you know, you ever have anything going on? He just wrote the forward to my new book, the PMA effect. I mean, he's such a fucking. He's a solid cat. Very solid. But um, where was I going with that? You took me down to plans. Glyphosate. Yeah. So he just had Dr Zach Bush. Come on. Who's a doctor? This is clinical research. This is not speculation. This is not fucking Vegan propaganda. This is fucking science. And he proved that glyphosate. And what's happening now with the gut health, gut health is such a huge issue. Everything, the bad fucking disease, it starts in the gut and the glyphosate is eating through the stomach wall and causing leaky gut and all these other physical diseases from happening. Now, the other thing is you have to realize what these pesticides are. They're neurotoxins and then the ones that they're putting inside the seed. When the bug eats the leaf, it fucking dies. So you're eating these fruits and vegetables that are completely fucking toxic.

Speaker 1:          01:11:58       Well, here's what happens. When they created it, one of the things, one of the reasons why they were able to implement it, they said it doesn't kill people. It kills plants and it kills bacteria. So everybody's like, oh, fine. Yeah, no problem. It only kills plants and bacteria that's totally safe. Know your body is filled with bacteria or your good bacteria, the gut as more eco live than there's ever been a human being on the planet ever. There's more cola in your staff and any humans that have ever lived more numbers and you need them and need to. The bacterial flora gets destroyed by glyphosate gets destroyed by.

Speaker 2:          01:12:30       That's uh, that's, that's. I mean that podcast that he did that episode with Dr Zach Bush is fucking. It's fucking unbelievable and I'm surprised like, you know, motherfuckers didn't try to take tattooed out at this point.

Speaker 1:          01:12:46       Well, it's, they're making so much money and people aren't listening and there's so much signal. There's so many noises and they use the word that everyone loves to use. The two words. Conspiracy theories. Yeah. That's a good one. But here's the thing. Once you can prove something in this data and evidence to back it up, it's no longer a theory. It's a fucking fact. So there's been a conspiracy. It's just it. And by the way, when they implemented it, they probably did think that they could get away with it. They think it would have been fine. They really probably didn't know as much as we know today about gut biome. That's all new shit. That's all within the last couple of decades was already tree. Yeah. Kimchi is fucking amazing. I drink a lot of water. Yeah. I drink a lot of Kombucha. Eat a lot of Kimchi. That's where I get it from primarily. Yeah. Good. That's good stuff. Yeah, I mean gut biome is gigantic, you know, to the point where people make memes joking around about me saying gut biome because I say it so much

Speaker 2:          01:13:43       and, and you know, the other reason that I was, I didn't know where this whole conversation would go because I have respect for you as a martial artist. Like I said, I know Brian since the eighties and you know, he always talked about you, but rich roll wrote you and said that I was up at his house and heard that I was coming on the podcast and you responded to him in a text message and said, yeah, it's so fucking toxic. What's going on? Like, I just want to sit down.

Speaker 3:          01:14:11       Yeah. It's another form of identity politics, you know, and people, look, there's a lot of people that I'm friends with that have all sorts of dis. Uh, they agree with things that I don't agree with. They have ideas that I don't agree with. I mean, you're allowed to have varying opinions. That's what human beings, we're all about. We're supposed to be able to communicate our ideas, but you're not my enemy. If you eat plants, that's crazy. Right? And the problem is I eat plants too. I eat a shitload of them. Like this idea that you know, that vegans and mediators are supposed to be enemies.

Speaker 2:          01:14:39       I mean, I had a strange man. I'm going to tell you straight up, I hang out with dudes. Dad fucking eat McDonald's. Like I have friends. Like I don't look like I said I'm not the fly looking for the shit, you know, I try to look to the positivity of every human being and some of them eat meat. My brother fucking my, my brother eats meat. I'm supposed to hate my brother because my brother eats, eats fucking meat, you know it, it's, it's just like, it's like you said, it's identity politics and I don't roll with that because if in my line of work and what I'm doing, which is getting people out of some really dark fucking shit in their lives, like this documentary I'm doing now called 30 to life to shit that these fucking inmates have been through. And the, you know, I'm, I met one guy, he did 50 fucking years man.

Speaker 2:          01:15:30       And he's 90 years old and his story is, he's in amity foundation and it's out now. He's in this. He just got paroled after 50 years, 90 years ago in my fucking phone. And listen to his story before you judge a motherfucker cause they got locked up. He served in World War II in the army. He served in Korea, in the army. He had his friends fucking blown up in front of him. Fucking do. He's seen shit we can't even imagine in two wars, Korea. You know what? Then motherfuckers went through over there with the cold and fucking, I couldn't even bury the bodies brode it had the fucking stack them with just insane. And, and he came back and went onto the streets with ptsd. They didn't even know what the fuck ptsd was back then when he was going through it and some shit happened, which I did not. He got double life. So obviously something really bad happened and I don't know the circumstances, but he's 90 fucking years old right now. And he survived the, the riots and folsom. He survived insane fucking shit. And I'm like Yo. And he's out now, he's out now. He's nine. There's a fucking picture of him.

Speaker 3:          01:16:44       A picture of what is it, what is it like when, when you're out after fucking 50 years.

Speaker 2:          01:16:50       And he's the most humble, genuine fucking dude. All of these guys like I just got what we're training to do. A five k enrich role is leading the run. And uh, and I just got Nike to fucking give them all a air pegasus, new fucking sneakers skies every fucking tears. They're like, nobody gave a fuck when we first went in there and met these brothers, one of the, one of the biggest Tuv this scariest motherfuckers broke down in fucking tears. And was I gail? Nobody gave a fuck about me man. The fact that you guys are coming in here and doing this for us, you don't, you don't know how much this means to me. And I mean he had to leave the room. He was crying. He, I'm going to show you the picture of this cat it. Yeah. I mean, that's why I do here. This is him right here. Read that text. Wow. Look at them there. Man. That's crazy and he's trying to hit on all the female camera girls like he's a fucking Papi Chulo I nicknamed or I lost it. Sorry. Just disappeared on me. Yeah, right here.

Speaker 2:          01:17:57       Wow. Yeah. He served in both was honorably a ptsd and I think, you know, he said people fuck with him on the streets. So what is he, what is he doing with his life now? He's in this program. So they get parole to this program called Amity Foundation and they serve out their sentence and try to reintegrate them. So what I did was when I pitched it and it's kept who did what to health and in cowspiracy and whatever, and I, I hooked up with Paul de gelder. I don't know if you know him. He's the Australian navy seal guy. Lost his arm and leg to the bull shark. Oh, we were talking about him yesterday that mother had carbon fiber is dude. He's one of the baddest motherfucking, most positive people you'll ever meet. His fucking stories. Insane. I just read crazy easy seeing him walk around with that fake arm if they can, like it's totally normal.

Speaker 2:          01:18:53       Gave me a fucking, like I was sitting in the chair and he came up and was like, I heard like the hand and I'm like, no, fucking. He almost ripped my fucking shoulder. Our hand strong dude is fucking. He's like, hey, areas. Wow. You know, I had to be really careful because, you know, I used to take care of my business with the right hand and then like, that's so crazy man. Yeah, dude, hit a bull shark, took his arm and leg and now he's on the discovery channel shark week and he fights for ocean conservation because if you kill the lead Predator in the oceans and the calling that's going on. So I, I, I contacted him and I go, Paul, I'm going to tell you right now the whole Vegan shit is becoming this shit for rich fucking people. And the people that really need it are the ones they can't afford. Twenty $5 to go to a vege fest and all this shit. It's becoming this pompous fucking shit and the food and you go to try to have a fucking meal and it's like fucking 50 bucks. And just in fucking appetizers and the people that really needed a not getting access to this. And I saw 13th, the documentary about the prison industrial complex in America, you know, you see that. So you know what's going on. And I was, it's prison is basically

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       slave

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       slavery. It did, is it, there's a loophole in the law that if you're incarcerated and do a crime that you can be put to work and not get paid. If you get a dollar they're in. They're making Victoria secret fucking underwear and all this other shit. It's fucking crazy. So it really fucking lit a fire under my ass. And I said, Paul, I said all this. A lot of these documentaries are like, you know, I eat Vegan and I got big muscles and fucking whatever the fuck. I'm like, what about the motherfuckers that really needed? What did I go through? I've been to fucking hell as a kid. I was on the streets in New York. I went to. I was in the same place. Mike Tyson was profit in the bronx. Only white dude in the whole fucking place. Fucking went upstate. Did all this shit.

Speaker 2:          01:20:50       I'm like, what changed me, man? It was this process. I said, the people that need this shit, they're not getting access to it. I said, let's come up with something and fucking help these people. Let's go fucking help these dudes who were coming out of prison. And then we contacted kip. He's like, I want to direct it to me and me and Paul wrote up the whole treatment and uh, and then they contacted. We were going to try to put him in an Arabic. These dudes in a house. And then we found that the producer found Elizabeth, who's the producer, African-american Chick. These girls are fucking their money man. They're fucking great. Dawn. And they found this place called Amany Foundation. And they're like, they're already doing this. They, they have him in here. They're doing meditation drum circles, American Indian chance.

Speaker 3:          01:21:40       When you were young and your life is filled, the turmoil and chaos, you found the hard as you found this discipline and becoming a monk and stick into this plant base training guy, but you had a be. It became your ideology became your life. If we came like a path and this will, a lot of people need, they need a path. It gives them a feeling of purpose. It gives them an identity and an

Speaker 2:          01:22:05       and to made to feel like they matter and that's what these motherfuckers that they don't matter and they even punish you after you do your time. That's why they're trying to do. They're trying to sign this legislature. That's a do away with the box. I don't know if you heard about that in California, you have to check off a box that you've been convicted of a crime, so they're trying to do away with that because you did your time, you served your fucking, you served your time, you, you know, you served your debt to society. Why should you continue to be fucking punished and they can't even get a job working anywhere because no one will fucking hire them. So it's a whole. So what we're doing is I have Dante Ross coming in. He's, you know, ben in the hip hop game forever. One of the dudes wants to be a rapper.

Speaker 2:          01:22:56       Another dude wants to play guitar. I just hooked up with Yamaha. They're going to give them good a guitar amp. All these shit. Tal Ronen who owns crossroads restaurant, which I heard you talking about, you. I listened to your park hdl. You talking about, you were talking about, uh, that's Travis Barker is he's an investor. Yeah. So Travis. But Tal Ronen is the chef that runs it. It's supposed to be amazing dude. Fucking towel said. Tell him to come in fucking have a fucking dinner. They do fucking everything man. Crazy food. He's like, he's Oprah's chef dude. And he cooked for the Dalai Lama. He's like looking kind of thick. Yeah. I don't know what she be plant based or whatever. The player base some of the time, snickers bar son. Oh, who knows? Who knows? But it was about giving these guys facility to change their lives. And that's what this documentary 30 life it is because like, well they told me, go out on this 12 for 30 days, you're going to change your motherfucking life.

Speaker 2:          01:23:59       And that's what I did. And I stuck with it. And you know, the training and in everything that I do for Ironman and you know, just I'm on my fucking 11th ironman. Uh, I'm on the road constantly with the CRO mags touring A. I'm in the gym every day. I'm not trying to be a fucking, you know, 90 pound fucking iron man, dude. I still hit the weights, hit the bags, do whatever. I'm all about recovery now. Uh, my friend Aaron J, a drug, a drug, a zoo ski runs recovery in New York City. So I'm all about the see Vac pod and the new calm, which provides a, in 30 minutes you get three hours of restorative sleep. His whole shit, dude. It's fucking amazing, man. I went up there. I'm like, it's fucking Guinea pig. Like all the shit that he's learning, massage school, fucking trigger point therapy, everything that he's been learning.

Speaker 2:          01:24:52       And he's a bad motherfucker. He fought in the golden gloves. He has black belts. He's a hardcore dude all tatted up and you know, I just been on this and I went into crunch because they were offering a special thing and he was, he, he, he led the boxing and he taught kickboxing and worked with all the five points. Guys would all be in, you know, five points more Thai. So yeah, before that, uh, they were all up in crunch, uh, you know, training and then they opened up the school, but he was there and I said, Yo, I want to do this ironman. He started training me from day one to do my first race. I started with him and in 2010 I did my first race, 2012 New York, New York iron man. So then his whole journey, now they open up this place recoveries right up the block from Hansel Gracie's on, on 30th street. So they have to see Vac pod which takes you to elevation and increases your vo two Max by like five point eight percent. And I think doping doing the EPO and everything only gives you three percent. And then he does the Neukom. So now I tried to test the shit and I'm like, alright, Neukom it fucking works with the wiring in your brain. So you put this, these fucking,

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       you put blinders on and you sit there with these fucking headphones and he has electrodes. He puts this gel by the way. I have his card and he said, you come to New York next time for lunch, right? Yeah. So the thing was I tried to fight it and be like, no, I'm fucking not going to pay. I'm not going to go out. And the vibrations that they designed that, the sound vibration that's coming through these headphones, like I'm, I'm just trying to fight passing out. And I just fucking went out and then they woke me up and they're like, Yo, how long do you think you were out? I said, 15 minutes. They were like, you out for an hour and 20. I'm like, what? And it's just, it's fucking bizarre. Like they're learning so much about recovery. And now all this, uh, all kinds of pro athletes are coming into recovery in New York.

Speaker 4:          01:26:56       Uh, the, the studio over there on 30th street all handles guys handles a nephew who just won. What did he just, what was that? A MMA tournament. He just won something. Fuck it. He had some fight and he won in. A lot of those guys are coming in and a lot of pro athletes, there's a lot of endurance athletes that's a go at that are going in. How does it work? Then? There's electrodes that are on, he puts like, do you have a tens machine, you know, a day. The gluey fucking pads, right? So it's the squares and then he puts this gel and he puts it behind productive gel and he puts it behind your ear here. And then the headphones and the blinders. But it's sending a pulse into your body and the sound vibrations at attached to a big machine. It's a, it's a fucking little machine like this.

Speaker 4:          01:27:46       So it's something that we could have here. You can, yeah, you can have it. I'm telling you, man, you will bug the fuck out. That sounds crazy. Like he's an expert in it. Like the guy who manages the whole shit. He's an expert in the new comp stuff, so, so like, you know, he's a big fan of yours by the way too. He got out to Aaron. So this is it right here. Oh, so when you put this on, is it on a timer like it's over when it's over? No, they had to wake me up, man. That's a those pads. They woke me to fuck up. I thought I was out for like 15 minutes. Step two microcurrent stimulation. Step two for newcomb is to. Is to use a sub sensory microcurrent to catalyze the effectiveness of the new comp supplementation. So you take pills with it to know I didn't take any pills. I just. The combination of the supplementation, the micro current works on the midbrain to interrupt the body's natural sleep stress. Natural stress response. Research shows this microcurrent helps balance the brain's neurochemistry by reestablishing optimal neurotransmitter levels. You won't feel it in Swahili as far as that should help. The way your brain works. It's, it's insane dude. And and they're the only, like the only ones in New York that are doing a new calm. They're the only ones

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       in the east coast that have a fucking evac pod. One of the universities out here, they've got one in Orange County. Ian Mccall was using that shift for awhile. He said great, but the woman who holds the world record time trial, I believe she was doing see vac the pod. It's fucking insane. You go in this thing and it's like, uh, you, you go, you have to work up because you can't just go to level five and, and you, you, you fucking shit. We'll just bug the fuck out. So I worked all the way up to level five. But how long did it take you to work up to? It took me like a couple of weeks, you know, but like what I really noticed was with my running because I mark my threshold and everything, so every run when I was training for the last race, I just, I just did Chattanooga a half ironman.

Speaker 2:          01:29:54       So every run I was doing it's going in the back and then go in and do the new calm. And then I do the normatec boots. Like they have everything at this place recover, so like they're just using and then they have this other fucking magnetic blanket that fucking you, you sit on it and then his isolation pad on top and it sends these frequencies through your body. Oh, I've done that wasn't mean, what does that call fucking I'm spacing on the cryo place and they're getting, they got cryo coming down and, and, and it just flushed like I've noticed that I can go fucking hardest. I mean I would have to bike 120 miles and do a brick and get off the bike and go run 13 miles and I'm like fucking breaking threshold fucking records because I started taking up any athlete who's serious about even handles, I think it was his nephew is something that just had that fight.

Speaker 2:          01:30:54       The coach was like, you know, what the fuck are you doing? And he's coming into the evac twice, three times a day. And he's like, dude, he's, he, he his gas tank. He just doesn't run out. And he's just, he's fucking grappling. He's doing everything and he's never fucking tired. He's, I've never seen him perform at this level. So the success is there. Even this woman, she broke the world record, I think it was for tt time trial or track or road or something. This woman's cycle is, did see vac and she and they accused her of fucking doping. That's at the banner. Yammer. Physical fucking legit. They have that there too. It does something. It does something because, uh, I've been, you know, you're always getting hurt, you know that too. I'm always dealing with a fucking nagging fucking injury. You got something now like a growing issue?

Speaker 2:          01:31:45       Yeah. So, uh, you know, um, the, I've never had a race. I, I've got my, I got my nose broken Cabo ironman. I'm swimming out in shark infested waters. Fucking leaking. But even from boxing I knew, don't blow your nose because your eyes are going to swell shut. So I had to do all mouth. We, I've, my first ironman I ever did was New York City and a chromosome. The drama mackey book, the fucking show. This is hardcore, uh, the night before. So we play to like 3000 motherfuckers going off. You know that whole mosh and shit and we fucking lay it down and I fucking had my brother come down. He drove me back to New York City. I had a stress fracture in my foot. I took a shower and I went to the swim start and I did an ironman in August twelfth, 2012 in fucking 95 degrees, New York city humidity.

Speaker 2:          01:32:37       But I was not going to be an extra in your foot. Stress fracture in my fucking foot. And the thing is right where the cleat is. That's where it pressed. That's where my stress fracture, the second metatarsal. And it was just. And I didn't take aspirin. I didn't take nothing. I'm just like, you know, videos like David Goggins volcano, that fucking maniac. I'm like, fuck my pain, you know, it took me 13 hours. And how long did it take you to get over the stress? It took months. It took months. And that's why I started wearing hocus. Now I run with Hoka, Hoka Hoka these shoes and there's other big patents. So that's like a two inch pad. What is the day your shoe goes down in there? It's not actually, but it's this scientifically designed foam that absorbs shock from the, from the road. So, um, a lot of the top heather Jackson runs in him.

Speaker 2:          01:33:37       She just fucking has been winning like crazy. She was just so fucking better Christian, a better cushion and when you get, you know, I'm 56 so it's like I'm not a fucking dude that's recovering so quick as I used to in my twenties or whatever. So I might fuck with barefoot running shoes. I can't, man. It's, there's no, there's no cushioning. I just can't do it. But you're running. Do you do a lot of your run on some may need some time in New York. I live in New York City. I might run the trail, uh, the bridle trail in central park if I can or run around the reservoir. But mostly my shit is all in the city and the hope is just fucking like, you know, I'll be the next day. People say to me, Yo, you must be fucked up for a week after the race. I was like, I did Conan world championships two years in a row and the first year I did it 2016, I fucking went snorkeling with my girl the next day for like three hours.

Speaker 2:          01:34:34       So like the inflammation's not there. I'm getting really dialed in on the equipment aspect, getting fitted for the bike, getting the right shoes to run in it. It literally took me six years to get dialed in on, on even the nutrition aspect and doing them racist because you don't want to get a belly full of fucking gels and all this other shit, you know, so anyway, but the recovery aspect of, of what I do, like I just watched, um, coggins was on the rich roll podcast and he was talking about how much yoga and stretching that he's doing now. Two, three, four hours of fucking street. And I know you're into yoga lover. Yeah, it's fucking great. And that's what I need to start getting back into my girl. Erica is always pushing me. She's like fucking bought me, uh, a, a kiosk thing for fucking integral yoga. And she bought that shift for me last year. I still, you know, it's, it's what you resist. Like if you read, have you read the war of art by Steven? I fucking love it. You have in mind,

Speaker 3:          01:35:47       I bought a stack of his books. I used to give them out to my guests don't take things that are

Speaker 2:          01:35:53       the war of art, do the work. But he talked about resistance and the main thing about resistance is usually we're the most resistant to things we need the most. Yes. Yeah. You know, and it's this deep shit. That book I was grateful every morning I sit down to write my screenplay or my next book, I read his shit, you know, because it's just. And the four agreements, I'm big into two. I went to actually somebody got me tickets to see a Miguel speak, Don Miguel, and it was a life changing encounter for me. The four agreements, don't take things personal, always do your best, be impeccable with your word and don't make assumptions. Which I always thought I've created wars in my fucking mind. And then they're like, dude, I wasn't even taking that. What the fuck is your problem? That's classic fucking Dude, that shit is fucking crazy man. And I think if everybody just slowed down and read some literature on some of these teachers that humanity could do so, so much

Speaker 3:          01:36:55       better. I agree. Pressfield's great man, and what he does say about resistance is so, so powerful because there there is something that keeps you from doing things that you know you're supposed to do and when you do them, you feel so much better. It's like, why didn't I just do it? Why did it? What was all this procrastination and bullshit that was involved in me? Like putting this off and then when you finally do, every time I walk out of a yoga class, I'm like, I gotta do that again tomorrow. I got to keep this ball rolling. This is a part of my life. I got to go. Especially for a guy like you because everything is tight, Nino's racing and running and everything, and then when you're on stage, everything is crushed, crushed, crushed, crushed, destroyed. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's like the thing about yoga is that static, these poses and stretches and your core gets activated and everything gets lengthened. It's just smart way to make it.

Speaker 2:          01:37:46       Well, you know what it is. I try to justify it by going, well, I do yoga at the gym when you know, because I'll do my trigger point and then I do all my trigger point, myofascial release, all that, and then last 15 minutes my girls like that shit don't count. Then it's better than nothing. You need to. No, but I remember how I used to feel when I would come out of those yoga classes in 81 and I, I would feel like I could jump over a fucking building and I need need. I need to get back to that. But even in the resistance aspect, what not doing what you resistant and it could be something like, oh, I made an agreement with myself to fucking straighten out the papers on my desk and go to all this shit and if I don't do it, it puts me in the worst fucking mood. Sure. Because that's what resistance. When you cave in and you give into resistance, man, it's like you and it could be the smallest little little thing like you know, anything. Yeah. And it just, it just irks the fuck out of you. I'm like, Yo. So I try to.

Speaker 3:          01:38:46       That's a good philosophy to live by and you know, to have something that's been fucking with you. Some things you're putting off, whether it's getting back into yoga or cleaning up your daughter to quitting smoking or whatever it is. Having that thing over your head where you know, you haven't taken care of, it makes you think less of yourself and make yourself less.

Speaker 2:          01:39:03       Yeah. And, and that's one of the things I tell these, everybody I work with because I mean literally today and I'm not bullshitting on unsure, I don't try to be like, you know, I don't even say I'm some kind of teacher. Whatever. I just pass the info to these motherfuckers. I today I had fucking four people come up to me on the street. Yo, I heard you on rich. Well fucking so you want to love what you doing man? You fucking help me. I got into triathlon now, I quit fucking drugs. This guy told me that today, and he's like, Yo, I quit drugs. I fucking stopped drinking that. That's what it's all about. That is what am I going to give a fuck them be like zone in on something and find fault with what the fuck he's doing. I was like, Yo man, props to you dude.

Speaker 2:          01:39:45       Fucking, you know, you could do anything you know, you apply yourself to. And nance really, you know, um, my whole thing in life is to just, you know, and that's what part did proper. Came to America in his seventies of border geology to cross two oceans, had two heart attacks almost passed away. But his teacher in India said to go to America at 70 years old with $7 in a case of bog of toms. And he came to America to the lower east side to the bowery. What's a burger with Tom? The Bagua. Tom Srimad. Bhagavatam is what's known as the spotless Parana. It's a, the bog of a time she went back to the time is an ancient literature in India. It's called. It's part of the Puranas is called the spotless Paranas, so there's 10 days of the book, 10 candles he didn't even have.

Speaker 2:          01:40:33       He brought the original texts that have been passed down from one teacher to the next to the next, to the next in India, and they said his teacher Bhaktisiddhanta said, you need to write these books in English for the world to help the world, so he didn't owe the people in India with like Swamiji, you know you are. You're at the end of your life. Why are you going to go to America? It's a very dangerous place, not only to go to America. He went to fucking New York to the bowery. They robbed him. He slept on the floor. He Fed people. He cooked me. Alan Ginsburg Academy's first storefront over there called matches gifts, and they saw the humility of this person probably pod and what he did for people. How he has so much love. He would cook the meals, serve everybody clean up before you would even eat a grain and rice. He had no possessions, none.

Speaker 2:          01:41:22       He slept on the floor on a mat and they saw the humility of him and he just. And when I learned this story, there's a great documentary on him called you're ever well wisher on youtube and it's about his life and how he came and you know, uh, Charya means one who leads by example. It's not what, and I've learned this just by these big mounds that are out there that talked so much shit. It ain't, what the fuck you say, it's what you do. It's about your action and your words and how you interact with other people and how you see other people, even these fucking so-called celebrities is when the camera's ain't on. How do you treat people, you know, what the fuck is the real core of your existence? What are you here to do? And when I saw a proud part and, and, and, um, you know, read all this stuff on him and then started taking up the process, I was like, you know, um, it just changed, changed my life so that you know, for the better so

Speaker 3:          01:42:21       well by you saying that. And it was very enticing for people, right? Like the guy I want to do what he's doing, I wanna I want to feel better, like he's feeling better. That's what's amazing about having someone who's a great role model, meaning like me. You might not even think of yourself as a role model, but by living your life by example, by doing things that you should do, but being healthy by being active and enthusiastic, but you've got passionate about what you're doing about your music, about pushing yourself, about your books, about the exercise. And when you do that, people that don't have purpose in their life, they see that and they go, that's what I'm missing. I'm missing because we're missing so many things in this life. But one of the things that people are missing is role models. They're missing someone who they can look up to and go, oh, I. This is the way to do it. And it. And when you emulate their lifestyle and start thinking the way they think and using their lessons and applying them to your own life, you start seeing benefits and then that passes down to other people who see you.

Speaker 2:          01:43:19       It's like a candle. One candle can light up. Like hr was that for me, like her could have been telling me to worship fucking cheetos and and I would have done it. Thankfully he was into the right shit. But I would see him go on stage and I would see his humility. He wouldn't. He would always say, John is the ability of anything that I have. He would always give praises to the most high to John. Rastafari humble is fucking hell. And the best musicians to ever. Those four motherfuckers are praise by every single fucking musician today. If you talk Doc Daryl, earl and Gary doctor know every motherfucker musician out there, it will be like, those dudes are fucking Don's because they study music. They were into jazz and they were into fucking return to forever. And John Mclaughlin, Mahavishnu dark in 81 was like, they call me squids because they met me in an Aeo squids.

Speaker 2:          01:44:15       I'm going to take it to the palladium return to forever because they met me in the navy. Oh, squid, squid. Squid. That's hilarious. Yeah. And then, uh, and then they call me Johnny Joe. So that's where the John Joseph, I didn't use my last name. [inaudible]. I was fucking a future there for 15 years. Oh, that's funny. Yeah. So, uh, the, the thing was, he's returned to forever as al Di Meola, Lenny White Stanley Clarke. And I'm missing chickarina fucking do you ever listen to this shit? So you want to go down a motherfucking know, listened to return to forever romantic word. You want to go down a rabbit hole with how fucking amazing these fucking musicians are, or weather report or any of these, you know, Maha Vishnu, birds of fire. Like they started turning me and he would say, squids, this is how we learn to play with the fuck we play.

Speaker 2:          01:45:09       And nobody could touch the bad brains musically. Energy on stage. Nothing. And I would see these dudes. I'd be like, what the fuck are you into? And then the role models that, like you said it, you know, we need good role models. There's, you know, there's so many fucked up people that these kids want to emulate today. You know, and I see it because I came up in New York, I worked in all the underground hip hop clubs. I work for the Pope or pot. I used to deliver pot to all the rap stars. I delivered pot pot. My friend, uh, the student Matt worked for Tristar. You like, Yo meet me at the Boston Comedy Club. There's this black comedian there and he's gonna be fucking huge. And I would show up on my bike and you know who you know, who the fuck it was? Dave Chappelle, Chappelle, they fucking Chappelle.

Speaker 2:          01:45:57       And when he did half baked, did you notice that he put the weed delivery guy in all bike here? Where the fuck he think he got that phone? I used to show up. I never carried a bag. I showed up with a $4,000 carbon fiber carbon fiber frame and I had a black water bottle. And all the weed bags was in the two water bottles. So it just looked like I was a cyclist out on a motherfucking out on a ride. Oh, Dave Chappelle. Yeah. And then they, uh, Dave Chappelle, we didn't, he, he blew up so fast. Matt Heine was the guy's name. He was the publicist at Tristar pitches and then I delivered to them at the Boston comedy club and within like months he was living in some police show fucking spot on second avenue and 15th in the. And I'm like, Yo, how the fuck did you get from their head?

Speaker 2:          01:46:45       He just, you know. But yeah, it's like, um, you know, just thankfully the dudes show me the right path in life. And uh, I've been, I've been trying to stick with it and pay it forward. That's my whole thing is paying it forward, paying the knowledge forward pain. You go out of my way to fucking help people. I feed the homeless in New York. I sponsor a soup kitchen. I've done benefits that have been on MTV because you know, I grew up being starved, man in the foster home, like this bitch fed us. She would take a oreos and she didn't like to fill in, so she would scrape off the filling and spit it in a bowl and put it on green, moldy bread. That was our meal for the day. So we had to learn to scam as kids. They fed us rotten food. We were never allowed in the house.

Speaker 2:          01:47:32       They beat the shit out of us. They were so cheap. They made us clean their carpets with toilet bowl brushes, new toilet bowl brush, because they didn't want to run the electricity. All seven kids had to take a bath in the same fucking bathtub water, one after the other. So how do we get around that? We went to the fucking gas station and we would fucking bathe, do pocket showers and everything was about survival. It was all survival, survival. Even even on the streets. I was a heroin mule. That's how I survived. I, I left St John's. That's how I got into punk rock. You know, the Ramones, rock, rock, rock, rock away, beach St John's home for boys, rockaway beach, 1976. I'm like, Yo, I'm weird. And I started getting into iggy pop and all that and then, you know, it was, and then I'm seeing the ramones hanging out at 116th street at the circle.

Speaker 2:          01:48:24       And um, and when I split from the boys home, I moved in with these junkies in this bungalow and they're like, Yo, go down the alphabet city, you're gonna, you're gonna. Carry all the heroin back for us. So that was my gig and then he set the guy up and robbed him and all this crazy shit. Then I was making fake acid and go into the garden and it just a fucking street urchin. And then I got into the angel dust, a selling it in forest park at the dome. Frank Grillo. His father knew who, you know, Frank Grillo to actor. Yeah. He's friends with talent. Yeah. Very good friends. Fucking, he's another great human being man. Uh, frank. Uh, I know from crunch I met him at crunch actually, like there was a lot of cool people that were in his father. He goes, Yo, I just read this guy's book, like you hung out.

Speaker 2:          01:49:12       His father was like supposedly homeless and flaws. You remember this kid that used to hang out with disco and oldies and Bobby Byrd and all these guys. And so he's like, Yo, where the fuck did you hear those names? Like is this Guy John, you know, John Joseph v was a fucking kid back then. And, and uh, you know, it was, was on the streets over there and fucking selling, selling dust at the dome. And uh, so just all, you know, all that crazy. Like I've been around all those negative people and try to like, you know, I had people, this one guy, junior nuts and ducky host and they both got murdered, but they will be like, take that pipe and go smash that guy in the fucking face with it. And I would do it because I was 14 years old. I'm on the fucking streets and you know, you try to impress crazy motherfuckers by being crazy and I did a lot of fucked up stupid shit in my life. Then I'm still trying to write a, the karmic scales for. So my work will never be done until the last breath I take in, in his lifetime. I, I'm trying to help trying to help people. And uh, you know what, by whatever methods I can, you know, that's what.

Speaker 3:          01:50:23       Well, that's a beautiful path, man. I mean, you've turned a terrible situation and a terrible, terrible circumstances into a way that you've created now where you're inspiring people all the time. That's very positive. I mean, just the impact that you have. I think one of the things that we were talking about earlier about all the negativity that people have online. I think part of the problem with that is I don't think people totally understand communication. I think what we're handed is these tools to distribute our thoughts and our information and we're trying to get rudimentary reactions and we're not understanding that these reactions don't just stop with the person that we're interacting with. They affect ourselves because they affect how we feel about ourselves. If you write some petty shit about someone you don't respect yourself, you, you. If you write some nasty, snarky, petty shit about someone and you're insulting for no reason, you know you're insulting for no reason and you feel it yourself.

Speaker 3:          01:51:21       You don't have great self respect for yourself for that, and then on top of that, that person that you hurt their feelings, they might perhaps interact with other people negatively because of that as well. Chain reaction they might get. They might become the first to attack next because they'd been attacked before too, so they start acting that way in the for what it is is a lack of understanding that a lot of us have, all of us, I've been guilty of it to have the impact that our, that our communication has because we're not thinking about it in a comprehensive widescale look with thinking about in terms of that is annoying to me, so I'm going to fuck that guy's world up by saying shitty things about him and his fat, stupid face and whatever you want to say about them. And insult them, and

Speaker 2:          01:52:04       I'm going to tell you what a lot of the problem is too. And I see it all the time. We're losing the art of even having a conversation between human beings because this is what everybody does when you see them going down the motherfucking street and Yo New York is still motherfucker's dangerous. And now all these motherfucking texting zombies can come out of the club and they fucking rob. They're getting run over there getting fucking crazy, you know. But the thing is, is like this right now, we have a law. I go out with my friend Jake from rocks off in New York City. He does all the rocks off towards it, does all this stuff. He has a role. When he out to dinner, everyone has to hand them motherfuckers cell phone in to the fucking Maitre d and no cell phones. So that you sit there and talk with each other.

Speaker 2:          01:52:54       You have the conversation and it's, what is it? You know, I saw this whole special and it was um, it was on CNN and it was Anderson Cooper. And um, it was the guy that was teaching mindfulness, I forget he's been teaching meditation. I wrote about him in my book. So the whole rule was they had to be mindful the entire time that they were at this thing. They had that no cell phone, no TV, no nothing. And they had to be mindful when they ate mindful, when they took a shower, mindful when they walked down the street, remaining mindful during conversations, respecting other people and like it was heads of the heads, the CEO of fucking Google and all these big companies were there and what they learned at this retreat for the 10 days or whatever, that they were there a week. It was so powerful that they took that and implemented that in their companies.

Speaker 2:          01:53:49       And now google, they make everybody sit down and in fucking auditorium before they start their day up there in a silicone valley or wherever the fuck they are. And they have to just sit there for 10 minutes and be mindful and meditate and be mindful. And that's something that's becoming a lost part of humanity because it, you know, the, the, the, the Internet and all of this shit. It's like people are losing touch with themselves and with each other. You don't validate me. I don't got to, you know, what I do with them. People when they even knew I was coming on here and they was talking shit I fucking deleted. I didn't even read them off. Uh, comments. Once I saw a few toxic words, I'm like, fuck you, delete block. See a fucking later. To me it's out of sight, out of mind. I just don't have time for people capable of.

Speaker 2:          01:54:43       Yeah. Because you know, I still have the tendency to do the for disagreements. I, I do take things personal. I will make assumptions. I'm, I'm a work in progress. I'm not healed. Just like I say, I'm always going to be an addict. There's always that possibility that I'm going to fucking. I have to have my coat of armor, which I say in my sword of fucking pma and my coat of armor, which is everything I do everyday, but I'm not beyond the shit. I'm China, so you know, why the fuck do I want to go hang out with very negative people or listen, you know, or if somebody starts talking shit about somebody else, you know what I say to them now, Yo my man, did you tell so and so that, why the fuck you telling me I don't want, I don't want to hear it and I forget which philosopher said it, but he goes, the only true a examination of a, like when we find fault in others, it's really what we're seeing in ourselves.

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       We're pointing out the bad shit and ourselves for sure constantly for finding, you know, with other people. And it comes back to that fly mentality, man. I just, you know, and try to set the good example and that's another thing Paul said examples better than precept and right now you just have a motherfucker, a bunch of people talking shit instead of trying to be the example and try to live it and do it. There are a ton of people out there that is crushing it and staying positive and doing, you know, getting off drugs, getting off alcohol, like even the people in this program and you don't even notice shit that these guys have been to. It's fucking insane. Can you imagine spending 20 years in a fucking jail cell or going to Pelican Bay or going at Pelican Bay, being in the shoe, like what the fuck that does to human beings.

Speaker 2:          01:56:38       Like the strength that that takes, and I'm going to tell you, and the other reason I got involved is because my uncle back in the day worked at Chino prison in the seventies and eighties. He was like the assistant warden or something in Chino, Chino, if you know the prison system, what they call it here in California is gladiator school, but there's a documentary about this guy and he's a former navy seal and he went in there and the documentary's called salvage lives and he went in there and taught these guys. He put them through like a little buds. Dang squirted him with holes, trained them. Fucking hot as hell. Taught him every aspect of commercial diving and when they got released he got them jobs on oil rigs and all this stuff, making six figures and the guys who were working for these oil companies, they said these are the most skilled fucking people that we've ever had come to work for these companies.

Speaker 2:          01:57:34       So between trying to be the set a good example and seeing that people before me that's done it and wanting to reach out and help people have seen and my uncle telling me about this guy and then seeing the documentary when it came on, I was just like, I gotta try to do something to turn the tide and having a platform like Netflix or whoever is going to pick up this documentary. It's like, you know, if it could show people listening, stopping costs, aerating motherfuckers. It's about education, not incarceration. These are not animals. These are human beings. It's a broken system. It is. Sure.

Speaker 3:          01:58:09       It's not helping anybody. It's just making people harder. Criminals and it's just punishing them by keeping them locked in a cage and they never get any better. And then the idea is that you're removing the dangerous elements of society and protecting the rest of us. Yeah, I get that. But there's this idea of rehabilitation. It's nonexistent

Speaker 2:          01:58:27       now. They even removed the exercise equipment in the prison because now if you watch 13 years, right? Yeah, they, you know, it's basically like warehousing bodies, man and violate them. One dude got violated for smoking a cigarette in a facility and they sent them back to serve the rest of his fucking sentence. There is crazy. And especially out here in California like California and Texas and Florida, man is fucking crazy. You know. And, and, and look, I look back to the whole situation that went down in the eighties because I really try to do research and the whole thing that went down. You had a nancy fucking Reagan saying, just say no. And you know what George Bush senior was doing the fondos operations in South America. You know about that selling crack. Fuck is selling motherfucking crack. The vice president was bringing the cocaine landed in freeway.

Speaker 2:          01:59:23       Ricky on Holy Shit landing the planes in Arkansas. Right? But Governor Clinton and transporting the cocaine and then decided the Tom Cruise movie. Fuck yeah, I saw it. I loved it. What is it called? Made in America. America made in America. Yeah. And the thing was, and then they passed. They passed these draconian fucking drug laws like, I think you could get caught. I forget what the exact amount of grams. We're of minute portion of crack cocaine. And there was dudes getting busted with quarter pounds of Co fucking coke, but that's white man's. And they would get fucking a slap on the wrist. These dudes will go away for 10 years. So they, they put the cocaine in neighborhoods, they funded all their operations in South America and then they pass draconian drug laws. And this was the Clintons. Hello,

Speaker 1:          02:00:14       Michael. Rupert. Michael. Rupert was exposed all that. Do you remember they had those town hall meetings with the Dea and the CIA and the Michael Rupert who was a, he was a homicide detective for the Los Angeles Police Department.

Speaker 2:          02:00:26       You know what I did? I did, I did. I think

Speaker 1:          02:00:31       it wasn't a homicide. It was homicide. Right. And he, um, he went in front of this big meeting on CNN and explained it to everyone was cspan or CNN, I don't remember, but it was on television and he explained that he busted the CIA selling drugs in the inner city and that he has documents that can prove there's a detailed history of them selling drugs than using those profits overseas.

Speaker 2:          02:00:56       There was a documentary about it that came out and it was these big, uh, the big drug dudes in La said, yeah, these guys would just show up with fucking van loads of fucking cold.

Speaker 1:          02:01:10       Can you ever see that video of him talking in front of those people? See if you find that video because it's fucking crazy eyeopening video. But there's, they're having this town hall meeting. Here it is right here. Oh yeah. I saw drugs throughout this country for

Speaker 5:          02:01:25       fuck him. How been crazy allegations of CIA involvement in

Speaker 2:          02:01:38       it. They, they

Speaker 6:          02:01:40       listened. I obvious way. That is an answer for a lot of you. And now had you played. I refer now. Can you place I to right? Wait, wait, wait,

Speaker 1:          02:02:01       what the fuck? The CIA selling drugs just told everybody that.

Speaker 2:          02:02:06       Do you know that they declassified those papers to fucking those. You can read all of those papers now online that they fucking did that shit. Then they invested in the fucking prisons. So they're making money. That's the crazy thing. Is privatized prisons

Speaker 1:          02:02:23       the most evil thing that you can make money and therefore you're incentivized to make draw the drug laws are more strict so you can get more people in prison. So you generate more income.

Speaker 2:          02:02:32       13th man, if you ain't seen [inaudible] documentary. When I saw that, I knew what my calling was to do because you know Noah Levine, he wrote this book, Dharma punks and he's been a Buddhist. He was a heroin addict. He used to do a Buddhist ministry and the prisons in and change these people's lives and you know, he, he, they came out in his magazine called Satya and I read this article. So Satya in Sanskrit means the motive goodness. So that's what this magazine was called. And I read this article about these inmates daddy was working with and one of them said he was never getting out. He's, you know, life without the possibility. And he said if I had access to the information of what I've learned through this program, I wouldn't be where I'm at. So then that planted the seed in me and then just seeing what the whole shit turned into, how the people that really need the food deserts in everything that's going on in this country and the research I've done and everything I've been talking about and fighting for change by taking action against the fucked up shit. And then 13th coming out and just lit another fire under me. I'm like, man, let's fucking like help these people, man. And, and um, but yeah, the whole I knew about all that coke shit back in the fucking day. And at first I was like, Yo, because congress wouldn't cut a check to him to do his dirty fucking shit down in South America. Good. We got our hands in wars all over this fucking trying to take down governments all over this fucking planet, man. It's insane.

Speaker 1:          02:04:08       Yeah. That barry seal story's fantastic. That's the guy who they the Tom Cruise played in that movie. I mean, it's a fucked up version of it in the movie. I'm sure it's not totally accurate, but that guy was selling drugs and he was going to South America and bringing them over and dropping them off in Arkansas while Clinton was the governor.

Speaker 2:          02:04:24       Any part of them. There's The da do it was like, I fucking got you. Yup. Call comes. Let them go. Guess who it was? Bill Clinton. Yeah. That's fast. That's a fucking fact. That really happened and you get, you know

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       Hillary Clinton, I'm for black people in this and that. No you ain't you. And now she's like, yeah, we have to change the fucking prison laws and the sentencing laws on drugs though. You created those two. Three strikes was your fucking husband.

Speaker 3:          02:04:50       She's a fascinating character because people want to think of her as being this super progressive person because she's a woman and because she's a Democrat, she didn't believe in gay marriage

Speaker 4:          02:05:00       until 2013. Sorry, Shit I got. I got fucking. I saw videos of talking shit against gay marriage and, and like, you know, marriage should be to unity of a man and a woman and guy like it's all political. It's all mouthpieces. They, they changed it. No one can take a stance and say, this is who the fuck I am. The matter what group I'm talking in front of that. So I look to and have respect. I don't change my stance on shit.

Speaker 3:          02:05:27       Well, you remember when Bernie Sanders is trying to get it to release the transcripts of those speeches that she gave in front of the bankers. Come on, tell us what you. Those fucking things buried long gone like, no chance. You're not going to release those. That would be some dark shit where she's making sure that you're going to make more money. You can me an office. I'm going to make sure you keep making money. We're here to make you make more money.

Speaker 4:          02:05:48       I, I've seen, uh, your comments on trump to some pong. What do you think about homeboy

Speaker 3:          02:05:56       this? I think no one should be president. And I think the idea of having a popularity contest fucking ridiculous. It's ridiculous. Well, we should have as a council of wise people and they should have school, the real shit be a group of the most wise a codified yes, but I mean you should. Your. Your work should be judged like it shouldn't be partisan. It shouldn't be. You're trying to appeal to social justice warriors are radical progressives or radical conservatives or right wing Christian fundamentalists. It should be you're making sense because you understand law and fairness and ethics and morals and values and you understand like with an objective sense and an educated sense of how to establish a quality community of human beings, civilization in which people can prosper in which laws are fair and in which we we established what are what, what, what do we find necessary? What do we find important? What's imperative? Education, community, all these different values and enforce those in it somehow or another, figure out a way to make this world a better place than what it is now. Engineer a better place. That's not what we get. What you get is some person who says they're going to do all kinds of shit until they get in there and they very rarely do.

Speaker 4:          02:07:15       Did you see the Ab shit that they just put up for all of fucking trump, like the shitty promise on the campaign and now we're actually doing. It's fun. No one's done any different, but Obama did the same shit. Bama did the same shit. They get. Listen, Hillary would've done the same shit. They all, they all do the same shit. And, and the thing that fucked me up the most is the vote doesn't decide who the fuck gets in tradition. It's fucking the electoral college is. What the fuck is that shit? Who is that? Who the fuck? Wonderful.

Speaker 3:          02:07:45       The government was a great idea when you had to get on a fucking horse and take your ass to Washington in order to place your votes. You don't have to do that anymore. You could vote instantaneously. People should be able to vote on issues with their phone. Okay? Your phone's in your pocket all the time. You should be able to. First of all, you should have some sort of understanding what you're voting on. You should have to pass some sort of test. They should say, look, do you want to vote about, you know, do you want to vote on spending? Do you want to vote on healthcare? How much do you understand about healthcare? Well, let's take a test and the people that can pass the test, understanding what the consequences are, why they're doing this, then you should be able to vote, but this should be something that you should have some skin in the game.

Speaker 3:          02:08:26       There should be some understanding of what the system is. Instead, you know, look, I'm not a giant supporter of any mainstream media, whether it's a right wing or left wing, but there's something fucked up about these people from CNN go to these trump rallies and you got hundreds of people giving them the finger. Fuck you. You're fake news. Fucking they got an American flag tee shirts on. It's. Yeah, there's, there's a, a nonsense almost pro wrestling aspect to all this. What has become it, but he's profiting off this. Trump is. This is for his, his, his advantage. He set this up because he found a broken system and he said, oh, I just fucking rigged the system. I know how to get people to like me. I've been doing this forever. I'm a cocky, arrogant billionaire. That's my shtick. I'm going to walk up there with my $5,000 suit on and I'm going, wow, the shit out of these dummies and I'm going to have cheered for me until these guys are fake news. You sit down, you're fake news, and everybody goes crazy.

Speaker 4:          02:09:24       Yeah. Did you see that somebody just. His video was, I think it was. Might've been seen in and posted and it was like the toxic level of it was his group and they were just yelling at Jim Acosta. Yeah, that was talking about that too. I saw it and they were all like, fuck you fucking screen. I'll tell you something because I'm a. I'm a native New Yorker and I have friends that are in the unions and they built fucking trump. Burned a lot of fucking people and got rid of fucking skilled labor and skilled fucking a union people and burned union people and hired illegals to do the fucking work and his fucking bill. All this shit. This guy says he's, you know, everybody says what they have to say in order to get the votes. And he didn't have a good reputation amongst console. Terrible, terrible. So not for paying his bills to, hey yo. So many lawsuits against in school that he fucking trump university, trump university. If you gave that motherfucker your money, but you know what the doesn't mean that Hillary would have been a good choice. Now. She was a terrible choice. She's

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       a corrupt politician. One of the most unlikable people that's ever run for office. She in so many ways, crazy shit. We're trying to get it. They were trying to get people to be supporting her just because she's a woman. There was a lot of that. It's like, this is going to be your history. You know, women ladies, I stand with her. So there's all these women at this blind, allegiance towards this career politician. It's completely full of shit. She's been full of shit forever. If you watched the conversation between James Komi when James Comey testified about what he did and what they found with the Hillary Clinton emails and then her version of it, she's just a straight liar. She deleted 33,000 emails. Do you do that? And then, and then, uh, even worse than that, when they rig the DNC, they've rigged the primary so that Bernie Sanders was gonna lose.

Speaker 1:          02:11:21       They mean they, she had her people to. The DNC was an advanced that Donna Brazil book about his mind. Yes. The thing was he was packing fucking stadium. She couldn't even fill a fucking highschool gymnasium. She was pulling all the strings and she had all the favors that she was pulling in and she had a shit ton of money behind her and they were completely arrogant and all the liberal elite and the media thought that it was no chance she was going to lose. She's 95 percent shoe in to win the presidency. And she walked around like she was. She thought she won. But you had to Bengazi Shit. What the fuck was up with that? Exactly what the fuck was going on over there? That lie and you know, uh, with the dirt that's on a, I hope, you know, whatever. Bill Clinton, I know you eat vegan sometimes so nobody had a real problem with it.

Speaker 1:          02:12:12       When, when, when, when the hate rotten them out all times he pulled. But like, but like she get away with that. Like what? Like how about shaming all the women that came out and accused him. She would attack those women and go after them and the, you know, they mean bordain talked about that recently before he killed himself. There was a thing about what she had done to attack the women who were victims of bill, especially earlier career. Oh God. She fucking represented trauma Lester. So it was one of the things that she did earlier in her career. She got them off, you know, there's a, there's a videotape that Dave Smith was, she was laughing in one of them about the victims. Like I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with me? She was laughing about the effectiveness of lie detector tests. And like, obviously I don't work.

Speaker 1:          02:13:02       Ha Ha. Yeah. She's a piece of work. She is man. She's a long time lifelong politician and a lawyer. And what's all the shit that went down in Arkansas? The shit that the whole day were all accused of back in the day. What was that? The a whitewater. The Whitewater shit like. And just the string of people that have been fucking whack to Vince. Yo, what is a great book I read a long time ago called the strange death of Vince foster. It's like, wait a minute. What? They found the gun in his hand, which you never do when you kill yourself, when you shoot yourself, when you shoot yourself, he pulled that trigger blam. Everything goes, the gun goes flying. You don't hold onto it is recoiling the gun like you know, and you blow your brains out. You're not holding your gun anymore. It goes flying.

Speaker 1:          02:13:47       And he was. He had the gun in his hand and the blood that was missing from his body was not on the scene of the crime. So the researchers think that they moved his body. He was dead. They put them there and make the crime scene. They put a gun in his hands up, case closed. But what was he testified he was going and fucking, he knew he had information about Whitewater. I mean, what he was going to say and who knows they killed them. We'll never find out. How about the guy that, uh, was one of the whistleblowers for Enron, shot himself in the head twice and he threw that shit sylaria shoot yourself in the head twice. Luck. Case closed. That's clearly a suicide. I mean, I guess you could kind of graze your head if you pussied out like, ah. And he's like, fuck, I'm bleeding.

Speaker 1:          02:14:30       I could do it. It is possible, but it's more likely somebody killed. People kill people. It's part of the thing when you're involved with billion dollar deals with giant corporations and they also tied into the military industrial complex, who by the way, kill innocents all the time and write it off like all this shit that happened with drones. What's the number? It's like in the high eighties or 90 percent innocent people killed by drones. They don't worry about that. You think they're going to worry about some guy's gonna sink, Monsanto, or sink and faucet or sink the Clintons or sync. Anybody? Fuck that. Send the boys whacked out, cleaned it up. Absolutely chops off the head twice. This conference. We're all good. Everything's wonderful. Here's Monsanto with some new glyphosate that's going to fix your corn. You'll never have to fucking pigweeds, but I, I read this thing that most of the, most of the glyphosate that's being put out there is by people on their fucking own homes, like they don't know any better.

Speaker 1:          02:15:31       They spray roundup. It's A. I have a friend who had bone cancer and he lived near a golf course and they put so many pesticides in the golf course that had got into the groundwater. Right? And he said, all these people in his neighborhood got cancer and he wound up. He has a fake femur bone. One of his femur bones, a metal. It's a metal bone. You got bone cancer. They cut his bone out and they replaced it with this metal pipe. Well, my uh, you know, the, the history of them two was agent orange and all this other shit and my uncle was forced recon in the marines and he got fucking like everyone in his unit that got behind fucking enemy lines and airy got Ms. Cancer, fucking the shit. They was spraying that shit on our own fucking troops. Yeah. Well they figured, look this, this is the way we got to get with. The problem is they're hiding in the jungle. We got to get rid of the jungle. It's just killed the jungle with poison, with this crazy thinking. They just sprayed chemicals all over the jungle

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       to kill the fucking forest so they could see where the enemy are hardened. And then they had the troops walking through those chemicals. It's fucking nuts. It is. History will not judge them kindly when they step back and think about what they actually did mean. It's in the 19 sixties were our parents generation and the way we look at it as almost like this unfortunate thing that happened, but I almost think we're too close to it to recognize how horrific it is that the soldiers who were putting their lives on the line in their thought to defend our freedom over in America, we're getting poisoned by their own government. Okay,

Speaker 2:          02:17:06       good. Iraq, where would they put knowledgeable. Depleted uranium. Exactly. These soldiers coming back from the Gulf War and everything else. We're dumping all the fucking depleted uranium over and over there. It's a dumping ground for us. They're getting fudges dumping they were using and we're using it as meant they were putting it in in they in. They will weaponizing and and then all the fucking troops are coming back. Having fucking kids with deformities and getting cancer and all this shit turned down for their benefits. Yeah, they denied it was even it fucking. What the fuck is that

Speaker 3:          02:17:38       care that it's all about money for them. They're there. They're distantly removed from it. The same way someone's distantly removed from factory farming. If they buy a burger at a restaurant or a burger at a fast food joint, then not thinking about a pig that's in that can, that makes that mcrib they're not thinking about that. And the people that connect. Yeah, and the people that are thinking about the numbers on the paper. Look, they're number crunchers. They gotta to save the government some money, deny them, deny them, make them fight

Speaker 2:          02:18:07       for syndrome. My uncle gave up. Did you see the attachment? Speaking of, uh, the military industrial complex, did you see the latest movie that came out with Woody Harrelson? Shocking. Alive. You seen that? You know, I didn't say about how. Oh, they uncovered the whole fucking thing about how the fucking weapons of mass destruction was just a complete lie. Every news media outlet except for one lied and backed up the government's claim and the whole shit that times all times ended up apologizing like we got it wrong. So you go in there, you fucking send troops in there, you fucking kill how many millions of fucking innocent people over there and add it to what to sell to sell fucking weapons. And, and push another

Speaker 3:          02:18:51       in the eye and then there's the justification after the act. Well, hey, it was a good thing to get Saddam Hussein there out of there anyway. He was a bad guy,

Speaker 2:          02:18:58       but you haven't worked with him in the early eighties and gave him the fucking gas that he used. So what the fuck is like? You know, that was just some yeehaw shit. Fucking homeboy.

Speaker 3:          02:19:11       No, well it was, it was. They took advantage of an opportunity. We got attacked, you know, September 11th. The planes get hit by the towers, got hit by the planes. Everybody wanted to action and this was an opportunity for them to take advantage of this call for action. And though we're going against someone that had nothing to do with the attacks on September 11th, people felt like something was happening.

Speaker 2:          02:19:33       The head guy from, from, from a department of defense was like, well, what do you mean they're fucking, you gotta see this movie. It's all fact based too. It's like, what do you mean we're going in Iraq? Didn't have anything to do with it. What the fuck are we going into, IRA? Oh, well he, you know, and then they tried to say he led a Osama bin Ladin if the NSF, if Osama bin Ladin met Saddam was saying face to face, he would tell them to go fuck himself. That's how different ideologies. Those two hats.

Speaker 3:          02:20:03       Yeah, Sama Bin Ladin was religious. He's.

Speaker 2:          02:20:09       It's fucking crazy. Yeah, they just sold it. They kept. But what's great about the movie is it shows how they just started force feeding the information out there to create this fucking feverish, kill, kill, kill fucking mentality that the Americans.

Speaker 3:          02:20:27       Well, the same thing. You're seeing what these people screaming at Jim Acosta and you can manipulate dummies mindsets and this is what they do. I mean this is an easy way to pull the strings of the most easily lead. You got to think who's going to these rallies in the first place? Most of these people that are going to these trump rallies or something like that, they're morons. That's why they're going to these things. They don't have shit to do. Even if you're a trump supporter, if you're an intelligent trump supporter, which I do believe is possible, you're a person who's not going to go to a rally. You have, you have a job.

Speaker 2:          02:20:59       Jimmy Brady, he's a fucking iron man. He's a firefighter in New York. He's fucking got three kids, a lot of the New York city fire fire department and Police Department supported trump. He ain't going to no fucking trump rallies. I mean he's, you know, he's a fucking really smart cat and, and, and

Speaker 3:          02:21:16       those people are lost people and they found their hero and this, the problem with a guy like trump is, he's like, he's an asshole, but like he's an asshole on purpose. Like this is part of his shtick is you attack me, I'll attack you back, you know, and he starts making fun of Rosie O'donnell or making fun of this.

Speaker 2:          02:21:38       Had Amanda, we knew how to deal with people like did you see his whole shit that they put in the 13th? And like, you know, he was talking to the black people that were in the fucking. We knew the cops knew how to deal with these guys back back in the day, punch him in the face, Kinnaman, and then they were. He's inciting a lot of this shit going rabble rouser. Yeah, I mean, that's part of being an asshole. Divide and conquer, divide and conquer. If they could keep the people fighting each other over stupid shit, then you're not going to take the time to sit back. I compare those, you know, what's really going on? I, I use the analogy of, of a magician. They're trying to tell you, look what's in the left hand, but what the real shit is in the right hand.

Speaker 2:          02:22:22       So by doing all this shit and causing all these problems, you're not going to go back and look at the shit that he's pushing through his agendas. He just cut taxes to the fucking enriches people that, uh, the billionaires and cooperation, which he said he wasn't going to do. He's gone back on everything. So if he could just get people, fuck you and fuck you. And getting people to hate each other and keep this country is to United States of America. When the fuck, how did we become united as a country like I think a lot of these countries right now who may pose a threat or whatever, they're seeing what the fuck's going on and they're like, Yo, this country has never been more fucking divided. It's divided states of America, not the United States of America.

Speaker 3:          02:23:11       Well, what he's doing with these, these rallies is he's getting people excited about being a part of a team and a team that's winning. You know, like where the team is kicking ass and this is team fake news over there. You tell them to go fuck themselves and nobody gets Ya, Ya, Ya. He's consolidating his support. He and it doesn't have to make sense and especially it doesn't have to make sense with the people that are going to these rallies because they're not smart people in the first place. There are people that are easily led, but that's the same thing with people that would go to the rallies for Hillary Clinton. There are people that go to the rallies for almost all these people. A giant chunk of them are just, they're just lemmings. I don't know what to do.

Speaker 2:          02:23:45       I do have to hit one thing and that was when fuck it and Hillary Clinton Clinton was losing and the faces of the crying people who were like fucking losing their shit when trump won. I was like, I'm sorry, but like fucking dude, if that's the fucking truth of your existence that you put every fucking ounce of your shit into this fucking corrupt as politician, whether it's fucking Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders on any of them. I feel fucking sorry for you. I was laughing at those people when she lost, enabled losing their shit on TV. Like they were just fucking stand that. I'm like, because you don't realize I travel through America and people may be progressive on the outskirts, but go into the middle. It is motherfucker. And see what you got fucking step voted for that.

Speaker 3:          02:24:43       Yeah. Well there was also people realize that she was corrupt. I mean, you did a good job of calling her corrupt

Speaker 2:          02:24:49       Hillary. Absolutely. The. He just kept. The mantra was going, he loves mantras and he pushes those fucking. But they just had. Yes. Yeah, correct. So Tracy, Bernie crazy burn, he's

Speaker 3:          02:25:03       a, he's a, he's a good manipulator in that sense, but she knows she didn't do any services, but there was also like a lot of the women that were really upset where like this guy was in that video saying you take girls and grab them by the Pussy, and so they, they felt like this was going to give men a licensed to be sexually abusive. And I think that in a of ways is what started the ball rolling with the me too movement. It wasn't just the exposing of monsters like Bill Cosby, but it was also the fact that you're dealing with this guy who gets in the White House. That's clearly not what you want. You want. If it's a man, you want a man who respects women, who's a statesman, who's a person who has worked their life to get to that position. Not a person who did it as an afterthought once they were already famous.

Speaker 3:          02:25:52       See, like the difference between a guy like Obama, like Obama's probably. He's probably measured his words ever since he was in college because he was hoping one day he would be president. Whereas a guy like donald trump's just been banging hoes and fucking flight around the jet with his name on it since the eighties. I mean this is what the guy did. So then once he's in office, people like, no, I couldn't believe like how could this have happened? This is the pussy grabber. He's not supposed to be in there and I get their pain. I understand it. It is also funny. No, but something like the women's on her knees with the glasses. You ever seen a check with the screaming. She's like, she's a meme. She will. She will again. They made a, they call it trump derangement syndrome now because people are literally, they're so angry that he is in power and there's nothing they can do about it, but the problem is that anger and that that going derange that that empowers the people that support him.

Speaker 3:          02:26:55       They don't understand when you're on your knees screaming, fuck the people on the other side of the trump supporters, their fucking red hats on. They think that's hilarious. This is the liberal left, unhinged, detached from reality. Meanwhile, we're making America great again and black unemployment is at an all time low and you know, it's, it's a weird time for the truth because there's so many people that don't want to go any further past the surface that the truth is this guy figured out a way to win a rigged system. He did. He figured out a way, uh, when a rig system by pretending to be a republican guy was a democrat his whole life, democratic supporters his whole life figured out a way. Oh, just puck a, be a Republican. They're easier to scam weaseled his way in, figured out a way. This whole make America great again.

Speaker 3:          02:27:43       Yeah. Ra, Ra, Ra, call people a bunch of stupid shit campaign like a motherfucker. Take Diet pills, keep that energy high. Just travel all across the country doing these rallies and one, you know, and want a system that really shouldn't be there to win. And I think that we need a better way to run our government. And the idea is fucking genius. Having an Alpha male or Alpha female, that one person, the one at the top of the peak running $300, million people's insane 300 people's insane. You have 300 people, one person running shit. You're going to have disagreements. You're going to have people that are upset that this one person gets to dictate for the next four to eight years. The path of everyone in this group and your financial future, your health care, your. You're all these how much taxes you pay, all depending on what dipshit winds the popularity contest.

Speaker 3:          02:28:34       That's outrageous. It's an archaic way of handling things. It's just not necessary, but the problem with letting everybody vote too is that people are really easily manipulated and they're really undereducated people. They don't have any incentive to pay attention to the real issues and what's at stake and what the consequences of each vote are. They just vote with whatever feels good and they're busy and people are tired because they're eating shitty food and exercise and they're working all day in a job that sucks and they come home, their wives, Bitch Adam and they're on antidepressants and pills and there the kids are all fucked up and they don't have the time. They don't have the time and they don't have the incentive to be enlightened. They don't have the incentive to have an objective in lightened approach to how you handle the future of our society and what our children are going to be left with.

Speaker 4:          02:29:22       Well, that's why it's the genius of these commercials if you. I mean it's. I, I can't even watch TV when it's election time because it's just like one dude after the next shitting on each other or this person saying that we should mark them for you. It's like the two things that you get when that shit goes on. One of those political commercials in into was all the commercials for the pharmaceuticals, but that's every fucking night. There's two countries on earth, New Zealand, New Zealand, and America is where you're allowed to direct advertising to customers, to patients. What the fuck is that race? Is that crazy? And I love the commercials now where the dude figures it out. Well, you asked about Warfarin and I'd be happy because people were walking down the street and you see cartoon flowers around them and butterflies and now if your antidepressants is not working, fine, we'll fix that up. A side effects include suicidal thought. It's like motherfucker. I had suicidal thoughts before. Like Roche's, rectal bleeding, know some of the side effects are crazy. It's fucking insane.

Speaker 3:          02:30:31       Vilifies the. It's an anti psychotic. It's the number one prescribed medication in the country.

Speaker 4:          02:30:37       Abilify, abilify, really? Number one. Prescribed medication. The country. Wow. It's an anti psychotic fuck. Yeah. What? Insane. I know you're like, what? That's insane. Pull that up. Make sure that's true. I know I read that, but make sure that it's true. Somebody talked about that on the podcast. Who Was it? Do you remember article in Twenty 15 saying it is the America's top selling drug. Pinson, anti-psychotic, Yo. Abilify is the biggest, biggest selling prescription jug and the US is a fucking pill. Damn top seller. A drug has to be expensive. It's also widely used. Holly's abilify is both expensive and wildly used. It's the 14th prescribed brand name medication and it retails for $30 a pill. So it's the biggest selling prescription drug in the US. So it's the biggest thing in, of WHO's behind it. It's a good question. Who is behind it? Put Satan. Satan pharmaceuticals. America's top selling drug. I best like abilify. It's terrifying. Fishel site. Let's see. Scumbag.

Speaker 4:          02:31:46       They're the worst. Did you ever read confessions of Duka? Did you ever read Sukha? Sukha, Sukha. They're probably, they probably changed names. Cloud, they do keep switching up their names. You ever did? Well, now they, uh, they changed a fucking, what do you call it to, um, changing the name on all these ingredients that are in food to like, um, what is the, uh, the additive, the sweetener that Donald Aspartame, aspartame, they changed their name to Aminos suite now because you know, who owns the patent on fucking as aspartame didn't. Donald, Donald, Rumsfeld, Donald Rumsfeld had something to do with it. Own Stat. Well, you had something to do with passing it. Yeah. He had something to do with ignoring evidence, but see, someone told me that the amount of chemicals they had to give to rats, the amount of aspartame, they had to give the rats to kill them or to give them cancer was very high and I'm like, okay, that's good.

Speaker 4:          02:32:50       That's reassuring, but there's a great book about the corruption of the pharmaceutical companies and it's a. can you google this title real quick? It's called confessions of Gwen Olson wrote a book called confessions of an Rx drug pusher and I think it was her niece died of a drug interaction that they knew about and she exposed the whole corruption in the pharmaceutical industry. She was a top pharmaceutical rep and they said they know how does a drug get approved by the FDA and then they turn around and fucking they pull it and people are dying and they settle for pennies on the dollar. That's the fucking game. They know there's going to be lawsuits and they're like, okay, we just made $3,000,000,000 off this drug and we settled that lawsuit for $200 billion. So that's a hundred million, 200 million. Right? So that's the game. That's. But her book is amazing.

Speaker 4:          02:33:43       It's called confessions of an Rx drug pusher and that's what she was. And she would buy out the doctors. Half the people that they put on these medications, all they have to say is change your fucking lifestyle, dude. What is, what is the father of modern medicine? Hypocrisy is, what did he say? Let thy food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food. There's also an IRA. Vedic, I don't know if you know about the Irish vedic system of Madison and it says when, when, when, uh, when, uh, you know, there's a whole quote about diet and, and made it and, and uh, and, and, uh, seeing a

Speaker 2:          02:34:17       doctor and stuff like that. And it's all, it comes back to one thing, man. Diet and lifestyle. Like what the fuck are you doing? Tell people. And that's what's great about a movie like forks over knives where there's anecdotal evidence that says, Yo, if you stopped, do you see the change right there? The fucking diabetes goes away, the fucking heart disease, all, all of this stuff is, uh, is cured by the fact that these people get to assets moving and they stopped eating all this shitty food.

Speaker 3:          02:34:46       Yeah. Shitty food is the number one problem is the number one problem. Sugar, refined carbohydrates, your body processing massive amounts of stuff that it's not supposed to get in. Everything boils in everything. And you know, all these processed vegetable oils like cooking things in

Speaker 2:          02:35:03       all that stuff. And People Think, oh, you know, even to assert

Speaker 3:          02:35:08       what do you got here, Jeremy? Donald run. So the FDA actually banned aspartame based on his findings, only to have cereal chairman Donald Rumsfeld, currently secretary of defense at the time they wrote this article, vow to call in his markers to get it approved on January 21st 1991 the day after Ronald Reagan's inauguration. Cyril, I guess that's c a r l e reapply to the FDA for approval to use aspartame. And food sweetener and Reagan's new FDA Commissioner Arthur Hayes Hall junior appointed a five person scientific commission to review the board of inquiry. Decision became clear. The panel would uphold the band by a three to two to two decision, but then hold, then install the sixth member on the commission and the vote became deadlocked. He then personally broke the tie and aspartame favor what a piece of shit.

Speaker 2:          02:36:04       But this is, this puts, they found evidence. This shit makes holes in the brain.

Speaker 3:          02:36:09       It might induce the. The evidence grains might induce migraine tumors.

Speaker 2:          02:36:15       Right? And the thing is now everyone got hipped to aspartame. Now you have to read because that's why the process. Food is so fucking any of that here, that fake sweetness shit. And now they call it amino suite is the new name that they changed it to. So.

Speaker 3:          02:36:33       Well you, you. Do you ever drink your drinks? Soda, Soda sweetened with Stevia. Stevia. It's fucking delicious. Stevia's from plants. It's a sweetener and people don't like it,

Speaker 2:          02:36:45       great taste of Stevia. It tastes good. But I do have too much protein powders that have a, you know, a Stevia in it and stuff. Clean machine has a protein powder that's a lentin and uh, the water lentils, they call them. It's real, real clean.

Speaker 3:          02:37:04       Yeah. Are on it. Hemp force protein. We were using Stevia. Stevia for that. I've called Stevia nuts, debbie. But that title potato, which just doesn't taste the same, tastes good. It's a matter

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       of. But it's so potent. The problem is like if people have a cup of coffee, I would have stevie out and people put it in there and be like, oh, I'd be like, you put too much in. He can't put it in like sugar. That's way more potent. You just need a tiny dash. Like even back in the day, I remember my mom being like, oh, Yay, nutrasweet and this and that. Let's put all these other like, cane sugar is better for you than these fucking fake sweeteners. Sugar still terrible for you. Terrible for you. You're not close as a sugar daddy in the body. You're going to do sugar. You should do eat fruit. Come to the fibers in your body, slowly digesting it, which is the way you're supposed to consume it, but you'd be able to get like a gatorade. It's got like fucking 80 grams of sugar and they're like, that shit's terrible for you.

Speaker 1:          02:38:02       All that stuff terrible for you. Soda, and they got all the pros pushing it. Like these kids, you go to these a basketball camp, so football cancel or whatever, or high schools and what are they drinking? They're all drinking, drinking the Koolaid. Well, you know what, if you're exerting yourself like very strenuously, you could use some of that glucose and that's okay, but for the average person that goes to a fucking 7:11 and gets a big gulp and his downing, you know, 64 ounces of Coca Cola, that is a crazy amount of sugar for your body to get in one serving. Your body doesn't know what to do with that shit. So it stores it as fat. What I forget how many tablespoons of sugar they said he's in one of them. Fucking a big gulp. Do they did a thing where they showed all the various sizes of soda next to have the sugar and you see the actual, the actual sugar. It's crazy. Yeah. This is our number one problem and one of the things that I did when I cut sugar out of my died, there it is. There's the image that's a kilo of coke son, sides of that. That's so much sugar. Your body doesn't know what the fuck's going on when you take that much sugar and it's insane and it's freaking thing is. You got kids jacked up on that all day long. Bouncing off the wall. Yeah, and then they put them on Ritalin because Johnny's got too much energy. Johnny's on drugs. Yes. Sugar drug

Speaker 3:          02:39:25       long. Yeah. I mean, and then on top of that, here's one of the problems with people consuming that kind of stuff and then on top of it's saturated fat or your kids set. See, there's studies now that are showing that cholesterol and saturated fat are healthy for your diet and healthy for your body in less. You're consuming carbohydrates and refined sugars because when you're doing that, then your body's not burning fat, so your body is just storing fat and on top of that you're pouring massive amounts of sugar in there, so you're getting hardening of the arteries and clogging of the arteries and people think that this is. They're conflating and confusing all this and thinking, well, well, this is because you're eating cholesterol and saturated fat. Nope, it's not. It's because you're eating cholesterol and saturated fat along with simple carbohydrates, refined carbohydrates and sugars. There's a chemical reaction that your body has that when you're eating these two things together becomes toxic. It's

Speaker 2:          02:40:21       dangerous night. Trust Semites as well. When you say that's the average American diet, and then combine it with alcohol and the rest of this stuff, it creates a a chemical reaction in the body that then causes a problems for you health wise and your immune system and gut health and everything else.

Speaker 3:          02:40:40       Yeah, there's A. There's a ton of problems with people's bodies and you could trace it back to a host of different things. You could. You could trace it back to pesticides. You could trace it back to a lack of minerals. You can trace it back to excess sugar, you can trace it back to processed vegetable oils, you can trace it back to sedentary lives. There's so many different things that are a factor in people's health issues, but one of the problems with ideologies, whether it's this carnivore diet ideology or Vegan Diet audiology, is people want to look at one thing. There's one thing that's wrong and you fix this thing, and if you just do this one thing, you're going to be healthy. That's not necessarily the case, and there's a lot of people out there on both sides that are spreading misinformation because it supports their view. It supports their bias positioning

Speaker 2:          02:41:29       studies that were funded by the same companies that are making money off of selling foods that are high in saturated fats or cholesterol or trans fats, trans fats in it. There's companies. So you always have to look between the fucking lines. That's where the truth lies because the milk industries. What was the other, uh, the other documentary that came out, um, fuck it was about. It started with the cigarettes and the uh, and the chemicals that they were using in furniture day. There was this documentary to, and I always blank on it. I'm fucking old man brain and I have. It was a documentary about how they paid these people to put out false information.

Speaker 3:          02:42:14       I know you're talking about merchants of death, merchants of doubt, amazing fucking shame. People that are doubting climate change. We're also touting cigarettes being addicted the same

Speaker 2:          02:42:24       and they're using the same tactics that they've been using and to push the chemicals and put. They had motherfuckers spraying DDT on their fucking clothes hanging in their closet to stop moths. Can you fucking believe that shit, dude, it's in that. It's in the way they had them spraying fucking Dick Cancer causing chemicals on this shit.

Speaker 3:          02:42:52       When you see those guys have the same guys that were trying to say that cigarettes are not, they're not addictive and the same people that are there, there were dismissing climate change. You're like, what? Like, how can you be so obvious? You don't even use new people.

Speaker 2:          02:43:04       They, they, they did the thing with the guy from Monsanto and roundup, because I would drink fucking roundup and he. Okay, I'm going to go get you a fucking glass. Here's a glass of fucking drink, like drink it. He's like, nope.

Speaker 3:          02:43:17       Who does this? Jamie? Is that DDT wallpaper? Yeah. Oh my God. Look at that. Containing Ddt as the active insecticide, genuine cedar wood made into wallpaper. So these people made DDT closet wallpaper with fucking, with genuine cedar wood.

Speaker 2:          02:43:38       Well, the other thing is, even the chemicals that they put in the furniture, there's a big thing now to remove because it's calming the fucking children. Do you know that rugs and furniture actually will release chemicals into the air in your house. Oh, you have this protective.

Speaker 3:          02:43:54       Sure. Children's against disease carrying insects, DDT, children's room, wallpaper. How many kids got cancer from that shit? Crazy fucking bed is so insane. Kills insects. Mosquitoes, flies. Ants. And you,

Speaker 2:          02:44:10       you know, one of the biggest, one of the. One of the biggest ways that toxins enter the body is not by walking around the streets of La or New York and breathing into pollution. It's the fucking home, the amount of chemicals that are in the fucking home, and they talk about that in merchants of doubt to chemicals in the furniture, the chemicals in the closed, the chemicals in the fucking diapers to chemicals in everything in the plastic. It's chemicals, chemicals, chemicals, chemicals. You're bombarding your fucking child with fucking dozens and dozens of chemicals every fucking day. And while it's immune throughout that child's immune system is developing and then you're feeding it pesticides, you're feeding it. This fucking animal that's been tortured. It's whole life and Fed fucking steroids and hormones. And you're wondering why these kids are coming out and they're so fucked because it's when they're getting into their teens, it's because all of that shit's taken a toll.

Speaker 2:          02:45:06       Not just physically, but you know, psychologically it's fucking, it's, you know, then, you know, there's so much other shit they're doing to, to the, to the food put in, put in. Um, there's an episode, you know, that they put in the corn and the soy now and it's fucking, uh, it was done by this company in La and they will, oh, I was down in California somewhere, episode e p I c Dot y, t, and it fucks with the sexual reproduction organs of, of fetuses and children and all kinds of shit they do. They're conducting like fucking mad science on human beings right now. What the fuck is going on? Just for profit even in Hawaiian, I got to tell you, I have friends that are out there and they did organic farming, organic farming. Do you know that? All the world seed banks right now for GMO or fucking grown in Hawaii because of it's a closed ecosystem that's closed off from everywhere else. So there's no other factors. So they go and they spray motherfucking chem trails, the air

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       that calmed down onto the fucking ground and they can, for instance, and I wait a minute, what do they do? They're spraying aerosol spraying the crops. So the aerosol, so some sort of. So what they do and they do aluminum. Barium, strontium. Now I'm going to tell you, I have, I have friends that actually are doing this. They were aghast farmers and I had to give up their farm and what they do is they make the, to the uh, the making the soil so acidic the Ph, then nothing will grow except for genetically modified seeds that have been genetically modified to resist aluminum and resist all this other stuff. So now the spraying aluminum, like where's that coming from? It's, it makes it, makes the soil various civic it, it changes the Ph. I think aluminum has the greatest, a change to the soil and what's the benefit of them doing that because then they can control the food supply because if you don't buy the GMO seeds, the organic farmers are going out of business in Hawaii.

Speaker 4:          02:47:13       And this ain't no, wait a minute. So you're saying that they're spreading things out of the sky that poisoned the ground so that only organic farmers are so that only gmo farmers can grow crops there. Right? That's proven. That's what's going on. And it sounds crazy though, but here's the thing, and I'm not saying they're going like some of these other camp trail people, $35,000, they're spraying all the cities I'm spraying. I'm saying that coming in and spraying chemicals on the ground, but they're not doing it as a pesticide. You're saying they're doing it as a grand conspiracy to make the ground infertile for anything. Do you ever read Monsanto's. Did you ever see the world according to Monsanto? Okay. So what do they say? We want to control the world's food supply from seed to motherfucking to farm to table, all the way through. We want to control.

Speaker 4:          02:48:04       So how did they do that? How do they actually make that happen? And I see it happening to farmers in Hawaii and friends of mine are ag. I just did ironman. What do you see happening? Because what they're doing, the, the, the, the, the organic Papaya farmers have had to all go either give up their farm or go switch to a GMO Papaya because none of their shit is growing. It's just that because the depletion of the soil, not it's, but they say that the fucking day spraying the chemicals on the soil, but do you know how much they'd have to spray on the soil to make it infertile? It's much more likely candidate to the same issues that we're having in this country with mono crops that they're just depleting their soil because they're constantly growing on it. No, because these guys are doing organic study chem trails that study chem trails for quite a while because I was doing a television show on them and one of the things that I found with this, this is a lot of Malarkey. Absolutely shit, and one of the things that they find is they're like, oh, they're

Speaker 3:          02:49:08       spraying aluminum and then when they do samples of the water, they find aluminum in the water. Now they're doing samples of sludge. This do samples of water with dirt. Do you know with one of the most common metals that you'll ever find on earth is aluminum. Aluminum. Most dirt has aluminum in it, so when they're testing this water, they're testing positive for aluminum. What they're doing is it tested dirt, dirt tested positive for being dirt. That's what it is. So when they find a aluminum, they say, oh my God, they're spraying aluminum. There's no benefit to spraying aluminum on anything. It's never been proven that there's some evil government cabal that wants to spray aluminum on everything and that's the reason why papayas don't grow. Right. It's way more likely that these papayas are growing in a place where they've been grown papayas for a long time and they've depleted the soil, especially dealing with soil that's really coming out of a volcano in the first place.

Speaker 2:          02:49:58       Well, I mean I understand that aspect of it, but it's the combination of other chemicals that they're using. And here's the thing. Before these seed banks showed up over there, they never had this problem.

Speaker 3:          02:50:11       There's also before large scale agriculture made its way to Hawaii as well, right? So they probably had years and years and years of doing this and getting away with it to the soil started getting depleted. Just like we have evidence of it getting depleted all over the world. India, they have issues with this, with mono crops, with anywhere in the world where they grow crops in the same area, in these massive scales, you're going to deplete the ground of minerals and nutrients. I mean it's just a part of the problem and when they offer up that solution like, hey, our genetically modified crops are better in are genetically, you know, people modified crops are, you know, they can survive in these harsh climates and you can also add all of our nitrogen and our fertilizers are nasty shit to the.

Speaker 2:          02:50:54       Everything else around it will die when we spray except for our crops because we've been genetically engineered to resist. We been genetically engineered to resist.

Speaker 3:          02:51:06       Yeah, that's scary. That glyphosate shit is any, anything that kills everything. But what you, what you want it to is like what? Like what's it doing to what you wanted to. What happens to that food? What is that stuff out of that food by the time you eat it?

Speaker 2:          02:51:20       Um, I don't think so. I don't think so either. I mean, when it comes out in the leaves and the bugs eat this shit and it blows their stomach, there's a

Speaker 3:          02:51:30       great documentary on it called what's with wheat, where they try to break down why wheat all the sudden became a huge problem in the American diet, whereas in the early 19 hundreds it was nothing and it was a slow genetic modification where they. They started changing the weed itself and breeding it to make higher yields, so it's got more complex gluten's in it, but then on top of that, it's the glyphosate. The glyphosate breaks down your gut barrier and people get leaky gut and the rest of the yeah buts it kills the bacteria. I mean, this is what they're trying to do that trying to kill bacteria, but they don't realize your made out

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       of bacteria. Your body's an ecosystem of bacteria, right? Yeah. That's just the problem with the whole government is evil thing is they're just greedy or evil because they're greeting, right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:52:19       Thing and, and you saw the world according to Monsanto and it's this revolving door policy. How they come at a massage, Monsanto or even what he was doing, Rumsfeld, when he was the CEO of Searle. And then so they get into the government, they pass legislation and they go back to the corporations to reap the benefits of the laws that they passed. You have a lot of that going on. So I think, uh, you know, whether or not she could really be what the fuck motherfuckers is saying it is in Hawaii or anywhere else and the truth is going to possibly come out eventually or maybe not, but me personally, I tend to try to stick to locally farmed organic like I go to the farm is mark, how do you get it in New York? This farmer's market from upstate and yeah, they could. They come up, they come into the city.

Speaker 2:          02:53:12       Um, I mean I'm, I'm not going to bullshit. I go to a health food store and eat shit that's out of season because I like my fucking Broccoli and Kale or whatever the fuck and some fruit or whatever. But um, you know, how do they grow that stuff, shipped it shipped in from Cali. And in Florida, I mean, you know, it's not the best, but hey, when you take into equation the fact that I've eliminated this, this, the other foods that used the highest amount of fossil fuels to grow the crops and, and everything else that's involved with producing the, a huge, you know, these farms that are, that are, uh, these animal agriculture system than the amount of fossil fuels. I mean, I had motherfuckers writing me, you take a fucking plane and go on tour. Fuck you. Like the thing we were talking about earlier, fault every fucking thing, you know. But, but a true though, we all do. Do you sda both

Speaker 1:          02:54:12       poisoned sky a little bit when we fly.

Speaker 2:          02:54:15       So, hey, you know, I'll take, I'll take the hit man.

Speaker 1:          02:54:20       We live in a real problem. I mean that's one of the things they found after September 11th with the lack of plane flights changed the Earth's temperature. I mean, it's fucking nuts, man. Wow, that's crazy. Yeah. The also the cloud cover that's created by contracts like that cools the earth down a little bit. It's very interesting. They've admitted to it.

Speaker 2:          02:54:41       The government has actually admitted to a program to try to sprain shit, to try to

Speaker 1:          02:54:47       cool the earth's well. They've admitted to experimented with weather manipulation and to, to having strategies for dealing with it, whether it is for dealing with hostile foreign governments where trying to starve them out or trying to put

Speaker 3:          02:55:03       rain. I mean they've been around forever.

Speaker 2:          02:55:06       We have a space. Would you see the fucking video? Hey guys made on space for now. What is it? Is it funny? It's fucking hilarious. They, they, uh, it's on youtube. The spool on, on trump's space. It's fucking. But here's the thing. It's like China repair is trying to patch a shotgun wound with a bandaid. Like let's reduce the fossil fuel. If you want to fucking cool the earth and everything and save the fucking oceans and all the rest of this shit. It's why don't we check how the fuck we live our lives. But everybody wants to pass the buck and say, oh, well why should I do it? You know, let the next motherfucker do it. But you know, you buy what you put in your car and how you live your life and you have fucking how many people in America? $200. How many? Three hundred million. $300. Fucking million motherfuckers passing the buck along. You're not getting anywhere. And China's how many billion in India? And it's like they're not fucking, they're not going to stop fucking doing what they're doing.

Speaker 3:          02:56:09       No, no they're not. And it's again, it's like what we were talking about with all the other aspects of gigantic culture. There's so many moving pieces. It's so, it's so difficult because we're, we're talking about these pieces that have been in place for decades and so to try to make corrections now and you know, and some people are, they are going to organic farms. They are going to raising their own food and having it, you know, having everything be local. And that's definitely better. But the real problem it seems to me is overpopulation. And the real problem is when you jam, you know, Los Angeles is a perfect example. There's 200 million people just here in it just to get a million, excuse me, 20 million, 20 million people. That's ridiculous. 20 million people just here and then there's Orange County which has more people. San Diego has more people as you get north of people in San Francisco because we got like morning. He people fucking millionaire. There's more people. There's more people in California just in Santa, just in La. The more people in Los Angeles than there is in all of Australia. Just all just insane. So there's so many people and no one's grown anything other than we just weeds being grown here and that's it. So all the food is being shipped in from everywhere else and so you've got fossil fuels being used and then

Speaker 2:          02:57:28       you pay more in Hawaii for a fucking pineapple. Then you do on the mainland. That crazy dude. It's fucking insane. You haven't been there. How expensive for cat food?

Speaker 3:          02:57:36       Everything's very expensive. Fucking insane. It's a beautiful, beautiful place though and that's why people are willing to take that hit. We. We live in a place that humans like yourself and myself and people that are alive today, we are stuck in a system that was created many, many decades ago. It was put into place many decades ago and it wasn't put into place with our interests in mind. It was put into place with the interest mind a profit, and it was also to deal with the, to accommodate millions and millions of people that are all jammed into one place where no one's growing any food. It's a very unnatural way to live.

Speaker 2:          02:58:11       You know, they started coming down on all the people fucking growing a shade on their front lawns and yards now because urban organic farm into, you know, I'm, I'm in touch with a lot of those people. As a matter of fact, there's one in, in New York City I ride from New York city out to like Long Island Jones beach and all that. And I pass in far rockaway. It is a guy that he's doing like a big urban farm. The in this thing and you know, in this crop of land, and uh, you know, it's the urban farming is becoming a big thing because if I it the food desert is, and there was one guy on abc and he walked home from work every night and it was five miles African American guy and he's trying to lose weight and get healthy. Well, guess what? Every motherfucking night all he passed was KFC. This, that, the other thing, 7:11. He could not buy a fucking piece of fruit or a fucking apple in any of those fucking places. None. So then they said, well, how the fuck are we going to get food if we ain't got no car, we can go seven, 10 miles out of town to the supermarket. So now urban, organic farming is becoming a big thing where they're showing these pen, now they're starting to crack down. The cities are trying to crack down on these people that are growing fucking food. That's ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          02:59:29       Crazy. I had Ron Finley on this podcast and he's got a similar program in south central and uh, he helps these kids and people that live there use vacant lots. Use Medians in Detroit too. Yeah, it's fantastic. Yeah. Grow food. You got all fucking fruit. Food would be free. Grow it, grow it. And Patches of land. I mean, what would be ideal is if every community, instead of just having a house jam next to a house, gym next to a house, every community have one community lot and that community lot. We all grow our food in,

Speaker 2:          03:00:01       you know, not hard to do. I mean even in a fucking closet did, showing how to do like they just had this, they had a shipping container in New York and it was a demonstration and they put it on a Lafayette and Lafayette Street and Houseton and it was a shipping container and they did all. And when you walked in there, it was a fucking farm and I forget how many thousand pounds of organic produce that, that fucking farm inside that shipping container was able to grow. But it's insane.

Speaker 3:          03:00:34       No, that's the artificial light. But you could do that with real life, the real streets that you see everywhere you go, what, where concrete is, it could be dirt and then it is possible that we could cordon off a small section of every community and have a community garden and it would also be a good. It would be good for the community in terms of people interacting with each other and feeling like they're a part of something and taking responsibility for taking care of.

Speaker 2:          03:01:02       Get your hands in the dirt too, man. You know, it's, it's very, like, that's one of the programs that we did in this documentary. We added a guy's going to fall organic farms and getting their hands in the dirt and seeing, you know, people just as a disconnect between like, you know, farmers man, I gotTa, you know, it's like that's a fucking hard ass fucking job. Fucking hard ass job. Fucking hard man. We don't show the appreciation. And I think who was the, um, the one black activists who used to run the marathons and shit. He forget his name in the sixties and Gregory Dick fucking Gregory, man. He always talked about, you know, growing your own fucking food and, and

Speaker 3:          03:01:46       no Dick Gregory's the guy who brought the Zapruder film to television is approved or film of Kennedy being assassinated. It looks like he's being shot from the front. What? Yes. Dick Gregory brought that to the Geraldo Rivera show. Wow. Years after the assassination. It might've been more. More than eight. Might have been more. Know a lot of shit. Yeah. The, it might've been 10 years after the assassin. Something crazy, but it didn't. People didn't see Kennedy get assassinated until many, many, many years after when this guy's approved or who was there on the spot was filming. They took his, his film and he sold it to time life magazine. They use stills of it and then they didn't show it. What, 12 years? Twelve years later. Seventy five. Wow. So on 75 and the Geraldo Rivera show, they, they premiered the Zapruder film footage of the assassination of President Kennedy from like fucking 20 yards away. He was right. That NDC Kennedy's head go back into the left. It's, you see the spray of blood and you're like, what?

Speaker 2:          03:02:49       So was it, did they show that it was more than one?

Speaker 3:          03:02:53       They can't tell for sure and there's a lot of speculation because there's so many men in black and white and they were shaky back then. They've since use computers to stabilize the image, but what it looks like to the untrained eye is that he shot more than once and probably shot from multiple different angles and the reason why they came up with the magic bullet theory, because they account, they had to account for another bullet that didn't hit the president. They had to account for a bullet that hit it ricocheted under an underpass and hit a guy. So yeah, the bullet had to go through to people and it had a leave traces of the bullet behind that weren't missing for the bullet from the book. And it had a shattered bone and not distort. Which doesn't happen. Yeah. If you know anything about bullets, if you shoot anything, bullets get Jack. They get, they tear up. They, they been, they get, they get sleep.

Speaker 2:          03:03:43       Yeah. You could take fucking lead.

Speaker 3:          03:03:45       Exactly. Yeah. Even if it's jacketed, it's still going to get fucked up. It's hitting bones and shattering at a ridiculous speed. The single bullet theory was also created by Arlen Specter and those fucking guys from the Warren Commission report, bunch of evil assets

Speaker 1:          03:03:58       is a great book on it called a best evidence by David Lifton. David Lipton was an accountant who went over the Warren Commission report step by step every step of the way, and she found all these contradictions in the reporting like this is a bullshit document like when they were trying to do was just wrapped this bitch up nice and tight. They weren't trying to solve the crime. They were trying to wrap this thing up tight and the most ridiculous aspect of it is the magic bullet theory, but before anybody saw this uproot or film, it didn't look that ridiculous. We heard what we were told. Kennedy got shot by Oswald and Jack Ruby shot ours walled. Very convenient, very convenient. The whole thing is ridiculous. I don't know why they killed them, but it's very likely that there was quite a few people involved and not just Lee Harvey Oswald, and he was probably involved.

Speaker 2:          03:04:44       Well, you know, that he passed a resolution. He was fucking with the Federal Reserve. Oh yeah. What was the, uh, one one one. Uh, it was a. well, there's a lot of problems. They have pigs. Hey, a pig.

Speaker 1:          03:04:58       Yeah. There was a, he wanted to get rid of the Federal Reserve. He wanted to get rid of the CIA. Started printing.

Speaker 2:          03:05:04       Nope. A currency backed by. He wanted to go back to the gold, silver standard. He started printing up notes. Fucking if you could find those notes from when he was in silver certificates. And he said, why a private banks controlling our money, the Federal Reserve. It wasn't, I think one of the acts that, uh, George Bush junior passed before he left, or this executive order on one one, one zero to give him the printing of the money back to the fucking take it away from the Federal Reserve. They whacked him just a couple of months later and give it back to the secretary. His father said that they're going to kill you for this. His father told him that you fuck with them. Bankers, man. True. It's uh, you know, comes back to, to, you know, power is not about a conspiracy. It's about Yo. It's about, they want the ultimate greed. It's the ultimate greed. We control everything. Well, especially back then

Speaker 1:          03:06:02       then. I mean, the amount of accountability that politicians had back then you can get away with a lot. There was a lot of wiggle room and you know, it's most likely that somebody other than just Lee Harvey Oswald and he probably had something to do with it too. I mean, he was

Speaker 2:          03:06:18       probably Manchurian candidate. It's man, who knows, they grabbed these guys. They fucking. Who knows does what within, you know, they're still doing it. I believe to this day know a lot of these fucking motherfuckers trying to fucking shoe bombers and this fucking clown and this, you know, there's so much shit going on. Like even the shoe bomber, like who the fuck did he get on a plane with no passport? You know, it's like there's so much shit to just go home.

Speaker 1:          03:06:50       Well you remember that God, that they busted in Dallas, who is a god that they'd set up. They set him up to be an Islamic terrorist. They trained him, they gave him the weapon and then as he was trying to detonate the weapon, they arrested him. It's like you guys talked him into doing this, you gave him the bombs and then you arrested him. Like what would he have done if you guys weren't even there? We've done anything. They, they, they thought that this guy was a person who was suspicious. So they literally set up an entrapped him

Speaker 2:          03:07:21       entrapment. It's Kinda going on. It's going on a lot, man. It's fucking like we don't even notice shit that's going on behind the walls of the fucking offices. Man. It was fucking scared of fucking Bejesus. Addy. If he knew, you know, what the fuck was, uh, you know what? These people's minds, you know,

Speaker 1:          03:07:45       well you get accustomed to make and rationalizations that will cross people their lives and I think anybody that can send a drone to shoot down an apartment building because of Metadata, you know, you found the metadata that seems to indicate that the cell phone of a certain criminal is on the 14th floor. Let the fucking hell fire missiles fly baby. Yeah, I mean that's decisions that they make.

Speaker 4:          03:08:05       That's Virginia city x box controller. Fucking like, you know, disconnected from everything. If you talked to someone from the CIA, they tell you it's all lawyers who make those decisions to lawyers do all the calculations and they go, yeah, you can do it. Crazy. Crazy man. Yeah, dude, we just did three hours a day. We flew by. Well, you know what they say. How do you know when a lawyer is lying? His lips are moving. Hey, I got a good lawyer though. Let me tell you, this guy would be good lawyers. There is good people, good people. Peter Nussbaum I love yet. Shout out to Peter. He just bombed my lawyer. He's not a criminal attorney, so come to the fights this weekend I was invited. I was like, hopefully we get along and have a fucking dope because we got along. It was fine.
