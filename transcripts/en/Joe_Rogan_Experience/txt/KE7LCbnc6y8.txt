Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Like officey and shit like that. But the being able to be in this group of really cool people to me is one of the greatest benefits of being a comedian. And one of the greatest benefits of doing something like a podcast and these guys at Onnit, Aubrey and all of his employees, it's pretty laid back guy. They're the nicest fucking people's he you could ever want to meet. They're approaching business. The idea of a business where it's something that we all enjoy, whether it's supplements for athletics, for, for a nootropics, for the mind or fitness equipment. It's all shit that we use all shit that we feel like there's some real good benefit to having in your life. A Ham force protein powders are an excellent example. It's my favorite protein powder ever. And I'm not saying that because I own a piece of the company.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       If I didn't have anything to do with the company, I will tell you that stuff is the shit cause it's fucking delicious. It's very low in sugar. It has, it has stevia in it for a sweetener, which is a natural sweetener. So it's, it has less than, I believe it's maybe one gram of sugar per serving, but it tastes delicious. It's really easy for your body to process. We use the highest protein content. Hamp available is the best hamp that you can buy and it's difficult to get. We can only buy like 50 pounds of it a day. They limit it because there's so much as a massive amount of demand because hemp cannot be grown in the United States legally. So we have to buy it all from Canada. You could sell it. Yeah, you could sell it. You can eat it. You can have it. Cause it's not psychoactive. But the law states that you cannot grow hemp in the United States so you can get it from other places. Yes, we, we buy ours from Canada. We have to buy it from Canada. Man.

Speaker 2:          00:01:43       It's crazy. So stupid. It's so dumb. And this is not even by the way, that's study

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       drug issue. It says nothing to do with drugs folks, because hemp is not a psychoactive plan. It's just not. It's only by ruthless ignorance that this still exists. Really ruthless. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:02:01       Woeful cooperation with pharmaceutical companies. Farmers telling flowing people like, hey, we'd like to grow the art.

Speaker 1:          00:02:08       They aren't, they would love to. They pass laws. They pass laws in Vermont. Uh, they recently passed.

Speaker 2:          00:02:14       Oh, by the way, today is Washington state legal marijuana day. Congratulations. Everybody says Washington state, he fucking got your shit together. Stick with it. They're the first ones to get your shit together. I was in Washington state wants, and they guy's got me high level gravity bong that they made out of a two liter bottle of soda. They would put tape, they touched off the bottom and then we'll put tape, like double sided tape and they'd fill up this whole thing with six thick, thick smoke. And they're like, hit that. And I was like, yeah. I was like, I couldn't take it all. They were like, what's wrong with you? They would take it all in one hit. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:02:47       Fuck around Seattle. You are bad motherfuckers. Congratulations. And Seattle's going to also try to, um, make a growing hemp, uh, legally goes well, yeah. Well, you know, that's not, no, it's not. It's all just fucking with

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       the federal government, man. The federal government has these wacky positions. I heard some of them block you up because there's a business in locking people up. I heard somebody put it on a ballot like one of the states put on about like, Hey, let's vote on the federal, can't override our, our state laws cause it's not just this sort of state law, federal law things to gay marriage. And they eventually want to be like, Hey, do we have any rights here? Can we make our own shit?

Speaker 1:          00:03:22       Yeah, it gets a certain point in time. It starts getting really ridiculous. Like why are you going after these people? It doesn't make any sense. Like Rhode Island said that they would use their state police to defend their citizens with them against up against federal troops. And these medical marijuana weights cause a lot of these federal troops, by the way, they're not even federal troops. Like they, they, they've used mercenaries before. Yeah. They had people that were, uh, they were wearing black water shirts and they were rating these. Blackwater, blackwater is the government, um, shirts of a, yeah, they were wearing shirts that said they worked for blackwater uniform and they were brave. They were going through these medical marijuana facilities. What? It's crazy with machine guns on their hips. Just some just taking the, we'd taken the weed out. It's the only man who are you?

Speaker 1:          00:04:08       What are you doing? They're like, I'm going, what are you, just some people, cause they have a name, the name is DEA or you know, whatever you want to call it. CIA, FBI. Anybody wants a string, a couple of letters together. Then all of a sudden who they are becomes something different than just a person. They're allowed to do ridiculous shit. Like arrest you for having plants yet you can do about it. No. So we don't sell half a week. We would love to sell on it. Would love to have, um, a whole farm and grow our own hemp. We would love to hire farmers to grow our shit. We would love to keep the economy moving in a good direction by providing something that people want and putting a lot of people to work. It's a hemp is $1 billion tech style just for clothes alone, just for, for the nutrition that you can get from it. It's incredibly nutritious. All He,

Speaker 3:          00:04:56       I think the killer bee honey. Hey, I like making sandwiches. Dangerous. Yeah. I think that's why I never understood that. That's how they have handbags and stuff and all the hippies get like their hemp dresses. It all has to come from that come from outside, from outside. All right. I was always like, how did they not get arrested? They're fuck heads. We have all kinds of crazy shit at on it. Uh, I there's too much to name including Buffalo Jerky and, and uh, yeah. We also have bulletproof coffee. We just started carrying Dave Asprey's awesome coffee. Give me some way that buffalo jerky. Okay, I'll get you some, we might have some in the back. Do we have those boxes, Jamie? Those boxes of a honored supplements in the back of, so grab, grab one of those jerky.

Speaker 3:          00:05:37       It's really good. They'll have low chairs. We have gummy bears for kids that are made out of fish oil. It's really weird. They fucking, you would think they taste bad. It tastes pretty fucking good. My, my two year old, just not mine them. She loves them. She's asking for more and essentially there's no, they'll a little bit, a bit, I can taste it, but she doesn't give a fuck. No, that is, that's, that's buffalo. That's a, a traditional buffalo bar where they, um, they make it with cranberries. Cranberry. Yeah. And the cranberries sort of, yeah. It keeps it a, does that give you a nice chewable bar,

Speaker 4:          00:06:13       pregnant crawfish and it explodes in your mouth. Do you remember? We were on the road somewhere and you go into eat the crawfish head and something blew up in your mouth. Some of those things, it was like a fear factor style. You all spit it up. It was pretty nasty. Like Donna Martin graduates.

Speaker 3:          00:06:38       It was pretty nasty. This is not taste, death, fishy. These nautical Omega three jellies, but your kids will eat them. And it's been shown that fish oil is crucial to a child's development, mental development too. And also mental function. Um, and as well as a muscle recovery like fish oil is amazing. And it's great for joints. Uh, it's, it's really incredible how much different you feel taking fish oil. Like if you, I urge anyone, if you have like knee problems are elbow issues or something like that, try taking a lot of fish oil because fish oil is incredible for that shit. It's an, it's an antiinflammatory, but it also, I don't know what it does, whether it Lubes your, your, your joints, it doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense that we've loads are joining. So that's how I like to look at it.

Speaker 3:          00:07:24       But I think about a doctor I'd make fun of me for saying that. And it was like, this isn't how it works. Dumb ass, but whatever it does, it's awesome. Um, so, uh, that's uh, and that's not even something on it sells bitch. I'm just telling you. Go get yourself some fish oil. Wait, what about you don't have any fish oil? Yeah, for little kids. Why are this is just for little kids. Well you could have them too cause you're kind of a little kid at heart and you like candy. Like, well I don't understand why. It isn't just the idea is that it's just to trick a little kids into taking something healthy into their body. It's a little kids. It's really difficult. Other adults will take fish oil supplements because they know it's good for them. But why don't they just make it the same?

Speaker 3:          00:07:59       Like it's a nice way to take it. It doesn't have to be gross for us. Um, because most people are adults and they don't. They don't. It doesn't, wouldn't it be nicer to have the candy as you take it instead of, I like a big horse pill. I guess. I don't give a fuck. So you give a fuck. It doesn't bother me taking vitamins. I just take them. But wouldn't it be better? No, it wouldn't be [inaudible] Chu woman. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Swallow them. Do you want some of this? No. Thank you. That's the only delicious. Anyway, use a code name broken. This is the longest commercial for on and never use a code name. Rogan. And you will save yourself 10% off any and all supplements. Stamp of approval on the beef jerky. 100 Buffalo Jerky. Yeah, it's bad ass. And this is a 100% money back guarantee on all of the supplements, whether it's Alpha brain or shroom tech or we're only selling you the best shit we could possibly sell you the best shit we can find and nobody's trying to rip you off.

Speaker 3:          00:08:49       So the way it works is you, you bought a supplement and you have a 90 day window to get 100% money back guarantee. You don't have to send the product back. You just say it didn't work for me. Look, the Alpha brain thing is especially controversial because I guess it doesn't, I don't know what anyone's body experiences. I have no idea what coffee does to you. I know what it does to me. Uh, I know what works for me and a, I know it works for a lot of other people. There's a, there's a difference between me when I'm taking nootropics and taking vitamins and eating healthy and when I'm not, and there's a difference in my ability to form sentences for, you know, for me that's, that's a pretty important shit. You know, whether it's doing commentary you're doing stand up or doing this, you know, so Alpha brain to me is a godsend. If I, if I don't have that shit, I panic. Um, we follow a step behind your brand. You can feel it. Yeah. There's some in there. Grabbed, grabbed that box. Give me some of that shit. Nutrients, my friend nutrients for your fucking dome. This is the honest mini CFCs rescue by. Yeah, let's, let's get out of this commercial. Cuban music. I've done enough of these people. Use a code name, Bro. Going to go fuck yourself.

Speaker 5:          00:10:09       Hello savages. Hello. Great people.

Speaker 3:          00:10:13       We're so sorry that we're starting 40 minutes late. But uh, this, uh, this new studio, it has a few bugs. That's how it works folks. It's like when you build a car, it's hot. We're trying to get it haunted. We're trying to get some, I'm an antique clock in here cause you can get a clock. You can get a clock from the 18 hundreds and shit. You know, I, I've found that quite a few of them online. I just think that would be dope. Just have the soul. Yeah, some clock that's been around since the 18 hundreds. You know, it's nice to have a thinking after the past. Yeah, I dunno. It's uh, just kinda creepy and haunted. I think that's kind of bad ass. How fast this stuff hit you. Alpha brain. Um, it doesn't, I don't know how it's going to hit you but it doesn't really hit me.

Speaker 3:          00:11:01       It just sort of ramps me up slowly. It's not like that in or does it just like, no, the first pill you could feel it pretty quickly. I mean you could take to and feel a difference. Your, your, your brain will definitely be stimulated, but when you take it on a regular basis that I find if the best benefits, it's nutrients. You know, it's a, you know, new nutrients are very controversial. There's a lot of people that think you should be able to get everything you can get with your diet. And I say that's kind of silly because you can get everything we want to get with your diet, but you know what you can also do. You can get everything and then take some extra shit and be on top of things. Also, like you can get everything, but who's going to get over there? It's fucking hard. You know? If you like yummy food, if you want to eat salads, like dude, if I was, if I was just thing as you, I would gorge all the time and I'm like, no, you stay as thin as me so you can gorge on occasion.

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       Yeah. Our got big and disciplined himself. Yeah, but then there's Jason Tebow who he can eat a million pizzas with hamburgers inside of them and you still won't even get one little, it's always been him. Jason Tebow. Yeah. Yeah. He's a skinny motherfucker. Some people like that, man, there's, there's dudes who just can't gain weight. That's awesome. I talked to [inaudible] about it. I was like, yeah, it can't just be eating habits. I've got to have some sort of better ability to burn fat than you do. You said that to him? Well, yeah, we were talking about like we both love candy. It's like not like I'm living with the straight and narrow all the time. Right, right. It's like I should be, I should be closer to what he looks like. How often do you exercising? Um, basketball. Once a week. That's it. That's about it. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:12:37       You don't long to do anything more than that and that you don't get driven like you were doing. No, that's not true. Yeah. No, I go up and and going up to Runyon Canyon a lot. Oh yeah. Hiking. Yeah. That's legit. It's just gone for the last week. People make fun of hiking like Ooh was fucking basically you're doing like leg lifts, a little body weight squats over and over and over again going up hills. It's fucking Rad in this, in the winter time like this where you can, you can really see like for me, you get up there on the left hand one you're going to see like all of the ocean and stuff and the whole city spread out before you. Yeah. Yeah. Hiking is fun, man. I think is really fun. It's fun to just to get out there and get away from buildings. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:13:15       There's something cool about being in the woods now. It's almost like I'm looking at it like, man, you mother fuckers aren't going to be around here for much longer. What do you mean by the woods? Oh yeah. Like there. They appreciate them while you can, until the whole thing becomes like blade runner. It'll all be chopped down at some point. Right. We need what for everybody? I don't know how long it takes to grow a tree, so long. Long time. Well, that's another thing that hemp can do. You can make buildings and the trees that are stronger than building's made out of wood. What really? Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. It's a nutty plan. It's really light, but it's super strong. Like the stalk of hemp, like the, the, uh, the actual stock of the tree gets really thick and it's really, it's a bizarre plant.

Speaker 2:          00:13:52       It's almost like an alien. He take this fucking thing. It's super light, but it's really strong fibers wrapped around each other and stuff until it like, well, it's just, it's a stock like any other trial, but it's just a really rare type of fiber and that's why it's makes amazing clothes and that's why it's so good to make paper out of. But you can make a plywood out of it too. They take that shit and they, uh, where did they get on with houses out of it? How do they, uh, do they get involved with hippies? What did that match up? The whole marijuana thing. Plus hippies want to be close to the earth and it seems like earthy to be wearing some sort of truth as opposed to will be as opposed to wearing cotton, which is also pretty fucking earthy, right? Yeah. It's a fucking dipping.

Speaker 2:          00:14:34       It's another plant. It's like discriminating against certain plans at the same shit was way more comfortable when it's way better for your underwears. Yo, if you weren't hamp underwear, I've, chances are you're going to get some chafing and going to get some, uh, some devaluing and you junk if you ever have a underwear on. And then it just, your stuff hangs a little weird. So it's just like rubs up and down against it and you're like, yeah, you get that weird. Yeah, the Dick holds and rang as fuck too, man. That's stupid Dick Hole. And it rips. Do you ever have one that rips like cold dry humping and the child giving birth? Do you use it? I try not to. It hurts. When PMAL do you reach in and grab your Dick and pull it through the hole? What? Yeah. No one does, right? Or does it pull it through the hole?

Speaker 2:          00:15:22       Pull what through the hole. It's in your mouth. No, no, no. So the hole in your underwear, you know, there's always that pull through that whole weird house. Oh, you meant he thought through the bottom, like where your leg is, how you were saying pull some sort of skin out of your Dick Hole. This is how confusing you, you fuck just you talking through ours, your fair? He couldn't understand my quite rational question. Yeah, totally normal. Yeah. I pull out through it called Sometimes I had to pee and stuff. Really? And then it goes back at, Yeah, just to pee at urinals. I don't want to do under the whole thing. Wow. Am The unbuttoned the fucking belt. And what if that hangs down? Like ring around the Rosie or whatever it's called from just staining of peeing all night? No one around the whole, yeah. You would think that that wouldn't be like this is what it off afterwards but off.

Speaker 2:          00:16:09       It's either go back through the middle or let them let it come over and make it a fishing line. Not back through the middle. We're back to the underwear wrapped in teaching you how to Bait your hook back through the middle. I don't, I don't, I don't need that whole, that whole is not important. I want to, I pull my fucking underwear down like a real man. But then here's the problem though, and if you pull that down, the elastic pushes it up against your, you're on your ball, tuck it under your belt, but then when you pee, I feel like some of it's being pinched off. And then when you pull it back over, but you know what I do is Kinda rerelease these two fingers right here. This one comes down and it pushes the elastic away from my boss. Isn't that amazing?

Speaker 2:          00:16:56       All my Dick with one hand and the other hand, I'm just holding my elastic away from my boss. It's not that different. Okay. But wait, how do you shake hands and make friends? Then I put the other people well while I'm in the toilet at the urinals. Yeah. Well I don't really miss shake hands and make friends with the urinal, Ari Shit. That's what I wasn't understanding. How weird was it when that congressman or senator, whoever the fuck he was got busted. I think about bandwidth, low problems. So if you're using any bandwidth here at the studio, let me shut this shit up. That shit off. I'll shut it all off. Um, the, um, the, what's his name? Larry Craig because that was his name was the congressman and he went, he went to, yeah, a truck stop while he was in a bathroom at an airport. Oh, airport bathroom was an airport bathroom that they had been having problems and complaints with like these, these really aggressive gay guys had set up shop and this one bathroom, this one airport.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       And they had like, they had meetings there and they would have these little like signals they would do to let other guys and other stalls. No, they're ready to fuck. Okay. And, and the word got out, the word got out. Well this guy, uh, his name is, uh, he's Larry cubs a photo. Do you have to, how do you get up there? This is all post nine 11. Yeah. Is it the outside toilets like with a check? Bags are, I don't know where it is. You know, I don't, I don't know. Um, it couldn't be through security then. No Way. They're buy tickets somewhere. They're just not getting on a plane. Yeah. Or is it known if you've got to lay over at lax? It might be one of those things. So it might be one of those things where guys go there on purpose just to hook up. Like they take like fake trips.

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       There's no number dude. Just go in there and, well, and then people, so then what happened was cops, I believe this is how the story works. People are getting complaints. So cops decided they were going to go undercover. So they went under cover and this guy, uh, who would turn out to be a senator got arrested for doing it, trying to get his freak on. And he claimed that, uh, he was trying to, what is it that somebody tapped his shoe? No, he was saying he had a wide stance or something like that. Yeah, I know. And that's why he's a, his legs went under the other guy's stall because that was the sign. You'll put your legs up, you tap the other guy's foot. And that was a sign. What? It must have been so fun for them before someone had to come in and start hating.

Speaker 1:          00:19:22       Imagine you're a senator, you're talking about how much you hate gay people and you're talking about gay people shouldn't be allowed to get married and then you go to a bathroom and just some you smell shit. Why some guys suck in your cock and like Yay Dude, you just go to this fun for them at Chicago, not midway, not O'Hare and you just go there and some guy he'll fuck you. It's probably some sort of form of mental disease or disorder that someone like that has, well the gun but a guy who's like an anti gay, right, right. That turns out to be secretly engaging in gay activities. It's gotta be compensation. Right. Just like keeping a public eye public persona of like going overboard to try to defend against what you are. Yeah. A lot of it is that, and you know a lot of it is they're trying to convince themselves that they can control this demon urge inside my loins.

Speaker 1:          00:20:15       We did it. We did open mics when I started opening my ex, but there was this guy who none of us want it good, but he, he did this like self hating gay routine, but it was like real. Was he a self hating Gig? He was like, do you know what it's like to know I'm evil to know what I'm wanting is tied to me is wrong. It was sort of funny, but it was like, oh my God. The older I get, the more I think that gay people have it. Right? What gay people seeing me? No, not that that too, but also that they're hanging out with other guys. They get to fuck and hang out with

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       guys. You know, dude, I walked down Santa Monica Boulevard one day when it's nice out, I'll take a walk around my neighborhood and you just see them on their patio like bars, eating chicken wings and enjoying themselves and their company. They're all smiling, they're all smiling. They're not dealing with women. There's never that exasperated like what? What are they even talking about? By the way, cool women in the world. We're not talking about you. All right. Relax. Talking about nightmares. I had a friend today describe me, his, his nightmare scenario. What was it? I can't talk about it on the air, but it was, it was so preposterous. If somebody who was really happening to like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just nonsense fights. And I was like, whew, you have to break up with this crazy person. I was in a urinal last night,

Speaker 6:          00:21:34       uh, at the Improv and when I walked in, the one that only a urinal that was open was right next to the stall and there was a guy sitting on the, you know, when you could just tell somebody sitting on the toilet. And I was thinking about that story about the guy that like under the foot under thing. I'm like, I'm just thinking like, oh I hope he doesn't grab my foot cause I don't want anything to do with, I don't know. I was really stoned and I'm like, oh that's what briefcases are forced. He could just like set it down, you know, like a blocker. Keep somebody from flip tapping you invented. I bet.

Speaker 2:          00:22:04       I mean, what a terrible place to meet to fuck where people, Shit. So the opposite of romance. It's just public bathroom, bath at an airport, be an extra dirty. Is that what it is? Is there something about being an extra dirty boy or do you like it dirty, like revving the shit out of a stranger? Some girls like that too. Look like, oh this is what we're doing right now, but at least like it's a guy and a girl are doing like vaginal penis sex. If a guy and a guy and a shithouse like they might be fucking each other in the butt. And that's what I'm wondering. I'm like how much butt fucking is going on where people shit. Oh like that is because then the problem would be like, wait, am I smelling your ass right now or are you like someone else's?

Speaker 2:          00:22:50       If you two guys were but fucking and there was, you know, just shit all over the place and you smelled the ship getting like pumped into the air as this guy was slamming in this guys. But I mean look, dudes are sick fucks. Okay. There's definitely some dudes who have fucked some dudes with a shitty, but there's no doubt about it. It's not like every gay guy, this Evergage Nagin the button, make the shitty smell come out more. I would in my dream and my dream, you probably start getting the like it because it's like your, your lover's smell and then you let you start. Joey Diaz used to have a bit above that about art and in front of gay guys to turn them off at the gym. He's doing yoga. You release it to let him know. It's like, Ooh, who's that? Yeah, show ideas.

Speaker 2:          00:23:33       Yeah. Yeah. Would have to smell like that and then you have to smell other people's shit. It just seems like a really terrible place to try to get a hard on. Justin. Justin, can you imagine if someone gave you, like if you had like a a prize, $100 who could go into the bathroom and do a shitty bathroom and master bay to climax first? I think it's the same species that hangout at like men's locker rooms, athletic clubs, and they just kind of hang out there and talk and like say should have that wish somebody at some point concept. Am I going to find someone shitting? Go on either side of them and then just ready, go and then just go in there and try to jerk off. God. Could you imagine if he did it publicly? Liked her? I think he got to go on a stall because if you do it like in front of people, like in the bed, like if you're in the bathroom, like the urinals, like if you like having, absolutely no, that'd be, that'd be weird to them.

Speaker 2:          00:24:27       Fucked up man. If I do just start beating off in a urinal. I did that once in a church. Watts was delivering flowers. You went to a church to deliver flowers beat off in the year and I need to go to the bathroom and I was like, this seems like the perfect wrong place to do this. Wow. That's hilarious. How old are you? 16 okay, so this was before you got super religious? No, I was religious center before I went back to go to Israel. Here's, were you in Israel? That was right after I got back from Israel. That was right after he got back. I got back from Israel. Oh, so when you got back you probably will like over it. I didn't start. No, not yet. I was still took me like a couple months to talk to start really realizing those thoughts were coming up.

Speaker 2:          00:25:09       Oh. But obviously wanted to left the fucking repertoire. That's data is religious like God, I never worked its way out. Was it a Christian Church? Uh, yeah. Was there a little hate fucking going on that year at all? Is there a little of that? Like a little, a little better with the Jews are better. Jews were not. Come on your Christian Church churches urinal. There's on university drive. My crazy shit is better than your crazy shit. I used to try to jerk off whenever the planes, they don't say this anymore, but they used to say that, uh, we're now going over Arkansas. If you look out your window, they ever do that anymore. Yeah. Sometimes they do that still. If it would get really chatty pilot, I would get up and I would go. I was like, oh, Arkansas. I go run to the bathroom and tried to cross Arkansas off my list.

Speaker 2:          00:25:54       That's hilarious. As you're in the sky, does that count of saying like you had sex in Arkansas short the list or is it a masturbation list? It was just like I where I dropped off. That's probably free. People think you have to be on the ground, man. I have to be real and I was never going to get to these places. International Air. Yeah. Yeah. Account. You wouldn't get to Arkansas. I bet you have a good fucking time in Arkansas. Clinton was the Goddamn Gun, man. I Bet Clinton just, I have a feeling that he probably had some good influence on little rock. I bet if she went there, it's probably a little rock schools anywhere. This is a college pretty nice. Cool. Yeah. I mean if a guy like Clinton became the governor, well he's such a bad motherfucker though. He's such a good talker. There are still girls that would fuck him. Like a lot of them. I hope they still do. Girls that weren't when he was a president. I hope there's girls today that give him a little on the sneak tip. That's what I hope and they just know how to keep their mouth shut. He's the Goddamn president and have some respect. One of the greatest presidents of all time, let them jerk off.

Speaker 2:          00:27:00       I remember the lady, I remember being so relieved when he got caught. Why? Because I didn't feel like I was fucked up. I was like, I felt like I always felt like all throughout my life like that I was way too horny. Like what's wrong with me? Like why do I want sex all the time? Like you know what, what? And when I was younger it was like, why can't I stay in a relationship? I just so fucking bored. I would just want to go [inaudible] whatever it is. Doing well, yeah, whatever it was. But I'd always also felt like, man, I'm just like a creepy person. Like I'm a creepy person. Like to have these feelings and then Clinton, God, God getting his is sacked by a 20 year old and it was all over TV. And I'll never forget that. Never forget that feeling.

Speaker 2:          00:27:49       I was like, I'm okay. I'm okay. We're men are crazy. Like so whenever like anything nutty comes up in the media about any guy doing some crazy shit. You're like, I know they're out there. I know they are. They have to be a, why wouldn't it be the same percentage of politicians when all these reverence guys, things come out and they see the John Travolta, you know, tries to fuck on one. He gives me massages. Of course he does. What do you mean? Did you hear about the lawsuit? One of the guys is suing John Travolta now, so like I never promised that it wasn't going to tell anybody. Oh, he's suing John Travolta. John Travolta. Because I guess for slander or something, I don't even know. Like the John Travolta said he didn't do it. And I think what it was so many questions, John Travolta guns, like sick as lawyers on people.

Speaker 2:          00:28:38       I'm probably offered them some good deals to shut the fuck up some money, man, you know, and so then they dropped the cases or the cases where, or maybe he paid them off ahead of time. Just so head on Tony Buddy. Legally binding. I'll just tell, tell people you tried to touch my job. That would be devastating if they did that. I think he's, he's definitely a gay, right? Gay. Why is that offensive? I don't know. Someone who's PC would totally call you on that. You know it's also bad. A black, oh, that's way worse. Way Worse than blacks. Even at this ain't a game. A black. You're a black. Wow. Travolta facing new lawsuit over gay sex scandals. Slam for Rehab. Rehab Desk. Does he murdering people but not really? Loves it. Very good. Rehab Desk. How is that possible? I don't know. Let's see. What can not to do as a coach. How killings connected to like something where someone got murdered? Is that what it's saying? This is the former pilot. I remember that guy. That picture of him kissing a pilot a long time ago. It's just the former pilot claims he carried on a six

Speaker 7:          00:29:41       year relationship with John Travolta is towing all 62 year old dog. Go God Berta whoa claims that he met Travolta Volta in February of 1981 when the actor interviewed him for a pilot job and it didn't seem became lovers. John. Well, hold on, hold on right there. Hold on. It says John Travolta often like to eat the man's asshole. Oh, Fox says silly man. It's assholes too much. You'd have to say the clinical term, but wait. Alleged lover reveals secrets of six year relationship. Oh, he's not suing him. Hey everybody. I'm Stephanie Bower, Holly's school pilot who claims he carried on a six year relationship with John Travolta is telling all 62 year old. Doug got her ball claim in February of 1981 when the actor interviewed him for a job and they soon became lovers. The man makes the wild claims in a story to the national enquirer from their first date.

Speaker 7:          00:30:39       Got Her boss says they became a couple and travel to whisk him away whenever he wanted. The last time he saw her was in 1992 by that time, the Hollywood actor had married Kelly Preston, but he says to roll to told him he's still preferred men to both his team and the scandals surrounding him lately. And this man's story seems pretty sensational for more entertainment news checkout, Holly Scoop. Wait, why does that even seem sensational? Oh, because that's what they told him to say. Yeah, but because before he met his wife, he had a relationship with another person. Yeah, that's what they told her to say. So she said it. Yeah, that's, that's fine. That's not professional at all. That's not news. Just cause he won't say he likes to do dude. Sometimes he just doesn't want to say because it's bad for his career. Hit the latest updates as John Travolta.

Speaker 7:          00:31:27       This attorney cause this lawsuit. Right. Dickie less. Wait, why is there a loss? Why is it guys suing him? What lawsuit? That's just the book. He's just saying he had oh relationship. You can't sue him for that. I think that was just the wrong link. If you worked for John Travolta for like six years, would you troll and just say that he fucked to fuck me [inaudible] software? He probably would fuck you though. It depends what kind of situation I'm at. Probably would try to fuck you. At least John John hear it. They don't like you repulsive. John Travolta is, uh, is being accused of not asking someone to keep quiet. The savages star has been sued by a pilot and gave an interview to the national choir in August. Uh, he claimed he had a romantic relationship, blah, blah, blah. Doug says he filed the suit for relief and response to what he says is threatening letter from your voltage attorney reminding him that he signed a confidante confidentiality agreement upon leaving triple his employee. Meanwhile got the dirt [inaudible] him to see he signed a termination agreement but never agreed to keep quiet. So whatever. I mean, even if he did sign it, he probably would want to release it anyway. If he's trying to fuck with Travolta Travolta, cut it off when he started getting old. That's fly together that don't do the obvious gables. Hey, do you

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       know like if you were to have gay affairs in the sky is the best way to make sure no one knows? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:32:46       maybe that's why I tried a pilot. Maybe that's why it's your role to me, Kayla, and then it was too embarrassed about it because like, no, I'm not gay. They can just shove them out the fucking window. No foul feed it. Could you imagine if that's what he was doing? She just have a gay discos and space. Just the inside of his thing. It was all like one of those Dexter cut houses have an all in one stick all over the walls. Could have an all in one button autopilot and disco ball or just come down. It comes down like instead of oxygen masks just go, ball comes down, fleets starts spinning and John Travolta comes out to stay alive and as long as it were pointing at his boner,

Speaker 2:          00:33:40       he was a bad ass dancer. That should have been, that should have been thing number one. It was amazing. And look who's talking to. Nah, I'm really, it wasn't that impressive. Performance friction was great. That's when he came back. Isn't it amazing that one movie just all of a sudden you're a bad ass again? Cool enough movie? Yeah. It's all it takes. For some people you don't need a lot of creditors or some people just one. That's a weird thing. When the stars just sort of fall off and they can't do movies anymore because their name or their brand has been, that's got to suck, man. Dan has gotta be a tough fucking slung to handle. I mean, it's not the worst thing in the world. Don't get me wrong. [inaudible] Joe, fuck what's going on in Syria? He's poor attitudes, man. They don't really work as much anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:34:25       You see that 30 for 30 and the Brook football players, not what was broke athletes, how most football players are broke two years after that of the league. Yeah. I think there's domestic was percent of NFL players. Within two years we're bankrupt and 60% of NBA players, 60% they need to do a better job of actually hand those people, but whatever. Well, there's also, there's the culture of trying to keep up with the Joneses, which is extremely strong with successful athletes and successful entertainers. Lamar Odom on the credential and show fucking mansions. Yeah. Well, when you see people with a fucking Bentley, you want to, you know, you want to let everybody know you arrived. Just the loopers. We're just trying to get a job. It's like you're making 400 grand a year that that's really good, but that's just heavy doctor money. This is jus talk right here. This is like, you know, this is how pro pro athletes don't think like that. That's how they became pro athletes. They're wild, crazy. Motherfuckers don't, how can you make it rain and it's strip club. That's just such a waste because you can only, because at that moment you can and when they can, they feel like they're the fucking man and it's a rush. It's a rush. It's just sitting with fake money. Ari.

Speaker 4:          00:35:35       Oh yeah. I forgot like playing monopoly money in the middle there

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       like right here. And it's like this all fall and weird. You know what else is weird? The diamonds that wearing all those diamonds. That's kind of crazy too. I remember some Kuleana or something like, or old dirty bastard. One of those guys once said he wants to have a, or maybe snoop dog, whatever. You know my point is he said he wants to have a phone made entirely out of diamonds and just the insides would be, the problem is those things are, you know, they fucking phone is only good for six, seven months and then you're going to want the newest shit and yours is going to be out of diamonds completely out of date. Like those virtue phones. Have you ever seen those? What are those? Um, who makes that? Brian, do you know who makes the virtue phone? I think the guts of it are that a new voice?

Speaker 3:          00:36:24       What was that? Oh, there is rip torn son. Yeah. It's called a [inaudible] and they're stupid expensive man. Things are, you know, it'd be out of date and like here's one and $9,000 for a cell phone. Yes. Yes. It's ridiculous. And by the way, it's got a little shitty ass stupid screen. It's got, but, and why is it 9,000? Because it's made out of like really expensive shit. What's the name of it? It's called a [inaudible] v. E. R. T. U. It's like one of the dumbest luxury items in quotes that, that people choose to indulge in. But it comes with like executive services too. Like there's a virtue concierge, so like you call and they get you a reservations in restaurants and shit like that. Just sit right here. So I guess it's like, yeah, that's it. So I guess there's like probably some, uh, some benefit in that integrated with those voices. Son of a stuck in that voice. Hey, where's the ball? Yeah, signature zirconium. They make them with like good, bad gay boy fucking bad version of a bad gay boy. And you know what I'm doing anymore? This episode is brought to you by the Skywalker. Oh, Shit. Got, we've got way too high before the show folks. I'm really sorry. We're, we're looking up luxury phones now. Despite all though. No, no, no, no, no. Like luxury.

Speaker 3:          00:37:55       I don't own any diamonds. Try to hear what that the diamond things is really weird thing when he's had those crazy chains that they were on the neck. What do you mean? It's like the diamonds. Hundreds of thousands of dollars on their neck that's just showing it's peacocking just showing off your others showing that you can do that. Well, if you could walk around with a house on your neck, that dude is letting you know he's a bad motherfucker. But a lot of those guys, that's why they wind up going like off the deep end really quickly. It's real similar to this. Um, um, perennial. A potluck comedian of my community named house head, whereas a doll's house around his head. How's head? Yeah. Well he's like carrot top. Okay. They got that.

Speaker 4:          00:38:37       I was thinking of going red. I could have been carried top. What else? What else? What else? What else? How sad this is it. I got it. I fucking got it. He's like a semi homeless. Oh God. Where's the doll house? And I said I'm going to be a pertinent face apartment. That's the one up them. Eventually someone had to say those words. Apartment face. You can probably, they've been said before but not probably the his house face. We're just draws like look like Steve's these two going to look like apartments down inside. People going around your chest hair.

Speaker 3:          00:39:16       You were the one who said that a apartments in downtown La seems too scary.

Speaker 6:          00:39:22       Well yeah, I mean little shits box. It's really sweet. Like there's really amazing like Batman style restaurants and you walk in and everyone's like, really? Class seem cool. Wow this is really cool. But then you walk like the wrong way to your car and it's like you're dead man. You're like, there's like just, it's scary. Like fucking like so many homeless people and sketchy people and people aren't drug.

Speaker 4:          00:39:42       I've never had anything happen or heard anything happened, but I get nervous every time I'm there. Yeah. People screaming at you like, Hey, you're like,

Speaker 6:          00:39:53       especially when you're like, I was walking, I think I told you this on podcast. So once when I was walking like Veronica Richie and imagine walking with her through this maze of probably maybe 30 or 40 people in one block, all just

Speaker 4:          00:40:06       you're like, wow, it's kind of like a walking dead. You have to shovel a bunch of change down the street and run when they all go for it. Yeah. People don't realize we're not exaggerating. It's really sounds like you're exaggerating but there's spots this it sounds like

Speaker 3:          00:40:26       total horse was like the are bigger than up. I'm telling you there are spots of downtown la like nowhere else in the world. They literally are like a Zombie movie, but daytime that places alive and fun. They have, they have homeless villages, like the entire street is nothing but cardboard box shelters and homeless. The homeless community, like they've jelled together in a homeless community like no place else in America. There's no place else in America like skid row,

Speaker 6:          00:40:52       you know, street cleaning day. It's actually just a bath or a shower for homeless people.

Speaker 4:          00:40:57       That's the lay down and that's going to be taking off my clothes, treats, sweeping day shiny on one side. Or if you get it wrong, not

Speaker 3:          00:41:12       cleaning dates, just sweeping thing. And you just get fucked up on that brush. There's so many of them. It's hard to wrap your head around when you see it all. Did you ever see them, Kevin? You can't think about it. I'll think about it. It's too overwhelmingly horrible. What's homeboy's name? I'm sorry. Mac. Lindsey [inaudible] you, did you ever see the Mac Lindsey

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       footage where Mack went undercover in skid row? No. Oh my God. Really? He did it for Kevin boots. Movie American drug war. He went undercover, I believe. I believe it was for that document as a fucking homeless person. Masterpass pass. Well, I was a little dirtier, I think. Uh, yeah, he, uh, I mean he's fucking fearless for doing that man because he was out with those people. Always hug. Boom. Shaka Laka we trade shirts with them sometimes. He's a good dude, man. Good Dude. He's got some love for people, but his, uh, that, that adventure was really weird to watch. Like that he had night vision on his camera and he's like lying in this like sort of sleeping bag type thing. Watching all these people and filming though and the street, it's fucking crazy. I might be wrong about the sleeping bag type thing. He was like sleeping.

Speaker 1:          00:42:25       It was amongst, covered up somehow he was like, you know, wrapped up and he was laying amongst them. He was like living amongst them. Like Jane Goodall. Not quite like gorillas in the mist that did more dangerous than the chimps. Oh yeah. Literally push people on fucking subway trains. Yeah. Just see that shit. That's the scariest thing about those, those things. Whatever. Brazil is the same thing. It's just sort of foreign environment. Yeah. Just feel like someone could shove me into the highway. Yeah. Or someone could shut me out of the tracks of crazy things have happened. They don't happen that often. They happen. Yeah. Like this guy that did this in New York. I mean, how often is this happening? There's nothing to lose once every few years or something like that. Some nut ball goes crazy and if you think about how many people are passing through the subway system in New York every day, the numbers are really, really tiny.

Speaker 1:          00:43:08       It's really relatively, it's very safe. But for that one guy wasn't fish. Yeah, I, that picture was horrific. Horrific. It's a terrible way to die, man. So what happened? They catch the homeless guy. Did they lock him up? But he said somebody sent him, he said they passed him at the home as he was leaving the platform. It's everyone's running towards the guy and tried to help him and he said the homeless guy, which was muttering like God damn mother Fucker, Whoa. Like, like norm wars for just like that third, their schizophrenia. They're just crazy out there. Yeah, there's a lot of that man. There's a lot of that. Are we reclaiming homeless people? Are we getting them back? Nope. Normal or do they just die out occasionally. Yeah. There's some stories about dudes who were homeless who a figure figure their way back to a good job, or somebody hooks him up, he should go to apartment face.

Speaker 1:          00:43:53       It's just hell. They just checking out at apartment this. Yeah. There's some people bounce back from that, but man, it's hard. It just can't operate with society. They're just like, they're going to go with the opposite way. Some of them is that, some of them, a lot of them is drugs. Oh yeah. Burned them out. Well, they just get hooked to, yeah, and the the throw all their money and they get crazy and they don't know what to do. They have no control anymore. That's a lot of people that are in dire straights. Yeah, big amount. You know, I mean there's, there's homeless people because of the economy. There's homeless people because of, you know, financial difficulty and then there's homeless people that are just out of their fucking heads and this homeless people that are just, they just can't stop doing drugs. There's, there's a whole

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       variety of reasons why people are homeless, but the, the type that you see in skid row or very specific. What I mean those are the drugs zombies. They're drugs on me cause that's what the try so wait. So then, then the drug deals have to come down there. We watched him smoke crack while we're filming. Fear factor once. Really? Yeah. It was [inaudible] me and the contestants were in downtown La and we're in one of those man carriers. You know what? Those baskets that they put on cranes to lift you up slowly. The one that Travolta always uses, he uses that in a man basket. You won't let it go. You're fucked three calls, but you're just waiting for that one. Good one. I know all the, all those homeless vaginas feel the same. Anyway, the man basket, we're, we're up in this thing and we're like, we're like above like the second floor looking down and watching people smoked crack realize right there on the street in the middle of downtown La. That's such a hard drug.

Speaker 2:          00:45:23       Just smoking. It has like when you get bad, like who's nervous to smoke pot? I don't think that's happening. Well I guess it's just when you're around a bunch of other people that do it, so then it Buckhead was like the normal shit. I saw it in Winnipeg when we were in Winnipeg in 2010 yeah. I walked walking down the river because it was summertime. Yeah, so beautiful. When you smell this like candy, it smells like candy smell sweet. That's a path for patch and I always say it smells like candy when you burn it. Whoa. Who said that? My friend Patrick. Oh, you did an accent has Canadian weirdly Kaden and he did a lot of coke or alleged. You're just around it and then it couldn't believe what it smelled like. Yeah. You see it and you're like, oh my God, that's the a bunch of homeless people don't crack.

Speaker 2:          00:46:04       It's a crazy thing to try. Well it's like there's no good reports coming back like this. You got to have that. It's real. It works out really well for one person is trying to convince someone. I'm telling you, man, crack has got a band name. I know, but if it was telling you, I know a part of me would be the desire if it was around other people were doing it and go like, yeah, a lot of successful motherfuckers on crack. They just keep it a secret. I'm telling you crack is whack guys. That's a lot of people say that it didn't quit Whitney and say that crack is whack. It's one of the things she said that made me believe she was on crack. I know, right? It's like saying we'd wheat speed or wheat as he'd Paula Abdul. She didn't know he needed one of those words work.

Speaker 2:          00:46:47       Hey, all right. I found out that your name means lion. Yeah. I would have just told you that you could. You should have told me a long time ago. I didn't know. That's something you should tell me. Which part? Ari Shaffir. Ari. Ari Means Lion, powerful and me and Joe and me and Jodie Leo's. And I think that's why we get together. So, aw, you should deep. You're amazing. You should write birthday cards for chicks. Chicks with head injuries, teardrop on each one. Hearing the water color, the flower crown that folks took growed Grote and my mom, my mom just got internet today, like high speed Internet for the first time, and it was so real broad band from a, uh,

Speaker 7:          00:47:29       I'm really scared now you're talking to her about the McAfee thing. And then I just stupidly said, Oh yeah, we talked to him on the podcast and then she goes, Oh, you did? I'm like, Oh fuck. What did I just talk to on the podcast? You had them called in. Hell yeah, man, it's good. I saw you had that. I was like, wait, is that the same guy while he's in hiding?

Speaker 1:          00:47:48       Uh, yeah, that's the same guy. Wow. Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 7:          00:47:52       And it's being shipped back. They're going to ship them back. They said, I'm so done with that. You don't think so? You think it's the whole aspect of the whole thing. It's horrible. It's all right. It's possible. You always have the fucking fake radars. And I feel like lonely girl, 18 or 51 attention, like I'll make up a story something. So it was like some, oh whatever. I don't care anymore. It's like the, nevermind you and I was to give you a reference. You guys would be like, what the fuck are you talking about? The Phantom, I don't know if you guys remember the phantom that was supposed to be this video game system that would, uh, you just like plug in to your TV and it would just have every single computer video game. I remember that. What happened? It was just that one of those projects where they raised a bunch of money and then we took a bunch of money.

Speaker 7:          00:48:30       Yeah. So it seems like that if I have that same feeling with this whole thing. Oh yeah. Plus he loves playing pranks. Right? That guy, they said he like really loves pranking. It's just too much fucking and the, and the believes again, government with whatever he's leaving from. They are on the record saying we don't even, we're not even arresting him. We just want to question him. Yeah. Like where he's not even under arrest. We're not going to let me go through the plane. We're not going to wait for him. We're just going to get them eventually in question,

Speaker 1:          00:48:54       right?

Speaker 7:          00:48:56       Yeah. I think they're going to kill him. Just being on say, I was like, we won't pay the bribes. What? Why don't you just then pay the bribes? I think they'll just think there's too much attention to it. I think they put him in jail with somebody who beats the shit out of him. Oh Man. But he's also blogging from jail. So the whole thing just makes me feel now he's in holding in the other country matter. How many times do you get to blog or hey, you're my space and this holding cell guys. So if anyone had Wifi, like a universal fucking airport in his phone and it would be that guy. Right? If it's, if he's telling the truth, he's incredible. Really scary man. So, but he ran away from America because of what little lower taxes. That's not running away. That's fair.

Speaker 1:          00:49:35       That's not like no disgrace. No, he didn't run away for taxes.

Speaker 7:          00:49:38       Really. I thought it said he ran, he like got murder. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He left America for no, no, no murder.

Speaker 1:          00:49:45       No, he, he, no, not, it wasn't that it was that he was involved in a business that was a, they were trying to make a sport, uh, these low flying aerial crafts. They're like, it looks like a kite with a motorcycle attached to it. And these people crashed and died and uh, he was somehow or another connected, even though he wasn't flying those vehicles, he was trying to promote the sport. So he got sued by a family. So what he decided to do apparently was to just get the fuck.

Speaker 7:          00:50:13       Doesn't that seem kind of weird though, if you really, because if you were in that situation, you could probably be just like, hey, no, you shouldn't be held accountable for the murder you've helped or didn't do well. I would like to, I would leave. You would just leave the contract. I'm not to kill anybody. May have been negligent. I'm sorry, but I'm fucking doing 30 years for this. If I ever went to to get rid of you. I just like see here. No, I don't have the money to just fucking them up and relocate all of a sudden. But if I did I'd be like, let's just call it. Other countries are cool too.

Speaker 3:          00:50:41       Yeah. I don't know if it would've picked believes. Yeah, I think he just figured he'd be able to like buy a safety net to be able to live their army. These people keep them working for you. Keep a bunch of dogs around and just live like a pimp.

Speaker 7:          00:50:55       I think he seems to be more until they turn their guns around. He's probably more gangster than we think he is. Yeah. And now he's after me cause he's after you and he's like, I'm adding Brian to the list. He was like, I'm gonna catch you. I'm going to get you. He said something like that in the interview. It freaked me. You have a Skype in or call in patch to throw it through a video of them?

Speaker 8:          00:51:17       No.

Speaker 7:          00:51:19       While you're looking at him, I'm looking at you. Oh, on the screen, they look like you're looking at Rogen to say like, what can you say? I don't know that you have that same look that the guy behind the bar, the Tempe Improv used to have. When you ask her a beer, they would look over your shoulder until it left the manager. Like, who the fuck are you looking at? Give me a beer. What are you talking about?

Speaker 3:          00:51:39       Okay. Yeah. Where'd you go? I just watched you guys spiral into it. I tried to figure out what the fuck you were going with this nonsense and just thought about running out of the room. Um, anyway. Homeboys, uh, in trouble or they might bring them back to Billy's talking about senator this going for it. I hope everything turns out to be perfectly fine, but there's just too much crazy shit and, and if you pay attention to it, it drives you crazy and I don't feel like they following it anymore. So that's fair. Well, the dude is like, I mean, he's a crazy fucking guy regardless of whether or not he's guilty. He's a fascinating dude. Just by fact that he's made, is willing to leave society and go down there to believe and live on the beach. And this essentially what he calls a pirate island.

Speaker 3:          00:52:35       He said it was founded by pirates. He was explaining it to us like the, they've always been sort of corrupt down there and he goes, they rely on their tourism. That's where he was hoping he could make a dent. Oh Man. Cool. Yeah, I think he was thinking that he would be able to make such a big stink that they would realize that he has some power with the media and you know that he has a profile image or he was always talking about moving or Columbia. Right. Um, he definitely thought to Costa Rica. I think a lot of people who make money have thought about pulling all their money out and going somewhere. I live in like where the dollar is strong or something where it's a lot longer dollars strong and the laws are different. You Fuck 16 year olds and that kind of shit. I mean this dude is 50 it was 67. He's got a 20 year old girlfriend.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       Mcafee. How old is Sean Penn? I Dunno. He's dating a girlfriend. Florence and the machine. Who's that? She's the girl from Florence and the machine. Florence. What is, what does Florence and it's a band. It's like a really popular band. It's redhead girl from England, just like 26. She's 26. She's taking Sean Penn. Tom Pen. So what, I'm just wondering, I think it's amazing. I think uh, Sean Penn is probably 50. [inaudible] maybe least. Right? Why do you care how old he is and how old she is though? Looking at what's possible. Yeah. Is that what it is? You look at it? Yes. I can pull this off. I was like, wow. Just an admiration. I had a conversation with a friend of ours that will remain nameless and he was talking about it as he's getting older. He's 50 now and uh, he was talking about young girls that the girls, he dates all seem to stay around the same age. That's a, that's um, what's it called? That's a, what's that movie with a paddle around? Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:54:19       No, the paddles. They paddle the new graduates at 18. What movies, Huh? Boy? 17. Oh, I didn't see that. I don't think there's a confused the older, the more they stay the same age as the Matthew mcconaughey. Well that is a lot of guys, man, they get stuck in that one emotional level. No, I like Hasko girls, something like that. He was a, a dude

Speaker 1:          00:54:40       did I used to be friends with back in the day who uh, he broke it down like in a really fucked up way. He's like, ah. The problem with women that are older is they know their value. That's the problem. He goes when they're young and they're like 20, 21 he goes, they don't know like how valuable being hottest. So you can get like one sort of way harder than you're supposed to be able to get. And I was like listening to him say that. So I was like, this is a guy that's like for him it's like the stock market. Like, you know, he was, he had like figured out some sort of a crack in the system and like, so he goes, when I see a girl, he was just like 25, 26 I just don't want to have anything.

Speaker 2:          00:55:12       It's too late. 25, 26 it's too much. Yeah. You heard the latest, they're saying now that McAfee has had a heart attack in prison today.

Speaker 1:          00:55:20       Well he didn't say you had a heart attack. He said he had heart pains and so they brought him to the whatever doctor. They have medication. Some dude with a fucking chicken foot. No.

Speaker 2:          00:55:33       So wait, so roles is it, that's a different guy than the one that's in, that's McAfee. Yeah. He's got a 20 year old girlfriend. He said he did stuff, suffers a heart attack. How long ago was that?

Speaker 5:          00:55:42       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:55:45       I got pee. You Go pee. I'll be right back. Don't worry about it. We're right here and taken to the hospital. It's a, it's a fascinating story. The, the, the, what's really fascinating about it is that there's this guy who is this really wealthy man who, uh, has a wild side to him. He's wild man. Just from the whole idea of his airplane sport that he was into. That's pretty wild. But you know, a lot of the people do risky shit and take risky chances, but then his drug forum posts or the nuttiest

Speaker 2:          00:56:20       yeah, that's the shit that, man, I think that kind of stuff throws me off. Makes me to go, I didn't want to

Speaker 6:          00:56:24       fall for this. This is going to be a l l cat at the end or we know it's going to be like, what's that? That shit never going to let you down. Like at the very end, he's kind of just be like, guys, he's going to give a statement to the press and he's going to just play that song and then I'll you dick, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:56:38       Well, McAfee said when we had them on that, all of his talk on that blue, you know, blue light drug post, uh, was all just trolling. Right? But it's not like, it's not much of a troll.

Speaker 5:          00:56:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:55       You know, I mean, when you hear what these, the drug's supposed to do, the drug is supposed to tighten this part right up here. These things are kind of, they're funky. They need to be tightened. Um, when you, when you, when you read the thread and you, you find out like, what is it, let me get off here.

Speaker 5:          00:57:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:17       Anyway, what he knew about it, he knew so much about it. I mean he knew so much about the different ways to cook it and separate the different elements. And the fact that he had, he actually had a lab in his yard and the saying that he was using it to have sex with monkey sex with 17 year old girlfriend and he actually does have a 17 year old girlfriend. I mean the, the fact that the drug taking would really be the least shocking aspect of the story. The most shocking aspect of stories. A 67 year old dude and seven sex with a 17 year old girl in a pirate island. I mean, you know, I mean there are drugs like what? Yeah, of course there's drugs, right? What do you mean? Like drugs got there before he did, but that stuff MDPV is legal, so it's not even like he was doing anything illegal in, in believes it's totally legal there.

Speaker 1:          00:58:14       Oh yes. What's the problem? Well, nothing, there's no problem. They, he, but he doesn't want to admit that he does it or he, you know, or he denies it. Honestly, I mean, I don't know. I'm completely, totally speculating as to whether or not he did it, but the story's way more fun if he did it. If he's out there cooking passed salts and then bang and a 17 year old, that is, that becomes a way better story. And it killed, you think it killed his neighbor? Uh, I have no idea. He says he didn't, he didn't sound like a murderer to me. What do I know? What is the merger? Especially if he's having crazy delusional thoughts. I can see it if he lives like Scarface, I could see him getting pissed at his neighbor was complaining about a dogs. Yeah, there were, there definitely been some reports of him doing nutty shit.

Speaker 1:          00:58:57       Like one guy said he climbed into his balcony and what sleep. He was a woke up, like they woke him up and he was in his own urine. He was lying in a puddle and he was asleep on this guy's balcony and he was claiming that he had jumped over from his balcony and that he was stuck there for hours because the, the federal troops, the state true whenever for the country had arrived. The Billy's police and they were waiting for him and they didn't move and they sat out there and he said, I couldn't move cause I moved. They would kill me. It was the craziest thing. It was so weird. It was really weird. It was talking about how they just stayed there and stared at him for hours and hours and then you look at like what the side effects of MDPV are. We'll make massive hallucis.

Speaker 4:          00:59:41       Oh yeah. It sounds like justifications. Yeah. Just sounds like at the end of the night they just walked away. They just because the sun came up and you realize your mind playing tricks on you. The last time I did mushrooms, we had this fucking crackly tree. It looks so bad ass in front of the moon, but then when the sun comes up you're like, oh, it's just a tree. Yeah. Was just having a loose their shit and I fucking, it could see better. Well that stuff apparently what it sounds like,

Speaker 1:          01:00:04       that stuff apparently it's really bad for that. Especially when you're doing it over the p MDPV. Yeah, and what's the street value of this stuff? I don't think it's that expensive. Really. No. See all this stuff is pretty easy to make. You know, that's, that's where it becomes a problem once you know like the, the, the bath salt, the idea behind it is that it's not a, it's not an illegal drug because it's an illegal drug that's mixed with something else, which changes the classification. So we're not an illegal drug. So all you have to do to be, they sell it and they just say that they're selling it for non human consumption. Oh, that's how, that's how it's bath salts. It says do not consume non human consumption, but everybody knows they're not really bath salts. No. Oh No, no. Everybody knows that it's math and then you get it and you smoke it or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:00:52       I mean you could call whatever, whatever classification. But it apparently out of all these sort of bass salty drugs that they have been selling and experimenting, one of them for awhile was MDPV. It became illegal recently, I believe in America, but it's still legal in beliefs. So what he was doing, if he did have a lab and he was cooking, uh, this stuff up, although he denies it, he went through elaborate posts explaining every single aspect along with photographs of the extraction, the beginning really the middle, how to, and the results, not just how to do it, the results, the images of the results. I mean, what do you mean like taking pictures of the party? He took pictures of all that. No, no, no.

Speaker 4:          01:01:34       And take it, not those results. He took pictures of

Speaker 1:          01:01:40       rob. The problem with the, you know him saying that it was all a troll, was it, this guy is actually taking photographs of it while it's all happening. So maybe he was actually doing something else with, with either a drug or chemical or something which is possible. And he took those photos and was joking around saying, Hey, I'm in my fucking paradise cooking bass salts banging 17 year olds but he is banging the 17 year old and you know, see what I'm saying? It's like it's going on. Yeah. So like the bath salts part is not really that big of an ingredient to the crazy pie. It's not like a third.

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       The bath salts only like 10% it makes it 10% more crazy. You know, it just the fact that he's this genius multimillionaire character who invented McAfee antivirus software, but like yeah, nothing makes him different than like he can fall prey to fucking awesome drugs. Yeah. You know? Well you always got to wonder about it. Like why would I not live his life? I have millions of dollars. Imagine how hard it'd be to date a 17 year old. Like, cause you know, she would flip into that like, oh my God, she's just a child once in a while, like every couple of weeks. How was he didn't date a mega Lamont maniac and a fucking 67 who just thinks he rules the world. You wouldn't want a day to 20 year old. And he definitely wouldn't want to date a 67 year old crazy rich dude. She thinking blush. Oh, she's probably a poor girl that lives on a very poor island.

Speaker 3:          01:03:07       Maybe we should just be into older dudes. Was probably a poor girl. Lived on islands. Get somebody who's 40. Relax. I mean, that's one of the big things with um, uh, the South Pacific, like, uh, a lot of dudes like go down there and get like young wives because those poor girls like a great, they're so happy to get an American to take care of them. Like you can fuck I'm, yeah, this is not really all about like finding something you love and getting married on that, right? No, I know a dude who's in his sixties and he met a girl in the Philippines at fucked her, knocked her up. Oh. And then he goes back and sees his kid every, uh, you know, a few months or so. He flies back to the Philippines, hangs out with her, calls her, his girlfriend. You know what, when he goes, yeah, he's an, he's an older dude.

Speaker 3:          01:03:56       I mean, I think he's, he's probably at least in his sixties and he's got to like, have this weird feeling like he's not going to be around, you know, in 30, 40 years. More than most than likely, you know, who the fuck lives to be a hundred. So it's, how much is it going to get to know his child? So, you know, it's kind of weird because he had girlfriends in America. I had a wife and America and he had kids here, but the, going back there to see his new kid with his really young Filipino girlfriend, it's like, it's really kind of freaky thing for him. You know, like, it's just new thing in this dude's life. He just met her and they did it once while I think he was dating her a little. It was there for a couple of weeks I think for a 60 something year old dude.

Speaker 3:          01:04:36       When you get a little hot young chippy that just, you know these, I don't care if he barely gets to like understand what she's saying. You know you don't carry, she's hugging you and kissing you and you're like really like just the idea of a 20 year old girl or however old this girl is. I don't know how old you can understand that old man who married Anna Nicole Smith. Right. I always understand that. That's why I'm saying that, you know, he was just fucking having a party. He knew what time it is, how you should go out. When I did it, Veronica, I started doing drugs again, like I hadn't done mushrooms and like eight years and I had to relive, you know, her age group of like experimenting with Mushrooms and Ecstasy. I'm like, oh, not this shit again, I'm pretty much back to where I used to.

Speaker 3:          01:05:20       That's actually a really funny man. That's a funny idea. They still enjoy it. It's fun. Different things. Yeah. Will they look forward to doing shit like that? Like Cara who was on yesterday, Cara Santa Maria who was the whatsapp concerts and stuff and like they do things. Yeah. This chick who we had on yesterday, the Huffington Post, science editor, really great, great, great gas. She was awesome. Really interesting, intelligent person. But she was talking about her drug history and it was all like all these experiments when she was young, like over and over this when acid went through, did the acid and went to my friend's wedding. We did this, like all these different things that she did, you know, on all the, all these different drugs. But it's like that was that period of her life and she hasn't done anything in a long time now. Yeah. Like we were just kind of grow out of it.

Speaker 3:          01:06:07       What's that? A lot of people just kind of grow out of it. Yeah. And I'll also, a lot of people start getting stability in their lives and the last thing they want to do is go off the fucking rails for the night and, B, it's one thing when you work in as a waiter on Monday morning and a job that you don't plan on keeping them as long as still stolen. Fucking Laos. Yeah, but that's fine if you are, if you're trying to get ahead in this crazy world, this crazy capitalist world, you have to be at work on time and you have to get there. You have to get some sleep in you so that you can perform. You can actually have a a good frame of mind. So the boss enjoys your company and wants to keep you around you productive to the company.

Speaker 3:          01:06:44       That's hard to do when you get fucked up on Payoti and go fuck a dancing naked to the desert at night. The next day you have a fucking black guy because your face had a law because you thought you could fly and the elevator on the way to work the next day he'd be like, what am I doing here guys? What are we actually doing here? Yeah, and for her, I mean she's, like I said, she's the, um, the science editor for the Huffington post is the, or the science correspondent, whatever her official title is. It's like a big title. It's an important position. So you can't be out there and getting fucked up every night coming to work and forgetting what you're talking about in the middle of a sentence. That vice magazine and thing of that guy going to the dog show on acid. No asked for the first time and going to the, um, the dog show in New York.

Speaker 3:          01:07:27       It was great. Oh, that sounds like hunter s Thompson came back to life and entered into that writer's mind. Big frizzy heritage. Fucking Rad. And he's trying to like, and what's your deal? You look like your dog. That's an, he's talking about his, like the air conditioner would come on. It would feel so good at my face. My favorite all time to piction of Vegas is a hunters Thompson's fear and loathing talks about us being fucked up in the casino when they were all on ether and calves. Amazing. All on ether. Yeah, like he took all kinds of shit. It was just taking everything I whatever, whatever with filled with acid and ether and Indian, they were driving to to Vegas in the story and it was like right about and Barstow, the drugs began to take hold as a sportswriter starts. That's how it starts.

Speaker 3:          01:08:13       And this, this was all for sports illustrated. So sports illustrated thought they were going to get some story on covering a motorcycle race and it's dead. Hunter s Thompson release like one of the most brilliant pieces of American literature. Just this crazy little trouble. I mean it's crazy. It's brilliant and it's all about drugs. It's all about the Chi being fucked up, having a good time. And it was the first time like in, in that era, a lot of what drug use was, was like the more annoying shaded. Yeah. That's so mainstream. A lot of people associated drugs with like drum circles and sitting around holding hands and hit the shot to deep. Yeah. Lying down on Indian rugs and that music and Thompson instead at a red Cadillac and fucked up on acid. Just driving around with a cigarette holder coming out of his mouth. He cigarette holder.

Speaker 3:          01:09:11       He just, it was another one. It was another guy that to me. Let me know that I'm okay. You're fine. Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah, because the, the, the nuttiest fucks amongst us all get derided before they eventually get accepted. How bad you think you worked for masturbating? Yeah. I'll tell her at some point you're like, I'm a horrible human. He just think this is going to be the last time I'm going to quit. Yeah. Just, yeah, exactly. I'll just, I'll stop. I can handle it next time I'm going to quit. I don't need this in my life anymore and they just need someone out there saying like when I was younger than my masturbated. Oh. Oh, okay. Nobody even brought it up to me. It was never even discussed. They got to, I get to talk to your kids about it. Fuck yeah, I'm have your girl do it.

Speaker 3:          01:09:54       Absolutely. Let them know it's just normal. And not only is it normal, but you probably should do it because it will help you make better choices. It was like, well, I make them go through that horrible time. Just want to rely on one other person to be like your drug dealer when it comes to sex. Especially when you're a young kid and your hormones are on full blaze. You're just too embarrassed to talk about it. And that's why you confuse all the time. You're making shitty choices cause you're always horny, you know? So you're hanging out with girls you really shouldn't be hanging out with. You're doing things you really shouldn't be doing just because you're so desperate to get this drug. That's sex. When I was 17 years old, dude, yeah, when I was 17 years old, I got hooked on posting. It was a drug.

Speaker 3:          01:10:33       There's no question about it. My parents showed me, why did you lose your virginity? Like do they really know? What do they grab your deck? Stroke it and that slot no slope. Brian. Don't be eager. When did you lose your virginity, Brian? 1515 yeah. Why did you lose yours? It was around then too. I don't think it was right before I was 16 who was in like 15 and 16 like right with who was it with you? But there was a girl who I've fooled around with it. I could have fucked, but I panicked when I was 13 she was still the local neighborhoods slut, the Hoochie Mama. She was 21 and I was 13 wow. Yeah. And you would've, you could've done it there. Yeah. Yeah, totally. Nerve wracking panic, complete panic. And by the way, I, when I was 13 I really didn't know much about getting hard on, so really had no idea what that was all about.

Speaker 3:          01:11:20       That really was like a completely, I me every now and then I got one like, okay, there it is. But I hadn't started the masturbation process. What that was going to do for you. The harder, yeah. I didn't start masturbating, believe it or not until after I had sex. Yeah, me too. What? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I didn't like it at first because that was just like, this is a pale comparison to sex. Yeah, it's a pale comparison. But I realized then that I was having a hard time seeing things clearly. I was realizing like, wow, sounds pants up waiting my whole life. I've always been a very reluctant to get stuck in like some situation that I can't get out of any, any kind of situation that I can't get out of anything that feels like, oh fuck, I'm not even commitment, but something that I feel where I'm stuck.

Speaker 3:          01:12:06       I'm in a needy position, you know, I don't like the apartment. Listen, shut the fuck up. Jesus Christ here. So when I first started getting sex from this girl, I wasn't panicking cause I need sex all the time now. But you need to look at it from her. I needed to get it all the time, but I, and then dealing with her was craziness. She was nuts and you know, she was also fucking other dudes, you know, like she would like fuck my friends and shit. Like this girl was crazy. We tried. Anyway, you try to make her, um, get a lot of questions there. Anyway, my point is once I started jerking off, I realized, Oh, I could do this on my own. Like I don't need to only be around this crazy girl. You know, you don't have to intern about situations. Exactly. Exactly. Wow. So you didn't do it before that? No, no,

Speaker 6:          01:12:51       no. My problem is I, I thought you were supposed to use Vaseline because of ice cube where somebody used to always say like, no Vaseline and shit. So I thought that's what you use the master. But I didn't know there was like lotions and stuff like that. So I remember it was just really like, this is not, you know, like it was not, it did not feel good.

Speaker 3:          01:13:06       I, I would, uh, I would just pull my pants down around my ankles or my, my knees and I would just let my cock rest on the bed and I would just move up and down with my ankles to give slight pressure and feel until it would just come into my belly and shoots. Well. Yeah, I started off pills before I did my hand for like a good five years. Well, how many people must fuck silk sheets feel wonderful. It gives kids, yeah, they do. I had some silk underwear. I used to rub it against that silk underwear. A fantastic, you beat off of Phil Silk Underwear. It's almost as good as beaten off with like Vaseline, homeless people. I never got that into lotion. Homeless people should sell their bodies more. Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:13:50       You know, or they should like take care of like cleaning themselves out and like prostitute more like you don't really see.

Speaker 3:          01:13:54       Yeah, there you go. That's a good fucking idea. Brian. You went crazy. People blowing you. I saw in Montreal I saw a homeless lady and a homeless God boyfriend, girlfriend. Uh, they were hanging on the alley behind a club soda. And then, uh, I was like, oh, that's nice. At least found that somebody, you know. Right. But then the next day I saw that girl was somebody else. Oh, that dirty bitch. Yeah. Yeah. She was just, she wasn't cheating. She was just a prostitute, homeless person. Do they work at the six bucks it takes to to, to get that wonder what a homeless guy has to get like two cigarettes, much homeless. I don't know what it would be. I don't know. Price wise. I don't know. We had Victor Conte on the podcast. He's are the the storage guy and he was telling us that there was a certain security guard and the Gal that he was at that was turning tricks.

Speaker 3:          01:14:38       Wow. She'd make money by banging the inmates. Really? Yeah. It was like minimum security people that like fucked up business. They did like creepy shit but college they weren't dangerous. Yeah. Greedy bitches. So they probably had money so she made extra money by, yeah, I don't have a cash back and get you a check and I'm good for it. Blowing guards that would make prison way better. That's an that really butchy girl did an odd, she would always jerk him off in the, in the maybe a lot of yard time. Okay. Any activities like with Tommy Chong described, he described it. He was at the same place. If they gave you a like a lot of like freedom and you get blowjobs from hot guards, that sounds like it'd be a good place to live. She says he's John Travolta was the warden. That sounds like a lot of people would be like, let me just stay here.

Speaker 3:          01:15:26       She was hot picture context one. Yeah, she said she was, he said she was hot. She said she had big tits. Tits would be sticking out of her dress and he was hurt. He fuck is going on or Brian you trying a little too hard too. I wonder if talking about guy guards and I think that you're talking about girl guards. I forgot. And he was uh, he was saying that this, uh, this chick, like he didn't know what the hell is going on, like what's up with her? And he goes, Oh yeah, you want some of that? He was like, what do you mean? It's like I could, I could arrange that for, you know, she's a, she's x amount of dollars and she comes and dude, was it a challenge over time out? What are we talking about? No, look normal. Regular hooker prices.

Speaker 3:          01:16:01       Yeah. Yeah. I would imagine the $500 somewhere around there, maybe even a thousand for like you get the shooting her eyes or she knows these are all rich people can't make it worth the time that I was and you shoot it up her nose. Special requests. Yeah. I wonder if girls have things like that. I wonder if he wants to do that because somebody thing definitely this somebodies thing, the coming in the eyes thing in porn is like the shooting loads, all of a girls' faces and all of their eyelashes and shit. There's something really nutty about that man. Something really, if someone wants to do that for sure they want to stick the little, that little penny hole right up to the nostril and just shoot it right in there. Geesh. Make it come out the other night and know that I'm not even saying something that's original. I'm sure someone has done, there's probably a whole website dedicated to it. Cocks, not glocks probably. I wonder if you go to cox.com let's see. Let's just go crazy and go to Cox. Not Cox. Not. That was a, that was a tagline. You're getting me for a joke once. Yeah. That's a nice name for your loads. Your

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       one. Oh, look at this. [inaudible] is one of those websites. It's not really a website. When you go there, it's like watch adult cams. Casual sex for gay men because they know someone's in the Cox. Not Exactly Alaskan Fire Dragon. No, I'm not going to do it. I know what that one is. Yes. I've been to that website. You son of a bitch you would already see with the story of the boy who cried wolf. Yeah. Ladies at home or walk over to that junk. Go to that site. Okay. Don't need to see that. You don't know what it is he showed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Blame the new guy. Cocks. Not. Maybe it'll start up now. If there's anybody out there that wants to start car by Cox, not.com and you consultation and what would be the best Cox, not videos. I did at one time where a girl let me tire up and then I all over her face and stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:18:00       Whoa. It was really hot. Whoa. Yeah. Whoa. What? What? What's up with this freaky bed? She's just like, we had done it a bunch of times. She was like, she was her idea. What a good carer. She had a ball gag. She had the whole, Oh, she had a ball gag dude. It was a real used and shit all busted down. She works at a ball gag was like two years old. It, it was someone who had been thrown into a rottweiler, locked up flowers, fucking stray hairs all over it. Lipstick from a 10 different shades. Mother take it was dirty as fuck. She been getting ball gag and horse fucked for decades already comes along. He's like, oh, I just happened to have a baguette. It was all brand new from a porn shop. You got a bucket this, what'd you drag this behind?

Speaker 2:          01:18:47       A fucking truck. They chip it. Chilling on that thing has a ballgame. The edges. What? A chick pulls out a ball gag. One of the first things you think, is this going to be my wife? This is not gonna make it. This one is not. She's not going to hit the big time. This is unless you're that guy. I mean that's gotta be fun for a while. Yeah. And then by the way, I'm not your guy either. You gotta find the right one. Just someone out there that loves that. She's like, he doesn't have his own ball gag people that love the whole cuckold idea. Kuk Holding is like big in this country. A lot of people that are into it, very about it. But behind that, the man's, why don't you explain it for, cause there's a lot of people are be like hearing, it's when you, it's when you, well, there's a type of porn by it.

Speaker 2:          01:19:39       But the real thing is when you watched the woman you're with, um, get fucked by someone else, like watching you say black guy, wife get fuck. Yeah. And the W in Brian's talking about is fucking bookmarks. Uh, because it's embarrassing. They said a black eye is worse because it's like, there's Mandingo like stuff going in with Eric too. Like my poor wife, she's really good and she's taken it to this guy and she has to watch it. Now. There's these porn of it where it's, you see a guy watching his wife get fucked and that's a weird another because

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       then you're not in bed. You don't feel bad yourself. You just feel bad on his behalf. Yeah, we'll get you off, man. That's a weird thing. Like that's what I want. Yeah. It would have to be POV to the camera. A saying I never loved you. Oh and less. It's all black dudes who are downloading that type of porn and they love the idea of giant Dick and humiliating this weeks off. I know there are some dicks online I reviewed, uh, I went back and look over the Kim Kardashian sex tape recently with open eyes and I forgot how big that dude's Dick is. Holy Shit. Really? She's two fist in this guy's cock with plenty of room [inaudible] room. He has a giant Dick. I mean this, we're talking, this dude has a 12 year olds hands. I don't think, even if her hands are tiny, this guy has a monster of a duck.

Speaker 3:          01:21:05       Yeah, I mean it's like, I believe that. I forgot how big it was. I was like, man, maybe I just blacked that out because I was blacked that out. Get it. No Pun intended, because I just a, I was just terrified of my own inadequacies. Yeah. When you're watched that, because that's where that whole thing comes from. So yeah. So pop, it's supposed to get you harder because this is what the, the, the, um, I guess chemical reaction to it is whether or not the nature of what's going on in your brain really is that you have to compete to have your sperm live on so you get extra hard. So you could fucking pummel that. And this head of your dick is shaped like a plunger so you can get his sperm out of there while you're fucking her and so then your sperm will go in more.

Speaker 3:          01:21:49       Yeah. That's the whole idea of the mushroom cap. That's what makes you hard. Yeah, that's exactly what it is. Yeah. This guy, Ray Jay, he really hasn't worked much since it's video. And my theory is because he's been banging 30 to 40,000 girls day. Once they saw his giant Dick and he probably said, why do I even need to keep making music? He probably is making music. I'm just, he was on some a, B, I think he was on some bt reality show. Please rage. I don't slip me comedians and Dick and stuff. You don't need a job. Smacked me in the face with your giant cock. I was just joking, but you could still get it. It's on these free porn sites. Do that. Would you let them do that for you? What? Slapping your face for charity? No, for charity. We're going to fight or slap me in the face where he'd deck.

Speaker 3:          01:22:35       We're going to war $1 million for cancer research. I want to get you back when you can't slap me in the $100 million for cancer research. I'm not really buying all that research. I think a lot of coastal awaken search going on. I'm going to, I'm going to pull this. I can't. We can't show this on the Internet because you stream is, even though it is dead. Don't censor us. Yeah, I'm pulling it up right now. Even though the stream does not us. They're awesome, but they still, they can't. You can't. Someone can be at work and then accidentally you get this. Oh, we're gonna know that this was shaped like a thing can angry man. It's so stupid. Why are we living by dumb people's roles? Well, because Ray J's dick is safe for work. It's classic. Not Safe for work here. The thing that shit up.

Speaker 3:          01:23:29       Oh yeah, you get, did you do that? You son of a bitch. Look at the size of this. Wow. She's really spreading her mouth apart. Yeah. Do. But look at the length on that goddamn thing. I mean the width is pretty normal. Hey Brian can have that on camera. Yeah, I sideways. It just looked like, no, it didn't have been eating a pop shot up. It didn't want to see it. Why do you ruin things for me, Brian? Brian, you can't have it on Ustream. Dummy. That's bad. That's bad for everyone. That's bad for business anyway. That's pretty good. Don't get all horny. Now look at you thinking about beating off. While she was excellent form, she was going for it. Amazing that that led to the beginning of a very promising career. She wasn't prissy about it. Like Nicole Tilton or Paris Hilton. Yeah. Paris Hilton wasn't fucking a black guy.

Speaker 3:          01:24:16       Was fucking some weak white dude who had to put up with their bullshit. Rayjay doesn't put up with bitches. Bullshit. Oh yeah. It's a big giant deck and you got to suck it and you're going to turn your phone off. Okay. No fucking text the phone. That's probably the last time she had sex without texting was when they made that video. I bet she's just constantly checking our Twitter, texting. I bet you he's the only guy to keep her in line. It was like, I'm really busy. Of course I gotta check my texts. I listened to these two chicks talk about about her. It was really interesting. I don't know them. It was at an airport. They were like, they were, I wasn't, you know, it was like one of those situations where like you're facing that way and there's people from behind you there sitting those rows of chairs, the airport and they're right next to you, but you're not, you're not even looking at each other.

Speaker 3:          01:25:00       How does an inch away from there? But you're right. So she was talking about, I knew that she was talking about Kim carnation and right away it's like she's always dating these big athletes. Like it's always, it's like most often black guys. And then, and then just said that, I mean for real, she's never going to date a regular guy now because they're going to realize that, you know, she read what she really likes is those big black athletes, you know? And the other girl was like, Oh yeah, oh, I know. Like were like talking logic to each other. Like she made a bad move. Like that's what she was saying. She was almost saying like, like she ruined her opportunities in the future. Those girls don't think they can get those big black athletes. So I think the idea is, yeah, those girls get a regular guy and for a lot of crazy bitches, men are like, it's like playing musical chairs.

Speaker 3:          01:25:49       Like they look at like what they got to marry. You gotta marry well, you got to find a good one to get some regular white dude from regular boring guy and the fucking, well she might, she might have to one day. That was what, that's what's what these girls are thinking. These girls to think that she might have to, that she might get some situation which got to marry some media mogul that happens to be five foot four, which at the Mary, anyone rotund because rich shit falls apart now rich anymore. The shit hit the fan and now this poor little tiny guys going to always know that she's likes these big giant super athletes. Fucking the shit out of her. Like who is that one dude though? The one black football player that she was dating for a while. Very famous guy. Reggie Bush. Reggie Bush.

Speaker 3:          01:26:29       Reggie Bush owns my old Barracuda. Oh really? Yes. He bought it. He think he found her in it. I hope so, but I don't think so. That would be an honor. Um, but I mean that's, that's a guy like you look at the way he's built. He like, he must fuck her almost a death, you know? And how do you go from that to like a regular guy? You don't, you can't, she stuck. But now she's dating Kanye West and Kanye has gotten to be thinking about the fucking Bush put on that. He's gotta be, but Reggie Bush, Connie, you probably is this a thing and like that circle, that famous black circle of like, they all want to date the same people. Everyone's trying to date. Riana I want, it's their turn. Well there's a, there's like a benefit to dating Kim Kardashians. Like a clear benefit when it comes to get more famous.

Speaker 3:          01:27:18       Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well you guys doing over there? Brian's everything. Okay. And Lamar Odom is terrible in basketball now. Izzy, he's terrible. And is it because he's like a famous Kardashians now? I mean, you always hear it. You ever hear those things? I'm certainly seen UFC too, where it's like his head's not in it. He's got to focus and you're like, no, there are professional athletes. They but it's like no there focus gets robbed. Well it's fun. Especially like discipline is a real issue for athletes. So it's very, very hard to stay disciplined and train hard and do your, you know, your, your time in practice room when you're not, your focus has got to be on it during the extra stuff you do the extra stuff like strength and conditioning and the practice when you're not, it's not in season. And when here like jet setting all around the world banging a car dash and man, I bet.

Speaker 3:          01:28:02       Yeah, that becomes your focus and checking your Twitter. It definitely steal some focus. And when you look at the highest levels and you're starting to it hitting your thirties yeah, for sure man, that fucks no fucks with people's heads. And the fame you get from everybody knowing you, you're way more famous than the other basketball players on your team. Right. And you're famous for being a guy who bangs a cardiac Shan. Yeah. So you're in this weird group, you're the most famous non rapist on your basketball team. And you, well, how dare you, and he was acquitted wasn't here. It wasn't never trade. Your spotter off does not testify. You could do that. Yeah. And then she won't testify. There's no case. The um, the thing is like, he must be like looking at Bruce Jenner and he must be saying that's, that's what's happening. That's my future. I'm going to just center. It was a top level athlete. Fuck. Aa was gold metal winner in the Olympics. Man. Hero hero on the cover. We some goofy ass for it. Did it help us defend the fucking Dakota's? He fought off the ruskies understand with a javelin

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       and a good jumps more than another guy. Yeah. It's one of those weird sports and nobody gives a fuck about decathlon or something like that. Such a killer fucking bit about that. Which normal horse. Oh yeah. You just whip out only for Olympics. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to have it for like a single, it's like seasonal commercials. They do those, I'll blame for like five years, but only for like two weeks at a time. I could probably still do that. Probably the Olympics or Paralympics. Especially location and it's so poignant, stupid ass. Why are we looking at this? You would never watch most of the sports during the Olympics if they were on TV every weekend. And New Buddy caterers that comes from a time of when you were like roof the white fighter over the black fighter. Cause like the drummer will always beat the black and uh, in a battle, doxing is a thinking man's sport.

Speaker 2:          01:29:47       Well that was why I was a big deal when Max Schmeling knocked out Joe Louis, it was a huge victory for the, not for the white people. White people too. And that's why they get so mad at when Moses or whatever his name is, this, the printer, uh, in Munich. What'd he do? He in front of like the Hitler, he likes and won the gold medal and it took the American flag and like waved it in front of Hitler. Oh really? Yeah. It was like a black guy in Munich or something like that. You know, maybe he fucking made Hitler ticket to the next level. Yeah. I think that was the limits when all the Palestinians killed those Israelis. Could, you know that was the Munich Olympics wasn't it? Was it? But Hitler was before that. Oh yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't have been Hitler. Hitler was in the forties.

Speaker 2:          01:30:24       It might've been during the rise of Hitler. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. Um, or they got the back there again. Yeah. The Munich Olympics, when they, the Palestinians killed those people. I believe it was in told Sandra Mondays he gave hill in the middle finger. No, he did not. Did Not. Jesse Owens gave Hitler Middle Finger. I don't remember that. That would have been talked about a weird thing. It must be to be a runner and hoping that everyone was going to protect you while you're running by just a crazy dictator. Yeah. Just one of the great minds of dictatorship and military, like, like ruthless military campaigns. Brendan Burns always says that he didn't think, he didn't think a Hitler would have been mad about it. Can you just would've thought the Americans were cheating by using animals. Oh, he's an amazing that they were really trying to devise a master race. Like that was her, that was something that people were agreeing on.

Speaker 2:          01:31:15       Like, Yep. We got to do this right. We got to do this. Right. Yeah. S a part of me sort of gets that though. Well, there's a lot of utility out of things over aggression. Sure. If he said we don't value as a society, yeah, I can breathe that out. I would like to, yeah. And if you could really figure out a way to get, well, we're going to have to do some work. It's going to be ugly. We can get the world to a beautiful place where there's virtually no cons. And now that we have revamped the entire education system, we can ensure that future generations, we're also not be cons, but the only way we can do this as we got to kill all the cuts because the cons make more cuts. So we have to find all the cons and figure out a way to not make contacts out of the bay from the, uh, the sterilization shots. It's not just that, because they cannot turn the kids in the top kids. They turn those kids into cons. Yeah. If you're around a family of cons, it's very hard to not be wanting. If your next door neighbor was fun and a bunch of like assholes, probably not going to learn from that. Yeah. If you live in a horrible yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:32:16       Environment. I mean it's probably very difficult to be a philanthropist when you were in Liberia and you're struggling for your life, you know, my sister was told I curse. I try not to, but I curse my normal length. Try not to try not to around her kids. Oh right. Or Orthodox children. How old are they? Like

Speaker 2:          01:32:35       13 or 14 and the 12 and like whatever. But it's like they must be so excited when uncle are sober. Try. But at the same time it's like, well, it's not that bad. It's just a word that I think should be part of their vocabulary. Do they? It's better. It's a better word. Why would you hide vocabulary from someone? It's nonsense. Allow them to know what's right to use.

Speaker 3:          01:32:55       Yeah. It's a stupid, stupid old thing that doesn't make any sense. And you know, the idea, I mean, this is like Lenny Bruce covered this shit

Speaker 2:          01:33:02       in the 1960 [inaudible] going on. It's still the same. The fact that it's 2012 and we still have magic words gotta kill off the Christians, man. Well, the craziest thing about the, the, the censorship of these magic words and said, now they've made it incredibly expensive to do. Like if you go on, go on TV and you violate those for real, nobody cares about it. Only has power because we say, [inaudible] who song doesn't curse out? It doesn't believe how fuck.

Speaker 3:          01:33:31       Yeah. Well that's what a Lenny Bruce, his argument was about the word nigger in like 1960 was saying, you know what the problem is? You know that that word can still hurt someone. The reason why that word hurts someone is everyone's afraid of that word. You just said it enough. It would never be able to hurt some, some young black boy. Yeah. You know, I'm a young black child. It was a really, uh, interesting that this guy figured that out in the 1960s and an error where you realize very few people thinking like that in Israel. Nobody uses that word now, which wasn't the derogatory word. Oh, that's, and she could just say it. People were like on whatever. So, but yeah, that someone talked about that when they get off the plane. Who was that? Brian? Someone talked about on the podcast that they got off the plane and they said it because you can say it there. We used to say it in the streets to each other. Maybe it was me. I don't know. It wasn't saying, if someone was saying that whenever they land they say it out loud because uh, in Israel doesn't mean anything. They get off the plane.

Speaker 2:          01:34:27       I got it. There might be someone on the plane still though. Even just stopping and American black guy like check around first. Oh yeah. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:34:37       Kardashians. No black people let it ride. Let's go. Let's have this. Indeed. Indeed. How am I going announcement? Yeah. What's your name? I'm recording my special

Speaker 2:          01:34:50       now. Do that. But no, not that. Not this right now. It seems kind of rude. I'm just doing it. I'm typing it in and it's doing one those men, my next blank man. Yeah. Right now, if you were doing it right now, say, I don't think you're giving it your best effort. It seems like you're, you're also having a conversation. You do both. It's like, I think our standup needs work. It's December 28th at in Brooklyn, New York at the knitting factory. I'm doing two shows. The knitting factory tickets are on sale now and that's a, that's a short amount of time since you've done your last one. It's, it seems, well I tried doing it like in uh, October of last year and then I didn't record it again until May, but I put this stuff away, put the material away when I thought it was one in May. And now you're doing another one in December.

Speaker 2:          01:35:34       Yeah. But the main one was from October's material. Right. But that's still pretty impressive them writing. What made you decide to release it so quickly? Like I said, I was going to do it a year. From what I tried to start in the first one and see if I could write an hour and a year having a game. Right. You're came around. I dropped all the old material, all this stuff on the album was all done. I only did it again for a month to get a fresh. Now when you go and do like, um, if you have like an exploratory set like okay, this is all new shit, I'm going to go up there. And do you do that during regular headlines sets or do you set aside til I get, I get, well I had the luxury of of the first album didn't come out right. So I was building material and I could still do the old material if I needed to for a paid gig. It's like I got to do 45 minutes to an hour. Right. I got it. I got to reach into the well, right, right, right. But for any 15 minute set in la, it's like I can get there without this. It took me like a month to bill to do the first like 12 minutes to when the light came on and I was still doing the material. That's cool. That's like well over a month,

Speaker 2:          01:36:35       like two months.

Speaker 9:          01:36:36       But uh,

Speaker 2:          01:36:38       yeah, I guess it was not there.

Speaker 6:          01:36:41       It's kind of cool how sometimes that happens though. Like I, I once you started, it just kept coming out of me that knew strip clubs story that I talk about going to Dayton, Ohio, which the owner just died the other day of the living room in Dayton, Ohio. So I'm sorry if I cursed you. Uh, but that story and the dolphin, this dolphin bit I did, it just added like almost 10 minutes to my act and just one weekend.

Speaker 2:          01:37:01       Yeah, that can happen, man. You can get one idea that just really takes off. Yeah. That's, that's my favorite time when they just get longer and longer and stuff. Yeah. You just keep adding your time. My friend Mike's store, this comedian in Maryland, he was like, well, you know, I still have new stuff I want to add to the old jokes. Right, right, right. My theory is that same creative energy you can just shifted to new jokes. Yeah, totally. The only reason you're all writing stuff for old jokes is cause you're, that's all you're focusing on. Yeah. But then there's always like, the problem is when you release a joke and then right after you do it, you gotta have a new tech line, excuse me, new tag dot doing it. It's like done with it. So once I get enough, like enough to like go on the road with and it's like, okay, we're fine. And then, uh, you just weed out all the other stuff until you don't have to do it anymore. So now you got it to the point where you're super happy with it, you're ready to go. I'm at the point where I'm on the road now I'm deciding there's still bits I can't do cause I don't have time for it. She had a lot of change a lot when you started getting like long headlines

Speaker 3:          01:37:55       and that was the first time I've ever done that. So I consistently did it, started doing an hour five times a week instead of 15 minutes. Seven or eight times a week. Yeah. Yeah. Plus the 15 minutes in town to, to fuck around with, you know, the Tuesday, Wednesday sets. Those hours sets are, wouldn't you really get to stretch out? Yeah. You got that all the time. Yeah. Yeah. How much material you can just get to all the stuff you're working on. Yeah. I was doing that even back when I lived in New York. I really, yeah, I didn't believe in those little sets. I would say I would see this guys that do the sets in town and one of the, one of the things that I saw that was a pattern was that, uh, a lot of them, although they were great comics, they were doing like jokes.

Speaker 3:          01:38:38       It was there basically saying a lot of things that didn't really happen. And they were, you know, writing a bunch of really funny stuff and they were setting up and it was almost either impersonal or it was very worky. The crowdy. Oh, right. You know why they set it up? Yeah. There, you know they would like bring, it was like they were very tight clubs and they're very small stages and the a quick, oh yeah. How long would you get back down if you were lucky you got 15 minutes. I think danger fields would give you the longest, I don't remember it was 20 or 30 minutes. Danger fields gave you like a real set that was the only place in town that everything else was like the most, you would get us like 15 minutes or something like that. Sometimes it was seven, sometimes it was 10 but those are hard because it's all you get.

Speaker 3:          01:39:20       It's like well I only have one or you can total it. Like look at a towel. It's hell came from that world and it's brilliant. It's just his, but his act is that style of, you know, a bunch of shit that's not really happening. And then a clown came out and bloom. Hey, but some guys do like long stories that come out of there too. Very few. Yeah. It doesn't seem like that. But they don't do, they do 15 or 20 minutes. That's, and you know what those stories out and, and doing the road. Yeah. The road is where it comes out the road. Like those long weekends when you're doing four shows in a weekend, five shows, we do an hour in la for years. Yeah. Nobody really does that. Yeah. That was lucky too. And um, and then there's all the satellite rooms around la that's always thrown to the Bray Improv ice.

Speaker 3:          01:40:03       Yeah. Yeah. We have a good spot right now. This is a, there's a lot of places to work out and fuck around here, but that's the big leap that happens I think as a comic when you started being a headline or you get to go longer when you get to go longer and you sort of understand pacing too. Like even instinctually, like you do a set and you're like, maybe that one was a little off because I did a little too much of this and not enough of that and I need to like go high and then bring it down a little bit in two hours, two hours have to get off of been doing this joke again. Yeah. And then you start looking at your notes and going over your shit and rearranging things and then you have a new idea pops in your head.

Speaker 3:          01:40:37       It's like everything else, so as a segue works really well. It's like, oh yeah. It's like everything else. The more focus you put on it, the more results the results are. That's why Lamar Odom is fucking terrible now. Tomorrow it all comes back to you and Mario. Okay. It all comes back to the Kardashian family. What are you going to have your special come out when? 18th the 18th of December. Nice. Yeah. The new website is going live any day now. It should be like either today or tomorrow if you finished it. Yeah, it's done. Cheesy, cheesy. I didn't have to edit much. It was almost all the first show in Atlanta, the first show. I got everything the way I want it to accept like a couple of taglines that I stuck in from the second show. It was really easy. It was easy. Yeah. There was a couple, a couple of lines that I forgot in the first show, but it was such a great crowd was so fun.

Speaker 3:          01:41:23       We wanted to take those lines that you've forgotten victims fitting back in there. It's just don't lose them forever. I had to put them in there. There'll be gone because they forgot library. Yeah, they would be gone forever. They were really good lines and a, they don't fit anywhere else. Not Right. They're a joke. It's just pertaining to that one subject. I can't go back to that side of [inaudible] would like to wear. Yeah, it was easy because I did the same bid and the second show so I just took part of it and I I it was only twice on two. Uh, two different. You got sidetracked in your mind sometimes when you're like talking like, oh look, a normal human. Yeah, fuck goes. And he dropped the next two sentences you were going to say, yeah, that and you and I have similar styles in that we're not very structured on stage.

Speaker 3:          01:42:00       We fuck around a lot and then leave ourselves room to ad Lib. And I do that even when I record special and you forget to go back to. Yeah. So I do all of a sudden he sold to like try a little more to do just to get through it. Word for word. I would think so but no, not the last. That special that I did in Atlanta was the first time that I was ever on stage or even though it was filming a special, it was exactly like I was having a comedy shows having a set. Yeah you did everything the same. You know it wasn't like all right look I have to do this sober because this is fuck that. Pass it, pass it. It's do this. We you know had the, I had a beer, I think I had a glass of wine. There was that guy who snuck into the green room, brought his own beer, remember that ship Ryan

Speaker 7:          01:42:42       really weird and he just snuck in ahead like, like somehow like I'm your man with a beard for Joe Rogan. Local beer maker. Wanted to just wanted to get me his beer, bullshitted his way into the green room. Cool guy with like that seemed like a nice guy. I'm going to thank him on the CD cover early for the beer. You can drink the beer. Drank his beer. Nice guy. I thought it was a ballsy move. Not that I'm encouraging it. You fuck stop it. Enough of that bullshit my way into places. I'm sure he did. That whole Trent Reznor thing's hilarious. The most embarrassing thing. One time I got my self like back into the green room about Wayne Concert and uh, I wasn't supposed to be back there and I was with this girl and I was just like, we came in and were like, hey guys, what's up? And they booked all just like looked over. I think they were doing something bad or something like that. They were like, okay, get out. And then I'm like, so they left you there. I just asked you that. Have some cool thing they do with the Internet. Like you're allowed to use their, their songs for like pretty much anything [inaudible] now. Yeah. They have all the songs on loop nonstop from Pandora before that time. But yeah, you're allowed like use them

Speaker 3:          01:43:51       for things too. They're like, let people use their songs. Really. I know. I, I'd, I'd heard something like that. Like they let go ahead. Like it's put it in a rap song and do whatever the fuck you want. That song. Hash pipe. That's a bad ass on hash. I know that reserve version of it. Oh, pull. Pull it up Brian. See if he could pull it out. Wean Hash Pipe. It's fucking great song. Yeah, it's my favorite Wayne Song. Really? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I can't believe you've never heard it. I never really got that.

Well they should sue because I got confused. So shows whoever was first. Wayne broke up now. So it's all these weeds are still together.

Speaker 3:          01:44:37       Yeah. That's all I got for it. Do it. Well guess what? We use better hash pipe songs. The Shit I loved. Weezer man, is this it? Yeah. And cleaning kit. The commercials. Oh God. Commercials. You know what's gross man? I've been reading websites lately.

Speaker 3:          01:48:30       One of our new sponsors has this a fucking sick game for the IPAD. I pulling my iPad out of storage. I stopped using my iPad because um, uh, even though it's an awesome tool, I would read books on it mostly. And I went back to like just a regular book reader because I found that if I know that I can just stop reading this book and go online. I'll just go online and let us, let me check my email real quick. And then Noah, what Lincoln was this? That someone's Sunday man. And then the next thing you know, I'm fucking, I'm not reading anymore. I'm, I'm sitting in front of my computer veggie now. Um, so I'm going to pull it out of retirement just to load up this fucking game. Oh really? First scared. What's the game called? It's called Blade slinger heads. Who made, who's making it?

Speaker 3:          01:49:12       Our new sponsor. It's called kerosene games. And uh, they're, they're, they're starting to make really sick gains directly. Yes. But it's not, it's an iPad game only iPad. Yes. They make an android coming sick. High resolution games only for the IPAD or the computer? No, no, no. I think we're computer man. They computer science. Good. You want the touch controller? Yeah, those are fun. Yeah, like all those stupid buttons and everything. Like that's why like Nintendos and all that shit. That's those mother fuckers are on the way out move shit like it starts with cash generation. That's the, that's the best way of interfacing. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       Know Poland triggers is fun. Like actually pulling the trigger, those video games where you pull out, you have to plug the thing in offscreen to reload. Those were fun games. Zombie Games. Yeah. I love those. Took that to the next level and had like a three d virtual reality software world you could go to. They didn't intend to. We has a new virtual virtually no like no virtual glasses. Will you think you're in that world and actually shooting zombies was going to go that way, right? Yeah. They must be close to that. I think something happened and like the visuals were stalled out for a long. Dave and Buster's had something click close but you didn't really feel like you were there but you sorted it. I don't remember that one that much, but I know I remember something about that like they had, they had tried it but it sucked the fat one.

Speaker 2:          01:50:35       It just wasn't that good. I want it to be like inception where you just fucking go, you can kill anybody, but if you get killed, boom, you're awake, you're out, you know. Ah, that's possible. Why wouldn't it be possible? You really feel like you're there. Will you remember in inception when he realized at the end that he was still in it? Spoiler alert, Euler. He didn't realize, he didn't realize it, but we realized, we realized that there was care anymore. Some fuckery afoot perhaps locked in a alternate reality. The debts. That would be the coolest way to experience a video game for sure it would be, but I feel like they had that in the x files and it like, it would go bad of course like someone would get killed in the virtual world. If you had a feel game inside, you were like the, like the scoring was inside your body.

Speaker 2:          01:51:21       Explain like, like, like you'd look up and you'd see the score inside your, your eyes feel like if you fucking get hit with feel it. Yeah. Driving game. We sick too and you could just see like you're looking at the inside of a windshield or have your score up there. Virtual reality, airplane simulators, flight simulations, those are big early on. Airplane simulators. Well they use them for training. They still use it for training pilots. And so is that why the nerds liked it? Cause I could feel like army people. Yeah. Well also, you know it's, it's how they train people to handle like how a plane really reacts. Like they can get it pretty close. I never, I was like, you don't kill anybody in these things. No, you don't shoot anything. No, no, no, no, no. Check out this iPad game. All right. This is about flying around. Look at it. This is the game. Like wow, the graphics are fucking slow to avoid that guy.

Speaker 5:          01:52:17       And this is like, you know, you're in an airport or something somewhere and you want to waste some time. You will run out of batteries planning this motherfucker. The cool thing about it is that

Speaker 10:         01:52:32       decided to make these things, uh, have you played that game and just see the preview. Yeah. I've been playing this since Beta. It's really good. Fine.

Speaker 2:          01:52:41       Okay, well I'll ask. It's like one of those games like, I don't know. Have you ever done where you like you swipe left and right,

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       like, you know, attack them? Whenever I look at video games that yeah. Okay. I feel like I'm a heroin addict. That's like, it just, I just always know there's going to be a day when I'm gonna come back. Oh yeah. You're a junkie. It's like, it's like a heroin addict to say, listen, I'm going to not do heroin for at least five years, but there's going to be one day where I'm going to put on some fucking pink Floyd. That's what alcoholics do. They still say they're alcoholics. Get back to, is the new trapped in the closet, do you know?

Speaker 4:          01:53:13       No. It's up to chapter 32 32 it's r Kelly ended up in class. You don't even know their videos

Started out as a music video that became this sort of like a musical that became a DVD and I bought it and I've sat there and wash it with mouth agape, like just horrible. It's unbelievably, but it's not just horrible, but it's like what's it's, it's insanity. It's like complete insanity. But it's so insane that it becomes really good. It becomes entertaining because it's so crazy.

Uh, it was one of my favorite things, but the problem was I watched it so many times that I actually had to like promise myself I wasn't going to watch it anymore because I was watching it like once every couple of days and it was like I was wasting big chunks of my time and then I would shut it off like two minutes in going, what am I doing? Why am I still watching this?

Speaker 5:          01:57:31       Hmm.

And this one is for the ladies, you know, and you know, anything, any ad this, uh, this advertisement. I was excited. I'm like, I want to see this concert. Yeah. I want to see this craziness that this guy's putting out. Lizzy Dylan, he might've fucked too many women. I might've gone crazy with it. Yeah. Well, could you imagine the volume of crazy pussy that r Kelly, how's going his way? Just the volume. The sheer volume of if you ever seen him in concert and seeing those girls go crazy for him.

Speaker 1:          02:00:47       No. Oh, there we go. No significant. Yeah. Oh my God. They just scream and lose their mind. Sane. Insane. They're going nuts. Wow. There's thousands of them and they're all women and they're going to bananas. There's like four gay guys in the crowd and that's it. The rest is women, women, men on dates and shit. You know, and some dudes you can respect real talk, but for the most part, a lot of crazy bitches did that. Is that whole sleeve more? Mostly knew this one. Yeah. That's like three years old. I don't remember the flower with a stripe down the middle of it. Oh, the, um, like up a little cherry blossom. Yeah, that's right here. Yeah. Yeah. That's been there. I got to go back to them. Thank you very much, Darren Dellavedova from girl Tattoo. It's not done yet. It's not finished. I love following him on Facebook because every like every day or so he'll post like new photos of work he he's

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       doing are doing right now and it's just so cool to look at his art every day. Sometimes he puts a button at the insight. Brian, well he doesn't do, but we should do clarify. He doesn't do like dragons on your Dick or anything freaky. So if you're one of those markets, if he's showing you it's because he like tattooed a cheek or something like that. Okay. It's not like the actual butthole, like excellent. My favorite [inaudible] I need to get my tattoo fucking done cats and she would get, she said she'd do it. She was probably lying. Yeah, she probably wasn't that long ago. I'm sure she wasn't. It's probably a matter of right down, but then it's like not through it. If they don't call me. Yeah, I'd rather not spend 20 hours. I think she would do it. It just, you might want to like see if he could get the old one laser the little first.

Speaker 3:          02:02:28       So it's just not like, yeah, because if he want to get something there, you know, if you want to get a tattoo there right now, you've got this big spot there. Where are you going to have some anchor that you don't want the other arm? Let's see. Get, have an idea of what you want to do with that area. The desk squad cat around that in the circle could actually be where the, the uh thing though. Just have that clock. The clock would be one. I have the oh yeah. The only problem is it'd be really hard. It's like got to have white ink over the uh, the red. It's going to be a black one with a white mustache. No, no, no. The what is the circle? They're like, what's the Red Circle? Oh, that's going to be the clock and I'll just keep, just keep that old time face looking thing like an antique, you know what I'm saying to you?

Speaker 3:          02:03:08       You want to keep it, you want it to be a red face. The clock? Yeah. Why not? Instead of holding the class holding the cat is holding your original tattoo. Cool. That's, that'll last. We'll also have like a story for her and you'll feel good that you took this thing that sucked. It made it better. You recycled? Yeah. Yeah. It'll look cool if it's a little worn down to deal when dudes from random place to start getting that tattooed on my body. That's a super hard, super hard. Super hard with a finger up your butt.

Speaker 3:          02:03:43       What does that even Ari soundbite. That's of my album and that's the one that's available right now. That's only been for sale for like how long? A couple of months now. It was number one. The 25th yeah. Number one. Number one iTunes. And then from that you've already got a whole new hour. That's pretty fuckin industrious young man. Yeah, but it's been like, it's been like 14 months when it would've recorded. Right. When Aubrey called you and told you that he liked what I was doing in Texas, that was like three months ago. And that's all. It was all new. That's awesome man. Yeah, it feels, yeah, it feels kind of cool. You're doing the same shit. You're writing so much now. Yeah. I think it's just a matter of working out that muscle. It's definitely got better at it. It's definitely that. Um, I think podcasts help too, man. Work your mind. You mean it helps everything. It helps expand your subject. Yeah. So many things that we talk about on the podcast that they become like, or a new stories or whatever. That becomes super interesting also, especially on this podcast. He talked to a lot of interesting weird people.

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       So you gain perspective. Oh yeah. That more than you would've before. Getting firsthand like talk to them where you can actually, you know, understand things. Yeah. And it's a bigger well to draw from sh yeah. And we're getting new people all the time too. Like this chick that we had yesterday, Cara Santa Maria, she was fucking brilliant man and really, really smart and but like really interesting. Take something like very hard liner. Hard line for science pro GMO plants. Pro Gmo. Yeah. Pro Genetically Modified Foods. Saying there's no evidence that it's, it's bad pro pharmaceutical companies because they produce good things like antidepressants and anti chemical anti alliance thing that goes a little too far sometimes aren't terrible aspirins. Awesome. She, but she was a very sensitive person and that's what would the interesting thing was that she was just very sensitive person who has this sort of hard line like defense when it comes to science.

Speaker 1:          02:05:31       But then other than that, she was like talking about like, she would never hurt a person if someone's coming to attack or she thinks she would just not defend herself. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. I found that really fascinating. I'm like, that's, that's, that's really, it's really interesting that uh, people like, um, that they think about things completely alien and different than the way you would, or I would or I am fascinated by different people's ways of, uh, of navigating life, especially smart people. You know, how they, how they look at the whole thing. Like there's a lot, like I make fun of Vegans, but there's a lot to being a Vegan that seems to me to represent someone is trying to rise above the most ruthless aspects of being a human being. That consumption of other living animals when they come down to like, it's unlike the cruelty to animals and looking nothing to argue with there.

Speaker 1:          02:06:20       Yeah. No way that you can't overlook. So for my enjoyment for this animal cruelty is a sign of human cruelty. It's a sign of accepted depravity. Like you can get away with it because you're not doing it to a person. Yeah. But this is the same muscle that makes you stab a dog over and over again with a pencil that'll make you do that to a person you're, you're a sick fuck or something wrong with you. You know? And I think the idea of being a Vegan, and I was like a really, I think it's a very powerful idea. Yeah. I see where they're all coming from. Is that like eventually we have to address the fact that we're, we're not going to stay the way we are now. Just like we didn't stay the way we were when our great, great, great ancestors were single celled organisms.

Speaker 1:          02:07:06       You know, the idea is that life started out as single cell organisms and wasn't like monkeys just fell out of trees. Okay. They, they'd had to develop to get to that point. Well, if that's the case and we look at where human beings are right now, we will look at this sort of new sentiment that we want to take care of the earth. We want to be green, we want to, we want to not eat meat and we want to, you know, be kind to be vegetarians. Like it seems like that that is the way that they believe that human being will evolve. It will evolve. Yeah. If you led to look at, if you had extrapolate, if you are completely objective, if you weren't a person at all and you had to say, well, how do you think they're, what, what? There's also, there's different possibilities of how we could fuck it up and go the wrong way, but if we weren't going to move forward and become really kind of passionate, what do we look up to him?

Speaker 1:          02:07:56       Characteristics of person. Yeah, and if you, if you did create an entirely vegan culture, you would have most likely a much more friendly openminded kind culture. If no one was killing animals, it sounds fucked up because you've got way more shit done. Yeah. You're just focused on learning and producing things and I think you would have way less do shit. I mean, it sounds like a silly thing to say because I'm not a Vegan and I love meat and I'm total hypocrite here, but I'm just saying, I'm not looking at it as a me. I'm looking at it as a PR on the mind. Yeah. I'm, I'm a, I'm a mind observing an organism. I could see how we could go totally the wrong way and some wacky dude in Pakistan could decide to blow up some wacky dude in India and then shit gets crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:08:40       I could see that happen and I could see someone in some part of the world that really needs a hug, just completely fucking up everything cause no one's to prepared for. Or I could see it man, if, if nine 11 could have happened and it did happen. So we know it could have happened. If something like that can happen, other crazy shit can happen. And I know that people are working hard to stop other crazy shit from happening, but the people working just to make it happen. Yeah. So you can't, oh well this and this is not necessarily the way the human race is going to go. Like the human race might just fuck itself up, but if it doesn't fuck itself up, you got to think that that is one option for elevating the consciousness. Like getting to a point where we no longer need to kill anything.

Speaker 1:          02:09:21       The problem with that as predators, I mean they have Nile crocodiles now in Florida, that's a new new threat or started killing them. They have, yeah, they have a kill on site or the Nile crocodiles. But now, I mean, look at how big the fucking everglades are. So you've got to go through the everglades and you've got to find the forest rangers. Yeah. And they have to have guns and just look for these crocodiles. And so far they haven't established a breeding population that they know off, but they are fine to start breeding them. It's fucked. It's out of control. Fucked. We're fucked. If they start breeding were there, people are going to die. Dogs are going to die. Alligators are going to die. They go kill, kill alligators. Like Nile crocodiles are enormous and they're super aggressive. They can be 20 plus feet long.

Speaker 1:          02:10:03       Whoa. Yeah. They're fucking huge. I think the world record was more than 20 feet long. I think there's a, there's a picture of a Nile crocodile in, um, in, uh, uh, I think it's, these are from Egypt at that area. It's Thailand or somewhere that they killed one of the largest crocodiles ever. See if you could pull that up, Brian. It's like if you look up largest crocodile ever, dude, there are giant and they're super, super aggressive and this one crocodile is responsible for the death of many villagers. Really. They were very excited when they track this fucking thing down and killed it. There are normal, yeah. The, I mean we can't even ratchet that up back underwater. You can't get them no way that they can go under water for hours. Yeah. They don't even have to pop up. They did. They don't have to breathe.

Speaker 1:          02:10:46       They can just stop their hearts. Basically. They dropped their heart rate to like almost nothing, but they kind of just has their eyes out the out the water. Yeah. And there's a way to have long snouts the difference between them and the, uh, the American alligator is big and a lot of people wanted to protect the alligator because alligators to a lot of people represented like some unique species that we just were lucky to be around and take a look at them. And for the most part, they're fairly harmless. It's good. You'd see him on a golf course. It fairly harmless, but they don't fucking kill people every now and then too, man. They kill dogs, you know, they, they fuck up. And you know, one guy was running from the cops in Florida and he, he ditched his car and jumped into the water and as he jumped in the water, the alligators attack them and ate them right in front of the cops.

Speaker 1:          02:11:30       Whoa. Yeah. They just fucking ripped him apart. They were right there. I think he just jumped and where he jumped, there was alligators right there. So as he hit the ground, I mean, they might've done it just to like for defense, like what's he mean? He, he just fucking pick the wrong spot to land. And the alligators took 'em out right in front of the cops. He was like, oh, like I think he stole a car or something like that. Yeah. So obliterated him right in front of the cops. Like in Indiana Jones when the guy falls. Yeah. Wow. Well, crocodiles will hunt you. That's the difference. What does that mean? That's one, but that's not the one largest crocodile killed. It's actual live crocodile skin. Where's that? That doesn't look like nothing. Go to go to Google images and they have less people. They captured it. What does the second one look at? The size of that fucking thing. That's real, but that's an alligator, I believe. Is there a crocodile? How many feet is it? Oh, 21 point 21 foot crocodile cheese. It's Christ, but that doesn't look like nothing compared to the one with the villagers. Just look up giant crock villagers on Google images and you'll see this insane fucking picture. It's these people have it all like tied up. I don't even know if it's dead yet.

Speaker 8:          02:12:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:12:45       And then what? It's just massive. I can't wait to see it.

Speaker 8:          02:12:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:12:50       Yeah, that's it. Look at the size of that thing.

Speaker 1:          02:12:56       These people were all gathered around this. There's several pictures of it. That's just one that got shot. The grown adult wing spanning it. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow. They're huge man. They're huge. Wow. He's barely on a little part of his back, by the way. All the people in these pictures are so black. Yeah, I think there. That's the Philippines, I think. Oh really? Yeah. I did a bit of exposure on that. I can't, I'm not sure that this thing is massive. There's a lot of places in the world where if you live there, man, you got to worry about sure. Much meet with that provider. Those people, I don't think they eat them. What? I think they just fucking, I don't think, what do you mean that the tiles? I don't think he crocodiles easy. That one right there,

Speaker 3:          02:13:31       Brian. Right above your cursor. Click on that. No, no, no. The other ones.

Speaker 5:          02:13:35       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:13:37       That one. Yeah. Click on that one.

Speaker 3:          02:13:40       Look at the size of that thing. Wow. It's on a damn. Well, look at his legs. His legs are bigger than those people. Yeah. The clock and I is bigger. The people fight over and look at the guy right over the middle. There's a perspective issue because we're not sure how far those people were from way back. They could be back a little bit to make the photo more impressive. That's most likely how it is. Because if you look at the left hand side where the mouth is open, those people don't look like they're under the mouth. So if they're the same size as those other people, that means they're all behind it and it makes it look more impressive, but it is fucking huge. Whatever it is. Okay. By the way, those were around when dinosaurs were, those are essentially living remnants of the Jurassic.

Speaker 3:          02:14:19       They get out of it. They just lived there just so bad ass. They survive, survive the plate. They probably ate everybody that died. You know, alligators could eat anything. Crocodiles can eat anything. They eat license plates. So eat your foot. We don't give a fuck. So the, the idea is that if they did that, if they just could eat anything, we've got no animals out here. Really? Huh? Or coyotes I guess. Okay. Mountain lions, ma'am. Oh yeah. Out here. Those are, those are legit. Yeah. I've been at, uh, fascinated by Alaska shows. Man. That's all I've been. Really. Yeah. All I've been watching lately is Alaska shows. I had a meeting recently yet a discovery channel. And we were talking about this show and one of talking about Alaska show us for like 10 minutes last cause awesome. I'm obsessed with these Alaska shows. What are the Alaska, they're subsistence shows.

Speaker 3:          02:15:03       It's all punched survive in Alaska. Yeah. Living in Alaska. And most of them they uh, they hunt, they catch fish and they smoke the fish. They grow their own vegetables and uh, they, you know, they have to fix their Alaska, the wilderness. Oh Dude, you just showed me this creek. They're like, look at that creek. It's beautiful. Like summertime's picturesque and it's flowing down this mountain. She goes, if you drank from that, you'll get immediate medical attention and you'll die within a day and a half. Wow. Like Montezuma's revenge was just everything of his shit and you can't stop it. Lie what's in it? Badger Shit. Whoa. Something like that. Badger droppings and it makes it completely, he said it tastes the same. Oh my God. Probably wasn't a day and I probably like a few days, but like, oh my God. Yeah. That's terrifying. Badger Shit. Yeah, that's all. It's just a little bag of shit in there.

Speaker 3:          02:15:50       And it makes it still tastes refreshing. Quenches your thirst. You have to know about that stuff if you go live there, right. Fuck yeah you do. Yeah. Fuck yeah. You did like water. Okay. I'll put it in a glass. I could see right through it. Yeah. Good badge or shit terminated. These shows. They um, like one of them, a guy died well while filming himself while they were filming him, he died. He, while they're filming his village, he was like one of the guys in the village, he fell. He uh, they take the snowmobiles out and they try, they crossed the river. The river is frozen, but sometimes they fall through into the river and you're fucked. Fucking that. Yeah, because you're, you're going with the current, like the, when you pole, you

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       don't stay put you, you start going down river and you're under the, you're going to have to swim your way back to the hole and get back up all while you're freezing and your muster shutting down. Cause they're all still, everything's shutting down. You can't breathe. You can't believe how much it constricts your body's ability to utilize oxygen. It's like immediate, like the cold water. It's like a constrictor. Everything tightens up. It's very hard to survive. Amazed by that shit. When you talk about your body and in terms of like a machine or it just, it does it to this and we can't process oxygen. If you're too cold, that's what it is. Your body shuts down. This is terrible feeling. We can't your, your lungs like clamp down and even though you're holding your breath like you're fucked, you're like, oh my God, I can't do this very long.

Speaker 1:          02:17:10       Oh yeah. There's all the oxygen that you're holding onto. It's going out of your system rapidly. You can break the ice because every time you break it, you're going to have to just go, you're not going to break the ice, you know? No Way. No Way. You're going to have to get back to that whole, you're going to have to get out of your time to start spotting. He's not coming back. Wow. That's what happens to those guys. Yeah. Some guys on the show had told similar stories and said that they survived. It's wait who died on the show? One of the guys that was in [inaudible]. Yeah, he was on the jet ski or Snowmobile and uh, he was doing this thing they do when the ice is starting to thaw, they take chances and they go across the river. They have to like, if they have like traps, did they show that to show him, show him fall?

Speaker 1:          02:17:49       They weren't there. They had, they showed them, they showed everybody looking for him and then everybody finding out that he was dead. And then they showed a, they have this, what they do is they like life and death is like so normal out there. And these people, they have like things that they do as a community when someone dies because it happened in ceremony. Ritual. Yeah. It's called a potlatch and they, uh, they're allowed to shoot a moose out of season for this, this, uh, this ceremony. Yeah. So this guy goes, yeah. Even though it wasn't a hunting season for Moose, he goes out, finds a moose, shoots it, and that's like the law. You're allowed to do that if someone dies. And so they're getting back and they cook Moose head soup. That's like the big thing that they do for this. How it's fascinating man.

Speaker 1:          02:18:30       And these people that live there, I mean technically they're supposed to be, that's supposed to be America technically, but it's clearly not American wilderness. It's, it's absolutely cons that were there. Yes. It was all settled by people that were like ex cons or running away from a jealous boyfriend, shit like that. Like I'll relocate to Alaska. No one will find me or James Your name. There's small towns that are in the middle of nowhere that our homestead towns, what does that mean? It means that people came there and some of them from other countries, they came there and they said, let's try to to make any, you're like one of the guys, I believe their, their family was from Sweden and they were worried about the Nazis taking over the world. So they left Europe 80 years ago, went to this place in Alaska and started this homestead and they, you know when you homestead out there they give you like a certain amount of acres and like I think yeah, I think they were offering like land to people. If you could live on it. And they were trying to like get people to, to live in certain

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       areas and they, they did that in Montana where, uh, we're Brian Cowen, I went hunting. There's a lot of these really old homestead sites. We see these old broken down frames of a house. And it's so fascinating because like you're walking around inside of this old broken down house and like this is where someone decided they were going to try to live part of the wilderness. Yep. And there's no roof on it anymore. It's completely fallen apart and it's probably 300 years old, you know? Yeah. I mean it's old as fuck that places a strange, strange place. No repairs onto it. Oh No, there's nothing there. Well, there's a difference. So what happens is people died out or they all left the left. There's different states of disrespect, disrepair. There's some of them that looked like, you know, if you put a little money until you could actually turn it into a little log house.

Speaker 3:          02:20:17       And there's other ones that are just nothing left. But you're worried they're going to follow that up around around you? No, no. The wind, the one that I stepped into, there was nothing left on the roof. There's no roof left. Oh. So it was just like some boards and some, some, uh, it was obviously made out of logs that they had a sound Nazi house out here somewhere. It's a hike to it, but it's what these people went to. It was like Americans like left [inaudible] they assume Hillary's going to win really until they just went to wait until it happens because they thought they were gonna be too many reprisals. There's like Nazi a lovers. Whoa. Until then, so those, wait until Taylor takes over and then eventually left. And so where are they now? They're all gone. I don't know. They came back to America.

Speaker 3:          02:20:54       There's an Indian place near here. It's an Indian house. I think they use it for like weddings and shit. Like it's like a big, nice, beautiful place. It's got swastikas all over it really? Yeah. Yeah. And we talked about this yesterday apparently. Is that sticky? No, no, no. Nothing to do with the Nazis. It used to be, it's like an ancient Hindu symbol. Oh yeah. Way, way, way, way back. I read a book about what the swastika means. Different cultures of good luck and good things. Nazi's ruined it. Plus they ruined that mustache option. They've ruined it bad. It's amazing that that, that one shitty dude could ruin Jordan's doing this stash option. Sort of. He's got a little goatee going on, so really? Yeah, but it also shows his arrogance that he was trying to pull off the Hitler. I can't like the area cool anymore.

Speaker 3:          02:21:38       Well, it's like someone said to him like, man, you can't pull off the Hitler. It was like, motherfucker, I can pull it might hit Jordan. I'm like, well, why else would he want to? He can't think that it looks good. Anything you can do, I can do better. People only thought that looked good before photos. Once photos came along and they saw that mustache, they're like, what the fuck am I doing? Hitler? That kind of the whole growth further when and go further, judge, see this shit your websites out? Oh, it's up. So that's what it's all for sale. This is all the new website. This is my new website. Yeah, it's uh, I got to send some videos to them, but the meter put up here, there, it was never really that. I see a lot of people with your tee shirts at, at my comedy shows. Yeah. A lot. Cause Death Squad tee shirts. There's tire primary t shirts. He, the primary teachers who got

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       this new one, the best design ever one that uh, Mike Maxwell did. It's fucking awesome. I had a vision inside my tank really to be told him and he, I told someone he recreated it to a t. It's perfect. It's a monkey or a chimp rather. And he's got two open palms. One Palm is a floating home on the other palm. The word home. No, no, no. I'm like an and ancient Tibetan writing. The symbol of you ever seen the symbol for home and the other hand has this um, uh, the atomic symbol, the symbol for atomic energy and he's got his mouth open and there's a mushroom on his tongue and his third eyes got like, like geometric designs coming off. It looks dope. Mike Maxwell [inaudible] that one is a red, red and black or a white and black. But uh, I like it's one of those, is that the color of the Monitor? That's pink?

Speaker 3:          02:23:22       Is that your monitor? You got your fucking no colors all out of whack on your mind. Oh, like he wasn't doing that. But did you do that on purpose? That would actually look cool and pink. It's funny that one color became like bad for completely color is not, it's not like dolls or anything. You could say we're like, no, men just don't want to play with those. It's a color, but like

Speaker 1:          02:23:43       yellow is probably more weak. Like bright yellow is probably more weak than, than pink, isn't it? Like at least pink looks cool when you mix it with black. It does. I have picking my shirt. What's wrong with pink?

Speaker 3:          02:23:58       Nothing should be wrong with it. Everybody agreed. You know that pink layer, we all agree that pink corvette chick that lives around here that I see, it's uh, there's this girl that lives in Los Angeles is not a girl or [inaudible] name is Angelina superfood that you've seen around here. Just kind of crazy. And which she used to do crazy take out billboards. Yeah. And no one knew. I mean this is when I first moved here in 94. She had been doing it for decades. So when I moved I was like, what is this? But go ahead. Nobody understood what it was like when you first come. Here you go, what is this? When you see these billboards and says Angelina on it, it's her and she's very voluptuous.

Speaker 1:          02:24:28       She's like, uh, you know, in front of a car or something like that, you know, in her underwear. And then it says like management call and uh, you'll spot her around town because she wears, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:24:39       she has a clothing paint, white corvette and Angelina on the back. And what's crazy is that I see her all the time and it's like, just shows you how small la is. Even though it's big. I see her all the time. Yeah, I've seen her at least 10 times over the [inaudible] driving by the same people a lot. You don't notice, right?

Speaker 3:          02:25:00       Yeah, no shit. Cause I see her. Did you see her and took a picture of her? Is this, you know, this isn't me, but this is a, she is old now. Oh yeah. And she puts a picture of, she's running for president. Right. Let me just hit it. I was married. I still hit it. I mean if you weren't married Jesus to say you hit the corvette, I would break and she would die. She would die for sure. Do you want to go easy on her death? You, it wouldn't even know what you're saying. The doors, the likes. I really don't even know what you're saying. All right. Would you hit that? What'd you hit that? Yeah. All right. We're looking at that picture. Yeah, that's not what I know what she looks like up close. You would have to be on ketamine. There's no way you would fuck that. She be supplying the ketamine. She's Jakey grandmother and I'm not joking. I bet she's a nice lady, but she's a, she was old in 1990 when, uh, when I first came here, that was like this weird thing because the photos didn't look anything like her. What if she's done any video she had? What's, how does she make her money? She married a rich dude.

Speaker 3:          02:26:02       Yeah. That's a fucking 20 years old and she looks 90. There's her dude. I bet that is her. Wow. Is that really an old picture of her? Is that legit? Maybe it's just a fucking road. I think I was just a pink corvette. Oh, okay. Yeah. I don't know what the deal with her is, but uh, how bad, she's a nice lady. Someone's taking pictures with her just with your thing. Oh, I see. I would, I mean, just for boobs alone, I'd probably, okay though. Imagine if that girl imagine. Okay, the way. Move Up. Move Up. That's your vagina coming out. Brian started leaking out vagina. No, go back down to catches. That's a vagina coming out and down. No, that's, yes. That's below the skirt line where it's too close. Where it's happening.

Speaker 3:          02:26:55       Yeah. You know what? Have some respect for this old lady. Why Zoom in our snatch? He looks pretty cute. Yeah, but this is not really what she looks like. She's a nice old lady, I'm sure. But you know the, the the sexy image not aging gracefully. Yeah. That's sexy. Image is, it becomes a monstrous. That's what's weird. It's amazing. Yeah. Like there she is like look, this is like a really, that's sounds like something, he's an elderly lady. That's what I was telling a joke or were due to you make it look like that. I look at his legs. That's nice legs for an old lady. When her body looks great, if she would cut down on the silicone in her breasts. She's proud to be a lot better luck than oil that turn off the lights a little like a certain look that you can only pull off.

Speaker 3:          02:27:37       You know when you're so her rich husband just lets her just wanting, I don't pay for billboards. I'm just making shit up husband. Why are you sad? That's what I heard that tried to crash that party. Does she make money off? That was the rumor. The rumor was that her husband had a, it was a, but it's like she's like an la, an La celebrity. I can tell you where they live at. Tito's Tacos like dentists were roof. What are you talking about? Tito's Tacos. It's another La commercial thing. I have no idea what that is. You love to hear those two key on there. We're watching late night TV. You always had cable, Huh? Yeah, I always had cable. Tito's Tacos. Tito's Tacos. He has key from Van Nuys.

Speaker 3:          02:28:28       When I was a kid in New York, it was crazy. Eddie, do you remember crazy? Eddie crazy? Eddie has prices are insane. Crazy Gideon blog. There's a bunch of crazy guys, but crazy. Eddie was really, his prices are insane and crazy. Eddie wound up having to go to, um, I think he went to Israel. That was crazy. Gideon. Crazy. Eddie did too. Dude or crazy and he went to jail. Let's see. Cause he had, he didn't benefit from being part of the Jewish people so he couldn't leave. And it was crazy Gideon from, I thought he was in New York to here. I know knowing of these crazy guys I don't hang out with. Well it was like they were the famous guys back in the days that were selling like, like TV's and shit. That's how they got famous. I always want you to pay cash. Like there was a furniture company, two brothers, um, in Boston and they were the, uh, they were like famous.

Speaker 3:          02:29:18       I remember somebody that, one of my sister's friends because of the commercial new one of the kids and it was like a big deal. Like, Oh, her dad is that guy from the fucking furniture commercial. And like everybody was all excited at this dude from the furniture commercial was a, you know, like his kid was like in the neighborhood. Like what? He's only on a commercial cause he paid for commercial talk. Exactly. But they became, yeah. Okay. Founder of crazy. Eddie gets eight years in prison and big fine. Really? Yeah, he's from, uh, he's actually from 1971 so it wasn't for what? I think 1971. It's probably, he probably predates crazy Gideon. Oh yeah. Crazy. Gideon's around now. Oh yeah. That's crazy. Gideon is a fucking hack. Yeah. He probably sold everything from crazy Yeti. He falsified the chains books. He falsified the, the businesses books and he fleed the country to avoid prosecution.

Speaker 3:          02:30:12       Which one was this crazy. Eddie at the prices are insane. In November of 1987 crazy Eddie stockholders took over the chain and discovered a $45 million inventory shortage. What? The chain never recovered. That dude must have been [inaudible] $45 million out of the company town. Something. God never heard of it. You know, he didn't play the, I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear him. Stop. Look at this commercial though. That just the, uh, Tito's Tacos class. Yeah. It's the funniest shit ever loose. I got a hot check. He was that guy. It's like Douche bags. He's there just dated Culver city. That's right. They have the twin douchebag dudes. What's that message? Echo things out because it's more relaxing now. It's so weird. Stupid stuff. Doing that son of a bitch. It makes it unique. So crazy. Gideon is like a new, see what his deal was. Eddie flipped as a where to Eddie fleet too. He fleed to Jerusalem and we did know cage good.

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       The own. I wonder if the crazy getting was, it was a, just a figment of the board's imagination. Gideon's closed in downtown La.

Speaker 1:          02:31:30       Maybe just went out of business. Did he die? I don't know. Trying to find out. Does it give you on, I'll give you the best prices. [inaudible] TV. I crazy. How do you spell Gideon? Gee, I. D. E. O. N. Yeah. That's how I spelled it. Just as crazy Gideon's closed. It doesn't say anything about him. Crazy. Gideon is crazy. Oh, okay. He went to jail for tax evasion. That's hilarious. They always ask you to only pay cash. That's hilarious. And Gideon's a Jewish name. Yeah. He, uh, he followed any of that God's footsteps completely. Yeah, pretty much, man. Wow. Talking about blazing a trail.

Speaker 16:         02:32:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:32:11       Embraces insanity and turn it on to an advertising ploy. This is a real commercial that aired on local television and Gideon is a role model for us all. Uh, okay. I don't know what they're trying to say. It was trying to talk too much about the video is yeah, I don't know what the fuck that some, some takes on this are saying that it might be actually they're talking about crazy Eddie. Oh really?

Speaker 3:          02:32:36       Crazy. Eddie went to jail for um, that wasn't tax evasion. What was he? I believe the murder or please say murder, please say no. No, no. Crazy. Eddie was the one who stole the 43 million or so high. You don't remember shit we were talking about. That was a four minute ago. That was like at least a full minute. I can tell you the same story three or four times in a row before he got mad at me right now. It's a story about,

Speaker 1:          02:32:59       uh, okay. TMZ says he's out crazy. Eddie TMZ has a crazy Gideon video. How crazy is crazy Gideon as he worth listening to? Maybe he's looks sort of Weirdo. No, probably not. Legendary television salesmen. Crazy Gideon is back and still packing so much crazy. He inspired a brand new, poorly dressed, loud mouth pitch, man. Huh? Let's not him. I don't know. I've got Brian to be, as I say, guy new, pitch them in to do it. I don't understand what the fuck they're saying and I'm not willing to click their links. Sons of bitches. You led me on a more electronic salesman. Why don't even know their names. Unsatisfied

Speaker 3:          02:33:42       buying. Why? Well, because back in the day, that was like a good way to get someone to go to your place. Can you make yourself a celebrities on van eyes? Just that you know, having something that was like a good jingle. That shit's important. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:33:56       How many good jangles we should have a jingle. Brian, what would our jingle be? Oh God,

Speaker 3:          02:34:03       no. That's your jingle. You've got, hold on. What's your deal with the olive garden? What's, where's this all come from and make it a hit song? No. Where does the thing, with the exception of obsession with this play, are you trying to question and what you know is broken? Why are you looking at the glass and say in class, why are you broken? Why are you doing that? You know, that's just his thing, man. Yeah, you got to accept to dude, Sarah came out of nowhere. Black chicks. He's, look, he's a mess obviously, but that mess lends itself to create things and that aren't funny. But when you say them a million times, they suddenly become funny. But why? Why Olive Garden? Whatever. Why not do you get, it could be anything. It could be anything. It could be converse. All stars, converse, all stars could be the number one sneaker for death squad. We could all decide that converse all stars or red talk about converse. All stars constantly. And this motherfucker will bring up Kai. Did you get there and your converse all stars. That's what he would do. He would do that until my wife, my head explode because he's crazy. That's just crazy. Got his crazy. You got your crazy. I got mine.

Speaker 3:          02:35:11       I ask why? Why s why Joey Diaz gets mad about mayonnaise. Yeah. Try try to give him ranch dressing, you know, kick you in the dig. I've seen so many of those t shirts at that shows it's blue cheese with wings or go fuck your mother. He went and sold t shirts and said that blue cheese like go fuck your mother responsible for two of the greatest quotes in human history. Fuck Shakespeare. If you ain't high by two 8:02 PM, go fuck yourself. I like that. That where that comes from. Just an overall feeling. People looking at you negatively and just turning around. No, fuck. You die by two in the afternoon. You're the file itself. That olive garden's song is actually a German band. Uh, covered it and remade it and sold it on a CD. All of Germany, but funnel what? Olive Garden's song that the Olive Garden Song I wrote and then they read. I didn't know you wrote an olive oil. Yeah, it's huge. I don't want to hear about it. It's not huge right now. Listen to the German stop it. No [inaudible] little bit German band singing about olive garden. They recovered my song.

Speaker 5:          02:36:14       It's crazy. It's like all heavy metal rock. Do you know the band? Yeah, I think it. They ask permission to sell the song and I'm like, Oh yeah, sure. Totally bought us. Hilarious. You can be like David, you can hear me in it when you can hear the garden here. Yeah. It's too hard to

Speaker 3:          02:36:57       say when he's saying, but funnels the name German band. I'm sure that guy is not crazy. It's not like he has a real doll with your face tape to it that he fucks violently every night. Here's what they look like. Look at this. This is the band red band on, but funnel these. This is the band that does not look like. I look at this guy on the right it looks like. Wow. Well listen folks, I'm sure your podcast fans, so I don't want to be make it funny, too hard. I love those guys, but I need you guys to move on with your life. Are Those real people? That's my funnel. Does that thing not loose? Is that loose? Ari? [inaudible] this thing up here won't be also wiggly on Ya. What? 10 minutes? 10 minutes? Well, this fucking podcast is overlays and gentlemen. It's been a fun one.

Speaker 3:          02:37:46       Wobbly. Ben, tighten that shit down. So on. You're driving me it all away. You can't figure it out. You don't know what the fuck is this one? Yeah, that's what I said. This podcast has been brought to you by many things. Ladies and gentlemen. Ari shaffir.com that's s h, a f, F I r, early ants in the background. You know what? That is false. That's Ari's old CD. It's new, but it's old because he's already taping a new one. You fucking freaks and you should be there. It's going to be in Brooklyn. Flat out like, Hey guys, that's not gonna help when, um, December 28th, December 28th. Where's it at again? The knitting factory in Brooklyn and Brooklyn. And you get street credit for doing it in Brooklyn. That went through my mind. Street cred. I'm just looking for a name. Yeah, that's a good way to do it.

Speaker 3:          02:38:36       You are a name now? No, no, no. I'm looking for a name of it, what does it, but on that subject, it is kind of strange that you went from being a guy who had a hard time getting booked to a guy who's not just headlining but selling out clubs all over the place, all over the country and in Canada. And it happened like of that, the guy who worked with in a, in Minnesota, it was like, oh, it's good. You know, you get booked somewhere. It's a future. Like I hope it's not just some like, uh, yeah, it's nice that you can draw people. And I'm like, Oh yeah, we're going to have to come. Yeah. Like instantly you went from that terrible spot where you can't get booked and you're trying to take shitty gigs because you need to work and you know, you really, it's really unsatisfying.

Speaker 3:          02:39:16       It's like that I couldn't even take gigs. There were no gigs to take tomatoes. I was like, I'll go for whatever the little you want to pay me, just let me perform at your place. Yeah. And it's all just because already really kind of stuck to his guns with like the kind of material that he likes and that kind of material. You fucking can't get on TV with it. So it's, it's, it's hard. It's hard for you to get those credits. It's hard to get that my mind a while ago. Yeah. It's almost like it's impossible. It's, it's, and what people don't understand is there's a real stigma attached in the world of standup comedy to like dirty acts and dirty jokes. It's like you're thought to be like a lesser version of it. Do you think it's because you can't get onto these, they have to justify why or why you get around when it was, is that, yeah. If you were trying to get on television, like say if you were trying to do it tonight, show set, but all your, yeah, just jokes about cut farts. You're, you're not going to get off. You can, I mean you, you might be able to kill at the, you know, the, the Framingham Howard Johnson's know whatever the fuck has a comedy residence inn. Yeah. But what you're not

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       going to do is you're not going to get on the tonight show would can't fart jokes. So those guys all wanted to get on a tonight show. Everybody wanted to do what happened to Steven Steven right before Steven riding in. There's a great documentary on it by this guy, France Sala Meta and it's um, it's about, uh, Boston comedy and it's um, dammit. I should, uh, I should Google this friend's solemn Meta. I forget the name of it, but it's all about, uh, what is it about Boston and how it changed how the scene, how the scene change after Steven Wright got on television because then the value is placed on being able to do the stuff that you'd get on TV. Yeah, exactly. So they're a lot more like one liner comics after that. Um, no, it's like guys tried to clean it up a lot because they saw that if he got on some night show, he got success.

Speaker 1:          02:41:00       Oh, I can get on the tonight show. Yeah, success. That was the, that was the whatever the catalyst know to success was you had to get on the tonight show back then. So, uh, that's what everybody was trying to do. So when I started doing stand up, it was already when people had found out about the, you know, the possibility of becoming famous because Steven Wright was famous like stint when stand up. Sit Out. That's the name of it. Steven Wright was, it's really good. It's really good. It's a brilliant piece. Um, Steven Wright was the first guy to go from the tonight show. Like he was huge. All of a sudden, like he did, like they saw him and they were like, Holy Shit. Is this guy good? And from being on television, they're like completely turned whatever it was. It was Letterman or to the sign shop, whatever it was.

Speaker 1:          02:41:48       They completely transformed this guy's life. And so all these other guys that were in town, they saw that too. And they definitely saw, started doing comedy that leaned towards that. The problem was like if you're not doing that kind of comedy, you don't have a lot of options because that's all that's on television and people think that it's clever because you do have to think more because you have to avoid certain areas and subjects, but it's not more clever. It's just less funny. You know? Oftentimes the, the idea that you're only doing this because these corporations want you to, that's not the way you would naturally tell jokes if you want it to. Yeah, exactly. The rules on you and you're not doing what you would do. I always loved that you did that, man. You really never fucking, and the one time you got to television, you pulled you dick out.

Speaker 1:          02:42:34       They told you don't pull your dick out and you're like, Yup, okay. You just let me know where, where am I standing? The Andrew said it was just don't get naked. And then the light bulb went off in my house and that was perfect. It's perfect because it was fun as a lot of it dirty. I went further than I was because it was funny and it's funny and you pull your Dick out. What's funny and what's Your Dick? What do they kind of let it, let it come on and we really, well, we were little children, man. We're, we're little children. A grown man can't pull his dick out. Who were you watching this with? If you're watching it with your wife, are you truly offended by this guy pulling his dick out? You can't just laugh at that. When it comes at midnight on a Friday on an HBO and after Jim Norton's been about trainees for an hour and a half that you really freaking out because this guy pulls his dick out. Dick cyst. But I love the fact that you, you stood up for logic, you know, your entire career. He never really gave in.

Speaker 7:          02:43:24       I'm telling you, I saw you this one time at that I thought voting place in Rhode Island. It set it, set it free a little bit with that guy was like, do you remember that we, we took a trip to chicken and then to Rhode Island chicken. It was horrible.

Speaker 7:          02:43:38       Um, but the Rhode Island that we get out, we're walking to this big yachting club and he goes, just so you know, the, the crowd's a little more conservative here, so you might wanna try to keep it clean a little bit. And he didn't even get, he just said like that's how far he got. And you were just like, no. And then just turn right back and kept walking. Like, just get off me nat. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:43:56       No silly man. Whoever you are, I don't know who you are, but you didn't, you don't get to having creative control over what goes on up there. Those people, they don't see me. I know what I'd do. Exactly. Yeah. That's what it was. But it's like, oh, you know what you're doing here. Yeah. Silly Bitch. They, they didn't really apply to you. They didn't go to that show because they didn't know what was going to happen. They went to that show because they knew what I was doing, getting offended. So what, they live in a nice neighborhood. I live in a nice neighborhood too. So a blow job when they were in high school and by the time [inaudible] we almost had a time. So that was going on. By the time Diaz went up the all the fucking, they'll taboos have been crushed like grapes anyway.

Speaker 1:          02:44:33       Like that guy had to like hope and pray that I wasn't as dirty as Diaz. Diaz didn't.
