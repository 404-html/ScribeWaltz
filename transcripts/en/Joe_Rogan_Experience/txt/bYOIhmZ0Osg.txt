Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Move over a little bit. I seem right. Three, two, one.

Speaker 1:          00:00:08       Yes. Alright, welcome back Chris. What's up man? How's. Thanks. Happy to be here. Things are good. How many have you? Yeah. What's the latest and the greatest view? A new book came out yesterday. That's always a big one. What's called a unconventional medicine. And uh, give us the, what is it, what are those sheets? The back sheet called to the. Yeah, the backseat not works. Um, the biggest challenge we face today is chronic disease and conventional medicine has failed to address it. So we need a new system. That's the nutshell. And you're essentially, I'm doing nutrition based, uh, for the three components, ancestral diet and lifestyle, which we've talked about, a functional medicine and a collaborative practice model that incorporates health coaches, nutritionists, and other allied providers to, to offer more support to patients. What does that mean when you say functional medicine? So the easiest way to understand it, it is, it's an approach that is geared towards addressing the underlying cause of a problem instead of just suppressing the symptoms.

Speaker 1:          00:01:13       So you go into the doctor, you've got a high cholesterol, usually given a drug to lower it statens. Yup. You got high blood pressure and those are devastating your health, right? Statens or. Well, you know, for some people they can be. I wouldn't say they're devastating for everybody and they do save lives in certain situations. But the idea that they're the first thing we, we would do in that situation. That's what's off that. You wouldn't suggest like altering the diet. Exactly. Let's look at why the cholesterol is high in the first place. Same thing with high blood pressure. You go into the doctor, high blood pressure, you get a drug to lower it, there's rarely any investigation and your blood pressure is high. And what are the main factors that high cholesterol? Because I know that um, it's a big part of it is hereditary.

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       Yeah, right. Genetics play a huge role. Yeah. So the genetics is one for sure. Uh, but then you have things like poor thyroid function can actually lead to high cholesterol or Ldl particle number. You've got infections can do that. Like h Pylori, which is the bacteria that causes ulcer a, you've got leaky gut. Intestinal permeability has been shown to do that. That's interesting that you did you talk about this before, but a lot of people are not aware of that, that there's actually gut bacteria that causes ulcers. Yeah. Yeah. There's a. it's a. it's a cool story actually, so you know, 20, 30 years ago that the dominant idea was ulcers were caused by stress and things like eating spicy foods and a couple of Australian physicians presented at a conference. This notion that, no, actually they're caused by this bacteria called helicobacter pylori, and they were literally laughed off the stage.

Speaker 1:          00:02:50       Nobody took them seriously. They were ridiculed and they kept going. I kept doing this research, kept trying to present this idea and nobody take them seriously. Finally, one of them swallowed a vial of, have a solution that had the bacterium in, in, in it, developed an ulcer as a result, and then treated himself with antibiotics and got rid of the ulcer to approve this is how committed this guy was, this idea and proving this. And finally at that point people started to pay attention, but it's still was another 10 years before that theory was widely accepted and then they eventually won the Nobel prize in medicine as a result of that discovery. So that, to me, that's a great example of how group think is such a problem in medicine. You know, we have a tendency to just like get stuck on the status quo, even though a core principle of sciences uncertainty, you know, like we don't, we, we come up with a hypothesis.

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       We have to be willing to challenge our most cherished views all the time. Um, because if we look at the history of science, it was the history of most people being wrong about most things most of the time. Yeah. And it's amazing how many people are still operating under information that has been updated many times over the past couple of decades. But absolutely talk to the average person about what you should eat. I mean they're looking at like the food pyramid from the Dr Seuss books. Really? Yeah. Or another one is you probably saw some articles like stents have. They don't work. Yeah. I just read that just came out with they don't work, but there's still a massively being used in part because they get a doctors get paid for that now. That's crazy because I thought a stent was like, I thought it propped open the artery. I mean what does it do?

Speaker 1:          00:04:35       Right. And, but the question is, does that actually have the desired effect? I mean the thing was based on pain resident, wasn't it? And mammograms prevent, we're supposed to prevent breast cancer. They don't. Then we saw the huge randomized controlled trial that showed that not only did they not prevent breast cancer, they may actually increase death either as a result of unnecessary treatments that come from the mammogram. So yeah. How, how would you get an unnecessary trip? Like if you did a mammogram and you saw a lump, well it's not always black or white, so it could be a cyst or something unless somebody gets unnecessary treatment and that lends that leads to an adverse event. So I'm just saying it's, you know, we got to be humble and realize that we don't always have the answers and that in 10 years it's going to look really different than it does now.

Speaker 1:          00:05:24       Just like a hundred years ago, everybody thought they had the answers and you know, we look back on them and we say how silly, you know, but we forget that people are 100 years ahead are going to look back on us with that same. You know, that they're going to shake their heads. Yeah. It's very unfortunate. But that is a tendency that people have when they've been living their life based on what they think is like certain rigid information. Like this is absolute, this is true. And they've been teaching that. That's when it gets especially problematic or writing books about that. Yeah. And then they just never want to admit that their book is bullshit and I think the, our education system needs to change medical education because you know, you write a textbook and that takes a long time and then, you know, the textbook is used in, in, in chorus, like the medical schools are still using the nutrition textbooks that were probably written in the seventies, the eighties or something. And then we get all these new studies showing that like cholesterol in the Diet makes, has no impact on your blood cholesterol for most people.

Speaker 2:          00:06:23       Say that again, because for a lot of people who live like, what did he just say?

Speaker 1:          00:06:27       Yeah. So, uh, even the American standard us diet guidelines last year, a lot of people might've missed this. They completely removed any restriction on dietary cholesterol from the, from the US diet guidelines. They basically said there's no reason to limit cholesterol in your diet anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:06:47       Now for people who don't know why this is so crazy or how this came to be, you need to go to the New York Times article on how the sugar industry bribe scientists and convinced scientists to publish faulty or false information pointing toward saturated fats and cholesterol as being the cause of heart disease and heart attacks and all these different elements so that they could push the blame away from sugar and I think they only got paid something like $50,000 to do it. Yeah. Well, she's amazing when you think about how many people that's affected.

Speaker 1:          00:07:22       Yeah. And these, I mean, these conflicts of interest are everywhere. It's a big topic of interest. I mean, that's just, that's just crime, right? But it's horrible things to people. It totally, you know, it's unfortunately pretty normal in medicine. There was a study that just came out a few days ago that showed that the more gifts doctors receive from pharmaceutical companies, the more expensive the drugs they prescribe and the more prescriptions they write in general. Yeah, I would imagine that's true. Um, my wife's mom was a nurse and she would tell me stories about how they would take them out to nice dinners at fancy restaurants and everything on the house. And it's human nature. I mean, you know, up to one of my favorite quotes is from Upton Sinclair. He said it's difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary is dependent on him not understanding it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:11       That's a great quote. Yeah. So one more time, dietary cholesterol has no impact. Yeah. Well, I'll be more specific. So in 70 percent of people eating egg yolks and cholesterol and meat and other things doesn't do anything to your serum cholesterol. The cholesterol levels in your blood, in 30 percent of people, you'll get a slight raise in your ldl cholesterol, the so called bad cholesterol, but you also get a raise in your hdl cholesterol, which is a so called good cholesterol, which means there's no net clinical impact of that in terms of your risk of heart disease. And this is why the US finally the last industrialized country to actually do this. They finally said, okay, well we really just can't do this anymore. We can't tell you not to eat dietary cholesterol because there's just not any evidence to support that. What took so long?

Speaker 1:          00:09:07       Well, I think you just referred to one of the reasons, you know, conflicts of interest, people that were invested in maintaining the status quo. I think also there's probably some concern about losing credibility, you know, these organs, these government organizations, if they told you, told us not to eat cholesterol for so long and then they tell us that we can and it's not a problem and they do that with saturated fat. You know, people stop listening because they just throw up their hands. They're like, I don't know who to believe or what to listen to. That saturated fat is another one. You talked to the average person. They think you should restrict your intake of saturated fat. Yeah, average person. Most doctors still. And, um, you know, I, I think, I think there is some nuance here and, and you know, maybe we talked about this on the last show, but where we're headed in my opinion with diet and nutrition recommendations is from general blanket recommendations that apply to everybody to more personalized recommendations that depend on your genetics, your goals, your lifestyle, you know, uh, your health status, your age, etc.

Speaker 1:          00:10:11       So let's take somebody who is apo e four, four, which is a, you know, have a certain genetic haplotype and they have a, you know, they're, they're, they are really sensitive to the dietary effects of saturated fat if you have that gene type and if they eat the common, is that not very common at all? Um, I, I can't remember the exact percent. It'S below 10 percent. I think it's three point three, four percent or something like that. And if those people eat a lot of saturated fat, their ldl particle number, which we can define if you want to, those are the particles that carry cholesterol can go up pretty pretty quickly. And what we know, at least from the research that we have is that people who have a much higher ldl particle number can be at higher risk for heart disease and alzheimer's.

Speaker 1:          00:11:03       Um, there's some murkiness there because that's just on average, you know, we don't know if that, that risk applies to people who are eating, you know, paleo type of diet, doing crossfit at taking care of themselves in every other way. We just know that, that the general population in the general population, a higher ldl p leads to a higher risk of these conditions. Now, I know pete, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I know people, um, some people know this, but some people don't. What is the difference between ldl and hdl and wise one good and one bad? Well, he asked, here's, yeah, here's an example of how things are changing again. Um, so historically the idea has been that ldl, which stands for low density lipoprotein and hdl stands for high density lipoprotein the ldl. The idea was it was bad, um, has a number of effects that contribute to the risk of heart disease.

Speaker 1:          00:11:58       Whereas hdl does a kind of like clean up and repair process and actually reduces the risk of heart disease, but just a couple of weeks ago there was some pretty influential research published suggesting that hdl may not be actually so protective and it may be more of like a like a bystander effect where people that have lower risks of heart disease just just also have higher hdl and it's not that the hdl is protecting them. It's whatever other underlying processes are protecting them happened to lead to higher hdl levels and the reason that they think this now is that they. They've done a whole bunch of trials on drugs that raise hdl and guess what? Nothing happens. They don't need the people who have an increase in their hdl because of the drugs don't have a lower risk of heart disease. And in some cases they've even had to stop the trials because it became clear that there was not only no benefit but maybe even some harm.

Speaker 1:          00:12:58       So what kind of harm would there be? Just more know more cardiovascular events or more deaths. So it's just another example of something that we just assume for so long it's true. And then we find out that it's not true. I had a conversation with a guy who's a brilliant guy and we were talking about eggs and uh, uh, I said, I, I like to eat about four to six eggs a day. It was like, wow, what about all the cholesterol? Yeah. And I'm like, wow, you don't know. And like you don't know that and you're a really smart guy. Like this is kind of stunning. Yeah. I mean it's. And it's gonna take. So, so what I just told you about hdl, think of everything that has to change to reflect that new understanding. You've got textbooks that need to be rewritten. You've got primary care guidelines you've got, it's just massive.

Speaker 1:          00:13:42       It's almost impossible to get our head around. And so the average primary care provider's not going to get this message for decades, I would say decades, not more than years. That's crazy. Yeah. So they're going to be giving out bad advice to people. So the average person who works all day and doesn't have the time to do the research that you do or you know, maybe isn't informed about all the various blogs and books and just doesn't have time, goes to his primary care doctor and ask him questions and he gets terrible information because then unfortunately the primary care doctor doesn't have the time either. You know, they're, they're, they're in a bad spot. You know, I know a lot of primary care physicians, they're all, everyone I know went into medicine for the right reason. They're trying to help people. They're doing their best, but they're seeing 2,500 patients.

Speaker 1:          00:14:29       That's how many they have on their roster. Their average visit is eight, is between eight and 12 minutes because they get reimbursed based on the number of visits. So they, in order to make a living, they have to see a certain number of patients a day. And the insurance companies often mandate that. Um, so in a 10 minute visit, patient shows up with multiple chronic conditions, taking multiple medications, uh, and then presenting with new symptoms that they're concerned about. There's barely enough time to say hello and you know, figure out what's going on with their meds and make an adjustment and make a new prescription much less to talk to them in any kind of meaningful way about their diet and their lifestyle and their behavior. Forget it. It's impossible. So the, the primary care doctors I think are as much victims of the, of, of our conventional system and the way it's set up as patients are and if they're busting their butts, seeing patients eight hours a day every day, and then they have all the paperwork to do on top of that last thing they're going to want to do is go home and fire up pub pub mat and start reading, you know, the latest studies that have come out for sure they're going to be exhausted.

Speaker 1:          00:15:35       Non-motivated. Yeah. And they got families, you know, they have other things to do. And, and, and, and there are studies that have shown that the majority of of primary care physicians, understandably given this situation, receive most of their education from pharmaceutical sales reps. You know, who bring in the brochures and to, you know, talk about a particular condition and of course those are, that's not going to be unbiased information. That's hilarious that they get their information from that. Wow. Yeah. Because the reps come to the office, you know, and so and they have the brochures to the drugs and the in the brochures. Talk about the condition and you know, they have cartoons and pictures in there and showing you the bad stuff that's happening to your arteries. It's crazy. It's a crazy system and it's really, it's, we're in big trouble. I mean that's the message in my book.

Speaker 1:          00:16:24       It's like, you know, this is not just about individual health, which is my first book was about taking back your own health. This book is about taking back healthcare because we're, we're screwed. if you look at the numbers and by the year 20, 40, it's estimated at 100 percent of the federal federal budget will go towards medicare and medicaid expenses leading nothing for anything else. Military and just want someone with 20, 40 watts talking about our lifetimes. That's real. That's real. That's if, if healthcare spending continues to increase at its current pace, that's insane. You're right. That does not. This is why the department of defense's has named healthcare as an existential threat to this country, just like, you know, nuclear war or any other military threat. They've named chronic disease as an existential threat that could actually, uh, you know, threaten our survival as a nation.

Speaker 1:          00:17:22       Wow. Whoever thought of it that way, who could have ever imagined that literally all of our budget would go to take care of people's health by 20, 40. That's not long. It's not long in. Let me, let me give you a few examples just to, you know, to make this more clear. So the cost of treating a patient with type two diabetes is estimated to be $14,000 a year. Okay. So we know now that a hundred million americans, that's like a third of the population have either prediabetes or type two diabetes. Yeah. Wait a minute. cdc just published these numbers. 100 million americans have prediabetes or type two diabetes, one third, one third. And that is the. I'm having a hard time. If you had just asked me like what percentage of americans have diabetes? I probably said like four percent percent who actually have type two diabetes is lower it, but I said prediabetes or type two diabetes.

Speaker 1:          00:18:28       Yeah, so, so here are a couple other sets. A 88 percent of people who have prediabetes don't know that they have it at 87 percent and the average amount of time it takes for someone to progress from prediabetes to full fledged type two diabetes is just five years. Wow. So let's go back to that number. $14,000 a year to treat a single patient with type two diabetes. Imagine someone gets diagnosed at age 40, which is totally possible. I mean now even eight year old kids, they're being diagnosed with type two diabetes and imagine that person lives at an another 45 years, which is also feasible because we have these. One of the amazing things about conventional medicine into the technologies that keep us alive probably a lot longer than we should be. So let's say that person lives 45 years. We spent $13,000 a year, a $14,000 a year treating that person, that's $630,000 to treat one patient with one disease over that patient, you know, remaining lifetime.

Speaker 1:          00:19:35       Now if you start doing some math and you assume how, you know, even 50 million people with diabetes times $630,000, you get a number with so many zeroes after it. I don't even know what it is. It's like a google or a google plex or something. So this is why we're, we're facing this threat and this is why I wrote the book. It's like people aren't aware that we're at this point where, you know, like one in two americans now as a chronic disease, one in four have multiple, one in two americans has a chronic disease, one into one in four have multiple chronic diseases. And I know you're a parent so, and I am 2:30 percent almost of kids now have a chronic disease and that's up from just 13 percent in 1994. So there's been more than a doubling of kids with chronic disease and less than 25 years.

Speaker 1:          00:20:27       How has that, what has changed in the american diet? YoU attributing it to the american american and affects all of the above. So I wouldn't say it's the diet, It's an increase in sedentary activity, you know, lIke a sitting for very long periods, not moving around, not enough exposure to artificial or non exposure to bright, to, to natural light. Too much exposure to artificial light, not enough sleep, you know? So all of these things come together and now we've got a nation of people with chronic disease and chronic disease is bankrupting our country and it's extremely difficult to treat. It lasts for a lifetime and our only hope actually of dealing with this problem and surviving as a, as a country, as a nation, is to figure out a way to prevent and reverse disease instead of just suppressing symptoms and putting bandaids on it, which is what our current conventional medical system does.

Speaker 1:          00:21:28       Do you really scared me with that diabetes number, that debts really freaking out. I can't believe that. Well, what do you pull them up, jane? More than 100 million americans have diabetes or its precursor. Staggering. Cdc report reveals, and this is just from july. Yeah. Wow. In 2015, least one point 5 million new cases were diagnosed and people over 18. Now a third of the us population is diabetes. Diabetes. Let me throw a couple others that you, uh, the cdc just updated it to obesity statistics. Now, 40 percent of us adults are obese. Oh my god. Forty percent for intent, not just overweight, obese and 30 percent, 40 percent and almost 20 percent of adolescents are now obese. Now, how are they based in this? By those body standards, body mass index, obesity, that it's not. That doesn't work. It's not perfect, but it's not so, so imperfect that it's, you know, we're talking about a 20 percent difference.

Speaker 1:          00:22:29       Look at body mass Index, five foot eight, 200 pounds. I think I'm like dying. I think like, yeah, like if you look at the body mass index, I think I'm like, have to have terrible health, but all you have to do is go to an airport. You know, I just flew down here, you know, you sit in an airport and you look around yo the sticks or crowds, but there's also a lot of people that lift weights, like there's a lot of people that are bigger. I would like to know what the, you know, what am I obese. Yeah, I'm obese. Come on. Damn that. Come on site. I mean look, but you don't have diabetes and you're not 10 percent body fat or. Yeah, so that's just not real. That's not real. It's not that. Well, I don't know. I think that statistic. I mean, what do you think out of 10 people that you see on the street are for obese?

Speaker 1:          00:23:18       Well, if I'm obese now I know that I'm obese, right? According to that will give you gotta throw that thing out the window. That's not a good metric. It's not a perfect metric, but they have done studies where they have accounted for that and they do. You do see some variation, but you're. You're not the norm. You're not, you're not, you're an outlier. I'm aware of that, but I think there's probably got to be quite a few outliers out there. There are quite a few but not enough on ever, but not enough to change that statistic in a really meaningful way. It's not going to, you know, there aren't 20 percent of you, you know, it's not going to drop that from 40 percent to 20 percent. So maybe 40 to 35. Is that reasonable? Still a lot back. Yeah, that's, I would say maybe 40 to 39 or 38.

Speaker 1:          00:24:03       Jesus. Yeah. So, so, so here's the deal, you know, uh, we can't, it doesn't matter who. So that the whole recent healthcare debate with the affordable care act and, and then the current administration suggesting something different. That whole discussion revolved around how we're going to pay for health care, you know, insurance, health insurance. But we have to understand that health insurance is not the same thing as healthcare, right? It's a method, it's a method of paying for healthcare. And my key point in the book is it doesn't matter what method of health that we use to pay for healthcare, whether it's the government, whether it's corporations or whether it's individuals, there is no method that sustainable in the face of the rising rates of chronic disease that we're seeing, that there's. There's nothing that would be fascinating as I am pretty aware of this stuff and I didn't know what you're telling me and I'm stunned.

Speaker 1:          00:24:57       I'm stunned at the number of people with chronic disease and I'm stunned at the number of people that are either prediabetic or diabetic. I really don't know how to digest that. That's, that's horrific. And that could be attributed almost entirely to diet in a lack of extra sets of preventable disease. That's the crazy thing. Type two diabetes is a fully preventable condition in type one diabetes varies in what way? That's an autoimmune condition and it's strongly genetically mediated. So it's. Which means that it doesn't necessarily mean that if you have the genes you're going to get the disease, but there's, you know, 50 percent of the risk I think is the statistic that I've seen a of type one diabetes is genetic. Whereas we know now that 85 percent of the risk of of disease in generaL comes down to environmental and behavioral factors. Behavioral meaning you die, yeah, or or your sleep or your, you know, your physical activity, stress management, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          00:25:56       So that means only 15 percent of the risk of disease is genetic, you know, purely genetically a driven. Whereas the other 85 percent, which is the vast majority is actually under our control. I was looking at a statistic that made a correlation between sleep and weight loss and saying that people who slept an average of eight to 10 hours a day had a significant, a significant, significantly less body fat and weighed less and lost more weight than people who did the exact same activity but slept four to six hours. Yeah. I would say that among a people who research a weight regulation, sleep is now recognized as being the second most influential lifestyle factor that determines our weight aside from diet low. I had I ahead of physical activity, so I got a couple of good ones for you. A single night of sleep deprivation has been shown to cause mild insulin resistance, even in healthy people with no preexisting blood sugar disorders.

Speaker 1:          00:27:05       So just one night of not sleeping well can cause a little bit of insulin resistance the next day. I mean, it's transient, it goes, goes away, but that's significant. There was a study where they, they deprive people of sleep for eight nights in a row pretty severely. It wasn't obviously not total sleep deprivation because they'd be dead, but you really be dead for eight nights in a row. I think so, yeah. I mean a partial partial but significant sleep deprivation for eight nights in a row. these people ate an additional 566 calories a day, um, during that period with no changes in resting energy expenditure. So that's equivalent to gaining a pound a week of bodyweight or 52 pounds in a year. So most people won't have that severe of sleep deprivation, but if you just even have mild sleep deprivation, you know, over a significant period, what if that could account for 10 pounds of weight gain a year and over, you know, 10 years, you're, you're, you're talking about a lot of weekends.

Speaker 1:          00:28:04       Yeah. So is it because you're sleepy, so you just force yourself to eat food? Like what? no, it just, it totally screwed. It totally screws with hormone production and all the hormones that regulate appetite and satiety and, and things like that. So his laptop and his tire and appetites higher. It's hard to get satiated and it also decreases your willpower and judgment around food. So people are likely to make worse choices when it comes to food. I know I do. yeah. Do. If I'm really, really tired, I immediately go to like bullshit cheeseburgers or something. Absolutely. It's, it's, uh, it's part of what has been documented that happens. yeah. You like reward yourself with something that's terrible for you. Yeah. Know probably in, there's, that's also related to the changes in brain chemistry that happened. So. Wow. Yeah. Wow. And, and now we know that a third of americans get fewer than six hours of sleep and outside of maybe three percent of the population that has a gene that allows them to, you know, be okay with that, that few hours of sleep, the vast majority of people need seven to eight and a half hours of sleep to function properly.

Speaker 1:          00:29:20       And that's been clearly documented. Yeah. I had read something about outliers in terms of performance outliers. There are a lot of people, um, that uh, like entrepreneurs guys were killing it out there. They're, they're getting like four to five hours sleep at night. And I was stunned by that and I was like, how's that possible account? How are these people that are, you know, they're doing all these physical activities working out, running their business. And then I found out about adderall. Right. So there's that. Yeah. I mean, as I said, there are some genetic polymorphisms that we at least some research suggests that allow people to, you know, deal with less sleep than others. But yeah, I think in that community there's a lot of stimulant use. It's driving that and at some point they're going to pay the price. Yeah. They need to come clean about that.

Speaker 1:          00:30:09       Like that's the dirty little secret. I have friends that are entrepreneurs in silicon valley people and did the way they describe it, it's like, like people chewing gum. It's just everywhere. Everyone is doing new vigil provigil which are apparently less problematic and then adderall across the board. Yeah, it's crazy. I mean we're, we're, we're making choices now, both individually and collectively that are taking us in the wrong direction. And you know, the, this, this week I've shared a few stats that kind of blew you away and they've blown me away to, you know, when I was researching the book, this is how it all came together. For me it was, it was like a wake up call, you know, so I have a six year old daughter and now you have kids. Today's kids are the first generation that are expected to live shorter lifespans than us, their parents.

Speaker 1:          00:31:03       That's just crazy. You know, as long as we, based on this statistic about diabetes, the dramatic increase in chronic disease. So as long as we've been measuring it in the modern world, lifespans just been going like this, you know, there's been a few blips due to pandemics, like the spanish flu, but for as long as we've been measuring, it's just going up, up, up, up, and now this is the first generation of kids. It's actually expected start going back in the other direction. I showed my kids that, that sugar documentary, my wife showed it to them. It lasted about four months and then they will like, who gives a shit? Let's get back to the ice cream.

Speaker 1:          00:31:39       The kids, it's not like it's hard because we're hard that this is where the evolutionary perspective is so important for people to understand where we're hardwired, to seek out foods that are calorie dense and highly rewarding and by rewarding, I'm talking about that term in the scientific context context, which means eating something makes you want to eat more of it, right, so a potato, chips, ice cream, highly rewarding because you'll keep eating them even beyond the point where your hunger has been satisfied. A baked potato with no salt or butter, not very rewarding. You know you'll eat if you're hungry, you'll eat it, but you won't eat more than your hungry for and even a steak which is most people like and it's tastes good. When's the last time you heard about somebody bingeing on a steak? It doesn't really happen because it's not highly rewarding in that way, but human beings evolved in an environment of food scarcity, so we have these wired genetic

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       biological mechanisms that caused us to seek out foods that have a lot of calories and that are very palatable and rewarding because that would signal to us that they have different, different nutrients, macro nutrients, flavors, et cetera. And we're in an environment of food scarcity that works really well because, you know, stocking up on calories would allow us to survive a period of, of, you know, famine or, or food shortage or you know, unable to locate food, etc. So we have all these mechanisms that were originally designed to help us survive starvation in a natural environment. That's all well and good when we're living in that kind of environment. But what happens when we live in an environment where there is a seven slash 11 on every corner and amazon delivering food your door and a costco around the, around the block. Food is everywhere.

Speaker 3:          00:33:34       And so all of these mechanisms that actually helped us to survive in our ancestral environment cause set us up for failure in this modern food environment. And we capitalize on that with things like the banana split. Yeah. Well the thing is that big big food, they hire scientists who understand these mechanisms and specifically designed foods to hit all of those circuits. You know, what do you think is like probably is there a statistically most addictive food? Uh, I don't know actually the answer to that question. I mean there's, there's a lot of controversy about whether sugar is addictive in the sense, in the true sense of the way that scientists use the term addictive like meth. Yeah, exactly. But, And they're both sides of that debate. Um, but I think most of us can have, you know, just on our, in our own personal experience can kind of assess the effect that sugar has on us or our kids or whatever it.

Speaker 3:          00:34:35       It's highly rewarding in the sense that it makes us want more and more of it. It's not addicted to me in the sense of like I get a detox if I'm not having it, but if it's around me and I wanted, the craving is very creepy. Right. You know, like what is this jamie? Most addictive foods? Pizza is number one. Yeah. Wow. It's based on a health line.com study. I'll tell you what, man, this, there might be something of that was when we were in New York and uh, you brought over those slices of pizza. Goddamn, those are good. they couldn't figure out a way to make that pizza here we have real problems. Well, it's interesting that you showed that because I'm the top six foods in the american diet, according to cow, the amount of calories that they comprise in our diet or a pizza bread, grain based desserts, alcohol, sugar sweetened beverages and chicken dishes, primarily fried chicken dishes, like chicken nuggets from mcdonald's.

Speaker 3:          00:35:35       Those six foods comprise the majority of the calories that the average american eats. And then you look at our ancestral diet. It was mostly, you know, meat and fish, wild fruits and vegetables, not even the domesticated varieties that we eat today, nuts and seeds and a lot of starchy fibrous plants, um, many of which aren't even available to us at this point, but, you know, sweet potatoes would be our kind of modern analog of that. And so you have a situation where we evolved in the context of eating those foods, which are, they're nutrient dense, they're anti inflammatory and they're naturally low in calories and they're all foods that are very hard for us to overeat. Again, like it's when you don't hear about people bingeing on broccoli, you don't hear about them. Bingeing on steak, you your money macadamia nuts, man. I yesterday, last night I got home and I just had 14 sweet potatoes.

Speaker 3:          00:36:28       I hear about that. And even if they have sweet potatoes, a lot of times people put brown sugar on them, right? Like maple syrup or something like that, which then you might be, you might overeat them, but if in those foods in their natural state, we're not going to overeat them. We're going to eat til we're satiated. um, but all the other foods that I just mentioned, those top six foods, pizza, grain based desserts like cake bread, et cetera, they're all foods that trigger all those reward circuits in a big way. And we've all had the experience, I'm sure of overeating pretty or overconsuming everything on that list.

Speaker 2:          00:37:02       I used to always, uh, coming home from jujitsu, I would order an extra large pizza and eat it myself. It was this big, it was huge and I would get, I would get either pineapple and double pineapple on double anchovies, which I know some people think it's disgusting, but it's very delicious. Or I would get a pepperoni and mushrooms and I would kill that thing. And then afterwards I would literally feel like somebody opened up my mouth, like they were trying to force feed of goose to make fog fagua and they just poured cement into my stomach and then I just lay there and just feel terrible and feel thAt insulin spike and your whole body just reacts this sludge that you're forcing it to process. Just doe,

Speaker 3:          00:37:44       you know? And she's. And the cheese is great though.

Speaker 2:          00:37:47       Yeah, I mean it's a step, but it's that, that it seems to. The doe is what gives you that ball. That's the heavy got bomb. Yeah, the gut bomb. Yeah. Why is it so good though? Because I'll tell you what, those alternatives, they suck and that they're not that good. They're good food, but they did. Still, there's not the same. There's no free ride right there. No decadent alternative. Although I did find a very good cookie. There's a company called no. Do you know no foods and seeing that go grab one of those things. Yeah, they have. Oh, we got one right there. Yeah, it's not bad, man. They're fucking. No can dabble, yada. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I'm sugars like a s for the entire cookie. Twenty eight grams, 28 grams of sugar. It's a big ass cook. Yeah. I see that. And, but

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       it's all like, um, and, and I actually enjoy eating it, but if you look at the ingredients, it's all okay. Here we go with almonds. Coconuts, egg whites, flaxseed, chia seed, zero trans fat, and a 16 grams. Eighteen grams of protein, four grams net carbs, 10 grams of fiber. Yeah, for a coupon and it tastes pretty good, but it's not as good as not a large pizza with anchovies and pineapple on it. Not as good as like a Mrs. Fields chocolate chip cookie. YoU know when you pull it apart in that string of chocolate, you know that absolutely. I mean the nice glass of milk and those are all good because they, they, they, like I said, the trigger, all of those hardwired reward circuits. They push all the right buttons. Yeah, they get you. It is amazing how many foods there are that are like that.

Speaker 1:          00:39:29       If you stop and think about like just going down the street, walk in a normal street where there's a bunch of stores and restaurants, like how much of that stuff is bad for you? It's primarily bad for you. It's primarily bad and you think the whole modern food environment is that way and that's what I mean. We're set up to fail. Anyone who said who sets out to be lean and fit and healthy is swimming upstream. You have to be put in some serious extra. You have to constantly be putting in effort because there's a barrage of advertisements you walk into a grocery store, all of those foods are triggering all of those circuits that make us seek and crave those foods because those are evolutionary mechanisms that cannot be consciously overridden very easily, and this is why weight loss continues to be a billion dollar multibillion dollar industry because information is not enough for most people.

Speaker 1:          00:40:21       It's not enough just to know what foods are healthy, which foods are unhealthy because we're. We're operating from a much deeper system. The olympics, the limbic system are kind of lizard brain that is driving our preferences for food and what foods we seek in which foods we don't see and that's below the level of conscious thought that no where we say, okay, I know that food's not good and I know this food is good, but then that lizard brain is like, eh, you know you had a delicious you. It's almost like if you're walking by, like if you have some potato chips or something on the shelf and you walk by it, it's almost like there's an invisible hand on your shoulder pushing you towards you can. You can kind of go hand. I stop pushing, stop pushing me, or you can go, all right. Yeah. You just kind of give and here's the key thing to understand too, that it's not because you're weak person or you don't have willpower. It's because you're a human being and that's how your brain is programmed. Yeah. That is a very important thing to realize that there's a reason why it's difficult for you and and even for people that think it's, well, it's not difficult for me, man. Well maybe if you've conditioned yourself and if you've conditioned your body and condition, especially your diet, there's something

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       that does happen when your gut biome changes where your cravings change. Absolutely, but if you're eating a lot of sugar, it is incredibly difficult to get off that because that is what that gut biome wants and there's some sort of a very strange difficult to pin down feeling that would. That craving is. It's very difficult to sort of intellectualize, right? Like if you have to go to the bathroom, it's very clear. Oh my god, I got to pee. It's like there, you feel it, you know what it is, but the weird hunger craving for sugar is almost like you can't grab it. You can't like hold on to and go, this is what I'm talking about. This is that thing.

Speaker 3:          00:42:10       Well, there's the example I like to use. there's a parasite that the whole life cycle is really interesting. You probably aware of it. It, it ends up in mice and it changes the behavior. Yeah. Toxoplasma gondii changes the behavior of mice so that they are dumber in terms of their ability to evade getting eaten by a cat. Yeah, and then so then they get eaten by the cat and then the toxoplasma transfers to the cat where and goes to the cat's brain where it normally lives, so that's an example of how a tiny, tiny little micro, but you can't even see with your eye can powerfully control behavior and as you just said, we've got trillions of microbes in our gut that control our behavior and things like our food preferences and cravings.

Speaker 2:          00:42:55       We had robert sapolsky on the podcast talking about that and he said that some of the mice, it actually rewires their sexual reward system, makes them attracted to the smell of cat urine. Right? So their, their testes swell and they're, they're, they're literally like horny little zombies running straight towards the cats. It completely rewires their fear of cats that goes out the window. And the reason being is that the only way that toxo plasma can reproduce is inside the cat's gut. Yup. Which is just insane. Like what kind of a twisted system and how did this evolve over all these years, like the gut biome and gut bacteria. It is so fascinating to me.

Speaker 3:          00:43:38       Here's a, here's an interesting way of looking at it. Do you know justin sonnenburg? He's a microbiologist at stanford. Really fast. Interesting guy. Brilliant. He, I'm going to Paraphrase this because I won't get the quote exactly right, but he wrote a book about the gut microbiome and he said something to the effect of humans or are just the elaborate elaborate vessels for the propagation of microorganisms probably right. He's basically saying that we're kind of the evolutionary vehicle or tool for, for the microbes that live in our gut. They've been around a lot longer than us. Um, a lot longer. They outnumber us, you know, the, the, the number of microbial cells in the body are more than the number of human cells. So there's lots of different ways to interpret, but I think

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       at the very minimum you, you start to see how important that microbial community is to our overall health and also our behavior. Yeah. And if you really want to get creepy, think about how like categorically they don't vary individually, like they're, they're essentially the exact same thing in mass numbers, acting in the interest of the mass numbers. And then influencing us, which vary widely and our different actions propagate them in different ways. I'm freaking out. It's especially weird too, when you think that all of that stuff, all of those microorganisms that are in our gut, they're not actually in our body. So they're not really part of us. They're just hanging out there. Well, think about a tunnel. So you go through a tunnel under a river, you're not in the river, woo. You're just in a tunnel under the river. And our gut is a hollow tube that goes from our mouth to our anus, intersects our body. But everything inside the tube is technically outside of the body.

Speaker 1:          00:45:39       So their influence, they're influencing us from inside the tunnel, from inside of the tunnel. They're not really inside of our bodies, so they're kind of running the show, but they're not really in us. So it's like a car inside the tunnel that's controlling the river. Yet jesus christ more freaking out, freaking out. When I thought about that. And the crazy thing is that they can affect. mood, can affect, depression, can affect, uh, your ambition, the way you behave. In a study on the way down here, and I did a feed of all the new research and it showed that overgrowth of bacteria in our small intestine, which is part of our got, is associated with heart problems, so it's, you know, and they don't actually know why yet, but so, so, um, you know, something going on and with the cars in the tunnel is really tweaking the river and just about every way you can imagine.

Speaker 1:          00:46:36       It's not just about gut as you know, it affects every system in the body. So paul was saying that one of the people that he worked with found during his residency that there's a disproportionate number of motorcycle accidents that were attributed to people were infected by toxoplasma because it made them more impulsive. Right. I can change human behavior as Well. Yeah. Well, I think we talked about this last time, but the prevalent theory now I'm. What causes depression is that it's a disrupted gut microbiome that causes inflammation. It, it leads to the production of what are called cytokines. They're chemical messengers, inflammatory cytokines. They traveled across the gut barrier. They go into the blood, travel up into the brain and cross the blood brain barrier, and then they suppress the activity in the frontal cortex, which causes all the telltale signs and symptoms of depression. So what if depression, which we have thought about either

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       as a, you know, disruption of brain chemistry or something that's purely situational, is actually, uh, you know, has a physiological causes as a driver. Now that's not to say that those situational factors don't matter. I don't want to be reductionist here and say depression is only caused by gut inflammation. I think that's ridiculous. But, uh, the problem is the average person goes into the doctor with depression. They're going to come out of that office with a prescription for an antidepressant. There's not going to be any investigation into their got and whether they have inflammation in the gut and intestinal permeability, there's not gonna be a referral to a gastroenterologist to, to check that out. And this is, of course, one of the problems with the conventional system. The way it's set up is we had a doctor for every different part of the body and there's no quarterback.

Speaker 3:          00:48:19       It's really overseeing that whole thing that ideally that would be the primary care provider, but because their appointments are 10 minutes, they've got 2,500 patients on their roster. There's no time for that. Yeah. You'd have to find a doctor that's very meticulous. It's willing to go over your blood work for you and check out what your diet is. Yeah. We'll take ours and wnl as they say, we're not looking. So imagine a patient that goes into the doctor and they've got depression. Let's say they've got a eczema or psoriasis. They've got a digestive issues and they've got a brain fog, cognitive problems like a whole big roster of symptoms and the and the primary care provider might give them an antidepressant for the depression. They give them a steroid skin cream for the skin problem. They, you know, they, they, they leave with a handful of medications.

Speaker 3:          00:49:10       But what if there was one thing that was causing all these problems are one underlying cause. It was leading to all that. So just, you know, in this example, what if that patient had gluten intolerance and they hadn't been properly diagnosed? We know now from the research that gluten intolerance doesn't just cause the gi distress, a lot of people get, it also can cause, you know, it's associated with dermatitis, which is eczema. It's associated with all kinds of cognitive and neurological problems. So a single food protein could be leading to all of these different symptoms. But in the conventional system, they might go to the primary care doctor, then they get a referral to the dermatologist, they get a referral to the gastroenterologist, they maybe get a referral to a neurologist or a psychiatrist. They're seeing all these separate people to deal with all these separate symptoms like, you know, playing whack a mole with the symptoms.

Speaker 3:          00:50:01       They take one drug, uh, the antidepressant, but then maybe the antidepressant causes constipation. So then you go to the gastroenterologist and they get a drug for the, you know, a laxative for the constipation. And then before, you know, it's just this incredibly complex web of all these drug interactions and, and all the focus is on suppressing these symptoms with different doctors for different body parts. When in this example, at least it was something as simple as a food protein. It could be easily removed from the diet, maybe not easily, but you know, gluten's in a lot of things. But I'm taken out and then all of those problems which seemed like they were separate and disconnected go away. And that's really the promise of functional medicine because instead of looking at things, starting with the symptoms and then working backwards, we're starting from the, the, the, the inside and, and working out.

Speaker 3:          00:50:56       So, you know, an analogy I like to use is if you have a rock in your shoe and it's making your foot hurt and you go to, into the conventional system, you'll end up with a diagnosis of foot pain. Or actually we'll be fancier, you know, there'll be like the latin name for foot and pain or something. It sounds more official and you know, and then you'll get a painkiller and the painkiller will help, you know, it'll reduce the pain a little bit, but obviously it makes a lot more sense to just take your shoe off and dump out the rock. ANd that's really what functional medicine is about now when it comes to gluten intolerance, that's one that gets dIsmissed as it sounds. It sounds frivolous, like, oh, all of a sudden everyone's gluten intolerant, like this is crazy. But my belief is that there's varying levels of this and that it's something that people have just dismissed, is a weird feeling that you get after you eat gluten and that they're not really in tune with the effect of inflammation and that there's a real difference between the we'd have today and the we'd have say the early 19 hundreds.

Speaker 3:          00:51:58       It's been maniPulated. I think there are a few reasons. There's misunderstanding about this. Number one is that, uh, there up untIl recently has not been a, uh, an understanding of the difference between celiac disease and non celiac gluten sensitivity. So for a long time the idea was either have celiac or you're not sensitive to gluten. That's it. I've heard that recently. Yeah. There's no gray area that's preposterous. Anyone who still believes that has not even done the most cursory search of the scientific literature. you can go in and anyone who's watching who's listening or watching can go to pub med.gov, pub, med.gov in the search field type, non celiac, gluten sensitivity or non-celiac wheat sensitivity and tell me how many results come up, do it. It's going to be a lot. Okay, and it's going to be linking and this goes to the second point.

Speaker 3:          00:52:50       It's going to be linking not just to gut problems and diarrhea. It's going to link to all kinds of different conditions from depression to anxiety to heart issues, to hormone imbalance, to a cognitive problems, etc. So that's the second problem is historically how many? Six hundred and 50. Jesus and I and and there's lots of others. If you use some different terminology, you can find more. So with celiac disease, the initial idea was it, it just causes diarrhea and severe diarrhea and cramping and so the assumption was that if you don't have severe diarrhea and cramping when you eat gluten, you don't have celiac and you don't have any other kinds of gluten intolerance, but we now know that I'm there with celiac. There is, if there are forums called atypical or silent celiac, these are forms that do not present with the typical got presentation and the number of atypical celiac cases out.

Speaker 3:          00:53:53       Not, it's much higher than the number of typical ones. So a patient goes to the doctor, they're having, you know, uh, headaches, they're having motor problems, they're having a, you know, all kinds of other issues. The doctor, if they think that celiac is only about gut issues and not even think about testing that patient for gluten intolerance, what kind of motor issues would you get? Well, there was a, there was something called a attacks sia, which is a form of paralysis that can be caused by gluten sensitivity. Yeah, you can get paralyzed from the kids. It's called gluten associated attacks, ia, jesus christ. And this is for people who are non celiac. Yeah. So, so that's the second problem is, is again w and l we're not looking. So the patients go to the doctor, they have all these weird kind of complaints, the doctor, but they don't have gut issues.

Speaker 3:          00:54:43       So the doctor then rules out celiac or non celiac, gluten sensitivity because they don't yet know that it can manifest in all these different ways. So how is this happening? Is that the tolerance that you have for gluten, when you consume that gluten, the gluten goes into the gut and interacts with your gut biome. And then what's the. What's the mechanism? There's two different mechanisms and celiac. There's an autoimmune mechanism where the proteins in gluten, the body creates antibodies towards those proteins, and also there's like a bystander effect where certain tissues in the body that have similar protein structures to gluten get attacked as well. Certain enzymes, trans glutamates to transglutaminase is three in trans contaminates, six. And here's the thing you knoW, related to what we were just talking about, transglutaminase two is is is typically found in the gut. So that's why a lot of people who have celiac have these gut issues is because their body is actually attacking the gut tissue and breaking it down.

Speaker 3:          00:55:43       It's an autoimmune reaction, but now we know that trend there. That same autoimmune reaction can be directed at transcript tammany's three, which is primarily in the skin, which is why something like 30 percent of people with celiac also have eczema and other skin problems and trans contaminated six is in the brain. So this, if you, if a person who has antibody production against trans contaminated sixth eats gluten, their body attacks their brain. Whoa. And that's why it breaks down the enzyme, which has played a number of important roLes in the brain. And so this is why celiac and also non celiac, gluten sensitivity is associated with a whole bunch of different cognitive issues like, and also actual motor problems. I a taxi because it's attacking the brain. The immune system's attacking the brain and that leads to some potentially very serious problems. when did they start to alter wheat?

Speaker 3:          00:56:40       Like w what, what year do you know? I don't know and I do think that is an issue because I've, there's so many people that have gone to europe, you know, they eat, we eat here and they go to europe and they can eat. We. Yeah. Um, but I think there are some other things that are actually more meaningful and significant and this leads me to the third reason why I think we've underestimated, you know, gluten sensitivity and why people don't understand how significant it can be. Um, we're not living in a, in a vacuum, you know. So let's say you've got a person who is like a hunter gatherer. They've been living in a pristine environment, you know, they eat all nutrient dense, you know, good food. Their gut microbiome is thriving because they'd been eating plenty of fermentable fiber and you know, probiotic type of foods and they're just super healthy.

Speaker 3:          00:57:32       If that person gets exposed to gluten, they might not have any problem. But then you take a person who is living in the modern industrialized world, they're sleeping five hours a night there. They've taken antibiotics, you know, 30 but 30 courses of antibiotics by the time they're an adult, which is not an exaggeration that, you know, I can't remember the exact number, but it's extremely high that the average number of courses of antibiotics, they were born by c section. They eat a crappy diet with a lot of processed and refined foods and they're sedentary, they're not exercising, so this person is in really bad shape and their immune system seriously dysregulated, and then when they get exposed to gluten, which might otherwise be a harmless protein, it causes problems. So I think the reason that more people are intolerant of gluten and intolerant of other foods now is it's not just because the foods have changed just because we've changed is because we have become compromised.

Speaker 3:          00:58:31       You know, we should. Human beings should be resilient and able to tolerate these kinds of, uh, food proteins. But when our immune system breaks down, we talked about the gut as a barrier system where everything that's inside the guide is outside the body. It's important to understand like in that the purpose of the gut is to serve as a selective barrier that determines what gets in and what stays out. Because everything we eat is either absorbed or eliminated as waste. And if that barrier becomes permeable in a nonselective way, meaning it loses the ability to make appropriate decisions about what gets in and out. Then food proteins, they would otherwise be benign and, and, you know, be broken down into

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       smaller particles and those small particles get absorbed and don't cause any problems. The larger food proteins get absorbed before they're broken down. And then that initiates an immune reaction. That wreaks havoc. Wow. So if someone has a healthy gut than the insult of some sort of a gluten protein being introduced into their, god's not going to be as big of a deal as if someone is just drinking gatorade all day and eat and cook zygosity. Uh, that makes sense is, it's like any other ecosystem. So if you think of like an ecosystem that's really healthy and you introduce a predator like a predator or you know, another, something else that could, could potentially throw it out of balance, it won't go out of balance because the whole ecosystem is working together to keep that in check. But then, you know, you hear about like the small islands where they introduced a particular, you know, a predator or prey species that then just because the ecosystem of that island is fragile, you get a huge proliferation, you know, where it's just all of a sudden there's nothing but deer on the island and until they start dying because of that imbalance, you know, and then it starts all over again.

Speaker 1:          01:00:31       So I've seen that before. I've seen that in Hawaii, on lanai, right? They're overrun With a, an animal called the axis deer. They're all over the place and for that same reason, and we have the same phenomenon, like if we have, if, if someone's got microbiome is severely disrupted especially. And that started as a kid, then they start, they developed gluten intolerance, they develop and tolerance to corn and soy and dairy and allergy. This is why allergies are on the rise in kids is my belief. It's not because there's some weird, you know, all of a sudden someone introduced some kind of poison that is causing kids to be more allergic. It's because of immune dysregulation. And that's happening because of the sleep issue, the food and all of the other aspects of the modern lifestyle. So what's the best approach for someone who wants to be healthier if they want to take control of their gut biome, is it just consuming a lot of very strong probiotic foods?

Speaker 1:          01:01:27       So the first thing is to just eat real food. I mean, I, I really liked boil it down to that three words, you know, eat real food and by real I mean not stuff that comes in a bag or a box, you know, the less processed and refined the better and that either came out of the ground or lives on the ground. Right, exactly. And you know, there are a lot of. We tend to get really, you know, I'm worked up about all the differences between, you know, there's [inaudible] you could say eat real food and do vegan. You could say real food and do paleo and you know that that's all great. But I really actually believe that if people just ate real food of any kind, we'd be in a totally different place than we are now. individual health issues would be worked out in the variations of those dials.

Speaker 1:          01:02:10       Exactly. That's where the fine tweaking comes. But we didn't get to this point because, um, you know, everyone's eating real food and everyone's doing or everyone's doing paleo. We got to this point because people are eating trash essentially. So one of the most key things with the gut microbiome to understand is that our healthy gut bacteria thrive on what are called fermentable carbohydrates or justin sonnenburg, who we talked about before, he calls them microbiotic accessible carbohydrates. These are fancy terms that just mean fiber. So what, what, what distingUished is fiber is that we don't break it down and turn it into glucose or you know, other molecules that we can absorb and use for our own energy. It stays in the gut to, you know, all the way to the colon and then the bacteria eat that fiber. so fiber is food for our beneficial gut bacteria and that's what makes them thrive.

Speaker 1:          01:03:05       so that's fascinating because most people think of fiber, they think of it almost as like a, like a laxative. Yeah. Yeah. I think it was something that's going to clean out their bowels. So not all fiber is fermentable by the gut bacteria. Some fiber just has that mechanical effect. It's more like, you know, pushing things through the bowels, whereas other fiber can actually be used as food by your gut bacteria. And that fiber's probably more bats. The more beneficial. So you're talking like sauerkraut, kimchi, those. Yeah, there's soLuble fiber that are present in a lot of fruits and vegetables. Um, you've got a non starch polysaccharides like inulin and fos and things like that that are in like onions and garlic, jerusalem, artichokes, leeks, umm. And then you've got resistant starch, which is actually not, that's in a lot of starchy plants that we used to eat, you know, way back in paleolithic era.

Speaker 1:          01:03:59       And some traditional hunter gatherers still do, but a resistant starch these days can be found in certain types of starches that have been cooked and cooled potatoes or lentils. Um, some people now are supplementing with resistance starch or they're eating a, like green unripe, bananas, unripe plantations, you know, what are those? Are those, do that because they're unripe it's the starches resistant. As they ripen the starch, it becomes just regular starch. Um, so cook those, like if you wanted to cook a green plantain use, you can slice them and then dehydrate them and you make them into chips. You can even buy plantain chips now at some health food stores by plantain chips. That's what you're getting. You're getting dehydrated, getting some resistant starch there, uh, or you can bake a white potato for example, and tHen let it cool. AnD that cooLing processes what forms of resistant starch. And this is what's really interesting. You know, most people think of potatoes is something that would spike their blood sugar because they have a lot of carbohydrate. But when you cook and cooled a potato, it won't have that effect because the resistance starts, you can't absorb and break that into glucose. Whoa. So, so when you cool a potato, it's better for you? Yeah. So there's

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       like a cold potato salad would actually not have the same effect on your blood sugar is eating a warm baked potato that you just cooked. In fact. Crazy. Have you heard of the potato? Heck no. This is probabLy the most effective diet that I've ever come across for weight loss and this is what I use in my practice with patients when nothing else has worked or if someone's super motivated and just wants to make progress quickly. A guy named tim steele introduced me to this and it was a. He has sent me some books that he found in the 1880 [inaudible] that referenced this diet. So this is oLD schooL and what you do is you basically eat nothing but potatoes and you, but you don't. They're plain potatoes so you can roast them or boil them, but you don't, you know, in the hardcore, the hardest core version.

Speaker 3:          01:06:12       You don't even add salt, you just plain baked potato or boiled potato. I'm certainly no butter chives, sour cream bacon, you know, because that increases the reward value as we were talking about earlier. The more variety there is, the more rewarding of food is okay. So, um, you just eat potatoes and there are different variations or different ways of doing it. You can do it for maybe just three days a week and then you can do your normal diet, you know, the other four days a week, uh, tim talks about a variation called potatoes by day, which means you just eat potatoes for breakfast and for lunch and then you eat a normal dinner. But I'm in my clinic and from tim's experience working with a lot of people, most people will lose an average of a half pound a day. And I think there are two there, there, there are a few things happening here and why it works.

Speaker 3:          01:07:05       Number one, uh, it's, it's totally playing towards these mechanisms that we talked about before. The, the, the reward, the reward value food, which is called the key donek system that drives our food craving and preferences. And just, let's do a thought experiment. If you have two plates of food and on one plate you have a steamed potato with no salt or butter or fat of any kind. And on this plate on the right you got a bag of potato chips or just a plate of potato chips. Which one are you going to eat less of? I mean it goes without saying, right? You're only going to eat the potato when you. When you're hungry and you're not going to eat probably a bite more than you're hungry for. Whereas the potato chips, all bets are off. Yeah, for most people. And so what happens is when you do the potato diet, you get a spontaneous calorie reduction and by spontaneous, I mean not voluntary, you're not setting out to say, okay, I'm only gonna. Eat a thousand calories today. You're saying I'm going to eat as many potatoes as I want to satiate my hunger, but just by definition, because of how our brain works, you're only going to eat. You're going to eat less than you would typically.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       so that's one thing. You get a reduction in calorie intake. The second thing is that when the. When you cook the potato, most people, the way they do this diet is they'll just cook like you know, all the potatoes that they need for the week on sunday to make it easy. So then I have to cook the potato every time they sit down to eat, so they cooked the potatoes and then they let them cool and so then each time you can still hit them back up, um, but, but they now have a lot of resistant starch. Even if you heat them back up, even if you hit them back up. And here's what's really cool about it. If you heat them up and cooled them again, each cooling cycle forms more resistant starch so that by the end of the week, if you've, if you're heating all the potatoes, backup and then cooling them again, each time you're going to have a potato that's mostly resistant starch, which means it will have zero impact on your blood sugar and it will be like a feast for your beneficial gut microbiome.

Speaker 1:          01:09:11       And that's another reason this diet probably works. We, you know, all about the studies correlating disrupted gut microbiome with obesity and diabetes. And so you're basically, the way I tell patients is you, you're basically going on an all fiber diet and you'll eat the skin too. You can eat the skin usually discussion, yeah. Yeah, yeah, skin has vitamins in it so people will lose up to a half a pound, you know, between a quarter and a half a pound a day that they're on the potato diet. It's amazing. So if you, let's say, you know, you decide I want to, I want to lose one and a half pounds a week. You do it for three days a week and you do that for six months. Then by the end of that six month period you've lost a pretty significant amount of weight. If you can keep that up, keep it up, the blend, the it. That's another fascinating aspect about diet is like how much of our life we were willing to forego health, happiness, all these different things just for some simple mouth pleasure for a few moments.

Speaker 1:          01:10:11       Yeah, I mean if you think about a pizza that you would eat that. I mean how long you need it for? Twenty minutes, 20 minutes out of a 24 hour day and you're going to feel like shit for at least an hour or two afterwards. You know, if you try to do anything like physical, it's going to be more than two hours before finally if you really want to go to the gym or you want to go for a run. Oh, and look, I'm not saying I think everyone should do this. I think food should be pleasurable and I think, you know, the way I eat, for example, I love the foods that I, you know, it's um, but, and this is why I say I don't suggest that anyone wants to start here, but I think it's interesting because it gets it. Some of what we've already been talking about how, why the modern food environment contributes to obesity and how using that knowledge and understanding of what triggers us to eat, we can turn that around and use it in our favor.

Speaker 1:          01:11:02       So another strategy that's similar is to just eat that but not quite as extreme as jesus eat the same thing for breakfast, lunch and dinner for like two or three days in a week. So you get bored with it that way. Exactly. That seems like all mental tricks, like someone would tell you, like someone like jocko say, just suck it up and being on there, it's using our understanding of our, our biology and our in our behavioral mechanisms to, to combat the way that the modern food environment is working against us. What do you think about like pre, pre planned meal programs? Like there's a lot of companies that sell a prepackaged meal delivery portioned. Yeah. That's not a bad way. I think those can play a role too because it's kind of a set and forget kind of thing. And you know what the portion size should be.

Speaker 1:          01:11:49       Um, there's, there's another strategy that's very simple that's been shown to contribute to weight loss and, and again, it, it plays to the same mechanisms which is to get smaller plates. So you know, a lot you go to target and you buy plates like this big, right? If it don't even fit in some of the dishwashers. Yeah. Um, and we don't even think it's just something you wouldn't even think about, but we have a tendency to fill that plate up. Yup. And just for shooting a smaller plate in any eating office, smaller plates has been shown to have a meaningful impact on weight loss. Yeah. Like you ever go to a buffet, like when buffet always take some obligation to, to get your money's worth, just gorge yourself bizarre combinations of food that you would never put together in any other context. but it's all there.

Speaker 1:          01:12:34       it's variety is a, it's a real problem. Some people say is like the antichrist for our, the way our brain works with food because it's variety. It's all like highly rewarding, you know, palatable foods. It's like the absolute worst possible thing. But if you think about it, our entire food environment is, it's like a buffet. You can go into any store at any time and get any kind of food to trigger any of those cravings. Yeah. Do you supplement with any sort of probiotics outside of regular food? Um, I will occasionally take probiotics. I mostly try to get it through fermented foods because I think that's probably. What do you choose? Sauerkraut is a great one. Kimchi, I do find with full fat fermented dairy like kefir or yogurt, sometimes we make our own yogurt for a minute longer so it has more microbes beat covas is a lesser known.

Speaker 1:          01:13:28       It's a beverage comes from Russia in that area. It's fermented beets and made into a juice gust. No, you, if you'd like some of these other ferments, I think you'd like it. No, I'm just joking around. I like kimchi and most people think it's file. yeah. Everyone in my house thinks it's vile. Now the beak of us is good and it's beats are super nutrient dense so. And the fermentation brings out even more nutrients. So it's like a super food beverage. Fermentation brings more nutrients. Interesting. Yeah. In what way? What did it makes them more bioavailable? Really? Yeah. What are, what, what nutrients does a fermenting? Well, uh, from, from fermenting creates a vitamin k for example. So fermented foods are wanting the best source of vitamin k two, and that's why a natto, which is fermented soybean product from Japan is the highest, you know, pound for pound, ounce for ounce is the highest source of vitamin k two.

Speaker 1:          01:14:18       There is that we know of, but cheese is another high source of k two and that's because it's fermented. Um, so most fermented foods have vitamin k sit in beer or wine or any of the other. I don't think so too bad. Yeah. Too bad. Um, so kimchi, sauerkraut, neto, this beat stuff eat yogurt, yogurt or a kefir, which is like a liquid form of yogurt. Um, there are a kids kiss a certain kinds of cheese. Cheese doesn't tend to be as beneficial in terms of the amount of microbes that are in. It will come up. Gucci, kombucha, I love that. And there's lots of different kinds of kombucha. There's also water kefir, which is like dairy kefir, but it's, it's, it's more like kombucha, but it's used, uh, they used the kefir cultures to make it a. Every traditional culture almost has a fermented food to it because our ancestors understood even without knowing the science that they were beneficial.

Speaker 1:          01:15:17       How bizarre. Well, yeah, they must've just trial and error right now outside of that, like what's a normal day in chris's life? Like as far as like your diet, like what do you, do you consume basically the same foods all the time or do you mix it up? Mix it up quite a bit. Um, lately I've been experimenting a lot with quito and ketogenetic diet fasting. I'm really interested in fasting right now. Um, so like I haven't eaten yet today. I just had coffee and some, some cream, which I do again, I do find with full fat dairy, I always do that lately. I'm not always, but I'm doing that a good solid four to five days a week where I'm doing intermittent fasting. About 14 hours. Yeah. I feel great when I do and I, I, I love it. I like the mental clarity and focus and to be honest, it's actually.

Speaker 1:          01:16:08       I mean I love food preparation. I like to cook, but it's nice to be able to have a break from that, you know, not to, not to worry about what I'm going to eat and cleaning up and all that stuff. And uh, so, you know, these days my average day is kind of like no breakfast fasting. Then I might have a wet mark, sisson calls a fat bomb salad for lunch if you know, if I have lunch, I might have a later lunch. Um, so that would be like a salad with a little bit of protein, chicken, fish, et cetera. And then like avocado and olives and you know, really good healthy fats. And then, um, if I'm not doing a key to genic phase, I'll have a normal dinner which would look like a portion of protein, lots of non starchy vegetable and like a sweet potato or a plantation or uh, uh, some taro root or one of these paleo friendly type of starches. And if you were going quito, how would you switch it up? Then? I would typically have the protein, the non starchy vegetables, and either like some zucchini noodles or turnip noodles. You can get like a spiralizer and make the noodles really easily and I would put some additional fat on those, those, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:17:20       vegetable noodles or I might just have another non starchy vegetable along with fat or a salad on top of. You're essentially just manipulating the fat levels. other than that, you're eating primarily the same type of foods. He just, you're manipulating the fat versus carbohydrate levels. And how do you feel? What do you find it difficult to maintain the ketogenic diet and how do you feel when you're on it versus when you're not? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:17:44       so for me, because I'm leanne obviously the, and I have a fast metabolism. I can do quito for a couple of weeks and feel pretty good. I've done it for as long as three months. Um, so I've done the full experiment and what happens is after about two or three weeks, my exercise tolerance and recovery starts to go down. So I start to Have less capacity to Do Like more glycolytic activities, explosive movements, weightlifting, um, even or sprinting, high intensity types of training. And um, and, and I start, my sleep starts actually deteriorate a little bit. That's one of the biggest things. So why would it be beneficial then? What's beneficial about it? Well, I think so too. Two things. Number one, not everybody has that response. A lot of people just feel better and If they're able to do it for a sustained period of time and they don't have that problem.

Speaker 1:          01:18:42       Number two, I, the way I'm trying to do it is kind of replicating what I think was a typical in the ancestral environment. So, um, it, most hunter gatherer cultures that we've studied a would have naturally had periods of food scarcity, so they're not always starving, but because they don't have a set with a live and on the corner or costco or whatever, they would have periods where they weren't successful in a hunt. So, you know, they would go without eating or they eat less. That's just built into our, our template I think. And so I've, I do a thing where I'm, you know, I'll do intermittent fasting for a period and I might do a week or two of ketosis and then I might just eat my normal diet for six weeks or two months after that. And then I might do another week of ketosis and I don't schedule it, I don't plan it, I just let my body tell me, you know, oh, kind of feels like all I want to do that now.

Speaker 1:          01:19:35       And are you doing blood tests? are you doing breath tests? How you monitoring your ketones? I totally, uh, so I have the blood ketone monitor and I'm from all the research that I've seen at this point. Breath ketone testing is not accurate at higher levels of ketosis. It's accurate at lower levels, but when you get into the therapeutic range around two point. Oh, one point five to two point. Oh, which is kind of the sweet spot for me than blood ketones are more accurate. And the problem with the blood ketone strips are super expensive, especially if you buy them just like at the drug store or something like that. Um, but, uh, I, if you, you can look around and try to find them in bulk and they, they're cheaper that way and, and frankly at this point, and I think that's true for most people once you get used to it, you know, and you've done it enough, you don't need to keep using them over and over, you just kind of know when you're going to be in ketosis when you're not.

Speaker 1:          01:20:28       And I've tracked my, my values and I've tracked, you know, I've treated hundreds of patients where we've done these kinds of experiments and this goes back to the discussion about ldl. So for me on a, on a ketogenic diet, you know, if I measure my on my typical diet, my ldl particle number is about $1,200. So I'll just briefly describe what that is because I think some people might not be familiar with that. So if you imagine that your, your blood, your blood stream is like a highway. The cars on the highway or the ldl particles and the passengers in the car or the cholesterol that are carried by the ldl particles. So for years we've measured the, the passengers, the cholesterol inside of the particle, and now most of the research suggests that it's actually the number of particles or cars on the road that is the biggest driver of heart disease risks, not the amount of cholesterol inside of them.

Speaker 1:          01:21:23       So you can measure this, their labcorp and quest, they all have a test panel called an nmr, um, where you can measure the number of particles that you have. And so my normal diet is around 11 or $1,200, which is technically it's high normal or you know, in a kind of intermediate range. I'm noT worried about that level. Um, but when I go to quito, my ldl goes above 2000, which is in the 99th percentile and, and high high risk range. Wow. So this is where I was talking before about getting to a point where we can be maybe a little more personalized in terms of the recommendations that we make because not everyone who goes quito experiences that, you know, some people do and some people don't. What do you think that is? Oh, it's just the one that, you know, for me, the quito type of diet, um, it, it affects my liquids in that way and know this is a much larger conversation around does that actually increase my risk of heart disease?

Speaker 1:          01:22:25       Again, I said before, we know that higher ldl on average in the general population does, but if, if like let's say I have a doppelganger know genetically identical to me in everywhere identical twin and that one is not eating healthy, not exercising, not sleeping, not doing anything to take care of himself, and he has an ldl p that's high and I have the ldl p that's high and they're exactly the same. Do we think that we're going to be at the same risk of heart disease just because that one number on the paper is exactly the same? That's the assumption that's made in conventional research literature. Right? But I think almost anybody just common sense would say, no, that's not true. There are many other factors that determine the risk of heart disease. So getting back to this thing. So for me with quito, one of the reasons, I mean the main reason I don't do it ongoing is I don't feel well when I keep doing it.

Speaker 1:          01:23:25       Like I said, number two, I don't like doing it long term and I think that's important. And number number three, I don't necessarily want to have an ldl p of 2000, but you do think there are some benefits to occasionally doing. I think that it was very natural for human beings to be in ketosis at least part of the time. And whether you enter into that by just fasting, um, or whether you do it with a ketogenic diet, I don't know that that really matters. I mean, fasting has some additional benefits above and beyond just ketosis, like autophagy which is a cellular cleanup and repair process that happens in a fasted state. Um, if you think about it, if fasting or being in a fasted state was a normal part of human evolution, it makes sense that certain processes would only happen in that fasted state.

Speaker 1:          01:24:13       It does make sense. But I would feel like when I'm talking to you based on your experience, I would avoid being in ketosis all together because it sounds like it sucks for, you know, it doesn't. Those first two weeks are really great and feel great. Yeah. And then it starts to shift over to dom d'agostino said that there's like a uh, so there's a, an adaptation period. Yeah. Usually three weeks is the full period for most people. But like I said, I've done a full, you know, longer experiments. So I know it wasn't just a question of me not being fat adapted. I think he was talking about several months in terms of like athletic performance when you were performance starts to. Yeah, I think that varies a lot from person to person. Also varies how quickly someone can get into and out of ketosis. I go into it very quickly.

Speaker 1:          01:24:57       For me, just the second, if I do one day of fasting or one day of quito on the second day, I'll generally be at one, one point two, which most people say is in a therapeutic range. And then by the third or fourth day I'll usually be at two without a lot of effort and deregulate your protein intake when you're doing a ketogenic diet as well to avoid the protein converting. Again, that's highly individual. From what I've seen. For me, protein doesn't seem to be that significant of a lever. I've tried, you know, I did an experiment where I was just fasting in the morning so I had no protein and then I would have three ounces of protein only with the salad at lunch and then I would have kind of normal sized portion of protein. So that's actually pretty low protein for someone of my size.

Speaker 1:          01:25:42       Um, and that. And then I've done it where I've just done quito where I've had protein for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It doesn't seem to make a big difference for me, but I have patients for whom that's a, that's actually as big of a leverage carbohydrate. And you know, I had tom bill you on the podcast and he was one of the founders of quest nutrition and he said one of those quest bars would knock them out of ketosis. But just because of the amount of protein, I'm like, that's crazy. Yeah. And I think they're only like, um, what is it, like 18 grams or something, somewhere in the range. That's why it's a, that's why it's so important for us to get over this idea that there's one approach that will work for everyone. It's just stupid. I know. You know robb wolf, have you ever seen robb wolf's experience that he does on his instagram and his wife?

Speaker 1:          01:26:22       They both eat the same thiNgs, a totally different, totally different results as far as their blood sugar and his wife metabolizes things far quicker than he does. It's really interesting. That's really interesting because you seem to people that lived together that they're eating the exact same foods. Yeah. And uh, and you know, That he's so fascinated by it himself. It makes an interesting too. I mean it's, it's so, um, it's so necessary for us to take that step because you see so much like, you know, wasted energy in my opinion of people arguing back and forth. And it's often based on like, you know, joe blow goes on a low carb diet. has a life changing experience and becomes like a almost religious zealot for the low carb lifestyle and assumes that because it had that effect on him that it's going to have that effect on everybody else and, and just starts proselytizing for low car.

Speaker 1:          01:27:18       Yes. Not recognizing that for someone else. For example, many of my female patients gone low carb and, and if, if they're like, you know, working and taking care of kids and doing crossfit several times a week, you know, that could be a disaster for them really might not work. And so, um, you know, we just gotta we gotta take the next step. Yeah, you have to take into account by a diversity. But uh, there's a lot of people that dismiss ketogenic diets because that's not what they've been promoting. That's a, that's an issue as well. Like you've gotta be real careful about someone who's not citing actual science when they're talking and dismissing the ketogenic diet. Like I read someone talking, saying that it was a fad and it's hard to get into ketosis that it rarely happens. I'm like, well, that's just not true.

Speaker 1:          01:28:04       That's actually factually wrong. Yeah, it's not hard at all and it happens all the time and I've been in it, I've done it many times. I'm not in it right now, but I do the same thing. But for me it's a set of boredom. Yeah, I get bored and I want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or something and then boom, I'm out. Yeah. Well again, I think that's, that's probably closer to the ancestral pattern of not being in a continually, um, but you know, there are some people who need to be in it continually, like a ketosis can be a life changing a intervention for a kid with epilepsy for example. And those kids benefit from being a deep ketosis. So they might actually even need exogenous ketones on top of the key to genic diet, but they can go from having, you know, 40 seizures in a day or being on like just brutal antiseizure meds which are horrible for kids. I mean the side effects are so bad to being completely off medication. We can ketogenetic diet and so for them that peanut butter, they're not gonna have that sandwich because it's going to cause

Speaker 2:          01:29:01       a seizure. What was unique in my experience was the cognitive benefits. I was like, this is really fascinating because I felt so much more clearheaded and from the fog of refined carbohydrates, but I think that that is a. I don't know if it's the same or very close if I just follow a low carb diet, not necessarily ketogenic, but eliminate refined carbohydrates but don't eliminate salads or fruit or things along those lines. Like if I want a pair, eat a pear, you know what I mean? But the very strict application of it. One of the first immediate things that I recognize is that my hunger is a very different thing when I'm hungry, it's not that big a deal. WhereAs when I was eating a large amount of refined carbohydrates, the hunger was ferocious. Yeah, yeah. It was almost like, like overwhelmed, like drums playing in the background

Speaker 1:          01:29:57       and that's the ketones because the brain can utilize. Ketones may even prefer key to glucose, and so when you're producing those ketones, it really does take the edge off of hunger and it also fuels

Speaker 2:          01:30:10       brain in an odd way. I mean, I find that before I do difficult tasks, mental tasks, I like to drink exogenous ketones, ketones, I like to take them. I think you're actually like it though. Yeah, I do. I don't mind. Yeah. What does that stuff, janice? Oh yeah. I liked them the best. It doesn't taste bad at all. I drink it before I work out. I like those. Yeah. I don't think they're bad. Yeah. You know, and I throw some alpha brain in there. I just shake it up and it actually tastes pretty good.

Speaker 1:          01:30:39       Yeah. Yeah. I think there's definitely a role for, for the ketogenic diet and for ketosis in general and you know, fasting, as I mentioned before, had some really interesting benefits above and beyond ketosis that I've been exploring a lot might work with patients. Um, have you heard of the fasting mimicking diet? No. Doctor valter longo. so, uh, dr longo was at usc center for longevity superstar scientist and he basically came up with this approach to get, you know, the idea was to get the benefits of fasting without doing a full water fast. And so it's a reduced calorie diet for three that's done for three to five days with specific macronutrient ratios. And he's done some really interesting research. Most of it is an animal, so you have to, you know, take that with a little bit of a grain of salt. But there has been some in humans as well.

Speaker 1:          01:31:32       And it's shown things like in animals with nms, just doing this, fasting mimicking diet has lead to regeneration of the myelin sheath and which is what breaks down in ms, which is just, you just don't see that, you know, no animals got, there's no dre will they have animal models of ms where they created an ms light condition in the animal in order to study it. Um, and they show, they've shown changes in the brain. You know, we're actually that read growing. And, and the reason for this, this, it's thought is that this fasting can promote stem cell regeneration so you can actually through fasting, rebuild certain parts of your body according to this research. So, uh, and then there was the autophagy which I mentioned before which is like almost, you can think of it as like a cellular recycling or clean up or repair process that happens in that fast at state. And so if you look in the research literature, it's really fascinating because they're more older, you know, older studies. There hasn't been as much research until recently on fasting, but fasting has been shown to be a cure for all kinds of different conditions. Like, you know, severe rheumatoid arthritis, patient can fast and then be completely symptom free. And of course they can't keep that up. You can't just fast forever. You obviously will die. But that alone tells us something interesting about fasting and about food and how food is impacting those conditions.

Speaker 2:          01:32:56       Yeah, that is absolutely fascinating. I'm the consumption of carbohydrates. Dom d'agostino put something up about it recently, a low sugar and carbs that they're closer and closer to connecting sugar and carbs to cancer.

Speaker 1:          01:33:11       This is a pretty controversial area and I'll say right off the top that I don't consider myself to be an expert. Um, so, uh, you know, uh, I'll probably just pass on this, but I think there's certainly enough research pointing in that direction to continue to look at that and they're, you know, even he probably talked about this, but drugs like metformin which limit the availability of glucose are being studied even by the nih, you know, very traditional mainstream scientific organizations as a therapy therapeutics for cancer as is ketogenic diet, dom studying non and others are as well. Um, but I think it'S a little too early to, to, to say that all cancer is caused by high, high blood glucose level. The antibodies saying, all right,

Speaker 2:          01:33:57       I think they're, they're saying there's a strong correlation between the two. Now when you look at the overall american diet and the number of chronic diseases and all the different various things that we have, and you correlate all these factors, when you think about sedentary lifestyle, you think about the lack of sleep, and then of course you think about diet and exercise. Um, when do you think people are gonna recognize or how do we get people to recognize that what they're eating and what the average person is eating is not what the body's designed for. And this may very well be what has triggered this whole cascade of effects.

Speaker 1:          01:34:38       That's the trillion dollar question, literally trillion dollar question because we spend three point $2,000,000,000,000 on healthcare a year. Um, so, you know, I, I think there's an easy way in a hard way to get there. So the easy way is that we continue to raise awareness through books and, and things

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       like this. And you know, um, we, we make proactive changes to the healthcare system that support the most important intervention. So let's use an example again, I'm imagine it so, so you go into the doctor right now, let's say you're one of those 100 million people that has, you know, type two diabetes or prediabetes and they, they, they test your blood sugar, they say your fasting glucose is 96 joe and your hemoglobin a one c is five point five. Good news. That's normal. Well, yeah, okay. It's in the normal range but it's in the high end of the normal range in the current system. They'll just tell you it's normal. They might maybe maybe not make any kind of dietary recommendations and then send you on your way. And the idea is we're not going to pay attention to this until it's not normal. You know, we're not going to pay attention to this until you actually do have prediabetes or diabetes.

Speaker 3:          01:35:48       And um, so the, wait until you have that. And then of course the longer that you wait to treat it, the harder it is to reverse. And then you. And then when, when, once they do find that you have it, they just give you a drug rather than, you know, give you any kind of real support to make diet changes. So even if the doctor is, it does know what to do or what to tell you about diet, which they often don't because they just don't have a lot of training in that area. And it's also how few people really have the contents of their body analyzed. How many people actually get blood work done, right? Well, I'd say 80 percent don't even know they have prediabetes, but let's assume that they do and let's assume they get to the doctor and let's assume the doctor even knows what to tell them.

Speaker 3:          01:36:31       Right? If they tell them that are they, does that gonna be enough to make that person successful in changing their diet? And especially not if their gut biome is program to crave that sugar and they have low willpower especially, they get very little sleep at work all the time. All those factors, those factors. And we know they like most importantly, information alone is not enough to change behavior. We, I said that before, that's well established scientifically, Just telling someone, hey, you should eat a healthier diet. You know, one percent of people are going to be able to retake that information and act on it successfully, especially over the long term. But let's imagine a different scenario. Let's imagine you can go into the doctor. Same thing. They test your blood sugar. It's, you know, high normal fasting glucose, high normal agency, and they sit down, they say, look, joe, and this is obviously happening in an appointment in this longer than eight minutes, right?

Speaker 3:          01:37:22       They sit down, they say, well, you're not prediabetic yet. um, but your blood sugar's starting to creep up. And I'm worried that if we don't do something now, you're going to get, you're going to become prediabetic and eventually diabetic. so, you know, I could give you a drug, but that's just putting a bandaid on the problem. So what I'm going to do instead is I'm gonna hook you up with our health coach and nutritionist and she, he or she is going to create a recipe for you meal plan. They're going to come to your house. They're going to clean out your pantry and get up, get rid of all the bad foodS. They're going to go shopping with you and show you actually exactly what you need to buy. They're going to help you set up these meal plans and give you recipes so that you know exactly what you should be doing or they're going to set you up with this meal planning service that we work with and I'm also gonna set you up.

Speaker 3:          01:38:09       You're going to get a gym membership and you're going to get set up with a personal trainer at that gym and so that you can start getting, you know, becoming more physically active. We're going to give you this, a online class that talks about sleep hygiene and how to get better night's sleep. It's a six week program. You do it for half hour a day, no problem. And here's the good news, joe. This is all going to be covered by your insurance. You're not going to have to pay for any of this that you know. That is totally possible. And not only that, is there any doubt that if even if we spent $10,000, let's say, which is more than that would cost even including the health coach and the fees for the gym and the fees for the personal trainer. If we spent that amount of money right up front, we could put that per get that person's blood sugar back to normal level, prevent them from ever getting type two diabetes in the first place, give them way more confidence in their own ability to take care of themselves and prevent disease, make them feel better and probably every other way and save the healthcare system $640,000 over the next 45 years.

Speaker 3:          01:39:18       We could have that. There's nothing stopping that from happening. The real question is how do you get someone to act? That's the question. That's true. Inspiration. I said with the health coach so that it's not actually. I mean this is well defined. We had. There's so much research on behavior change and evidence based principles that support behavior change. So there there are techniques like motivational interviewing, coaching to strengths. I'm a coach into strengths. Yeah. So that, that means helping people identify and, and work with their strengths rather than trying to fix what's broken. Um, motivational interviewing is what would be an example of that. Let's you have a person works a regular normal job and they've got a big gut and don't want to lose. We have a, you have a, it's shifting the focus around from what's wrong, which is really disempowering. Like I can't do that.

Speaker 3:          01:40:10       I'm, I'm, this way. I'd have no willpower or whatever to helping them become aware of certain personality traits or characteristics that they can then use to make the change that they want to make. Motivational interviewing is like this. Imagine a woman who's 55, you know, finds out that she has type two diabetes and the doctor's like, you should eat a better diet and she's, she would like to, but she's overworked and tired and it feels overwhelming and, and she's just not really finding the motivation to do that in this, you know, but she has grandkids. She loves her grandkids. She wants to see them grow up. She wants to be able to play with them without becoming blind and immobile from type two diabetes and so the the per the health coach is trained in motivational interviewing, can help her help that, that patient to be able to tie that, those deeper values and goals and motivations with the health goal so that it's not just eating a healthy diet for the, for the sake of eating a healthy diet, it's eating a healthy diet because I really want to see my grandkids grow up and be able to play with them.

Speaker 3:          01:41:18       OkAy, so and then there are these principles of behavior change that are, that are totally well established. So one is shrink. The change is a colloquial way of putting it. Like let's say you're going to start a meditation practice. The way to not do it is to say, okay, so start doing that. Do an hour of meditation a day. Good luck with that. You know, that's gonna fail in 99 point nine percent of the cases. The way to do it might be, okay, step one, not even that step one, download the headspace app on your phone. That's it, that's your first step, you know, step two, but get a meditation cushion. That's it. Step three, you know, open the headspace app and do your first two minute meditation. I mean, the headspace app is actually built in this way where they start, you very small and you build up gradually over time because they know about those principles of behavior change. Uh, we know that behavior change works better in community. Um, this is, uh, this is a head spinner to obesity. Some people have argued is a contagious disease because people who have friends that are obese are more likely to be obese themselves.

Speaker 2:          01:42:28       You know what, that, that makes a lot of sense. And, uh, here's an example of something, one of the reasons why that makes a lot of sense. Uh, we just did this thing sober october me and uh, yeah, and our shaffir tom score, bert kreischer and I, we took 15 hot yoga classes, no booze, no weed for a month, but because we were doing it all together and we kept checking in on each other, it was very motivating and um, and no one's strayed and we all were doing it too. We knew that we had, we had all, we had a responsibility, we have responsibility to the group and that we, we knew that we're motivating each other as well as pushing each other and talking shit to each other and making fun of each other, which is what we do nationally. But at the end of it we were like, wow, that was great. like there's something to that. Like a lot of us were like, I'm never doing yoga again for yoga and I'm getting drunk for a week. but the real takeaway from it was there was some measurable motivation and inspiration from having three friends doing it with me.

Speaker 3:          01:43:35       Absolutely. And that's again been improving in the science and even just having one person like a health coach who can play that role and be accountable, they can help you get in touch with the real motivation for doing it. They can actually design a program for you that's life likely to succeed instead of fail or perhaps online groups. There's got to be online groups to get involved with. We have the knowledge and the technology to do this. And it's not, It doesn't take a long time. You can retrain a health coach in six months or a year. They don't need to have nine years of premedical, you know, traIning and biological sciences and all this. They just need to be trained in behavior change. You know, they need to be people who can form a good relatIonship with somebody else and build that trust and rapport.

Speaker 3:          01:44:18       They need to have some knowledge, of course, of diet and lifestyle and stuff. But like I said, imagine that you go into your doctor and they actually hook you up with someone like that who has all that training. Um, if you think of how the healthcare population as like a pyramid, yeah, at the top of the pyramid you've got, you know, people who are really sick and who were in the hospital or in some kind of acute care setting, they absolutely need intensive support from the conventional medical system. Then you go down, you've got another 25 percent of people who have some kind of pretty debilitating chronic disease where they need to be seeing a doctor regularly, but then in the bottom 70 percent you've got a lot of people who are just overweight. They're tired, they're not sleeping very well. They got some gut issues.

Speaker 3:          01:45:02       They got some skin problems. I. My argument is that those people can be really well served by well trained health coaches and nutritionists who can work intensively with them on diet, lifestyle and behavior change and we know that those changes are the single most important step we can take to prevent and reverse disease. But we also know that just telling people about it doesn't work. You have to create that support system. Well, our whole food system is so crazy because it's so fraught with peril everywhere you go. It's a goddamn minefield. Exactly. You're trying to eat a healthy diet. You have to go way out of your way to find what you can consume. Oh, there it is over there. Whereas if you just want to eat a shitty diet, it's everywhere in front of you. The the vast majority of the food that's available to us is not healthy.

Speaker 3:          01:45:51       Yeah. Yeah. I mean if, if you took somebody from our culture and drop them into like, there's this group called the cmo manet and Bolivia. They're a hunter gatherer group that's still follows their traditional lifestyle. if you took someone from here, drop them in there and just made them live that way, they'd get healthy because they wouldn't have any choice. You know, they would eat what was there and they'd, they'd be living outdoors and they wouldn't have ipads. They're staying up and looking at it until two in the morning and you know, they would be healthy, but likewise they'd get killed by a jaguar or they'd get. Yeah, exactly. It's definitely possible, but if you took one of those people and you drop them into here like woodland hills or New York city or san francisco or anywhere else, is there any question that what's going to happen? They're the same exact thing that happens to all of us in this, in this modern. Well, we've seen that with the nun when the. When the nun. One of the more fascinating things about studying the nun was how small the number of people

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       that got cancer was such an incredibly small number and they essentially had no vegetables. They were eating fats from seals and wail and whatever. They could consume. Extremely limited diet environment. Yeah, very harsh environment and. But they had adapted to it and then when western America came into their lives in terms of like cigarettes, shitty food, alcohol, refined carbohydrates, cancer rates

Speaker 3:          01:47:20       through the roof, just through the roof. Which is fascinating because their jeans hadn't changed. Absolutely the same genes. They're not going to change in one generation or even two or three. Yeah, it's, it's horrible. Have you seen west and price? You familiar with his work? I know the name, so it was, he was a dentist back in like the 19 twenties and thirties, and he wrote a book called nutrition and physical degeneration. And what he as a dentIst, his main interest was why did, why did so many cavities, that doesn't seem natural, right? It doesn't seem normal that were designed to just develop rotten teeth. You thought this is stupid. So I'm going to go around and study all of these traditional cultures all over the world. And first I want to find out do they have cavities and dental decay and, and like a narrowing of the dental arch and changes in facial structure that we have in the industrialized world.

Speaker 3:          01:48:12       And the second question is, if not, what is the common element, you know, with all of these cultures, it's different than our culture. And in his book he shows pictures. So first of all, the answer to the question was, no, it's not normal for humans to develop cavities and rotten teeth. I mean, how could it be? How could we survive in the natural world if our teeth are all falling out? Um, so he, he went and he took pictures of these people all around the world, like in africa, the, my side, a hunter gatherer, people, uh, people living in a remote part of Switzerland, isolated up in the hills that had maintain their traditional diet and lifestyle and all of them had these beautiful teeth, big wide round faces, dent, you know, wide dental arches, you know, all of these signs of health. But he also in the book had pictures of people from those same areas that had switched to move to the city, you know, switch to modern lifestyle within one generation.

Speaker 3:          01:49:09       You see people with these wide faces, big healthy teeth smiling on one side of the page. And on the other side of the page you see people with these narrow faces like mine, uh, you know, rotten teeth, you know, totally it's crooked teeth and the kind of dental problems that we all have where most of us get braces and all this stuff. And that happened in just one generation of switching from a traditional diet to a modern either faced then, uh, so vitamin k two and, and a lot number of vitamins are responsible for facial development. So if you, uh, if you look in the book of a western prices, um, pictures, you see most people

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       in the, in, in those traditional worlds have these broad, healthy dental arches. And then, uh, in our culture because of nutrient deficiencies and we're not eating the healthy nutrient dense foods are faces get more narrow, our chins received, we have our mouths become more crowded, which is why many people can't fit the number of normal adult teeth in their mouth because they're dental arches so narrowly. So that's all from that nutritional deficiencies. Absolutely. Why I had to get, I had to get adult teeth pulled when I was a teenager because my mouth didn't have enough room for all of my adult teeth.

Speaker 1:          01:50:26       Does the rest of your family have similar facial structure? Um, yeah. Largely. Yeah. I mean, you can check this out. It's really interesting things to do in the airport. I liked it, you know, you just look at people's faces. Often you'll see like the chin is really receded and not, you know, not like a strong, you'll see in a narrow face like mine. Um, and if you, you might see a, a person from africa or someone who's more connected to their traditional diet lifestyle, they'll typically have a rounder face, a more full face, broader dental arch. They'll have straight teeth with wider, wider teeth. And you can, you can, anyone can do this. Anyone can see and look and you can almost predict how long has that person been away from their traditional diet and lifestyle. Wow. I never knew that. You know, that's a fascinating point.

Speaker 1:          01:51:15       It's a big variable in martial arts and the ability to take a punch. Well your face is, it's pretty round. You have a broader, but it's not just what you're eating is. My mom is very wide. Have a thick mom spiLling pit bull. Yeah. Well it's probably part of why you're probably a good performer is that you've got that structure that supports it. Yeah. I'm sure it has something to do with it genetically. Um, but the, the ability to take a punch is I think directly related to the size of your face. Yeah. Yeah. Guys with smaller jaws and smaller faces, they have a much harder time getting hit. I wouldn't last long. Well, like samoans are the best at it. Yeah. It was just such a pro. For example, instruction. Weston price has a lot of pictures from people in the south pacific and that region, you know, examples of these beautiful.

Speaker 1:          01:52:07       You should check it. You would love the book. It's really amazing to see the juxtaposition of those traditional faces with the modern ones. It's like you, I mean, a picture's worth a thousand words, right? You just look at those pictures and you're just like, oh my god. TotallY makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. It is a very weird. When you think about what we're doing to the human body and when you're talking about the diabetes levels that you're talking about, or prediabetes and chronic disease and all the different issues and 40 percent obesity rate and the all these different factors, it's an epidemic that's sweeping through the entire nation and it's largely,

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       other than health fads, a weight loss videos. It's like peripherAlly examined. I like to call it a slow motion plague. Whoa. Because like the bubonic plague, you know, which was a fast motion play. It threatens us in the same way. Like it's literally threatening the health of future generations. It's shortening our lifespan. It's destroying our quality of life. It's a big one. Yeah. And if you stay alive, the quality of life is being devastated. Or as a recent article that came out saying just that, like is it was, it was, it was a paper that looked at, um, what's happening in our older years and saying, yeah, we have a long lifespan, but our quality of life has significantly declined in those later years because we're burdened by all of these chronic diseases. You know, the average Something like a one in five are two and five elderly people over 65 are taking more than five medications.

Speaker 3:          01:53:41       It's a huge problem. And this is the thing you hit on this point, so I want to reiterate it because it's super important. We have accepted chronIc diseases, normal because it's so common, but there's a really important difference between common and normal. What's common is, you know, it's not necessarily normal, it's now, it's now common for people to have chronic disease, but that's not normal. How do we know? Again, the tsimané that's a. It's a subsistence farming hunter gatherer population in Bolivia and recently there's been some articles in the New York times about them. This, some anthropologists, medical anthropologists who've gotten and doctors and researchers have gone down there to study them. They wanted to see that. It's like this is one of the last places on earth where people are still living pretty traditional diet and lifestyle, so we better study this quickly, you know, to see what's normal, what's truly normal for humans.

Speaker 3:          01:54:33       Not common but normal. Yeah. So they eat, you know, paleo type of diet. You know, fruits and vegetables, some meat and fish, nuts and seeds, some plantings, other kinds of starches. They walk an average of 17,000 steps a day, which is about eight miles. So quite a bit. They live in sync with the natural rhythms of light and dark. You know, they don't have a lot of artificial light exposure like we do. They sleep seven, eight hours. In fact, the researchers are trying to ask them about insomnia. They didn't even have a word for it. And their language, they work. Yeah, they, you know, they're living their normal normal. That's as closest we're going to get to a normal human population. Right. So they studied, they studied, um, they, they did blood markers on them for heart disease, but not only that, they did scans ct scans of their heart, you know, the cfa had calcification of the arteries and they found that the rate of heart disease in this population was 80 percent lower than it was in than it is in the us.

Speaker 3:          01:55:31       Eighty percent lower. Okay. Nine and 10 to manet adults that they studied had absolutely no plaque buildup in their arteries, which means they have virtually no risk of a heart attack as far as we understand it. And you know, before anyone who's listening to this says, oh yeah, that's just because hunter gathers all die when they're 35 years old. you know that familiar argument. Well, this study included people between the ages of 40 and 94 years old. What's more, tHe researchers estimated that the average simani 80 year old had the same vascular age as an american in his mid fifties. Whoa. There's no almost no cognitive disorders or alzheimer's disease in the [inaudible]. So that's a really clear example of what happens when you give human beings the right inputs and they're not exposed to all this crap that we're exposed to. They live long and healthy lives that are virtually free of chronic disease and that's despite the fact that they have much higher rates of infection than we do.

Speaker 3:          01:56:38       They live on a river, they've got parasites galore, like all of them have parasites. Yeah, and yet they still are healthier than us in almost every way you can measure it. They have lower body mass index, lower blood pressure, lower weight. They don't get heart disease. They don't get alzheimer's and dementia, which is not like climbing up the list of, of, of causes of death and tripling. I'm glad you brought up alzheimer's because I read something recently. I didn't read the whole article. I just read the title of it was connecting alzheimer's to gut bacteria. Yeah, absolutely. There's a strong that this, this actually something referred to as the gut brain access, which is this very well known connection between the gut and the brain and it goes both ways. So you know, the gut can influence the brain strongly and the brain can influence the gut strongly.

Speaker 3:          01:57:27       So, I mean, my, my point is just that what you said, when are we going to realize that just these changes, you know, making these changes is what we need to do to prevent and reverse chronic disease. And, uh, we have these examples of people like that that show us very clearly that it's the way we're living, not our genes that are causing this chronic disease epidemic. So the easy way would be to, you know, write books about it, you know, have shows like this, keep educating people and doing that. And that's what I'm hoping for and that's why I wrote my book. Um, but the hard way is that our system fails, that it becomes so overburdened by the rising rates of chronic disease and the unsustainable expenses of that, that it, it basically falls apart and it becomes, you know, we respond in a kind of to it as the crisis that it really is because it becomes apparent at that point that there are way that we've been doing it has not been working and that we desperately need to find a new way.

Speaker 3:          01:58:32       Um, and that's another possibilitY. And which one you think is gonna take place, kind of depends on whether you're a glass is half empty or glass is half full type of person. Yeah. Well, from your own personal point of view, if you're listening to this, don't rely on all those things to happen. Just try to go out and do something about this for yourself. And I think that's how it's really gonna you know my, my personal view is it's going to be a little of both actually. So I think what's going to happen is you're going to start seeing some big changes on the more local grassroots level. So we've already seen stuff like this. Examples of be a. there's a group called iora health and denver to primary care group and they're, they're reversing type two diabetes with health coaches now. They still see the doctor, but they work primarily with a health coach who does all those things that I just said.

Speaker 3:          01:59:22       I wasn't making that up. They actually go to their house. They do pantry clean outs, they go shopping with them. They teach them how to eat well, but more than that, they just provide the, the. They're like the accountability buddy. You know the person they call them every week they, they visit their house. So how are you doing? You know, how can I help? And, and that person's totally empowered. TheY make these changes and they're reversing it without, without drugs or with a minimum of medication. There's a mark hyman who's a doctor, pioneer and functional medicine. He recently, um, they tapped him to start the center for functional medicine at the cleveland clinic, one of the most prestigious international medical institutions always on the forefront of the, the, the newest changes in medicine. And when they first started, they were in this tiny little space, but within a few months they had like 3000 patients on their wait list and they moved to a 17,000 square foot space and glickman tower, which takes up the whole second floor of this building and cleveland clinic.

Speaker 3:          02:00:20       And they've got patients from nine countries on the waitlist coming from all over the world to do the, to do functional medicine because they, you know, people know that the system as it's set up isn't really effective for chronic disease. It's fantastic. I mean, if I get hit by a bus, I want to go to the hospital, right? I mean antibiotics revolutionize how we treat infections. You have anesthesia made surgery like, you know, imagine surgery without anesthesia. It was like a bottle of booze. I'm anti sepsis, like cleaning the surgical theaters is dramatically reduced infections. You've got radiology, radiologic images, so that's improved diagnosis of disease. So conventional medicine is amazing and it's here to stay and we need it, but it's just the wrong tool for the job for long for chronic disease. Nutrition, for managing, yeah, using a hammer, going around everywhere with a hammer, you know, expecting not to work. Hammer works really well when you're pounding a nail and it doesn't work as well with a screw or you know, with something else. So I mean cleveland clinic, it's just an amazing proof of concept for functional medicine. Then rob wolf, who, you know, you know, we both know, he dId some incredible work with the city of reno where, and the first responders were, they, they projected that just by doing this intervention.

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       So what happened was that the, uh, firefighters and police cops were, were having heart attacks and strokes and because of the way the pension plans, you know, are set up if they have to, if the city of reno has to medically retire these, these people, they're gonna spend like millions of dollars over the course of their lifetime taking care of them. so rob went in there with this other group, specialty health, you got them on a good, you know, paleo type of diet, lower carb diet, got them doing some more physical activity. Well the estimate that they save the city of reno, something like 25 or $30 million dollars just with this simple intervention. We're doing a pilot now with the berkeley fire department, with our clinic with a similar kind of goal. So I think you're going to see all these kind of examples of things happening on local community level because you can make changes more quickly that way.

Speaker 1:          02:02:32       And then over time some of those things are going to scale up and you know, we're going to start seeing them maybe on the state level or the local government level and then eventually at some point that's going to get attention of people on the federal level who are looking around and going, oh my god, it's 20, 25 or 20, 30 healthcare expenditures are 35 or 40 percent of gdp. This is completely unsustAinable. Like we're, we're not even going to exist as a country in 25 years unless we do something about this. So I kinda think it's gonna gonna gonna go like that. Well, I hope it goes towards the, the, the model of the cleveland clinic where businesses sort of rise up and take advantage of this opportunity to get people healthy and to profit. I mean, it seems like that's the best way to make things happen.

Speaker 1:          02:03:16       Make, makes, make it a business or someone can profit off of it, you know, and as long as it's affordable for the vast majority of people, if it's not unreasonable. Well that's the thing. And, you know, rob has talked about this a lot for years, um, if you look at economies of scale and you looked at things like micro microprocessors and dna testing, you know, the first human genome sequence was like a bill costs like $500,000,000 right now you can just go out and pay 200 bucks to have the genome sequenced. And you know, microprocessors when they were first introduced to computers were as big as the room and um, you know, millions of dollars and now anyone can go buy a computer for a few hundred bucks while your phone is many times stronger than is from nasa and the 1960 [inaudible]. But we don't see that kind of innovation in healthcare.

Speaker 1:          02:04:03       Like we see expenses going up instead of going down every year. It gets more expensive. I feel like there's a lot of hijacking going on with big money and big money in, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. They don't want anything. They didn't do this, this, this gravy train of money going right into their pockets when people have disease. And that's the key point. I mean, uh, rob, uh, we did a, what we call it, a rally to end chronic disease the other night, and then rob came and spoke and so did mark hyman from cleveland clinic and a few others, and in rob's talk he mentioned that healthcare should essentially be free if we used,

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       If, if we allowed the same forces to that microprocessor. Microprocessors go from being extremely expensive, extremely cheap. Dna testing go from being extremely expensive to extremely cheap. If we allowed those same forces to work in on healthcare, healthcare would be extremely affordable. The problem is, as you pointed out, we have a lot of misaligned incentives, so insurance companies, for example, they only benefit when the overall healthcare expenditures rise. So the, the more procedures are ordered, tests are ordered, you know, treatments are prescribed. The more they know the insurance company benefit. That seems counterintuitive to people because you would think that

Speaker 2:          02:05:19       paying for insurance and the insurance company is hoping that nothing goes wrong because then they'll have to pay out far more than that.

Speaker 3:          02:05:25       Paying. Yeah. There's a great book called catastrophic care that I recommend for anyone by david goldhill for anyone who is interested in, so it really pulls the curtain back on the whole system and how it's set up. Then you've got, of course, pharmaceutical companies. How is it set of the why? Why do insurance companies benefit from, from things going wrong? They, as the, as the whole edifice or the whole system of healthcare grows, they benefit because they're, uh, their recipient. They're involved in all of those transactions. Oh, okay. And then you have big pharma that um, is basically, you know, their incentive is to sell more drugs and they're for profit corporations and their duty is to make a profit for shareholders and that's how they do it. And so I'm selling more drugs is not always in the same. It aligned with the interest of patients or even have doctors. Well, the real issue to me

Speaker 2:          02:06:23       that stands out as an example of that is these stupid fucking commercials that they have for pharmaceutical drugs where people are having the best time ever when you're looking at them and like, how is this is so deceptive. You're, you're showing me like best case scenario, grandpa running, pushing the bike and the little kids laughing and everyone's having the time of their life like, oh, I want the time of my life. How do I get in on that?

Speaker 3:          02:06:45       Tell the last 15 or 30 seconds, which is like

Speaker 2:          02:06:48       this drug may cause you know, explosive diarrhea, anal bleeding, eyeballs fall out, your feet don't work. It's quite seriously. Go on for like 15 seconds. What was that one that we saw the other day? Jake humira. Yeah. What is that stuff? It was for members. She said it's like 120 grand for crap. Crappy titus and death is a side effect of that. Drug death, suicidal thoughts. Contact your physician and he'll tell you a fuck yourself. Wake him up. Wake him up in the middle of the night here. Give me some volume on this. We could hear this when I was doing okay. I thought I was doing okay too, but I'm not looking at was. She's managing humira is for people to still have symptoms of moderate to severe crones disease. Clinical studies, the majority of people on humira saw significant symptom

Speaker 4:          02:07:35       relief, maybe achieved remission can tell you what significant means. Tuberculosis, serious, sometimes fatal infections and cancers including lymphoma, have happened, have blood, liver and nervous system problems, serious allergic reactions and new or worsening heart failure before treatment. Get tested for tb. Tell your doctor if you've been to areas where certain fungal infections are common and if you've had tb. Hepatitis b are prone to infections or have flu like symptoms or sores. Don't start humira. If you have an infection, just managing your symptoms. Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:08:07       kill it right there. Why is that lady so fucking sweet and cheery? What she's talking about? Eminent death and the music just is not. It is not fair and look, the woman is on a tv set to like she's a successful producer on a television set. What a bizarre choice for what she does for a living, like watcher will kill the volume, but watch her wander around the office. They're like, who the fuck works a tv show like this is? We're supposed to relate to this lady. How manY people work on the set? Look at her. She's got a folder. She goes, she goes, yeah, because even though she has to do with crohn's disease, what you eat, she's going to fucking die in an explosive, imploding, rectal or disaster. get an infection. That would be totally, you know, not not a threat for you or anyone else, but because they had taken a drug that globally suppresses their immune system can kill you.

Speaker 1:          02:09:03       Yeah. That, that whole thing, like if you're, you know, if you have an infection, don't take it. Like, what? Wait a minute. Aren't those pretty common, the fuck are you saying like kind of try not to get in fact don't get an infection while you're taking humira. It's like, do you ever try to get an infection? I mean, how do you not try to get an infection? Yeah, this, but this is what kills me is that bizarre choice of her being some sort of a director or producer of a television show, like they were supposed to relate. Well, she is so successful and maybe maybe if you take humira, you could also become a producer of a television. There was another one abilify that killed and it was a antidepressant that you give to people that are suicidal while taking antidepressants. Yeah, like what? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:09:46       Hey. Hey. Yeah, let's talk about abilify. It's one of, I think it's the sixth or seventh most prescribed drug in the us. It's an anti psychotic. Okay. So if those two things don't, aren't, are not resonating and there's a reason for that. We don't have that many psychotics in this country where abilify could be, you know, only uses an anti psychotic. Give me some volume. Let's hear this carry on. But other days I still struggled with my depression. I was handling it, but sometimes it's just a cartoon. I've been feeling stuck for a long time, so I talked to my doctor and she added abilify to my antidepressant. She said it could help with my depression and that some people had symptom improvement as early as one to two weeks. I'm glad I talked to her. I wiSh I'd done it sooner. Now I feel more in control

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       of my new for everyone. Doctor, if your depression worsens or you have unusual changes in behavior or thoughts of suicide, antidepressants can increase these in children, teens, and young adults. elderly dementia, patients taking abilify have an increased risk of death or stroke. Call your doctor if you have high fever, stiff muscles and confusion to address a possible life threatening condition, or if you have uncontrollable muscle movements as these could become permanent blood sugar has been reported with abilify and medicines like it and in extreme cases can lead to coma or death. Other risks include increased cholesterol, weight gain decreases in white blood cells, which can be serious, dizziness on standing, seizures, trouble swallowing, and impaired judgement or motor skills. The person was always hanging over me. That bitch, a depressed depression is a concern. If you take this shit. Most of that commercial was telling start where they're talking to, you cut the segment of the commercial where the lady comes out, the doctor comes out, show where the lady doctor is, because that's like halfway in the lady doctor comes out at third and two thirds is the lady doctor say you're gonna fucking die.

Speaker 4:          02:11:47       Wait

Speaker 3:          02:11:47       is break this down because this is a drug that's added to a prescription of someone who's already taking any depressants to prevent suicidal thoughts or. But then one of the first side effects they said to look out for it. Suicidal thoughts? Yeah. What? maybe there'll be a third drug that people who are already on antidepressants and abilify can take for the suicidal thoughts that abilify wasn't able to get rid of from the original antidepressant. Yeah. Maybe we're just being cynical and depressed. We just need to trust in that cartoon lady with a great voice. Is amnesia. So loss. I mean this is a good example. We've all heard this term evidence based, right? yeah, and the idea is that conventional medicine is evidenced based and everything else is not. Well, that's total bs because this an abilify is a great example. It's an anti psychotic, that's what it was approved for, for psychosis and yes, we have a lot of, I mean recent events indicate that we do have quite a few psych psych, psychotic people, um, mass shootings, et cetera, but not that many, you know, not enough to make abilify that the seventh leading a drug on a sales basis.

Speaker 3:          02:12:59       That's insane. That's an insane number. So what abilify is prescribed off label, so off label means a way of using the drug that has never been a studier or approved by the fda for that particular purpose. So it's using a drug in a way that was not originally studied. How is that legal? It's legal. Doctors have the authority to prescribe medications off label as long as they're fda approved, fda approved for something that's so vast. Majority of abilify prescriptions therefore are label, which means they've never been studied or shown to be safe or effective for the conditions that it's being prescribed for.

Speaker 2:          02:13:38       So your doctor could legally prescribe you birth control pills? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:13:43       I mean it would be frowned upon and maybe if they did that enough and it was causing problems, they would, they would have to justify why they were doing it, but it's the missing key to abilify

Speaker 2:          02:13:52       for men, gay female birth control pills, like, oh wow, look at this.

Speaker 3:          02:13:59       Well, it also means they can use it in a population that hasn't been studied for. So for example, a drug has been studied and approved for adults. Did you see that? It said not safe, you know, it shouldn't be used for children and the elderly because it's never been studied, but that doesn't mean it's not being prescribed for children or the elderly. It's still definitely is. But you know, antidepressants have been shown to cause to suicidal ideation in adolescents and teenagers in particular, and yet they are still often used in that, in that group, even though they were never studied or approved for that

Speaker 2:          02:14:30       population. What is this one, jamie? A bill, a bill top selling year seven

Speaker 3:          02:14:37       below the top selling. Sorry. It's a toxin while you're driving. It's not the number seven. It's a silly me.

Speaker 2:          02:14:45       So the top selling drug is an anti psychotic, is that real? Is real, but is it still the top selling drug will whatever, let's not even look. But in 2014 it was the top selling drug that is crazy, has become the best selling drug in the United States.

Speaker 3:          02:15:05       The alarms about the dangerous and sometimes deadly side effects of anti psychotics affecting children and the elderly among others have been mounting for years.

Speaker 2:          02:15:14       Wow, that's terrifying. Yeah. And many of these symptoms could be directly related to gut biome gut bacteria and you might be able to nip it in the bud with a change in diet, uh, with addressing the sedentary lifestyle rigorous exercise. So let, let me tell you asked all these things. Meantime, it seems like what you're prescribing like, oh, come on. It can't be that easy. Let me tell you a story. It's actually the first chapter in my book. It's about a kid named leo that I treated my clinic furious back. He's eight years old, eight years old. When he came to see me,

Speaker 3:          02:15:53       we're like a rack when they, when they came to the office because they, you know, he had, they were just totally worn down. He would throw these epic tantrums where he'd be screaming and crying and riding on the floor for just the most random stuff, like trying to get his shoes tied is they were going out the door or you know, not cutting the crust off his bread sandwich and just the right way or getting a stay on his favorite tee shirt. He had a super limited diet. He had only a handful of foods. All of them processed and refined like toaster waffles, bread, crackers, cookies, etc. Um, you know, they were concerned about nutrient deficiency, but every time they tried to reintroduce, like to introduce a different food, he would go ballistic and they didn't have the energy to fight him at every meal.

Speaker 3:          02:16:37       He was really rigid about his behavior and environment. So like everything had to be just right. If the toys in his room or range in just the right way, he, he'd fly off the handle desks in this classroom. You know, just the right way. He'd fly off the handle. He was really anxious in unfamiliar environments, so it's hard for them to leave the house for even a few hours, much less travel or go on vacations. I mean, this seems extreme, but there are a lot of kids with these kinds of behavioral disorders now. He was not, you know, he's not alone. Um, so they took him to see doctors locally and they started with the primary care doctor, then went to psychiatrist and then several behavioral disorder specialists actually down here at usc or ucla and uh, you know, first diagnosed on the autism spectrum and then eventually ocd and something called sensory processing disorder, which is like on the autism spectrum where they're really sensitive to scent scent, sense input, touch, you know, sound cetera.

Speaker 3:          02:17:39       So, um, they, the doctors, uh, you know, they were relieved at first to have these diagnoses, but very quickly it became apparent that they were just labeled sort of symptoms. it wasn't anything that actually gave them information about what to do. And then the doc when asked the doctor what the treatment was, the answer was medication. So they first started with adderall, which you mentioned earlier, then rhydlin both stimulants and then eventually antidepressants, which again have not really been approved. It's safe or effective in kids and they did help at least a little bit with some of the symptoms, but then he got a lot of brutal side effects, got pain, dry mouth, irritability, headaches, and the worst thing was severe sleep disruption. And he had two younger brothers and sisters. So it was parents definitely didn't need more of that. And the crazy thing throughout this entire period, not one of his doctors even hinted at the possibility that something in its diet or like a disrupted gut microbiome or nutrient deficiency could even be contributing to his symptoms.

Speaker 3:          02:18:40       Nobody even brought that up. And that's not the exception. That's the rule. Um, so, you know, his parents weren't thrilled about, uh, I mean, they weren't thrilled about medicating him, but they did it because they had no other option. And nobody suggested that it could be anything other than just, you know, something wrong with their, their son. But uh, fortunately one of his mom's friends had sent a couple of articles from my blog. One was on the gut brain axis, which we've been talking about. Another was on all of the underlying causes of behavioral disorders in kids. So they brought him to my clinic. Um, we did a whole bunch of testing as I do with all my new patients. And not surprisingly, we found he had a disrupted gut microbiome. He had cbo, bacterial overgrowth in the intestine. He had a non celiac, gluten sensitivity and gluten was in almost every food he was eating.

Speaker 3:          02:19:34       But he also had an intolerance of some other proteins like dairy and soy and corn and buckwheat, which were in the toaster waffles. He was eating every night. Yeah, deficiencies of vitamin d, b, 12 fully and iron because he was eating just flower, basically flour and sugar. And he had high levels of arsenic, which is a heavy metal because the only other beverage he would drink aside from water was rice, milk and rice. Milk has been shown to have higher levels of arsenic, so if a kid's just pounding rice milk, they could actually start to develop levels of arsenic. that could be problematic because that's crazy because a lot of people think of rice milk as a healthy beverage. Right. But, so we start, you know, we started treating him, which wasn't easy because of his ocd, like tendencies. It was really hard to get him to change his diet.

Speaker 3:          02:20:19       Um, so we just started focusing just on those mechanisms that I talked about, getting him some more nutrients and treating his god and, and dealing, You know, trying to get some of those things out of his food initially, just switching those brands of toaster waffles so that at least they were made from stuff that he wasn't clearly reacting to. And then gradually over time shifting within, within several weeks, he was having fewer tantrums. He was less set off by the things that would have done that before. About four months into the treatment, his teacher called home from school and was like, where's leo? You know, what have you done with leo? And who's this guy? Who was sending the school, it has plates because it had been horrific for her as as his teacher at school and you know, to the point where it's parents often had to come pick him up and bring them home from school because he was so disruptive.

Speaker 3:          02:21:07       Then I talked to leo's mom maybe six, seven months into the treatment. By then we had to follow up, test back. A lot of the issues that we set out to address had been resolved is dieted, expanded significantly. He was eating foods that he would have thrown against the wall just a few months before he was more tolerant, more affectionate. I'm less controlling and rigid and just better adjusted kid overall and at the end of that time his mom said something that really struck me and it's really. It's why I wrote the book. She said, why don't more doctors know about this? There's so many kids out there like leo who are suffering from these kinds of behavioral disorders, but neither their parents, northern doctors or even looking at this other stuff like the diet and the gut and all these things so it's not even a consideration and that's why I want to get this book out there because it's like we can't know and and, and treat what we're not even looking for.

Speaker 2:          02:22:02       What's crazY is what you're saying is revolutionary, but it's not.

Speaker 3:          02:22:06       Right. It's common sense, right? I mean it's food,

Speaker 2:          02:22:09       but the, you've, you essentially restructured the ecosystem of this child's body and, and brought them back to homeostasis. You brought them back to some sort of, some normal functioning. Some and this poor kid was living with a diet that

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       a giant percentage of our country is, Is consuming. A lot of kids are eating sugar cereals in the morning and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and just white bread and sugar is lunch packs with the lunchable. Although, yeah, it's even worse in kids because there's this idea that big food has been very successful. It perpetuating that. Kids need special kids foods. You know, they can't just eat what we're eating as adults. We have to prepare kids meals. You go to a restaurant and there's the kid's menu, go to a great restaurant that has meat and vegetables and all this stuff on what is the kid's menu have on it? Chicken fingers, cheese, pasta with nothing on it. Just total crap bullshit. And the idea, you know, when we go out with my daughter, they always bring us the kid's menu and my daughter's like, no, I don't need to see that.

Speaker 3:          02:23:15       I'm ordering off this menu. And it's like, yeah, we don't need breakfast cereal or pop tarts who need this craft kits just need to eat. It's even more important for kids to eat well than it is for us because their brain is still developing. Their body's still developing. So yeah, I mean someday we'll go to the doctor and you have a chronic, you know, something like this. The first questions are going to be around, what are you eating? How are you living? Oh wait, let's do some tests to find out how your gut is. Let's do some tests to see if you're nutrient deficient. Let's. Let's actually look at the causes instead of just assuming that every chronic disease is a deficiency of a medication. Yeah. That's basically how it's a problem. You have high cholesterol, you have a stat and deficiency, so we better correct that by giving you this.

Speaker 3:          02:23:59       You have high blood pressure, you have a diarrhetic deficiency. We're going to give you that. You have depression, you have an antidepressant deficiency, so we're going to give you that drug. Basically how it's looked at, that is how it's looked at. It's crazy that what you're saying is eat food, eat real food, eat food. I mean, I think if people, if we ate real food, like probably that could shave off like a couple trillion dollars from the health care and how much more effective would we be at whatever we're doing? How much healthier would people be? How much happier would people be? yeah. It's not just about health in that narrow sense of the lIke the absence of symptoms or the body. we're talking about your ability to perform at work, your ability to relate to your kids, to your partner, you know, wonder how much of the antidepressant, like the people that are prescribed are people that are experiencing depression, has to do with their diet.

Speaker 3:          02:24:52       I would say quite a high percentage. Again, I don't want to be. I think there are situational factors that cause depression. I mean, you know, for someone who is poor and lives in an economically and socially depressed area and is fighting, you know, systemic oppression, there's good reason to be depressed situation. So nevertheless a, given what we understand now about this inflammatory model of depression, it's also true that that is the very least going to exacerbate it and make it, but in some cases may be the primary driver of depression and I can't tell you how many patients I've had who've had depression that they thought was. IT was something wrong with them. There's something broken about them. you know, they just, they're not cut out for this world. They don't fit in here. That sort of thing. And then we go in, we see, oh, you've got a severe, be 12 or fully deficiency that affects your neurotransmitter levels.

Speaker 3:          02:25:47       Oh, you've got a disrupted gut microbiome. Oh you're, you've got, you know, a blood sugar abnormalities. Oh, you're hypo thyroid. We know 20 or 30 percent of patients with depression have hypo thyroid. So just correcting that could, could correct it. Can we address all Those things? All of a sudden that person's no longer depressed. And I've had people say things like, oh my god, for the last 20 years I thought something was wrong with me. I thought I was broken. I thought like I really. It was me and something was really wrong. It's a crazy word too. The problem with depression is that it's a diagnosis and that if you just said feel bad, feel bad, would not be like, oh, he's been diagnosed with feel bad, you know. But that's essential with depression is it's so blanket. It can cover a host of different neurological issues, physiological issues or behavioral issues that are there because of your environment and your life experiences.

Speaker 3:          02:26:37       Absolutely. And that was not an unintentional thing, joe, that was a drug companies creating it as a disease to that because diseases require medications to be fixed in our culture and this happens across the board and it's not, you know, you know, the story of viagara and how that was developed. It was some sort of a blood pressure medication. Correct. Right. And uh, hey, jack, jackpot. Yeah. So they found like, okay, this isn't working very well for what we designed it for, but, but it's got some pretty interesting effects and so, but they knew it wasn't enough to just then go out there and start selling it for two. Got to say, hey, here's a drug that will help you know, make you perform better, right. Bedroom. That wasn't enough. What they had to do is create a disease that it could be prescribed for because that's.

Speaker 3:          02:27:27       And then, and, and you know how they did that, they hired a, an advertising agency and the ad agency came up with the term erectile dysfunction. No way. And created this. No way. Absolutely. It's publicly available information agency named a disease. this is not the only case where this has happened, so they create this disease category and then they get it out into the world and they advertise it to people and to doctors and so all of a sudden people are going in with a magazine or like, this is me, I have erectile dysfunction, and I know now there's a drug called viagara that I need because I have erectile dysfunction and the doctor has seen the. They have their own brochure. They pull out their brochure and it says erectile dysfunction. Here are the signs and symptoms. Okay, check, check, check, check. Yes. This patient's got erectile ed. So here's a drug. Is it legal for an advertising

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       agency to name a disorder? well, I'll tell you that it's illegal in every single country in the world except for New Zealand and the United States to advertise drugs to to consumers. Please New Zealand. Be the first change. Please turn around, make us look terrible at first because this is the result. Conscious is the result of allowing drugs to be advertised is that you get advertising agencies creating conditions that then require drugs to be treated. That is fucking amazing. What else has been named by advertising agencies? Off the top of my head, I don't know, but I will. Next time I'm on this show, I'll definitely have a list for you. God damn. I can't believe that that's legal. it's legal. And you know, I, there's a, another book I read a while back, um, and the quote in the book was really revealing. It was by the ceo of merck, which is one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world.

Speaker 1:          02:29:16       And again, I'm going To paraphrase, I don't remember the exact words, but the gist of it was the real money in drugs is in selling them to healthy people. So he hit, he had realized that, you know, we basically saturated the market of medications that can be used to treat sick people. So the only way we can continue to grow and expand is to come up with ways to sell drugs to healthy people. When did they first started prescribing ended up presence? Uh, well the, the ssri is I think go back to the eighties, late eighties, early nineties, but they had other kinds of antidepressants before that called try cyclic antidepressants and other types of medications. So they've been around for awhile, but I mean, my point is like this creation of ed, erectile dysfunction as a disease was a way of kind of selling drugs to healthy people because they, they, they basically shifted them from being healthy people that otherwise wouldn't see themselves as someone who needed a drug to people who are not who, who now have a condition.

Speaker 1:          02:30:17       Yeah. From what I understand, pro vigil, that was the initial creation of provigil. They were trying to come up with a performance enhancing drug for, for um, cognitive function and they couldn't just sell it as such, so they had to come up with some sort of a reason why people need it. So they went with narcolepsy. Right. And then you, I mean, you have people who have been arguing that stat and should be put in the water supply. Why? Yeah. There literally blew the fuck. Says that as a doctor in the uk, that guy's a monster who lit not cause eating a salad right now. Fucking monster put it in the water supply. Qmap is up. That's poison. He's seriously. I advocated for that and it wasn't a joke. It wasn't an exaggeration. This is a few years back. I can't. I can't. I have a blog article about it because his argument was these, you know, these drugs are so effective for reducing the risk of heart disease that we should just be giving them to everybody despite whether they

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       want to take them or not because it doesn't that don't they seriously disrupt performance. Physical performance. The bigger question is whether statens actually extend lifespan in people without preexisting heart disease and a lot of the research suggests that not that the answer to that question is no or very in a, in an almost non insignificant way and then you have to balance that with the potential side effects. Like the increased risk of diabetes, particularly in women with and now we have 100 million people with diabetes and then the muscle fatigue and myopathy and that, that sort of thing. But uh, yeah, I mean I think this is, I mean we go off on this when we are talking about misaligned incentives and all of these things we've been talking about are just examples of how what's in the best interests of a drug company de is not necessarily in the best interest of us as patients or as for dr.

Speaker 3:          02:32:12       When he goes back to what you were saying about teeth, tooth decay and fluoride in the water, right? Like how much tooth decay is really because of our diet. And it's not because of fluoride is not because Florida is not good for you. Well you look especially in large quantities and you can get away with it in some of the quantities. It's in our water supply. But from what I understand, it's not really. We don't need it. So, I know this might sound controversial, but do we think that our 100 gatherer ancestors were brushing their teeth twice a day and flossing twice a day now? They probably had horrible breath. Well, here'S the thing, um, there is an oral microbiome just like there is a microbiome in the gut and it's what's likely and, and they've archeologists have know that when they, you know, when they uncover remains from the traditional, you know, our ancestors, our paleolithic ancestors, they have great healthy jaws and teeth and not egyptians.

Speaker 3:          02:33:11       You know, about that. Well, that was civilization already. Yeah. Grinding food, talking about further back, further back in our history prior to agriculture right now, none of that. And so what that suggests is that, you know, look, I brushed my teeth and floss and not suggesting that people shouldn't now and that there hasn't been some improvement, but that, you know, the fact that weston price went around to all these traditional cultures and found that they had beautiful healthy teeth and wide dental arches. They weren't brushing their teeth twice a day and flossing twice a day, but they had root underlying foundation of health and a healthy microbiome, not only in their gut but in oral microbiome that lead to healthy teeth. Even without that kind of dental hygiene and dental care. And uh, you know, there are now oral probiotics, dental probiotics, which are chewable tablets that you can just, you know, you pop one in your mouth after you brush your teeth, you chew. And I've had patients who had been having recurring cavities, dental issues, period per

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       periodontal periodontal issues that just by chewing one of these dental probiotics twice a day, I've had like a complete reversal on their dental health where, you know, they go from having like a cavity every time they go to the dentist to having no cavities at all

Speaker 2:          02:34:32       because that was, that's one of those woo subjects where people go, oh, you fucking crystal hippie. You know, when you start talking about fluoride in the water. But do we really. I mean, we definitely need to somehow or another clean the water of bacteria and treat the water so that it doesn't have pollutants in it, but that can be done with filtration systems. You know, people in the wild, not in the wild, meAning like the toumani, but people that live in camps for months at a time, like friends of mine, they go on these back country trips. They use water filters to use. They'll take a walk, they'll take like a wallow that like an elk have been stomping around and muddy water and they'll put this water through this filtration system and make it so you can drink it and there's stary pens. They have these pens that you could spin the pan around the water for a predetermined period of time and it kills everything. That's bacteria. All the bacteria in the water. There's a bunch of different filtration systems, pumps that they use on creeks to keep beaver fever. What's that stuff called? Giardia. Giardia from beaver. Shit in the water. So this all can be done without chemicals. that was my point. Yeah, so the chemicals that we have in the water there, they might be terrible for you. They're not necessary and especially in terms of flUoride, it might be completely misguided.

Speaker 1:          02:35:53       Have you read, I forget the book on this big thick book on fluoride. Bryson, I think this is the last name of the author. It's a yellow cover. no, I haven't read it. I think he mentioned something about how in this this comes up in other contexts too, um, where, uh, companies that have something that's toxic that they would otherwise have to pay for to dispose of. I have figured out ways to actually sell that stuff to the food industry or to another industry that, that then puts it in some products. So industrial seed oils like soybean oil, cottonseed oil, those kinds of things. Originally were, were not considered foods. They were waste products from ag agriculture from text growing those crops. And then the, the brilliance of those that have those companies at that time was figuring out a way to turn those things that would have otherwise been seen as waste into like a food product that they could then sell.

Speaker 1:          02:36:50       And make money off of really those, those, those are amongst the worst because you know, those are ubiquitous in the american diet, like if you pick up any package food, you're going to see, you know, soybean oil, corn oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, et cetera. There's all these highly processed and refined omega six vegetable oils. And those vegetable oils are very difficult for your body to process well there. First of all, they're almost completely devoid of nutrients. They have, you know, some of them have vitamin e, but they have almost no other nutrients at all. Um, and historically humans had consumed a balance of omega six and omega three oils that was somewhere between, you know, one to one ratio or maybe a four to one in favor of omega six. But, uh, the amount of omega six oils that we consume today is much higher, you know, sometimes like a 20 to one ratio of omega six to omega three.

Speaker 1:          02:37:43       And this is a controversial topic. There was just a research study published that was a, seemed to suggest that these oils actually may not be as harmful as as we thought they were, but I haven't had a chance to read the full text of the study yet. And you have to look at the overall weight of the evidence, you know, if you've got 40 studies showing that there are harmful and then one that shows that they're not well. Okay, but you got to consider that in the whole context. Yeah. Yeah. And you got to find out who funded that study and there are a lot of questions to ask and whether even the studies said what, what people say it said, which is often not the case when you look into it. That fluoride one's really freaking me out now that we're talking about it because I wonder like, how do you, how would you ever stop that? What's the.

Speaker 2:          02:38:28       Hasn't there been connections or correlations between fluoride and low iq?

Speaker 1:          02:38:35       That sounds familiar, but again, it's not topic I've looked into in detail. So I don't want to say something that's not correct, but um, that's the difference in you and me.

Speaker 2:          02:38:47       I think I heard fluoride exposure in utero linked to your iq in bed study says, can you go scroll up a little bit there, jamie? Let me. They'll. Yeah. Increased levels of prenatal fluoride exposure may be associated with lower cognitive function in children. New study says published tuesday and the journal of environmental health perspectives evaluated nearly 300 sets of mothers and children in Mexico and tested children twice for cognitive development over the course of 12 years. Florida is not added to public water supplies in Mexico, but people are exposed to it through naturally occurring fluoride in water and fluoridated salt and supplements. Wow.

Speaker 1:          02:39:25       yeah. And the, I mean this highlight something else that we haven't talked about much at all in terms of aspect of the modern environment. It's problematic, which is toxins being one of them, but also things like mercury, bisphenol a, bpa which is in the plastic water bottles, seats, and what's this? Thousands of us locales. We're lit. We're lead poisoning is worse than. yeah. Yeah. Did you see that new study on India? I think it was new delhi, I forget what, but air pollution in India

Speaker 2:          02:39:58       at an all time high and they show these photographs of this city and

Speaker 1:          02:40:01       it is insane. You just can't see anything. I can't see anything. You can't see a building 100 yards ahead of you. Yeah. So I mean air pollution has been linked to obesity and cardiovascular disease and stuff. You wouldn't even think, not just respiratory,

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       you know, things like systemic inflammatory conditions. And the problem with toxins is our initial understanding of toxic toxicity was only like acute toxicity. Like what happens if you get so much mercury in your body so quickly that it causes like an acute problem and we assume that um, you know, if, if you don't see acute toxicity then there's no problem. Like There's nothing in between acute toxicity and just normal that we know now that like there was a really interesting study a couple years back. I wrote about this on my blog. I think the title was something like mercury, a fish consumption and kids.

Speaker 1:          02:40:52       Look at this video. The video came out today, this is a really bad, uh, air pollution caused car accident pile up in new delhi that these people are trying to get people out of the car and just a couple of seconds it's just like a snow storm here in America and other cars and it comes slamming into them. Oh, they're going to tell them to hurry up and get the fuck out of there before another one comes in. It happens like three or four times in a row right here.

Speaker 3:          02:41:15       Oh my god.

Speaker 1:          02:41:17       So these. So these people are standing there and see, oh my god, mrs. On a freeway. Oh my gosh. Oh my god. Now they gotta get the fuck out because another one's coming. It's insane. Oh my god. This is all just air pollution there. Oh my god. This is incredible. This is like, they're in a fog on a mountain road and were on the highway. this is what is the name of this video? So you can watch on twitter. I define on twitter litter going around the dassault right before the show starts. That's why I was like, oh my god. New delhi car accident, uh, air pollution. Oh my god, this is insane. And they're telling these people get out of the car.

Speaker 3:          02:42:03       what do you do? Because if you go up to try to warn people it's they can't see you there either.

Speaker 1:          02:42:09       Yeah. And then what if someone takes a turn and it hits those people to the side? Oh god, this is horrific. That's about where it ends right here. Oh my god.

Speaker 3:          02:42:17       Yeah. So I mean, these are like the mercury thing, you know, the idea for a long time was, oh, if your blood levels below 10 parts per million, you're fine. There's no evidence, you know, there's no, there's no issue. So this new study came out and they looked at kids and they looked at cortisol levels, which and in and inflammatory inflammatory markers and they found that kids that, that had mercury levels that were even as, as low as a one, so you know, almost 10 times lower than the level of concern had higher levels of cortisol and higher levels of inflammatory markers and they and they. So that totally turned things on the, on, on their head. It was like all of a sudden, you know, lower levels of the talks of these toxins than we thought were problematic are actually problematic and they, when they dove in and look deeper, they found a, you know, some of the kids who were affected had certain genetic polymorphisms, like there was something that made them more susceptible or maybe they had nutrient deficiencies that made them less able to detoxify the mercury as they normally should be able to.

Speaker 3:          02:43:24       And you know, what further complicates it is that, uh, the symptoms that you see with high levels of toxin can actually be different at low levels. So let's say researchers design a study to see the toxic effects of mercury when, when the exposure is severe and they're looking for certain studies and then they start lowering the dose of mercury to see when those effects go away, they will completely miss the effects that are caused by the low doses of mercury because they're are different than the effects that they were studying at the higher doses. So this caused a problem for years where it was assumed that the low doses were harmless because they weren't observing the same effects they saw at the high doses and now they know this and so they've redesigned studies to look, just cast a wider net and see what's happening.

Speaker 3:          02:44:12       And sure enough at those lower levels of toxins they're seeing all kinds of effects that are actually in some cases, opposite of the effect that you see with the high dose of the toxin. Have you adjusted like where you live or anything because of all this? Uh, well I, you know, when we're, we just bought a house a couple of years ago and we just um, you know, we had a choice of where to live. We wanted to live in berkeley. That's where my offices. And so we ended up living up on, on top of the hill and that was somewhat intentional for me. It's right near tilden park, which is a outdoor regional park space with a lot of green area and stuff. And, and there are parts of berkeley that, you know, where the air quality is really, really bad. Like surprising if you don't, if you don't know that area, if you go online to some of these air quality ratings sites, you can see that parts of berkeley or like c minus or d, um, because there's so much industry there and the chevron plan and stuff, but this is where it gets really, you know, the inequalities is brutal because guess who ends up often living in the areas that are most toxic are the people who are economically disadvantaged and they're the least influential when it comes to any kind of political power to, to change, make changes in those areas.

Speaker 3:          02:45:25       So it's unfair. It's, it's, and they're disproportionately affected by that because they, nobody's watching out for them. Yeah. Well there's, there's a lot of it, a lot of

Speaker 2:          02:45:35       factors we could talk about, but I think, uh, uh, it's just, it's so important that there's people like you out there that are highlighting these things, are writing books about these things and talking about these things on podcast. So thank you so much, man. Thank you for your book and thank you for that. Pleasure. Last time you were here, we learned so much too, so tell people one more time the name of the book where to get it. Yeah, it's unconventional medicine. You can get it on amazon and also a unconventional medicine book.com. You can actually download the first three chapters for free. Do it. Get on it, change your health folks. Get your shit together. Thank you chris. Really appreciate it. Always. Great to see you too, man. Thank you.
