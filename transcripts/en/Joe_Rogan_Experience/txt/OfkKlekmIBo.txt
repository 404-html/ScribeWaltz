Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Recording the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by fleshlight. You could have drove up in.net and click on the link for the flashlight. You can enter in the name Rogan and get 15 percent off and number one sex toy from that. And then you could shoot loads in there at a discount. Georgia, I'm going to give you one before you leave. Take it, throw it in the garbage. Do whatever you like, sir. It is yours. Georgia is in the house from ancient aliens. Eddie Bravo isn't the house red bands in the house.

Speaker 2:          00:00:32       Pitches is ready to throw the fuck down.

Speaker 1:          00:00:40       This is the magic of twitter. Ladies and gentlemen, and the Internet. Just something happened. I don't remember where we were tweeting about, but all of a sudden Georgia tweeted me back and I tweet him and I say, you want to do my podcast and says fuck Ya. And boom. And then we meet in Vegas and we're hanging out in vegas like we'd known each other forever. Fucking time. Thank you dude. There was a lot of fucking fun man. Georgia was a cool cat. And uh, I mean, one of my favorite shows of all time, I love that ancient aliens. I've got a big stack of them, like don't necessarily agree with everything, but I don't think you do either. I think it's a lot of, who knows, right? Absolutely. So a lot of. I mean that's what I got from you talking to you in Vegas.

Speaker 1:          00:01:21       I was like, man, maybe that's crazy. Maybe it's going to Atlanta, this was a spaceship. But if you don't know what I mean, but you were like really open to any possibility which I truly admire in a person. You know? So many people are married to their fucking ideas, even preposterous ideas. Like, you know, the, David, I really fucking believes that there's reptilians that are running this planet, you know, like in, and he says he's got facts and information. Motherfucker. Have you seen a reptilian? If you haven't, how can you be sure? How can you be when you hear stuff like that? Now you're in the business of, of this wild, crazy. You have a world where so many people look down on anything that's even remotely outside of the mainstream of it gets ridiculed, but when you see a guy like David, right, do you ever say, I wonder if this motherfucker works for the government puts says so much and so much shit.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       That makes sense, and then he starts talking about reptilians and he got to go, well that's classic disinformation. That's like the move that's like, you know, if you want to a piss in the well we could do is just throw a bunch of shit in there that really makes sense. Like the CIA killed JFK and we were in Vietnam for money and the military industrial complex. It really does run things just like Eisenhower said. Plus there's a pace on the moon. We've been donating their telepathically for years and what we do is we. We have a place where we go, well, we teleport people and you have to be naked and that's why women aren't allowed to be on the base. I know. What the fuck are you talking about, man? And Bright, thrilling, all that wacky shit in there. You're kind of piss on all the stuff that is interesting because you know, you could say, well, wait a minute, this guy said that the CIA killed Kennedy, but then he also talked about the Wacky Shit on the moon, right?

Speaker 1:          00:03:07       Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, to me it's very resistant when you go with your gut feeling because our people out there really at the same time, some of this book that you would say also carry some math so you know, that's a problem. Know at the end of the day you just have to let it go and be like, that's what those people are not gonna know anything. Whenever you have a choice because in the end we all make a choice what we believe in, what we subscribe to and you know, some of that stuff is crazy. Guess what I mean? If you look at the science today, science book, you know there are all these different theories and ideas and it's pretty much cutting edge on the cutting edge of knowledge. But if you look in a textbook from 200 years ago, which was published by the university, that was considered cutting edge of knowledge at the time.

Speaker 1:          00:04:13       Now you're looking at that textbook today, 200 years later and 99 percent of acknowledging obsolete. Is that true? Like what has been disproven? Like what field has been completely reworked over the last 200 years to their stuff as stuff gets updated and how much of it is absolutely. It all comes down to an edison were certain procedures that time considered to be perfect like radiation treatment that were actually run from the station on the monitor comes down said about David. I have to ask John. I can totally make. He was a shell. It was on youtube, on a Michelle, and now they're friends and they're going to be gone each other to hang out with Alex at one weekend in Vegas because you're a big Alex Jones Fan. Listen brother, I love Alex too. I love Alex to. Come on. Let's hang out with the dude and then you get a better sense of what else counts.

Speaker 1:          00:05:26       Stones is Alex Jones, 24 slash seven, whether it's a fucking conspiracy to keep him from getting a cigarette. She tried to keep it from that. Beer was this woman who works at the bar. He sees me, he avoids me, avoids contact management. Keep me from having a parent who's about the tickets. Remember the tick everything. Anything. I was worried that we weren't really going to get in the UFC tickets. My brother, you're good. You're my friend. We're cool. Keith, he's a great guy. He's a great guy, but he's crazy, you know, and you to be crazy to dig for the truth that much. And I look, I say, but Alex, he's right about a lot. Shit, I don't know what the percentage is. I always throw out a number like he's right about 70 percent, but the 30 percent flexing that he just, you know, kind of fills in the blanks.

Speaker 1:          00:06:10       There's a lot of filling in the blanks, but the 70 percent that he's, or whatever number it is that he is right. It's worth it. It's shocking. And he's a perfect example of what you were talking about before, like where you have to Kinda like use her own filter. There's a lot of stuff that he says that has an incredible amount of merit. It's absolutely correct. And this stuff that says you're just going, what the fuck are you talking about? He gets crazy. He doesn't go reptilian crazy, but he gets deep in new world order. He gets a like, like eugenics crazy. He gets like he's sure they have a population decreased plan where they're going to kill off. Most people except for 500,000 elites were going to be able to live forever. And like, man, you got to have some fucking rock solid evidence to throw that one around.

Speaker 1:          00:06:52       You can't just toss that out like a beach ball that the elites are gonna. Kill out fucking have a population except $500,000. Maybe be someone's thought that up. I'm not saying it's outside of the realm of possibility. Your business though is filled with that. They mean, look, there are hundreds of billions of stars in this galaxy and we have already spotted so many of them over the last couple of decades or a couple of years rather, that are in the goldilocks zone where they know kid possibly inhabit life. They sprouted visit. I don't know what the number are, orbiting increases all the time. They're constantly finding planets that could possibly support. Right. And planets that are older than ours by a billion years plus or. Absolutely. In. The fascinating thing is that, you know, when the sixties and seventies, when Erich von Daniken first wrote, chariots of the Gods, you know, the general consensus in the sixties and seventies was that this discussion was even more taboo than it is today obviously.

Speaker 1:          00:07:49       But back then, you know, it was like, you know, maybe we were alone in the universe and there was only a handful like Frank Drake and the Carl Sagan who proposed the idea or dabbled with the idea that, you know, we might not be the only ones in the mainstream. Legitimate. Exactly. I'm a community now today. You, you'd be hard pressed to find any scientist or any astronomer or astrophysicist that will tell you that they think we're alone in the universe. So we've definitely switched where it's almost a given now that, uh, everyone thinks that, you know, they're intelligent life exists in the universe. However, the big taboo topic that we have today that still remains is okay, they'll say there is life in the universe, in the galaxy, but there is no way that that intelligent life could have ever been here or visited birth in the remote past or even present day. And that to me is a fallacy in logic because granted the distances between the stars are indeed huge too mind boggling.

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       But just because we can't get from point a to point b doesn't mean another society that like you mentioned where you sit or inferred that there are bullying years older than us on third world at least as a billion years old. Well, I mean we are a very, very young culture by any means of the imagination. So someone that's only 100,000 years older, I mean they have technologies or other type of. Something where they combine biology with technology and things like that that we couldn't even dream up right now. Our imagination is the only thing that limits us from seeing what they could possibly have given them a thousand years in advance of us in a million years or even a few hundred years. Man, look what Nikola Tesla was doing in the early 20th century and, and, and look at what's going on today. I mean, that's a gigantic monumental leap and just a little over 100 years. That's amazing. Well, I mean, just imagine showing your great grandpa one of our phones today. Yeah. I mean to, to him and star Trek couldn't fuck with that. Right, exactly. They thought you were going to be able to beam people onto a planet, but they still had walkie talkies cookout. You know, he fucking, he didn't think. Couldn't wrap

Speaker 1:          00:10:16       their head around the idea that you would have real time communication on that states. I convene people there, but you can't have, you know, you can just talk into it. The voice thing. Depressed the voice thing. Go Eddie Bravo, bravo comes wikipedia page videos. That's fucking amazing and it's even with three, 14 years fast as fuck, man, any alien species that's a thousand years from last night, we're going to know what they can do is absolutely silly. We already understand principles of folding space time and meeting those two points and having a gateway to something they know that the possibility that's existing in the unit, completely theoretical, but so many things were theoretical just a couple of hundred years ago and look what they're doing right now with with this higgs Boson collider in that the move on plasma, but part of freedom, one sugar camp is 40 or $440. Billion tons I think. Which one? Either one fucking great sugar cube, you know, and the fact that they're gonna come up,

Speaker 3:          00:11:24       they're, they're, they're hinting that they're really close to discovering the God particle. This is Boston us today in 2011 something a thousand years from now. My thought is always though that why would we even see it? They could come as clouds. You don't think they're gonna be able to disguise themselves as a fucking tree or just not. Not Be visible at a around us right now and that is the same allegory and sometimes uses if you have some patio lighting out on your patio and you have a cat and that cat loves to go outside in the patio every night and you look up to the sky or look up to the patio lights, sees the lights and the cat might think, yeah, this is very pretty. It's beautiful, but that cat has no concept of what goes into those patio lights, that there's electricity, plastic wiring, all these different things.

Speaker 3:          00:12:12       But so, which means that, that is exactly the concept of exit terrestrials as well, that they can conceivably show up as some type of shape shifters or something and not just into people but into objects or something because they would use exactly the same what we use today. And that's technology, but there's something involved where, you know, just because we can't figure it out doesn't mean it does not exist. I always say I always bring up what I call the art theory when it comes to, uh, to aliens. And my theory is that the idea is that if you couldn't smell, if you didn't have a sense of smell, you would have no idea that farts existed. You had no idea that you were just sitting in someone's asked gas, right? You would have no, no clue, but because you have a sense of smell, this invisible thing all of a sudden becomes a reality.

Speaker 3:          00:13:06       How do we not know there are a million different senses, a million different things that are around us all the time that we just can't tune into an all some alien has to do is tune into something that's outside of our spectrum to it, into something that's not within our natural ability to perceive. I mean our natural ability perceive as very similar to the people that live 10,000 years ago and we're throwing fucking pointed sticks it, moving animals. This is a very, very little difference between us genetically now and then. So how do we not know that the systems that we have in place are all in place for the natural world, all in place for you. You hear animals, you know you, you see moving things you know and you smelled food. You know these are all in place to keep us alive and keep us successful.

Speaker 3:          00:13:51       We could very well be developing new senses because of Wifi and because of all these cellular signals and the way human beings. How sick are you right now, buddy? You want to go home or you that sick? They want to go home. I don't want you to get everybody else cold. Perfect example. It's fucking some shit flying through the air in this room right now. That's this guy's sick and he's got some germs inside of his body. There's some shit that you can't see unless you get a microscope and they're little invading animals. They're trying to take over and kill him. So his army right now is at war. There's so much shit out there. There's so much shit out there that we can't wrap our heads around because it's happening right here at this table right now. There's aliens watching us in the fridge.

Speaker 3:          00:14:32       You get into your field and how did you get on ancient aliens? Well, for that, I really have to thank my, my grandma because growing up I, I traveled around the world with my, with my parents and they made sure that we would go to those different museums and archeological sites and things like that. Then, you know, have like guided tours by the resident archeologists or the resident curator and stuff like that. Um, but then whenever I would come back home, my grandma would say, all right, so you've just been taught about the contemporary contemporary ideas of particular cultures, but let me show you that other ideas and theories exist as well. So she would tell me about that. Lantus, she would tell me about, you know, the ancient astronauts theory and chariots of the gods and all those different viewpoints that have been proposed by others.

Speaker 3:          00:15:29       So for me, these types of topics have been. I've been exposed to those fairly, at a fairly young age. I mean this was all dinner table conversation. Um, especially, you know, when my parents or my grandparents would visit a. But at the same time, my mom, she always used to say that whenever we would have to use this discussion, she would say, you know, I really think that all of this that we have today, it's been here before. And I never knew what she meant. And of course, you know, I was five, six, seven years old, but today I knew exactly. And I finally understand what she meant that, you know, this is just a repetition of history. How high was she when she started this? Hey, I was, I was too young. So I'm sure they're talking about civilization. I don't think so. Not My mom.

Speaker 3:          00:16:22       No, she is, she's lovely. And all of them that right now. And um, you know, so, so the, the question, you know, so today especially, you know, now that my parents were like, you know, for, for a long time, they with that guy, you're wasting your time with this, Yada Yada. And uh, now all I have to say is that, you know, I am here because of my parents and my grandparents. And so it's, it's, it was their fault that all this happened. What year did chariots of the gods came out? It came out like in the sixties. Yeah, it was first published in German under the title memories of the future in 1968 and then it was a runaway success and the first English edition came out in 1970 and within a, you know, eight months or so, 6 million copies have been sold. I mean it was an absolute phenomenon that they called the keitus and he was a huge success worldwide and here we are in 2011 in chariots of the Gods is still read Eric Fund.

Speaker 3:          00:17:23       Danny can just turned 77 years old by the way. He says hello to the entire audience. He's very happy and excited that I'm under program. So he says yes, absolutely listening. So we're trying. We're trying to get him on the program to bring them in. We'll do it. Remote sensing. Where does he live? He lives in Switzerland. I'll fucking fly out to switch. All right, well we'll definitely set something up. I love it when you first met him. It's that kind of crazy. Really. I would say it was weird the first time we actually hung out and had a conversation and stuff because I had, you know, I had gone to some of his lectures when I was in my early teens. So you know, and you know, it's different than someone named forever. Yeah. No, I mean, look, I started the magazine that are published.

Speaker 3:          00:18:12       You published legendary 1998. That's when we started in 1998 and in legendary times is basically all about ancient civilizations. Yes. And it's specifically geared towards ancient civilizations in respect to the ancient astronaut theory suggesting or exploring the idea whether or not extra terrestrials flesh and blood exits. Terrestrials visited earth in the remote past. And by that I don't mean you know, a hundred years ago, but we're talking five, six, seven, 8,000 years ago from today. When you look at it, when you look at the Sumerian texts and you look at funding Akins work and what is your gut impression? Would you an thank you if got not making a conclusion. Which way do you lean? Do you mean 50 percent that they were. They were here 50 percent than maybe something else happened. Like what? How do you? More than 50 percent personally? Yes. One hundred percent. Absolutely. It gives you the most hope or the most a reason to believe this.

Speaker 3:          00:19:13       Well, because it's I, I sometimes liken it to when you're completing a puzzle, it doesn't matter how big the puzzle is, but the more pieces you put together, the more pieces you fit into place, even when that puzzle is not yet completed. And we've all done puzzles as kids, it gets easier as you move along, but you can stop somewhere three quarters of the way and you can look at that puzzle and you know exactly what the picture looks like even though it's not yet complete. And there's a couple of pieces missing. So that is what the ancient astronauts theory to me is like that there are so many indications from our ancient cultures that the conclusion, in my opinion is inescapable. And I'm not just saying this, you know, because I'm pulling this out of my ass, but because there are stories and there are physical pieces of evidence that the only conclusion that we can draw unless we go into the realm of the fantastical and the unlikely is that we have been visited by flesh and blood exits the restaurant.

Speaker 3:          00:20:26       What is the, what is like, if you were going to try to convince somebody, what is the most compelling evidence in your opinion that, you know, you said there's, there's evidence where you cannot draw any other conclusions. What is the most compelling? Well, you know, and this is where I truly enjoy and respect the work of many archaeologists around the world because they excavating a different, uh, sites and different monuments and they're truly breaking their backs for some fantastic research. However, sometimes when you look at that research or some of the ideas that they present, um, there are some faults in, in, in logic there because they, for example, suggests that we have moved a block that's 1,500 tons heavy, 1,500 metric tons heavy with a piece of string and some chicken bones. And today our cranes, they tap out at 1,350 tons. So if we today, how much difference is that weight was. Oh, that's, we're talking about 200 and 200 tons. So 200 tons shy. Yeah, we can do to. Right, right, exactly. It's heavier. So using that as the best proof. Well, I mean there's multiple. I mean that, that one block for example, is it the city in Lebanon called bow back? I've seen, we've all seen that amazing stone that's in charge of the God the movie. Exactly, yes. Heliopolis,

Speaker 4:          00:21:58       you've seen it already right beyond you, you, you, you can't even wrap your head around it. He was like, this is not, you can't move this, move this. So you have photos of that. Was it maybe just something that we're not thinking of like, like it was, you know, underwater at one point it made it easier to move rocks or anything like that or this, it doesn't make it easier to move something to epic. What would the, the, the possibilities are? There's two in my opinion, there's his idea that we've been visited by ancient aliens and then there's the, the idea that civilization has been restarted several times and that is that there's some sort of a cataclysmic event that's killed almost everybody except for a small amount of stragglers and they regrouped and rebuilt and rethought things out. And that's one of the reasons why things come so quickly and technology is moving so fast and as your mom said, or whose grandmother, whoever it was, that we are relearning. We've done this before.

Speaker 3:          00:22:51       And, and it can also be a combination of both. You see that? That's the thing that uh, there are. Can I see that picture? Of course. This is the one. This is the, this is Baalbek. Yes. There's the bow back. It's called the stone of the pregnant woman and it's one of the biggest monoliths that has ever been seen on planet earth. And uh, you know, to me right there, we could not move this with our modern day cranes. And so, you know, something happened in all of the ancient sites because you know, we know there's absolutely no question in my mind that our ancestors, I mean they were extremely smart. They were ingenious and obviously did they know how to cut stones and how to transport them and things like that. However, there, and I'm not really interested in moving around stones that are cut from limestone or sandstone and things like this.

Speaker 3:          00:23:48       But what I'm interested in is stuff like this where it was cut out of granted or out of diorite. We're still today. We use diamond tip saws in order to cut any of these blocks that we cut today and allegedly our ancestors that this with copper tools. And I'm sorry, somewhere the logic just fails because there's logic certainly fails that, that technology that we attributed to those people because we have to put them in the bronze age. And the copper age, we can't put them in the age of steel, but to me the logic is much more likely that they we were wrong about the age of bronze and steel and that people had to figure it out. Diverse hip tools like went there, didn't they find markings inside the sarcophagus and the king's chamber of the Great Pyramid of Giza? Yes. That they believe were attributed only to diamond. Head of drill.

Speaker 3:          00:24:41       Absolutely. And in Egypt we have a very fascinating site called Abi Dose and in Abi Dose you have a sorry, in Aba Zeer, not in Dose Abbott doses where they have to do those weird hieroglyphics, but in Ab Azir you have a what's known as a signatures of core drills, and a core drill is basically if you imagine a steel tube tip with diamonds that drills itself into the ground or into the Rock, and then you break it free. You take out that tube and inside of it you have like a pipe of that, a cordial sample of that particular rock. Now in Abu Azir, we find multiple stones where we can see a signature of these types of machining that took place there. Now a lot of people have said, oh, well, these are all modern day occurrences. And uh, it was done. You know, when the first first a modern day core drill machine was invented in 19, early 19 twenties.

Speaker 3:          00:25:43       Now when you look at the book that Surf Flinders Petrie wrote, that book was written in Nineteen Oh six. And it already had drawings of those core drill holes in them, which proves that these core drill holes that we can find acquisitions are not modern day creations. And that is absolutely crazy because Christopher done, one of my colleagues who wrote the Giza power plant, he proved because he's a machinist, I mean he's an engineer and he knows this stuff like the back of his hand. So it's not like somebody walked along and said, this is how it is. But this guy, that's what he does for a living. He builds machines and he, uh, you know, precision mechanisms and things like this. So he is trained for that kind of a, you know, investigation and uh, he said that there is no way that this could have been done with, uh, with copper tools.

Speaker 3:          00:26:42       I mean, it's just. And so, you know, there's some, just wild, wild pieces of evidence that we have out there like in Puma Puma, for example, highly in the Bolivian highlands at an altitude of 12 and a half thousand feet. There is this magnificent place called to an ACO that everyday hundreds of tourists arrive there and they look at it, it take pictures and then they leave as clueless as they arrived. And, um, uh, about 150 200 yards away from, from, to knock who there's another site that's very much lesser known, called Puma Puma. Cool. And at Puma Puma, everything defies logic is defied at Puma. Puma will be caused the blocks of stone that we have. There are pure diorite, andesite and granted and uh, they are so perfect that we today would have a hard time recreating some of these blocks. And I actually spoke to a real life stonemasons.

Speaker 3:          00:27:47       His name is Roger Hopkins. And he looked at some of these pictures that I showed him of Puma Puma crew, and he said that not for any amount of money or for any amount of time would volunteer to try to replicate some of these rocks as somebody blocks. And if a real life stone mason says this, I mean God bless the, um, the professors and the archeologists, but I'd rather listen to someone who cut stone for a living than someone you know who stands before a blackboard. But this guy who cut stone for a living, what he said was that it could be done. You said it would be really hard and he wouldn't want to do it for any amount of money, but that it couldn't be done. Yes. But I wouldn't lead with, with modern day. Yes. And not with what? So with chicken bones, if we know that if we know that it could be done with modern technology, wouldn't it be more likely that modern technology is sort of a recreation of what people did learn in the past and that they probably were wiped out by some sort of a cataclysmic disaster.

Speaker 3:          00:28:50       That to me, seems way more likely than aliens came and moved rocks. No, you're saying if like if Pete, if it'd be really, really difficult for people to do it today. Well, there's a lot of stuff that will be incredibly difficult for people to do it today. I'm not necessarily suggesting suggesting that aliens moved to rocks. What I'm saying is that the aliens that visited Earth gave the technology or taught the technology to humans because what they wanted to do is to leave behind messages that they were here in the past. So all those incredible monuments that we have today, like the Pyramids of Giza or Stonehenge or Puma Puma for example, or new grange. All these magnificent sights in Cusco, Machu Picchu in Peru, that all those places are messages for a future generation to understand that something way different happened in our past. That is the main reason why, for example, we have religions today and things like this.

Speaker 3:          00:29:54       So. So you think that pretty much all science emanates from some sort of an alien contact? Is that what you think? Uh, no because modern day, because you know, because was a trace of modernist science so you can follow it. Exactly right. Now let's think about this. What, what age do you think people had technology that sort of any fucking nut that crashed and the, you know, the TV show lost crash on an island and you could recreate, what was that like maybe 2000, 3000 years ago, no more thousand dollars, something like that. So like five, 6,000 years ago they were basically living like savages, right? Supposedly. Suppose serially supposedly yes. If you follow, let's give him even even even early. I mean, look, the thing is my point, I'm sorry, I just, my point was that if in 10,000 years time people have gone from being cave dwelling savages that were throwing pointy sticks, it, moving animals to people with cell phones and the Internet and wireless and this is all created pain arguably by human beings.

Speaker 3:          00:30:59       There's a record of all these inventions and all these creations. If this has been achieved over 10,000 years, what's to say that there wasn't some sort of a massive disaster that happened at the end of the last ice age or younger in in their 20,000 years ago, but the date it for 15,000, whatever the fuck it is, and that technology died and that civilization died and it had to be reinvented by the surviving humans basically from scratch and that even though human beings have been around for a long, long, long time before that and civilization had evolved to an incredibly high level, all that information was lost. That to me is way more likely than aliens. Well, but see, here's the thing. This is where the difference lies that when let's say the Sumerian culture sprung out of virtually nothing happened virtually overnight. The Sumerians were very clear in stating that they got their start in civilization by what they referred to as the under knocking and the unlock key translated into English means those who from the hurricane.

Speaker 3:          00:32:05       Yes, exactly, but isn't that true that that's only by. That means Zechariah stitching is pretty much the main scholar of the Sumerian texts that police. There's a lot of other scholars that do not agree with it. Absolutely. But the translation, even a, a, a quote unquote mainstream scientist or some neurologist will say that on knocking means that I mean that, that is not, for example, the sicker, right. He did have quite a few things that he translated, you know, quote unquote himself. Uh, so that's definitely a valid point. But there are the great majority of what he's

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       talking about has been translated correctly and he has used, you know, many of the most accessible, uh, and correct translations that can be found today. But even in the epic of Gilgamesh, don't they refer to a long gone superior civilization that existed before then? Yes. But that, but that civilization always lived, quote unquote somewhere else and integrate dark void. Now what's the great dark avoid? That's a beautiful Pasadena city name. It's a poetic way of saying compton deep space. Compton would've been better for him. Shit fucked up. Yeah, maybe. Maybe it is, but you know, you follow me. What I'm saying is that like, you know, I firmly believe that there's life out there. I mean, I think the possibility is, you know, there's the numbers, you know, and I think it's also very possible that it's reached us, but I think if you look at what's more likely, if we absolutely know that people can build a immense structures, if we absolutely know that civilization, uh, most likely because of all these historical, you know, depictions of natural disasters, whether it's the epic of Gilgamesh or Noah's Ark, or 100 different cultures that have stores of apocalyptic disastrous and the volatile nature of the earth itself.

Speaker 4:          00:34:06       The fact that we know it's covered in craters, the fact that we know that every plan and we look at the moon and just see creators all over the place. We know about the shifting of the polar ice caps, who know about Pangea. We know that there was intelligent life probably in some sort of a monkey forum when Pangea was around, right? Yes. No, absolutely. But a beating for people don't know the whole entire world is one continent that's a fieriness drifted apart. I think that, I mean, I just think that if we know for a fact that human beings are capable now of doing spectacular things, and we have said already that if we existed 100 years more man, and imagine what we would know. Just imagine what has sprung out over the last hundred, 300 years. You know, and I think you add a few hundred years for that or a thousand years to that.

Speaker 4:          00:34:48       It's not unreasonable in my opinion, to think that 10,000 years ago there was some sort of an event, some sort of catastrophic. Maybe it's $15,000, whatever the fuck name it, a catastrophic event that fuck this world sideways and killed almost everybody. To me that is just way more likely than these people got it from some higher intelligence. Both of them. A Combo of both. And how many different ancient civilizations tell you, tell the people where they got their, their knowledge. It's not just the Samaritans, they're all telling you there's an incredible monuments that were puzzled us today. We're telling you that dudes from Earth, from the heavens came down and showed us, but no one's bleeding. We're also telling you that a guy died and came back to earth three days later he turned water into

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       wine. But these, these are structures that actually you could see in their scientists. Baffled by what you mean, like structures and stuff in South America, the Mayans. Um, all the ancient Sumerian. Well, yeah. Well, the, the Mayans, you know, they did their shit is totally different. I mean they believe that a fucking plume snake created the universe. No, hold on a second now. That's exactly what I'm talking about. What? What is behind this story? Snake mushrooms like a motherfucker in the jungle. Hang it out. Banging hot. My in checks chilling. I mean that. No Internet. That's definitely an idea and possibility playing football with human heads. But I'm trying to figure out what are the realities behind the stories. I certainly think it's a possibility. I'm not ruling out that pause. Oh no, of course not. But you know, it is definitely a combination because the bottom line is that all these ancient cultures are very adamant and very specific in saying that this all happened because of a visit from beings from the stars.

Speaker 3:          00:36:45       The star thing is very prevalent. If it were a previous civilization or if it were, let's say, human beings. Because sometimes people say, well, how come you don't? How come you're not talking about that? Maybe a w. it's our civilization from the future travel into the past to help us with certain developments. Well, that can't be true because nowhere in the ancient texts do we find any reference where it says, well, we're just like you, but we're from the future. Maybe future bullshit artists. That's those little gray dudes. Are they just completely full of Shit? They're us from the future, but they fuck with us the same way we fuck with monkeys. If you, if you get in the cage, I'll give you a banana and the monkey gets in the cage and you just steal them. Take them to the zoo, given that banana. And he was like, what?

Speaker 3:          00:37:35       The crazy thing about Zachariah, essentially when people questioned his translations are the things that he got right in the seventies and they were finding out just today in 2000, one, 2002, that in the stories that he's talking about, the adult hockey, he saying in a nutshell that there's a hyper advanced wraith is created us as slaves to mine gold because they needed gold dust particles to suspend them. An atmosphere to protect our planet. Well, we just discovered in the 2000 thing, hey, you actually do protect atmospheres by suspending metallic product. How the hell did an archeologist know some astrophysics in the seventies? That's an intention. Yeah. Well it is possible that they were really sophisticated seven, 8,000 years ago and they knew that we were eventually going to run into the same problems again. I mean they, maybe they were burning shit back then that was eating up the ozone layer. Maybe they were fucking with chemicals back then just like we are now. But that. So that would mean that were super smart. Yeah. But they're telling you specifically

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       the reason why they to. Yes. Yeah. Well, they figured it out, figured it out, just like we figured it out now and they figured it out then. No, but they're telling you how they figured it out. They're saying they're saying they got it from the owner. Not Again, this. I don't know. See, I don't know enough about language to argue against or for switching, but I know that he's a road scholar.

Speaker 3:          00:38:58       He's not the only one though. I mean again, knockier to Sumerian stories are not the only stories that we find constraints for evidence Dogan mean they completely such detailed astronomical knowledge which was not corroborated it until the 19, early 19 sixties and there's still people that say, oh, this is a complete hoax when it really isn't. I mean they knew about invisible stars that were then later truly corroborated by NASA and other astrophysicists. I mean, how on earth would they know something like this and the Dogan give you the answers that they were visited by somebody that descended from the sky and then who are we to say that these people are lying or that they made up fantasy stories because that to me is the insult, right? When people,

Speaker 4:          00:39:50       we'll say salt the fuck out of some old tribes. Shit. No, no, no snakes.

Speaker 3:          00:39:56       I'm just referring to, you know, because because people archeologist the bunkers are saying, well, you know, you, you guys attribute everything to alien intervention and uh, you know, you undermine to human, human ingenuity. You're suggesting that, you know, our ancestors were stupid and, and nothing could be further from the truth because obviously nothing happened in our brain development in the last 50,000 years. If you bring someone from 10,000 years ago to today, you can teach that person how to drive a car. You can teach that person even to fly a plane, no problem. Because intellectually speaking they're as capable as we are today. However, there was one huge difference and that is their technological frame of reference was different or smaller than what we have today. So when we have stories of flying shields or dragons or smoking a snakes and plumes and plume snakes and things like that, then my question is, well, what was it exactly that our ancestors try to describe with their vocabulary because they didn't have the vocabulary for rocket or for, you know, so they had to liken a rocket to a blazing oven or something like this or you know, gleaming bronze, a monster and things like that.

Speaker 3:          00:41:18       So there in lies, lies the big difference. And so when archeologists and say, well, you know, you're saying that I undermine human ingenuity from the past. It's like, no, I'm really not because I am reading to you exactly that these same people said that they received their knowledge from these humanoid beings that the senate from the sky. So you think that that's the, uh, the most compelling piece of evidence to you is a human beings depictions of what was going on, like given us or you know. No, no, that is definitely. See that, and that's the great thing about the ancient alien theory that you can, you know, it's such an interdisciplinary field of research that, you know, you can look at ancient Egypt and you can look at South America and draw correlations. I mean they did. They found crazy correlations between those two cultures, for example, where they found cocaine in mummies and things like that where cocaine was only available in one country.

Speaker 3:          00:42:22       And so, so it was definitely, I mean, something definitely happened that there was trade between continents and personally I suggest that trait didn't necessarily happen on, on water, but that they actually had, you know, aircraft because that is what the ancient texts are saying, not only in India with the vimanas but also in, um, in the Hebrew and an Ethiopian cultures. Have you have the story of King Solomon and his flying carpet and it's flying machine. Didn't your show take an artifact and recreated? Explain that. Tell me about what happened there. Well, where was the artifact from? It's from South America, from Columbia, and it's a gold funerary objects. It's a totem that hundreds of thousands and thousands of those little artifacts have been found and they will usually shaped in the form of frogs and insects and fish and crocodiles and things like that. However, out of those thousands of funerary objects that have been found about eight were found worldwide that looked like modern day airplanes and so these two engineers in one, one doctor and one engineer in Germany, what they did is in the early, in the mid nineties, 1996, they took one of those little funerary objects and they blew it up to ratio and to size without adding an inch or subtracting an inch.

Speaker 3:          00:43:56       I mean they just basically blew it up to about three to four feet long and it looks exactly like exactly. And the. They put a propeller inside and they had tried multiple objects. I mean, they didn't just do one that they thought, well, this one is most likely like a looks most likely like a plane, so let's just do this. Well No, they took a whole bunch of them and they recreated them as, as model planes. A throw them up in the air and they were 100 percent aerodynamically sound. They were able to do roles and looping loops and stuff like that. I mean, they were 100 percent, uh, you know, there were airplanes and even to the untrained eye, uh, they, they look like planes because here's the thing that you know, a lot of people say about when they say that these are also fish or insects, but you look at that, that's an airplane because first of all it's got a delta shape and a fuselage and then you have the stabilizers in the back and you've got an upright rudder and no living creature in nature does not exist.

Speaker 3:          00:45:05       Plus the wing formation is a low wing formation. Where would have wings are attached to the bottom of the fuselage body. Exactly. And we have our wings are arms attached like a, the birds and the shoulder girdle. And that formation that we can find in the Colombian artifact does not. It doesn't. It doesn't suggest how old is that artifact? One thousand 500 to 1000, 600 years old. God Dang. Yeah. So totally. My region in Columbia and Pre-colombian artifact and it's uh, you know, so those are all those little things that all fit together. Some how, and in my opinion, they had something to do with flesh and blood aliens who visited in the remote past. It's so weird that our history is so incomplete. That's why we're having this debate. The reason why we're having this debate is because we know that the history so sketchy when you get just a few thousand years ago, that's all he fucking knows, man.

Speaker 3:          00:46:08       And it doesn't help when you get these conventional archaeologists that are so fucking set in their ways. Man, this Robert Schoch, John Anthony West thing that's going on in Egypt, in, pertaining to the dating of the Sphinx. I find their research fascinating. What I find more fascinating is how these mainstream egyptologist just just poo poo it. Like, oh, well where's the evidence for this culture? Like the, the argument they had was so childish. It was so egotistical that guy was standing up going, you know, you're talking about the Sphinx being predating, you know, 9,000 BC. Where's the evidence of this culture that's willing to do? Where's the evidence? Like, what the fuck do you think is going to be there, sir? What do you think is going to be there after 11,000 years? You're talking 9,000 BC. How much is going to be left? Man, I'll tell you what's going to be left rocks and there's your evidence geological ropps that are so fucked up by water that it has to be thousands of years of rainfall, you know that is unanimous.

Speaker 3:          00:47:07       When geologists look at the Sphinx enclosure and they and they show of photographs of the water, the water erosion of the fishers, they're 100 percent agreed that it's water erosion due to thousands of years of rain fall by the way rainfall to not just flooding, not like one crazy flood know thousands or many years, so that just shows you. It has to be older than 9,000 bc because that was the last time there was flooding or there's a rain forest in the Nile Valley know. And the crazy thing is also that their research is corroborated by other research as well. When my colleague Robert Boulevard came out with the Orion mystery and when he suggested that if you look at the great, the three great pyramids of Giza from a bird's eye perspective, you see that the three are sort of lined up but not completely. They're not in a straight line.

Speaker 3:          00:48:01       At the smallest pyramid is a bit off and he's like, well that's really strange, so what's going on here? And then he determined that these three pyramids are in fact built to the exact ratio of Orion to three stars in Orion's belt. The band heard though, that the only way you could see the three stars from that angle, you would have to look at everything upside down from like like that. It doesn't actually work that way, but it was disproven that you can you. You can see it that way, but not from Earth, not from. Not from the way we look at it. You would have to have reverse everything. Is that true? Yes. I mean look at the general idea still holds. Even though that the upside down theory is possibly correct. I am not sure of that, to be honest with you. I'm not sure what either I a video.

Speaker 3:          00:48:51       I think however, what he did determine is the fact that the time, if you were to put three floodlights on top of each tip of the pyramid and a fire it straight into the sky, you know, like at the bookstore in Las Vegas, the big been the time when the three tips of those pyramids would line up exactly with Orion spelled and you have software for this where you can rewind back the night sky and the computer these days. Um, it would be in 12,500, 12,000, 500 years ago, which bore a labeled or is known Egyptology as the golden age when the gods still walked amongst men. And so the fact that the pyramid, I mean the Sphinx also eight to 9,000 BC, well that's 1200. That's the golden age that everybody talks about in, in, in Egypt, and really learned thousand BC thousands of years earlier.

Speaker 3:          00:49:51       It has to exist because of the thousands of years of rainfall. So you are talking, it'd be 10,500 BC, maybe 11 or so. The fact is that the, and there are ancient texts that talk about these, uh, these, um, these previous cultures or your previous, uh, uh, periods of other kings and that lived in the Egyptian, a region, but they're considered to be fantasy stories by archeologists. The Pharaohs just like 34,000 years ago, aren't there? I mean, I believe John Anthony West has stated that he goes back almost 30,000 or more years. There is a, there is a king's list out there and everybody can go google this tonight. It's called WB 44. And that kings list absolutely will boggle your mind because it basically lists a combined age of kings that ruled for a half a million years before our culture. Now it's absolutely, it's absolutely crazy. And so, and that is a list that can be found at the British Museum in England, in London.

Speaker 3:          00:51:05       Where's it from? It's from some area and the WB 44. And it lists for how long, how long, how old? For hundreds of thousands of years. And some of these kings, it says, I have root for 16,000 years for 48,000 years, one day, one king. And then the question is, well, how is this even possible that operate the great type shit that were working that back then, man? Or they are, we're talking about time, dilation, time, dilation. If you travel at close to the speed of light, if on your spaceship, five years pass and you travel at 99 point nine percent of the speed of light, 5,000 years pass here on earth. And that's just the theory of relativity, which is uh, you know, and it takes a time, dilation into account. I mean, like anyone that flies a lot, those people are actually aging slower than the rest of us.

Speaker 3:          00:52:02       So the more you are in motion, the slower you age. And so this is a mathematically viable and proven theory that if you travel clothes, which, which of course we, we are not capable of doing it. But just because we human beings can't do it doesn't mean it does not exist. And that's the big, you know, arc is dude would like come down here, fuck some shit and go yo, I'll be right back. Then it comes back like 16,000 years because to him it's only a year. Yep, exactly. It goes to the speed of light or whatever the hell he goes. And he comes back. Yes. And it sounds like science fiction. But who says that? That is not possible. That's an interesting way to stay valid. It just say, listen bitch, I am coming back and then you actually do come back and don't. And those are the stories that we find that these, quote unquote gods, which by the way, they never existed.

Speaker 3:          00:52:58       It's all lower case g, there is no such thing as God's. I mean it's, it's, it's completely, uh, it was a complete misunderstanding, a misinterpretation of our ancestors who didn't understand the nuts and bolts technologies behind these visits. And so they started to worship these people and those visitors knew exactly that they were being worshiped because you know, it will be the same thing that if we arrive on a planet one day in the future, $5,000 or whatever years from now and we find a quote unquote intelligent species, but they're a bit primitive. Yeah, well, you know, we'll push them a little bit in the right direction, show them how to, you know, to complete agriculture and medicine and architecture and all those things. And then we'll just say, okay, we're, we're gonna disappear again. Well guess what? Our once real visit will turn into will enter the realm of mythology a thousand or 2000 years after our visit.

Speaker 3:          00:53:58       And so one day all of us, all human beings will become ancient astronauts on some other planets. It's just, it's just the eternal. We'll have a question of, you're a master of ancient cultures. Most ancient culture to get, get up, get up close to the engine cultures, have some kind of 2012 a warning or a signifies the end of some age. Or what do you think, you know, I, uh, you know, I really need you to pay attention to this because I think that the biggest threat that we face on December 22nd 2012 is the massive hangover will all be suffering. So that's about it because a lot of 2012 stuff with a Zacharias of course. So, you know, here's the thing that would message and think through was gonna, you know, even though took a year away, when we build it, look, here's the thing that, you know, the whole thing, in my opinion is nothing else but a complete.

Speaker 3:          00:55:08       Um, it's, it's a mass hysteria. Absolutely. Because now, yeah, well, he, even, he, uh, he wrote right before or a year before he died, he rephrased his, um, theory by saying that if, if, if at all in the bureau were to return, it's going to be around 20, 36 or 38 or something changed it. Absolutely. Yes. But you know, that's neither here nor there because the bottom line is that the big problem with 2012 is the fact that it's not even 2011 right now. That's what nobody talks about, that you know, we, our calendar is wrong because if there's a couple of arguments that you can make, and that is, you know, if you look at our code and code history, we went from one BC, two, one add without a year zero, which means that we are already at least by one year off. So it's either 2012 or ready or it's still 2010.

Speaker 3:          00:56:09       And then you know, we don't know whether or not our calendar. We also know that Jesus was not born in the year zero, but scholars and I'm talking theologians, theological scholars now have determined that Jesus was born between five and three add. So right, they're worn exactly. So right there, we've got another five years considering the fact that we were being told that our calendar began ticking on the day of Jesus's birth. So long story short in the third, our third argument is also that it isn't now Berkeley scholars and scholars in the university in a university in Rome have determined that in the Middle Ages when the monks were in charge of recording our dates and everything like that, that they also made a mistake up to five years. So the interesting thing is that to make a long story short that we could be as far off as 10 years with our current date and if you take into consideration when did our calendar really start ticking?

Speaker 3:          00:57:25       Was it at the, at the time when Jesus died or was it at the time when he was nailed to the cross? Who knows these things? I mean some have suggested that we're off by 200 years and these are not people that, you know, I'm just pulling this stuff out of their butts, but they are scholars at universities who have studied this stuff. And so the bottom line is that the whole 2012, it's nothing else but complete hysteria and nothing. Let me repeat. Absolutely nothing will happen next year. Dude, what you got to talk to Daniel Pinchbeck because he's written books and he doesn't agree with you. That's fine. He thinks quite so positive and God bless them and quit. So creditable, not come. Now, that didn't. By the way, by the way, quizlet. Corrado was an exit terrestrial spaceship. Do you think so? Absolutely. Didn't they predict that um, the Mayans pr accurately predicted the solar lunar eclipses in the future.

Speaker 3:          00:58:28       So if they predicted that, how is it possible that we say they predicted it, right? We must be following their timeline. If following their timeline, then the must be 2012. Oh No, absolutely. You're right. But if, if our calendar from the very beginning was, is wrong, then we are basing our wrong calendar on their calculation. Right? But if we're basing our wrong calendar on their calculations and it lines up with what we call 19, 19 with, we call it 2012, then shouldn't it be that they got the lunar eclipses right? So they got 2012, right? No, they definitely have 2012. Right? And by the way, the deal, yes, but not yes in their counting in their town but not ours. Yes. But how is their accounting like line up exactly with ours when it comes to the prediction of solar and lunar eclipses then? Well, soon and lunar eclipses it doesn't matter what you're in.

Speaker 3:          00:59:26       Right? But they, they accurately depicted the year that the solar and lunar eclipses according to our talent. But we impose, we super imposed. They're counting onto ours. So we tried to make it fit. Yes, exactly. Okay. So you see, and here's the other thing that's tricky when you get to calendars to right, like one a completely different type of calendar than ours. And so there must be something happened and then to December 20, first 2012, I must signify at the end of the 13th, what does that mean? And that is the long couch and that is the exact thing that you know, the Mayans, not once, not once did they ever say that the world was going to end. The only thing they said is that one period of time ends and a new period of time begins. So it could be that you know, if you believe, some people believe that time has a certain qualities to it, that there are times when things are easier and times and things are harder and that this is literally like an ebb and flow, like the tines and that perhaps with the Mayans were predicting is just some new stage of humanity, some new stage of existence, some new states with the earth and the universe that this thing just things just keep flowing in this sort of a circular direction.

Speaker 3:          01:00:43       Well, yeah, I mean look at everything as we know is, is cyclical. So yeah. So that is definitely in this. They mastered the procession of the equinoxes and they had figured that out. They had figured out a lot of cycles that would really complex who taught them this and they're also very true mushrooms and a lot of free time also. So the aliens who were dressed up as little mushroom mascot, what it is, what do you say to people that say, well, how do we know Jesus really even exist? They're like dvds and stuff that did was that DVD, the God that God wasn't there. It wasn't that there was a lot of kind of argue scientifically that he's not a, not a real figure. I, you know, I personally think that Jesus, 100 percent was a historical figure. He was an alien. No, no, no.

Speaker 3:          01:01:36       And, and neither was Buddha and neither were any of the other quote unquote astronaut. No, no, I just think that, you know, Jesus was a historical figure, was able to move people, but uh, that, that, uh, he was the son of God, in my opinion, is nonsense because we are all the sons and daughters of God. We all have the divine within our hearts. So what kind of proof, I mean, you've studied a lot of ancient cultures, obviously. What do you know of any proof that. What did Jesus exist exactly? Well, I mean, we've had, we have stories. We have texts that have been written down at the time, the, like the Qumran texts to have the Dead Sea scrolls and things like that. So, I mean, obviously nobody took a picture and the, you know, there are some in Texas where you get real squirrely because the dead sea scrolls, that's where it's the trace it back to an ancient Sumerian where Christ is an ancient Sumerian word that means a mushroom covered in God's semen.

Speaker 3:          01:02:36       Well, interesting on Marco Allegro Story. Yes. Although interestingly enough, what's also fascinating, what many people don't know is that before Jesus, they were 15 other crucified, quote unquote saviors in human history. And so it's all very bizarre that, uh, you know, Christianity claims that he was the only one which is completely untrue. And when you measure his story next to all these other stores, I mean, even Hercules, Hercules and Jesus, pretty fucking close. Lot of Goddamn similarities. You know, it's, it's, it's pretty obvious that we've always been looking for a savior. I've always been looking for a one, a one thing. And I think that's just some Alpha male chimpanzee thing. When you look for the Alpha and you think somehow, you know, the one at one point in time there was a super alpha and the Super Alpha had all the answers. Is it just a myth to keep people going?

Speaker 3:          01:03:33       What does that mean? What is the need for this, this Super Alpha? Do you think that it signifies this alien intervention in human history? Is that what you're. Is that what you personally believe? No, I, I just think that a lot of times people are not happy with their own thoughts that they need to, but this Athena, one time, there was a god. The theme exists in all of them. All of the different religions all talk about one point in time there was a god and this God had all the answers. This is the shit that he wrote down, but this is the shit that he told me. Here's the thing that you know, I mean, uh, if you want to look at the Old Testament where we have a description of quote unquote God in the ancient astronaut opinion, whatever or whoever with described in the Old Testament, and this is exclusively referring to the Old Testament, has nothing to do with you'll shit.

Speaker 3:          01:04:31       Yes. That whatever or whoever was described in the old testament by all means was not God. That being or that humanoid x, uh, a creature that was here was misinterpreted or thought as God as something divine, something spiritual, something more advanced. It was 100 percent Jesus because Jesus was an alien. No, I just said that has nothing to do with the New Testament, Old Testament, old testament. God was an alien and Jesus, no, it was not god. That's the thing that I thought it was God. Because see, a lot of people say, well, does that mean you were an atheist? Does that mean you don't believe in God? And you know, because a lot of the bunkers, or actually creationists are always using Albert Einstein as their best example, where they say, see even Albert Einstein, he believes in God, so you know, we must be right with our ideas.

Speaker 3:          01:05:35       Well, that is only half of the story because when Albert Einstein was asked as a journalist, a, when a journalist asked Albert Einstein, do you believe in God? What Einstein said, and anyone can go and look this up, is the fact that he replied by saying, well, dear journalist, before I can answer your question, we have to define what your definition or your idea of God is. And then the journalists said, well, I believe in the Old Testament, God and creator. And then Albert said, well, if that is your definition of God, than I respectfully will tell you that I do not believe in God and Tony's like wells in. So what are you talking about? An Einstein then explained his definition are his idea of God and the universe and the order that we have in the universe. And it's chaos. And he said, and if that is what what, and this to me is my idea of God, that there is some order to the universe because you know, God does not throw dice.

Speaker 3:          01:06:45       That's one of his most famous quotes. So there in lies the difference that, yes, I do think that there is an all encompassing force out there, but it's not a personal god, it's not where, you know, I pray and then all of a sudden, you know, I'm praying for something to happen. I mean that to me is a waste of time to be honest with you. It's like if you want something to happen, you gotta go out there and do it yourself no matter what. But I think the reason why the idea of prayer exists is because people can manifest things with their own thoughts and staying positive and focusing on a goal and make yes to a certain extent but thought. But, but that to me is just thought that the idea of prayer, prayer is just advanced thought, right? Just a moment to the moment that they see that they're in, to me, that's where it gets wacky.

Speaker 3:          01:07:34       Because the moment that you correlate your own power, your own, uh, you know, the connection to the universe that you have, the moment that you connect that to a personal God and put everything that you have, you basically deny all responsibility and you say, okay, fine, God will take care of it. That to me is such a cop out attitude. It's like, you know, why know, be responsible for your own actions and don't rely on someone. I completely agree. But I think that that's where the idea of prayer came from. The reason why it exists to this day, because you can sort of make things happen if you focus on them for a long period of time. And people who have been successful at making things happen have like stepped back and said, look, you know, we made this happen by prayer. We've thought this through. Can we get a crop top or open it up?

Speaker 3:          01:08:29       I'll just need one stop coughing for a little second. Poor little sicky Brian. Now, um, you've been doing this for a long time now. You said 1998. You started out your, your, your magazine. How do you get approached to be doing this ancient alien show? How does this happen? Did they just seek out people with, you know, sort of fringe beliefs and people that are experts on these subjects? No. It was actually a very funny story and that was, if you remember, in 2008 that New Indiana Jones movie came out the Kingdom of the crystal skull and it's kind of a disaster of a movie. I, in my opinion, but they're making another one. Can you believe it? To redeem themselves? I hope they get worse. It can't get. It can't get worse. They just don't seem to make in the same. Anyway, the great thing about the movie itself was the idea behind it was great, but the execution was horrid.

Speaker 3:          01:09:25       It was basic. An ancient alien movie where, you know, he was chasing the crystal skull. The Crystal Skull happened to be an extra terrestrial origin, this and that. So, um, the history channel made a two hour documentary about Indiana Jones and the feasibility behind, uh, you know, all this stuff that he chased down. And so it was one segment about crystal skulls in which I appeared and talked about the possibility whether to Chris Mitchell hedges skull, for example, was in fact, or could in fact be an extraterrestrial artifact. And the Mitchell hedges skull is what is that the Mitchell had skull is one of the most perfect, the most perfect crystal m I t c h e l l dash hedges h e d g e s Mitchell, hedges skull. And that skull was found in beliefs by, by Michel headrest daughter on her birthday. And uh, it's this crystal clear crystal that was found in the shape of a humanoid head.

Speaker 3:          01:10:36       I mean, it's massive. It's really big. If you go to the CRA, Mitchell hedges.com, they have a countdown to revelation. It's gloom and doom once again. I mean, it's just crazy. It's dope looking skull. And what did you say about this called? And some of them have been disproved, right? But this one hasn't. And then there's no question about that. And the fact that, you know, with this one here, it's, it's so magnificent where the, you can actually detach the jawbone, uh, from it any which means that the pain, it's from the same crystal, which means it had to be one big fricken rock out of which this whole thing was, was made. And when was it found? Are they in the early 19 hundreds? And when, when Mitchell hedges or the actual, um, caretaker a after Mitchell had just died and, and Anna took over or kept the skull, she and her, this other dude who's name escapes me right now, I think it's Dan in this arena or something.

Speaker 3:          01:11:38       They brought it in the 19 sixties to the labs up in the bay area of Hewlett Packard. And even in the day, of course, only the best scientists worked at these particular, uh, you know, factories and labs. And when the Hewlett Packard scientists, we're done with all their research, their conclusion was very simple. And they said, and I quote, this, golf should not exist. And a meaning that it was, they did not find any tool marks that did not find any polished or any evidence that this thing was polished or anything like that. And even more crazy is the fact that each crystal, it grows in a particular access. And in order to work crystal, you have to turn to crystal at high speeds in that direction of the access. And according to the Hewlett Packard people, it was ground against its grain and that would shatter every crystal that you would do this too.

Speaker 3:          01:12:46       And the crystal Hydros I mean the Mitchell, his skull, um, it, it still exists and it shouldn't. So it's, it's a big mystery and yes, like, you know, some crystal skulls have been determined that they are, you know, modern day creations, but not to Mitchell address. Again, that could be another tool that we're not. They used to have back in the day that we're not thinking about that. Right, of course, of course. Sure. Of course. So this is how you got hooked up with the history channel and then they're like, we like to do with crazy hair, you know, anything about Nazis. No. And denied. Then I got a call and I was asking, you know, have I had, I heard of a, of a book called chariots of the Gods and Eric Fund, Danica. And I said, of course, you know, we publish a magazine together in this and that and here we are today. I mean, it was just a, an idea to, to shoot a, a two hour documentary 40 years after chariots of the gods, an argument

Speaker 4:          01:13:43       with a journalist when I first came to Hollywood wasn't really an argument. It was a talk at one of these. They had these, uh, it was fox, I was on Fox and had a party for a Sitcom I was on. And a guy said, hey, can I ask you a couple of questions? And he goes, okay. So he rattles off a bunch of questions and one of them was, do you believe in aliens? And uh, I think I said yeah. And he said, why? And I said, well, I saw this thing, chariots of the gods, and it's a pretty incredible movie and I think it's, it's more

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       than possible. It's a lot of stars out there. And he started going off on how chariots of the gods it was bullshit. And he goes, oh, it's been completely debunked. And so I'm pretty calm about that kind of stuff. I go, alright, well how is it debunked? And he had no answer. And I said, but yet you're so convinced that as debunked. But I know, I know I read that had been debunked. I go, but you don't remember what you read, but yet what did, did you reach out to the gods? And he's like, no, I didn't read it, but I mean, I know it's all about aliens. And aliens came and made these structures and was like, wow, dude, you're pretty convinced. But it was like a sensible man doesn't believe such silly things. And that is the, the whole attitude about aliens, about extra terrestrials or even about ancient civilizations.

Speaker 3:          01:14:53       And these sensible man doesn't buy into such nonsense. And you must have had to deal with that your whole fucking life. Oh No, absolutely. And that's the thing where you just go wacky with the hair and the jewelry and I fucking bitch. I'm going deep. Yeah. Crazy whole. I'm still the same guy from 10 years ago, you know, that's the thing that, you know, it's like, to me, you know, especially the chariots of the gods argument that, you know from Danica has been debunked and things like that. It's like really, I mean, have you looked at this stuff? Because the bottom line is that chariots of the gods had over 200 question marks in it and even had a fricking question wanting to fucking title. So, I mean, right, there was a question. It is a idea. It's raising questions. And if those questions happen to be uncomfortable questions, well, you know what, so be it because a couple of them are wrong.

Speaker 3:          01:15:46       You're talking about a lot of Goddamn questions. No. Here's the thing. And let me, let me ask you this. When was the last time you saw as scientist or, or any author or whatever, uh, give, uh, you know, 30 years after they first publication and say, well, you know, on page, so and so, I made a mistake when chariots of the gods came out as the 35 year addition to 35 year anniversary edition. Eric wrote a 16 page of preface to the new edition. And in that he pointed out exactly what we, which mistakes he made in the 1968 or 1970 brooke on what page? And on, you know, what happened here, for example, one example is the, that uh, uh, the iron pillar in New Delhi for a long time, you know, we thought that this might be something that is of extraterrestrial origin or at least that extra terrestrials taught nice metallurgist.

Speaker 3:          01:16:50       How to poor this, a pillar of iron because up to that time it didn't corrode. It didn't rust. And it's been, it had been around for many, many years, know hundreds and hundreds of years. And guess what, the thing is rusting today. It's corroding. So you know what that piece of evidence out the, you know what, who cares? Because the conclusion is that it in in case a piece of evidence turns out to be wrong or false. If you eliminate that piece of evidence, it only makes the overall theory stronger because you eliminate false stuff. So to suggest that just because there were a few mistakes and chairs of the gods which Eric openly admitted to, that doesn't mean that the whole ancient alien theory all of a sudden becomes irrelevant. On the contrary, it makes it more stronger. And the fact that today, especially on the show, ancient aliens, I mean, by the way, tomorrow is the premier of season three.

Speaker 3:          01:17:52       I'm very excited about that. What's going on? What's going well? Can you preview us? Can you tell us to have some scoops? Any Nazi stuff? There's definitely stuff in there that has not been explored in the previous season. History channel needs to combine Nazis, Ufo and ghost together and monsters. One are fucking smash them up show. And uh, you know, so I lost my train of thought was a season of the history exactly his special, especially now in season three. It's amazing how many university professors have come forward and agreed to be on a show called ancient fucking aliens. Are you kidding me? The fact that university professors, because as you know, you, you're in TV, you have to disclose what show you're calling from or what show you're going to be on. You can't just, you know, put a question mark there. So the fact that university professors are now coming forward, especially for season three to appear on that show, I mean that speaks volumes.

Speaker 3:          01:19:00       I mean, it's huge that, that all of a sudden, you know, Eric von Daniken children's and I and Martell and coppens, we're surrounded by people from mit talking about ancient aliens and what exactly these, uh, professors about what is their, their, their subjects of expertise, what do they, uh, well, we, we've, for example, in this episode that airs tomorrow and Aliens and the old West, we have a professor is not only do we have elders, a native American elders who are talking about the idea of star people in, in the ancient American west, but also there are professors that we've gotten from universities and curators of museums where they corroborate the stories about the star people. And so which one do they do that well because they, they are, uh, they have access to many, many recordings that were written down by a previous, um, in the old west. Things for the first time would be able to be recorded because in ancient native American times their traditions were brought from generation to generation and words.

Speaker 3:          01:20:19       Spoken words. Exactly. And then when white men came, I guess unfortunately the, you know, the whole thing was recorded all of a sudden. And so we have very old recordings talking about these star people that came allegedly a long time ago. And so that is a huge, huge part of our theory that there are entire cultures, for example, native Americans that talk about the Kachinas descending from the sky in flying shields. And they were very adamant because of course native Americans, you know, believe in the spiritual realm, there's no question, but they're also very adamant to say that there are two worlds, there is the spiritual realm. And then there is also the physical realm and vet the star. People were part of the physical realm. And here we are to say, oh well, you know, they didn't know what they were talking because they were just all, hi there, we're getting that pod.

Speaker 3:          01:21:26       Which, you know, I mean, of course there is not one culture in the world that did not dabble in, in mind altering drugs. I mean, it's just a, a, a complete, uh, it's who we are as a people. There is no question about that, but at the same time there were always these different levels that yes, there's absolutely no doubt in my mind that the spiritual realm does exist, but we also have a physical realm in which our ancestors said that somebody came in a physical form, so you think that there's probably some sort of an advanced life or some sort of a different life in a, in a nonmaterial form as well. Like there's some sort of a spiritual realm, 100 percent chin or something like have something, something else, some sort of intelligent life, and then there's physical life is, and you know me, I'm the nuts and bolts alien guy.

Speaker 3:          01:22:25       Right? But at the same time I would be a fool to deny or to even suggest that that a ethereal realm does not exist because that would render our physical world completely useless if that's all there is. Because a lot of people are saying, well, you know, if you die, all it's going to happen is that, you know, they're gonna basically just pull the plug from the computer. Hard drive and things like that. And that's usually the argument that they give, but the bottom line is that's not necessarily true because if you keep your computer in a very safe place and you can leave it there unplugged for a years. If you find a power source a million years down the road and you plug that computer back in, guess what? Everything on that hard drive is still there. So what if the hard drive is to soul?

Speaker 3:          01:23:17       And therefore once we die, our souls goes with us. That's who we are as an essence. Yes we will leave this body, but at the same time energy does not die. It goes on in some form. So to suggest that after this life, it's all over. I cannot process that. Do Kurtzweil and Ray Kurzweil's ideas of downloading human consciousness into, into intelligent computers. And the idea of your, you will be able to duplicate yourself and live forever in some sort of cyber environment. I think it's fascinating and you know what happens with the, you know, the spiritual version of you. If that takes place, you know, well maybe then that's where you live inside that, inside that saddle zombies. Yeah, no, but the thing is you see, and that's why you know, movies like the Matrix are so the first one was so wonderful because those are all fantastic, interesting ideas.

Speaker 3:          01:24:16       But to me I'm a big subscriber to reincarnation and uh, what I think because that because of energy not being able to die, and I think our soul, our essence, his energy, it's part of this all encompassing force that to me is the universe or God. And so you know, if you have, if you look for example, at the dialogue or a lot of Buddhists who believe in reincarnation or Hindus and things like that, they always talk about how you will get reincarnated here on planet earth as another being or another animal or whatever. But see, to me that's all very limited thinking because while I do subscribe to reincarnation, there is no way, in my opinion that we would only reincarnate here on earth. We can reincarnate throughout the entire universe. And that is why some people, when they come back to Earth, they're considered maybe old souls or they're more intuitive to everything that they might've been here before.

Speaker 3:          01:25:17       So using this one universal bank of souls for the entire universe and that everybody has to tip into it no matter what you know, on planet fucking serious or whatever, you know, you, you, you all did for the same souls. And so like, you could die here and then reemerge on planet, go fuck yourself in the middle of nowhere and somehow somehow with a, but somehow with the same quote unquote instinct or knowledge because there's something that's out there. It's called the, the eternal spirit. And that is, uh, that we all consist of, of particles and elements. And every 60 days our entire bodies are, are completely recycled because I mean, we're, we're completely changing tickets every seven years. Oh, okay. Well, whatever I did or it's the, it's the complete resection of a body, which is absolutely mind boggling. Yeah, it's pretty crazy. It's seven years and we're being bombarded by this cosmic dust.

Speaker 3:          01:26:11       And that is what we consist of. And this is one of French philosopher John Shiran in his book called the eternal spirit. Uh, the internal internal particles suggested that, um, each time one of our particles in our body travels through the universe, no matter what it passes through, if it's a stone or a or some type of a being or something, it records everything. And so, you know, each and every particle contains the knowledge of the entire universe. And that's within us. I mean, it's the theory of things. Recording things by Rupert Sheldrake, Tony, you know who he is. Yes, he has a, some sort of theory that things contained memory, houses, tables, chairs, everything. Because we're all made of the same stuff. And if that, you know, if these particles all record the same stuff, then you know, we are all one. See if you take a piece of skin and you put it underneath the electron microscope and you go deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper, everything wobbles.

Speaker 3:          01:27:17       Everything vibrates. It's all exciting down there. And uh, you know, that's just who we are. We consist of a vibration frequency. It's all harmonics. Now you take a piece of this Metal Cup right here, which is considered to be inorganic or dead material and you put a little little piece under the same electron microscope and you go deeper and deeper and deeper. At the very, very core, it's the exact same thing and I would challenge you for 100 bucks to tell me which is which. Nobody can tell. I can tell the difference unless you know exactly which means we all exist of the same stuff. Don't we all exist? It actually has nothing. I mean isn't like most of the universe and nothing changed. The universe's most. Mostly Adams and most adams are almost entirely nothing and end. We consist of nothing too because while we can touch ourselves and touch other people and the sensation of touch and all this, it's all complete its magnetism.

Speaker 3:          01:28:21       I mean, should use that as a trial, you know, grab some chicks ass. I've touched nothing was nothing to touch. I have a question. A lot of the stuff you're saying I agree with and a lot of stuff they're saying. Edgar Casey for instance, he was a. he, he believed in the Akashic records and then he, um, he can put them, he put his, he put himself under hypnosis, right? Yes. Self hypnosis. And then when he was an under south hypnosis, he became this brilliant all knowing man. And he had a third grade education and he's, he said that he's all, this information can be tapped into by anybody. Just got to learn like meditation is part of it and that's why there's a big, you know, meditation is huge and Yoga is huge because once you master meditation, you actually can tap into the Akashic records which holds the answers to everything.

Speaker 3:          01:29:18       Where you Edgar Casey Fan, did you follow him at all? No, actually I really don't know much about him. But uh, you know, it is true that you see we only use about five percent of our entire brain power. Is that really true? I've heard that's been debunked. Well, even if let's say, let's say it's, let's say it's 10 percent, don't even think that's true. I think they've debunked it. I think that was back when people were ignorant as about the functions of different areas of the brain and now they've attributed different areas of the brain, two different functions and I think the more they understand about the brain, the more they realize that that's, that's a misnomer. Have you driven down to four or five? You know, he's still, believe it or not, I'm not. I'm not saying that these people are thinking, well, they even said like if you use more than 10 percent at the same time, it would just go into seizures and stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:30:06       I think that's all worship. I think that's all been disproven. I'm almost positive. Yeah, I believe what you were saying. Well anyway, so, so the idea, let's, let's operate under the assumption that you know, we, we only use about eight, five to eight percent of our total brain power is one guy suggested a philosopher. He said that the brain is the last untamed beast in the universe. And that is true because every single thing that we see each day, every single thing that we hear, everything that we say, our brains records it all. Everything is there, everything is there permanently for eternity in our brains. The only problem is we can't access the information. And then of course there are people who are great at, you know, memorizing lines or memorizing texts or, or whatever or you know, we'll have photographic memory, autism where they could, I mean, well, you know, and, and also, you know, normally quote unquote functioning people.

Speaker 3:          01:31:09       I mean, you know, it's, it's, uh, it's amazing how, you know, some people have the code and code gift to recall certain things and some people don't. And that is where I think, you know, the last frontier lies that, uh, we could conceivably access way more of our brain power and then you could move proverbial mountains. The 10 percent of the brain is absolutely a myth. Yeah. It's, yeah, it's absolutely been proven. It is actually a misinterpretation, a misquote of Albert Einstein or the misinterpretation of the work of Pierre Florins in the 18 hundreds. It's a, we use 100 percent of our brain. They haven't mapped out. They know what part of your brain works for different areas that did not know at a certain point in time in history. And that's when people started, you know, kind of chirping that and sending it back and forth.

Speaker 3:          01:31:56       So through the wonders of the Internet, we just cleared that up. And this is why you never stop learning. Never. Every day you learn something new. Um, what do you think about all this Nazi shit because, uh, one of the things that's fascinating about the ancient aliens show is how much the Nazis were into the occult and uh, the, the, the Mahabharata and trying to recreate things that were in ancient scriptures mean being Indiana Jones thing. They kind of got into it with the, um, the um, the, what is it called, the Ark of the covenant and you know, and that there's. So there's something to it. And the Nazis were obsessed with that shit, but if they were just some fucking Kooks, you know, which they clearly were in one way, but there were also sell fucking vance with rocketry. And with science and you know, I mean somebody companies came out of Nazi Germany, you know, there's just Germany period for getting the Nazi matter.

Speaker 3:          01:32:54       So, I mean, the Porsche started there, you know, bmw, some, somebody, sophisticated engineers there were so advanced. What the fuck was there? A big thing about Ufo is where was the whole Nazi ufo connection because that was one of the most fascinating ancient aliens to me. Yeah, no, look, I mean there's definitely something that can be said about this. And uh, the whole idea because many scholars say that, you know, Hitler and the Nazis were never into the occult and that is simply untrue because we have found or they found a documents because they're, the Nazis were immaculate. The record keepers as we know, and uh, it says that these expeditions to the North Pole to find openings at the North Pole and the South Pole, that these expeditions truly did exist, that the real society and the Tulip society really existed in things like that. And I personally find fascinating.

Speaker 3:          01:33:52       But I gotta be honest with you. You know that to me it's not ancient enough. Talk about Egos because that was 70 years ago. My, my ancient aliens, uh, you know, some people consider a 70 year old people, ancient, but you know, I don't. So uh, my aliens happened thousands of years, so you a Sumerian Mesopotamia and Egypt, ancient Greece and things like that, but at the same time, you know, you just never know. And it would be foolish to not listen to those stories or to look at these opinions because you just never know. Just be open at all times. Isn't there like a bunch of faces and paintings that have like old a drawing is an alien's on them and stuff like that. And have those been disproven or have those, uh, are, are the. Because I've seen a few of them where they're like, yeah, this is an alien.

Speaker 3:          01:34:46       I'm like, yeah, that or it's just a guy that has his head shaved and the artists sucks, you know, if you've done in any research on that kind of stuff or. No, I mean one of the greatest, uh, quote unquote pieces of evidence we have is, you know, the, the deaf, the, um, the carvings that we find, but also the figurines and drawings on vases, like what you were saying and there really are compelling figurines and compelling drawings that compared to modern days are eerily similar to modern day astronauts suits and you know, a lot of times that the bunkers are like, okay, so you're suggesting that the aliens we're here and why on earth would they wear to same suits or why would they need suits like our modern day astronauts because they were only a little more advanced us. Right? Exactly. But there were us in 100 years but we would need suits.

Speaker 3:          01:35:45       Right? But that. But that's the exact argument that if we can't go to the moon without a suit, so why would aliens if they're, you know, have oxygen based to people as we are or, or, or people that need to breathe oxygen for, for their life support. So to suggest that aliens are so vastly different than us that I have a hard time with that. I mean, there's some people that have suggested that aliens are just these, you know, uh, blobs of slime and I'm like, okay, that's possible. But, you know, that would define nature because nature is very efficient and I think that the building blocks that are requirements for life are pretty much a given throughout the entire universe. And so that if something happens here, you know, to, to think that aliens would exist, like in the Hollywood movies, that's a bit too much for me.

Speaker 3:          01:36:40       I mean, look, it's great entertainment, but do I think that that is how it is in reality? Not really. I think that we're all pretty much, you know, the same out there, um, you know, more advanced obviously, but it looks nice because all those ancient uh, carvings or descriptions and paintings that we have, you know, especially if you look at the ancient Hindu gods, they look like us. Beautiful. But just with blue skin for example, but they weren't, they didn't have four in India. Yes, they did have 20 arms, but you know, so it's definitely something to be said that, you know, we think that we have depictions that show potential exit through restroom visits, visitors in the past. You must dominate some late night hippie pussy sitting around with, you know what I'm saying, sitting around smoking weed with some chicks at a party and you drop some of this ancient alien knowledge dude, you must just knock it out of the fucking park.

Speaker 3:          01:37:43       Or should I say have in the past or should I say have the potential to. I don't say you use it for evil. Never evil, never evil. Do you believe in or what do you think about the reptilian shape? Shifting genre, complete nonsense. The David acres. So many nonsense. He's got so many good points but a little things. But you mentioned Shane shapeshifting earlier this the possibility to turn into clouds are trees. Yeah, but I. But I would not say that that's only reserved for reptilians. I mean, look, I really think that. I don't know. I mean the whole argument with the whole reptilian thing. Look, it really doesn't matter because what this theory or this whole extra terrestrial question is about is whether or not extraterrestrial life not only has been here, but also whether they're here right now and you know what, whether their reptilian or if they look like link the Loompa's he doesn't matter.

Speaker 3:          01:38:52       The fact is that having an extraterrestrial presence on planet earth, not only today, but for thousands of years, that is sensational enough then to suggest, yeah, you know, they're coming from planet so and so their space ships name is so and so. Their commander's name was so and so. I mean, that is, to me, all irrelevant garbage and that is why the mainstream is not listening to these stories because they're completely, it's complete buffoonery to suggest, you know, what plant they're from, what their spaceships name was with the propulsion system was. I mean, it's all nonsense. Who gives a shit extra terrestrials we're an art here. That's all that should matter to you. That I'm sorry. No, no, no. Do you um, believe Robert Loser? Do you believe his stories? You know, I was just thinking about him. Him and John Lear, John Lear's, out of the craziest theories ever, John Lear believes that there are millions of humanoids on every planet in the solar system and we've been to all the planets.

Speaker 3:          01:39:58       There's a CPA, he's Kooky, crazy shit. But, but Robert Lasar is not so cookie. Robert Lazard is a, I think he's probably full of shit about some things for sure. But he's also a very intelligent guy and god damn, he sounds confident as fuck when he gives you his depictions to pictures of what happened at area 51 and where he worked. And you know, it's interesting, you know, uh, I don't, I don't know if he's telling the truth, but from what I understand, he lied about his education. He lied about where he went to school and they've, you know, they've proven that he didn't get degrees where he said he got degrees. So I dunno, you know, but again, could be more disinflation, could be more. He was really good friends with John later. They were buddies. And that's not good because that John Lear guys out to lunch, or John Lear says that the moon is a spaceship right now. He says that that's where your soul goes to. It's a song catcher. When you die, your soul goes to the moon. See, that to me is nonsense. It's just right there and say, okay, look, never say never.

Speaker 3:          01:41:05       But that right there, you're going to lose the mainstream audience. And listen, that Guy John, I'd say, if anybody's a dis information guys, John Lear, lear jets, guys worth fucking $50 million dollars is out there running around talking about the moon, catching souls. When you die, you live in Ron. Jeremy, tell us about some episodes that some subject or subjects that you guys are going to cover that you didn't cover. The first two things because he did the cowboy thing. That's pretty good. Yeah, no, but for example, we're talking about the entire churches and buildings that were, that are carved into the ground in Ethiopia at zoom and Baylor were apparently a a version or possibly the Ark of the covenant is still buried in a town called act soon. Now that's what got Graham Hancock into his whole journey that he went on. He wouldn't say mainstream reporter, and he was covering some political unrest in Ethiopia and he started talking to some of the people that guard the temple that where they say the Ark of the covenant is inside.

Speaker 3:          01:42:13       And uh, he, uh, was very compelled by the evidence and the history behind it. And what do you think about it? Well, for example, I mean every week they have a procession through the town where they carry a replica of the Ark around and uh, it's obviously a replica. Unfortunately, you, nobody has access to the arc except for this family, for who, for generations have been guarding this arc. And what's really fascinating is that each and every guardian of that arc, they eventually go blind, which is really fascinating to think that, you know, you're guarding this object that only you are allowed to see if at all. And each and every one of these guards has gone blind. Many, how many you, oh, we're talking at least 350 years. Record it of people go on blind faith that I go, bitch, you could have that job.

Speaker 3:          01:43:09       Well, they may not have lava and you get this arc of the covenant. Why is it so awesome that it's willing to make you go blind? And that is the exact question. I mean, so something is going on there unless it's a hoax. And, and the stories have been made up to think that man who, uh, told Graham Hancock about it had cataracts, you know, that was the, one of the things that led him to start investigating. But I have heard that too many of the people that have been in the care of this thing had been blocked. So what do they think? They think that it's radioactive and some sort of a way possibly, possibly. I mean, according to what is it supposed to be? Well, according to the ancient astronauts theory that I represent, the Ark of the was nothing else but a container in which an extra terrestrial food dispensing device was stored in food dispensing.

Speaker 3:          01:44:01       Yes, like an extra terrestrial vending machine. Exactly. I like that. I'm going to, I'm going to steal that from you. I liked that very much. So the Ark of the covenant is nothing but a fucking vending machine, but it's a great time. So that basically, how did you come to that conclusion? Look in the 19 seventies, these two engineers then of Rodney Dale and George says they wrote a book called the man and machine and if you look at Mana, Mana, meaning the, the, the, the breadth of that fell from heaven. Exactly. And uh, they ancient astronaut people and the mushroom people need to get together, come up with a unified theory of crazy because that's what they believe. Monetize. I'm sorry. No, don't worry. So there is a, uh, uh, in the Hebrew Zahar than there is a. sorry. In, in the, um, in the Kabbalah, there a text in the Kabbalah called Zahar.

Speaker 3:          01:45:02       And the so hard describes a, an ancient of days that the traveled with a 40 year wanderings through the desert at this ancient of days was with them all the time. At the ancient of days has been interpreted, interpret as the Old Testament God. And so these two engineers came along and theoretic description of it and they said, you know what, this does not sound like a dad at all, but it sounds like some type of a machine. Now mind you, those guys were engineers, electrical engineers, so they weren't some hobbyists or something like this. And one guy was also a linguist at the same time. So they looked at all these translations and look at all the, uh, the different interpretations. And they found that some of the earliest translations of the ancient of days wasn't in fact the ancient of days. But the transportable, one of the tanks now that is very bizarre that you have this thing that had to be disassembled and assembled every week on different, uh, on, on, after a certain amount of time where this machine or this object was taken apart with different parts that were connected with cubes.

Speaker 3:          01:46:18       And there was a huge light source. And it was just this magnificent thing that they determined, dispensed the Mana through big giant tanks. And also through tubes. And things like this, um, that, uh, you know, that is the reason why we have to the Sabbath today because on the sabbath the machine had to be cleaned. So all those differently. This is wild stuff, wild and crazy stuff, but at the same time it's very compelling because the texts are exactly saying that that on Friday and Saturday you're not going to get fed because this quarter and called dad had to be taken apart and cleaned and it wasn't extremely meticulous and dangerous process. People died. People who did not know how to operate or how to conduct themselves in the presence of this transportable off the tanks. They dropped to the floor dead and then they would lose their fingernails.

Speaker 3:          01:47:23       They would have a minute ago, you broke my crazy meter. Broken. My Shit's broken night. It don't work anymore. Good. I don't know what you're saying anymore. I don't even know what you're saying. My job. I have done my job. Try to throw your shit in my brain what you were saying about this machine and then my, my, my, my brain's going, what the fuck are you asking me? Do you think it's possible that there was like this ancient machine that killed everybody? Why would they do that? Was there a shortage of fully back then? Could they just go get food? Maybe the food. They had awesome food. It took an ice cream truck back in the time machine. People would freak the shit with an ice cream cone. The pushy that you would get initially, there are ancient stories where they talk about magical glowing tablets that contained the universe.

Speaker 3:          01:48:18       The universal knowledge was to take. If you take that, those were iphones back to the, you know, 10,000 years ago, you have a magical tablet all of a sudden. Yeah. It is true. Yeah. Well, you know, like I said, I believe that there's some shit that human beings have discovered a long fucking time ago and then rediscovered it if human beings created the pyramids and that is the general consensus. Right, and I agree with that. Definitely human beings, but with the assistance of exit terrestrial technology, because that is what ancient texts, for example, the all had taught, Kita are saying, written by the Egyptian historian on the Chrissy, that the pyramids were built by [inaudible], which was a king and his people with the assistance of the guardians of the sky. And in our interpretation, of course, the guardians of the sky. We're advanced flesh and blood could terrestrials who taught mankind how to use certain machinery Yo [inaudible] Zachariah such and believed that the pyramids were never tunes that were never built as soon as he, he believes that they were beacons for the is.

Speaker 3:          01:49:29       Yes. I mean, that is definitely a possibility personally. Uh, I, I agree with the notion that the pyramids were never tombs because, uh, even when the first time that the pyramids were allegedly the seals were broken, uh, no, no actual bodies were found in there. And what's really fascinating is the fact that, you know, the pyramids defied every single other co structure in Egypt because you walk inside any tomb in Egypt and there the walls are filled with hieroglyphics. And, and really, I mean it says exactly when it was built by whom and how and when and what and where, and you go inside the pyramids and they're completely anonymous except for a couple of cartoons. That debate is still out whether or not these cartoon shows are in fact before juries were not, so that that mystery has not yet been solved. And despite what mainstream archaeologists saying when they've dated the Great Pyramid, back to 2,500 BC, what have they used to data?

Speaker 3:          01:50:34       What is the. Oh, they, they basically, um, see that? I know. I love that you just asked that question because the great misunderstanding is that when there's a lot of people that say, you know, when they dated the Sphinx or when they dated the pyramid and when they, and right there you can, you need to take a step back because nobody was actually able to do that because you can't really date stone because the stone is an inorganic material. If you carbon date something with this, what they call the c 14 or carbon 14 method. With dating, you can only date something that's of a living material like bones or coal or textiles and things like that because what they do is they measure the half life period of radioactive isotopes and so that's how you can accurately date, for example, a, um, you know, an old fire pit that has been found and many times archeologists are dating a firepit and then they come up with a particular lady yields that the test yields a particular date, let's say, uh, you know, 500 BC and then they say, well, okay, that means that the site itself also dates from 500 BC.

Speaker 3:          01:51:53       And that, in my opinion is a logical fallacy because just because a firepit bates to 500 BC doesn't mean that was also built in 500 BC. They can't date stones. Right, exactly. So how do they do good Beckley Tepi, how do they say that? That thing is 12,000 years old with, with, with the fire pits and the bones that were found in and around that area. So it's still absolutely so, which means that the stones themselves could date back even further. It would be way newer APP. Yes, of course. Look Weird. Are they using go Beckley Teppei though for folks I don't know. It's right now considered to be the oldest structure ever discovered and they're saying that it's 6,000 years before Mesopotamian Sumir, which was previously considered to be the cradle of civilization, the oldest. And they're saying that this was all constructed, but I can people were hunter gatherers, but if that is what they're saying, I mean how can you say that if it's just like fire pit shit and bones and whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:52:52       Right. The thing is also that, you know on, on the little Mediterranean island in Malta, which is right next to Sicily, there are megalithic structures. Megalithic meaning gigantic stones that are, you know, 250 500 metric tons heavy slabs that have been transported from somewhere else put into place with incredible precision. And some of these have data to 12,000 BC when allegedly we were just, you know, munching on bananas and how do they date these to 12,000 BC? What are they also again with, with bones and with having found fire pits. But that does not mean that the stones themselves have been placed there even earlier. There is a, uh, a method out there called, called the thermo luminescent, a dating method of stone where, uh, you can conceivably date stone bites. It's a bit inaccurate because what happens is if you Polish or cut a stone, the oxygen in the air, there's a chemical reaction that takes place with the surface of that stone and they can somehow somehow measure this has been cut.

Speaker 3:          01:54:02       Exactly. And, but it's a very expensive way of testing something. So in many universities unfortunately don't have the money. So they don't do that. The third way is we're each time that you have an ancient stone overtime, because we were talking before about erosion and if you have thousands of years of rainfall, what is left over? You gave the answer, you said rocks. And that is exactly right. So over time, what forms over a rock is this thin film that just built, it's called a Patina. And the thicker this film or this Patina is the older the stone. So people have in fact been able to measure the Patina and people have determined that some of these cuts are thousands and thousands of years old, meaning they're not modern day creations and right there it just boggles the mind because it was certainly not cut with blondes. Tools are with chicken bones.

Speaker 3:          01:55:07       As we were led to believe. If you had the opportunity right now, if the government came and they picked you up and air force one and flew to Washington and said, listen to, we're gonna, we're gonna offer you something I didn't know you know a lot about the shit we could use you. We're going to show you some shit and when you needed to help us. But you can't tell anybody. You've got to quit your all your ancient alien stuff. You've got to quit your magazine. You got to work for the government and tell no one. And they monitor your fucking calls. If you telling anybody you're dead, but they're going to take an area 51 and they're going to take you to Wright Patterson air force base to hang 18 and they're going to show you all that shit. Would you be down? They're going to show you the ancient show

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       you everything. You know the answer. Yes. You would do it right? Yeah. You'd give up on civilization and be a suit. Of course. I might be to. I might do it two. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm, I quit comedy. Quit comedy to learn about the aliens because it helped me, you know, if you knew, if you knew for a fact, would it help? Would we just sit around waiting for the ambulance to come? And then when they didn't want you be disappointed. I mean, if you do know that there are aliens out there and they're monitoring you, like, come on, make something happen. Oh, here, here's something I would like to put on the record.

Speaker 3:          01:56:17       Hear that personally, I have never seen a Ufo. I have never been visited. I have never had any, uh, you know, an abduction experience or anything like this. So because a lot of people asked me that and then I tell them, no, actually I haven't been there like, well then how do you subscribe to these ideas? And I'm like, well, because you know, to me this has really nothing to do with belief because belief always has this quote unquote religious connotation. It means that if you believe something, you have to have faith. I don't have faith in aliens, I don't worship them. I don't quote unquote think of them as spiritual or divine beings. There are people like us just more advanced technologically speaking. So to me it's more of an idea of, of knowing instead of believing I think about these things. It's not, you know, that I quote unquote bullying.

Speaker 4:          01:57:11       So you think there's a broad spectrum of aliens out there? Like there's some of them that are just like a little more advanced than us. Like they could visit us and maybe maybe fuck us and gold. Sure. And there's other ones that are like super advanced that are just showing up as clouds and monitoring us and explosions. Is

Speaker 3:          01:57:28       this a thing out there where this guy, Carter chef is Soviet scientist in the sixties and seventies actually came up with this, the classification of civilizations, and he said that there's basically three types of civilizations out there, type one, type two, type three, type one civilization is. And it's all about energy because in the end that's all what it comes down to. And uh, he basically suggested that a type one civilization is capable of harnessing the energy resources of their own home planet. A type two civilization is able to harness the energy resources of their solar system. And a type three civilization is able to harness the energy resources of their own galaxy. Now we on this scale are were none. We are type zero civilization on the verge of becoming a type one civilization. So Sagan, Carl Sagan actually suggested that we're maybe a point seven or possibly now a point eight and many of these astronomers and astrophysicists are suggesting that this transitionary period from a type zero type one is the most difficult and most dangerous one because it does involve the splitting of the atom or monkeys altogether.

Speaker 3:          01:58:54       And monkeys, you know, so I mean this is all, it's all fascinating stuff. Brian Asleep one thing I was going to ask you about before when you studied, they found those little things, they rebuild and upper propellers on them and they were like a plane. I saw the pictures of those, but it also looks like they kind of modified the, uh, the, the wings a little bit to make it actually fly a, what could it have been just easily like a statue of a bird or, or, or something like that. Why is it all just they put routers, it doesn't look like they modified the wings on a, on the actual statute is just like a flat, you know, that has to be curved in order for it to get flight, you know? Yeah. But the thing is that it actually, um, in, in, in the same collection of, of um, the totems or robbed or found.

Speaker 3:          01:59:47       They did find carvings or creations of birds and they look totally different. Yes. And fish and crocodiles and what he was talking about earlier too about the wings being on the bottom and the fuselage. And all that shit is like the rudder on the top. There's no animal in the history of the cars. That fucking thing. Right. Um, let me see some of those pictures you brought him in because he brought in some bad ass structures. And this is a your own collection. Yeah. This is stuff that I, that I took a all around the world now, for example, you know, because I was saying earlier that obviously our ancestors did know how to cut stone and move objects and move stone blocks and things like that. So there's absolutely no question about that. They did know how to do this, but I'm going to show you a physical impossibility right now where I still today, I show these pictures at each and every one of my lectures and I have yet anyone to come forward and tell me how this was done.

Speaker 3:          02:00:47       And I've taught, I've shown these pictures to engineers to stone cutters and things like that. And if they're like, this can't be done. So if you look, for example, at this structure right here, obviously it's a type of a stone quarry. We're blocks were cut out so you know, there's no question that stone blocks where were actually cut out of these particular sections. Right? Right there. However, if you, and this year is on the back entrance in Peru in an area called a orientate tombow and uh, what you have here is a two blocks that were cut out of the side of the mountain, one at the very top where if you look closely at the, uh, at this particular photograph, the top one, the top block or the top slab was released by, you know, having three cards on the left and the right in the bottom.

Speaker 3:          02:01:50       And then one blade that went down on the back. But now I want you to pay attention to the bottom square of this particular, um, slap it was cut out where you can see the four sites have been cut out and then the back. But there is no access point to this particular, uh, to the back. Because if you look closely the bridge that connects or that is between the top part or the top slab that was cut out. And the bottom one, there is no access point, it's a solid piece. And so I see what you're saying. Right? So what you're saying is that the top one you could slide behind it and cut it out because you could get at the top of it. This one, there's like a bridge and as no way to get behind it and write it up. And as if somebody wants to have a good time, the actual block that fit into the bottom slot is sitting right next to it, as we say.

Speaker 3:          02:02:50       Maybe they just destroyed it. No, no, no, no, no, no. You could see it and hear it is cut out. Check it out. So, and that piece right there, that blog has not a single millimeter of loss of material. So it's not like a carved around it or something. I mean this is a physical impossibility. And the only way that somebody, uh, you know, give an idea how this could have been been possible is you have a piece of this is I really wish we had photos of this that we could show people. I mean, this is, um, W can they look up, we're going to look up on the [inaudible]. This is really fascinating. What is the name of this stone and what could they look up online if they want to do with this yet broke? How many people are looking at this at a fraction?

Speaker 3:          02:03:37       I can send you, I can send you the, what should, what should they look for this? This, this is we untaped tombow o l l a n t a y t a, b Oriente. Tom Is in Peru in Peru. And it's a in the backs in the quarry of that archaeological site. It's fucking incredible. Now I got a question. What would the fuck is up with Peru? Man, there's so much crazy shit in Peru with the Nasco lines, Machu Picchu, those crazy people, the skulls with a, uh, the deformed their skulls and make themselves look like fucking the coneheads, the Eland, gator craniums is a cone. Heads is definitely at a, below the same error. Is it all combined? Yes and no. I mean, look, one thing that's really great in my opinion is that the archeologists agree that in Peru has the culture to the culture, the ancient culture of Peru, the Incas, and what's fascinating is the fact that today, the archeologists agree that a pre inca civilization did in fact exist, but not a single archeologist agrees who the hell those pre inca people were.

Speaker 3:          02:04:58       So this is where you know, your previous idea in theory definitely comes into place or fits, that there was a type of highly advanced civilization back in the past that nobody knows even know what date and some have suggested 10, 15,000 years ago that that civilization might have been wiped out because Puma Plinko for example, is such an era of such a region or a site that was 100 percent built by pre buy, buy a pri inconsideration and still today archeologists are fighting over who these people were. We had a buddy on the other day, Thompson had been demonstrably feature several times and I was saying that I had read something, I believe it was Graham Hancock speculation about launch Picchu. That at one point in time it was at the side of water isn't not true. Puma, Puma, Puma. What? It wasn't, wasn't much a pitcher.

Speaker 3:          02:05:52       In fact Puma. Puma is translated. It's but it's miles away from water right now, right? Yes, yes. But it's right next to. It's right next to Lake Titicaca, which is the highest navigable lake in the world at 12 and a half thousand feet and still today, the, the train, the train, the train tracks that drive or to go through with the Bolivian highlands and the proven highlands are filled with muscles and with fish bones that are thousands and thousands of years old proving that that area used to be under seawater. We're not talking, we're not. Yeah, we're not talking, you know, fresh water. We're talking seawater. So I mean, so people were punk who was built as an ocean port. Yes. And that is even something that mainstream archaeologists have proposed as well. And how old is supposed to be then? Well that would mean it goes back to the last ice age.

Speaker 3:          02:06:51       Socially we're at 14,000 years ago. So all these Dasko lines and the top of the Nazca lines isn't there like clear evidence that area has been excavated by machine. I mean there are entire mountain tops at Mrs are missing to have been as if with a cheese knife. But I know that it was higher. I mean what is the proof? Well, because you have a mountain ranges right next door, not even 100 yards away or 200 yards away or a certain height of a certain height and you know, and, and the other ones are completely like, they're like table top level is level 100 percent real affection. Do you play pool on it? Absolutely. Really should go play some NASCAR, Nascar Pool right now. What is the mainstream opinion of what those lines are? Ford's very clear. You could only see them from the sky if they are just artwork their artwork for fucking who fucking exactly how big are they?

Speaker 3:          02:07:50       They are, there is. Nazca is fascinating because you have a world famous geoglyphs and mainly you people see the, the, uh, the images of the spider and the monkey astronaut astronaut, by the way, the astronaut who looks like eat with the big eyes, one hand is pointing to the sky, the other hand is pointing to is both suck my dick. That's sort of space with his dick. Um, and so, uh, you know, but at the same time you have those lines that look like landing trips that look like landing strips. And by the way, we never suggest that that they actually were landing strips because the argument is completely ridiculous because what extraterrestrials traveled millions and billions of light years plan before they can land is to get a build airstrips. It makes no sense. So now, so for the debunkers to even say that they're nuts, what do you think those lines are then?

Speaker 3:          02:08:47       Those long straight lines, they look like, you know, it looks like an airport. There's absolutely no doubt in that that it looks like an airport. But. So for example, look right now we've got a rover on Mars that's, you know, driving around and it's leaving behind these tracks. So we're suggesting that at some point a long time ago, some type of an unmanned or possibly even manned craft landed at Nassco for to conduct a core drills and core samples of the ground to determine what's in that area because still today, NASA is a bunch of drilled holes, right? Yes. And there are you. And there's still mining going on today at Nasa because it's very abundant in a very precious raw materials on earth. So if you want to know about planet earth, you can go to NASA and by conducting a few days of research you, it's like the cliff notes of planet Earth essentially.

Speaker 3:          02:09:47       And so imagine if you had a bunch of natives there and all of a sudden this thing lands that conducts a bunch of research there, of course, afraid they run away. And then this, uh, this craft leaves again and it leaves, it has left behind some tracks in the sand or on the ground. And then they come back out and they look at this stuff and they're like, oh my God, what just happened here? I think we were just visited by God doesn't create these funerary objects that are 1000, 500 years old. It looked like planes that are from central and South America. Doesn't it make more sense that they had planes that someone had planes back then? Well, yes, of course. I mean that is the suggestion that the runways. And that's what this whole multi Nazca lines thing maybe it really isn't an airport.

Speaker 3:          02:10:33       Look, I'm always, I'm always one to say, never say never. So I don't care. Yeah, exactly. Flush and loved ones at that. No, but the thing is that, you know, the bottom line is that at Nassco, what's really odd is that we have done some research there were we found, you know, higher levels of arsenic in areas where there shouldn't be any arsenic and very bizarre magnetic fields there where you can put down your compass and it keeps on spinning and things like that at the beginning and the end of this runway looking like strips. Excuse me. And so something definitely happened there because the whole idea that it was very easy to build these things is nonsense because people have suggested, oh, all you have to do is you have to scratch off the surface of the, off the off the ground, and then you expose the lighter and darker underground with the pebbles and things like that.

Speaker 3:          02:11:31       We've tried that and people have tried. It doesn't work that way. So many things in Peru, it's not just that, oh no. With Machu Picchu and the skulls, those people that were forming their heads, what is the explanation for that? They made their heads or an alien heads. They flatten them out and them out mountain. Well and, and here's the crazy thing that archeology even has an answer to this. And they say that the reason why, and this was achieved by binding the infant's head upon birth with the wooden boards so that the brains or the, the, the skull brain chambers, we would, you know, grow into this elongated fashion. And the archeologists are saying, well, yes, of course they did this because they were mimicking or worshiping their gods. And then they pat each other on the shoulder and then they go home and say, case solved mystery done.

Speaker 3:          02:12:23       We're out of here. This is it. And that is exactly where I say, no, this isn't that where the mystery is not solved because the question is, okay, you just said, but this was done in order to worship the gods. Well, my question is, who were these gods? That is the question that the archeologists are not answering. Are there any images that they have of these gods? These, for example, it all over ancient Egypt, which by the way did the Sgo deformation phenomenon also happened in ancient Egypt. It happened in Germany. It happened in Russia all around the world. Do we have these elongated skulls that are obviously human in origin, but they all have all these elongated heads. And then there are some scholars that we don't know if they're really human in origin. I mean, who knows that star child thing. When you think about that, is that a horseshit that for example? I mean it's definitely something worth looking into. Absolutely. There's no question in my mind, but to return to the Eland, you don't know about star child now. Star child skull, the they found it's really freaky looking. They've determined that it's human, but it

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       might be human plus something else like the mitochondrial Dna, whatever the fuck it was. I think it was determined that the mother was human. They don't know what father was. Yeah. This is just reading it online. It could easily just be some horrible birth defects. It's, it's to be debated, but the thing, it's definitely a fascinating story that you know, merits further investigation out of all these sites. Replaces, haven't you been to? I've been to most of them. Eighty percent of them. Ninety percent of them like. No. I mean I know there's definitely been about to 75 percent of the stuff because see that's the most mind blowing and putting the Puente club. Yeah, I mean look for sheer size, it's definitely the great pyramids on the Giza plateau because have you been. You must go. I met. He's been you. So you know, I've only been to you need, so that's the only place I.

Speaker 4:          02:14:24       that's also crazy thing with the shadow play in all this. I mean, you know, when you stand in front of that pyramid, you're breathless that you can't breathe. They're so incredible. It's crazy about him is that you never see the pyramids and the pictures that you see, you never see that there's like a ghetto and Egypt and get on all around it and you know what I mean? They're just. There's one side of the pyramid where it's all open desert and then right there you're in a ghetto and the cool thing is when you drive around this gallery owner and garbage, but the pyramid is always visible wherever you go. So you've got this ancient monument and then you place. Yes, exactly.

Speaker 4:          02:15:05       Drive bys cheap goat head. What's cool about your job? You have your job is so cool that if there was ever a chick that was like a little bit out of your league, you could always saying it, I'm going to Machu Picchu next week and I want you to go with me. Right? What girl wouldn't doubt will. We were saying that our Thomson girl, if I was a chicken, pretty willing to fuck, I'm just telling me so much about Machu Picchu, men who are trying to deal closer right there. You have good genetics, and we get traveled, man, a man with that kind of experienced sort of a nerd, but damn, that's crazy hair and all of his jewelry. I do want to go to Easter island. Who the Puma, the Nazi symbol built into it. Got One part. I bet he has chicks laying it out. You probably have chicks laying it out on Easter island.

Speaker 4:          02:15:52       You know what I mean? And and along the input, put a swastika was a swastika and put them up there because all around the world, in fact the swastika is, has its origin in ancient India and Hindu and good fortune. Absolutely. Absolutely. So the first telling people that now, first of all, they reversed the reverse that direction, but whatever. I mean, but the bottom line is they're ruined that. And the little mustache, Michael Jordan tried to bring back that a little monster. So that's kind of an ego that motherfucker has. Maybe they reversed it to say, sign of death instead of sign of good fortune or

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       bad fortune gang. They just stole it and it was also used in ancient Greece. I mean, it's not the same. They did reverse it. Yes, yes, absolutely. Symbolism is fascinating, which is one of the most fascinating things to me about the Egyptian language that it was all symbols, but instead of with us with letters and each letter having a sound that what they have is like symbols and he said that apparently just absorbing the language isn't interpreting and just has a completely different experience in the human mind. You know these all these symbols. We have symbols that we re register like this is a McDonald's symbol, this is citgo, this but their language consistent of these things and that is a completely different experience than reading our language and the ancient, the incas had not. They had string. That was their language, their. That was their written language number.

Speaker 3:          02:17:21       Why they got jacked by the Spanish. The Spanish came over and go, Yo, Yo writing string with a shop to giving us a gold. Let's get the gold for that motherfucker on the ship. That is rather because what wants the gold ran out? They started fucking slicing, realizing that they weren't God's anymore till they thought people on horses were gods. Well, there's actually a little bit more to that story and that is that get out. That was, it was toward the end that many Asian cultures based their whole calendar on the return of the gods. And it just so happened that, uh, you know, both Cortez and Pittsboro happened to arrive on the shores in the same year. Fucking lucked out is it? Absolutely is, was complete chance and need the beard at the serpent. The plume serpent doesn't that same thing mean a bearded man isn't there like a, the, the translation of Queso and Kukula con is like, like so similar to a man with a beard and that, you know, this is one of the reasons why the Aztecs were so baffled by these people really are men with beards.

Speaker 3:          02:18:38       Yeah, yeah. Yes. I mean, that's, that's part of it, but to me that's kind of, it's very elitist in, in a certain way because even though those, those theories have been proposed that you know, and all of a sudden a, this redheaded guy appeared with a red beard and things like that, then that's why he was worshiped. I mean, I, I don't think that people are or that, you know, the, those coaches back then were so shallow. I think it has more to do that this quits bottler coopered con character. If he was a redhead, a guy that he flew around in this flute flying or plumed or winged serpent and that this winged serpent, we all know that snakes do not fly and so you need enough mushrooms. They do, Bro. I can talk to you and see. Here's the thing that you can't attribute everything that a person sees to mushrooms, mushrooms, because you've done enough mushrooms.

Speaker 3:          02:19:38       You can. Yes. Not. Look, I have to say something about yes. No, but the thing is that our collective through our collective consciousness today is way bigger than the collective consciousness. Back in the day. How do we know? Well, because today if yes, no, I mean the thing is that you know today, if we see if we see a spaceship or a Ufo, we can immediately recognize it as a spaceship or a Ufo. Back in the day, if you didn't know what that was, it doesn't matter how many mushrooms you took, you still have to describe it with something that was a spark of inspiration or a spark of something that, that motivated or inspired all these stories. So yes, but how do we not know that what these stories are is people's memory of someone else who had seen people who were flying around and it was thousands and thousands of years ago over time, but that's the story.

Speaker 3:          02:20:37       More and more diluted. Well, it goes back to heal and they and they absolutely did. They did get diluted. That's the whole. That's the whole idea that, you know, that's why we have, you know, Christianity today and Islam and all those different things. I believe you believe these depiction of humanity, that we were engineered from a lower primates by some aliens to mine for gold. I subscribe to the sort of first, uh, as a part of that statement, yes, that, that we came about through a direct targeted mutation of our genes and that that will be the ultimate proof by the way, the ultimate proof of visitation, willing to be in a crash spaceship or a finding a ray gun or something silly like that, but it'll be an hour. It will be found in our own genes that something happened in the past that did not come by chance, but haven't they already mapped out the human genome is not how they understand like the people, white people mostly related to neanderthals and they've definitely figured out all these things.

Speaker 3:          02:21:42       Yes, of course. I mean there's definitely many, many conclusions have been drawn, but there's still some mystery in the human genome. Absolutely. For example, that, you know, 95 percent of our human genome, of our DNA makeup allegedly is junk. I, I completely disagree with that. Just because we can't decipher those 95 percent yet doesn't mean that that 95 percent truly is garbage. I think that in our lifetime and things are going to change quickly though, and no, we were not create a slaves. No, absolutely don't believe that's again and glue nonsense. So they came and they just sort of fucked with people and created what we will do 5,000 years from now on another planet. You know, if, if we want to experiment and I think that, you know, good in the end always outweighs the bad talk to the Indians. They got checked well, but seriously that, you know, you can definitely make an argument that if we go out there that it won't be to destroy others, but you know, in a benevolent way in

Speaker 4:          02:22:55       planet earth, every single intelligent animal that's less intelligent than us. We've been slaved. We fucked with dolphins, Orca as monkeys, chimps, everything that we can fuck me, fuck everything that we can eat. We eat. And that is the evidence of every other intelligent life. How it treats that other intelligent life that it can manipulate like dolphins killing other dolphins and orcas killing dolphins,

Speaker 3:          02:23:18       orchids killing whales. But I also think that that is why that is the reason why we have not yet made official contact with any type. So we're not ready. We're not.

Speaker 4:          02:23:28       You fucked too many animals. I wonder what are the top, the top five animals that we fuck as I would say sheep number one donkeys. That Colombian donkey show you ever watch that chicken flock of chickens. Dogs. People fucked her dogs for sure. Then the Dave Chappelle bit about. Try to fuck him. Fuck him. Fuck him. Mcgee Mcgee. It'll take off like a piece of celery and throw it in the tall grass. So in closing, this isn't going crazy at the top five right there. Took us 20 fucking seconds. It's not hard. Jellyfish. There was someone really crazy seated. Enemy's enemy frog second pocket flashlight. Yeah, for chimps, right?

Speaker 4:          02:24:24       Tranquilizer. I met through the front lines and just to get off track. I see that guy, that congressman, they got busted. He's a furry apparently has been doing a lot of weird shit. He's kind of tiger costume. Congressman Lou, his, his staff's trying to get him to resign. I don't know if he's resigned yet. It's, it's inevitable, but he's a. apparently he's out of his fucking mind dressing up like a tiger. It's like one of those kids costumes. Not even a cool cut tiger constantly. Well, that's what the firies were. You know, we've talked about furries in the podcast before because I was in Pittsburgh and they had a furry convention at the same time that the UFC was in Pittsburgh and all these firies were wandering the streets and the people in the hotel sent me hip to furries because they go to Pittsburgh every year.

Speaker 4:          02:25:07       So the, uh, the guys that are working in the hotel tell you the nutty stories, these people shitting and litter boxes and some of the furry community actually got upset with me that I was spreading misinformation. Well, I say no, you may not. If you're a furry, you may not be into the dirty aspect of the furry, but there's a broad spectrum of furry behavior folks. And just because you're not into taking shits in letter boxes, it doesn't mean that the man who worked the West and didn't tell me that they called down and asked to put a large litter box in the lobby of the western because the firies had every room in the western. So they wanted a litter box. One, one litter box for everyone. Yeah. The Guy who, uh, I asked the guy who was delivering the food and the room service guy, he said that they asked for bose like the feet on the ground, like d, like dog bowls, like big bowls and what? All their food in bowls. And then they go over there. The bowls are on the ground, like bowls of milk, fast for large bulk. They eat like an animal. And this dude's a congressmen. There's, we're, we're so up the ass of politicians that there's no one left but crazy people. There's no one left. But Michele Bachmann's, you've got to be completely had to fucking lunch to want to be the president of this country.

Speaker 4:          02:26:14       Coming from the alien guy that's saying a lot Thursday, ancient aliens. The premier of season three. Good luck with that, sir. Thank you very much for coming on the podcast and if you want to follow Giorgio on twitter, it's sucralose. T S O u k a l a l l o s o s. I'm going to say it again.

You got sick. I got sick last weekend so I rescheduled it for this Saturday at 10:00 at j. j.com. And get on the forum. That's the name of my phone. 10th 10th clowns. Jujitsu. We love it. That's great man. We named it. Well now you're a high talking about Zechariah Bureau judo, Jujitsu and then it sounded too weird.

Speaker 4:          02:27:14       Junk on the planet. I'm not stupid. Two minutes later I thought, damn, that sound way better than me, so I named my beer then be really for them. That's where all the information you Jitsu history bitches. August 13th, August 13th, I will be in Milwaukee With Mad Flavor, Aka Joey Diaz at the PAPP's theater. Tickets are still available.

And um, it's only been on sale for a couple of days. Denver showing mad love. Can't wait to get back to Colorado before the end of the earth for the civilization corrodes. And that's where I live. I turned away because I'm going to travel through space. Speed of light. Come back 13,000 years. There's a lot of shit that happened in this podcast and not a lot of.

Speaker 4:          02:28:10       It was good. A lot of it was strange. Brian fell asleep at least five times. I noticed it. Eddie Bravo. I'm just drunk off it. Any questions before we leave for this? Man? You were fucking chomping at the bit to get in here on this podcast. I was just, I want her to sit and listen to him talk. I know we got into dirty shit at the end, so I feel like he corrupted enough. We did. We did enough damage to Zam. Beautiful. Alright. Thank you everybody. Thanks for tuning in. That's it for this week. We'll be back next week. We're trying to rub it together with Jay Moore. He was busy this week and next week probably Joe Diaz and Duncan trussell. We'll see you soon.
