Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. Uh, Wyclef Jean who just robbed half a fucking Haiti dot cock sucker. That's why I'm Haiti. You to see that he robbed us all. Fucking earthquake relief. Fun. No, that million dollars brow. That's why I'm saying unless I see the guy on the street bleeding, I give them money. When you sent her flowers, they get 30 of it. Did you steal my change jar in the late nineties probably fucking change jar. What's a change jar? Is this the head? Oh, if blue just talking about Robert. Yeah, he was just thinking about the nineties and we where we lived on curse on and there was a fucking change. Our Ego that probably is fucking, I called you Joey jingles for awhile. No, no. I would never write change. I know that it was someone who just fucking change. Just like a fucking cup of cheese. Yeah. It was just a weird thought at this point in my ankle, I smoked pot, which I never do.

Speaker 1:          01:03          A fuck is wrong with y'all. I'm a professional. Yeah. Now I remember calling Seattle one time. I was opening up for a stay at home and I picked him up in an Rv. It was snowing in Seattle. I know weird chick was her puppy Carroll, the white stuff. The fucking a little before Perez. He was around for that. He knew all about that shit. See how Joe Rogan, you could go crazy. You got a chick that's sucking your Dick. I've got no experience with this cocaine. I don't, I don't have any experience. We have a fucking shady job. Jesus.

Speaker 1:          01:43          No, no, no. I just noticed the fucking, all the chains had been taken out and nothing else was stolen. I go, who would do that? And I go, I think Joey's back on drugs. Maybe you fucking so I called Joe Doe. It's impossible. Joe, you might've done it. Forgot about it. I think the last time I went to Stan hope sounds like someone like I had an open house policy. He had an open house policy. Still do. I'm like, who would just like, I was just going, this is the fucking like 1996 we were all broke. I'm going, which one of my friends would be broken enough to just fucking, I have a thought of you. I was at the coach and horses tangles out of my fucking mind and I couldn't walk to, uh, Vista. So I went to [inaudible] because he had the open door policy and I go to stay at hopes, I hope with the go.

Speaker 1:          02:27          He's got the bunk beds I get on. But no, at this time it was the living room. He just had a cut. I get on the car cause I couldn't even make it to the fucking bed tonight there's an earthquake and I wake up to the house and they opened my eyes sideways and I see the clock. So I'm focusing on the clock, but the fucking earth is moving, you know what I'm saying? And that was just, that's I think the last time I was. Do you still have that apartment? It's subsidized rent control. I still live there all the time. I still beat the horn when I go by like a motherfucker Hennigan's now just kinda give him town. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you ever Miss La?

I never do that. Just fly somewhere for a vacation. I had my passport in Costa Rica. If I'm going to extend my stay here, did fucking hang out with you. I'll probably be fucked up when I leave. Why not? And then just the thought of lax fucking ruined that entire fantasy. Really? Oh, sorry. He's going to talk down here. No, it was perfect. All right, that's fine. Well, my audio functions are way fucked. Oh yeah, I'm medicinally. You know what I'm, why did you move there in the first place?

Cause you're in like a town of like what? 6,000 people or something crazy. Yeah. Jake Lamata has come over to the house a couple times. Jake Lamata the fighter. Yeah. Really? Yeah. The Guy who they made the movie regional bullet about. Yeah. What's that guy like? Uh, you know what? I could do a fucking 20 minute bit. That's the downside. Like he, he lives there. Yeah, yeah. No, but you have to be respectful of people there because like any good story that comes out of there, of course your neighbor. That's the downside of living in a small town. Yeah. You can't talk about camp. Flip someone off half the fucking stop sign because they cut you off. Cause that guy will be behind you in line it fucking safe safely. Yeah. Like how often you run into the same people over and over again? All the time. All the time. Yeah. That's a weird thing, huh? I go, yeah.
