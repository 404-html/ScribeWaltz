Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Four, three, two, one. What's up ma? What's up buddy? Good to see you, man. It's good to see you. I'm glad we decided to get together and do this, you know, and talk and um, you know, it's all crazy subject, right? I mean you and I have known each other for since 2012 when I did meet eater. You were there filming when I shot my first deer, which is very important part of my life man. And then you went on to direct and produce parts unknown with our late friend Anthony Bourdain and we started probably be a good thing to come in here and just talk. Talk about them.

Speaker 2:          00:00:44       Yeah man. And uh, and I'm really grateful for it, you know, it's actually, you know, a lot of people have been saying to me like, oh, it must be really hard to talk about that. It must really, it's. I actually find it kind of the opposite. Like I want to talk about him. I want to talk about who he was and what that experience was, you know. So, um, thanks ma'am.

Speaker 1:          00:01:05       My pleasure brother. Did you, did you know him before you guys started working together?

Speaker 2:          00:01:10       No, no. I met Tony a 10 years ago and I was called in. He had a DP on a show who at the last minute canceled, couldn't go to Egypt. So, uh, I got a call like a week before, you know, it's like, do you want to go to Egypt with Anthony Bourdain was like, you're fucking absolutely. Um, and uh, and so I met him in Cairo, man, like kind of like perfect. Yeah. Holy Shit. That's like Indiana Jones. Exactly. Man episode when you guys ate a camel. No, no, we didn't need a camel. No, but, um, you know, uh, I met him there, you know, we start filming, we're on the streets of Cairo and like, you know, like all of a sudden is thrown into these kitchens. We were eating pigeon, you know, it's like go in, cover them cooking pigeon. And I'd seen the show like maybe once before, but I knew who he was and I knew what that adventure was, you know, and I was so amped for it.

Speaker 2:          00:02:10       Um, and then there was this seminal moment on that show where we go out and we'd go ripping across the desert with the Bedouin and go out and cook a goat, a in the ground, you know. Um, and so as we're driving out over the desert, we're like, well, we need to, we need some shots from car to car. Right. And I was like, Oh, get on the roof, you know, and uh, and there's like this for, for some reason there's a four post bed tied to the roof of this land rover. And so I get up there and kind of like, you know, latch my arm around it and these guys take off at I, I swear, 80 miles an hour across the desert and you're on a bed. Absolutely, absolutely no regard for the fact that like, I'm on the roof, you know, I'm shooting. And, and when we got there we got to camp. I survived it. I'm at this big black and blue where I was holding onto the four post bed and I go over and I show Tony and um, that was it man. From that moment on, he was like, I liked this guy and I started going out with him, you know, I started getting invited to do more shows. So that was good. How many years? Ten years. Wow. Ten years. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:26       That's crazy. I didn't realize that parts unknown was even an oil. Well, you doing no reservations.

Speaker 2:          00:03:31       Yeah. So that was a no reservation show and then we went to parts unknown five years ago. Wow. Yeah. So parts of one has been on for five years and that uh, you know, that transition. No, no reservation was great and it really laid the foundation for what we do and what Tony did. I think it really built an audience and a following for him and that's where I found out about it. Right, exactly. It was a great show, you know? Um, but that, like that transition going on to CNN, going into parts unknown, that really, that really changed things have really opened up a lot of locations and stuff that we didn't have access to before. It opened up, you know, kind of CNNS logistics, a Rolodex and you know, things that we didn't have at the other network, you know. And uh, and so that's, you know, no reservations was awesome. We did some incredible shows. Parts unknown is where it got really fun.

Speaker 1:          00:04:29       Yeah. That was on another level. I remember watching the chains. I'm like, okay, this is more more him, you know, to everything from the opening music to the tone of it and the narration.

Speaker 2:          00:04:40       Yeah, for sure. And then in, you know, you've got to hand it to CNN to is like all of a sudden we had these creative partners who were like willing to let him be him, you know, like willing to let him do a show like the Tokyo show. We're like, you know, really climbing into Japanese subculture is rope bondage, tentacle porn, you know, all this stuff that most network executives, they're probably a little bit leery of. CNN was Kinda like, you know, go for it man. Be Yourself, you know, and let's figure out what this is together. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:05:13       that's amazing. That really is amazing. And with one of the things that really made that show was Tony's narration because the narration gave you a sense of the way his, his sort of passionate enthusiasm for the world and for various aspects of cooking and travel and food and culture. Like you got it through his own words, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:05:33       Yeah. I think that's, I mean maybe in some ways the most important aspect of the show. Uh, you know, I mean he is after all a writer, right? Yeah. You know, and I'm in that is how he experienced the world. Um, but actually making the shows and the technical part of actually making the shows, you know, we'd once you go through and kind of edit the and you know, none of that voiceover was in at the rough cut phase and then you send it out to him and get his writing back and record that. Vo and I keep describing it is like that kind of Dr. Frankenstein lightening bolt to the temples kind of moment where like the monster rises, it would really bring the show to life. So this kinda carcass that was laid out in rough cut form on the table, all of a sudden just gasped and jumped up and, you know, it was really beautiful to see that and to have, you know, as a director, as a producer, as a creative, you know, at any level, you know, to have that kind of power to have his voice and his writing and his introspection and thoughts and you know, um, that would have like powerful, powerful force to work with.

Speaker 1:          00:06:48       Well, it was a brilliant design. The way the show is put together, that narration really did make it something special and different from all those other kinds of shows because it just his articulate and insightful and poetic and artistic view of these things that he had this infectious passion for things. He completely changed the way I thought about cooking. I had always thought about cooking as, oh, this guy knows how to make delicious food. Oh, this place has good ribs is. And then when I saw his show, when I saw parts unknown, I went, oh, it's an art form. It's just an art form that you eat. Absolutely contemporary art form.

Speaker 2:          00:07:27       Yeah, and even beyond that, it's an art form that's in that taking and incorporating all of these greater kind of macro social elements of, you know, where you are, the history of where you are, you know, what people did for a living, what people's ancestors did for a living, you know, it. Um, it's rooted in so much more than what I think, you know, you know, ultimately it feels like we kind of joke around a lot and say like, yeah, it's the food shows, not a food show, you know, but the reason that worked I think is because of what you're saying and you know, the food food is an art form that incorporates all of these other aspects. And so it can be a jumping point off for exploration into anything you want to talk about. I'm to talk to about the history of a place, the politics of a place, you know, uh, the religion of a place, you know, all of these things that inform who people are. Well that's all written into the cuisine of a place or an area.

Speaker 1:          00:08:25       Yeah. And, and he was into stuff that wasn't necessarily even like high, you know, high dollar items. He was into like street food. Definitely. Yeah. It wasn't just the finest French know trolls where these celebrated world famous chefs were cooking these bizarre small plate sort of masterpieces. No, he would love street tacos.

Speaker 2:          00:08:51       Yeah, absolutely. I mean, again, I think that kind of like a whole new fresh take on looking at food, you know, it's like, it's easy to, you know, to look at these kind of high end French preparations is highly talented, highly trained French chefs. Um, and there's, there's tremendous beauty in that and all of those other things we've talked about. But to look at the woman on the corner, you know, the making, uh, you know, the best, you know, Lingua Tacos, that was revolutionary. And then the realization that all of that, all of that greatness, all of that nuance, all of that flavor, you know, um, contained right within there, that was an access point to it as well. It's just an access point that everyone can afford that everyone can go and, and uh, you know, I mean, right place at the right time. I think that people like, it seems like the culture at large was ready for that, ready for that, like experience in food and ready to kind of chase that because now that's, that's all anyone wants now.

Speaker 1:          00:09:59       Well, I think it's because of him. I really do. I really do because I'm sure that he changed the way I look at things for terms of food and I think he had that effect on many people may think about how many years was known for five and then no reservations for nine new reservations. Yeah, for about 10. And then there was a cook's tour before that, so original all told a decade and a half of his influence on people's food choices and just appreciation for food. I mean, I know personally I've had some great meals in restaurants, but some of my favorite meals had been like stepping outside of a bar, you know, it's 1:30, you got a little buzz on and some dudes got a Taco truck and like, oh baby, what do you got over there? And my friend or in New York, you know, it's late at night and there's a falafel cart. And some guys got a incredible kabobs. Like, oh, something about street food man.

Speaker 2:          00:10:51       Absolutely man. And yeah, I kinda keep like a, like a loose running list of my favorite meals, you know, and um, and some of them are on the show and some of them are not on the show. And I'd say most of them are that, you know, most of them are accidentally stumbling into someplace where someone's doing something completely awesome that isn't, you know, some massive 26 course tasting menu. Um, and I think it's also about, you know, it's about place, you know, it's about where you are, the context of where you're getting, what it smells like, what it sounds like, what it looks like, you know. Um, who you're with, you know, and uh, and so, you know, that's Kinda, I think another reason to show kind of worked is we had an opportunity to architect or articulate all of those, all of those elements, you know, are able to choose an incredibly interesting guests to sit down with it, a really interesting restaurant with, you know, cooking over

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       a really interesting backstory in a beautiful place and uh, and then use the power of kind of the magic of TV to, you know, to Polish it up and present this version of travel and food in the world that, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:12:08       really everywhere too. I mean, you guys covered Asia, you covered Europe, you covered some weird places in the south where people are cooking pigs in their backyard. I mean, it was just, it, it gave people an understanding of the preparation of food and a view to chefs and this view of chefs as artists. I mean these chefs look like tattoo artists. They look like, you know, guys who are painters or something, or women who are sculptors. I mean, they're, they're real similar in the way they, they appear to what we consider artists.

Speaker 3:          00:12:40       Yeah, absolutely. And I, and I think too, I mean, I, you know, what I kind of love about like, you know, at this point, spent a good amount of time in kitchens and good around Mount of time around kitchen staff is there's kind of two elements coming together. There's, there's the, the artistic element that you're talking about, right? But there's also this very, you know, very earnest working class kind of element to the way a kitchen works, you know, it was tough, hard, sweaty work, you know, it's a rough environment, you know, and I, and I think that's kind of part of what makes it so appealing to us. He kind of pulled back the curtain on, on that, you know, let's say like these guys are, you know, these guys are not these inaccessible icons though. Paul bocuse of the world, you know, they are um, as much as Paul bocuse is awesome, you know, they are these kind of rough and tumble, you know, guys that are back there making something really awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:13:43       Tony also had this sort of punk rock sensibility to it all to you know, mean that was part of the thing about him that people found appealing is that they had seen cooking shows before, but they never saw cooking shows where the host gets fucked up.

Speaker 3:          00:13:57       No, dude, I was first time I partnered with him, I'm like, this guy goes so hard. I was amazing. Told me about it. It was amazing. I was like, I can't believe he can do this all the time. Like I think one of them

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       first times we ever got hung out together was in Montreal. We were there for UFC fights and we went out afterwards and got. We had some steaks and it was just amazing walking into this restaurant and people freaking out. One guy actually had a copy of kitchen confidential in the actual kitchen itself and had tony sign it. It was pretty fun. A fucking

Speaker 3:          00:14:29       bad ass. Where'd you go? You do not remember Joe Beef? No, it wasn't, but he turned me on a job and eaten there several times since then. Those guys are coming on the podcast to fred and Dave now. They're fucking amazing. That restaurant is one of my favorite restaurants on the planet. No doubt they'll hurt you. They keep it coming for sure. Give you an inch thick slab

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       of flog raw. Yes. Well

Speaker 1:          00:14:54       show. One of the ones that I really loved was the one where they did ice fishing there were on the water and they had this ice fishing shack, but inside the ice fishing shack they had find silverware and find China and they had bottles of really excellent wine and they were cooking on a wood stove. They had a wood stove and they were cooking fog while right, right there on the stove and then they were laying out what they think makes you a good dinner companion. And David's like, I shut my phone off. I turned it off. I put it away and he goes, I don't check it, don't. He goes, I don't put my elbows on the table, you know? And he's like, can I come prepared with stories? And Tony was like, you prepare your stories. I have stories to tell. I come prepared like to him it's like not really a performance, but it's an agreement that you're going to, you're going to go there and you're going to share this enthusiasm for this experience together and you're going to try to enhance it with your own anecdotes and personality and your own appreciation for the food and the wine and then afterwards they're smoking Cuban cigars.

Speaker 1:          00:16:02       It was like the whole things it made you want to go eat at a really good place.

Speaker 2:          00:16:07       Yeah. Or in a, in a, in a shack on a frozen lake with, with people who understand that there's an elegance to all of these things, you know, that you can create an environment that, that has an elegance. And that's, you know, I'd say that's like a hallmark of a lot of the chefs that I've met through the show is like, you will see that no matter how big they get, no matter how successful there is an inherent kind of desire to please on multiple levels. You know, you'll have, like I remember we were in a Daniel Boulud's house in France or did his parents house. Right? And so he, Daniel Ballou like the mega chef, you know, um, but like running around to all of the crew members, like you have something to eat, are you good? Do you want another glass of wine? Do you want to look, you know, and it just inherited his nature is exactly what you're talking about.

Speaker 2:          00:16:59       This idea that, you know, they have this just ongoing desire to please their guests, to entertain, to, you know, make sure that everyone's taken care of the curators, have an experience. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. You know. And so to be able to, you know, run around the world for 10 years and explore. That was nice man. Man. I can only imagine. I can only imagine. How many shows did you guys film together? I don't, you know, I dunno. Fifty seven or 60, something like that. Somewhere in La. Yeah. Wow. So I mean listen, there are people, you know, at 10 years on the show, I was on the show for a long time. There's people lot longer. There's people that did the whole 17 years. People have done well over $100, you know, no one left that

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       show. You don't leave that show if you get a spot on it. Were you with him when, when it ended? No. Uh, no. I was with him, um, about a week and a half before. Uh, so now I had good friends that were there. I was in Chicago and uh, I've woke up and checked my phone and I got a text from my friend Maynard Maynard Keenan from tool and um, maynard is a Jujitsu brown belt and really loves Jujitsu. Any, any, um, texted me. He said so much for the uh, maynard versus Anthony Bordain celebrity Jujitsu match and that's the whole text and um, you know, just sunk, sunk a pit in my stomach and I just picked up my phone. I went into Google and I looked it up and I saw it. I'm just like, oh fuck. I just couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it.

Speaker 4:          00:19:02       No.

Speaker 1:          00:19:05       Started crying I think. I think I called my wife. They're called maynard. I texted him, I called my wife, called a few friends,

Speaker 4:          00:19:19       you know, just like,

Speaker 1:          00:19:23       you know, just couldn't believe, you know, when someone's just not there anymore. I didn't get to see him a lot, but I was just, uh, just appreciated the fuck out of that dude, you know, like, I don't want to do anybody's TV show, but when I got a call from him I was like, fuck yeah, what are we going to do? We're gonna shoot pheasants and, and hunt and camp and we're going to cook by the campfire. Fuck them in, dude, you know, I'm in. I just really appreciated him as a genuine, unique person. Like is it genuine, rare person? And uh, you know, that's, that's what I got out of being.

Speaker 1:          00:20:06       Being able to spend some time with him and being able to talk to him and pick his brain. And he did my podcast once and we always planned on doing it again, which we never got around to it because we're both have ridiculous schedules. But just my, I would think about things differently because of him. Like my eye. I would sometimes hold things to his standards and he me like legitimately is appreciation for things and his enthusiasm for things changed the way I look at a lot, a lot of aspects of food and culture and, and, and even travel, you know. Yeah. I mean I'm,

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       I'm sorry ma'am. I and I, and I know he thought very highly of you and that was that experience in Montana was fantastic, man. So fun. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:20:57       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20:58       You know, it's been, it's been a rough three months and it's still hard for me to really contextualize it and put it together. It feels like, you know, upside down world, like there's no. And he was such a, I mean it was a friend and a collaborator, you know, but also just such an icon to me, you know. Um, and uh, did, it's almost like, you know, it's almost like the sun disappears, you know, or something. It's something that is so just inherently part of life they're in and dependable and you know. Um, so yeah, I mean that's been all right. It's hard to describe how, how profound that span.

Speaker 1:          00:21:48       I remember when he got into Jujitsu, I got psyched because I'm like, we got more to talk about now I can actually, I can actually show them shit, you know, he was always asking about things, you know, he's really good at things. Remember when we were in Montana, we were rolling around on the dirt shoulder stuff. Him and Josh was like, like, when you're in here, like here's what you can do, you can get. And he's like, oh yeah. He's like, he was so a wide eyed, you know, I think it was before he even got his blue belt or maybe it was like around blue belt. So he was super, super jacked about it and he was doing it every day. I remember when we were, we were filming, we were outside of billings. Is that where we were? Where were we? Yeah, well we're, the hunt was the hunt. We were in like

Speaker 2:          00:22:30       go up in central Montana, you know. So, um, we kind of started in billings, but we headed up towards central Montana.

Speaker 1:          00:22:37       He was training so often and even on the road that he traveled to a club, there was just a Jujitsu club and Bozeman. Yeah, and he found some guys and he was rolling with these guys in Bozeman. Definitely like, damn, you're doing it every day because that was a day for a long time on the show. That was a mandate and we find the local, you know, the local clubs and make sure that he had a place or role texted me from some European bloc country. Said he was shitting bone bone chips as a. He worked out with some old school Carlson Gracie guys. They don't believe in rolling light. It's all top game and smashing you shitting bone chips, but I just, I admired that a guy could be 58 years old and decide I'm going to learn Jujitsu and I'm going to be obsessed with it. And then he became addicted to it. Which, you know, Jujitsu is a very beneficial thing to be addicted to, but it is absolutely an addiction. I've, I've come back from injuries were. I definitely shouldn't have been training yet and I just wrapped my arm up and just fucking get in there. People get super, super addicted to it and he got addicted to it. Just like he's been addicted to many things. He, he jumped right into the Jujitsu, Jujitsu experience.

Speaker 2:          00:23:43       Yeah, man, I'm,

Speaker 3:          00:23:47       I'm glad he did. It wasn't me. Anyway, it was clearly like really good for him to us. I mean, I know very little about Jujitsu. I know what I know from Tony, you know, slim. Yeah. He lost all that weight. All of a sudden you had to stop spacs up smoking, you know, those were, those were big things, man. And uh, and he looked great and he, you know, he got off statens. You're no longer on any sort of medication. He lost all that weight to cut all the carbs out. It was just eating like crazy man. He looked so good. He did look good. Um, he did look good and also just, I, you know, the whole thing was kind of indicative of the way he. I mean, he did things so passionately, you know, whether it was travel the world and soaking up all these experiences or Jujitsu or whatever he was into something.

Speaker 3:          00:24:38       If something caught his attention, he was just so aggressive about knowledge, learning what he could, pulling everything out of it that, that he could, you know, it was crazy to see someone do something that's that physically demanding 58 with no background in athletics at all. Yeah, like you could see when he was like, even when he was doing things, like when he went to curt oce anders place and was rolling around, like he doesn't have a background in that, but he's just pushing himself to it. Yeah. Yeah. And again, I think that was true with everything, you know, I mean if he, if it was something that was interesting to him, he just went, you know, he loved it, man. It was crazy. And I said, you know, I remember texting him going like, how deep you getting into it? He goes, real fucking deep end.

Speaker 3:          00:25:22       He goes, he goes, he goes, I'm getting tapped out everyday. But he goes, I'm giving guys half my age of real struggle, and he goes, uh, and I'm loving it. Yeah. And he talked about that a lot. I mean, I think he talked about like the, the failure as much as anything else. I love that going in and, you know, getting smashed. Yeah. It, you know, again, to his credit, you know, show up in these places, you know, Bozeman, Montana, man or, or butte. You know what I mean? I think he rolled in Butte butte a hard hit and town, man, listen, I love beauty. I love you too much respect to anyone from butte. But man, that's a hard hit in town. You know, you'd roll into real cowboys, you know, and uh, and get the shit kicked out of him and show up on set all you know, sore and bruised and oh man, oh no.

Speaker 3:          00:26:13       And then just jump into that. Know it's just different for a guy who's 58. I mean you got a guy who does it at 20. I admire anybody who does Jujitsu because it's a real humbling ego dissolving experience and a lot of ways because she's makes you realize like all your illusions of how well you can defend yourself. They go out the window and some just chokes you easily and you're like, oh great. I'm just a pitch. Wandered around running around this life thinking I'm a man. But the fact that he did it at 58 just showed what kind of a unusual duty was. Yeah. But what you just talked about there. I mean, what you're talking about with like the ego diminishing aspect of it. Again, I think that that was something that he took great pleasure in and I think that, you know, if you look at the way he went through the world, I'm one of the things that, you know, I appreciate it right off the bat.

Speaker 3:          00:26:59       And one of the things that kept me around as long as I stayed around, you know, um, it was the fact that it took for Tony. I think that he was constantly trying to dismantle that persona. You know, to say like, I'm, I'm not the focal point of this scene, what I'm the, what we're interested in here, what I'm interested in talking about is out there. That's the camera's pointed away from me. You know, he was kind of a clearinghouse for all that information and he was the root of the show and it was his journey. But, you know, ultimately, you know, what was refreshing is he wasn't like working with some celebrity or hosts that was completely consumed by their own ego and their own, you know, brandon and how they were presented to the world. That's so disgusting, right. You know? Yeah, Dude.

Speaker 3:          00:27:49       But it's, it's everywhere. It's everywhere. Yeah. He was very self deprecating and, and he had reverence for real artists and real masters and that reverence came across cross. I texted him about some guy, there was a photo of a restaurant and uh, I'm sure it's still on my phone, subdued, who's like a real famous guy who's like some big time chef character and I was eating in this restaurant. And so I'm like, who the fuck is this guy? I guess it seems like it's a big deal. And so, uh, I uh, I texted him the photo. This cat right here. Yeah. Do you guys was that guy's name? So I said, who is, that guy says Marco Pierre White Made Ramsey cry like a bitch all the time. Original rockstar chef genius madman the original punk. But that kind of text, like that's, that's a Tony Bourdain texts. Um, and that's, that's what that, that text shows that reverence for the master.

Speaker 3:          00:28:48       Oh yeah. You know, I mean even the way he phrases it, you know, made him cry like a bitch all the time. Original rockstar chef genius madman know. And um, and, and that's the way it was. What worked about that is he had a, like an instant ability to sniff through the bullshit, you know, so, you know, listen, there's all kinds of famous people, celebrities and well accomplished people that he met that he didn't feel that way. Not, you know, he would cut through that shit instantly, but if you were on his radar in that way, you know, it's like total commitment to what you do. You're in or you're out there. You Got Anthony Bourdain. Exactly. Do you want to be in that list of people is like, that's a cool list of. Yeah. Well I just remember hanging out with them, you know, like I just, it was one of those

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       guys. He was one of the ones that I met that I was like pretty starstruck. Like right away. Yeah. I said something really stupid, like my wife says you're my boyfriend because they watched actually show all the time. She would just joke around how you want your boyfriend on TV. Like great. Skype is great, but I'm like, uh, when we were in Montana, that's when I really. Well I always knew how hard he went, but when I was blasted out of my mind and he was like, where's that bottle? Where's those joints? And those like Jesus man. Like I can't even. I'm hanging onto the earth here.

Speaker 2:          00:30:14       Yeah. It was a late night. Yeah, it was that one. I mean, listen, they're like, in all fairness, not every night was quite like that, you know? We had a lot of fun that night for sure. It was real fun and in a really

Speaker 1:          00:30:26       interesting, thoughtful dialogue around the campfire with super townie from backwoods country hunters and anglers and all these other guys that were with us or you know, these guys who it was good to get a different perspective on what going out and getting your own wild food is like, you know, and then having him cook it there.

Speaker 2:          00:30:46       It was delicious. Yeah. It was awesome. And, but also being able to put those ideas on like a major network and print. Pretty rare. Yeah. Kudos to CNN for having the Kahunas to put together that kind of a show and have it on, you know, big time man. What can I say? This is the best creative partners you could ask for in terms of that, you know, you really enjoyed that. Yeah. What's not? That was the dream job. You do what I do know you are interested in making documentary television and you know, um, that's it man. That's the wind up. Were there some other options? Because I know he had a giant problem with the travel channel because I know he had told me that they, they fucked him over and did some Cadillac ad. Yeah, I know. He was really pissed about the Cadillac and. Well, what, what, what was that about the I, you know, honestly, I don't really know a lot of the details of the whole story. I don't know what other deals are on the table besides Sienna, but safe to say that the. I think the relationship with travel channel was toxic before that, you know, the travel channels,

Speaker 1:          00:31:50       religious own place at least was, I don't know if still is, I think the original people that owned it because my friend Bert Kreischer has a show over there. I had a show over there, a couple shows. Birth to conquer. And what was his other show? Hurt Bert. Yeah, she's crazy asshole. But uh, you know, Bert had issues with that too. Like when he would be on the show, if we'd all be hanging out together. If you wanted to smoke pot, he had to make sure that Jamie turn the camera away from him. Oh yeah, because they couldn't see.

Speaker 2:          00:32:16       Oh No. Yeah, yeah, for sure. You know, but, and listen, I don't have any inside information, so this is purely like my outside perspective. I don't do the deals and I don't deal in that stuff and make the shows, you know. But uh, you know, I saw a network that was more interested in making, like, you know, the show's about sand castles, you know? Yeah. The ghosts, you know, then they had a bunch of ghost shows,

Speaker 3:          00:32:41       shows her fucking popular. Really popular man. So stupid. The dumbest fucking shows on television and there's like 100 of them. But the thing is if you're watching everybody's scared of ghosts, so if you're watching and it's like people in there in the basement and they have night vision on and they pretend they see something like what are they seeing as, they're a fucking real ghosts, cuts to commercial and then all of a sudden you're hooked and you watch. It's a hook after a hook. After Hook. Yeah. It is the craziest, weirdest thing. It's one of the weirder things on television. Just got co showing the shoot. Those shows, can you imagine trying to make them interesting like you were stumbling around some fucking old house like with night vision, you know, trying to. Is that a fear now? I mean, look, you're, you went from mediator, which is an amazing show and parts unknown and no reservations and so you've got these three amazing shows and they put you on a go show.

Speaker 3:          00:33:40       No, that's not a fear of mine. That might be a nightmare. That might be something I dream about. Wake up sweating through my sheets, you know? No Man. I'm, I, you know, listen, I still work for zero point zero, you know. Hi, Morgan Morgan found it's Mike from finding bigfoot. Listen, we're coming back for season 1000. We're going to find them this year. Please, please come aboard. We love what you did with Tony Bourdain and we think you could do that with Bobo. You know, but here's the thing, they don't, they don't want that. They don't want, they don't want cinematography and art, you know, they want. Listen man, they want some kid, producer, director slash cinematographer that they can, you know, they don't want, they don't want what we do. Big Foot noises. Oh yeah. No. And I'm still, like I said, I'm still with zero point zero.

Speaker 3:          00:34:31       Tony's longterm, you know, long time production company. We do awesome work. We got a ton of awesome stuff lined up. You know, we'll be okay ma'am. But are you going to do more stuff with Steve at mediator? So I'll go out with steve anytime he calls. I just need a little more advanced warning these days. I think they called me last week to see if I wanted to do an elk hunt. Now if you do that, would you try to get in shape first? Like, like heavy duty? Yeah, absolutely. It was the last time I went out. It was um, I got my ass kicked. It's fucking you kidding, man. Dude, he's got, I mean talk about a guy with like, you know, he has no empathy whatsoever for um, for the people he's with. Maybe can't keep up with no man. When you're in the, it's like if you can't make that hike, you're just not making that hike, you know, and you know, he weighs 110 pounds and he couldn't walk for days.

Speaker 3:          00:35:21       Yeah. Yeah. And he's been doing this since he was a baby. Yeah, exactly. No, man, I went, the last time I went out with him was uh, I guess two years ago I went up to Alaska and did the blacktail hunt, but we actually had nice weather, which was kind of unbelievable because I know you've been up there when it's like, you know, 10 days of rain coming sideways. We had to leave early last time was there because a storm was coming and we had to make a decision that says I'm coming every time we went up there, but we weren't gonna be able to get out. There was a possibility. Exactly. Part of me was like, even though we're rain soaked, I want to hunt the last six hours because if I stay the last day, never know that might be the, that so many times that's when you hook up with an animal. Absolutely. I mean, in my experience up there with an animal, sounds like the wrong thing really, really wrong because a couple of animals and catch can.

Speaker 3:          00:36:14       No Man, but you know, like it was. That's exactly the way it was. You go up there and you'd be in six days rain. Then all of a sudden the fog a clear and there's some, you know, black tail standing right there looking at you. You know that a lot of bear up there too. Yeah. Tons of bear. No, but he, you know, I got my ass whipped last time. I went up there first time I went up there, I was still in shape. You know, I was younger. I did pretty well. Well you were doing it all the time. You have to do it all the time. You have the hiking thing is something. I mean you're, you're basically building up this difference in your legs that you only get from hiking. Absolutely. Biking. Endurance is no joke. It seems like it's a joke because if you hike for like five feet, it seems like nothing.

Speaker 3:          00:36:54       You climbed a small hill. Yeah. I could do this all day. You think you could do it all day? You do that for 20 minutes. You can start. He even, you'd be drenched in sweat. He'd want to take your jacket off and then you realize like, oh my God, I have to do this for eight more hours. Eight more days. Yeah. And then the morning. And then if your immune system, is it all tax, it's going to crash hard. You might get sick. Yeah, man, I know you, like you said, you can't train for it. You can't train for that kind of back country stuff. You can go out and, you know, run up and down the stair master, whatever, but that doesn't really. Doesn't train all those little muscles that you use to constantly stabilize yourself. You know, Senator Hassle, help a little with stairmaster will help a little but really helped the major muscle groups.

Speaker 3:          00:37:35       Right. Running hills, uh, helped me, helped me a lot just because it's so much harder than hiking. He's run them. You could do it easier. It makes you hiking easier. Lucky with weighted packs onto. Do you ever do that? Oh yeah, yeah, that's what we did, but not just for training. For training. Yeah, I would. I'm on the stairmaster actually. I'm pretty sure I am. I'm guessing the stairmaster with us. Yeah, no, I'd put weights on my pack and go on the stairmaster. Yeah. Yeah. And boots, you know, boots on the stairmaster. Did they let you do that at the gym where they look at you weird or will everyone looks at you weird? Oh my God. If you're, if you even talk about hunting and Los Angeles and looking at weird metro, you know, like what's wrong with you? It's the fuck that guy got Cammo on for Jesus Christ.

Speaker 3:          00:38:21       Did you were camera with the gym? I feel like I may have had some cammo aspect of my pack of course, but I'm bloodstains you know, I, you know, it's interesting though because I think back on those times and you know, like while we're talking about like all the shitty weather and all that stuff, and then just think back to that. The first time I went out with Steve, him saying like, Yeah Dude, but you won't, you know, you never tell stories about the good days, you know, and I got to say to his credit that's been absolutely true is like those, those shitty days, freezing cold, you know, getting out of here, getting out of your sleeping bag in the morning and putting on wet clothes, cold wet clothes to go to go out and hunt all day. You know, I look back on that with like a great degree of fondness and I also have to say it made me a lot more of a person than I was before, you know, toughens you up to it.

Speaker 3:          00:39:14       It, it toughened me up to open me up to the idea of it opened me up to accepting, you know, possibilities for myself that I had never thought of before. You know, like your capabilities, your capabilities, you know, that, that we, like, we all have that somewhere back down in the brainstem. This idea, this ability to just go out in the woods and, you know, hunt something and eat it, you know, and up until that point I had never done that. I'd done some hiking and some camping. It was always on trails and they're all nicely marked and stuff like that. The idea of stepping out of Steve's the backdoor seeps cabin in just into the woods at that time for me, when I first did it, that was completely new. I was like, well, you can just walk into the woods, where do we go and uh, and then to do it and to have it be successful and to bring that animal back into sit around and eat it and all this stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:40:12       That was a real huge Aha moment for me, you know, personally and professionally. Like, oh, we can do shit that we used to do, you know, 10,000 years ago. It was big for me too. I remember saying that on the show, like when Steve was asking me and Brian on the first hunt, which just by sheer luck we were successful on the, on the first hunt. Yeah. And Steve was like, a, do you think you're going to do it again? I said, fuck you. I'm doing this forever. Like, I knew it. He goes, when did you know? I said, the moment that deer dropped. Yeah. The moment the deer dropped him, like, okay, I'm doing this forever. This is how I'm making, getting my meat now I'm going to do this. Yeah, man, it's the, it's shows. I don't know. There's so many. Just like really glib interpretations of like the motivation behind hunting, you know, I was say cruelty and blood lust and it's like, because in its worst cases that's, that's true.

Speaker 3:          00:41:03       Yeah. And because I, I, I do think that hunting shows for years, that's a lot of what they put forward was like kind of machismo and guys shooting black bears over, you know, donut barrels, you know, um, for all the wrong reasons, you know, the beliefs. We think of that as something that people, or at least I do think of that as something that people eat for food. When you think about Cecil Cecil a little while and that kind of shit really sours people on the idea of hunting because there's no justification for the person for shooting

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       a lion. I mean you have to, you'd have to do decades of education about conservation and the importance of the money that goes for the hunt and then they still don't get it because they're like, why would you want to shoot a line? And that's the good question. Good question. Why would you want,

Speaker 2:          00:41:48       you know, and I would say it's a good question for me too. I like, I definitely have limits, you know, as much as I went around with Steve. I have limits on what I would personally choose to do and I got to say the Africa stuff for me, ma'am, I just, it's not interesting to me, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:42:02       See that's interesting to me in Africa would be to hunt something that I would eat. So they have antelope in Africa. I would love to hunt and hunt and antelope and cook it and eat it. That to me, makes sense. There's no way I want to shoot a hippo or anything else, even if people do eat hippos and I understand they do that. Okay, good luck. Yeah, I don't, I don't want to have nothing to do with any of that, but, but game animals that have been, that are delicious Neil Guy, things like that, that people have eaten forever and that they hunt, they hunt elk or deer here. That to me makes sense. It would be just an adventure to go to Africa, Africa, so fucking scary. It's so sketchy.

Speaker 2:          00:42:44       I mean, I love Africa and I became like, I kinda took all the Africa shows I could on parts unknown. Really. That's mostly wonderful place. Well, um, first of all, I think there's like a, I think it's, uh, there's a lot of misperception when it comes to. I've never had a negative experience there. I've had maybe I had one experience. It was kind of quasi threatening, you know, and we got to. Yeah, I mean, you know, we had a crowd kind of turn on us and throw rocks at us was we were driving away. That's the one experience with like hundreds experiences. Well, we're in a, we're in Goma, in the DRC, you know, and it's just a, it's just a really, really chaotic place. A place has been run over by a civil wars for decades. People are in serious desperation, but I think worse than any of that, there's a huge culture of, um, of nonprofit organizations and stuff there.

Speaker 2:          00:43:44       So I think they're used to kind of white folks coming in with this very patronizing kind of view. Um, and then we're down there with cameras filming them and then all of a sudden they realize that we're not paying anyone for this, you know, and uh, and I think, you know, there's a tendency for people to feel like, well, you're here taking something from us, you know, you're clearly making more money than any of us will ever be able to make. And uh, and what the fuck did we get for it? You know, and I can understand that point of view. And how did it turn into them throwing rocks at you guys? You know, again, they realized we weren't going to be paying for any of this. You know, our security team was like, hey guys, time to get in the car and as soon as you get in the car and you're leaving, it's like, oh, these fucking assholes, man.

Speaker 2:          00:44:31       It just came down here, got not older footage, gonna pack up and go back to their nice hotel, you know? Um, but that's the one experience and little like a lot of experiences there, you know, for the most part I found people that are like incredibly gracious. You know, I've found it to be one of the most hopeful places, honestly. Um, my day to day experiences in Africa, I saw people who were working their asses off on a grassroots level. The [inaudible] like some of the most, um, you know, some of the most like dynamic grassroots capitalism that I've ever seen and people who will literally find any, any way to scrape out an existence and a living. You know, this is not like, this is not a lazy culture. This is a culture that will fight through anything, you know, go to Lagos and legacy is one of the most dynamic cities I've ever been in.

Speaker 2:          00:45:27       There's a constantly moving, constantly people trying to make money, constantly. People trying to find a niche, you know, in a city of 20 million people, you know, so I find a lot of beauty and just like raw human endeavor there. And I think that, you know, if they can clear some of the, like obvious stumbling blocks that they have in terms of corruption, in terms of, you know, foreign pressure, um, in terms of, you know, manipulation of markets. Um, there's, there's tremendous promise there. I mean like, just, just in terms of the, just the Internet and technology sector in Africa is absolutely booming. You know, you have kids that come in from the villages on the streets of Lego's who can take your computer apart and rebuild it by hand, you know, self taught and all of that potential is there to be tapped, you know, and, and they're starting to, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:46:28       So I guess I just find it a hopeful place. That's amazing that you only had one bad experience, only one, only one. But I can say that about traveling the world kind of in general. I mean we've been in a number of, you know, relatively hot zones. I mean we never did active conflict because we don't make that kind of show. Um, but you know, being in places like Gaza or the DRC or you know, I can count on one hand in, you know, in many, many years of doing this, you know, the number of times that I actually felt threatened by someone. You know, I've found that the most likely scenarios you're going to get accosted by a sandwich, you know, or someone trying to, you know, introduce you to their kids, you know, or take a selfie with you. And that's, that's the world that I know. I don't really understand the world that we see on TV here, man, because that's not, that's not my experience. You know, you know, a lot of good people. And again, getting back to Tony, I think that, you know, that's legacy, right? I think that he really showed people that

Speaker 1:          00:47:33       that is a problem with our view of the world is that if it doesn't look scary, they're not gonna show it to, you know, just because if it's not dangerous, I mean other than his show. What else are you seeing on CNN where they are in Africa where it's a good thing. What else are you seeing where people are in Egypt where it's a good thing? What else are you seeing where people are interacting with people on the street and there's not some sort of a murder story or rape story or something awful?

Speaker 2:          00:48:02       Yeah, I mean, I think you're starting, you're starting to see it a little bit. Um, but mostly you're seeing it in like, you know, on like CNN, Africa, you know, network or you know, there you're starting to see them covering stories about entrepreneurs, right. You know, positive aspects, you know, building economies.

Speaker 1:          00:48:21       But it's a real problem in our view of the world for people that don't travel well. Listen, Africa just simply doesn't make news in the United States. I mean, and yet it takes a genocide, you know? Well, all I've been hearing about Africa lately is what's going on with white farmers in South Africa. So yeah, it's very scary stuff where people are encouraging people to attack white farmers, you know, and there's a whole lot of sociopolitical economic shit that goes on without that. I'm not even going to pretend I understand, but uh, that's what you hear about. You don't hear about good things here about how many farmers have been murdered. Yeah. Homes.

Speaker 2:          00:48:57       Well that's a shame man, because, you know, you go there and most of what I find going on there as positive, you know, listen, there's a lot of pain, there's a lot of suffering, there's a lot of bad shit that happens there too. Obviously. I'm not gonna deny that, you know, but uh,

Speaker 1:          00:49:16       you know, we don't hear the good stuff. Did you have a good, did you have like a place where you enjoyed traveling to the most? You know,

Speaker 2:          00:49:24       no, I don't think really because uh, I, you know, this, to me, this is another kind of like real lesson of the show, you know, I think we got to a place where we were finding something kind of everywhere, you know, there's some places that I didn't enjoy as much, you know, but uh, I think most places we found something that was like, oh, this is, this is awesome. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:49:51       what was the one place where you like, Eh, I'm not going back here again. I don't want to say, okay. The positive people keep it positive. Let's just say it's a highly militarized state.

Speaker 2:          00:50:05       Okay. Now and deep divides and uh, on both sides. Yeah. Okay. And, uh, and a lot of beautiful people on both sides, but, you know, um, but I think, you know, I mean this was something we like, we encounter a lot as we kind of progress in the show is this. I, you know, I remember my dad would say it to me all the time. It's like, well, where, where are you guys going to go now? You know, you've been everywhere. It's just like, yeah, but I think we started to learn that you could like really point the camera kind of anywhere. I think a big one for me was like doing this West Virginia show last year, which the place it always been like really close to my heart. Like I grew up there when I was a kid. Um, you know, it's a place that has been, I think like deeply misrepresented.

Speaker 2:          00:50:49       Again, another place has been deeply Ruttenberg, misrepresented in the media, you know, um, and uh, but, you know, we got like I got into town on the scout there and it's like there's no restaurant, you know, it's not just that there's no restaurant like in the town, there's like two restaurants in the county, you know, and I remember having this moment of like, can we do this, this is work, like will Tony Respond to this? And we make a show here. And within two days he was like, this big, you know, very deeply heartfelt statements about the place. I really loved it, you know, and it was kind of another Aha moment where you're like, oh yeah, of course. Because there's something everywhere in the human story is everywhere and dig into it wherever you go, the fundamentals of that don't change. And I think that, you know, what he did was so cleanly and clearly and so free of bullshit, cut to the core of those very fundamental kind of human stories, you know. And um, anyways, it worked well. We won an emmy two nights ago for it. So yeah, posthumous Emmy's are always odd, right? Yeah. That was a, it was a rough night.

Speaker 2:          00:52:05       Um, when he would get the rough cut, would it be length of the actual show and then he would add narration to it. Did he have any say in the editing process? Huge. I mean, so I think that's something important too about who he was, you know, um, I mean like everyone calls him a chef. He wasn't a chef, like he was a producer, he was a television producer, you know, um, he, he would pick the locations he had picked a subject matter for the most part. You know, there were a couple of lights. How did you guys work it out? Let's say if you were going to go to Puerto Rico or something like that, how would you make, make the decisions, how would you decide where to go and why? Okay, well I'll take you through the whole process. So, so tony would come up with a list of places that he was interested in going and maybe we would throw a couple in light had mentioned the West Virginia Show, you know, be like, but this is my list, right?

Speaker 2:          00:52:54       And um, and then he'd write like a brief on each one. I'm interested in x, you know, like I'm interested in Singapore, it's Disneyland with the death penalty. Right. And you're like, okay. So there's like, there's kind of a basic operating thesis, right? We can kind of like go in and look at this place. I'm from this perspective. Um, and so some of them, some of them didn't add the Lego's episode for example, you just be like, we, we haven't been to Nigeria, let's go to Nigeria, you know, and, and so we would start doing research on what that was just big kind of, you know, 30,000 foot macro, you know, what is this environment like, what are the interesting things, what are the stories that have been told about this place and how can we look at it from a different angle. So like the Nigeria one, we kind of focused in on like I said, you know, grassroots capitalism dei, why entrepreneurship, you know, street level, the street level kind of dynamics of the economy, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:53:57       And that became like we could see ways to kind of make a beautiful human story out of those elements. So I'd end up putting down to him probably in like a two or three page thing. Like here are my ideas, you know, here's what I found based on what you were interested in. Here's some other things I've found, this is the way we'd Kinda like to go about it. And he'd either be like, yeah, or no, you know, and from that point, um, we'd just get heavy into research, write a treatment, you know, I'm in break that story into like six acts, right? And then look for scenes to kind of fill in, articulate that story. So it seems like, you know, I have this great economist, I know we're going to need an economist at some point, but we got to put a, economists are kind of boring by nature, so we got to put him somewhere more dynamic where there's this really interesting computer market that has a lot of energy.

Speaker 2:          00:54:55       So let's put the economists there. They can walk around, there's a great restaurant in the corner there. So like here's some elements we can put together that's a scene in a act of the show. So you put all that stuff together and treatment form, send it to Tony, usually minimal notes from him, you know. Um, and then, uh, and then we'd go out and Scout, shoot the show, you know, how weird is it shooting in a restaurant with camera people standing over the table? I think we got, I think we've got really good at not taking over the environment, you know, so I don't, I, I, I don't know. I don't know how to answer that because you do it. How do we save? You and I are having a conversation at dinner and we're being filmed right? Is, would they be as close as Jamie is?

Speaker 2:          00:55:42       Right there to cameras closer. Not around. On top of you. Yeah. It's pretty close. But you know, understanding. Yeah. But we wouldn't use like your, there were rules to that, right? Because like we're a documentary show. We can't just go in and just completely take over some place or take over some village or scare the shit out of local people are, you know what I mean? Like we got to go in with some deafness, you know, so we would go in early and we would light so that the character's Tony aren't really seeing us screw around with lighting, stuff like that. That's all kind of in place. Um, put the cameras in there. No sound guy. No big booms. Sit the rest of the crew down. Are they wearing wireless mics? Yeah, exactly. And then, and then, uh, and then fill in local people and the rest of the restaurant and make sure that there are people who actually go to that restaurant in the restaurant, make sure that fuels like alive, not like full of extras, like miming dialogue and

Speaker 3:          00:56:44       carrying large cameras. Like how big are the cameras are carrying their big cameras, like regular big ole production cameras, heavy on the shoulders. Like you guys would use a mediator.

Speaker 2:          00:56:52       Yeah. Again, you know, but again, you know, it's two guys standing there with cameras that have been traveling, at least from Tony's perspective and traveling with Tony for a long time. You know, it was just like having two more friends at the meal in terms of what the sidekicks, you know, I think we learned early on that like you gotta like you gotta go up, you've got to introduce yourself, you've got to smile, you gotta laugh, you gotta be able to be self deprecating and make them feel comfortable. Like you're there to ask them questions, not to tell them who they are, you know. And um, I don't know, man, it, I, I just say we, we traveled all over the place. A lot of people who've never been on camera for that largely worked, you know, so it must've been doing something right. Was there ever a time you in a restaurant in.

Speaker 3:          00:57:36       We're pissed off that there was people standing there with cameras filming a table. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But you know, that's pretty easy. You know, someone gets pissed off and they wave you off. Okay, cool. Sorry. No, no worries. You know, I, I, it never really escalated, you know, listen, may never escalated. You had a view of the world by doing that show and traveling the way he did that it's less than one percent of the population is ever gonna experience. Probably less than one percent of one percent. Yeah, I would say for sure. Yeah. I mean it's got to be an incredibly enriching journey for you. Yeah, hugely. I mean, here's Lee. There's, I mean it's, I don't know, it's very simple. There's before and there's after and it's two different people really, because just all the data you had to take in the view of the world changes, it gets bigger. It becomes a much bigger place.

Speaker 2:          00:58:29       It does. That's was, you know. That's exactly right and not what's really interesting. I tell people this too, they'd be like, oh well, you know, you've been all these places. It's get out of the gap, but the world doesn't work like that. It doesn't sound like the more places you go, the smaller the world feels more places you go. The bigger the world feels. It just feels bigger and bigger and bigger because he realized like there's, you know, people, every country, there's this county in this country, in this town, in this county, there's this street, there's all these other streets, there's all these other people. You know, our shows were just a sliver of a place, a tiny little sliver, you know, you can go into Lego's. We'd go back to Lego and make 10 more shows. Each one of them completely unique and individual. You know, the world's a big place. A lot of shit

Speaker 3:          00:59:13       going on. Know, yeah, now

Speaker 1:          00:59:20       they're going to keep hearing shows, right? I mean, how long are they going to, how long are they going to do this for? They have. How many did they have all told? How many they did? Five seasons.

Speaker 2:          00:59:29       Actually it's an 18. I guess we're getting near 100 shows, you know, I've never counted. I don't really know a lot of shows. Uh, yeah, they'll keep her.

Speaker 1:          00:59:37       I have it on my dvr so they'll occasionally run these marathons and then I'll go to my dvr and there's like 20 new shows, you know, and I've watched a few of them the other night for the first time I watched it in awhile. I posted a thing on instagram too about it because I, I was real reluctant to watch it after he died. But then I went on a bender wash, like binged watched like three of them in the night. I was like, God damn on a good show. It was.

Speaker 2:          01:00:06       Yeah. Yeah, it was good man. You guys nailed it and you really, you should be really proud. Thanks man. Yeah, and you know, I'm actually still working on one right now, which is maybe the weirdest experience. You know, you're asking about process before, you know, after we chewed it, that's when Tony really came in. What do you do if he's not there for narration? Well, that's the, that's the thing. Who narrates it, you know, I'm not, I'm not going to replace Tony, so no narration now. Yeah. I mean we have our sidekicks, uh, talking to him. We have his dialogue in the field, you know, but who's going to step in and do that voice and how offensive would it be if we did that? It would happen

Speaker 1:          01:00:50       to be someone who is so close to him that it didn't, it didn't freak everybody out and have to be someone who was on the show a thousand times. It was just there with them always. Yeah. That person doesn't really exist.

Speaker 2:          01:01:02       Doesn't? Yeah, there's no, there's no voice there. When you would give him a rough cut,

Speaker 1:          01:01:08       I'm safe. Like I said, a show on Puerto Rico, what have you. So he would take that, he would watch it and then he would start writing.

Speaker 2:          01:01:14       Exactly. So yeah, getting back to process, you'd like, I'd send him an act right once it was in rough cut form and then you get his notes back because that was always kind of a terrifying moment too because you're like, dude, you worked on the thing a lot and you send it off to him. He can go one way or another. Man, I got you. I got gutted a few times but I got a couple that were like out fucking standing, you know, and that's all the notes he had. But you would, you'd send them basically scratch writing. So you'd say like here's what we're thinking, you know, is this kind of idea, goes here, this kind of idea goes here. And then he would actually write it, you know, and you get that writing back. How long will it take for him to do something like that?

Speaker 2:          01:01:54       Oh he ripped that shit out, man. Yeah, he fast. And that's the thing too. I never, you know, there was never an email or a text that he didn't get back to you because he was no slouch man. He liked, he was sharp, he was on it. He'd get back to you, he'd do the work, you know, it. Um, when he took pride in that, we would talk about doing the work. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And he did. I mean, there's another, that's another, another thing that was so delightful about it, you know, suddenly you're having to drag some, you know, carcass along and, you know, prop them up in front of the camera and, you know, he was into it man. And like he had total ownership, total control, awesome. Incredible creative ideas, incredible creative power. Like he was in, you know, and no show was like, yeah, fuck it, you know, we can just kind of slipped by on this one. You know, every show is important and when they, you know, when they weren't working, he was pissed, you know, and great. You know, I think the biggest thing that I miss in this process of cutting this Texas show that I'm doing now is not having the pressure of him looking at it and being like, dude, you know, no man, this ain't working. You know, that was a real benefit to us.

Speaker 4:          01:03:14       Huh?

Speaker 1:          01:03:16       When did he start smoking again?

Speaker 2:          01:03:19       You know, so weirdest thing, man, I, I didn't know. I didn't really know his smoking again. And then the police show came out and I just saw him light up on camera, you know, I was like, Oh shit, I guess we're doing this again. And then a couple of my, like a couple of my shows at the end, he'd start just lighting up on Cameron. That was always like, that was always no go territory. Like in the past when he was smoking, we would like stop shooting, you know? Um, all of a sudden he was just lighting up right on camera and I don't know, shocked the shit out of me, you know, I kind of looked around, the crew liked w, what do we do? Like

Speaker 1:          01:03:58       I was shocked because he said that when his daughter was born is when he decided to stop smoking because he realized that, you know, he had something else to live for that he, you know, he didn't want to be on some cancer bed. Fuck Iron Long. Having his daughter visit him. Yeah. So he quit.

Speaker 4:          01:04:18       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:04:20       it was a bummer when you started again. That's, you know, did he stop going to Jujitsu? I don't know. I, it

Speaker 2:          01:04:30       here's, it wasn't as frequent during the end, you know, uh, during the last few episodes, I know we stopped kind of having to find gyms.

Speaker 4:          01:04:40       Um,

Speaker 2:          01:04:41       and we'd offer, you know, and be like, Nah, I'm cool. So I think the last couple of shows would probably like that for me. I was like, you want to find local gym?

Speaker 1:          01:04:52       It'd be like, Nah, you know, I'm good man. So was it within the last year or so, or less. Less than a year. So he's the last year or so. Yeah. So that's when the smoking started. I guess maybe a little earlier in that. Yeah, that's a bummer. When you see someone quit and then go back on, that is one of the weirder it is of our culture.

Speaker 2:          01:05:15       Does he got through. I mean, he got through the really hard part, you know, couple of years under his belt and you look great man. He was, you know, really, uh, he was doing really well. Now where do you go from here? Where do I go from? Oh Shit, I didn't, you know, um, I, you know, Tony Gay I think gave us tremendous tools to, you know, for how we look at the world and like how we will continue to go on looking at the world and um, I don't know exactly what show I'll do, but I know it will continue that kind of ethos, you know, and I'm like, you know, I feel like I have this very powerful kind of,

Speaker 4:          01:06:02       um,

Speaker 2:          01:06:07       no, like I said, set of tools now that, that he kind of handed us and you know, that, uh, to go on and keep doing this work, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:06:18       isn't the problem with this work that you need someone like him? He kind of need like either a Rinella who's a very unique person and in many ways similar, not self-destructive at all, but really meticulous about his work and a very good writer as well and his narration, like one of the things that separates mediator from any other show is that Steve has this eloquent narration exactly that goes to it and it makes you realize like our perception of what it means to be a hunter is based on stereotypes, negative stereotypes that this is the best example. This is a really well read, brilliant man who has a great passion for the outdoors and for public lands and for wildlife and for consuming wildlife in this, this,

Speaker 1:          01:07:10       this adventure of pursuing it and eating it and cooking it and showing you the art of cooking. You know, the that you, you wouldn't be able to make meat eater with pig. Man. I can't even talk about the apocalypse. Yeah, I mean, come on. Well, unfortunately I enjoyed that with, for all the wrong reasons. There's justification to joining a pork lips, first of all, because you got Ted nugent with a machine gun in the helicopter. Okay, and then two, you have this real wild pig epidemic. It's a legitimate epidemic in Texas and they don't know how to eradicate them. I guess

Speaker 3:          01:07:57       all that, and I've been putting it on television on a hunting show. It's not really hunting, it's assassinating out of a helicopter and they're laughing and that it's that part. It's the mentality behind it. The, you know, I'm like, listen, I'm not saying don't have fun on a hunt. I've bet a lot of fun on hunts, you know, and a great time on a hunt. I don't know. There's something about, you know, just, you know what you're saying. I know. Exactly. Firing off a thousand rounds, cackling inside of a helicopter. Yeah. Laughing when you see pigs do somersaults because you had shot at him. A helicopter, you know, I think I think is one of the things I really loved about Steve, you know, like, or love still that I still love about Steve. Um, you know, a really poignant episode on that show for me.

Speaker 3:          01:08:47       It was when we went up to Alaska and we're hunting black bear and uh, and he decided not to take a shot, you know, I mean, here's a guy that loves animals as much as he loves hunting animals as much as he loves conservation of animals as much as he loves the knowledge and the science behind animals and the natural world, you know. Um, that to me was appealing. Like that's something I can sink my teeth into, dedicate my efforts towards, you know, from working on. Yeah, it was a crazy show, man. I mean, I talked to him about it and his sort of idea of why he didn't do it was so interesting. He just kind of went with his feelings. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. To have a hunting show where you have a bear, which is what you're looking for, lined up in your scope and go, I don't want to do it.

Speaker 3:          01:09:35       I'm not feeling it in a, in. I loved what he said to at the time. So he was like, I'm not saying I'm never going to shoot a bear again. I just don't want to shoot a bear today. And I'm not gonna and that I, that was a big moment, man. That's. Well, that's the words coming out of his mouth. How conflicted must his perception be to realize that? Okay, I'm filming a show where I'm actively hunting bears his camera people. There's a budget behind it. Now I have to make a show about my decision to not have to bear and then next week I'm going to go hunt something else and then the next week I'm going to go hudson something else. Yeah. But I mean that like his ability to, to like admit and kind of understand that the human being is a complex animal with complex emotions and that, you know, this idea of just kind of uniform direction of the human mind is like a total fallacy.

Speaker 3:          01:10:24       Man. We're all over the fucking place, you know? And like, I dunno, I really bought in at that moment if I hadn't before, which I completely kind of had, but I really bought in at that moment. I was like, whew, this is, this is a guy I can always stand behind. You know, one of my favorite episodes. Brave. It was brave because you realized this is on the sportsman's network. Yeah, so the sportsmans channel and they have only hunting shows. Oh Man. And then he's on a hunting show with you got all these people that are watching that would kill to be on a hunt like that and to have a big old bear in their sites what they want and they're thinking, we're going to see Steve shoot this. Then we're going to see them cook up a bear rose and he's getting a c stewed carrots and onions and potatoes and there's going to be amazing and he's got, I don't want to do it. And everybody's like, why? Yeah. And we were like, we're

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       really nervous. I remember when the episode came out was this and when we had done a few things before, like we had failed at a hunt. Like, you know, we had taken shots that missed in the hunt failed. We had gone on a mountain lion hunt where we never even thought mountain land. Those were all kind of moments where like, will this work? Can we put this out in the hunting community? Will they respond to it in every one of those had kind of like hit or worked and I think people actually appreciate it because of the realism of it, you know, that one was like, can you, can you put out a show where there's a perfectly legitimate shot at a very high percentage shot at, uh, at exactly the animal we're going after and the choice to not take the shot, you know, how are People gonna Respond?

Speaker 2:          01:12:00       Overwhelmingly, people were like, hey man, I know exactly how you feel. You know, it was incredible, you know, it was like, it was like this moment and I don't mean to bag on anyone else, man. And I don't know that much about hunting shows before, you know, I know that a lot of what I saw I found to be really, really either uninteresting or just fucking stupid, you know. But, um, you know, I think that it was like this moment where like, oh my God, like, all these, you know, this, this industry is like, missed a big, big part of who the people you know, that are paying attention here are, you know, um, you don't have to just go like sell arrowheads, you know, and uh, you know, and cackle hanging out of a helicopter.

Speaker 1:          01:12:52       Yeah, well that's worst case example, but for some hunting people that are like sort of a deeply indoctrinated into the world of hunting, they don't mind that show. None of mine. And he listened and no power,

Speaker 2:          01:13:06       more power to them. I, I, I'm not, I'm not trying to tell anyone how to be or what to like or was

Speaker 1:          01:13:11       a lot of guys like Steve. I mean, do you know Donny Vincent? No. Similar guy. Yeah. Similar guy. Really, really smart guy. And a just great reverence for the outdoors and for wildlife. And you know, he does everything self filmed and sells the asco films. He's smart, you know, he knows, he knows what he's doing. Cool man. But he, um, you know, Steve, he sort of changed the perception of hunting for a lot of people that have become fans of his show the same way that Tony sort of changed the perceptions. Absolutely. End of cooking.

Speaker 2:          01:13:44       Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I, I, you know, I mean I'm not like terrence malick or something, but like I got a lot to offer and I got to, I got a career. I'm not gonna I'm not going to dedicate my career to these people unless I really, really believe in what they're doing. And like that's, those are two cases of people really believe in man because they were willing to look at an industry or look at something that they loved and say like, well, I have a completely different take on it, you know, and I'm willing to put that out there. Whatever cost. And in both cases at work, because they're both super smart, you know, I'm really capable people, you know? Yeah. I don't think I've ever met really anyone more capable than steve and a lot of ways guy is a, he's, he's kind of a force of nature. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:14:37       he's a very unique person and um, and uh, the, the amount of stuff that he's able to get done as well, you know, written a bunch of bugs and constantly doing these shows and just the enthusiasm to mean he's not just going to these places and staying in hotels. He's sleeping on the ground outside in these, you know, really fucked up places and you know, about a fog back. What happened with the bear attack? I do. Yeah. Yeah. Which is just, if anybody doesn't know, there's a two part series on the mediator podcast about a fog, NAC, which is an island in Alaska where they have enormous brown bears and they got charged and attacked by a fucking 11 foot bear, which is just so crazy to think of. And the description of it. And then they made this podcast right after the fact. So it's fresh in everyone's mind. It is amazing. It's amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:15:35       So amazing story. It's also amazing of center. First time he has been charged and uh, you know, by a number of different animals, it was run over by a moose. Yeah. You know. Yeah. But I will say that, I mean, you get, Steve also is like physically one of the toughest people I've ever met. I mean, I watched him set a beaver traps one time in, I mean, breaking ice with his bare fist to set beaver traps for hours, you know, put your hand in that water for put your hand in that water for two minutes, you know, just bad. Someone who does not have trouble, you know, enduring during a lot of physical discomfort. And uh, and that was what was kind of exciting about the show too, is he was really like willing to integrate that stuff into the experience. You know, it wasn't like, it wasn't like we need to go out, we need the perfect kill shot, we need to set this up. When you said that, it was Kinda like, well, we're just going to go out and we're going to see what happens. We're going to kind of grit our teeth and bear it no matter what, you know, the, where the journey takes us and we're just going to document that. Um, that was super exciting television to make at that time too, is that, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:16:48       I've done five episodes of his show and we struck out on two of them, [inaudible], you know, that's a, it used to be. They will never air shows like that. No,

Speaker 2:          01:17:01       I don't know that they aired. I mean, I'll probably, I'm sure a lot of people will be like, yeah, dude, you don't know what you're talking about, but I'm not sure that they aired a lot of failed hunts before we started doing it. I don't think they did.

Speaker 1:          01:17:13       I don't think it was a popular thing and it might've been done before, but not to the extent the way Steve did one of my favorite episodes. He never, never shot a deer. It was talking about his dad. He was brilliant and I think that was Alaska as well,

Speaker 2:          01:17:29       wasn't it? I don't think it was, it was. It wasn't a blacktail hunt, maybe it wasn't Alaska. No, I feel like it was a cruise deer hunt, I think. And Arizona.

Speaker 1:          01:17:39       And um, most of the show was him using a spotting scope and binoculars, looking for deer and talking about his relationship with his father and there was no music. Whoever edited it and put it together, it was brilliant. Yeah. Perfect. Yeah. Because it was, you know, some heavy, heavy duty shit and it sort of makes you realize like, oh, this is where you came from. You came from a hard man.

Speaker 2:          01:18:05       Yeah. Yeah. Taskmaster. Yeah. You know, um, that was a brilliant episode is also like, I think, you know, one of the things I liked so much about that episode too is it feels so much like the process of hunting, you know, it's um, long hours with people really kinda getting deep into stuff. And I, you know, I did an episode with him too. I, it hasn't aired yet. Um, but it was a lot of that I lead it like just talking about life, you know. Yeah. I really enjoyed that part of Vietnam with him until a written spending those long hours just sitting glassing hills, like talking about our families and you know, plans for the future. And, uh, it was nice, man. I listened. I feel, I can't tell you how lucky I feel in my career to like landed with these folks, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:18:58       Yeah. That's a great one too, right there, those two, those two guys. Yeah. But like we were saying, it's real hard to find those kind of guys. There's not a lot of those kinds of guys out there.

Speaker 2:          01:19:10       There's not a, you know, um, I think, you know, it feels like there's more of what they call premium content now, you know, on tv there's more people looking for things that have more substance to it. But that is. What do you think has happened? What's the shift? I, I, you know, I got, I guess I don't really know. I think I'm, I'm not in development so I'm not really in a, you know, a place to say. But um, I get the feeling that outlets like Netflix have really shaken up the, uh, the paradigm, you know, I think the Internet in general has changed people's expectations and, and uncensored content is so prevalent and so much more attractive. And yes, it's, it's just changed, changed the way people absorb things. Yeah, I think that, you know, I think I, I think, you know, listen, Netflix is there, spent a lot of money.

Speaker 2:          01:20:09       They've taken a lot of swings, not all of those swings of Hit, but they've been pretty brave in terms of like how much and how would a wide range of content they've been willing to take on. And uh, and so, uh, you know, again, I, maybe that's part of what's driving it. Um, I know, um, I've been lucky enough to land at, like I said before, like zero point zero with Chris and Lydia there and their ethos of, you know, making content that like has a purpose, you know, that that works towards bettering, you know, the world or showing people something about the world or you know, connecting people. And uh, and that's probably been the greatest gift. That's what brought me in a Tony. That's what brought me to Steve. You know, there's a connection with them. So there are people out there that want to use the medium to. Yeah, they're, they're idealistic suckers.

Speaker 3:          01:21:08       Well, one of them, that's what creates that satisfying art. I mean, the stuff that we're talking about you, you're not going to get that any other way. You have to have those people with that deep reverence for the subject that they're discussing, the subject that's being portrayed.

Speaker 2:          01:21:21       Yeah. Yeah. And in now again, more and more we have the outlets to put that on the air. Hey, think back to the days when it was three networks, you know, Tony's never again

Speaker 3:          01:21:31       on the air. Now we'll never going to find out about him. I mean, he'll have to stick with being an author. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:21:39       Um, it's, it's a lot of ways. It's the wild west now, but in a lot of ways that's

Speaker 3:          01:21:43       a good thing. Oh, it's a good thing. I mean, it's great thing for me. Nobody would ever giving me a fucking show. It wouldn't have been that crazy. This kind of show where it go. So what do you want to do? I just want to talk to you was going to schedule it me, what are you going to do on the show? Whatever format of discussion. Dope. But it a lot of ways. That's what Kinda, that's what mediator was in the hunting version, you know, it was like, what's the concept of the show? Well, I'm going to hit the shit that I want to hunt when you go to places I want to go and hang out with the people I want to hang out with. Well, you know, are you going to shoot animals? I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. It's something I can't tell you we're going to try.

Speaker 3:          01:22:25       And uh, I was, man again, it was great to be able to do that and have that freedom. And I think CNN, a lot of ways, like, you know, when Tony, that, that, you know, to have the freedom to be like, well, here's a, you know, 60 year old, you know, ex heroin addict. Um, we're gonna do whatever he wants to do. We're going to go wherever in the world he wants to go and we're just going to kind of let him talk right now. Um, well the, the Seattle one, they let them get blasted. I mean, he was, he was smoking weed on camera, smoking weed through the show, going and visiting growers and then going to restaurants high as fuck, like you could tell he was high and he was talking about I been smoking all day, talking about being baked with two people who are growers, the brother and sister with her of Larry [inaudible]. There were a whole. I know they were laughing with them and it's like the whole family's involved is really. That was a great episode band and it also, fuck God damn. That episode got me hungry because you like, you see all the seafood in Seattle and all the delicious food.

Speaker 3:          01:23:31       I haven't been up there. No, that was a good episode. Um, in those, those folks were awesome. I went out to that place and I filmed that and it's like they were like, it was like dream scenario. I mean that kid. Like he, he put together the names. I'm trying to remember it. It'll look just to give them a shout out Seattle episode. I'm growers. It'll come up African American family. But um, they were awesome. They were awesome. And like, you know, that was all that kid he had put together a pdf, showed his family and they were like, cool, let's sync everything into it. And they did and I went out to their place and they were just sitting back laughing, you know, like counting stacks, some money, you know, and all smoking joints, you know, grandma's there smoking a huge doobie. She was like quality control testing these kids working for them and stuff like, you know, rolling joints and they can oil and, and it was just like, it was like good for you guys, you know, like, like way to go.

Speaker 3:          01:24:42       Isn't that the way of like kind of American entrepreneurship is supposed to work well, it's just rare that something comes along. This is controversial, but yet also lucrative has marijuana sales and then all of a sudden it's legal in the state. Totally. And you're like, oh, okay, well we could just do this. Yeah. Yeah. I'll tell you what's funny. The controversial part of that episode was not Tony Smoking because that's legal. It's perfectly fine for him to smoke. It was when he handed the joint to me over the camera. That one was a little. I think that was a little tough for some folks to swallow as well because. Because I'm working, you know, but he's working too. Yeah. Well, Geez, you know, I never thought of it that way. I guess he was working. Yeah, he's worked with, I guess is the idea that you're holding machinery the Hollingsworth. That's right. Shout out to the Hollingsworth's Hollingsworth farm. Hollingsworth far. Yeah, they are. Yeah. Why was it, I guess because maybe they're thinking you're holding a machine that's real expensive gas man or the. I think they, you know, they didn't want the perception that we were just partying and out of control in the field and we, and we weren't man, you know, we're like, we're professionals. So did CNN have a problem with it?

Speaker 3:          01:25:59       I think maybe there were elements at CNN. Someone might've had, someone must have chimed in, but in the end, again, to their credit, in the end I left, you know, they left us alone. Like, you know, that's the only way would make a good show. Yeah. As soon as I was fucking cook, start coming into the kitchen and still and wanting to add ingredients. Yeah, but that's the whole industry. I know. That's the process on believable. Again. That's why this was so refreshing. You know, how rare is it not to get, not to have people just breathing down your neck. All the ton of. Same thing with mediator because Steven Rinella came from the wild within, which was a show that that's where I met him. I met him from that show and I had him on my podcast, but that show was a fucking goat rope.

Speaker 3:          01:26:42       He was telling me that they were trying to let animals loose out of cages and then he would shoot them. Those were the early days when they're like. Then when they were like, there were line items in for like animal wrangler and like, but you know, to everyone's credit and like very quickly at zero point zero. I'm very quickly with Steve, there were like, dude, we don't do that. Like we're not doing that. But it's hilarious at a producer actually came up with that idea like, oh, I know how to do this. Producer didn't know it sounded like a producer came up with that idea. That was just a playbook on how you make tv just pulling from the playbook for sure. You know, I mean air quotes, TV. Yeah, exactly. You know, bad show. I mean, listen, there's, there's a lot of huge mistakes in that show and a lot of bullshit.

Speaker 3:          01:27:22       Um, though it was, I thought it was a pretty revolutionary in a pretty interesting show in a lot of ways. Um, there's a lot of truth in there too, you know, we did end up going out and just like going on hunts, you know, this is a very high pressure situation, you know, but also like this is very typical of kind of like the, I think the way that television works, there's like still as we're out in the field, there's still at the network a lot of kind of infighting and jostling about what the show actually was. Is this a, is this history, is this, you know, reality? Is this subsistence? Yeah. You know, I remember at one point someone saying something like, well, it's not a hunting show, you know, and we're like, I'm like in the field covered in fucking moose blood, you know, and I'm like, well, it looks like a hunting show from where I'm standing, you know, like, I don't know what to say.

Speaker 3:          01:28:17       What does that mean? You're saying it's not a hunting show? Yeah, I think that there's, you know, I don't remember who that was, but I think that they were very leery of this idea of like a hunting show. What was the subsistence shows that they have? They're all hunting and gathering. I mean that is like one of the more popular shows on all of these cable channels where these, these people that live in Alaska and they're trapping now. It is, shoot. Yeah. It's crazy. It wasn't then. I know it's crazy. I mean not John, we're really exploded after that. Yeah. And I think there's something very different, you know, when you take like a, you know, when you take like, I don't know, for some reason when you take Steve, the New York City intellectual and you put them in that environment, I think there was a different reaction then like, oh, these people live

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       in Alaska. It's like watching pygmies hunt, you know, there are these certain days, this is the natural environment of, you know, and that's what they do. And so hunting is acceptable under those conditions. You know, it's like, why isn't it acceptable for someone who like lives it as like a base philosophy in their life. Give them a chance to explain why, you know. But he lives in Brooklyn. Why would you ever hunt, you know, you live in Brooklyn, just go to the shopping center.

Speaker 3:          01:29:28       Well, yeah. Well you must be, there must be something wrong with you if you enjoy it.

Speaker 2:          01:29:32       Right, exactly. And I think that's, I think that's part of the mentality. Well, Tony Address

Speaker 3:          01:29:36       on the show too, you know, I remember one of the first times tony shot a deer on the show and then they cooked it at that same guys restaurant. Yep, exactly what? Marco Pierre White at his restaurant and they shot a deer and Marco put the blood on Tony's head. Yeah, exactly. It's supposed to do and you get your first kill. And then um, they went and cooked it and it was a, there was a lot of that, there was, there was one time where he shot a pig at point blank range with a pistol and I was like, wow, they put that on TV. It was a big. That was a big moment for him. He tell you talked about that a lot. Yeah. So,

Speaker 2:          01:30:10       well, I mean, uh, he um, that was Cajun country, right? Yeah. And um, I think that, I think he, I think the story goes that he liked, he goes, they asked him to kill the pig and he goes up and like just very, very coldly double taps the pig in the head. And I think that he says there's just this moment of silence amongst the crowd, like, oh Geez man, was that, that was cold dude. What do they expect? I don't know. But he was like, he, he would talk about it as if like a gasp came up from the crowd was like, Geez, wow. You know, the Donald, you know, like was like a mob hit or something. Yeah. I think one is enough for a pig blank range. I've seen animals shot in the head though. That could have used another one. Really? Yeah. That's why I think especially with Jesus

Speaker 3:          01:31:09       I've seen, I've seen a couple of pigs go real ugly. So double tap is totally acceptable to me because when a pig goes bad, it's really not pleasant for anyone, man. Yeah. Well it's also, you don't want an animal ever to suffer if you. Exactly see it's still alive, but another one in it. That's always. Yeah. Bow Hunting, rifle hunting. If it's still standing, put another one in it. Yeah. Yeah. Or suffering in any way. I mean, I think that's, you know, um,

Speaker 2:          01:31:39       you know, that's like kind of a responsibility you take on yourself when you decide to hunt. For me, um, when I made that decision and I've been on two hunts now with Steve, I've shot two deer. That was like a very clear kind of aspect of it, you know, it was like, well, I'm taking responsibility now, not only like this animal's life, but for this animal's pain and suffering and the consequences of my actions, you know, so I'm not going to be lobbing off any 750 yard, you know, rifle shots because I'm not qualified to do that. And it's irresponsible to the animal and the potential suffering that you can cause, you know, um, or losing the animal or you know, so, um, you know, and I don't know, I guess that all comes from Steve Really, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:32:31       at least he's got such strong ethics. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I mean it became really clear, uh, with me just knowing him that this guy is a, he's got a, like a very, very powerful moral compass. Yeah. Core set of beliefs that are just non negotiable. Again, both of them.

Speaker 2:          01:32:50       Tony and Steve, I mean Tony, his moral compass is rock solid as well, you know, um, any mistakes that he may have made in his life, I can honestly say he made them with his heart. He made him with his moral compass in mind and making his best attempt to, to follow that, you know, um, and again, that, you know, that was something that was, it was really nice to be around a refreshing of urine, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:33:20       Brian especially in this world of people with gimmicks trying to become more popular and more well known. And he had put zero effort into that. Yeah, I mean, just the basic philosophy of the show. We're not going to fake anything. We're not going to do second takes. We're not gonna know what the one where they were thrown frozen octopus. So this is like a really famous story, right? The Sicily episode. Yeah. And he describes that is like the, maybe the darkest existential moment of his life, you know, it was like, who is throwing the fake octa? The frozen side kicks, so they set up these sidekicks who were like the guy who was running the fishing operation will, I guess they were the psychics and the scene that we're gonna work with Tony. Right. So the way you'd set a scene up normally like that is you'd have like a psychic, someone who's going to talk to Tony and be like, Hey, what are we going to do? Oh, we're going to go out. And the sidekick would be a local, like a local or

Speaker 2:          01:34:13       an expert in something or you know, a fisherman. Probably in this case, I wasn't on that trust. I don't know exactly. But um, you know, and you'd be like, oh, we're going to go walk to us. Do you know someone who fishes octopus? Oh yeah, I know so and so, and we'll go out with them. Right. So, but it turned out that they went to like this very crowded beach, you know, and I think even in the scene,

Speaker 3:          01:34:36       can we really catch activists? They're just like people swimming or a kids with like a snorkel masks, you know, and like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Everything's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine. He got in the water and he starts hearing these plops. It looks above him. And is these dead octopus, like floating, drifting down to the bottom of the ocean. They're lobbing them in off the boat and then picking them up as of late. I got an octopus, a got one, you know, but I, I think again, like most TV shows that do exactly that, you know like where's the octopus wrangler and for Tony, like that was always completely unacceptable way to make tv. So he had no idea it was going to happen before it started happening. No, no. I started happening. What did he say? He, he left and went to the beach in order to like get like seven Negroni's in a row.

Speaker 3:          01:35:25       He was really bummed out about it. I saw him two weeks later in Tokyo and he was still talking about it because like I just, I just had the worst experience of my life. Worst thing that ever happened to me, the darkest moment of my life, the darkest moment of throwing frozen octopuses to the water, completely went against the whole ethos of the show, but he made fun of it on the shelf. Listen, honestly, it's a great scene. It's a great. It's a great scene. It largely because Sally Freeman, the producer of that is like absolutely brilliant and one of the best directors has ever come through that show. So yeah, it was funny to take on realizing that they were throwing frozen octopus into the water. Exactly. Like how mortified he was bi at all. Yeah, totally. But I mean I bet that again, like that's, that's the way it was, you know, like we didn't go in and like be like, okay, action and now cut.

Speaker 3:          01:36:21       Okay, now we're going to move the cameras and say that again. You know, there's none of that man. You. I mean, part of the hustle of the show was like being there with the camera. Yeah. You set up the scene and then you press play and you let it go. And what happens happens. And I'm sorry if you don't get exactly what you hoped out of it, you know, but we're not going to interrupt the world. We're not going to manipulate and control things. That is the difference between really good reality TV in the word reality TV is so weird. Like what does that even mean? Because a lot of these shows are scripted. Yeah. They have these loose scenarios and then they go in a script them and they redo things. The reshoot things. It's not reality. It's like shitty acting with people that are not trained and they're edited with, uh, people talk in front of the camera.

Speaker 3:          01:37:08       Like I didn't know what Mo was thinking. I was crazy. And they got you. Was like, I told Joe What we're going to do. No advanced, no shit. And then it's like conflict, like the Kardashians. I mean, if they've got it down to a science, a science of more ronic television viewing, right? Greg, if you could just sit there, slack, jawed, uh, they'll keep you locked in, they'll keep you locked in the Ed. They're good at it, edits, they'll show you their tits and boom, you cut to commercial in there. Right. That's reality TV with what you guys were doing is more documentary television. Yeah, it is. And it's not saying that. It's not saying that there's no aspect of, of the convention of television there, of course their ears. But we used to say like, you know, like Vietnam doesn't look like that, but Vietnam

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       doesn't not look like that, you know, there is a, there is a refinement in a manipulation in what we're doing because we're choosing these locations are choosing to talk to this person. We're choosing to shoot it in a certain way. That's beautiful. Where adding light, you know, it's not exactly the way reality is, but there's a threshold, there's a line which you don't cross. And that line is, is it a morally and ethically established line by Tony and by the crew that says like there's, there's a place at which it becomes unfair. The manipulation of reality becomes a manipulation. Um, that is now become unfair to the people who are viewing this. The people who are there, you know, we're, we're, we've become selfserving, you know, and that's the line that we chose never to cross. You know, we can make it beautiful, we can refine it down, you know, we can edit it, we can make a compelling show, but it has to, it has to exist within, under this, within this certain threshold or else, you know, what the fuck are we doing know it must be a small percentage of people in the business that have that ethic incredibly small and it's incredibly powerful to have people.

Speaker 2:          01:39:07       I'm backing you that believe in that and, and super rare. I mean, you know, we talk about in the film industry today, how rare it is to have true artur final cut directors, you know, left. There's only a handful of them, you know, largely the studios have taken over that control will equally in the television industry. It's, it's that rare to have people that have the kind of power and control to have the luxury of saying, you know, hey listen, I have guidelines here and we're not going to cross them. You know, and, and have people be like, great, go, go, go make it, you know, and we were able to do that. Yeah. It seems like netflix would be a really good place for something like that. Seems like Netflix will be a really good place for a lot of things. It seems like that's the, that's the best place for like real freedom.

Speaker 2:          01:39:59       Yeah. Well I know how much is real fried when they're giving you money. Anytime someone's given you money, there's always like, you got to get the real way to deal. It'd be like to produce it yourself, but in the end is CNN was the best place to do that, you know, and they really did back us up and they really backed up Tony and that philosophy and they completely implicitly understood what we were talking about when we said, well we can't do that now. It was jeff soccer. Was it his idea? You know, again, I don't know how the deal came about. I assume so because I think it came, it came in just after that transfer of power. So did they, did he have other places where he's thinking about taking it? Started? CNN again? I don't know man. I don't know. I mean, you know, it was a really successful show in its own right at that point. So I'm sure it would have gone somewhere, but that was, I assume it was Jeff Zucker who brought it in and that was like such a brilliant moves, like a perfect marriage, you know? Perfect marriage, the perfect move for CNN, like perfect move for us.

Speaker 1:          01:40:58       Yeah. I thought it was interesting when they were taking a chance on these unscripted television shows. These, these non news show. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:41:05       Have, you've seen the united shades of America? He's all bell and he's great. He's the best. He's a super, super nice guy. Yeah. I did an episode with him in Kenya with Tony, um, which will be the premier of this upcoming season. Oh, okay. You know, so how many episodes have you guys done that haven't aired yet? Well, I think we'll have seven in this next season. That's the only one, um, of those seven that was actually completed with Tony's narration narration, the rest of them are uncomplete and in that respect, and again, we've been kind of fighting through editing those over the last few months and, and trying to figure out ways to, you know, to do this without completely gutting, you know, the, the method of making this show. So wow. Um, and then there's a couple of specials in there like, you know, talking to the crew and stuff like that, you know, so it's going to be a pretty profound see isn't.

Speaker 1:          01:42:11       So um, once you're done with that, you just start looking at new projects and different things to do. And I have

Speaker 2:          01:42:18       couple like assignments already, some projects I'm like pretty excited about, you know, um, I just don't know that they've officially been announced yet. So, uh, you know, but there's good stuff out there and there's, you know, it. One Nice thing in all of this incredibly difficult time has a lot of people have come to us and said like, listen, when we wrote, we always believed in what you guys did and we'd like you to continue doing it. And here's a project we have the we think, you know, so hopefully we can continue to make things in the same kind of, you know, it looks like we can. Well, it seems like

Speaker 1:          01:42:57       the success of the show and then the infectuous enthusiasm that Tony had and that, you know, so many people are fans of the show had for that style of television. It's just gonna lead to more, more people taking more chances and doing things like that.

Speaker 2:          01:43:14       I hope so. You know? Um, I think so. I think it's getting better, you know, um, there will never be another Tony you won't find that, you know, and I think that's something that people will have to be aware of going forward. You're not going to copy that,

Speaker 1:          01:43:32       right? He's Tony and that's what you saw, Gordon Ramsey, they announced some show with him traveling and people immediately just start shitting all over him. Yeah, but he's really from everything I understand. It was like, just like a really good guy. You know what the problem is? The way you phrase himself on the show, the kitchen nightmares. She turns in like an asshole

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       and yells at people that are intimidated by him and that's his shtick, honestly. Just this, this TV shtick. Yeah. As far as I know. I don't know. Yeah, it seemed like a real nice guy. Yeah. I might Guy Fieri too. He was nice guy. Just got crazy. You know, Guy Fieri relentlessly shit out. I'm constantly Jews. But he shits on everybody. Did he show up Martha Raye to. I don't know. Yeah, maybe. I think maybe right? Uh, he would, he would pull that trigger all the time. Dude. He would always make fun of his Lamborghini and I'm like, I'm Kinda like a Lamborghini, like what are you talking about? One of those things you're not supposed to have, right? Like you could have some cool cars like our member when he did the show with the Queens of the Stone Age, Josh home and uh, one of the guys had a 69 Camaro shot.

Speaker 3:          01:44:44       That was a bad car. Yeah. But that's an okay to have bad ass car because it's a classic because it's got style points. Totally. But I would suggest to Tony that he might want to pick up the Lamborghini because the traction control a big problems and big problems when the Camaro. No, I'm sure as most people would have to learn how to drive one of those. That was hot rod, man. The thing was sick. Okay. But listen brother, I'm glad we did this. We reached out. We decided to get together and talk, give a lot of people insight to what it was like to work with one of my heroes. Yeah, me too. Alright. Definitely my hero. All right. Thanks brother. Thanks. Appreciate it, man. Thank you.
