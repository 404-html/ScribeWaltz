Speaker 1:          00:00:00       [inaudible] four, three, two, one. Jeffrey. Hey. Hey. Thanks for being here man. I appreciate it. It's my pleasure and honor and uh, on the day were bill cosby goes to the pokey, crazy, sad story that a sad for some people, happy for others. Sad that he's only going away for, I wonder if that's a death sentence for a man at his age. Essentially it is, right? He's like 81 or something like that. It'd be weird if justice took into account like your health status and awarding. Right. I think they have done that though. Didn't they do that with that guy who was speaker Hassard who was speaker of the house who was convicted for molesting a large number of boys when he was a wrestling coach. Oh yeah. Do you remember that man? Yeah. Yeah. 15 months. 15 months. Imagine they might, I mean that's, that's pure insanity in a wheelchair and he was cool.

Speaker 1:          00:01:00       Yeah. It could have been. Well, there's, there's no way. If he was a 25 year old able bodied man who had done the exact same thing, he would have gone to jail for 15 months for a admitting to Molesta a large number of kids who are under his care. When he was, he was a wrestling coach, right? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, here's the guy in the movie was made of, no, no. A different guy now is that, that was dupont. Dupont was not a child molester. He was just a psychopath who, uh, hired a wrestlers to come live with him and wrestle with them. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah. Yeah. I know one of them, the, one of the main guy in the movie, they, they, uh, the, the, the two brothers, Dave and Mark Schultz, fantastic. Uh, wrestlers who were completely misrepresented in the movie. They made him out to be like, involved this weird gay relationship with him and doing cocaine and all, they added all sorts of shit to that movie.

Speaker 1:          00:02:00       Very weird. How they do that. Screenwriters, you've got to dramatize it. I guess it's sentence wasn't for child abuse. Why? That's why it was that. It says that says the judge said it would have been higher, he would have gotten more if the statutes didn't run out. The limitation for accident in 1960s and seventies ran out to the judge, noted the punishment for such a conviction would have been far worse. I think he actually got convicted for big transactions keeping stuff secret. Oh Wow. Yeah. I had to pay fines. Statutes of limitations. Yeah. So we were talking about bill cosby that a psychology professors and experts were obviously stating that he had some sort of problem. I mean, it's weird because the media will, um, have a certain narrative they want to promote and they'll sort of find, the psychologist will say the thing that fits that. Yeah. So I think most clinical psychologists would say, I've never talked to the guy, I'm not going entire to diagnose him

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       from a distance. I have no idea what his condition is or what his issue is. But then there's the handful who are willing to kind of stick their necks out and say something. And Man, it's embarrassing to be a psych professor for that reason because you're, you're always kind of being represented publicly by the people who are kind of being least professional about those kinds of diagnoses.

Speaker 3:          00:03:21       That is a real problem today, isn't it? Like in, in terms of, uh, identity politics and this, this inclination to draw conclusions and to lean towards one side or the other instead of just looking at the actual situation objectively. And if you're not talking to him, I mean, I'm assuming bill cosby's a terrible piece of shit as a human being. That's what I'm assuming. But you're looking at all this, but I've never talked to the man. I don't know what kind of crazy shit he's got going on in his head. But if all these women are telling the truth and seems super unlikely that they're all lying. Yeah, I mean wizard and it like zero for 50 of them, right. With the same story. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:04:00       He's got a deep dark streak, that's for sure. Um, I mean, the weird thing is, so a lot of people who are successful have a little bit of that dark streak that have a little bit of that sociopathy. Like they can kind of step back from normal human relations and they can either turn it into, you know, abuse and exploitation like cosby did or they can kind of civilized themselves, right? And they can harness that to do something that's good and, and where they're kind of using their ability to take a different viewpoint on things to, um, analyze human behavior or invent things or, or, you know, propose new policies or whatever. And um, so I think that kind of dark streak, you know, if you have it, you have to recognize it and kind of tame it and work with it. And the people who do, I think can often do great things for society and the people who don't end up in jail.

Speaker 3:          00:05:01       Well, this is one of the reasons why I wanted to bring this up to you as an evolutionary psych professor, looking at the human mind in looking at behavior patterns and what's clearly some sort of, I I hesitate to call crime and addiction, but it seems like an addictive pattern that he has, that there's a compulsion to doing this to people, that it's not as simple as he wants women to have sex with them. They don't want to have sex with them. So he drugs them. I don't think it's that simple. I think there's some getting away with it thing. There's gotta be some, he's better than everyone thing because he's, you know, he's royalty in the t in terms of like Hollywood, in terms of show business, in terms of standup comedy, he's always been treated as royalty. I mean, he's been allowed to essentially criticize anyone who wants. He's rarely is there a rebuttal to the, the things that he and

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       you know, he's been criticizing the black community for its use of bad words and for its use of sexually explicit language and, and depictions. And meanwhile the entire time he's raping people. I mean it's fucking

Speaker 2:          00:06:11       amazing. I think one thing that might happen is if you've got this public image as being like squeaky clean family values and you've got the burden of kind of being a moral exemplar like that, you know, just like um, televangelists right? Or anybody who has a big religious following, like the pressure to be good all the time I think can kind of tip people into this. The thrill of transgression I imagine could be quite, quite kind of addictive and I think that's a real danger. And I think that's that kind of hypocrisy is why we should be really careful about kind of idolizing anybody to that degree kind of morally and putting that burden on them.

Speaker 1:          00:06:53       Yeah, I mean, I could only imagine like being an evangelist, being someone who, who preached about the word of God, but meanwhile having this weird hooker thing like, uh, do you remember what was his name? Ted? He ran a giant church and I believe it was Colorado. And the entire time. I used to have a bit about them the entire time we smoke in math and having sex with gay prostitutes and all the while he's going on about, it's always the guys who go on about how awful gay people are. They're secretly gay. It's so common. There's a little research on that. I mean it's not definitive, but it looks like a lot of Ted haggerty like film haggard, cause a lot of people,

Speaker 2:          00:07:39       well a lot of guys who are pretty like outspokenly homophobic and like you put them in a sex research situation and see what actually rouses them. You show them straight or gay porn. Right? And you'll have a plethysmograph and you, you sensed it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:53       What's the graph? What does it is my graph? What does that sense is blood flow in the penis? Oh boy. I need one of those. I need one of those. Just have it in the background of every podcast. But when you come and do the podcast, you had to put these electrodes on your penis and then we were just going to talk about Japanese vomit porn and tentacles. Well, the playthrough graphs don't lie because I'm still not the heart. The heart lies. Not those put his, my graphs.

Speaker 2:          00:08:22       So yeah, the, the people who are often, you know, most hostile to something, you have some, some little issue inside that is creating some conflict.

Speaker 1:          00:08:31       Yeah, I mean normally makes sense. They, they, the conflicted dots of the human being who has this ideal of who they'd like to project and what they'd like people to think they are. Meanwhile has this thing below the surface that is literally everything they despise and everything they rally against. And that is their, their true nature. Yeah. God, it's gotta be the office feeling. I mean, I've known several who were closeted

Speaker 3:          00:08:57       gay men and it's, it's an awful existence. They just live in this perpetual state of just adjuncts and unease. And meanwhile, God, if this, think for the most part, especially if you live in an urban environment and most part people don't give a shit anymore, there's a almost a self imposed prison. And the people that do give a shit, they're the real problem. You know, the, the, the people who are not gay, who really care if someone's gay, unless they're trying to do a cause behind you. Like why do you care?

Speaker 2:          00:09:30       Yeah. Look, if somebody wants to be in the closet about their sexuality, like they want to be discreet for professional reasons or because investors would panic or whatever, like that's totally cool. But I think, and it's so hard to be authentic to yourself. Like it's okay to sort of acknowledge I have this sexuality or these predilections and, and it's up to me to kind of harness them and deal with them and manage them. And if you want to do that privately, that's, that's cool. We should have that freedom. Yes. But if you don't work out those little demons and if you can't acknowledge what's authentic, I think that's where you get these problems. Like the cosby case.

Speaker 3:          00:10:09       Yeah. And I believe there's a difference between discretion, not wanting to discuss your sexuality and out and out hypocrisy there. These are completely different thing. It's one thing, like you said, like say if a guy's a ceo of some major corporation and he happens to be gay and he's just not interested in all the political nonsense and all the social nonsense it goes along with discussing that. Yeah. He's like, I'm just going to keep it discreet. That makes sense. Like why should he have to, but if he lies to his friends, you know, like, or if he goes on the attack and media ass that is, yes. That is damnation in hell fire. We are so strange. Um, as, as a race and I have talked many times about how bizarre it is that we've become really comfortable with seeing people have sex like on phones and you know, I pads and laptops. I mean it is such a massive part of Internet consumption. Yeah. But yet so dirty and so forbidden. If someone comes in the room and you're watching, you slam the laptop shut in disgust, total embarrassment. It's really weird.

Speaker 2:          00:11:19       Yeah. Well it's weird on so many levels. Like I don't do research on whatever, the psychology of porn, but I know people who do. And the fact that you can study it and everyone watches it, but you can't even show clips at a scientific conference. Wow. Of what people are watching is kind of bizarre. A second thing that's bizarre is if you'd asked people seven years ago, you know, in the 50s or whatever, what do you think will happen if there's unlimited free online pornography that has every possible genre of humans, of all sexes interacting with each other, including cartoon dragons and whatever they would go, civilization will have fallen. Like it would be chaos. It that sounds post-apocalyptic. And, and yet we're living in that era and people are still driving their kids to school and seeing like morally judgmental about politics and our ability to carp compartmentalize is kind of all inspiring actually.

Speaker 4:          00:12:27       Yeah, it really is. Um, but it's also our ability to adjust to the times. It's kind of awe inspiring to you think about the different, like I've often talked about, uh, when I was in high school is I was in high school in 1981 my freshman year of high school. And that was literally around the time that vh one tape was introduced into modern America. Is that what was the, what was the exact year vh one? Tapes were invented. We got them in my house, I think in an 82 like maybe I was a sophomore, which is right when you're about the horniest and uh, that's, that's when porn made it into people's houses. And you had to go through those beads in the video store. Do you get to the porn section? And everybody was like everybody but had blinders on and nobody looked at anybody else and it was just terrifying.

Speaker 4:          00:13:15       And you know, you saw your name are there in the late fees? Like should I bring it back today? Oh man, if he paid, I'll just keep it, keep it bucks. Three bucks. If he just stole it costs 30 steel. It just, so you don't have to look, look the guy in the face and in the 70s, seventies really, and her home use in the 70s on the Wiki it says, yeah, seventies and early eighties. Okay, well maybe it was late seventies or something like that. My house, we got it around 1980 I want to say 82 ish, but it changed the world and it changed it in a real sneaky way where nobody saw it coming. But the difference between the access to sex to the looking at sex from 1960 to 1980 20 years, which is, you know, in terms of historically is a very short period of time at any other time other than today. Today it's a massive change. Or if, if you had to anticipate what it would be like in 2038, he'd be like, Oh God, you know, all of you on mucks inventions have come to fruition. We'll be living in tunnels underground and the surface of the earth would be 190 degrees and there'll be no more water. And

Speaker 2:          00:14:21       yeah, people always overestimate how much it's going to change in the next 20 years compared to the last 20. Yeah. Um, but you know, if you'd asked a bunch of, let's say psychology researchers who study like marriages and longterm relationships, ask them in 1980 what's going to happen when you have unlimited vhs porn? Some of them might've said that'll save American marriages.

Speaker 4:          00:14:45       How many do you think would go with that? All the hippies.

Speaker 2:          00:14:49       I think a lot of folks would have, well that's the way you can get your sexual variety needs mat and a kind of virtual fake way. And so that'll reduce the pressure for like infidelities and other folks would have said, oh my God, it will remind people what they're missing. And so it'll, it'll nuke marriages. The divorce rate will go to 80%

Speaker 4:          00:15:07       but then there's the third option, which is the sort of the cosby ask thing is that the addiction that there's, there's, and maybe I can ask you about this, like what is it about things, whether it is gambling or you know, whatever video games, there are things that people get obsessed with and those things become almost a part of who they are. It takes over their minds so much. Like if you had a pie chart of the human brain with some folks, there's a giant chunk. This just porn. It's like 40% of the brain's porn. Yeah. Like what happens? What is, what is it about the mind that makes one obsessed, whether it's with gambling or whatever, whatever, the vice, whatever the, the thing that makes you

Speaker 2:          00:15:53       dick did. Well, I mean, one, one issue is people differ in their, their conscientiousness, right? Their degree of self control and their ability to kind of resist temptations and keep their eyes on the target. Like career, family, kids, you know, do the right stuff. Um, other people like I just can't control myself in any domain of life, whatever it is, video games, porn, um, doing my homework, whatever. But I think we also have to cut people some slack because remember now if you're a teenager and you're really into video games, call of duty, whatever it is, there are literally thousands of people designing that game to be as addictive as possible and Beta testing it and refining it and, and you know, doing the level design. So it gives you just the right reinforcers at the right pace. And of course we're not going to be very good at resisting that because the power of capitalism and tech and innovation to kind of exploit our brains is, is pretty awesome.

Speaker 4:          00:17:03       Am I being naive or are they just trying to be entertaining? I mean, I'm just trying to make an amazing game that's totally immersive and sucks you in. Or are they really thinking, Hey, this Jeffrey Miller guy, I want to get him fucked up on battlefield earth now. That was the John Travolta movie, right? That that did not succeed. Okay, let's just say unreal tournament. I want to get him fucked up on unreal tournament and get him completely addicted to this. They're just maximizing sales and profit and what are they doing it consciously or are they just trying to make the best possible game that's so entertaining and then it just as a side effect, it becomes a addictive, I think it's s

Speaker 2:          00:17:40       well, okay. If you're running a video game company that the folks actually doing the programming, right? Character design level design and whatever, they want it to be awesome. They want it to just pick the best game ever. That is just so fun to play, but the management knows we have to sell it. We have to make it compelling, we have to make people excited about the next version and, and you know, the add ons. So I think there's kind of like a super ego and ed issue going on even within companies, whether the designers just want it to be cool and management just once a viable commercial product. But

Speaker 4:          00:18:26       doesn't that just come with something? That's cool. I mean, I'm, I'm just playing devil's advocate here because I'm not exactly sure how. I'm friends with a few guys who make video games. Uh, Cliffy B who, uh, worked for epic games, who makes a, he showed us unreal way back in the day, even before Jamie worked here. We get to see them making unreal tournament, like as it was be made. And, uh, I went to the aid offices when they were working on quake three, which are just these amazing games. And it seemed to me, and again, I could be naive, but it seemed to me that all they were doing it was just trying to make awesome shit that they like. Yeah. And then it became addictive just cause it was so good.

Speaker 2:          00:19:04       I think that's most of that. Um, yeah, I mean this summer, like my girlfriend and I were each doing, working on our next book proposals and we each got a little bit addicted to age of empires hd, which is like back in the day, 20 years ago. And it's really fun because we learned a lot about each other, just watching each other play. Like we had such different strategies and in terms of like what you build, what you prioritize, how you deal with enemies. Like it, it's an amazing kind of personality test [inaudible] its own right. Um, and we each got a little bit addicted temporarily and in our own way. And I don't think that's an intention of the designers. It's just if you make anything awesome, whether it's music, whether it's standup comedy or sex, whether it's sex, whether it's long form TV drama, um, like Ozark, then people want that. You know, it works. It's, it's brain candy.

Speaker 4:          00:20:04       Yeah. I saw you quote you, you posted about Ozark after I posted about how amazing it is. I'm completely wrapped up in this second season. So incredible. But you were saying how they always make the kids bratty. Yeah. You don't have kids Dhea. I'll have a daughter. You do 22. Oh, okay. I didn't think she was bratty at all. I think she kept it remarkably together for a teenager who's parents are murderers and drug dealers spoil alert. I thought it was, I think she's Jimmy and she needs some time alone where they need to talk to her. I mean, you can't just let her go through life hanging out with some kid who lives in a trailer smoking weed and steel and books.

Speaker 2:          00:20:38       You got it. I kind of warmed up to it after, like I'd watch the first couple of episodes and she seemed kind of Bratty the daughter. And really and that, and then, and then be amazing. My kids. Awesome. And, and I don't know why all kids aren't like her, so, um, but I think screenwriters get lazy about this stuff. They think, well, if there's a family you need marital conflict and you need parent offspring conflict and you need secrets and lies and, and,

Speaker 4:          00:21:09       but I think the way they're handling it is amazing because the kid doesn't have that kind of conflict. The kid has, like, in my opinion, uh, a typical sort of a relationship with his father where he admires his father and his father's abilities and, you know, and he seems to be, it's, I just think that shows fucking great. It's just so well read a written rather. It just, so it's so twisted and there's so much going on. So many different levels. It's like I get anxiety, I start sweating and I feel like I'm buried body.

Speaker 2:          00:21:40       Well, I love that you don't really know what's going to happen and legitimate. Like it's, you know, game of thrones, you had that thing where any character could die at any time. Yeah. And that's what that was one of the major things that people watching. Um, and I think with really good TV drama, you get that kind of engagement where it's, it's like real life. Like, you know, the series will continue but you don't know any particular character. Well, but

Speaker 4:          00:22:09       we didn't have that for most of culture. That's what's really interesting. It was through most of mass media fiction that you saw on television in the movies, the good guy one. Yeah. You know, and it was real predictable and there was always like a little bit of drama. Like he might lose, he might lose. Oh, he wins occasionally. You had something crazy like Thelma and louise driving off the cliff and you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa. There's off themselves. That's the end of the movie. And he would leave the movie theater like, Holy Shit,

Speaker 2:          00:22:42       what a gangster move. You know, there was a few movies like that, but for the most part, yeah. Well starting in like the golden age of cinema in the 70s the counterculture cinema, you sometimes got those really profound surprise endings. But one thing that made an example, the hustler vanishing point. Oh, okay. That was the one with the challenger. The guy had the challenger. Yeah. It's like I forgot to suicide by storm. I remember the car. Awesome car. But I mean, one thing that makes me optimistic about America is that the same adults who are being completely insane to each other about politics on twitter, whatever are watching this really sophisticated, you know, emotionally insightful netflix stuff. Yeah. And I can't connect those, those two things. It's like when people aren't talking about certain issues to capable of, you know, really in appreciating really insightful drama that's about the subtleties of human relationships and moral ambiguous situations. And then they go into the voting booth or get on twitter and, and it's like there's black and there's white and that's it. And, and, and I hate those people and I love these people and I can't connect the dots between, you know, the entertainment media that we appreciate versus the kind of ideologies that we over simplify.

Speaker 3:          00:24:11       Yeah. I think twitter and I think, well twitter in particular, but blogs as well. I think it is a horrible way to communicate when you are saying something that's in dispute, you know, because you're not challenged. And I think there's also, whether it's 140 characters or 280 characters, I just think this limited way of writing in text without talking to someone, without being in front of them and communicating with them and the subtleties of human interaction and social cues and recognizing people's feelings. And it just, it's a piss poor way of getting your thoughts out. And it's very non human. You know, it's, it's very, um, it's, it, it tends to gravitate towards cruelty because there's no consequences for saying cruel things. It's almost like you're throwing a bomb over a wall and you don't know who's over there. You know, like you don't, you're, you're not there seeing it.

Speaker 3:          00:25:07       You're not, there's something about that that I just think is alien to the human condition. And I think it's, it's having a real effect on our civilization and our culture and how we communicate with each other. And I think it's galvanizing the, the polar opposites and it's making people go towards these extreme left and extreme rights, especially people that are easily led or maybe not so thoughtful about, you know, the objective way that they're interpreting these events and not, not being introspective and not looking at themselves with a critical eye and just engaging in this sort of back and forth tribal shit with people that I just think is a, it's so strange to watch and particularly with when you read something and it's really well written, like you could tell this is an intelligent person that's written a bunch of nonsense and called people outright and Nazis. And what's the most recent one? Um, that box voc speaks about the radical, what is it? This is a new, the radical, right. The reactionary, right? Oh yes. That's it. The reactionary, right. This is the new one. We have a new one now. It's new. It's only like a couple of weeks old. The reactionary, right. It's a baby. Yeah. It's time to,

Speaker 2:          00:26:24       I mean the weird thing is people do have a hunger for this more primal engaged kind of long form discussion, which is why podcasts like this are really popular. My people are willing to listen to, you know, to reasonably smart people talking for an hour three about cool topics because that's the natural condition. You know, imagine our ancestors a hundred thousand years ago around the campfire having a discussion about some fraud issue. Well, they would talk it through until it was more or less resolved or unless they at least identified, here's the things we can agree on and here's the things we can agree to disagree on both twitter, it's, it's just the exact opposite. It's not sitting around the campfire, it's, it's lobbing these hand grenades over the, and it's an infinite number of hand grenades. Like say if you have 30,000 followers or something, God, that's 30,000 people that might be lobbing hand grenades and then they might retweet to a bunch of other people and oh Jesus.

Speaker 2:          00:27:24       Then kier comes some, you know, especially if it's on some hot button topic that they would like to chime in on. You know, this, this is strange. Yeah. Well I think, you know, the human social psychology is, it's very hard to reach any agreement without a certain amount of back and forth, preferably face to face in person with as much time as you need. Yeah. And this is why things like, um, the sort of time limited presidential debates drive me nuts. I would love to just have 50, 60 hours of candidates. Sure. Talking it through and people can tune in and just here, okay, here, here's six hours about foreign policy. Let's see what they really, and then voters could have an informed choice. Imagine candidates actually learning something from each other, right. And being open and honest about that. Instead they have to pretend that they're, their ideas are rock solid and completely well thought out and rigid and impossible to evolve.

Speaker 2:          00:28:31       This is it. They've got it and you're wrong. And more what my opponent wants is some something terrible for America. And God, we've, when we've seen this hustle so many times and yet it's the same hustle every four years. Yeah. I hope we get to a future where people are allowed to be epistemically humble. Like here's what I don't know and I don't know a lot about most things. Even if politicians or scientists or media figures, we're able to take that attitude. Yeah. And just, it kind of gets back to the hypocrisy point, right? Everybody inwardly knows about most topics. I know virtually nothing or I've heard a few things third hand that I can kind of regurgitate at a party. Yeah. But we're all kind of expected to have an informed view about everything. And this is something I try to model for my students. Like if they ask a question and I really don't know the answer, I try to make a point of saying, I don't know, let's look it up. That's awesome. That's so important. The idea that you should know everything about everything is preposterous. Yeah. And you know, if your 20 year old underground, you don't know what the typical 50 year old knows, you might think, Oh, they've probably mastered most of the wisdom and the world already. Or he might think, no. Uh, the, there's like gigabytes of stuff and they can't possibly know at all.

Speaker 3:          00:29:58       There's such a spectrum to the average person that has a like a very intensive job. Like say if you're involved in something, a computer coding, electronics, something that's 10, 12 hours a day, you're engrossed, you don't have a lot of time to focus on other areas. You don't really have a lot of time to expand your understanding of whether it's biology, mathematics, whatever it is. It doesn't apply to what you do for a living. Really have very little time. So this, this notion that you, like people are embarrassed about things they don't know. And I think that's really unfortunate. It's, it's, it's one of the main stumbling points when it comes to like open and honest discourse. There's not, you're not dumb if you don't know some things, you know, you just don't know some things and you just, no way, you know, everything.

Speaker 2:          00:30:49       Yeah. I think that's a great point. A lot of people have these cognitively demanding jobs and that's not just white collar workers. I mean a lot of manual trades. Um, you've got to think about what you're doing and it, it's hard mental labor and then you get home and you have dinner and you have the kids and their homework and your family life. And what are you going to do? By the time you finally have some alone time at whatever 9:00 PM are you gonna, you know, turn on the nature channel and watch a really hardcore David attenborough, you know, animal behavior documentary or you're going to be like, oh, just rewatch, you know, um, unbranded or whatever. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:31:31       Yeah. I mean, people want escape at that point. Yeah. It's, there's not enough time in the day. One of the most beautiful things about podcasts, it was completely unexpected for me, is that it gives me this very unusual opportunity to sit down and talk to somebody without any interruptions for three hours, which I could never ask someone to do in real life. And why it never came up before. Like even to have dinner. If you and I went out to dinner, we'd be talking in, you know, maybe someone else would be with us, different conversations to be eating all this amazing. Did you try that? Oh, this is good. Yeah, what do you have to blah, blah, blah. This is like little simple conversations. It's fun and everything, but it's not completely locked in like this with the headphones on through a microphone. The knowledge that other people are listening and that these, these subjects that you're discussing, you're allowing these ideas to play themselves out and you're, you're sort of moving them around and asking questions and you're looking at them from different angles. And, and to have that liberty and freedom to do that is a very rare thing. And for people that get to listen. And I, I enjoy Sam Harris's podcast in particular radio labs, one of my favorite, but one of the th there's so many good ones out there, but what's really good about them is that you get a chance to listen to discourse uninterrupted and uncensored undirected. And this is something that I think is sorely missing from the rest of our culture. And it's one of the reasons why these things have caught on so well.

Speaker 2:          00:32:58       Yeah. I mean if you respect the ideas that you're talking about, you should be willing to give time yes. And attention. Yeah. And let them kind of breathe, like opening a bottle of wine and just letting it do the aeration thing before you pour it. And

Speaker 2:          00:33:14       it's funny how much of a thirst there is for that. I mean, if you'd asked me 10 years ago, would anybody ever spend three hours listening to a podcast, I would have said, no, there's just this, there's one way out acceleration of culture that's going to be faster and faster and nobody will watch more than a 92nd clip on youtube. It's, that'll be it. Yeah. And instead it's the opposite way. I think people have a yearning for a more relaxed pace of dialogue that is actually a break from the frenetic pace of their work life. Right. Yeah. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:33:52       I think even like leaning towards things that are like tech reviews, things along those lines, those are getting longer and longer when people are just, I mean, there was never a television show where someone would discuss cell phones in depth with no interruption for over an hour. That's very common now where, where someone will go over all the different details of a phone and let you know, like, here, here's what's new about the galaxy note nine and, and the, the gift fucking hundreds of thousands of views. Like clearly someone's missed something.

Speaker 2:          00:34:26       Yeah. I mean, even on Youtube, like you can get 25 minute reviews of like an ar 15 accessory. Yeah. Not just like the rifle, but like the red dot scope or whatever. And um, or you, I'm sure there long but wanting reviews or whatever. Oh yeah. There's a lot. Yeah. I've seen them all. And I, I mean, I think that's just a more natural pace of, uh, human human discourse because no bear in mind, like a hundred thousand years ago, sitting around the fire with a bunch of people,

Speaker 2:          00:34:58       no smartphones, no video, no TV, no movies, no recorded music. The entertainment is each other and it's not rushed. It's like the sun, the sun went down. None of us are going to sleep for four hours. Um, what do we do? Entertain each other with jokes. No, I mean, break out the Ukulele. They wouldn't have done standup comedy, but there would have done sit down comedy. Well, somebody's probably stood up. Yeah. You know, held court told some good stories, you know, I mean, a good story is always valued. Good storyteller. This is what my anthropologist colleagues tell me is, you know, your status, if you're in a tribal society, a small scale society is heavily dependent on not just how good a hunter you are, how many kids you have. It's how entertaining are you in the evenings. Sure. And the people who are just break the monotony or just gold there, their treasured.

Speaker 3:          00:35:57       Yeah. They give you fuel to give you energy. Like when you're around someone who's really hilarious to telling great stories, he like everyone around it was like, ah, you get fired up by it. Yeah, yeah. Um, it's, I don't, I mean I have a rosy view of the future. I'm very optimistic and I think that all the chaos that we're going through right now politically and socially in particular, this is, I feel like this is just an adolescent period of communication that we are experiencing this, this open flood. Like we've opened up the, the barriers for communication. Anybody can communicate now and it's just k and it's going to take a while before the discourse levels out and you've got a lot of loud noises on, on all sides. And there's a lot of people fighting for power and fighting, fighting for virtue, fighting for, you know, whatever Social Brownie points they get by pointing out their position being correct and your position being foolish and silly. And this is the future and this is done. And it's, there's a, there's this cruel aspect to it, which is interesting. Like when if someone missed steps and someone says something that they regret and then they delete it, there's this cancel culture, get rid of 'em off with his head because people realize the immediacy of all this and there was terrified of it happening to them. So it's like they're just throwing rocks at whoever might be the accused. It's fascinating to watch, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:37:30       I mean we're going to need a whole new set of social norms where people just calm the fuck down about this stuff. And I think it's kind of analogist like one of my favorite books about kind of social history is called dog, the bourgeois virtues by Deidre mccloskey and economic historian. And she points out when you switch from like the Middle Ages where everyone's a peasant to this urbanized commercial culture where people are mostly um, traders and they have little shops and whatever they needed to learn how to interact with strangers to provide value for money and they needed a whole new set of virtues that had to do with reliability and thinking, what am I making, what goods or services in my providing that actually are useful? And it took, you know, a couple of generations for people to enter that kind of capitalist mode of what can I do that's helpful to others that can support my family.

Speaker 2:          00:38:29       And I think now we have a cultural shift where we realize, given social media, how do we cope with the fact that everybody virtue signals, everybody sometimes says things that are, that are mean and stupid and everyone's fallible and anything you say will be on a permanent record basically. Um, how do we cope with that? You know, we're, we're used to a sort of public culture where everything is very polished and edited and curated and, and that time has gone. So we need a new set of kind of social and moral norms that cut each other a lot more slack, I think.

Speaker 3:          00:39:11       Yeah, I would agree with you and I would say that the inclination towards tightness and communication and understanding should be rewarded and that we, we, we need to reward that. And I don't want to say ostracized people that are inclined to go towards this cancel culture idea, but we need to let people be aware of it. You know, we were talking before the podcast that I have like all these emails that I can't catch up on because I was gone. I was in the mountains for six days with no cell phone service at all. I felt better when I was there. I just did. I feel like there's a certain amount of anxiety that comes with being connected to all these people all the time and constantly checking your mentions and constantly looking at Google news to find out what chaos is coming our way.

Speaker 3:          00:40:00       And it's just, I just don't think that that's healthy and I don't think, I think I do my very best to mitigate the negative effects of it, but my very best is not good. So don't think we're doing a great job because when it's taken away from me, and I've had this happen twice over the last few months, um, I was in Lanai, this small island off of why one of the Hawaiian islands and I broke my phone and it took a few days for them to send me a new one and I was like, God, why do I feel so good? I feel so present and it feels so healthy. And then this last past week, the same thing, no cell phone service for all these days. And so I just felt better.

Speaker 2:          00:40:42       I think there's a funny thing even that it happened with burning man culture where like when it got started in the early nineties it was let's all come together and have this excitement of interacting more. And now since burning man is one of the few places where you don't get cell phone service and you can't really be online, it's like, Oh man, this is such a relief because we literally can't stay connected. And the community we're in is only 70,000 people instead of 331

Speaker 3:          00:41:11       it was almost boulder that's almost boulder, Colorado. I think boulder's a little bit over 100 so 70,000 is, that's a fucking big city of freaks. It's

Speaker 2:          00:41:24       city, but it feels intimate compared to twitter. Ooh, right. Yeah, for sure. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:41:31       I, I'm fascinated by burning man. I

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       can't go because hippies will drive me crazy and there's too much dust. Yeah. But I love the idea and I'm up fully support. If there was like a fun do, you could write a check like to support burning man. I supported as a project, as an idea. I don't necessarily want to go there until they got it really polished and worked out. But I think what the idea behind it is fascinating. It's the people saying, I don't like this. I don't like where this is going. I think there's a lot of people that would like to do something different. Let's just try it out for a week. Let's just everybody, let's agree, we'll get together through these days and let's, let's just fucking dance and we'll have glow sticks and where pastries and get fucking crazy and do ecstasy. And a lot of people were like, fuck yeah, let's do it.

Speaker 1:          00:42:20       And then this thing happens and this thing is only a few years old. I mean it really is. What, a decade and a half. How many years have they been doing it? The night? The first burning man. It was like the late eighties but it was just like a couple dozen people and now it gradually grew and it really became a pretty solidified subculture by probably the late nineties and no leadership. Well there is guy behind it. There's behind the scenes leadership of course. I mean that's another fascinating thing is depending on the political lenses that you wear when you go there, it's either like a libertarian paradise or it's a communist paradise. Mm. Or it's pantonium self organization of some sort. Um, but there's, there certainly are people who are kind of coordinating it. It's just they're not, well there's tickets now you have two tickets. It's hard to get, it's hard to get tickets.

Speaker 1:          00:43:18       It's even hard to get a parking pass. But this is my point. Like why would they want to limit this thing? Like who, who is like a bit coin thing. Like you're arbitrarily limiting the amount of bitcoin or deciding there's only a certain number and they're doing this with humans are just saying, well I can't really go over 70,000 is just, it's not going to work. But what if they did? What if they just opened up the floodgates and said, anybody who wants to come to burning man and, and, and get get fucking crazy. Just come on down. How many things, how many things would come? Um, half million pool boy. But it would be chaos, right? Cause it would like who supplies the porter potties and the emergency medical services and the therapists for people having bad trips. Mm. Um, like you need some infrastructure and then, you know, Nevada state police have to kind of make sure there's not like murderers and stuff, but do they come around? Oh yeah. The wander around. They police how fast you drive and they must be so annoyed. Like what did they have been dealing with up until Bernie man fucking nothing. No, just a little bit of mass hearing. Their cow got loose. Someone blew up a trailer

Speaker 4:          00:44:31       cause they got their mixture wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:44:35       But yeah, it's, it's fascinating in terms of, um, how quickly it went from not being a thing at all to being its own subculture with its own mooch. They'll moral norms and dress styles and systems of virtue signaling and um,

Speaker 5:          00:44:56       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:44:56       sort of political expectations about what beliefs are the right ones to have, even though it didn't start out political at all.

Speaker 4:          00:45:05       Well, whenever you get freaky you go left wing. Like if you get freedom and freaky and drugs, it's left wing period. Right? I mean there's no real, I mean unless it's some eyes wide shut type shit. We were wearing masks and everybody's got a

Speaker 2:          00:45:20       right. Yeah. You don't typically hear people like, well I went to burning man, I dropped acid and, and I realized like Mormon monogamy has really the proper way to live.

Speaker 4:          00:45:34       Yeah. They're nice people though. They might be right. Yeah. Yeah. Mormons are the nicest called of all time there. They are. Some of the nicest folks. I know. If I had to say if like there's one religion or I had to say like what are, what are the, what are your expectations of friendliness and niceness? Like wait, where's, where's the highest expectation? For me, it's Mormons. That's one religion. Like I think it's nonsense. I think Joseph Smith was a little con man, 1820 when he found golden tablets that contain the loss work of Jesus and only he could read him cause you had a magic rock and all that crazy shit. It is absolutely ridiculous. But the end result is a bunch of really nice folks. Like they have a wonderful community. They're really nice to each other. Once they got rid of all that polygamy shit, you know, once they got rid of the 90 wives and you know, dressing up like a pilgrim, they, they became like a really nice community of people. They're like generally really friendly.

Speaker 2:          00:46:33       So my Granddad, who was a business school professor, um, back in the forties, he moved his, his little family to Salt Lake City and they live there for a while and he was really inspired by the kind of family values. And I think that was one reason he sort of went on to have 12 kids of his own. And not that he turned mormon, but he thought they're onto something in terms of how seriously they take, um, the future, both on earth and in the afterlife. They believe in the afterlife, don't they get a plan and have their own when they die? Right. Well, this is something I loved about the TV series, the expanse. I don't know if you've seen it.

Speaker 4:          00:47:09       We keep hearing about it and I haven't gotten into it yet. It's just too many damn shows. They're awesome to watch these days. But as soon as I'm done with Ozark,

Speaker 2:          00:47:17       I'm gonna jump in. What I loved about it is it's maybe a couple of hundred years in the future. And so we've colonized Mars and the asteroid belt and there's one group of people who are building the first ship to

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       the distant star system and who's doing it? The Mormons of course. And I thought, of course, of course it's going to be a religion that has a farsighted approach and that's kind of pro natalist and that's all about family values and like increasing their numbers and, and yeah, of course it's going to be that. I'm not

Speaker 6:          00:47:53       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:55       What's the social justice warriors putting together and star ship? Yeah. Did you ever see the um, um, the Osman family photograph from one of their albums, the early albums where they all got their own planet because they think that when you die you get your own planet. And so the album was based on that concept and like if you open up the album, it's like, Oh, here's a fun planet. Donnie. Look, Murray's got her own little asteroid belt. Yeah. Third, they're totally locked and loaded to do the uh, the interstellar colonization. It's strange though. I mean it's true. It's strange the blinders that people go on that people put on and that they would put those blinders on. Like it's almost like if you just can go, hey look, let's just all admit Joseph Smith was full of shit, but we got a good thing going on here folks.

Speaker 1:          00:48:48       We're all real nice to each other and that seems to be some real positive energy involved and believing in this higher power and this greater good and this overwhelming sense of community that we all have. And they have a sense of humor about it, like the way they reacted to the South Park guys doing book of Mormon. It's fantastic. It's like fair enough. They took that Hillary page ad in the playbook. I mean that, that and that is a brutal musical in terms of like the way they're depicted buffoons believing in nonsense, trying to recruit these indigenous people. It's kind of, I mean it's ruthless and hilarious at the same time and they're like, wonderful. If you want to find out more about being a mormon here, come, come, come to our website. Come check it out. Thank you. I think having that humility and that sense of humor about what you're doing, I wish we saw more of that in like academia because there's a lot of fields that are very bad and don't do good work, but that are terribly, terribly serious about it. Like what gender studies or dare you, social psychology, gender studies. I posted something on instagram yesterday. Um, I was at a bookstore and there is a feminist baby. A book says feminist baby finds her voice and it's a baby screaming into a bull horn. Look at this picture, baby screaming into a bull horn and, and I said that the lines between parody and reality have never been blurrier and some people laugh, but a lot of people call me a piece of shit and I

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       is one of the rare times I dove into the comments just to take a little look, see into the gates of hell, but look, that's fucking parody folks. Why is the baby screaming into a bull horn? What voice does she have? Did what? What oppression is she rallying against at three months old? Is she screaming about the patriarchy when she can't even fucking talk yet and he hears more parody? Why she fat and ugly? What kind of baby is that? Baby looks like a thumb. She doesn't even have a chin. This is chaos. It's not even a real baby. It's like an m and m with legs. It's crazy. Look, she got fucked up hair and they've already gendered her. They put a bow on her, which is really fucked up to do to a baby. You've decided that she's a girl. How dare you? You piece of shit. You transphobic asshole

Speaker 2:          00:51:14       and the [inaudible] is a little bit over. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:51:16       she's got horror makeup on. She dressed up like a fuck clown already as a baby. Fucked up hair. Child abuse, big nutty eyes. It's crazy. Finds her voice. She found her voice. Fantastic. She can't talk yet. That's a baby. What we should all listen to the baby. Give the baby a bull horn. Let's all gather round. I got poop. What does the baby, what is it baby saying? She finds her voice. Look, it's parody even at the book is wonderful. I don't know that it's not. Maybe it's a great book. Maybe it's fun. Maybe it's a silly book that's parody that fuck. That would be a goddamn character on south park. A baby feminist with a bow that screams at the top of her lungs. What does this free the nipple. Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:52:05       Oh, like right now I'm hungry. I get it. Yeah. Oh, is that from the book? That's from the book. I guess feminist baby, maybe it's a great book. I think it's satire, but it's what I do. I mean, here's the thing, like if you're in a field where you can't tell whether something is from it or it's city Oracle, right, then you need to lighten up about your field. Yes. And just gender studies in particular. Well yeah, in particular, but um,

Speaker 3:          00:52:31       but what is it about it that leans itself towards foolishness?

Speaker 2:          00:52:40       I think it's very hard to do good work in a field where you have to everyday systematically denying common sense and, and deny the evidence of your own eyes and ears about what's right in front of you. Like how sex differences work. I think that creates a habit of interacting with the world in a way that says what I study is going to beat completely divorced from every aspect of day to day life and everybody else I encounter who's not in my field. Because if, if you allow any crosstalk between like,

Speaker 5:          00:53:22       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:53:24       you're sort of blank slate, gender ideology and the real world, the ideology crumbles so you can, you can only maintain it behind this wall of, of insulation and that's a terrible position to be in. I don't envy the people who, who live their lives that way.

Speaker 4:          00:53:43       It all grows inside the walled gardens of academia and outside of that it's these, you know, you get Internet groups from people that sort of were indoctrinated into these ideas in, in college or, and it's also, I think in some ways there's a, a leveling of the playing field that a lot of these ideologies present some people where they, they go, no, you're not a freak. You're okay. You know this, there was some silly article on fat acceptance the other day and it was talking and they, then they got proposed, which is fine. I accept people who drink except I've except all kinds of unhealthy choices. But let's don't lie to me,

Speaker 2:          00:54:25       just

Speaker 4:          00:54:25       don't lie about the physical reality of what you've done to your body. If you reach 400 pounds, that's not, that's not healthy. You're saying it's healthy. You're saying it's okay. No, you're just not dead yet. If you lost 200 pounds, you would feel wonderful. That would be healthier. Like if you smoke every day and you're like, look, no, cancer smoking is healthy. No, no, you're just, you're just, your body is dealing with it. Your body's processing it. It won't be able to forever. That is exactly what's going on. If you're morbidly obese and for you to pretend any differently and to just go on about this fat acceptance movement and you know, the big beautiful this and that and like, no, you're obese. You've eaten too much food. If you see a fat guy, how come he doesn't get the same sort of treatment? If you see a morbidly obese man in his underwear, no one's saying he's beautiful because he's disgusting and he's fat and he's lazy and he's, he's addicted to food. We all know it. But if it's a woman, we're so inclined to like acts such as the care. Let her go. She's fine, you're wonderful, you're beautiful, you're amazing. Like kid give her her space, we treat them as if they're incapable of recognizing the absolute reality of their physical being.

Speaker 2:          00:55:45       I think it's important, you know, to address both the kind of individual choice level and also the kind of systemic level like the food industry and what is being promoted and what the federal government promoted for ages. And, um, it was this terrible situation where you could have followed exactly what the FDA recommended and it would have been bad for you for decades. And because of lobbying and because of the powers that be and an influence. And I think that's the level to criticize, right? If you have a systemic problem like promotion of tobacco products and you want to say for alternative, um, then yeah, you got to address the tobacco industry. We have this bizarre situation for example, um, where like a lot of people in my department work on alcoholism treatment research. How do you get people to drink less or they work on how do you get people to stop taking opiates?

Speaker 2:          00:56:52       How do you deal with opiate addiction? And if you make a suggestion like, oh, here's some awesome new research showing that if people switch from opiates to cannabis, it like dramatically lowers the risk of death. Or if they switch from alcohol to cannabis, it, it has all these health benefits relatively to like being an alcoholic, but it's kind of considered to bu to raise that and a lot of medicine and psychology and so forth. Well it's like, oh, you're, you're giving into people being self indulgent. If you say, they said they should switch from one thing to another in a kind of harm reduction mode, almost like Methadone type solution. Yeah. And a lot of them come out of a kind of 12 step program mentality where it's like you have a disease. If you ever do anything that is bad for you, then you've relapsed and that's feeding your disease.

Speaker 2:          00:57:51       I think that's idiotic. And that's not the evidence shows, that's not the way to treat any of these physical addictions. But, um, something like cannabis as an alternative is it's totally marginalized in academia. Like you really can't talk about it as a valid alternative where people could come home and they can drink or they could come home and they could get high and maybe getting high for a lot of people might be better. It's is that changing though? I haven't seen any evidence that it's changing, at least within academia really. I would think that that would be one of the first places where it does change because the influence of the pharmaceutical industry isn't so deeply entwined in the system itself. It's not like pharmaceutical industry. People are dropping off pamphlets on talking points when you're giving lectures. Well, here's the problem. Who gives you the research funding to look into this? Right? National Institute of Alcohol and alcoholism or National Institute of Drug Abuse. If you do a grant proposal that says here's an alternative that might work, they will shut it down because the federal government does not. Those agencies don't want to blow back of some senators saying, how dare you fund this research that says this is a valid alternative. Yeah. So everyone who works in these areas is kind of locked into a system

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       of, of grant funding that subject to kind of, um, political censorship by the funding agencies. Do you remember those? A talking dog commercials of about 10 years ago where there was a girl, she comes home from school and the dog's like, Lindsey really wish you wouldn't smoke putt. He not the same when you do. And I miss my friend and the girl sitting there stoned out of her mind, her dogs talking to her dog runs away. It turns out that the organization that funded those commercials was funded by tobacco, alcohol and pharmaceutical companies. Yeah. Like they're drug dealers who are against drugs. It's literally like hookers doing a commercial against strippers. That's literally what it's like. And we just accepted this and it was all over television. It was everywhere you look, it became parody and he became preposterous. It was like, this is your brain on drugs.

Speaker 1:          01:00:22       You remember the eggs and everybody's like, I'm hungry. I mean a meat million comedians had jokes on that. Give me the Munchies, man, this is just insanity that this is allowed to take place is that drugs that kill enormous numbers of people are allowed to demonize drugs that kill no one ever in the history of use. If you looked at that rationally, if you were something from some other planet that was studying the human race and you saw the way we program people and the way we spend enormous sums of money to project a certain idea and get it into people's heads through these very influential short, memorable videos, you'd be like, this is a culture and a civilization. Uh, uh, an org, an organism that is matt. This is madness. Yeah. I often asked myself, how is this going to look in 50 or a hundred years to whatever my, my great grandkids or future people who stumble upon my books or this podcast or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:01:31       And I think if this would make zero sense and would it be totally embarrassing both intellectually and ethically, then don't take it seriously and this particular issue, I think it's really important for citizens to understand how much of science is constrained by what can be funded by the federal government and that we are not actually supported to do certain kinds of research that might be really helpful to people. It's the same thing with sex research, right? It is virtually impossible to get federal funding to do any kind of sex research in America these days. So what do you do? You write a grant to do something else and then you kind of do this x research on the side using like some of the resources.

Speaker 2:          01:02:21       Um, I don't do this, but everybody I know does sex research does it,

Speaker 4:          01:02:25       is it because they're concerned that the image of funding sex research versus funding, whether it's obesity or hunger, poverty, whatever it is, these are, there's not enough resources to go around. Why would you spend any money studying this? You must be

Speaker 2:          01:02:44       pervert. It's partly that, but it's, it's partly, you know, the individuals in Washington who administer these grants don't want the political flack. If some politician discovers, oh, you're, you're doing funding on, on like how women can have more orgasms. Outrageous. Right. And it's like, that sounds like one of the most cost effective ways to increase human happiness I've ever heard of. Right. Right. But people are embarrassed of or glare embarrassed about it. Embarrassing of all sex. Yeah. Um, marital therapy, research you can do, like if you want to research, how do you make a monogamous relationship less full of stress and argument, you can get some money to do that. But even there, like the kind of suggestions you could make are quite restricted in terms of what, what kind of therapy you're allowed to, to research or talk about. So I, yeah, I wish citizens understood this because their tax dollars are not being allocated in the best way to deliver the benefits in their real lives to their families and their relationships that they, that they could do.

Speaker 4:          01:04:06       So to bring it all back to obesity. What, what I would like, and I bet I could say the same about you, is we'd like to take some of these sort of influential videos that we've seen done that demonize innocuous drugs like marijuana and put those on sugar. Put those on how upbeat people are addicted to sugar. People are addicted to so many things that are causing obesity. So many things that are causing us to have this epidemic of, you know what I mean? If you go to Disneyland, it's one of the saddest things in the world. You see how many people are on scooters because they've eaten themselves out of their ability to be mobile on their own. They're just overflowing out of the, off the side of these scooters. It's, it's very depressing and then you see them, what they're eating, they're drinking slushies and you know, eating fucking nonsense. And this, this is a, and again it's another addiction and in the availability of it is so, I mean, imagine if you were a heroin addict and everywhere you went has heroin. That's what it's like to be a sugar addict. If you're a sugar addict, every store you go into is filled with your drug every

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       seven 11 right when you go to pay for your gas or whatever you're doing, it's filled with your drug right there in front of you, your drugs everywhere. And you know, if, if you want to do something alternative, like I've been involved in the Paleo Movement for a few years and like my girlfriend's Vegan and if you want to find good Paleo or Vegan food, it's like getting a little easier. But it's not mainstream enough that there's like a whole island walmart devoted to it and this is a shitty I'll, yeah, so I don't know, the, the food system is a pretty hard nut to crack because there's an awful lot of money at stake and the profit margins on junk food are very, very high and it's also, it's very difficult to keep things on the shelf. Things go, I mean if you have real fresh food, it goes bad very quickly.

Speaker 1:          01:06:11       It's natural. That's what it's supposed to do. And Good luck keeping a supermarket open. If you could only keep your vegetables for a couple of days. Now if there was like long life Kale, I'd be pretty sad about that. But that would be sad. Like some sort of artificial turf type Kale and stuff goes bad quick, you know, it gets funky. Yeah. Um, but I, I'm kind of excited about new developments like clean meat, lunch meat. I am too, because I think like ethically that'll be awesome and we'll see what kind of monsters they make out of that. Yeah. It's going to be strange to see headless meat slabs, no central nervous system. Just grow and, and trying to figure out how do they get it to have like a muscle consistency, like a philemon yawn or something. I mean, you gotta realize an animal like different cuts of meat have a different texture to them because there's different muscle density because the animals use their body.

Speaker 1:          01:07:11       I think you'll have to electrically stimulate the muscles issue. So it kind of has to twitch and it's weird, but, and people go, Oh God, what did have nerves? That's disgusting. People would make the argument then that it could feel somehow or another in some neighboring dimension. It'll have like fake fake nerves. What I'm excited about is you could potentially have meat that's not just from like the top three species. You know, we could eat meat from people's pigs and chicken. Well, you can eat people, Jeffrey. Well, one of my edgier tweets was like celebrities will start selling pieces of themselves that can turn into like a Ryan gosling stake. If you don't want, encourage that bro. Trust me, Brian, don't go down that road. You're too delicious.

Speaker 1:          01:08:01       Yeah, man. I don't know about all that. I don't think we should encourage because what if people are delicious? That could be a real problem. I think the lab grown people always be cheaper than like, I don't know about that. Yeah, I bet. Could buy someone real cheap and some sort of third world country. Yeah. For food. You know, there was a terrible, not terrible in a bad way, but in terms of its revelations a, there's a documentary piece from vice on Liberia. And one of the things about it was that they were selling human meat and that, uh, this guy recognized it because he had eaten humans before. And so when there was a stand that was selling meat on the side of the road and he turned them in for selling human meat and the reason why he knew his cause he had eaten people.

Speaker 1:          01:08:47       I'm like, okay, when's the next flight out of here? What the Fuck Cube? Imagine. I mean, if you gave me a piece of lamb and he didn't tell me what it was, I'd be like, hmm. Not sure. Do you, how many people you have to eat before you absolutely know that somethings people like, fuck man, I had a lot of lamp chops, would not bet 100% on my ability to distinguished a lamb chop from say of a veal chop or a venison chop. But all of this stuff is going to create some real moral quandaries. Like there'll be this, uh, what Jonathan Haidt calls moral dumbfounding where you go, Yuck. That is disgusting. Why? I Dunno. It just is. Yeah. I can't give you a reason. Well, robot brothels, this is one of the more recent discussions, the ethical implications of robot brothels and there's a robot brothel that's scheduled to be open.

Speaker 1:          01:09:44       Where is that in Germany. Is that where it does? I believe, I believe it is. And there's all these people were up. Where's this Texas Holla powerful Texas, Texas. Dex Is, you could probably fuck a tiger if you've got enough money. Countries, first robot sex brothel set to open in Texas prompts backlash. See, I wonder if that's real or one of they just like a hey put out a fucking press conference to tell them we're going to open up a robot brothel. Let's let them go crazy. Is Ron White? He did it. Ron. When Ron White from his, from his off from the desk of Rod White it Austin, Texas. He said this email, 60 bucks for a half hour. Oh, that's cheap. How long does it take to get off with a robot? What did you lose your concentration set locations by 2020 is there a snooze button? 2020 so 18 months.

Speaker 1:          01:10:34       Yeah, but see what you don't want to show up late. Right? You don't want to be there at the end of the day. A bunch of unmotivated people cleaning out those fuck holes. Oh well of this was actually at the forefront of the lap dance club revolution in the late 80 [inaudible] the revolution there was a revolution. Well, yeah, from from old stripper style clubs. The lap dance where they actually touched you in. That actually started in the, in Texas. So either this is a show room where customers can test and rent dolls before deciding to purchase one. Ooh. He imagine, you know how like, uh, they have certain cars that had been, you know, on the lot for a while and like, are you thinking about buying an m for Mike Cologne? Take the

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       sucker for a spin.

Speaker 2:          01:11:16       Well, y'all should read the essay. My girlfriend Diana Fleischmann wrote about sex bots, which got her a little bit of notoriety a few months ago. What was her take on? It? Did it would be really good on balance because there's a lot of guys who, um, need, like a sexual release and if it kind of takes them away from doing some like exploiter to bill cosby style behavior into just doing something like this, which is kind of weird and gross but innocuous, like it's not hurting anybody, um, that, that would be a net win.

Speaker 3:          01:11:54       Do you make that connection because that, that's a, that's a tricky connection, right? Because most people who think of rape, they don't think of it as an act of arousal or sex or intimacy rather. It's a thing of power at some sort of a creepy, sociopathic, psychopathic behavior trait.

Speaker 2:          01:12:15       I know that's a standard view in gender feminism, but I don't think it's well supported by the evidence. Um, for example, there's a big problem with rape in India, right? And Porn as far as I understand, is illegal in India now accessible though? Or is it that you don't, I don't think it's even like, I think it's pretty hard to access porn websites from India, but I think if you legalized porn there, I predict the rate of sexual abuse would drop. Willing. Yeah, I really do. Boy, that would be a weird sort of experiment. But the thing about robots and sex is

Speaker 3:          01:12:58       they're going to get so good that it's going to be like a person and then we're going to be in this weird x Mokena sort of situation where, um, how would you feel? Like, what if you were dancing around with that really hot Japanese girl, an x Mokena she starts taking off your clothes. Like what do we do here? Like she feels warm. She's beautiful. She smells good like this. My, all my senses are telling me this is a person and she's a good listener. Yeah, she's pretty, she doesn't Nag you. She doesn't give a whole Nag. You owe you man. He man's planning. No, not yet.

Speaker 3:          01:13:31       That's my favorite. If you're correct and you have a penis, you're a mansplainer. Gotta be real careful about your information, the way you distribute it to two ladies these days. It used to be close to words being patronizing and you've got this to do it well. It also could be called being correct. Yeah. If sometimes you correct it just happened to be [inaudible] explaining true things as a crime. Well, when it comes to gender studies, we circle back to this, this, um, denial of reality. And we know that there's, there's this sort of really broad spectrum of sexuality in terms of male, female, in terms of, you know, in terms of the, the obvious, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:14:13       the rock on one side and Kate Upton on the other, right. You know, these Super Uber female, Uber, males. And then there's all these, like, who's the guy who was in the hobbit illogical? It's that guy he started in this sort of weird space in between the two of those people, right? And draw in this hobby. Well, he's not really androgynous, but in terms of like, you compare him to, you know, fill in the blank, Herschel Walker, it's not that manly, you know? And then there's, there's women that don't feel represented by these standard views of female sexuality as well. But this just speak to the variability of the human genome and it just, it just DNA in general. There's different people that breed with different people in different shapes come out until we figured out how to manipulate those shapes, which seems to be right around the corner with the robot fuck dolls.

Speaker 1:          01:15:05       It seems like they're both gonna arrive probably at the same time where you're going to be able to choose from, you know, having sex with a robot or having sex with the hulk. Like there's going to be real possibilities that everyone's going to look like thor. I mean, this seems like this is not too far away. One, two, three generations maybe, possibly inside of our lifetime will have mastered the human form to the point where the world's going to be preposterous and it's going to be like the Star Wars Cantina scene everywhere you go, oh yeah, well this is what happens whenever you have a biological innovation that opens up new possibilities in terms of the evolution of bodies or behaviors. As you get this adaptive radiation, this explosion of possibilities like the Cambrian explosion, right? 530 million years ago, animals finally figured out how do you program a multicellular body with a nervous system and as soon as they got that boom, you've got all this, these bizarre new forms, and then you get, you know, dinosaurs and mammals in us.

Speaker 1:          01:16:07       I think once we can program the human genome and you have parents who are like, I want, I want to select for kids who were like really tall and really religious, right? And other parents are like, I want cute little hobbit babies who are like hardcore atheist with furry feet and then you'll, you'll get a divergence. Imagine if your parents decided to make you a Hobbit, like they could have done anything they want. Remember like the first early adopters, I imagine it's going to be about fetal transformation, about taking something that's in the womb and manipulating it, and then as it emerges and evolves and grows, then you're gonna see what it is. If you fucking parents were just gigantic Jrr tolkien fans and you have heard furry feet and two feet tall, you're like, what the fuck mom? Like you asshole. I just wanted a hobbit. I did want to pay me like who's either a hobbit or a cave troll, so you should call your boss. Yeah, that's entirely possible.

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       I think the, I think the sex bots will come a lot quicker. Yeah. I think we're going away. What do we look like? What do we look like right now in terms of sex bots? What are we looking at? Let's say state of the art type? Google state of the art sex robot started talking to and see what they have there in Texas. I think they look pretty good, but they're not. They're not good at. We're good at like language or conversation with eye contact or handjobs movement or whatever, but I think there will be this tipping point where they can do conversation. That's good enough. Right. It doesn't have to be quite as smart as an actual lover, but it can be a hell of a lot nicer than an actual lover. It can have better memory for all your preferences and your desires and your and like it will also be more trainable in terms of it'll kind of register. Oh the last time I asked this question like you didn't respond much, but this other question you talked for five minutes. I'll ask more of that. Mm. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:18:13       This is all very problematic behavior discussing here Jeffrey. Well like your tone, trainable. Well my girlfriends, sometimes people are nice when you're nice to them. Jeffrey, how about you? Be Nice. First set of expecting this fucking robot to just take care of your Dick and balls and just be nice to you all the time and remember all the stuff you like. What about it? He would develop into total narcissist, sociopath with robots that we could just get to do whatever we want. We bring them to the mall on a leash.

Speaker 2:          01:18:45       Well, so there are two different ways I could go. Right, right. On the one hand, like if there's a woman I'm interested in let's say, and she has access to a male sex bot who's like really funny cause it's like it's a little neural network has learned like all of your standup routines or um, how to, how to riff on today's news and, and it's a great listener and it remembers everything about her backstory. I can either be like, I can't compete with that. I'll have to dis it. I'll have to say you're not allowed to see him anymore or all have to level up and be better. Yes. Well like, like humans and I, I hope people will level up and I'm well yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:19:38       And we'll get to see, we'll learn from the people don't level up like how they fall apart. I present you with an even more disturbing scenario.

Speaker 6:          01:19:47       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:19:48       Some people will be like, you know that Jeffrey Miller is a handsome guy. I like to fuck them all the time and they gonna make a version of you and bring it around the mall with a leash on and you're going to be going to the apple store and a version of you. It was going to be kicked and come with a dog collar on standing right next to you

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       while you're buying a new Mac book. And you're like, what the fuck? And it's going to be totally legit cause you don't look at, Oh whoa. That's what it looked like. Swappable face. Let me see what it looks like though. This is just, this is, this is like when you're looking at one of them digital renderings of a house they haven't built yet. Let's see what we got here. Pouch. Are they warm? Whoa. The all these closeups or creeped me out. Come on. Get Ai. It's Howard Stern. Hey, leave this. Oh that's creepy. They haven't passed the uncanny valley. Clearly that, yeah, it was hairy chest. What the fuck? Oh, it's a guy. Robot video. A long video. Yeah. I mean people will do like celebrity, deep fake sex bots on, there will be people wandering around with their Jordan Peterson Sax bought on a leash and the store will have you seen the porn where they do face swaps.

Speaker 4:          01:21:03       That's, that's getting really good. They're really good at that. Now this is another social revolution we're going to have to brace for as an Arrow when you can do a credible porn fake of any celebrity or any citizen. Yeah, just based on like sampling their facebook photos or do you know who kyle done again is hilarious. Standup comedian who has the funniest instagram page of all time and his instagram page is about 80% of him doing face swap videos of the Kardashians and president trump and Kanye west and with it just so fucking ridiculous because you know that they're fake because it's real obvious that they fake, but it's essentially like a new art form. If you think of like sketch comedy and here play one forum, see what we got here. This is a good one.

Speaker 5:          01:21:50       Yeah. Big Job. What I do know when I was at your tiny White House, I put a recorder in the chat. Yeah, yeah, she'd be, yeah, yeah. Holy Shit. Another day. Yeah, the bathroom, the House we had, oh by God, she's got the weirdest ass, but also sorta terrific. Esoteric a been a spell speller. Chair. Hello. Some information here. Okay. She had a bell a little bit about an hour and a half ago. That's what we had tech, but totally datcher that she's on her period. Light flow day, maybe day three. God, yeah. Yeah. That dead chicken by buddy lilly. He's realistic though. Died. We just tried to open up this shit. Paid bottle. Just celebrate by retruded coby.

Speaker 4:          01:22:51       So this kind of stuff, but see what I love about this is it's so obvious. You know, it's, it's, this is essentially, I mean most he has them out of the little sketches that he does on his instagram page, but most of his stuff is this face thing,

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       which is, I mean, relatively new technology. When one was face swap invented less than a decade ago or so on your phone. Yeah, that good. Pretty soon, just a few years, and it's become this new form of comedy, of sketch comedy, you know, and and with a guy like him, he was such a good impressionist, you know, but this is crude and obvious and how long is it going to be before someone can actually, I mean they already have that machine that a lot of the technology that allows you to take, especially someone like me who's talked for countless hours, you take your voice, you take all of the recordings that I've ever done, this more than a thousand podcasts. You throw them into this machine and you basically have all my various inflections, anger, sadness, laughter or giddiness, perplexed, all the different words that I have in my vernacular, and you put them all into this thing and you can kind of morph it around. It's photoshop for voice, so you have the video where you can face swap and manipulate people's images and it's getting better and federal at the time. Then you have photoshop for voice. You can essentially make movies with people where they just do whatever you want them to do.

Speaker 2:          01:24:19       Yeah. It'll be pretty soon, totally impossible to tell a fake audio recording from real and yeah. And then fake video from real. And what do we do then? It means we can't really trust digital records of people in the same way. Um, it also means you can, I don't know, it might be good. I mean, it means you can digitally sample anybody who's a good communicator and they can do an unlimited number of, I mean, you could have David Attenborough, you know, natural history videos forever, even after he's dead.

Speaker 3:          01:24:58       Right. But he could also be doing Nazi propaganda videos as well. Yeah. That's what's really weird. You could essentially, it would be up to the user. Yeah. So someone like kyle done again, but an evil version could take David attenborough and, you know, yeah. You can do whatever you want. Well, almost like what we're saying about communication that you, this open floodgate of communication. We're learning how to manage all the implications of this. It's really recent. Yeah. And I think with, um, human relationships, you know, we'll have to figure out kind of ethically

Speaker 2:          01:25:37       once, let's say once somebody can make like a deep fake video porn of their ex lover. Right. Right. And then the wife wife catches them watching it. Right. Okay. Or, um, you know, the wife buys a sex Bot and it's like keeps it at work. Okay. Like

Speaker 3:          01:26:00       she didn't come home from work exhausted, all busted

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       up and like, I just want to watch ozark. I don't want to hear anyone talk to you. One of her shoes broken fucking happened. Yeah. Is that cheating? Yeah. Some people think that, I mean, some people think looking at porn is cheating. There's that argument. I mean there's, people have standards vary varying levels of standards

Speaker 2:          01:26:27       and they don't negotiate it. They don't talk about it. This is something my friend David Ley points out in his book, um, ethical porn for decks, which is about responsible porn viewership for men. Hmm. That, like if you're in a relationship with a woman and you're a straight guy, you need to have the talk about what is your girlfriend. Consider cheating in terms of porn watching. Most guys don't have the guts to have that conversation. Most women don't either. And then

Speaker 4:          01:26:56       there is it the guts or you don't want to open up that door. It just keep it on the sneak tip. She can't complain and then no one knows nothing. And then we're all good. Everybody finds out yes and mile and you go to the movies and y'all hold hands Jeffrey and everything's fine and he keeps push the secrets to the grave. Shut down into the why you're watching that Romcom you think of someone with a ball gag tied up in a basement covered in baby oil, right? Yeah. Some people into a happy place. I'll have to go there. You got to go there all day sometimes.

Speaker 2:          01:27:31       Yeah. So the people have to talk about this stuff like that, like grownups. And as the technology keeps advancing, right and becomes more and more, you know, the line between like

Speaker 4:          01:27:48       porn and real life gets fuzzier. And fuzzier right with robots and virtual reality is going to be very strange. I think that probably what's going to happen is there's going to be some sort of a merger between virtual reality and robots like that would be like the, the real ultimate brothel. So you wouldn't be as confused by the uncanny valley because there's so much closer in a visual sense of replicating that. I'm sure you've seen like some of the more recent video games like God of war and a bunch of these like really high end games. The graphics are so intense, especially in the um, you know, the little scenes that they do, whether they're there, have promo clips and stuff. He looked at it like, is this real end game video that I'm looking at these, this is insane. It looks like I'm watching a movie. Yeah. That this in combination like some sort of real four k age d virtual reality in combination with a sex robot is probably where people are going to go.

Speaker 2:          01:28:52       Yeah, I think so. Um, and then the other question is like what happens with that technology in terms of education and college and how people acquire skills and knowledge and insight? Um, it's really, really hard to imagine that people still think in 15 years. Okay. Going to a physical classroom and sitting, you know, listening to the average community college like adjunct professor talking about human sexuality or gender feminism or political science that they'll think that's a state of the art. That's the way we should do that. And, and then what happens? I mean it seems kind of unlikely that university is, as we know them, will keep existing in anything close to their current form. And yet no one's talking about this. Um, uh, like I wouldn't be that surprised if half the universities in America go bankrupt within 15, 20 years.

Speaker 4:          01:29:56       So do you think that people are going to be getting their education and some sort of an online form, some sort of virtual classroom form or some maybe new, not yet created version,

Speaker 2:          01:30:08       some new virtual reality form that's a lot more interactive? I don't think it will be just watching videos and then taking quizzes. Have you paid attention to what Elon Musk has been saying about as neuro link? A bit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think about what you've heard so far? I think it will be very, very hard technically to do that. Um, but what, what do you know about it? Um, if you could explain it to people that don't know what we're talking about, if I understand correctly, having watched like you interview Ilan, et Cetera. Um, he's just concerned that the bandwidth that connects the brain to the world or the brain to the Internet is quite narrow. Like you can get a lot of information quickly through your eyes and ears, but your speed of like typing and controlling things is, we're speaking is, is kind of limited.

Speaker 2:          01:31:00       So I think there's a push to kind of open up that that bandwidth and the speed of communication between the human brain and digital reality and other people, if they figured out a way to do that, it's a total game changer. Um, in terms of how people interact with not just social media but in general with each other. I mean it means basically you have a global telepathy system if you want and then everything changes because it means the ease with which one part of my brain communicates with another part isn't that much higher than the ease with which that part communicates with somebody else's other brain part.

Speaker 4:          01:31:52       What I've been thinking about is some sort of universal language in that if that's, if they bridge the gap between cultures and civilizations and w the way people communicate and doing so do it through some sort of a digital interface and instead of like very simple characters that equal words that you put into your linguistic disc dictionary and you have an understanding of what this person's talking about. Instead of that you get like real clear concepts, maybe even like an Emoji form or hieroglyphic form or some sort of form where we figure out over x amount of years how to communicate through agreed upon imagery or agreed upon data in some sort of a way that it lets people express emotions and perhaps even more engrossing and more complicated than the actual language that we're enjoying right now.

Speaker 2:          01:32:46       Yeah, it'll, it'll be amazing. I mean the evolutionary backstory to this, right, as you basically have the whole history of life on earth, you know, before humans invent language where animal communication is pretty primitive. Like all you really have at the most complicated as like nightingale's producing complicated bird song to track mates. That's about as much as you get.

Speaker 4:          01:33:12       What about like chimps that have certain sounds for tigers and other sounds for eagles

Speaker 2:          01:33:16       that have like a maximum of maybe a dozen different sounds. Um, but with human language it compared to that, it really is suddenly like having telepathy where you can communicate so much, so quickly, so efficiently and yet, um, you know, of neuro link works, it would be as far in advance of language as languages of kind of animal signaling. Whoa. And it's hard. It's hard to imagine what that world looks like because

Speaker 7:          01:33:50       yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:33:51       You know, imagine a form of twitter where it's not just through your, you know, your thumbs on a key pad, but it's a direct brain interface. And then when people, it's not just saying something mean or stupid, it's even thinking something meaner, stupid that could immediately get posted. And once you kind of start sharing your whole subconscious with people through neurolink, then well, you know, we'll have to level up with some new social norms about what, what that means and sort of how much radical honesty we can take from each other.

Speaker 4:          01:34:38       That seems to be where the future is. The complete desolving of all boundaries between people and information people and their lives and that some sort of a, uh, a way of recording your actual experiences or letting people share them in real time. Like imagine if people decided to let people through some virtual reality scenario put on headsets and experience. You are having sex with your girlfriend. You say, hey, we're going to fuck on periscope. Come on, join in. And everybody just puts on their neuro link and their augmented reality headset and they put on their haptic feedback suit, which is, you know, now and you know, like iphone 10 level, you know, you'd go back to iphone once, piece of shit, haptic feedback, 10, it's going to be incredible. It's going to be silky smooth. It's going to feel like real touch and they're going to be able to have sex along with you. You can have a digital orgy.

Speaker 2:          01:35:42       Yeah. I think that's coming within 50 years. Maybe earlier.

Speaker 4:          01:35:47       That's a very conservative guess. Yeah. 100% is come up there. There it is. Jesus Christ. Jamie, there's a haptic feedback system looking around in there. What is this? It? Oh this couple sexy as fuck to take your clothes off folks. Why are you wearing these goofy outfits? Pretend you superheroes. What do you, uh, what are these things for? Climate control systems, biometric systems, motion capture and avatar system. Boy, we're fucked. Jeffrey Vr, ar and Mr. So this is all happening while we're chit chatting about it, these people have already engineered it

Speaker 2:          01:36:23       and society is going to be totally blindsided by this. Yeah, cause everybody thinks, oh well I saw it on Black Mirror but I know that it's not even my like so I don't have to worry about it and minoration yet, cause it's only science fiction. Like

Speaker 4:          01:36:38       you said, something on Sam Harris has show that gave me a little bit of hope that turned out to not be true. Okay. He sits up that you were talking about asteroids about our ability to recognize asteroids and, and stop the impact. Nope. According to Neil degrasse Tyson, we need at least 10 years. We need to know that they're 10 years, they're going to hit in 10 years and then maybe we could do something that's not comforting, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          01:37:01       Well. Okay, here's the thing. It would be really good to invest at least a few tens of billions of dollars in doing that for sure as insurance, but like the probability of a significant asteroid impact within the next century is pretty low. If I understand it correctly. I think he's just guesswork.

Speaker 4:          01:37:22       Does motherfuckers just whizz by all the time? Yeah, it's the probability of us getting hit eventually is 100%

Speaker 2:          01:37:33       yeah, it'll happen probably in a few million years, but,

Speaker 4:          01:37:38       but why do you say that? Is that to make yourself feel better? I'll be long gone.

Speaker 2:          01:37:42       It'll be my great quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. Great. Great, great. Great grandchildren have to worry about that. Well, you got to play the odds, right? I mean we could, we, we could be exterminated by a gamma ray burst from like a Supernova at any time with zero with no warning. But it's pretty unlikely. And it hasn't happened before in the history of life on earth.

Speaker 4:          01:38:05       Right. But it happens constantly. All throughout the universe. There was a documentary I watched once the freak me the fuck out. It was all about hyper Novas and they were talking about when they first started discovering them that they were really actually concerned that there was a war going on in space. And then they, they recognize that all these explosions were happening all day long and they thought there was a war going on in the cosmos, which is really fascinating because I think this is like when they just got, I want to say it as a sixties and they discovered this. Does that make sense?

Speaker 2:          01:38:40       In a way, it's kind of surprising that we haven't seen evidence of that happening already. Right. I mean, when, when I wrote my piece about the Fermi Paradox, which is why don't we have evidence of aliens already? My solution was basically, well, most species that are intelligent, that invent technology get wrapped up in video games and virtual reality and sex technology and it just distracts them and they kind of dropped the ball on staying alive and exploring anything. And, um, I think it's still quite likely that that happens to most intelligent species that they just kind of disappear up their own buttholes

Speaker 4:          01:39:21       yeah. Or they create some sort of an artificial life form that's far more advanced than anything that it's biological and has no desire, need or, uh, no instincts to reproduce. And if you, if we see, I mean, I've, I've said this to many times that I think that we are essentially some sort of a, some sort of, uh, electronic caterpillar that gives birth to a technological butterfly. And we're making a coon right now. We don't know what we're doing. And we're about to create artificial life. And then we're doing it through our intense desire for innovation. Constantly want newer, better things, whether it's televisions and cars or phones were never like that. This one's perfect. Let's just stop here. Never. The desire is always towards every, you know, fill in the time period. We want a new version, a better version with improvements. And we keep getting those. And this is what fuels in many ways, it fuels our desire for me. Materialism, materialism. IMBA is embodied by technological innovation. I mean what you're always wanting when you get past jewels, you always want the newest, greatest innovations. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:40:30       I think at a certain point humanity's going to have to bite the bullet and say we should plan which innovations come first, what happens next. And we might even have to have like regulation or social taboos that say we really shouldn't go down that path until we do this other thing first. That makes us ready to do that thing in a safer, more rational, more ethical.

Speaker 4:          01:40:57       Yeah. But that's the big word, right? Rational like we're not really rational and competition, especially when it's a dealing with different countries that have different human rights laws and standards of behavior and thinking, well this is a problem with regulating like artificial intelligence is how'd you get China to play ball? That was going to say China, I didn't want to seem racist. Well they're going to do it. And Russia too. I mean I'm already doing it.

Speaker 2:          01:41:24       China's a threat because they are smart and organized and future oriented and they can do long term planning and

Speaker 4:          01:41:30       technologically they're incredibly advanced. I mean, so, so far advanced. So we're, or this government rather it's trying to keep the best phones from China, from getting to America.

Speaker 6:          01:41:42       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:41:43       Yeah. I mean Huawei probably has some pretty close links to the Chinese millage.

Speaker 4:          01:41:50       It does, right? Yeah. It does. To the Chinese government. Communist dictatorship. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:41:55       And of course it's a lovely system if Huawei phones how backdoors it allowed the Chinese to learn a lot about Americans and our culture and our communication. And that's the concern. Um, it's, that's actually more of a concern to me than like, um, military spying in the strict sense. Cause I think China has so many people working on cyber warfare that we probably don't even have any idea what their capabilities are. But I think if they have insight into like, here's the American psyche and here's how their political thinking works, it will be quite a bit easier to kind of manipulate, um, in terms of our geopolitics because we don't have anything analogists I think, where like, is the Pentagon trying to figure out how could we nudge Chinese social media use? You don't think they know our interests. I'd be surprised if they're doing it well.

Speaker 4:          01:43:01       Well, what's fascinating is Google's take on China is that they're willing to censor video or internet searches because they feel like if they don't try to just going to copy their technology and do it anyway, and so this way, at least they're in there. I'm like, boy, that's a sketchy way of sort of absolving yourself. Yeah. Of any bad feelings about censorship. You're, you're contributing to censorship. Government issued censorship. Yeah, because you want to control the market and we're going, oh yeah, well, you know, I can't Google Tiananmen Square. You literally can't Google Tiananmen Square.

Speaker 2:          01:43:43       It seems like there's a huge difference between China's authoritarian regime and the American political system, but I think they're not quite as different as a lot of folks think. Like if you talk to Chinese academics about like what can you research and what can you not research, like they have different constraints than Americans do. But on at the pragmatic level, there are certain topics that they can address that we can't and vice versa. So it's not like there's just one dimension of freedom and we're better than them on, on every aspect of it. And I, again, I think American citizens have no idea how restricted American scientists are and kind of what we're allowed to study.

Speaker 4:          01:44:29       Oh, we're going to talk about loud too, or what you can get grants and approval for. And is that the same thing as allowed to effectively it's the same thing because you, if you don't have any funding, you're not going to, there's no study.

Speaker 2:          01:44:41       You can't do science without money. Right. Um, and in fact, like if I was starting my career again at this point, I wouldn't go into academia. If I wanted to understand human behavior, I would go work for facebook or Google because they have much more data about human behavior than I could ever get as a scientist. Are they doing that? I'm sure they're doing it, but we don't know what they're finding because they don't publish journal papers. It's all, it's all commercial secrets. So what I'm sure that like facebook understands a lot more about social psychology then social psychology does at this point. Really? Yeah. How could they not? They have like 1.2 billion people interacting socially regularly and they data mine to hell out of that for commercial purposes.

Speaker 4:          01:45:39       Right. But are they publishing things? Are they sharing this information? Don't turn it all. I'm sure it's all internal. But internally, do you think they're publishing things?

Speaker 5:          01:45:49       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:45:50       I dunno. That's the thing. Yeah. Um, it's just a little bit alarming when this state of the art in understanding behavior isn't public.

Speaker 4:          01:46:01       That is alarming. And then Mark Zuckerberg might be a robot to, right. Everybody's worried about that might be a Spec spot. We've, we played many times a video of him drinking water. I don't know, Dude. He drinks water like that creepy little fuck. It's a just kidding mark. Don't delete my account. Um, I think that we're, we're looking at in terms of like Google and facebook and twitter and even youtube, we're looking at these enormous organizations that I don't think they had any idea what they were going to be. You know? And I, I really particularly feel that way about twitter. When twitter first started out, do you remember how it used to be like you would use like you're at like at Miller is enjoying a cup of coffee. Yeah. You, you would talk about yourself in the third person. It was really weird, you know, uh, at Jamie Vernon is going to the movies.

Speaker 2:          01:46:59       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:46:59       And that's how people talked the early days of [inaudible] and then people realize what the fuck am I doing?

Speaker 8:          01:47:05       You had, that's sort of the reason it developed it because there was no group tech texting back then in 2007 or six when it started. So it was developed for group texting so you could share what you were doing with a group of your friends. Was that what it was for? They opened it so that more people could follow if you wanted to. And then celebrities jumped on and then it, and they, like, they started adding the ability people just started doing at Joe Rogan. So they'd added the ability to, to click that and share it and tag it. Yeah. So weird.

Speaker 4:          01:47:35       And then you think about it now, now it's a vehicle for the president to threaten other countries

Speaker 2:          01:47:40       and it is the, it's the global public forum and particularly in America, it is that the public square where everyone shares ideas and,

Speaker 4:          01:47:48       well, it's a less verbose version of facebook. The problem with facebook is you just can write too much. I can't keep up with you, bro. And I like the really, really ridiculous people who just paragraph after paragraph of run on sentences with no, no editing at all. Like ugh.

Speaker 2:          01:48:06       Yeah, it's a lot about, here's a very long story about my most recent emotional trauma or I dunno if anybody ever is like having a breakup or divorce on facebook. You're like, Oh man, now I'm going to have to listen.

Speaker 4:          01:48:20       Stop for a few months. Yeah. And then they reach out hoping some people say it's going to be okay, mark, everything's fine. Life moves on. You're going to forget about her eventually. It's just, and people keep going back to who's, who's left a comment.

Speaker 2:          01:48:38       Yeah, yeah. Maybe she liked it. Maybe she's changed her mind, but it, it, I mean it is very kind of funny and interesting that nobody predicted 15 years ago exactly how humans would make use of this new technology. Yeah. Like nobody in psychology was talking about, oh, twitter is going to radically transform the way that science operates. For example, news of like failed replications will be spread within three days to everybody in a field. And anybody who does scientific misconduct will be suddenly like pushed out within a week or a new result will be shared globally within 24 hours. Nobody was thinking about that. So there's like signs, twitter, politics, twitter, entertainment, twitter, and they've all kind of changed the game and their respective fields. Um, and we didn't understand human nature well enough to predict how people actually use the stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:49:51       Yeah. We did. Just didn't see it coming either.

Speaker 9:          01:49:53       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:49:54       I mean, no one ever would. I remember when Ashton Kutcher was in some sort of a race with someone else, I want to say to get to a million followers, wasn't it like a million? Yeah. And everybody thought that's crazy. He's going to have a million followers. I don't even think he's on twitter anymore. He's not. But his account is hilarious. It's like a production company now or something. Yeah. And gave it to system fucking too dangerous.

Speaker 2:          01:50:22       And now what? Katy Perry has like 120 minutes.

Speaker 4:          01:50:26       Yeah. Something insane. Probably more. And then you've got to go to her instagram, which is probably even bigger than that. It was racing CNN and Brittany Spears. Oh Wow. Okay. Here's the article for a million. Look at that twitter race to a million, what years at 2009. Wow. Twitter raise to a million followers can cut your beat. CNN and spears. That's hilarious. No one even knew what it meant back then.

Speaker 2:          01:50:51       So I mean with the virtual reality work or the neuro link, right. We're going to have those things. We'll probably have a beginner impact on culture and society. Even then twitter did. Yeah. And still people are kind of just sleepwalking into that, that world sleepwalking with a few hesitant observers on the outside warning,

Speaker 4:          01:51:17       like almost like standing back, like watching someone play with fireworks. Like, okay, Hey, um, do you know what's going to happen when you light that garbage can on fire? It's filled with dynamite

Speaker 2:          01:51:31       and the legal issues or privacy issues that the impact on relationships. Yeah. Um, is okay, so like we train a lot of PHD's in clinical psychology in my department and a lot of them are going to deal with people and their relationships and their marriages and the conflicts and arguments and whatever. Are we training them for a future world where they're going to have to deal with sex bots and virtual reality and new forms of social media and new kinds of basically telepathy that are foreign advance of human language. No or not. But that's, that's the world that they're going to spend their professional lives in.

Speaker 4:          01:52:15       Isn't it similar in some ways? I mean, Jamie, you could speak to this, you were trained as an audio engineer and now everything's like all the software that was available when you were learning is just useless now. Honestly, it wasn't even youtube when I went to school. So a lot of the, uh, if anyone has questions now you can learn almost everything. I learned in the Year of program I had in a week if you need it to, you just don't get the hands on application and touched on this stuff. But

Speaker 8:          01:52:46       yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       but people that went to school for video editing and all the other different systems

Speaker 8:          01:52:51       detailed, detailed from anyone you want to watch now almost because they even had like the master class, you could learn screenwriting from Aaron Sorkin. It learn directing from Hawaii. Yeah. Ron Howard or whatever it is. You didn't have that 10 years ago.

Speaker 4:          01:53:04       Yeah. And then in terms of financial, I mean the, the amount of financial strain that getting the traditional education puts on people and they get out of school and they're saddled with this debt that is also, you can't even absolve it if you declare bankruptcy, which is kind of hilarious when you think of the dirty shit that banks do and Wall Street does and all the risks they take and all the chaos that they have created from their shitty decisions that have affected the entire economy and they're absolved. But yet some kid who wanted to get a gender studies degree and now as a quarter million dollars, some fucking halfassed Michigan University.

Speaker 2:          01:53:47       I think it's unconscionable. Yeah, it's terrible. I mean, I feel really morally conflicted about working in an industry that I think is pretty exploitative and a lot of ways.

Speaker 4:          01:53:58       Yeah, I was going to ask you about that. Like what, what's the stance that you take? I mean if, if a kid comes to you and says, you know, I don't know what to do here.

Speaker 2:          01:54:10       I mean generally the stance I take, so in, in a way I'm, I'm lucky because I work at a large state public university and tuition is really pretty. Do you want to say which one it is that people at University of New Mexico, um, and it's great. We serve 40,000 students and we charge very, very little tuition money compared to most places because it state subsidized and if you keep up a certain grade point average, it's about as close to free as you can, you can get in America. So I don't feel like we're as economically exploitative as if I was like teaching at Middlebury college or Yale or whatever. But still, um, you know, of undergrads come to me and they go, what, what should I learn? What should I major in? What classes should I take? The only real advice I can give is like take stuff that's going to be useful in your life, your personal life, no matter what career you do.

Speaker 2:          01:55:10       Mm. So you should take my human sexuality class cause you'll probably be a sexual being for the rest of your life and you'll be in relationships of some sort or another. You should learn about, um, politics. You should learn about the history of civilization. You should learn about animal behavior and biology and all that stuff. But don't expect that. Like you can major in pharmacy and then get a job as a pharmacist that makes a hundred k out of the gate because that might be automated. Don't assume you can go to law school and you'll make bank like your dad did. Because a lot of that like, um, document discovery is being automated. Don't assume you're going to be a surgeon because that might be roboticized. So I just say you should try to get a classical liberal arts education that, that equips you as a citizen and as a person and as a, um, an ethical being a and that's the future proof way to do it.

Speaker 4:          01:56:19       And even then, there's a distinct possibility that this education or a superior version of it will be available through some new unfound or soon to be discovered form.

Speaker 2:          01:56:30       Yeah. And just expect that you will, if you stay curious throughout your life, you'll be able to learn about as much, you know, in every four to six years going forward as you learned in this four to six years of college. That's right.

Speaker 4:          01:56:47       What's interesting is that no one really thinks of a university education as being something that equips you for life, that your, your learning so that you can just, you're, you're just educating yourself and to sort of make your mind more available possibilities and options and

Speaker 2:          01:57:07       causes and effects. And just, just for your own edification that that's, this is not a consideration. People think I need a career. Uh, I don't want to go to this college for four years. When I get out, I want to kick ass job cause I want to buy Alexis or whatever it is. My favorite students, honestly, are the mature students. It's the vets about a couple of tours in Iraq or Afghanistan and come back to college and they have life experience and they're like here because they really want to learn, not because the parents think it's the right thing to do. Or even in my human sexuality class, I get, uh, grandparents in their sixties and seventies sometimes. Really? Yeah. Grand Pan. They're great because they've actually had like 50 or marriages, so they know a little something about, wow, you know, psychology and it's not for their career. It's not for the status. It's because they really want to be there and they want to learn. Well, I would also imagine they're not as filled with angst as an eight

Speaker 4:          01:58:08       18 year old first escape from the family nest and is not understanding what to do with their freedom and

Speaker 2:          01:58:17       so many distractions. They're there just to educate, educate themselves. Yeah, they're there. They're less neurotic. They're more confident. Um, they call me out on my bullshit sometimes today. Oh yeah. Like, like what bullshit. Um, well, the horrifying thing now of if you're teaching a class is you can make a factual claim and any student can check it on, on while I'm talking while you're talking. And of course the 20 year old won't raise their hand and go, that's wrong. Put the grandmas will grandma's well, yeah. Hilarious. So yet you have to, what do you even call that on? Okay. So there was a book back in 99 called, uh, I think the technology of orgasm that made the claim that vibrators were first invented in the Victorian era, the late 18 hundreds to help doctors bring their female patients to orgasm to cure quote hysteria. And for 20 years that was sort of accepted as, oh yeah, that's a good historical analysis of that situation. And then that got totally debunked in the last few months by other historians. Look, the last few months I've been telling people that forever. I know I

Speaker 4:          01:59:42       kai had to, and what's the reality? They didn't really, doctor, you didn't finger back. There's no evidence at all that that was going on. I would think that that would be a thing that Gal's wouldn't want to let go. If there was a place we could go or the doctor definitely knew how to work it. You give you an orgasm, there'd be a line around the block, frustrated ladies, you would, you would, you would think it would have left it there in print. I would not just that, why would it stop? Why would the doctor say, you know what, this business is just too goddamn lucrative and my hands are tired. Closing up shop. I got carpal tunnel. I can't even type anymore.

Speaker 2:          02:00:20       Yeah. And the women are like, yeah, how would that go away? So it was no evidence of who invented that. I can't remember the name of the author of that. Um, it even got made into a movie hysteria. Right?

Speaker 4:          02:00:32       The job nobody wanted. Is that a book? Oh yeah. There we go about it from the New York Times based off the book. Or this might actually be from the book. And what year is this? I don't, this might be the book. I don't know. Yeah, I think that's it. It, so is this like sorta like that killer's sperm theory that people still to this day recite, even though there's no evidence whatsoever that's prime as any other function other than impregnating and egg? Yeah. There's a lot of kind of urban myths. That's a big one though. There was a whole book written about, about different kinds of berm. Yeah. Sperm wars attacks Berm. Yeah. That would kill other sperm

Speaker 2:          02:01:11       Baker and bellis back in the early nineties and those guys are assholes. It was a beautiful theory, but like nobody could replicate it and it just didn't work.

Speaker 4:          02:01:22       Oh, I thought it was a little pac man's sperm of their attack. Another sperm. Right. They called it what? Kamikaze sperm. Is that what they call it? Yeah, the sperm that allegedly were specialized to, yeah. I remember someone brought that up to me and I, I, uh, I read it and I went, oh boy, I don't know about that. How smaller

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       sperm. So there's not a lot of room in there for other functions. Like how are they even getting those other sperm and killing them? Like, what's, what are they using? They have acid, like the alien. What are they doing? They rotten little ied. Yeah. What are they doing?

Speaker 5:          02:01:56       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:01:57       they have an acrosome reaction. Like there is a tiny little warhead that like helps her get into the egg a warhead.

Speaker 2:          02:02:05       Well it's some enzymes that are pretty good at that kind penetrating yeah. Digesting their way in. But yeah, that's an example of urban myth, um,

Speaker 1:          02:02:18       published urban myth published. I mean at the time it was plausible but it kinda got debunked fairly quickly. So it was this sort of just a sensational sort of an article that someone wrote or the book that they did, they just say, hey, let's just fake this in order to sell a lot of books and get people excited about our work. I don't think they faked it. I think they may, they slightly old oversold it, but they, like, they did have some proper journal paper publications that were peer reviewed and that made sense at the time. And like I used to teach that stuff cause I believe that. Oh yeah. How'd you teach it? Like, what, what was the, what was the conventional way of describing this conventional story was

Speaker 2:          02:03:07       people think we evolved to be in monogamous, long term pair bonds, but here's some evidence that humans do extra pair copulations that they sometimes go outside the relationship. If that happens, then there's occasional sperm competition where a woman mates with more than one guy during one ovulatory cycle. So that potentially ejaculates from two different guys could be in a reproductive track competing to fertilize same ag. If that happens, the sperm would be under selection to be good at being fast, fighting off the other sperm, um, making the reproductive tract more hostile to any guy who comes after you, et Cetera, et cetera. So it was kind of like a way of challenging the assumption of monogamous mating and pointing out women have this sexual freedom and agency that was not fully recognized. And the result is men have to compete more, like not just physically, uh, not just for status speeding and even at this kind of biochemical level.

Speaker 2:          02:04:23       And it all made sense, right? We could have been that species, but as it turned out, um, the rates of extra pair copulation or infidelity or actually pretty low and a lot of societies like it's not like 20% of kids are sired by some guy other than their dad. It's like mostly well under two or 3%. Right. But we're talking about now. Yeah. But in, in comparison to when all of this stuff evolved, we could be talking about humans of 50, 60,000 years ago. Yeah. Which is a totally different ballgame. It is different. And if, if we'd been a species with like a lot of sperm competition, then our testicles would be as big as chimp testicles. Right. That's what's interesting, right. That when it comes, there's a direct correlation between the number of promiscuous females in the size of the testicles of the male. Yeah. Which is why girls have little tiny dicks. Yeah. Cause they're just dominating. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:05:28       Well I, I wouldn't, I wouldn't try to do some other alpha bad idea. I mean crazy that something grew to be so strong, so powerful with giant fangs and it only eats like stalks of grass. And Broccoli and shit. Yeah. So there's, there's a lot of these little things in psychology, these little urban myths that get, you know, learn by professors and Grad school and never really tested and then passed on. And now that whole house of cards has been tumbling down the last couple of years where like almost everything that was taught in a social psychology course now turns out to be kind of bullshit and not like what other examples? Um, the idea that you can use a implicit association test or iat to sort of register how sexist or racist somebody is. Right. That was a big exciting thing that social psychologist thought that they'd discovered that you can give someone this kind of computer test that measures word associations and that kind of determine like how secretly sexist are you.

Speaker 2:          02:06:45       And that turned into a whole industry of giving these tests, everybody in corporations to sort of assess, you know, are you secretly sexist and it, and to sort of wag fingers at them and say, see, you scored positive on this test, that means you really are secretly sexist and therefore you need training. Mm. Um, and that's the industry and this is what happened with starbucks, right? A few months ago when they had that issue with the black guys and the starbucks and starbucks didn't handle that well, and then there is public blow back and starbucks went, okay, we're going to do implicit association training for all of our staff nationwide. And all of us in psychology. We're like, wait, but you, you guys know that was all debunked like a couple of years ago. It's all nonsense. No, they're just concerned about the optics in order to make their stock go up. Right? Oh yeah. Yeah. So it's, it's a pr move, but, but it's not science based. It's not science based on, and anybody who's a savvy consumer will be able to like Google this stuff and see, oh, it's, it's nonsense. But implicit bias training is still being used. Right. And so, and it's all horse shit. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:08:07       So what is the method like, say if you ran a corporation and, uh, like, uh, hey everybody, Jeffery's going to come in and teach us how not to be racist. You might be racist, not even know it. And Jeffrey's going to show you how,

Speaker 2:          02:08:21       I don't really know what they do in implicit bias training. I know that they typically will give everybody one of these implicit association tests that purports to show that you have issues and you do have hidden bias. Like what would be like a question on one of these tests? It's like associations. It's basically d are you faster to associate this stigmatized group with this negative word than you are to associate them with a positive word? And you can measure reaction time. Oh boy. So lever in your hand or by you're pushing, you're pushing, you're seeing words flash on screens and you're pushing buttons. And the, the subtle differences in reaction speed to like the good versus the bad associations are supposed to map like your attitude towards the group in question. And it's a, it's a reliable a fact. The problem is it doesn't actually predict real sexist behavior in real life or racist behavior.

Speaker 2:          02:09:27       So, so how did it get past the initial stages to the point what was implemented? Um, social psychology has just a very politically correct, virtually everybody in it is pretty far left. And if you're conservative or centrist, you pretty quickly get driven out of it. Really? Oh yeah. So Centra, Steven, um, well we have pretty good data now unlike like political affiliations of people in different fields and in psychology it's at least like 10 or 15 to one liberal to conservative. Why do you think that is? Is that more of the indoctrination of the walled garden of academia? I think it's partly that, but I think it's also like there is pretty overt hostility to, um, centrist conservatives, libertarians where you just kind of get these signals. Like if you start Grad school that, um, whatever you asked all others, other students, Hey, do you want to go to the shooting range or do you want to go hunting? Or let's talk about politics. And if you're on the wrong side of what's considered normal, then you're made to feel pretty uncomfortable. And you'll probably just, you know, leave Grad school and go, uh, the hell with that. I'm going to be a lawyer, entrepreneur. Um, whatever.

Speaker 4:          02:10:59       So just the hostility forces people out. It's as a tribal environment. Yeah. What was the source of that? I mean, it seems like if you're going to do real social experimental work, if you're really going to try to understand human behavior, it's really gotta be done objectively to really get the actual raw data to really be able to do scientific work where you're explaining things and trying to gauge cause and effect and origins of thought and behavior patterns. You'd have to do it really objectively the same way you would do mathematics. You'd have to really look at it cautiously and get your data points in order and, and, and if you're doing real good work, you would think that there would be more of an inclination to do good work, then it would be to a ps whatever tribe you belong to too.

Speaker 2:          02:11:58       He would hope so. But, um, take political psychology, for example, where the whole point is to understand how people think about politics and moral issues. There's a huge liberal bias and political psychology and you would think they would have corrected that and said, you know what, it's that maybe we're missing something by not like we have a conference of 500 people and there's not a single libertarian here or whatever. And they never self corrected like that. Um, they just assumed, well, we're all well intentioned and we're all smart so we're going to be able to, to check our own biases and they completely failed to do that. So you have all these measures of like political attitudes invented by leftists that kind of demonize conservatives or, or centrists as basically being mentally ill or, or stupid or, or whatever. Where do you fit on the political spectrum?

Speaker 2:          02:13:00       I'm kind of a centrist libertarian with like a complicated patchwork of views. Like I, I'd be considered extremely far left on certain things and pretty far right on, on other things like what far right and what? Um, I'm pro gun rights. I'm pretty cautious about immigration, um, on pro economic freedom. Um, I don't want a big, expensive state that has high tax burdens and, um, um, in, in complicated ways, kind of profoundly values and pro natalist and like, I think longterm relationships are good, not necessarily conventional ones, but I'm pretty concerned about society figuring out a way to make it possible for ordinary folks to have longterm relationships and raise families.

Speaker 4:          02:14:04       Isn't it fascinating that that's a right wing thing? Wouldn't you think that something that would encourage families like the universal, it wouldn't be tribal. I mean, you would think that something that would encourage longterm relationships and monogamous pair bonding and people getting together and working out long term solutions to keep a family together,

Speaker 2:          02:14:31       that'd be, uh, that'd be good for everybody you would think. I mean, that seems like a left wing thing too. So the left is very concerned about environmental sustainability. Right? Right. But they're not that concerned about kind of what you could call the civilizational sustainability or family sustainability. And I don't totally understand why, but you tend to get the right thinking, um, how's this going to affect my great grandkids or allow me to have any, and the left is more like how's this gonna Affect Harp seals and polar bail bears in a hundred days and one should sort of imply the other but

Speaker 6:          02:15:17       okay.

Speaker 4:          02:15:19       Hence being a centrist

Speaker 2:          02:15:21       [inaudible]. Yeah, that's being a centrist and like

Speaker 2:          02:15:27       it's a weird thing like when you try to reach a conclusion about a particular political issue based on what you think is think of the facts and the evidence in the good arguments and then you do that for each issue separately. Right. Rather than doing kind of tribal affiliation signaling, it's very, very confusing to people because they're like how can you be like pro cannabis legalization if you're also pro guns or how can you be like open to polyamory if you're also concerned about long term family stability or whatever. I was like, that's just cause of the issues I looked into. That's the end dies. I ended up supporting.

Speaker 4:          02:16:19       Does this go back to what we were talking about earlier, that most people really don't have the time to form these opinions or become informed on these opinions and instead they just sort of adopt a pattern of

Speaker 3:          02:16:29       behavior that seems to be the tribe that they most affiliate with. So this this way are, there's a conglomeration of opinions. I'm just going to accept these opinions. Yeah, absolutely. It's so strange that we have to very clear sides this left, right? I mean, we even have it represented by blue and red. I mean this goes back to, uh, the Korean version of the Yin Yang, you know, and um, the Korean flag, they have that Yin Yang, but it's instead of white and black, it's red and blue. I mean that, that is what it is. It's these, these opposites that work together in harmony. It's,

Speaker 10:         02:17:14       well,

Speaker 3:          02:17:15       our society, it's, well, I mean we, it seems to be some sort of a natural system that we gravitate towards.

Speaker 2:          02:17:21       Yeah. And people police it. It's not like everyone just sort of chooses one side or the other and then, and then they go, well I guess it makes sense that if you believe the laughed about issue a should also believe the left about issues b c through z. If you deviate, you got punished for it.

Speaker 3:          02:17:38       Well people use the term we to like we've got to win the house. I've heard that, you know, we've got to win the Senate. What, who's we? Yeah. Are we running bob? Like what are we doing? But people, it's, it's basically like the raiders. We got to get to the superbowl.

Speaker 2:          02:17:55       I mean it is very tribal but I mean it's weird because when, if you're in a literal tribe, you have your territory and your resources and your, your mates that you're defending and the other tribe on the other side of the hill has their territory resources, mates and kids and you actually, there is a little bit of a zero sum conflict. But if you're all in the same effing country together, yeah. And you're all paying taxes to the same authority and you're all partaking in the same economy and you're all wrestling in the same public sphere of, of the Netflix that you watch and the twitter we are engaged with. It's, it should be more positive sum than that.

Speaker 3:          02:18:43       Well, this is why I wanted to ask you this. As an evolutionary psychologist, does this, and you know, you're, you're obviously far more aware of this and the average person, does this just go back to the way the human brain developed when we were living in small tribes and that there's this inherent need for an us versus them mentality that keeps us moving?

Speaker 2:          02:19:03       Yeah, I think so. Um, you know, the people who have thought the most deeply about this, like I'm a big fan of Jonathan Heights' work and the righteous mind and the way he kind of analyzes this stuff. Um, I think it will be quite hard to escape the tribal thinking, but we have, we have escaped it with respect to a lot of issues, right? Where we really did, did reach a moral common ground. Like we all kind of Said, Oh shit, slavery was bad. Women should be able to vote.

Speaker 9:          02:19:42       MMM.

Speaker 2:          02:19:44       We should try to reduce the risk of nuclear war. Right. So on some really big issues, we have succeeded pretty well. And kind of setting aside the, the, the tribalism, I think the problem now is there's just so many issues that are coming at us so fast that we don't have time to reach that.

Speaker 9:          02:20:06       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:20:06       Social equilibrium on, on and off of them quickly enough.

Speaker 3:          02:20:10       Well, this is what fascinates me by augmented reality and things like neuro link, something that's going to accentuate the, the ability and the power of the human mind, where we're going to be able to take into consideration all of these things. Um, in a much like with Elan's term, we'll have more bandwidth to work on them. Yeah. It just, I think the more I think about it, I think that this just quagmire of civilization. There's so many different things that were conflicted about that really. A lot of it boils down to a lack of time, lack of time, and a lack of also training in how to think. One of the things that's most disturbing about education, particularly lower education, is that no one ever tells you how to think. They give you information, but they don't tell you. Now here's the tricks your brain is playing on you.

Speaker 3:          02:21:04       Like this is why you think certain ways. This is if you're lucky, if you're really lucky, someone teaches you about discipline, they teach you about resistance and about apathy in about about a procrastination and all these different games that your mind will play on you. And just that alone will give you the ability to work through things and get more stuff done. But very rarely does that even get discussed. So most of the time you're just getting boring information stuffed into your fucking face and you barely pay attention to it enough to pass the test. And as soon as the test is over, you forget everything you learned. I learned

Speaker 2:          02:21:41       because he really didn't learn it. You just memorize it. And I wouldn't take that long to learn sort of the top dozen rationality hawks that like the rationalist community or the effective altruism community are very, very good at using and teaching. Like just the idea of steel manning an argument where you develop the ability to state the strongest possible version of your opponent's argument in a way that they would go. You've said that even better than I could say. Awesome. That means you really understand me even if you disagree with it. That's a good term to steel man as opposed to a straw man. Yeah. And if we just taught, you know, kids in high school how to do that, um, I think that would go long way towards being able to have these, these tribal dialogues. Um, or just that being able to think quantitatively about political and policy issues. Like how many people are affected, how are they affected, how much would it cost to fix? How do we know what the best way to do it is? Um, rather than just diving straight for the emotional argument.

Speaker 2:          02:22:54       I think that would help a lot. But is it really in anyone's vested interest to teach that and do the current stock of members of the public school teachers unions really have the ability or interest to teach that. Right. It almost seems like something they're going to have to learn online and to augment their traditional education. Yeah. So ideally you'd have like a virtual reality system where a kid could go into it and argue about some issue like gun rights or abortion or immigration and some ai would sort of argue against them or picking out their arguments or go convince me of your position. Right. And somehow or another make it interesting. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Make it fun. Like they, whatever make it, uh, you know, make it, you're arguing with rick and Morty, right. That is a,

Speaker 4:          02:23:53       one of the big issues with learning things is making things fun, making things somehow or another, a enthralling and captivating something, something that you actually want to absorb. And it's one of the great arguments about video games. And um,

Speaker 4:          02:24:13       one of the more interesting things about the previous generations, sort of a dismissal of video games, is that the dismissal was at one point in time, oh, you're just wasting your time. And now that, that dismissal doesn't necessarily hold water, because just like professional golfers, professional video game players now make enormous sums of money. So it's gotten to this place where, oh no, this is a viable career and perhaps you should even be taking your kid to coaching and learning strategy and learning all these, you know, various applications that allow you to get better at these things that, cause there's a real career in this and mean. Try telling that to your GRANDPA, Hey, I'm going to play. Um, what's the, what's the game they played for the most money today? Fortnite. Fortnite right? Yes. The big one that you're going to wait, I want to be a professional fortnight player. They would say, get the fuck Outta here. But you know, I'm going to be a professional golfer. How good are you, Johnny? You know, I'm an underpart,

Speaker 2:          02:25:11       eh? Yeah, I want to be the next tiger woods. Well, in my cohort, a lot of other academics I've talked to like, Hey, did you play Sid Meier civilization a lot in Grad school or postdoc and yeah. And we all go,

Speaker 5:          02:25:28       yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:25:29       most of our understanding about the history of technology and like world affairs and economics comes from playing that game. Really? Yeah. I never played it. How does it work? Is it a one of those role playing games? He started out in like the dark ages and you progress through like Bronze Age, Iron Age, you invent railroads and then eventually you like colonize Alpha Centauri and you playing against the computer or it's the human's turn based strategy game against the computer. Um, but you kind of learn the whole technology tree and what everything's called and what followed what and God I Hope said Meyer got it right more or less, but it was a much more compelling way to learn all that than like taking whatever European history ap. Right. I would imagine that's incredibly immersive. Like how,

Speaker 8:          02:26:17       how could they do something like that? Oh, the new discovery mode turns on assassin's creed origins is doing interactive history lessons. It's like ancient Egypt I believe is what they do here. And it's like deep detail, really creation of it. You go through it and they take for this mode, they kind of take all the the shoot and that's shooting but stabbing and killing the people and just walk you through ancient and Egypt. Cairo you get to see people die. Not In this mode. Maybe they did. They might show some stuff of what not, but so that you can either have it graphic or non graphic cause that's the idea. Yeah. Then they can show you through the map, take you to play a video of this. Can I watch this? I think so. I need to see this. I'll look it up like okay. Yeah. I mean that would be the best way to teach people. Things do make some sort of interactive environment, especially virtual where you could go there and experience it. And, and I mean, I don't know if you've messed around with any of the htc vive things. Oh is this year? So yeah, it's just like a tour of the full screen with this.

Speaker 8:          02:27:19       Hello Mrs. This is part of the game but this is not the actual game. This is like a mode they did to teach kids cause they had all of this technology available. So they said, you know what, just get a narrator, add some audio clips, making a mode. Wow world. And they even have it the way it was originally built. The Great Pyramid with the limestone still attached for the most part. This is a 20 minute videos. This is like, this is real deep detailed man. He's like the best Graham Hancock, you know, explanation you could get, but you're the guy there and you're in a third person position. You probably could go first person too, I'm sure. Wow. This is just this particular part. They're going to keep doing this as well. This assassin's creed has gone through all sorts of different modes of history through the renaissance, Rome, Spain, all sorts of different areas. And now that they sort of turn this on, it's gonna ramp up probably. Well that to me like a really

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       good idea in terms of getting kids excited about learning things, having some sort of an interactive game. Yeah. Just game a game of every topic. Yeah. Everything up really high quality way. Yeah. And I think the tricky thing with um, you know, education is the kind of tech that we use is several steps behind the state of the art in Hollywood. Special effects or documentaries or this, this kind of game. So the students are kind of disappointed when they come to class. Right? Right. And it's like college is really expensive and it's really retro grade in terms of the tech quality. So why, why are we here? Um, we should be on the forefront, right. It should be possible to go to your State University and see awesome gamified interactive stuff that you don't have access to at home. But everything is changing so fast. And in order for the curriculum to keep up with modern technology, it would have to revamp every year. Well, I mean, a lot of the content we teach is pretty old actually. Like the key ideas and evolutionary biology. Many of them go back 50 or a hundred years. Um, key ideas in animal behavior or paleontology or, um, anthropology. It's not like those get updated that fast. It's just the way you can present them. Technically

Speaker 2:          02:29:58       we're, we're not competitive.

Speaker 9:          02:30:01       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:30:01       And that's embarrassing. Is there a way to change that or is that, that seems almost insurmountable without a complete overhaul. The system, I think you need a totally different kind of university and credential that's backed by a significant amount of capital and that's technology, technological, innovative, and it's very on pc in terms of what it teaches and how it teaches. Do you think that's possible that would come along and compete with the standard? Yes. Yeah. I think it's inevitable that that will happen and then that's probably going to be what bankrupts and I think it's going to eat our lunch.

Speaker 2:          02:30:42       Yeah. What do you, how do you feel about that though? As a person who makes their living? Do, I mean, I'll see you write books and I'd be happy to jump ship and go do that. What did you oh yeah. Good for you. If I could like teach hundreds of thousands or millions of people rather than write 200 at a time. Well that's essentially what Jordan Peterson is doing. Yeah, exactly. But he's not doing it through a virtual thing. He's doing it through video lectures and then physical lectures. It's really fascinating to see the reaction to him. And now to Sam Harris is doing this as well, but not the videos, but he's definitely doing the uh, the live sort of performances. And

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       No, who would've ever thought there would be a place where public intellectuals would go and 5,000 people would sell out like that and go to see them? Like they would go to see fucking Kevin Hart or something. It's crazy. Yeah. Well, you know, when

Speaker 2:          02:31:35       Kenzie first started doing a sec surveys and he would go around the country giving lectures, like he filled up a 4,000 person stadium and in UC Berkeley, just presenting the first real data on human sexuality back in late forties, I think. Wow. And so there was why, because there's a real hunger for that because it was something the students couldn't get anywhere else. And the same was true back in the 18 hundreds when you had famous authors touring America, like Mark Twain or um, many people think is the founder of standup comedy. Yeah, yeah. Right. And they would use humor like Jordan Peterson, Sam Harris, you, um, and they would speak in the register of the people, not pretentious academic jargon.

Speaker 3:          02:32:27       Sam is surprisingly funny. I told that we had dinner recently and we were talking and I said, dude, you're really funny. Like those, those little side notes and asides you throw out little funny quips like this is like standup comedy type stuff. When someone will say something like, like even with you though, you guys were talking about polyamory and there was he through some sort of a joke? Like how's that working out? Yeah, no, it's a very dry humor, which I love. Yeah. Um, so funny guy, but that makes it more palatable. Spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. You know, this fascinating technology in terms of video games is going to help you absorb information about ancient Egypt. And humor is going to help just make the time go by better and make the whole experience less flat.

Speaker 2:          02:33:17       Yeah. So I think, I think that's a future and I think within 10 years, um, a lot of young people are just going to realize if I can actually learn more from some alternative system, some franchise of really good gamified instruction plus great presenters who have a sense of humor and are smart and, and kind of like Hetero docs and, and edgy, they're going to flock to that. The main thing is that business, that franchise would have to provide a credential that actually separates them from people who don't have it and that predicts performance in companies or in the future. Right. Cause that's the main function of the university right now is it? It's this credential signaling system. And if somebody figures out a way to make it so that like if you've got a degree from this,

Speaker 5:          02:34:23       okay,

Speaker 2:          02:34:24       whatever Sam Harris University, that that is really a better predictor of doing well in a job or a marriage. Right. Then a Yale degree, then suddenly the whole business model changes for universities.

Speaker 3:          02:34:39       Well, what's really fascinating when you think about the history of education is that our ideas about these gigantic institutions, whether it's Yale or Harvard, is that they've been long established and long proven and bolt. No, I mean a few hundred years in terms of people being alive. That ain't shit. You know, you go back before that you're, this is really, you only have a certain amount of years where these things were even a real thing.

Speaker 2:          02:35:06       Yeah. And I mean the idea that you have a teaching institution that's also a major research institution really only goes back to post World War II. Like before World War II, Harvard was basically an elite finishing school. It wasn't a research power. So that whole system that we think of as being ancient as actually just less than a hundred several decades. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker 5:          02:35:32       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:35:32       Yeah. Um, I think you're probably right. I think the new things can eat the lunch. Yeah. Well that's, it's almost like they're setting themselves up. I mean with some of the more ridiculous and preposterous protests that go on where there they are just trying to silence discussion. And even with people like Christina Hoff summers who's very reasonable and calls herself a factual feminist and they want to call her a Nazi, it's like there's no, there's no wiggle room. You are a one or a zero, you are black or white, you are evil or good. And that's it. And this inclination towards Silencing People d platforming, screaming them down, halting them and getting them out and who decides who decides who's correct and rock? Well, the only way for people to get an accurate assessment of who's giving the right information is to have a debate, but to have a real debate, like a real debate where people are allowed to express themselves without people in the audience shaking jars of coins and bull horns and all the nonsense and setting off fire alarms and all these things that these children, and I call them children because they're behaving like children are celebrating.

Speaker 3:          02:36:43       You know, I'm sure you're aware of what happened at Evergreen and now evergreens, uh, Evergreen State University where Bret Weinstein had, you know, his horrible experience with, if you don't know the story, I'll give you the brief synopsis. The, they had a day of absence where it used to be that people of color would stay home so that you would miss them. And then he decided to turn around and make white people stay home, make them, force them. If you didn't do it, you're a racist. He said, that's crazy. Like you guys are being racist. And they shouted him down and they shut the school down and he won a half a million dollars in a lawsuit. Uh, and thou, the schools, most recent enrollment from the freshman class was only 300 people, which is crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:37:26       Yeah. I'm noticing the parents noticed, the students notice and universities are so complacent. They think, oh, we can, we can do any amount of this. Yeah. And the customers will still come and they're, they're wrong. As soon as there's a viable alternative where somebody can get a credential that means something and it's cheaper and better and they learn more and it's more engaging that hole it universities acting stupid about that and, and you know, denying free speech and denying real debate. That's the existential threat to them. That's what's going to blindside them. That's what's going to kill their tuition. It's stunning how little resistance there is to it. Yeah. That you,

Speaker 3:          02:38:12       the everyone knows that the only way to find out whose ideas are more, more well thought out, more valid, more factual. The only way to find that out is to have people discuss things together. Yeah. And T for you to be able to make an assessment based on the facts, do it in real time and based on who was who farms a more compelling argument, who's more reasonable, who's, who's taught, who's addressing all the flaws and the problems with both sides of this and coming up with a reasonable conclusion. The only way to do that as discourse. We all know that and we've known that forever, but, but somehow or another in higher universities in higher education centers, this is where they're shutting this stuff down and they want to, you know, whatever, whether it's Ben Shapiro is speaking or whoever it is, it's speaking, they want to scream at them, they want to yell, they want to break windows, they want to co you know, column racists or whatever they want to call them. Stunning.

Speaker 2:          02:39:16       I mean, the way I think of it is like standup comedy. I love and, and you know, you do and the stuff you can say when you're on stage doing standup comedy university should be at least that open. Like I should be able to lecture in a way that goes even a little bit edgier than most standup comedy could go politically, intellectually, ideologically challenged the thoughts, challenged their thoughts. So universities should be like the inner sanctum of intellectual freedom compared to which everything else is more restrained. And we're kind of the opposite. Like, I know a few academics who go, who actually are like amateur standup comedians and it's so liberating to them to be able to get up on a stage and say what they really think. Dev Use fake names.

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       Um,

Speaker 2:          02:40:18       no, but they're kind of protected by like the social norms of comedy, right? Like, you know, you're not supposed to really take it very seriously. Um, but we're, we're so far from that and you know, in physics it doesn't matter that much because it's not like there's any aspects of quantum mechanics that are that intellectually edgy, but man and psychology and the social sciences and behavioral sciences and in political science it's really important to be able to be provocative and authentic and, and we can't in America at the moment,

Speaker 3:          02:41:06       well, which is really what's going to set up whatever's coming next. It's going to offer some sort of a new new pathway, new avenue that's not restricted. Yeah. Much like what you're seeing with a podcasts and blogs and all in, in comparison to, or youtube videos in comparison to what you're getting on regular network television mean it was network television. And then cable was the more edgy alternative, and then there was pay cable like Hbo, like, Oh my God, I saw breasts and then that got nuttier and nuttier and, but then it became Netflix, which is a total nother level, and then the internet is the wild west and they want you to go back to NBC in the 1970s and you're like, ah, no, I'm not going to do it. No, not going to pretend, but university seemed to be stuck.

Speaker 2:          02:41:56       Yeah. I think universities are like NBC Circa 1975 right, where they're like, oh, this cable stuff that's not really gonna matter, and then, oh, this internet and that, but the Netflix of education is coming and it's, it's going to be incredibly disruptive and I hope that the academic friends and colleagues I have who are good and an open minded art ready to jump ship

Speaker 3:          02:42:26       because ultimately they're educators, whatever form it is that what their career is. Is there an educator, just like Kyle Dunnigan is a comedian, he takes on a new form with this new technology and he becomes a comedian using face swapping technology that these educators are going to recognize that the, the landscape has changed and there's gotta be some sort of a new way of distributing information.

Speaker 2:          02:42:51       Yeah, I could have good academics or like just ordinary humans with their curiosity turned up to 11 and who have a passion for discovering new ideas and then sharing them with people. And we don't really care how we do that. We will do it through lectures or writing books or writing articles or podcasts, whatever works the best. Have you thought about starting a podcast? Well, you know, I did a podcast with Tucker Max a couple of years ago, the maiden grounds where it was sort of related to our mate book that was dating advice for young single guys. Um, but it wasn't realized. It wasn't really, well, it was figure out what women authentically actually one and then try to transform yourself in that direction. So you're a better boyfriend. What do they want? A women want guys who are uh, well informed and know about the world and ambitious and capable capability is the main thing, like competency just in as many domains as possible. Um, they want guys who were in like reasonably good physical shape and good mental health and um, who can strike the right balance between being kind of Nice and agreeable and kind, but also being dominant and assertive and um, kind of high status.

Speaker 4:          02:44:14       And if that's too much to ask, you become a male feminist, just grovel, just bend of the knee, bend the knee. So

Speaker 2:          02:44:26       yeah. And you know, when I teach human sexuality, I kind of emphasize this to students that there's a lot you can do to make yourself more attractive to whoever you want to attract it. You don't, it's not all limited by what traits you're born with.

Speaker 4:          02:44:41       Well, it's fascinating is the difference in what a man is attracted to versus what's a woman's attracted to. And this is something that we just don't like to admit. Yeah. There's a great deal of difference when it comes to heterosexuals at least.

Speaker 2:          02:44:55       Yeah. I mean there's a lot of difference when it comes to short term mating, like what men want if it's a one night stand versus what women want. And if you look at long term mating, like who people choose for marriage, there's actually quite a bit of convergence there. Like everybody wants someone who's mentally healthy and reliable and smart and kind and would make like would pick the kids up on time from school. Yes,

Speaker 4:          02:45:22       et cetera. And funny, funny is really important. Bret Weinstein, um, talked about the difference between a woman who is beautiful versus a woman who's hot. And what hot does is it gives you the opportunity to spread your genes with very little responsibility. So a one night stand for, I'm a girl who's hot. You don't have to mate. You don't have to like court her, get her to love you, show your virtue, earn her respect. Now he just bang her in the park like that. That's hot versus someone who's beautiful, who you really go out of your way to maybe even be a better person so that you could attract that person.

Speaker 2:          02:46:06       Yeah. Yeah. If you fall in love with someone, you want to be a better person for them.

Speaker 4:          02:46:11       But it's fascinating that there are these two choices. And I never really thought about it until he brought it up. But, but they're essentially ways to distribute your DNA. There's pathways. One of them is through longterm bonding and you want a stable, reliable woman who has a lot of self respect, who chooses you. It makes you feel good, she choose you and the other one's a freak.

Speaker 2:          02:46:34       Yeah. But the fact that all different kinds of people exist with all different mating strategies shows put each of those strategies historically and evolutionarily has worked like it's been a valid strategy. Yeah. Cause there wouldn't be like promiscuous men or women if that hadn't been something that worked. Sure. Right. There also wouldn't be longterm pair bonded, you know, family people if that hadn't worked. So I think it's silly when people are sort of dissing each other's mating strategies as if, well there's one proper way. And then all the other ways it sort of degenerate or reactionary or

Speaker 4:          02:47:18       whatever. Well the other mating strategies produced fucked up kids. I mean, you know the, the hot one when you're not going to see the kid, you can develop a mess of a child. And those are the ones they used to sell cars,

Speaker 2:          02:47:30       right? I mean, but each fucked up by what standards. So,

Speaker 4:          02:47:36       well there's dots, the question father around, you know, you have daddy issues.

Speaker 2:          02:47:42       I think a lot of that is just a way of kind of shaming these, these other mating strategies. Cause you mean, well of course you get a little bit of circular logic. For example, where you say this mating strategy, for example, let's say a high degree of promiscuity, you say that's bad. Why? Because it leads to offspring who in turn act promiscuous and then you call it the cycle of abuse or daddy issues or whatever.

Speaker 4:          02:48:13       But it's not a promiscuous thing. Or is it just a longing for both a father and a mother and a loneliness and a vulnerability that seems to come with being a, the offspring of a single mother. Most people agree that that's not the ideal situation, but it does produce unique people, which is really interesting. Like all, most, all of my really cool friends came from a fucked up, broken childhood, which I don't know what to think about that because I want my children to be comforted and healthy and never worried about the future, but all my friends that grew up in chaotic environments where everyone was poor and fucked up and there's crime and violence and nonsense and chaos. Those are the interesting ones. Their parents are drug addicts. Those are the cool ones too. It's, it's such a, as a parent,

Speaker 2:          02:49:10       yeah. I mean, so like as a scientist, you've got to look at the whole spectrum of mating and parenting behavior and go, particularly as an evolutionary psychologist, you can say, I might have a moralistic reaction to that. I might go, that's bad, but you know what? If it actually, if what we consider bad is actually the way most of the other 4,000 species of mammals do it, then who, who were really the weird families anyway, right? Most mammo families, the dads aren't involved. It's single moms raising offspring by themselves under harsh conditions and they, they're not doing pair bonds. Right? Hardly any mammals do pair bonds apart from like gibbons and few prosimians, like really small primates.

Speaker 6:          02:50:04       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:50:05       I, I'm just very hesitant to kind of moralize it and, but it isn't really fair or even accurate to compare ourselves to things that only lived to be like 10 I mean we're, we're talking about enormously complicated emotions, far more so because of communication and societal norms and eh, you know, the comparison. Yeah. There's so much more involved being a person.

Speaker 6:          02:50:31       Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:50:32       It's just like, if you look back historically right there, premarital sex is to be demonized. Right? And folks used to say, well, oh my God, you had, you had one or two lovers before you settled on with your husband, that's terrible. And you could produce statistical correlations to say, oh look, premarital sex is correlated with being lower class or criminal or drug use or whatever. I'm like, that's all true. But then society moved in a direction that said premarital sex is okay.

Speaker 4:          02:51:03       But wasn't that really because of birth control? Because a woman's once, once a woman had an ability to control her reproductive system and say, you know, I can hit, just have sex for pleasure and enjoyment. Yeah. Because before it was the consequences are so grave. Especially in poverty. Yeah. Like now there's another mouth to feed and now I can't work because I have to take care of the babies. Oh, right. Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:51:26       Yeah. So the technology of contraception made a big difference. Um, it used to be thought, okay, if you're, if you're gay or lesbian, that is morally degenerate and terrible and invalid and you can't possibly have a longterm relationship or a family or whatever. And then we kind of changed that pretty dramatically in the last 20, 30 years. So I just, you know, as a sex researcher, I want people to

Speaker 2:          02:51:57       be quite cautious about saying that lifestyle is wrong and degenerate and unhealthy and this other lifestyle is better because in the era of sex bots, right. In virtual reality, deep fakes and whatever, who knows what's going to happen. Well, if you read sex at dawn, yeah. Did you like it? I had very mixed feelings about it. What was the negative? Um, I don't think it's an accurate description of pre history, prehistoric meeting. Um, I think pair bonds, Ron, really deep and human evolution, but I think as a sort of ethical ideal, um, polyamory is, is okay and it works for some people some of the time. And this is something that you've discussed a lot. Polyamory. Um, I really only kind of came out publicly as being interested in it on the Sam Harris' show a few months ago, but I'm, I'm thinking about writing a book on it next and um, it's a very popular thing.

Speaker 2:          02:53:05       I mean the number of people who are in open relationships or poly relationships is larger than the number of people who are gay or lesbian. Certain really? Oh, for sure. Yeah. What's the number of people in gay or lesbian relationships? Number of people who are gay or lesbian at the population level is like two to 5% depending on the surveys in polyamorous relationships. Um, probably five to 15% at the moment. And it's even higher among people under 35 or so. So this is a new thing. It's relatively new. And is this just an acceptance of the instincts that people have to be nonmonogamous the acceptance of the, that, that, that jealousy is holding people back from experiencing different things? Like, yeah, I think it's only in the 90s that you, you got a coherent subculture that said if you're not going to be monogamous, here's the honest, ethical, open way to do it.

Speaker 2:          02:54:05       And it kind of developed a bunch of social norms about how you manage these relationships in a way that's different from cheating or different from swingers or different from prostitute, hippie love communes or, or prostitutes. And I mean this is a longer discussion than we have time for probably today. But, um, as a researcher it's a fascinating culture because it's people who are trying to find ways to kind of hack their jealousy and manage it better. Yeah. Um, and it's also a new method of social networking, right? Where you're not drawing a sharp line between who you are sexually connected to and who you're socially connected to. Um, so people who were in depaul a tend to have sort of sexual friendship, professional networks that are much broader than done. A lot of people tend to have. And I, I think that's actually a little bit more similar to what Christopher Ryan was talking about with sex at dawn [inaudible]. Like I think in most prehistoric tribes, anybody who wasn't a close relative who was sort of mating age, you probably would have had sex with like sooner or later at least once, even if you both had a sort of stable, um, paramont

Speaker 3:          02:55:30       and this is probably an incredibly controversial subject at the academic level.

Speaker 2:          02:55:39       Well, when I taught my course on polyamory and open sexuality last year, it got a little bit of controversy. You say that with smile in the department. Um, well there was concern about what happens if, you know, you get complaints from

Speaker 3:          02:56:00       legislators. Ah, there it goes again. Funding, yeah, money. But yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:56:08       Um, there's a lot of cool research on it. There was a lot of interesting psychological issues. Plus if your students, probably a good way to find the freaks. It was, they were wonderful, wonderful freaks. I mean those wrong, great in a freak, great students and open minded and you know, we talked about the pros and the cons. It's like this stuff is really hard to do for this and this and this reason and people really only succeed at it if they have certain kinds of traits and abilities and communication skills. And if they don't, they crash and burn and doesn't work. So it wasn't just an advocacy class, it was also like here's the pros and cons, but also as a social trend, this is a big deal. And if you're going into one of the caring professions like medicine, nursing, social work, clinical psych, you damn well better know about this because a lot of people do it. And if you're giving advice to a couple and they're in an open relationship and you don't even understand what that means or how it works, you're going to give bad advice. And that's to me kind of professional malpractice.

Speaker 3:          02:57:25       Hmm. It's also sort of in some ways, an ongoing experiment in terms of how, you know, how people bond with each other, how people form communities. Yeah. And this is in particular with in today's climate, in today's society with the, you know, the ability to distribute this information and discuss these things in groups and yeah, it's a different world in terms of just collecting data and it and comparing experiences.

Speaker 2:          02:57:59       Yeah. It's a work in progress. I mean, I think nobody who is polyamorous or in an open relationship can pretend that, yeah, we really know how to make this work very well and here's the best practices and here's the, all the, the hacks and, and anybody can do it. No, we're absolutely not. At that point. It's also brave to talk about because it immediately puts you into this potential pervert place. Yeah. Like, you know, you talk about sex with more than like more than one person. Well, wait, what are you doing? What are you doing, Jeffrey? Yeah. What are you doing? I know you're wrecking your reputation. What are you doing? You have to having sex. I know it's super stigmatized. Yeah. But like compared to what? Compared to be an evolutionary psychologist in the first place, who does intelligence research or compared to teaching human sexuality or compared to doing just as a human and civilization doing a book with Tucker Max. I mean, that's tricky, right? Um, but I think we, we have a professional responsibility, you know, if you're a behavioral scientist to understand what are people doing out there, um, what is working and what isn't and how do you make it work better.

Speaker 2:          02:59:16       And the people who ignore it, I think it's kind of like if you were like a psychologist in the early seventies, right? When the gay and lesbian rights movement of starting, if you'd sort of said, Oh God, I hope that'll blow over like that. That doesn't deserve research. We, we, uh, we should keep it as a mental disorder. And you know, the, the Dsm, right, I feel like is sort of at the same place where, um, yeah, there are reactionaries who go that that's just gross and disgusting. Just like people in the early seventies would have said, homosexuality is gross and disgusting.

Speaker 2:          02:59:56       Well, it's still, it's, it's brave to discuss right now. I mean, it may very well be like, you know, when you're talking about the gay and lesbian rights revolution of the 1970s, it may be 40 years from now, it's just like that. Like, oh, they're this and this. Is that normal? No, who cares? But in today's Day and age, it's a tread carefully. Right? Well, somebody's got to research it and talk about it. Yeah. And um, I think like people should read sex at dawn Bicros, Christopher Orion. But that shouldn't be the final word about human evolution and polyamory. What's another good book on it? I mean, the ethical slut is a good kind of, that sounds like a restaurant. I mean, it's kind of the Poly Bible. Is it really the ethical slut? I love it. It's a, it's a, that um, dossie eat, uh, what's her name? Eaten, I think, I

Speaker 1:          03:00:59       can't remember. She's got a coauthor. It's slot. It's been right now I know it was a poly Bible for 20. Everybody buys that book just, just to have it on your shelf. I have, that book sells a billion copies. It's done pretty well at there. It is. The ethical slut. Yeah. Dossie Easton and Janet Hardy. What a great name for a book. I'm sad that I never came up with that. It's a good title, but I don't think there's a good book. Yeah. That's actually savvy about evolutionary psychology and human sexuality and polyamory and how it's all going to play out in the next 10 years or so. And this is why you were kind of planning, writing it yourself. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I hope you do, man. Thanks. And thanks for coming here. It's a lot of fun. It's been a pleasure. We had, we talked for three hours. Can you believe that? Oh my God. Yeah. We did time warp in this room. Time flew. Thank you Jeffrey. Really appreciate it. Welcome. Uh, tell people how to find you on twitter. I'm primal. Poly, P R, I m a L P O, l y. And I'm sorry, Jeffrey Miller and primal poly.com. Okay. Thank you, sir.
