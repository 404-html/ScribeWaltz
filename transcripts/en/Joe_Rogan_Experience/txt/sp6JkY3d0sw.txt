Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Oh Shit, I should've tweeted this. Well you know what folks, this is going to come out while I'm tweeting, tweeting at the same time as the Joe Rogan experience podcast brought to you by the fleshlight. If you go to Joe Rogan.net and click on the link for the fleshlight Shit, I can't do this. I can't type one thing and think, well I can't type, so flashlight. Is this thing you fuck? It's a big rubber, a sex toy for guys and there's a whole bunch of different kinds. They have different insights that feel different compared to the girls like Jenny Hayes feels a d really believe Isiah Kira. Do you really believe that 100 percent because there's other kind of sewers out there like wine guys who have like a really a good palette, like a little, a good d, good Dick Palette. Like guys, you can tell the perfect textures, the way a guy can tell what the textures are.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       Completely different. A good. If you got a flashlight.com, you can actually see what the inside of each girl looks like. So like there's different groups. There's different things in different girls like you know, some girls look like they have huge fucking cysts in their policies, but it might feel good against your Dick. You don't know. So about. Yeah, if you go there, there's one goes, I have like crazy bumps and like bubbles and waves and jagged good things. So they, they've, they create a bunch of different vagina environments. Different. It's like, yeah, exactly. And you get a discount if you go to Joe Rogan's website, uh, it's a Rogan and you get 15 percent off the number one sex toys for men. The fleshlight dude, you're an awesome commercial guy. You shouldn't do commercials like permanently. That's all you should do all day long because just do commercials.

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       So it ain't to segway. Artists were also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com. It's o, n n I t, makers of Alpha brain, the cognitive enhancing supplement that I enjoy. Uh, and uh, we also make shroom tech sport, which is the quarter sepsis mushroom supplement for endurance training. If you're like really into, if you do something really hard like a crossfit class or Jujitsu or something like that, that's for you. If you're, if you're not into that kind of working out, you're probably not going to notice a difference. Brian has no use for this stuff and not use this product, but I'm sure it's great. Do you do use the shroom tech immune though? Uh, I use the more, the new mood. That's what I've been grooving on is the new moon. I didn't mean when I feel sick and right now I don't feel sick. I just feel like I need to chill out and that's why I need the new mood because that's more of like a, you know, like calm, you down, had some trip to me, you know, you like Turkey dinner and now make that, that makes you tired when you're, you're done eating it well.

Speaker 1:          00:02:39       That kind of get, that has tryptophan in it and it makes you feel relaxed and it also makes you a little bit happier every day. I think if you take take it every day, I don't really take it. I take Alpha brain, I don't take the other ones. I changed my workout and the take Alpha brand and I take the immune shit. Anyway. What all this stuff is there. Nootropics, and this

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       is my advice to you if you don't know what we're talking about, don't buy anything please. Just Google nootropics. There is a lot of really interesting articles about the subject and it's controversial, but I've been, I've been experimenting with them for years and I enjoy them and not just the ones that we sell have used. Um, there was a football player, I think his name is Roman, asking pretty sure he has a company called neuro one and apparently he had dealt with some concussions and stuff so he created his own formula, like a neutral but formula to enhance the way his mind worked and it was really interesting and I enjoy that stuff. I have no vested interest in whether you buy it or don't buy it. I if you feel like you don't want to buy it or you feel like it's too expensive, I encourage people to steal the ingredients, copy it, and make your own like by, by the stuff in bulk and make your own.

Speaker 2:          00:03:55       Yeah. And I, you know, and the other thing is if you try and you don't like it, it's you get 100 percent money back. So we can't make it any easier. We can't make it any nicer. And what's most important to me is that nobody feels ripped off, that nobody wants to fucking blindly buy. Do you? Don't go to wikipedia. It's blacked out, but fucking go to yahoo or bing got in the other search engines that are not supporting the soap are against the Sopa movement. Soap movement. Scary as fuck, right? Yeah. Let's talk about that. Hamilton Morris is here listening. Go to [inaudible] dot com. Oh, N nit enter in the code named Rogan. Get 10 percent off. That's a bitches. All right, here we go. Amanda's here. The other one I talked to for a long time exploring them.

Speaker 3:          00:04:39       Joe Rogan podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:04:49       Hamilton Morris comes here with a video camera when the podcast in its most cluttered state possible. This room is a wreck. I looked like I should be on hoarders in this fucking room. Clean this bitch out is ridiculous. Too much traveling, man. Too much traveling. You know it is Hamilton Morris. Hello. What's up buddy? Thanks for. Thanks for coming on. Thanks for having me. I enjoyed a lot of your stuff that I saw online, man. Especially for those who don't know. You write for a. for Vice, right? For Vice Dot com. That's right. Vice magazine for Vice magazine. I think the first thing I ever saw you do. You were tripping somewhere in the jungle. I don't really remember what it was, but you, uh, you had taken some trip to hang out with some indigenous people. What did they give you? It was the Mirena Indians and they gave me a. well, they actually didn't give it to me. It was sort of a complicated trip to find them, but they traditionally use the venom of this frog cold fuel, limited use of by color that produces a denim that's written all of these different psychoactive peptides and specifically contains this

Speaker 4:          00:05:57       substance called der Morphin. That's a super potent opioid, but they kind of, yeah, but it doesn't have any sort of like a classical opioid effect, like it's not really a sedative and people claim that it gives them everlasting energy. They're able to hunt for days without sleep and to go days without eating and all sorts of supernatural feats. You have a great voice. By the way. Can we just say that you're very mysterious voice and it's very interesting. You should do cool shit if you know. Cool Shit. And you have a voice like that dude. Amazing plays. Sorry. So what is the effect this, this, this? Well, that's what I had been told that they would go days without requiring sleep and I'd be able to hunt all night for animals in the jungle with these Indians, Jesus. And uh, so I was expecting more of a stimulant type effect.

Speaker 4:          00:06:56       But then there's chemical warfare, morphine, there's no real reason you should expect it to be a stimulant. It's an opioid. There used to be a theory of autism that was based on them detecting derm orphan in the urine of autistic children. So they thought that there was some kind of bacterial organism in the intestine of these children that was naturally producing the Dir morphin. And so they thought autism with this kind of opioid mediated pathology, like, yeah. In the same way that you're talking about endogenous dmt and how that can cause a psychedelic experience without ingesting a drug. This was the idea is that there's an endogenous intestinal opioid bacteria that produces derma orphan, but it's ever been demonstrated anyway. So I it, it's never been demonstrated. So had they come to this conclusion as, that sounds so fascinating. It's amazing. Yeah. I never heard that theory before.

Speaker 4:          00:07:50       There's all kinds of psychoactive substances that have been detected in the urine of people with different sorts of mental illnesses. You know, there's five mod dmt detected in the urine of schizophrenia and Whoa. Totally makes sense. Yeah, totally makes sense. If you think about it, because we all have bodies, like people's bodies go haywire, you know, things, things go running. I have egos, I have spots on my hand where my pigment doesn't grow anymore, so it's like weird shit happens to bodies. We easily could happen to your bodies, your brain's ability to produce psychedelic chemicals. Could you imagine if every day was just tripping all day long? Like you couldn't get out of tripping Steph, licking frogs. You're licking this guy and paying him $20 just to get off. I don't know what you're doing with your body was producing a drug like a frog. Oh, and the that way. You know, I don't think it's that way. Brian. His body's now

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       producing a drug. He's ingesting his body's producing a drug internally. You silly boy, I, but what if they secreted it? Who the fuck you're secreting the guy? No, no. If you were producing the drug inside your body, if you're urinating secretion frog, how do they get it from? They do they actually get five Mao from frogs? Can they do that? Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, right. That's really some toads. Right, and how do you do that? Um, there's different techniques for doing a nice to know a guy that raised goofball various and she lives in Boston and his glands that I just squirted out pretty much collected at least for two on the neck and on the legs and he would grab it by the scruff of its neck and then take a cat and show it. The cat is terrified of cats and then that causes it to secrete the venom. And then he would pinch all of the glands onto a glass sheet and dry it. That's fucking. Tell you the secrets. Cat Joe in life, everything seems cat. We've been talking about feral cats. These cats making drugs. Yeah. That's incredible. Yeah. So you just scrape it up and smoke it? Yeah, but it's not just buy them Yo dmt. There's also apparently some quantity of Bufo Tinian and also a bunch of other things. That's why it's not really safe to eat it.

Speaker 2:          00:10:21       The things people were risked to get high. No, it's actually worth checking out. Really actually used to shop where I, I'd heard that before in the podcast. I was doing a lot of research and buying them in mass quantities when I lived in Ohio I think. Yeah, yeah. I mean maybe invest in a few frogs and cultivate a relationship with them. I mean, is it illegal? It may be illegal. Five immuno DMT was recently scheduled. So yeah, it uh, it used to be you could get in five mel dmt like on the Internet, right? Absolutely. Yeah. That's incredible. They just didn't know. Um, I don't think it really poses that much of a risk in terms of a doubt. There's very many dmt hospitalizations compared to even things like lsd. It's just such a rare thing and it lasts for such a short period of time.

Speaker 2:          00:11:12       You can just make it like a frog kissing booth to get around the law, you know, just say like, don't say like this is to lick and error to get the drug off of weight. You know, if you want this drug and you encase it, bring you to a doctor, I'm going to bring it to. You're going to bring you to a doctor and he's gonna. He's gonna. Find out what the fuck is wrong with you. You went too deep in the rabbit hole. You know what? When a guest like Hamilton Morris is here, I could see where you, uh, you get a little carried away. He just wanted to. You wanted to, you wanted to perform on his level, right? No, I, I just want to go where he is. Stoner is playing around too much. You already, you're not even a professional stoner. You're like a professional,

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       a psychoactive expert. You're like one of those dudes. So you can say, hey man, what is it about that lotus flower? And you can go, oh, well the ludas flower and you'll explain it perfectly. How do you know so much about all this stuff?

Speaker 4:          00:12:08       Well, I've studied it in school for years. I started out studying neuroscience and a.

Speaker 5:          00:12:13       where'd you go to school at the University of Chicago. So this was something that was just always pulling at you, like how the mind works and various chemicals. Um, yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:12:23       yeah. Not necessarily with the drug connection, but I was always interested in science and neuroscience and then once you understand that area, then it becomes even more interesting. And then also medicinal chemistry, pharmacology. It's all interrelated.

Speaker 5:          00:12:40       And now how did you start putting together these videos online?

Speaker 4:          00:12:44       Um, well I left Chicago and moved to New York and a friend of a friend worked at vice magazine and told the editor that I had been. I was interested both academically and in terms of writing about all of these psychedelic drugs and they want us to do more informed drug related content for the magazine. So I'm. So they asked me to start writing a monthly column, but vice used to have a totally different attitude towards drugs in terms of uh, you know, they'd give someone like an ounce of mushrooms and put them in a hotel room and just record everything. They did what was happening. They weren't really interested in the science of it, not that that's a bad thing.

Speaker 5:          00:13:26       So they used to have that attitude,

Speaker 4:          00:13:28       used to have that attitude and now they're more open minded to discussing the scientific aspects.

Speaker 5:          00:13:34       So do you think the scientific aspects for the longest time where it was it like, I think it was like maybe a hunter s Thompson that maybe fucked a lot of people up because his thing was just sort of tag on, blast off and enjoy the ride of it, you know, and that you were kind of a fool to try to quantify it and package it all together. Do you think that that kind of like set that kind of mindset? Sometimes that means that it's a fun mindset when you talk about like eating some mushrooms, going to a football game. I mean some people who like looked down upon that, but there's other people that you know, that I actually enjoy doing something like that. It's not the spiritual thing. It's not the full blown psychedelic connection that you can make. Yeah, I certainly do. It's fun to write

Speaker 4:          00:14:22       down on that. No, I think any way that anyone chooses to do it is perfectly fine as long as they benefit from it and don't hurt. Doesn't like stab people in the process or kill a dog or something.

Speaker 5:          00:14:32       If it was legal, it would be great because then you would know like what everything was. That would be the best way to deal with it. You the the idea that you just buying stuff from people you don't know. It's so hard to cultivate a friendship. You know where you're trusting someone to sell you something they're not supposed to be selling you

Speaker 4:          00:14:56       again. You get into a tricky situation. They don't both parties to the time. Yeah. Especially with something like lsd where who knows where it actually comes from with something like mushrooms and maybe you're one degree of separation away from the source. It's producing the material and. But with Lsd it could be 20 degrees of separation. You don't even know what it is.

Speaker 5:          00:15:14       You got to be bold as fuck to eat mushrooms in the wild

Speaker 4:          00:15:17       because. Because just to be sure it is. I mean there's a few. Are there few psychedelic mushrooms? It looked like really similar to things that are like super poisonous. Definitely Gallery Ryan and margin Ada, a bunch of the gala rhina mushrooms look a lot like the slow subbies and massively poisonous. Do you imagine how many people have died from that? I don't know. That's terrifying, right? Come on camera. You're in this room. Good.

Speaker 5:          00:15:47       You can just observe. It's just too weird. Have a seat, man. Have a seat. Sit Down with us. We got to include your camera guy. Otherwise it doesn't feel organic or feels stared at. This is Matt. Everybody mad at the camera guy. He's here as well because I'm Hamilton is doing something on isolation tanks and we're going to check out the float lab tomorrow in Venice where a crash. My friend Craig a crash is a mad genius putting together the baddest float tanks in the world. We're going to go check out his stuff and his crazy cellular influence device.

Speaker 4:          00:16:27       When did you first learn about the flotation tanks? Is this something that you knew for awhile or did? Yeah, I mean, I mean, what? What? What gave you the idea to, to, to make do this project? I've always found them interesting. I think they're pretty fascinating for anyone that's studied the history of psychedelic drugs, just because John Lilly use them in such interesting ways and also at the very beginning of psychedelic research, there were always these attempts to try and isolate the experience from the environment in some way when they were trying to quantify or qualify the different effects of new drugs in the sixties and because it's a class, it's so much based on the environment they wanted to try and figure out a way to remove subjects from the environment and test them in some kind of an unbiased setting. And the two ways they had were sensory deprivation tanks in these Ganzfeld devices.

Speaker 5:          00:17:19       No, no. So, um, you sit, you were talking about it earlier. You've, you've only had one century and it was quite awhile ago. It sucks that it's not more readily available, you know, I think, uh, if you could just get into it for a little bit, you know, if you get into like a regular thing, like even just once a week, that's great man. If you could find a place that has it

Speaker 4:          00:17:43       and it's like a massage. I bet like I just recently got my first massage and I always kind of went, you shunted off just because it seemed

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       weird to me and I got my first one. Now I get it, you know, it was just nice relaxation, you know, it's not that expensive. It's really good for you too. I think it's really good to have someone that be affectionate to, even if it's just, you know, even if it's just, you know, someone rubbing you with their fingers, like that's really, really intimate. You know, we're pretending that it's not sexual because it's not touching your growing. But when some big fat, sweaty woman who really knows how to rubberneck when she's getting in there with lotion and everything, the ladies fucking giving you affection, they're giving you affection. The rubbing your legs when someone's rubbing your feet. Yeah. They might as well be blowing you when they're getting their heel into the little children, little children, to leave the genitals out of the picture because that's the person who's doing.

Speaker 5:          00:18:35       They're being affectionate to you. You're paying them to be ultimately affection to you because yeah, it works the muscles. And yet increases, you know, a blood flow and yeah, it breaks up scar tissue. It's great therapeutically, but it's also great because it's affection. What if they finished it off with like, like rocking you in a chair where they held you for like 20 minutes at the end and they were just like playing with their hair at the very end, like a baby or something. That's how that would work. This is like that extra $10 they'll do that. They said to do the whole thing. I remember there was a place I used to go to and they, uh, they arrested one of the dudes there because he was a, he was given dudes massages and blow jobs. He was like blowing a lot of the gang guys.

Speaker 5:          00:19:24       And so they caught him the win. I'm like, look, he's just trying to make his customers happy. You know? What is customer one? Exactly. I mean that is what the guy wanted. He wanted to do it too. Who got hurt there? They should have that for everything. Well, as long as it's really clear that that's what you want, right? Because if you're like a straight guy and all of a sudden he's blowing you and you're like, dude, wrong signal. Yeah, but if you're a gay guy, fuck. Really? We try to stop that. Why we try to stop that. Hamilton Morris in 2012. Why math? The camera man. Matt the camera man. You can talk, brother. You're allowed to talk. So it's crazy seeing the internet all blacked out today. Like say Google and Reddit and a tedious Hamilton. Yeah, I noticed it. What did you think about the soap?

Speaker 5:          00:20:11       A thing? I haven't read enough about it. I mean, I think it's horrifying if it is what I think it is, but I'd like to do a little more research. You can even read about wikipedia was blacked out. It represents a trend. It represents an attempt in whatever it is it's trying to control or having the ability to control the Internet, but reality is they can do that. Now, if the government wanted to step in, like if you had some crazy al Qaeda kind of website up, they can shut you down and trust me, it's not gonna do anything but create an underground tunnel. We're all going to use and it's going to be really. You're just, you're, you can't lose. You're going to lose against the Internet if you tried to do this anyway. If you tried to start banning websites, if you tried to like start monitoring people, they're.

Speaker 5:          00:20:58       The Internet will find a hack for it. Just like they do every single iphone that day before it's released. You know, maybe, maybe, I don't know. Who is they? You know, who's been, who's ultimately going to be in control of it and what you know is it, is it really? Is that what's going on? I don't think there's a vague. I think what's what's happening is people were realizing as more people get more access to information, that they're not buying the bullshit anymore and the only way to stop that is you're going to have to limit their access to information. You're going to have to be able to control them. You're going to have to be able to somehow another box them up. You gonna have to be able somehow to. The trend is giving information freely through these fucking cell phones and wireless Internet connections and they're coordinating meetings and then people are setting things up and they can't stop it.

Speaker 5:          00:21:43       They can't control it and that's driving them crazy, but they can also work through the system. Like when you think about how many wikipedia entries are written by the pharmaceutical companies that are the. You know, how much wikipedia material is actually advertising in one way. Really. I mean, of course, if anyone can edit it, who wouldn't take advantage of the incredible resource? Yeah, I would imagine. Yeah. I mean it's not all good. It's not. It's not perfect, but it's the best way. The best way is let the Internet sorted out. The best way is not the government controls the Internet. That's the worst way. That's the worst way possible. A bunch of people are willing to go to war. They get to control the Internet. Fuck you. No, you don't. That's crazy. You fucking resource hogs. You can control the Internet to Jesus Christ. You know you'd steel in minerals in Africa and stealing oil in the Middle East and trying to jack the Internet.

Speaker 5:          00:22:34       It's the same motherfuckers got. Damn it Brian. I blacked out my website today. Did you really? Yeah. I don't know how to do it. Yeah, it didn't really poorly and quick. I just changed the logo. Made all the texts gray, dark gray. Do you feel like you're a part of the movement now? I feel a little left out. I feel left out. Well, NBC would probably be pissed off at you if he did that. Probably if I blacked out my shit. Yeah, because I mean the people that are asking Sofa is all the big media giants. You know all that Darlin's that want to. Google's not back. Wikipedia is not entertainment studios like Disney. NBC. Well, yeah. I guess they will be the ones who could benefit from a crackdown. You've got to think about how much money has been lost. Now there's my question. A lot of people have gotten things that they didn't deserve because they kind of download them illegally maybe, but how much money was lost was really any money lost of wonder. I wonder if like I wonder if it didn't exist with those people have gone out and bought it. Is that what you're saying? Or would you say maybe they just downloaded it

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       on a whim and maybe if they like it they might tell somebody else, maybe somebody else. My buyer. Like it's possible that it's not causing any loss, you know? I mean, I don't know. It's definitely a lot seminar. If you look at go to a movie theater nowadays. It's not like it used to be. People are downloading shit. You think that's what's going on for real? Hey, I, I hate to admit it. I used to do it. I used to know I downloaded every single movie allegedly that came out that weekend. Allegedly. I mean I might be a character, an idiot. I'm scared to like a typical guy on the Internet, you know? Okay. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24:23       I don't think it's. I don't now I don't do that shit. I don't think it's that, I think if, if the movie theaters are empty, it's because of the economy a and because of the movie is suck. A lot of movies suck. It's hard to find good movies and that's the problem. Like it's, it's weird going to the movies nowadays and taking a girl on a date and spending $80, you know, it's like, wait a second, what happened to like $6 movie tickets instead of $20 movie to cause inflation bitch. But that's what I know. But that's one of the reasons. There's a movie theater that's in Pasadena by the ice house w that we walked by and yet the movies were like one or two weeks old. They weren't first week, maybe they weren't old yet and they were like, I think $3 tickets.

Speaker 1:          00:25:02       That place is cool. What's the name of that place? I can't remember. It's off of Colorado. I love when you find a place like that. Yeah, it does something cool like that place, like just slightly old movies. Really cheap. Super cheap. That's how. Yeah, I can wait. I'll wait. I'll support your cool business and it's kind of a retro movie theater. It's not new at all, like it's old school, what you remember in the eighties when [inaudible] came out and you're like, Ooh, coolest movie experience Evermann we were playing at the Houston livestock and uh, who is that stupid movie that they made about, uh, some kids in the woods and it was like a witch Blair way. Blair witch project, right? Isn't that it? That it was like a fake documentary style, which we wanted me and Chris Mcguire watch that. These guys came down to the show and then afterwards one of them worked at a movie theater and he said, you guys want to go see the Blair witch project?

Speaker 1:          00:25:55       Like right now just to us. I was like, Oh shit. So it was me and him, my buddy Chris and a couple of his friends and we just alone in the theater. He turned the thing on, like he literally had the keys and we watched the Blair witch project alone. Wow. That was fucking awesome. So the only way to watch that thing was it was the perfect way to watch that movie and I tried to watch it again and it was fucking terrible. Second thought, it was terrible. I tried to like, I dunno, recreate the moment. Did you hear that Mcdonald's has to now put up signs saying that their French fries cause cancer that there. Yeah, it's in, it's something that's in French fries, potato chips, coffee cigarettes at the chemical was produced through the browning process. You know, like when they put the fries in the Fryer, it causes cancer. Like that Browning Browning of what the, I guess

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       the oils that are in it or whatever. And uh, so they have to put up signs and I guess there's ways around it, like they don't have to use do it the browning process or they could do it the baking process. But that of course would take long. The thing with fries, it probably makes it super clear. It's interesting, there's the browning process and it kind of makes sense because you know, they say that if you eat meat and you eat it like, like, well done. Like the carbon, the outside, it's like really not good. It's like the, the, the, the black shit that people love the crispy outside. It's like really bad for you. Yeah, that's the worst part, right? I think it is a fucking weird people, men. But they're so delicious. That's the most taste, best tasting cancer ever. What did you say that's the best tasting cancer.

Speaker 5:          00:27:27       Oh, by the way, a lot of people got mad at us because of this last podcast. I had a fucking bunch of annoyed people with me on twitter. Why? Oh, I don't know man. There was a couple of people that are annoyed that we're vegans and one guy might have overreacted to because I just get tired of people in their Hashtag. I'm Vegan, like they say something and then go vegan. And he was a saint because we were talking about um, uh, animals getting killed in processing plants. It does happen, you know, groundhogs, all kinds of animals die know it's not when you buy plants from a store. I mean, unless you're a grow your own organic setup and you're doing it all yourself, chances are in the harvesting of the plants, some animals are going to die, unfortunately even more. What's that? Maybe even, I don't know if it's different.

Speaker 5:          00:28:15       It's like mice, these, these, uh, you know, the area is going to be devastated unless you have some like, really good setup or it's like, you know, great composting. I mean, unless you're doing it all yourself for your own food, if you're doing it all yourself for your own food, that's one thing. But if you're buying some shit from whole foods or from wherever it's coming from a farm somewhere, even if it's organically grown, you don't think some animals are getting jacked. Oh yeah. There was an article about doe in Australia at least it's a, a greater total loss of life, but it's a different type of life if you're a vegetarian than if you're an omnivore because, uh, because of all the mice that are killed in the process of harvesting Greens. But I dunno, it doesn't totally make sense. But again, I don't, I don't think this is where they're not ridiculous.

Speaker 5:          00:29:05       They're sensitive people and I can understand that. Excuse me, I can understand that, appreciate it. But it's, um, it's just, it gets annoying that I'm Vegan. It's like it's this self self righteous air to it and there's a weird thing that it's okay to live, to eat some living things. It's okay to kill trees. It's okay to kill plants. It's okay to kill fruit and vegetables. Okay. To kill that. You can kill it. You could chop that fucking let us read out of the ground and it's debt and then you eat it. That's okay. But it's not okay to kill an animal like, well, when do you, when do you draw a line? Is there any distinction that would. If the animal was just meet, it was just meet with a heartbeat and he couldn't think and it just sat there. If it didn't, if you didn't need it, somebody else would.

Speaker 5:          00:29:49       Is that okay? At what point is it okay to eat an animal and other life form? Is it only stuff that can't move already? So we're sensitive people. What you should be asking for the like even responding to that because who cares what other people eat and what their views on. You know, I think there's certain cruelty associated with factory farming and I, I agree with this gross. It's horrific. You know, I try to avoid. I try to avoid cheeseburgers except in and out, in and out. It's pretty fucking spectacular. Five guys burgers. I hope those cows were treated well. If I had known they were treated well, I feel much better about it. But the reality of you by Kentucky Fried Chicken, are you by any sort of meat product, from any fast food, anything you're buying something that did not live a happy life, you know it's going to be the cheapest meat they can possibly get you.

Speaker 5:          00:30:44       Right? I mean, isn't it right? Africans fiberglass, right? Like, look at Taco Bell's meat. I don't want, you know, I don't think vegans are silly. I just don't agree with it. I don't agree with it. And I don't think we should be. I don't think we should be treating animals the way we treat people. I think we should be kind to everything we can be kind to. I definitely think factory farming. It's fucked, but I think regular farming, it's pretty goddamn natural. I mean, it's what people have been doing forever. Yeah. As long as you're not abusing the animals, it's, it's what people have been doing for forever and those animals. I mean, who's to say that you're not supposed to take out cows? That's silly to me. Someone's going to take them out. Is it a Jaguar? The Jaguar is and take them out. Can people take the cow out?

Speaker 5:          00:31:33       We can't. You're talking about extremeness though, unlike most people don't believe that even even most like normal anti cruelty animal companies or whatever they're called charities, uh, even them, they still believe in, you know, humane killing of animals. But the, the, what you're talking about is people that are just like nothing. No, you can't. Well, there's definitely grades, right? Yeah. Yeah. And that's only a small amount of the people at Joe's, like you're talking about like the three twitter, twitter followers or whatever is. But it's, you know, it's a significant chunk of the population. I think there's a lot of people that are like really upset at any idea of any cruel to whatsoever the animals and you know what man is because they love their animals. I totally get that. I did love their animals and I totally get loving wildlife, but you know, the idea that they're going to live forever if you don't eat them.

Speaker 5:          00:32:21       Like, what the fuck's happening here? No, don't eat animals ever. Okay? Who's going to eat them? Then block them. The fuck's gonna happen. You're gonna, you're gonna. Go around and gelding them. You gotta to make sure that these elk don't fuck because otherwise they're going to be everywhere you ever go to. There's a town in Colorado called Evergreen, beautiful, beautiful place. It's amazing. It's up in the mountains and it's, um, you, you, uh, there's a certain part of town where you can't go anywhere, uh, at a, uh, during certain migrations because the elks, we'll just walk down the main street. It's fucking amazing. There's like a hundred elk. There's a photo of them and there's like a herd of them and they're walking down the middle of the street. It's like, wow, what a crazy place where you live, man. A herd of elk, just Walkman.

Speaker 5:          00:33:13       You know? If, if it wasn't for people shooting, those elk herd would be 200. The next year it'd be 300. There's not enough predators. Like unless you want more mountain lions, unless you want to start bringing in mountain lions in your daily equation, you've got to do something to get rid of those elk. Look, they have to shoot those fucking things. We want to live there. You're going to have to shoot a deer or fucking terrifying. If you've ever been in a place where deer are like super plentiful and you can't drive safe now Ohio, it's ridiculous. There's deer flying all over the place and there's. You wake up. Normally I would wake up at my, at my dad's house when I lived at my dad's house and see a deer, like, like every week I would see a couple in my backyard. Yeah, and if you're driving home at night, that's the main streets are right next to my dad's neighborhood.

Speaker 5:          00:33:55       So I mean obviously that's dangerous. Yeah. Somebody is going to eat them. You got to eat more of those. Yeah. I've never actually had deer. I've never had any of that craziness. You've never now I sending you're vegetarian or anything? Oh yeah. How long have you been a vegetarian? Since 2009. But occasionally. Is it a um, health choice or is it a, um, I think it's just generally encourages me to be more conscious of what I'm eating because otherwise I'm more inclined to eat, just gross fast food and things like that. And I think my diet, it's improved enormously since I became a vegetarian. Yeah. The more plant matter you can get in, it seems like you just feel better, feel healthier. But goddamn need is delicious. I eat what ash occasionally do. No red meat or anything along those lines. I have my theory that the, uh, said it before, that the stuff that's the quickest is the best for you. Like deer, deer is really good for you because they're hard to get those motherfuckers they run because they got like really good meat cows. It's pretty good mate. What's tastes like? I don't know because it has to be the best.

Speaker 5:          00:35:07       Get a Cheetah Burger. Oh Damn. People will be like, no, don't eat a cat. Yeah. Isn't that funny? I bet you, but nobody wants you to eat a cat. You can't go hunting tigers and eat the tiger. Tiger meat was fucking delicious. People will like you dick. But meanwhile that tiger would hunt you dummy. I'm not saying tiger should be extinct. I'm saying if I lived in India I would think tiger should be extinct. Not necessarily, but definitely if I lived in the. I say they've canceled alone. What about big ones? Man? Man. Leave him alone. Fucked up bro. You ever see a real one? You just have like a cat thing that you would have to do at tiger about to attack. You just throw. It was like a piece of paper the other direction and run, you know, or something like that. That will work.

Speaker 5:          00:35:54       It probably does. There's probably like, like in, in their instinct that they will do that. Yeah. I wonder if there's like any people that has ever tried that. Dude, I can't even believe you're asking that question. It might be DNA stuff. It might be. You got to high before the show, just a red ball when clients come in and see what happened at Hamilton Morris. This is a ridiculous show I brought you onto. I apologize. But then again, I don't. It's fun. I'm just kidding. Um, so you, you've been doing this a vice.com thing for how long now? Since about 2000. Seven. Two thousand eight. Is that full time your thing? No, I worked for other magazines as well, like writing stuff, writing for Harper's as well. But vice is the main. What was it like when you sat down with that a shogun character? What is that guy's name?

Speaker 5:          00:36:52       Alexander Shogun. Yeah. And he's like some crazy super chemist. He's really brilliant. He's, yeah. That was an amazing interview and that was really different, you know, people kept writing me saying, Oh, you're so lucky. You're so lucky. But it was incredibly difficult to get that interview with them and it took. So it wasn't like a luck thing. Like I just like, hey, we found a Kooky guy for you to interview. Go visit him. I had to, had actually been to his house a couple times beforehand and I had to be vetted by his family and all of these things because a lot of people don't understand what he does and uh, and he's harassed by people. There's this ridiculous idea that inventors are somehow responsible for what is done with their creations. So people think that if somebody dies of an MDM, a overdose, that he is somehow responsible for it, which is of course totally ridiculous.

Speaker 5:          00:37:41       Wow. But you know that mentality. Yeah. There is that mentality which is pretty silly. The legalization of any of this stuff would require people to go over dosages and be scientific about it. And if, if, if any of this stuff was legal, it was legal. If you could just be prescribed for being prescribed, if you could have a doctor that would say, you know, you're pretty sane. I think you could handle ecstasy. So he prescribes you a little ecstasy. Go have a party this weekend. You know, I don't know about that. But I think using it as an adjunct to psychotherapy is not that far away. Well, you think so you really think they're gonna accept that there are certainly trying to. The organization maps, that's pretty much what they do. Yeah, I'd read that. They've made great strides with people as well with posttraumatic stress disorder, which is not surprising. I mean I think a lot of this stuff that maps does, it's just proving these things that most people understand intuitively, but it has to be demonstrated in a rigorous scientific fashion before and the regulatory authorities will accept.

Speaker 6:          00:38:40       That would really help a lot. No doubt about it. They would restructure society if, if people would allow. We're allowed free use of psychedelics. Everyone looks at it as such a frivolous issue, like so silly, you know, like why, why, why and concentrate on such things. What a tiny do. Trying to get high. You know, if you talk to most people about psychedelics, you feel like you're stuck in the 19 fifties movie. What are you trying to do with your life, kid? What do you want to do? Mess with those mushrooms. Put that stuff down, get yourself square, get on the straight and narrow, but the mushrooms down boy, isn't it? I mean, doesn't that seem like that? It's a. it's not a subject that's easy to be approached. Seriously with adults. There's not a lot of them that will engage you in it. In the regular world. You want to talk seriously about psychedelics and seriously about positive effects of them and mushrooms and know who wants to talk

Speaker 5:          00:39:34       to you about that stuff. Yeah, I mean now most of it has to be shrouded in scientific research. What if you were working for an insurance

Speaker 6:          00:39:41       and you were like one of their top sales guys, but you're running around the office telling everybody that got to do acid. You know,

Speaker 5:          00:39:50       I guess I don't even really know what public perceptions. I mean I have an idea, but it's so hard for me to go into like to really understand what it would be like in middle America or something if you worked at an insurance office. Well, I think it's different now everywhere because of the Internet. I don't think there is necessarily a middle America that's the same middle America there, there, there were some innocent parts of the country or countries where things were a little quieter or slower.

Speaker 6:          00:40:16       But I think because the access to information that people have today, I don't. Kids can learn a lot of shit online. Even if their environments socks, they can develop and be engulfed and whole communities online and they can evolve so much quicker. So this is like groups of people that evolved like in small towns now that would have, they wouldn't have existed to three decades before. You know, I think that's, that's one of the big differences between now and you know, I try to think about what it must have been like to be my parents to grow up. You know, the Internet doesn't come along until you like

Speaker 5:          00:40:55       way too old, barely getting into it. You just go on CNN.com and check things and whether the big thing. I remember going to the library all the fucking time. Like that was like the cool thing to do. Random movie. Go get a book. Libraries must be fucking hurting right now. They're not doing as well as they've been doing before and why libraries are doing great. I think so really? I would just think that it's easier to get information without going to the library and now my mom doesn't even go to a library morning. She would go like multiple times. Most people have access to a computer. Then there's all these subscription services that are too expensive for people

Speaker 4:          00:41:33       that are individuals to use. So it's like if you want to use factiva or scifinder or lexus nexus or any of these databases, scientific databases, you have to go to a library or awakened me. Right, right. Of course. So if they're always going to exist in some form, it would be too expensive.

Speaker 5:          00:41:48       There's reading books is a different experience than reading a kindle. I don't know why I'm mad. I don't know why. Oh yeah. It's kind of better. I don't know why though. I don't know why I like turning pages, you know? I don't know why. I feel like I've actually thought it with me. I think it's softer. I think once the technology gets up, which is already here, but went to get the technology because we can kind of feel like a cottony feel or I use a kindle, I use a kindle, right? I mean I do have one of those things, but if I had to choose between that, like if I had the book and it was on the kindle, I would take the book with me. Do you smell your books before you read them? No. You'd never seen, never smell your book before.

Speaker 5:          00:42:30       Do you ever smell your book? I have no books before. I like that little muskie. I shouldn't say I've never smelled like smell when I'm reading. We have. It's cool until kindle has that ability to like holding your hand in it. It's its own thing. Like that book was great and it smells a little weird until it has that kind of real feeling to it because right now it's just like you're looking at a piece of glass, like a words on, on a screen. It's, it's you disconnect from that. The last used book that I bought was a, the sacred mushroom and the cross is the only way to buy it. You was used until young Ervin just rereleased it and data. Did you. You've read that right? I

Speaker 4:          00:43:09       familiar with it. I've read part of it and read it cover to cover and I've read part of the second book as well was at the end of the road or something like that.

Speaker 5:          00:43:18       It was a sacred mushroom in the cross and then there was the other one was goddammit. Turn back time. Something in the Sea Scrolls and the Christian myth. Something along road.

Speaker 4:          00:43:29       Yeah. Yeah. I do home care before a sacred mushroom and the cross. Is it just A. Yeah, it's Bible scholar.

Speaker 5:          00:43:35       Yeah, that's a, that's the idea. And then he, uh, he was the only one who believed that it was all about mushrooms that the entire, the Christian religion, like a big part of it was about fertility. Rituals and mushrooms.

Speaker 4:          00:43:50       Yeah. But even that you, I don't know if you're familiar with the book, shroom by Andy Lead her or letting her know. What's that? Oh, it's good. You should definitely check it out. It's really a pretty impressive piece of research, but he in the book and then he goes through all of these different mushroom myths, but he talks about a sacred mushroom in the cross and claims it allegro never even believed that, that that he was just so. He hated Christianity so much at that point in his career that he just was looking for some way to disprove it or dismiss it or make it look ridiculous in the public eye.

Speaker 5:          00:44:22       Whoa. That's awesome. If that's true. Holy Shit. Damn for it. Part of me doesn't want it to be true because it's such a great story. I really. You could say, look dude, the Bible was about Dude's tripping on mushrooms and I really wish it could say that and that's what Rick Strassman is trying to do now with, at least with the Old Testament in dmt. We're really. What is he saying in psalms speak relatively recently, and he said that he has a new career goal, is to go through all of the old testament looking for instances of altered states of consciousness that might be indicative of some kind of a dmt type experience. Well, yeah. Yeah. There were some recently. There was some guy. I'm a scholar from Jerusalem that was proposing that about Moses and he was a. The Moses, his encounter with the burning Bush might've been some reference to the Acacia Bush, which is very high dmt content. Absolutely. Yeah. No, that's how he saw God. Yeah. I've already got a legit scholar. I forget the gentleman's name, but he was a legit scholar who is bringing up this connection to possibly know psychedelic experiences. And then I've also heard a theory that the ark of the covenant was a Meth Lab.

Speaker 5:          00:45:41       That's awesome. That's a fucking great quote. That's a kind of quote you here and you go, damn, I wish I wrote that. Your architect covenants a meth lab. Do you ever hear those people that believe the Ark, the Ark of the covenant actually exists and it's in, um, what part of Africa is it? I don't know. I only know about it through Indiana Jones. I've seen the photo. That template. Is it? Ethiopia, Ethiopia. Good. Graham Hancock was one of the guys who, uh, that's what got him interested in, uh, these, uh, alternative views of history. Zeros, I believe it was Ethiopia. And they have this area that's guarded and these, these, these monks, it's guard that they have like a 20 year lifespan. So powerful. It's so sexy. It's really. Shit was true. Uh, you know, I really, I don't know if it's true, but I don't want to anybody to disprove it.

Speaker 5:          00:46:37       I think it's been investigated. I think the discovery channel or someone did a special. I really haven't. I wanted to do it thing. What Hancock had said was that no one was ever allowed to get anywhere, even close. Maybe it's politics. That's what he said. But here's the map of it on Indiana Jones to, during one of the cutaway scenes where it's just like that, that plane, a dotted line, just find it through there. I don't think it works that way. Could you just completely interrupted my train of thought? I don't know where I'm going now. You know. Let me, have you ever heard of [inaudible] Lane? What is he? And it's that America's oldest brewery and it's in Pennsylvania and it's used to be this beer that living in Ohio. People I know would go to and stock up with truck folds just so they could have it for like a year. Why? Uh, because it's, you know, it's really good. It really is. It's older than Budweiser. Budweiser came out, supposedly stole their Eagle Logo. Is this a new sponsor?

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       Worked in doors. You can't even buy it here in California. So they stole the Eagle and Budweiser stole the Eagle and used it in their logo. And now you decided to come to Ohio. Uh, the first week sold out the entire, like, like ipod style, like they had to build a whole new thing on their factory just for Ohio now because I had an everywhere you went beyond that, that's all everyone served. Everyone else was drinking that. It was like the craziest thing seeing in Ohio when he went back home, everybody was drinking this beer and it's fucking pretty good for just like a Shitty, cheap light beer. But everybody was drinking. That's how bad Ohio sucks. They get excited about some shit. Beer Budweiser's heard get so fired up and they band together to support some shit. Beer Budweiser's hurting from it. How bad is that?

Speaker 1:          00:48:15       Beer? It's a really good. Come on. I wish I could give you so many. You could probably get in Chicago. No, you probably can't get. I like Sam Adams. Is it like that? Uh, they, yeah, they have different kinds. They have like lights, they have lawyers. They have. I mean it's, it's really good to work for them. Place the oldest brewery. It has to be the best. They're going to fucking like the first one. I don't know what's going on here. I think he's. I think he's broken into an impromptu commercial note. You'd like it trial if you ever get the chance.

Speaker 5:          00:48:39       Alright. Pennsylvania for finals is a impromptu commercials. Not only do I swear to God, Dude. Get the fuck out of here. Don't play anything from. Okay. I believe it. How dare you never heard of it.

Speaker 1:          00:48:53       I know either did I don't give a fuck. Beard. That's crazy though. But the budweiser story was really interesting. I thought like how they took the logo or the mascot.

Speaker 5:          00:49:02       Eagle. Dude. Everybody wants an American Eagle. What about goodyear tires? Will they have an American Eagle too? It was not an American Eagle in there somewhere. What about the same as. Wow. It's pretty close. It's crazy. I mean, there's a slight difference. Budweiser is the led Zeppelin a beer. So that's what you're trying to say. Maybe they stole it from Budweiser, you know. No, no. They've had it longest subtle who? There wasn't even a company when it came out. Settle down. Son Hamilton. Morris. I apologize for everything. Everything you've experienced so far today. And this, uh, strange ride.

Speaker 5:          00:49:40       Um, so, um, do you want to do this, um, thing about isolation tanks? What's your, uh, your goal when you try and get out of this? I'd like to use one of the tanks myself. I want to try specifically those tanks that you were talking about earlier that have some kind of an auditory and visual component. Yeah. He's got that all set up, man. He's got it set up where he's got videos of it. Were they using the sound and they're playing like music and you could see the waves in the water because the speakers were actually like floating in the water and they're, they're like set up right by your head. And the waves are like making the water splash and jump and wiggle. It's pretty fucking tripping, man. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty trippy thing that's going to be also affecting your body while you're in there.

Speaker 5:          00:50:26       You know, you're going to feel sound on your skin. Yeah. Fuck yeah. You will get it. Yeah. You're going to hear it in your, in your ears and you're going to feel it on your skin because it's like moving. That's moving through the all the water though. The whole thing is rippling while they're doing this. It's really pretty one. Wait until you hear it because your ears are under the water. Here's the under the water and it's not distorted by the water. I don't know. Could be on big notes as possible. Things like really splash around. Well, what does that feel like? That's to feel nutty. I'm curious. Yeah. His idea, Scott crashes, idea is that he's going to develop, um, like how to tutorials for sports and for all sorts of different things. Music, language. They'll be able to teach people language is much quicker and that in the sensory deprivation environment with the lack of external stimuli, your brain will be more focused.

Speaker 5:          00:51:20       So it sounds like it does sound like the lawnmower man. You're right. It does. Does he do these nootropic injections beforehand or something like that? That's what he should do, right? We've got to give them some fucking nuclear shit. It's like an x men type situation. Yeah. The, um, the idea behind it is fascinating. You know, the idea that you can program the mind better inside the sensory deprivation state. It really makes a lot of sense and it seems like it would work that way if you really get someone really knew what they were doing to design some cool programs, you know, we think that would be like the best way to learn ever. Especially if you learned something cool, but it'll be a would be distracting your concentration and the campaign. That's what I would think if you got comfortable with it. See the thing about the tank is once you do it for a long time, you know you do it a couple times, like four or five times.

Speaker 5:          00:52:13       Once you, once you do it, he know what it is. You can just settle right in and once you settle right in, then stock it distracting at all. It's going to be wild as fuck floating there, watching some just image appear right in front of you because you can't really see that the light is so dim that all that comes through is the actual image. You can't see the outline of the box. Have you ever been to one of those group massages where there's a shitload of people in one room and then they're playing like, like a movie that's on loop, like on the wall of like a house, you know, in Asia somewhere like a bird's flying. See, I find that annoying and distracting. If it was pitch dark, I think I would be better for sure. And I think that's how like when you're relaxing and one of these isolation takes any kind of, you know, sound or anything like that, that seems like it'd be distracting.

Speaker 5:          00:53:00       You're absolutely right. It would be. And I have never gotten into the video or audio thing that's scarred crashes thing. I like to go in and just chill on my own. But I think it's fascinating. I mean I'm not opposed to trying it. It sounds really nuts. And if he could ever figure out how to really hook it up and do it right, I mean what a great way to like learn a language or something. And what a great way to like, you know, could you imagine if you took, like if you found out that you could develop a course specifically for use inside the isolation tank, like the optimum way to learn things and memorize things and put them to use and you show that you could make people learn Spanish 10 times quicker, something fucking nutty like that. So you wolves on loop at night, like walking slowly just to go against your fears and stuff like that.

Speaker 5:          00:53:50       Yeah, if you could really get it to the point where it becomes a Hologram, that would be the ultimate entertainment experience. Dude. You're living in a hologram. You get in the isolation tank and they put whatever Hologram you want on. Yeah. Okay. Let's do the Amazon jungle. Boom. That would be wild. Wouldn't be wild. And you get to watch like a movie. Get to watch a life take place in front of you, sister, act to someone to about you. Don't even paying attention. That's what reality is going to be. Eventually it's going to be, you know, opera. You know you're going to have options to be able to choose where you want to do today. Give me an eventually. It's got to get to a point where we can construct reality. I mean, I know that they've, they've devised artificial realities for video games. They looked pretty fucking spiffy.

Speaker 5:          00:54:38       You know, when you're watching a good video game, like, like what is it like metal of honor, one of those games that were there, that's the name of it. It's one of them called call of duty in comedy. You watch those, those video games like that's the graphics are fucking absolutely incredible out. How long is it before they can project that into your head? How long is it before? Instead of looking at that amazing thing, someone figures out how to projected into your head that's going to happen and when that happens, that's going to be an alternate reality. They're going to be able to program it alternate reality, and if you, if your consciousness, if they can figure out a way to lock your consciousness onto that alternate reality, it's almost like putting you in another world. It's almost like putting you in another dimension.

Speaker 5:          00:55:24       Yeah. Is that possible? I think it is. Yeah. That seems like what's gonna Happen, right? Primitive forms of it are already possible and things like that. Those implants for blind people that allow them to see what the camera and the go. Oh yeah, I've heard about that. Into their brain. Jesus, you can input visual stimuli instead still probably far away to everyone can do it like xbox seven, $7,200. Right. It's like how we look at like the old cowboy style photographer dude who had to throw that thing over his head, remember and he had the big torch on his hand and it would go off. Do you remember that? Like when like all the wild west movies, the guy would like have to get under a tarp and shit to take a picture. Do you remember all that? And think about what that was. There was like, there was no fucking movies like shut up. They could barely get an image. Everybody at a stand still, you know, you had to like really wait, like how long did it take to take that picture? Yeah, took a little time, right? Yeah. You couldn't just move around and wasn't like instant. Think about that was only 200 years ago. Right. That's amazing. That's fucking incredible. That is 200 years ago and now we're complaining.

Speaker 1:          00:56:31       I wonder if all the shenanigans that happen, like having to sit there with your family and then like one of the kids would fart and you know, there was probably all these little things that always happened during those photos. You know, still there was probably some humor that, that was lost and that we went after to that anymore to hold their face. Right. I liked a lot of blurry pictures from the. Oh yeah. Usually the kids. That's why the kids are always the malaria post photos is that his people would walk in and out of the frame and you made nothing. Drives me crazier than fucking ghost TV shows. When I watched those ghosts TV shows and I just go, you're not gonna find anything while you fucking with me. Never find anything, there's never been a bigger cock tease. Then the ghost reality genre and they're on like season three or something like this.

Speaker 1:          00:57:21       Like, look, can you see this? ECTOPLASMIC enters the room. It's like a speck on the screen. It was like this. This is where the ectoplasm enters the room. This is where the. What the fuck did you say? Like you asshole, you know they have a fucking ghost ghost hunting. You're not fighting shit. Shut up. Every fucking shows. The same thing. There's some people in a dark room watching something through night vision and someone goes, what was that noise? And then they go to commercial and then they come back and it's nothing. It's ridiculous. My mom, I just got back from Ohio. My, my home, my mom's house is supposedly haunted, like, like my sister used to always talk about it and then my mom is now talking about it and my Stepdad, he's like, he owned the architect firm and he's a really smart guy, you know, huge corporation this guy had.

Speaker 1:          00:58:07       And then he retired and he's a farmer, you know, he's just a very intelligent guy. And he said he saw it the other day and then so it's just like, all right, you guys, stupid fucking gas leak or a mining leak somewhere that's giving you likely he's fucking your mom. Right? That's what if you came to me. Okay, what if there was like a sour well near my mom's house farm? What's going on here man? I said, well, she's probably a little wacky. I think there must be something, some kind of feelings going along with her. Radon gone bad. The might be man. You know you grew up at a desktop radon radon test in your basement. Do you remember? How about the shit that was on apple's. Oh yeah. What was that? That was that, that chemical. They use the spray that fertilizer on. Is that what you're talking about? Remember, there was a something

Speaker 5:          00:58:57       that was on apples that were saying was dangerous for it. Do you remember that? No. Fuck Shit. What was it? And I was. I don't remember what the fucking chemical was. I'm sure twitter will let me know on twitter. Somebody please tell me what's the fucking chemical was something or another. Oh, all something you remember, something like that. I know exactly what you're talking about. Wherever

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       my dad actually has a patent to get radon out of your basement that he used to build these machines for rich guys that like only you these so like maybe 50 of them is totally legit. No, it is. It is legit. Yeah, it's definitely an element. I'm sorry. It's hidden in people's homes. Is it a health issue

Speaker 4:          00:59:45       really, really have to worry about. I don't think so. I don't know. I've never heard of anyone I knew dying of radon poisoning, but how did they get brought up? Do you know? How did it become an issue? I guess some people died somewhere. Well at some point they must have and it does exist. It is a element that leaks out of the earth and news that you've radioactive gas that's nasty.

Speaker 1:          01:00:06       So it's just a natural part of. Yeah, no, it's not a result of nuclear testing or anything like that. It's a totally natural way. So do you think that people died because there's just some areas where it would just come through and heavy doses and no one anticipated it? Is that what it was? I think it's heavier than oxygen, if I remember correctly in sort of settles on in basements and your floors and people sleep impulse of it and just. And you can get radon poisoning, but you know, it starts in your respiratory system and then you just start like wheezing and coughing a lot and shit like that. It's actually pretty crazy that it was so popular, but then it just died off like they were still probably getting this. They did. Did they find something new? Like oh by the way, right. I'm poisoning is actually just now. It's all about outside. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:00:54       All it takes is like one death somewhere and then all of a sudden everybody starts chasing after him and he could have been one extreme example that was very, very rare and then everybody started chasing it and it's sensational stories. If you have one good story about someone dying from some invisible chemical or even a drug or there you go. He's going to drug

Speaker 1:          01:01:14       I won Pennsylvania to highest lauren's. That's where their beer. So good, isn't it?

Speaker 5:          01:01:17       He's men. When you, when you stop and think about that. So many of the different things that you've talked about are not illegal, you know, different psychoactive substances. Like when you were talking to a Shogun guy, like all the different things that he was talking about, the different tryptamines and how many of them are illegal. A lot of them are

Speaker 4:          01:01:36       illegal. Five mud, apt DMT. Lot of them are maybe 11 or 12 of them, maybe more. Probably about a dozen. Tryptamines are illegal schedule one. Uh, yeah. No, it's ridiculous. And a lot of them never had any real popularity in the first place. Drugs like doe tea or something, or tma two were never particularly popular substances.

Speaker 5:          01:01:59       Could you imagine if something like five Meo dmt killed as many people year cigarettes does? Wouldn't that be amazing? Could you imagine how people would react? What a crisis they would be. We've got to get this off the streets. Did you imagine with me one on one cigarettes, do it. It's like, well, you shouldn't have been. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:02:20       whoops. Whoops. Yeah. I mean, I wonder if nicotine would be legal if it were a recently discovered substance. Probably the nicotine is not as much of an issue. I think there's. I think a lot of is all the other shit they put in them to make it even more addictive. They say that if you smoke cigars, you know people that smoke cigars, first of all, you're not inhaling it, but you're getting like a real pure type of tobacco. It doesn't have chemicals on it and it's supposed to be not nearly as bad for you. It's not great for you. It's not the best thing for your sucking on a crazy fucking plant that gives you nicotine all day, but what it is is a better, healthier version of that tobacco and that the 599 different additives that the food and drug administration allows cigarette companies to pump in a cigarettes to just to make a mostly make them more addictive. I think. Believe that movie with. What's his name? What's homeboy's name? Fucking gladiator. Dude was so crowded, so grow. Remember that movie played a dude who was like the scientist who knew too much about cigarettes, used in a real story that was terrifying if any of that stuff, and I moved, I can't even remember the movie, the movie's name or the actor's name,

Speaker 4:          01:03:26       but they don't even need to. I mean nicotine is incredibly addictive without any kind of mysterious additives, but then there's also the Beta car booleans in tobacco that may give it an additional addictive component because they may improve mood.

Speaker 6:          01:03:40       When that movie he was talking about, and again, I don't know how much that movie's dramatically. I think it's based on a real story though, isn't it? I'm going to him. I remember I remember it being based on it or something like that. It was terrifying to think that a company would be so evil that they would go out of their way to try to use chemists to make their shit more addictive and you're like, wow. Like that's a. that's a really nutty choice. Five hundred and 99 is a lot. When you find out they have 599 different chemicals they add to cigarettes.

Speaker 4:          01:04:11       We're at one of the editors don't really even make sense. I've looked through the list that don't really stand wind eight shoes like what dean or. Yeah, purity and would be an example disappeared. Then it's an aromatic six membered ring with the nitrogen in it that that is just smells really bad and you wouldn't think that it would have any maybe to counterbalance just tons of stuff. It's like all these different. Just bad. That's all it does as far as I know. And the quantities that they would be using it. I can't. I mean maybe it's like a in a really, you know, in the same way that like Indole and very, very, very small quantities. Smells like jasmine, but then in large quantity smells like shit. So some of these things that smelled bad, it's probably used for smell to, to sell a cigarette. Smoker doesn't smoke and they smell a cigarette. You want a cigarette? Bad. Really? One hundred percent. It's like having an apple pie. When Apple Pie comes out of the oven and you smell apple pie, you're like, fuck, I want that Apple Pie. Same reason. They're probably making a smell,

Speaker 6:          01:05:08       well, I don't know if they're making it so attractive to people, but they'd probably making it more attractive to the people that are smoking it. It's weird that it'd be a stinky thing. You say a stinky thing. It's probably a mixture of different of stinky things that

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       make the semester. Some of them were just smells and so who the fuck knows know? Like I said, according to the Russell Crowe movie that I can't even remember the title. Right. They like done some deep research on hooking people and deeper and deeper with all these different 599 chemicals. It's just ridiculous. That's too many. That's a lot. It's very complicated. It's ridiculous. Even when you're looking at the interaction of two chemicals and once it becomes incredibly complicated, think they constructed that lead me your. You understand that field. How did they do that? I mean, I'd have to look through the list of all the additives, but I don't know. I mean, it could just be, you know, even things like any candy that any child eats probably has an equivalent number of different chemicals in it. Um, you know, people that the word chemical always sounds bad, but it was 599 chemicals, but there's a guarantee, 599 chemicals in this, in everything, in everything. So it depends on how you want to phrase it. I don't know. I'm sure the majority of those chemicals are benign, but maybe 11 of them do have some level of function. The are based on some tobacco industry plan to addict people, but I really do think that nicotine in and of itself would be enough. I think those are the people that smoke those natural cigarettes, those like in what do they, do they experience less addiction?

Speaker 1:          01:06:36       Uh, no, actually I, I think that's where he hit me harder. Like I wake up spitting up like buckets at boobs, you know, like just like having roommates hooks them. And is it just a major film producer? Maybe it's like a, maybe some chemicals that cigarettes make, make it so that Burns easier. Oh yeah, definitely. I mean like, like what most people smoke I would say is Marlboro lights or camera lights or a light cigarette and it's more like having a diet coke. It's just like, you know, you just want a little taste of the chemical and a little smoke, but you're not. But then you get these guys that are like smoking. Marlboro reds were. It's like having a little cigars, you know, it's harsh. It's.

Speaker 2:          01:07:11       Have you ever seen the wonderful whites of West Virginia? No. You've never seen it? What is it? It's a crazy documentary that uh, they did all these people that live in West Virginia that have been notorious family of outlaws and wild people. And there was a woman and her name was sue Bob and I swear to God that was her voice has always been a sex. He wanted a family and just go and you just stop and think about that. So lifted cigarettes do to her man. What did cigarettes do to her? Nobody sounds like that when they were a woman without cigarettes. Like it's only cigarettes that they give you that. I mean, maybe some crazy exotic disease, but that's what she sounds like. It's amazing. If you've never seen it, man, if you just want something silly to watch, it's so well made. It's a beautiful documentary. Johnny Knoxville's production company put it together. It's really awesome. It's about this family. They're just awesome characters, man. They just live in West Virginia and they sell pills and they're just always getting arrested. It's just wild, man. It's so crazy

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       to watch. It's really, really fun. But cigarettes. Fuck that chick's voice up. You did. We didn't talk about that. That guy that. Uh, what's his mic? Fannie Mae, Fannie, whatever that guy's name is that's running for president in the marijuana. A Mitt Romney, Mitt Romney man. Alright. Yeah. That about him in the marijuana patient. We remember we were going to talk about that. Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy. I talked to you about it before we even did the show. It was so. It was so sad to watch someone. It could be so callous about his ideas like that when some, if you haven't seen it, Mitt Romney, guys running for president. Very, very wealthy man standing in front of this dude in a wheelchair. Guys like 80 pounds, man, I think he said he had muscular dystrophy. I apologize if I'm wrong about that, but you know, he said to Mitt Romney that he needs medical marijuana and that medical marijuana is the only thing that that helps him. And Mitt Romney said, have you tried the synthetic form? And he said it, it makes me vomit and marijuana is the only thing that helps me. Would you put me in jail if you became president? Sure. Let's play it. Let's see if it sounds good. All right, let's see if it sounds good. It's really depressed and old video that just really just became popular. Really. Okay. It's so good.

Speaker 7:          01:09:51       I have all my life, my doctor saying that I want to that medical marijuana for everyone and you have synthetic marijuana that's available and other that I have tried it and it makes me throw up. I have tried all the makeup and all the forms that come in after high stimulator. The steroids. I have muscular dystrophy that's completely against my DNA. I'm sorry to hear. My question for you is will you arrest me and my doctor's medical marijuana? I'm not in favor of medical marijuana. How are you?

Speaker 8:          01:10:33       She just turned away from the politician. Smile. Hi, how are you? He asked if you were going to arrest patients like him. Governor, you're going to just ignore a person in a wheelchair. I spoke to them, but he didn't answer his question. All right, well this is good.

Speaker 5:          01:10:49       So disturbing. This is what we're doing. Hamilton Morris, I think you got a good voice and you should run for president. Yeah, I'm pretty sure you could pull this off. Why not? All right to it. I don't think he's enthusiastic. Not Patronized. It's shocking though, isn't it? That a person like that could be like even close, remotely close to being able to run things the bit that you would be so

Speaker 6:          01:11:14       cold hearted. Just walk away from that dude like that. That's like a serious issue, man. You got to address that issue. This guy's telling you there's something that helps him and he's obviously in terrible, terrible straights. The guys fucked up, man. He can't move, his body is in a God damn wheelchair and he's telling you this. Something happened against this, against his will. This is, this is something that he's saying helps them make them feel happy against his pain, and he even said, I'm not for legalizing it for anybody. He goes, not for everybody, but for people that you can use it for medical purposes. It works. It's you just walk away from God like that, you know? It's just disturbing that anybody would be so flippant with the idea that it's, it's so. It's so preposterous. It's so gross to them for some fucking reason. I don't know what it is, but the idea of altering your consciousness anyway, other than the sanctioned ways that we've prescribed to for the last several decades, anything that steps outside of that becomes a danger. I don't know why, man, why you told me, man,

Speaker 4:          01:12:18       I dunno. I mean it's not a majority view. I don't think. I think it had to do with a few people who, you know, when you think about it only takes a few people to make these enormous changes in drug policy and like, I don't know all that much about the history of marijuana specifically, but it was like that one guy primarily. And then with the psychedelics, it's the same kind of deal. It takes one person to die at the wrong time and you know, one person dies after smoking. Salvia, the guy, Brett cit, esther, and then it's illegal over 10 states. Dude died, smoke itself, you know, he didn't even die. I mean, there's, there was a teenager named Brett cit, esther who wrote in his diary, I love Salvia it, uh, but I also understand that life has no meaning now or something like that.

Speaker 4:          01:13:03       And then a few days later he killed himself and his mother looked in his diary and said, oh, it was the Salvia than even suicidal and went on this crusade to have it band in every state that she could and was successful in something like a dozen states. It's called Brett's law. Wow. But that's the way it always is. It's always one person that there's like the that act based on the person that bought morphine on the Internet and overdosed. It just takes one promising. All the mushrooms and the Netherlands are now illegal because of care off the girl that jumped off the bridge. Just one promising person whose photo looks good on the news dies. And that's the end. But what did she do? She got mushroomed up and jumped off the bridge. It's unclear. I mean that was the, the official idea that was written in the news.

Speaker 4:          01:13:50       But then when I was in Holland recently working on this new project for VBS, we were at this place called magic truffles, which is the largest mushroom, or was largest mushroom farm in Holland. They make metric tons of mushrooms in this factory. And, but then mushrooms became illegal so they converted their entire operation to producing psychedelics. Clarissa. But they say the whole thing is a scam. They think that, uh, that she wasn't even on mushrooms at the entire thing is based on a friend seeing her with a box of mushrooms in her hand. But on the day of the death and then they put two and two together and decided that she must have been on mushrooms, which he died. Oh God. So she could have just been depressed. Yeah. I don't think there are any toxicology reports that confirmed she was under the influence of any psilocybin at the time.

Speaker 6:          01:14:36       I can get not wanting to give it to everybody. I just think there should be places where you can get at where someone could walk you through it and you should be able to make an educated choice. There's just so many people shouldn't be denied the experience because I think the experience makes people more aware and more sensitive and that. I only think that that's good. I think the world can use a lot more aware and more sensitive. So why aren't there centers set up? Why is it still illegal? That's where it gets completely, totally ridiculous. It gets to the point where you're. You're keeping something that might be beneficial to a lot of people because some people might fuck it up because some people might fuck with it. Do something crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:15:15       It also has to do with fashion in science and medicine, you know, it became very unfashionable in the eighties to do psychedelic psychotherapy and uh, and there were only a number even in places like there certain parts of Germany where any, any psychiatrists that wanted to could, and they chose not to just because most people weren't interested in it for awhile. They thought it had limited potential and now I think the potential is, you know, there's the renewal evolved, the psychedelic research, but in the eighties people didn't think it was even people that were pro psychedelic drugs, they just didn't have, a lot of them didn't necessarily think that it was a viable road to producing important neuroscientific research or in terms of psychotherapeutic drugs.

Speaker 6:          01:15:59       Yeah. I recall hearing a Mckenna interview where he was talking about that, about how scientists were often like discouraged from going down those paths because people would say like, you know, there's not really nothing there for you.

Speaker 4:          01:16:12       Well, yeah, it's hard. It's hard to. It's difficult to quantify the benefits of psychedelic drugs like a lot. There's a lot of anecdotal evidence that they have lasting effects on people's lives and that they have relief from depression or alcoholism or things like that, but when it comes down to really, really putting it down on paper, it's been difficult and an often it's things like the Johns Hopkins study where silicide been occasions long lasting mystical experiences. That famous paper, a really recent one. Yeah. The reason why it's getting a huge amount of press, but it's amazing. Yeah, because they said that it improved their personalities. Yeah. But even that is kind of slippery when it's a mystical experience. All these terms are slippery and if you, you know, when you look at a nootropic that was very defined studies of how something does it aid road into navigating amaze, does it allow them to, does it allow a human, does it prevent the formation of certain types?

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       Disease or proteins in the brain are things that that are indicative of neurodegenerative diseases, but there isn't anything like that for psychedelics. There's no single benefit that can be quantified. And uh, and I think that's one reason that it's difficult for researchers is. And then there's ways around it with now a lot of people try to emphasize the positive effects that are not necessarily psychoactive, so maybe they have some kind of an immunosuppressant effect that would be useful for our, uh, for arthritis or some kind of inflammatory disease or something like that. That's one of the, you said that because there was something I was reading just a couple of days ago about people juicing cannabis and that doesn't have any psychoactive effects, but there's a lot of great health benefits. Absolutely. Using it in cbd, the non psychoactive Terpene, one of thc and cbd are the two main chemicals in.

Speaker 2:          01:18:05       So would you juice it like a smoothie, like blended up? Oh, I don't know about. I don't know about this specific technique, but cbd is not psychoactive and has all kinds of a medicinal effects. Like it's currently undergoing clinical trials as a treatment for schizophrenia. So I mean, in addition to the psychedelic effect, there may be all kinds of things we can, you know, maybe neuro regenerative, maybe synaptic Magenic, maybe all sorts of different things. The marijuana one is the biggest trip because it's got so many excellent properties yet it's illegal. It makes the best paper. It makes the best clothes, like the fibers. Excellent. You can make like wall board out of it. There's like four times stronger than plywood. It's like a really incredible plan because it's super strong like have you ever picked up a hemp stalk? It's really weird, man. It's like from another planet because it's really fucking strong, but it's light.

Speaker 2:          01:18:55       It's shit. Like you pick it up and it's like this is a weird kind of wood. If it seems strange and it has so much fucking potential as far as like you could like you can grow like a massive forest full of it, chop it all down and then have another massive forest like six months later, a year later when it's renewable, you could do it over and over again and all the health benefits, all that. It's like it's from another planet. It's really crazy drug. When you think about all the good things it does, it's great and it had. The seeds are awesome source of protein. It has all the essential amino acids. It's actually good for you if you juice it, if you smoke it, you get high, you feel amazing. It's like it couldn't do any more for you. Come on man. You can make paper out of me. You want to make clothes out of me dude, you can eat my oil. My oil is really good for you. It can power cars too. It's like I'm renewable every six months. I mean it's like it couldn't be any nicer to you. It couldn't be any more of a productive plant. Know as far as like society just uses as you know, as a quantity, as you know, uses as a something that you could sell. Absolutely. And it's the same thing with mushrooms as well and if so many benefits beyond just being

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       vessels for carrying these psychoactive drugs. You know, I think Paul stamets did a lot of experiments with the Defense Department using either a p scion essence or as their essence and using them to d phosphorolate, seren to break breakdown nerve gases because in the same way that all of these enzymes in the mycelium that are able to break down the cellular components of the substrate, whether it's wood or grass or some kind of seed, it's able to break it down and extract all of these amino acids and then bios synthesize chemicals out of it, but uh, but it can also break down all other kinds of substrates, like there's all this bio remediation where they use mushrooms to clean up oil spills because the mushroom mycelium is able to break down the aromatic hydrocarbons in the oil and to totally detoxify. You can even eat the mushrooms afterwards. Wow. I, I'd heard of it

Speaker 6:          01:21:00       about something like that, that they use things like that in Alaska. Is that what they experienced? That, where that was the before the Gulf incident. That was like the last big,

Speaker 4:          01:21:09       right? Yeah. They tried to. They wanted to do it in Japan as well too, to clean up radioactive waste because you realized the mushrooms to bioaccumulate radioactive fallout and then pick the mushrooms and slowly decontaminate and area. I mean it's an extremely slow way to do it, but it also effective. Wow. It would take hundreds of years. Well, what other options are there? I mean that's the thing.

Speaker 6:          01:21:31       Imagine that's the best way to do it, but then once you get the mushrooms to eat it and then you have to pick up the mushrooms. The mushrooms are still radioactive, right?

Speaker 4:          01:21:39       That's right. For how long until the decay of the radioactive atoms. Hundreds of thousands of years. Yeah. So it's essentially just moving the problem to another area. Yeah, but at least you're concentrating it. It's better to have like a 20 drums of radioactive mushrooms in a concrete vault somewhere than to have it covering 100 miles of land

Speaker 6:          01:22:01       eventually. Panting is so terrifying to me because I have no understanding whatsoever how nuclear power works. I just always took it for granted. You never even thought about it. I never. And then I just recently found out that it's about making steam. It's about like somehow or another loop, the nuclear thing. It's like the power comes from Steve Powers things, steam turbines, steam turbines. I'm like, wow. That seems like so old school, you know, it's just, they're using this super powerful fire to boil water. You know what I mean? It sounds ridiculous. I mean, my, my simplification of it sounds ridiculous, but when you find out that their spots now where there's just no one's ever going to be able to go there. And then when you can't go there, you can't go there. That's fucked for forever for. We probably won't even be people anymore because you know, 100,000 years ago we weren't even this, right? We were like barely this as a, as an organism where we're essentially a little bit more of a monkey than we are now. By the time that shit's done, what are people going to be like? By the time that's not radioactive anymore, we're not even going to be people anymore. We'll probably be some new shit. We all have autism

Speaker 2:          01:23:05       and it will probably be just like the grays dude, just crazy. Something like that to the graded trip. He's going to happen. We're going to be assimilated with the machine. Yeah, that's my conclusion.

Speaker 9:          01:23:17       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:23:19       Assimilated with the machine. What do you think's going to happen? Something's going on.

Speaker 2:          01:23:24       I don't know. I mean, I don't know. Think about it. I do think about it. I just don't. It's difficult if anything seems possible. It's just like with any. Any issue where it seems as if it could go one way. I certainly am a pessimist ultimately, and I'd like to be an optimist. Are you a pessimist as far as the potential that the human race can reach or as you put about the possible outcomes? Are you a pessimist about people in general? I mean, I got into an argument with a Daniel Pinchbeck recently about, about, about aliens, and he has this very optimistic idea that if aliens. He told me he goes, definitely exists. He, he believes a lot of things that I definitely said he's very open.

Speaker 2:          01:24:06       Well, I enjoyed talking about before we say anything further. Oh yeah, no, I enjoyed talking to him. Yeah, just playing. But uh, so, so what happened, aliens. We were talking about Stephen Hawking and Stephen Hawking has this idea that if we ever do make contact with aliens, the best move would be to ignore them because if, if they ever come to our planet, the chances are they're not only going to exploit us but destroy us. I mean, you didn't say exactly those words would. He generally has a, a pessimistic view. And I think that that's a well informed intelligent view. There's no reason to have an optimistic view about that, but Daniel Pinchbeck seems to have this idea that, uh, that, you know, touristic Gilliam friends and we'll drink sweet. So sweet. Um, I don't think so. Look at, if you look at every single organism that we can observe on this earth, it takes advantage of the week or organisms, including the most intelligent.

Speaker 2:          01:24:58       We take advantage of dolphins. We put them. Absolutely. That's exactly what I was saying. As we look into killer whales, we don't give a fuck. We put, we locked them up in tanks and we know they're intelligent. We just can't understand them, and so we forced him into slavery that's not mentioned humans to humans, the keys to the doors and we we, but with animals that we don't understand, intelligent animals, we understand. We regularly enslave them for people's enjoyment to watch on television, and then we believe somehow or another that some super intelligent organism is going to show different behavior than what every single organism on this earth, including the highest us, the most aware us. We do it worse than any of them. We do it worse than dolphins. We do it worse than killer whales. We have chimps. We locked chimps up. We don't give a fuck. You make humane people. People that love to still keep them in or people that love champs, keep them in cages. People's love. Dolphins keep them in tanks not literally kept himself into the tank, so even if they were trying to be nice to us, who's to say that it wouldn't be some nightmarish. It's fucking hell for that dolphin, man. It's got to be hell. They're. They're intelligent. They're just. They just can't change their environment. We know they have dialects and they have crazy Alexis societal and you

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       know dolphins have. There's this, they have a huge attachment to their family and their loved ones to just snatch one up and stick it in a fish tank. It's fucked up, but we do it. Why would we think that aliens wouldn't do that to us? We are crazy. Could you imagine if you came down here and you watch all these little pink monkeys with their fucking bank stigs and nuclear weapons. You found out that people had nuclear weapons. You know, you see him at home, slack, jawed watching the Kardashians. We have nuclear weapons, the same animal. You know the same animal and it's all going on right now.

Speaker 6:          01:26:36       Imitate aliens who is probably cute. Want to shut this whole fucking show down? You'd be like, you're going to ruin this whole planet. You stupid fucks. You would want to come as we would for sure. Shut this planet down. If we came into an area and there was a budget champs and the chimps had machine guns and tanks and we would shut that fucking place down. There's no way we're going to let some chimps start running shit. We would take all their weapons. We'd go Jesus Christ who gave chimps these fucking tanks, what chimps do and flying around in jets. We would totally steal their shit. Who would never allow that image of chimps started coming into our towns and stealing our cars and shit. There'll be a real issue. We wouldn't allow that. We would take our shit take from those dumb monkeys and that's what they would do.

Speaker 6:          01:27:23       They would come down, they would steal our cars or iphone. Excuse me. That. How'd you figure this out? You fucking dummy. They would take your iphone. Oh, check you out. Look what you did. Did you figure this out? Think about the average person. How stupid there. And they have an iphone in their pocket. Boom. And they don't know how to use it. Yeah, so pinchbeck thinks so they would all go IOWASCA style. Yeah. They would have a song prepared. Hello humans, we want to. We prepared this for you. We will eat at the buffet is the day the Earth stood still the other day? Have you ever seen that? I have been since I was a child. Wow. It was amazing. It was like I was watching a movie. It was Kinda cool. You know, it's kind of cool because you know, you put yourself back in that sort of like old school comic books, style of storytelling. They did in the fifties and the innocent days when they made that movie. But the other thing was like, oh, how naive like the portrait of like an alien, what it would be and you know, just how naive the situation was in the military and every obvious bad guys and good guys, like how naive but yet,

Speaker 4:          01:28:30       how do you know who even now there's really no impressive concept of aliens. That's what. I don't know if you're familiar with this science fiction writers Stanislaw Lem, but he wrote Solaris and his master's voice and all these books in. His main idea is that humans can't conceive of anything that is truly alien. We're only looking for ourselves in the universe in anything that was truly unlike us. We couldn't even imagine.

Speaker 6:          01:28:51       Right. So even like the movie alien still isn't thing. Not even like it could be a living ocean or living planet, write a plan, and with consciousness,

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       that's always been a fascinating idea that everything has some sort of consciousness, you know, whether or not a expresses pain or even feels it or can't communicate that everything has some sort of a, a type of consciousness will definitely. Our idea of life is generally very narrow, like a budding field of astrobiology, which is just a speculative science, but even in astrobiology textbooks from a couple of years ago, there would be no mention of the possibility that, uh, that arsenic could replace phosphorous in bio molecules. It didn't even seem like a possibility. And now we know that that can happen. How does that work? What, what happens? There was like a, a lake, I think it's in Nevada that had extremely, extremely high levels of arsenic in the water. And this researcher is last name is felice. I think a collected bacteria from the lake and found that they were producing dna and amino acids where the phosphorous atom that's present in a lot of these molecules was replaced by arsenic.

Speaker 2:          01:30:00       Whoa. Yeah. I had arsenic poisoning from eating sardines. I told you that, right? Yeah. I ate too many sardines. I was eating learn Qantas or deans a day or so. Funny. Who does that? No one. The only person that likes sardines. Are they a good source of arsenic? Why? Apparently, or at least sardines there they feed on heavy metal or will they don't feed on heavy metal, but they feed at the bottom of the ocean and that's where a lot of pollution as a lot of the heavy metal pollution and they, they get a concentration of arsenic not enough to really to make you sick but enough that shows up on tests. So you get your blood checked and he said, who should have some arsenic in there? What the fuck is going on? Like someone's trying to kill me slowly. Or is it sardines? Turns out it was hard Ns. Hmm.

Speaker 2:          01:30:48       What if you could get turquoise point, like poisoning, like if you like constantly ate a little bit of turquoise everyday. Like if is turquoise toxic. I don't know. It's in stone. Yeah. But if you like, shaved it down into a powder and put it in some proteins and stuff. I don't know. I don't know what the chemical composition of voices, but you just don't study show that doesn't get you fucked up. No, I do. How do you know what? It's the best thing ever. It's a pretty. Maybe that's. That's a terrible question, but it leads to a half decent one. How do you think they've discovered all the psychedelic substances on earth? Or do you think? No, not even close. When I first saw Alexander Seligman's work and saw call, I was discouraged by it because I thought that it had all been done that every single possible psychoactive tryptamine and ethylamine had already been sent in from people who don't know.

Speaker 2:          01:31:35       Picasso is Phil. What is it that I had known then that means I've known and loved and tryptamines I've known and loved in there. These two enormous thousand plus page books written by a chemist in California named Alexander Silgan and they contain, knew least about 100 drugs that he's synthesized and these two chemical classes in each volume and it looks pretty comprehensive. It looks as if he's evaluated every imaginable psychedelic, but that's only a fraction of what's possible. I love that interview that you had with a man because I had never seen a guy like that in the wild. I'd never seen some super chemists. Dude is created like God knows how many common auditory. So how many times has he created something, some new cool thing or discovered some new cool things. It's hundreds. Yeah. How many has he documented? It's amazing, right? Enormous, enormous.

Speaker 2:          01:32:20       Don't incredible. And that he's sitting there just rattling all this information off to you and you were like a fucking kid in a candy store that you could tell. You were like, wow. Like you couldn't believe you were hanging out with him. I'm so cool that the enthusiasm, like it really came through like the your honest enthusiasm to be hanging around with this guy. It really. You had an educated sense of reverence about what he's done. So it's like when you addressed all these things, like you could tell that you had this great joy in getting this opportunity to talk to that guy. Oh yeah. It was really cool. I love him with a passion. He is one of the most amazing scientists. Talk a little watch that. What is, how can I find that? What is it? If you type Hamilton's Pharmacopia, that's the name of my show on vbs.

Speaker 2:          01:33:05       Uh, you can find it on vice.com through the video section if you just look for Hamilton's Pharmacopia. Uh, but yeah, I mean he's in it and I seen him quite a few times since then and it really is a privilege because his entire methodology is one that's not followed anymore. It's like it seems very antiquated to most young people and even pharmaceutical researchers, the idea that, that, uh, anyone would take a drug that they synthesize is ridiculous, but that totally, totally normal. They used to be the way drugs are developed. The chemistry invented Ritalin, took it after he synthesized it and tried it and didn't really get much from it. Then he gave it to his wife Rita, and she loved it and said that it improved her tennis game and so he named it after her Rita Lynn. Oh Wow. But that kind of thing was calm and improved her tennis game because it's essentially like speed, right?

Speaker 2:          01:33:54       Yeah. It's like cocaine or how does that work with kids where it makes them, you know, kids who were really rowdy at calms and down. How the fuck does that work? I mean, there's a bunch of different proposed mechanisms that are kind of complicated. But um, I don't really know how it works. That's always been. I've, I've met a couple kids that are on Ritalin and it's always been a very dark sort of a moment when you realized that these people are drugging their kid, you know? Uh, I don't know if some people need it, but I know some people don't need it. I've seen some kids that are just a little bit rowdy and they need attention and not getting it. Then all of a sudden they're pilled up. That's a disturbing thing to watch. Yeah. I think it's with. Especially with very young children around high school, College Age, and especially when the mom crushed to the down. They snort it like in the wonderful whites of West Virginia. The wild and wonderful wives. They were snorting pills as after friend after she gave birth, she gave birth. She was in the hospital. Remember that? Didn't have seen some of this. Actually. It's fucking fabulous. It's like watching. If you, you turned

Speaker 6:          01:34:58       monkeys loose and let them live amongst people. How they live. They would live like these people. These people are wild. They're fucking

Speaker 1:          01:35:05       why y'all?

Speaker 6:          01:35:06       They're a different breed of human being here. You're in here rattling off all this scientific knowledge, neurochemistry and Pharmacopia and there's people that could breed with you and they're there.

Speaker 1:          01:35:18       My name is access one in the family.

Speaker 6:          01:35:23       It's amazing. It's all going on right now at the same time. Oh Man. We had a guy on a that was talking to us about, uh, about hunting. His name's Steven Rinella. Who was on the last podcast and he was telling us about, he was in Africa and in Africa. He was hanging out with these people that have to hunt for their food every single day and he was out to go with them, but they have an internet connection. They don't really have electricity. They have a generator they can turn on for like an hour or two at night, but I can't. I can't keep it on the can't afford it. It's hard to get gas out there. They have arrows and bows and shit they've made themselves and yet they check their email and you can friend them on facebook. That's all going on right now. At the same time. It's amazing. Yeah. Do we get you to high before the show?

Speaker 1:          01:36:09       Be honest because I think I got too high. I was high for a while. Grandma was. Well, it's also I'm, I'm so fucked up because I just got back from Brazil. Most of my, my brain is on total auto hotel. I am one of my babies was throwing up last night. That sucks. It's sad. So sad. I, I fucked up. I, I flew southwest, which you say I love southwest, but they have that whole number thing, like if you check into late you, you're either a, b, c or d or whatever. How many people get on the plane first they put the a's on then the bees and I did one of those things where you sat. I sat was Columbus to la? Well, Vegas Still La, but I sat between two of the fattest people ever and I'm sorry, but um, they both took up 90 percent of my, my seat.

Speaker 1:          01:36:54       So the whole time I'm like, they were in the middle and the other side, so it's like a movie. It was, but I was holding myself like this and you know, my, my elbow pain that been in, I am so jacked from that flight. That was the closest thing to torture I've ever been and I couldn't do anything about it. You can't do well. Didn't they kick Kevin Smith off? Yeah. How big were these people? Pretty big. Kevin Smith, the, the, the, the, the guy was bigger than the girl. But the problem was the guy, he had so much room to lean on the window, but he decided to lean on my side and so the whole time he's like, oh, he's on my lap on the east. And the woman was trying to be a little bit nicer about it, but she was still pretty big. So she was on my space like our C, that's a human rights issue. It's fucking seats for two goddamn slow. I need like a rape whistle would slip right in. You can just go sideways and those families couldn't even touch you. You'd be like a sheet of paper between pure red rocks. Yeah. Yeah. I have no problem. There should be a whistle for them.

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       We have an issue with people are getting too fucking fat, you know, and it's been going on for a long time. There's a, there was an image once that I saw online from the early 19 hundreds and it was one of those carnivals and it was the Batman and the carnival, like there wouldn't be the guy that was the fat man and he was barely fat. I mean, in comparison to what we consider fat today, like some of these people that you see that have to get moved out of their house, they have to cut a hole out and they're attached to the couch because they haven't gotten up. They'd been shooting where they sit in their fiber, their skin has like melted into the fucking chair. This is not just one person. This is many, many, many people have done this. It's been a bunch of people that they had to cut their fucking house open so they could pull them out attached to their couch.

Speaker 2:          01:38:37       You know, and this was just, you know, 1,919. Oh three or something show fat man. And he was like barely fat. It was like barely. Who was a guy who should go on a diet, you know, who was like not, you know, Joey Diaz when he was not even at his heaviest, like halfway there, halfway between joy. So it's like that's just a shorter amount of time ago where it was really rare to get that fat. It's amazing. It's amazing how far society, his sled or how far humanity has slayed when it comes to that or our bodies are exploding. Like it's so common to see people just overflowing out of their clothes, you know, fast food. It's corn, it's a lot of it. Corn Syrup, right? Isn't there a documentary on the corn is really terrible for your body and difficult for it to break down.

Speaker 2:          01:39:30       That's why they feed it to cows and shit and get them fattened up before you before you slaughter and makes them more delicious. Yeah. I don't know. You should be diet drugs from easier to obtain as well. Oh really? Yeah, definitely. So you think when. Well, I know one girl I saw, I saw one girl lose a shitload of weight. She lost like 50, 60 pounds. She went from being kind of Chubby to like really hot and it was like whoa. And it happened so quickly and she was on something called Phen Phen you remember that? Yeah. That stuff Jachter though. It just totally short circuited. Are cardiotoxic dangerous. It's crazy. Yeah. So she went right back to her normal weight again. It was like she was a hot chick for like a year, that phen phen kept it rock and for like a year, but it was just too, too nutty, you know, the store with them was to every stimulant they've used as a diet drug.

Speaker 2:          01:40:19       These teas, methamphetamine used instead of me and they used 10 metres, the views, anything you can imagine, any stimulant and just anything that they could sell you to make. We're going to loose the stimulants, do work and fen phen worked, I'm sure. And do those things that you see like, you know, ripped fuel and all that shit or they are, those are those diet pills or those things affect it? I don't know what's in them. I mean if there are, some of them have weird derivatives of finesse, Colombian, you know? Yeah. What does all that stuff? This was just amino acids. Is that what it is? No, they're just probably really weak stimulant.

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       Like thin ethylamine is a close derivative of amphetamine, just missing one carbon atom and uh, and it's illegal. So you can just put tons of it into dietary supplements and it produces a short lasting stimulant effect.

Speaker 6:          01:41:11       It's amazing that that's one of the number one concerns that people have getting rid of fat. So it's it. It's a very strange statement when you think about how society becomes so successful that even when people are down in the dumps, they're still fat. There's still fucking. It's like normal. It's normal to have excess energy stored away onto your skin. It's normally to be prepared for, for your fucking stocked up, you know, in, in the, the wild days. So rare to, to become a fat person, you know, so fucking terrible conversation. You guys checked out a long time ago. I smelled it. All this talk about fat. You know when you have friends that are overweight and you worry, you know, after patrice died, especially our friend Patrice O'Neal's, a standup comedian just recently. You know, you have friends that are overweight and it's just, it's like a bomb and you know it's going to go off eventually. You don't know what you can do. You've got to try to diffuse it. You try to lead them in the right direction or enjoy them until they blow up.

Speaker 4:          01:42:20       Patrice o'neal think that is fatness aided his comedy as well.

Speaker 6:          01:42:24       I've never had that conversation with them so I could never speak of it, but he's. He was really analytical about his comedy. I just think he was also a guy who wanted to do whatever the fuck you want her to do right then and there. Some of the best comedians are also very impulsive people and you know, it can be good and bad. I know comedians will become impulsive gamblers and they get addicted to drugs, so like a lot of them have really kind of wild and impulsive instincts and that's what makes him funny. That be the first person to say, bitch, shut the fuck up. And that was patrice o'neil. He was the first guy that would say he call you on your bullshit. The first guy to say, shut the fuck up and to be that person that doesn't really like worry about how this is going to come out and just fly with it.

Speaker 6:          01:43:06       It's like it's a very specific type of personality. Not that many people do it and they, that personality is prone to doing a lot of other crazy shit to that, that personality, personalities prone to just eat until they're fucking pass out. A personality is prone to do 15 shots and you know on a dare. That's a wild personality. That's a personality. It's going to go with you to Mexico. You know, it's like that. That's the reason why they're funny. So it becomes a. you're sad. Like you see your friend who's really big and you see them eating themselves to death and you're like, oh shit, what the fuck? And I said, you can't say anything. There's nothing you can do anymore than you've already done. You're an asshole. You tell them you love them. Give them a pat on the back. If you need help, come to the gym. I work out with you. But other than that, what the fuck else can you do? It's a weird world. We live in people eating themselves to

Speaker 2:          01:43:51       death. Hamilton Morris. You don't have to worry about that shit. You stay slender with the vegetarian lifestyle on your bare basic alanines, whatever various substances you choose. Do you, do you. Are you a multivitamin guy? You seem like you know so much about the body. Do you, do you take supplements? I take, I take lists that you do. I knew you motherfucker. You're concerned about your liver. It depends on what supplement. Not all of them have hepatic toxicity issues, but some of them do you handle taxes? This is just about not like, it's inherently bad for your liver to take vitamins, but uh, it's part of food, right? I mean that's essentially what I mean. Everything has to go through your liver so they don't, that's not a huge worry unless it's something or some in super high doses of toxic. Like what are the ones who was the lawyer?

Speaker 2:          01:44:44       Soluble ones are, are like vitamin e potentially vitamin A as well. I don't know. It's not something I've done a huge amount of research on, but now when you say fat soluble, if somebody said that once for someone who got caught taking a performance enhancing drug and one of the the people that was in his camp said one of the things that fucked him up was that he's too fat and so he can't get it out of his system as quick short. Is that really true? Like it stays in your fat, like if you are a lean person, you would get it out of your system. Whereas if you were a person that had a high percentage of body weight, it would remain for longer. It's possible. Yeah. I mean that's one of the main physical properties of any molecule is that it has different abilities and different chemicals and some things are lipid soluble and and if it's something like thc and you have a huge amount of fat tissue on your body that the thc can stay in so you just fucking high all day.

Speaker 2:          01:45:41       Certain people, you're not getting high off of it. It's just just in hearing and yourself. It's not doing anything unless it's in the central nervous, just giving you a very mild high, just in my mildest, just cooks in Lindsay's point where it the claim that there's like some reservoir in your spinal fluid or something and if you crack your back the right way, that all really blast of cannabinoids or Lsd or something really. Wow. People would say that. I don't think it's true. Well, there's people that say that Kundalini Yoga practice can lead to psychedelic experiences. Sure. Yeah. Have you ever experienced that? Yeah. I studied Kundalini Yoga for a while during the trip. No, no try. I mean that was one of the ways they tried to sell. I had to take it as part of my sport's requirement in high school and Sports. That's awesome. That is awesome. Holy Shit. That's amazing. Yeah, that's great. Yeah. And they tried to sell it by equating it with a drug experience of some kind and that's why it was so popular in the sixties for that same reason, but I don't really. I never achieved any

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       profound state of altered consciousness.

Speaker 6:          01:46:53       One friend who, uh, had a, a girl that he knew that was a friend of his, that he actually went on a trip with her. They were actually just platonic friends, but they would, uh, traveled together occasionally and she was into like serious Kundalini Yoga where she would get up every morning at a very specific time and she would have to face a very specific angle. I don't remember what it was, was towards the Sun or away from the sun and I don't know what she was doing, but she would do these very intense Kundalini exercises for like an hour, an hour and 15 minutes, an hour and 20 minutes. And she did it every day and she claimed that when she did it for long periods of time, because she did it so much, she could get into like an astral traveling sort of dimension, a traveling state of consciousness where she would have psychedelic experiences.

Speaker 4:          01:47:41       Yeah. Actually, now that I think of it, I did have some. You just forget that they weren't exactly the same. I wouldn't. You've had, you've had so many psychedelic experiences for you to have one in Yogi, like, oh yeah, I have one in that too, but it wasn't really, it was like a, you know, they, they didn't use breathing techniques, breath of fire, and for a normal person having an experience like that would be something they would never forget. Oh my God, did yoga and I had this most incredible transcendent experience. I left my body, I became one with the universe for you. You're like, Oh yeah, I did that during yoga too. So how did it happen? How did that go down? You know, you have to follow these different breathing techniques and then hold yourself in some kind of a weird stress position that's extremely exhausting. And then your, all of your muscles start to vibrate. Like I was on that machine of the turbo sonic. Yeah, like the Turbo Sonic. So it's like a turbo sonic type effect. I would say. I would compare it more to the turbo sonic then to Lsd. Wow, that's interesting. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:48:38       What's the number one thing that if you had to do it again, you would approach with more caution? Is there any. Is there any one psychedelic experience for a loop?

Speaker 4:          01:48:49       I mean, yeah, many have, but I think drugs like there certainly are drugs that are more friendly than others and I think five immuno dmt would be an example of something that has the capacity to be extremely unpleasant if you take it under the wrong circumstances.

Speaker 6:          01:49:04       I had a friend completely flip out taking it because he had. He had eaten and so he had to throw up and he got up to throw up and he got to the sink just in time to throw up, but then he was just going crazy. You're talking about rape, talking about all kinds of crazy shit. Took his shirt off.

Speaker 4:          01:49:22       Yeah. I had a friend lose consciousness and started vomiting and look as if they had died. I've seen. I had a friend read them.

Speaker 6:          01:49:29       My friend Doug Stanhope comedian. I thought we'd lost him. It was going like this and little bubbles were coming out of the corner of his mouth and I'm like, Shit. And I'm hanging out with Doug and I'm just thinking of all the chemicals that doug throws into his body, cigarettes and beer

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       and fucking mean. Doug's shits on multivitamins. He's not taking a multivitamin fuck out of here. So I'm like, we might have red lined his body with this shit. I was like, he just took a big hit and he's. He might, he might be a goner, but he came through it, but it was terrifying for a couple of minutes. You did map them out then? Yeah, almost done, man. I'm, I'm okay. What were you saying about that? Just that you were asking me if there's one that I would approach with caution again in the mail you think would be the scariest one probably. I mean there's also just isolated experiences that you can't necessarily connect with the substance p called there's like an shogun takes this oxygen, less masculine derivative called isocracy and goes into a fugue state where she has a prevailing sense of unreality that lasts for months or something.

Speaker 2:          01:50:46       It just totally feels like she's in a dream. But then I've had friends who also have used unusual substances that have been tested very much and have weird reactions, but every, even if you ingest the same substance over and over and over again, you really don't know exactly what's going to happen with the psychedelics. You taking the exact same quantity of synthetic suicide and over and over and over again a year apart. Every year will feel completely different every time. So I'm always skeptical of people that deals if they really know the effects of any substance because you always completely different. Well, dmt always seemed like there's so much coming at you and there was coming at you from like 15 minutes. Like it was almost impossible to bring back anything. It was almost impossible to record any of it. Yeah. You know, I mean to say that you know, that experience, my God, you'd have to do that experience so many times just to get a general sense of just looking around and just relaxing and trying to absorb it all.

Speaker 2:          01:51:39       Trying to like figure out what the fuck is this? Can I move this around myself? Like what is this? Is this, is this an organism? Is this, is this the universe? Is this the wiring of love? What the fuck is going on here? It takes so long like you do it and every time you do it you come back and then you go, what the fuck was that? And then you go back in again and it's still the same thing for 15 minutes. It's just like it's too alien and too crazy. There's no way you can have a really truly get a grip on it. It's not like you can go on a vacation to dmt land, you know, if you could take a trip, you know you could go somewhere for two weeks and in that two week time you would see the entire time you will be going through a dmt trip. Right. Then maybe you would kind of get a grip on the IOWASCA is some intermediate between smoking dmt and a non intermediate. It's just the longest that you can have that experience and even then you don't really. It's not it lengthening the experience. It gives you some greater understanding of what it is necessarily. I don't think it's really any less or more confusing than smoking it. It's just a longer duration. And even then you have people like Gordon, todd skinner, who are opening themselves up

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       to ivy bags filled with dmt.

Speaker 6:          01:52:48       No, this is the guy that you wrote about in the what, what is it called? Crystal. What? What is this? They'll call, but your. Your article was called high on crystal. Crystal is what? A fucking crazy story. If you haven't read that. This is a must read the other one. The other thing we were, you were interviewing shogun was amazing as well, but you have to see this. This girl was a stripper and she meets this dude who's like this big time lsd manufacturer who has a fucking house in a silo and millions of dollars, right? He's rich as fuck and he's like the number one lsd guy in the country

Speaker 4:          01:53:26       or so. I mean it's also unclear is another example of a story where a lot of people talk about it with an enormous amount of confidence is if they have no understanding of what happened and say, oh, it's all crystal Coles folder. It's all x's falter wise, but if I've learned anything from researching it over the course of years, it said absolutely nothing is certain about the story. It's incredibly complicated and there's so much conflicting information for absolutely every element of the story that you have to be very careful about talking about what happened with certainty. But there was this lab and uh, and they did crystal coal into it and she did become a part of it.

Speaker 6:          01:54:05       She took down the dude. Yes. That's amazing what everyone was crazy girl. Shamana Kalanick. Woo. It's just hundred that she did it. Yeah. It's way harder than she did. I and stuck it up his ass. I don't even care about that. Why did it, how to amazing story though, man. This, this, uh, this girl escaped, right? And then the dude came after and kidnapped her and some other dude, they escaped together to get away from this fucking crazy guy and it turns out the guy was working with the FBI or the Dea. So there's number one, lsd dealers working with the dea and had been for quite some time. Yeah. You know, that reminds me of a story. Do you know who Whitey Bulger is? Yes. You know that store then from acid? Yes. Right. You're from Massachusetts. What an amazing story. For people that don't know, Whitey bulger was the head of the Irish mob and he was also working for the FBI, so if you turned Whitey bulger in Whitey bulger would know from the FBI, first of all, they wouldn't arrest him and then he would kill you and that's really how it ran. I mean, they really did run it like that and you find that out and you go, that is amazing. This is essentially along the same lines and things like

Speaker 4:          01:55:17       it's been happening for a long time, both in the US and internationally. You know, there's the Iran Contra is with this whole scandal about them pumping cocaine into ghettos in America to create the crack problem. I don't know that it's necessarily true, but it's a theory that a lot of people have and the same thing happened in South Africa with with methaqualone, with quaaludes. There was this whole project called project coast where they were synthesizing massive quantities of Mgma and quail ludes in order to weaponize them for crowd control. Supposedly they were pumping them all into the streets and now the ultimate MTMA weapons is a crowd control. Oh my God. So you would blast the crowd with ecstasy. Yeah, it's called project coast. What a brilliant idea. Where do I sign up? That's my bit about how to calm down the Middle East. I had a bit. I did about sending crop duster planes just fucking cover the Middle East with chronic smoke for just weeks.

Speaker 4:          01:56:11       And then they did that as well. Actually weaponized thc. They did at at that. That's the craziest James Gyms. There's a crazy sentence ever. Weaponized Tac. They called it like red oil or something. That was like the code name for it. What does it do? You spray it on people and they become high. Yeah, exactly. That's hilarious. Edgewood arsenal, that's the name of it. Uh, yeah, it probably, I mean that was the, it was not a visit improvement because it's a nonlethal incapacitating agent and you know, if you have a choice between shooting someone and dusting them with Thc, dad's amazing. I can't believe that was a real product. Absolutely. Yeah. What else can they trust you with MDM TAC and they try LSD as well. I mean the problem is also that the physical properties of these different drugs that limit their, their ability to travel through the air to maintain their potency when they're laid on surfaces around the soil.

Speaker 4:          01:57:09       LSD is pretty, it's not a stable molecule. So when they were trying to weaponize it, one of the problems, it's just, it didn't aerosolized well it didn't last on service as well. And then they settled on bz because they thought it was a better chemical weapon. Bz what is bz? It's a anticholinergic drug like Jacob's ladder. The movie Jacob's ladder is really? Yeah. So they really were trying to make lsd and use it as a weapon. Absolutely. What was the idea that, well, what was it going to do to the troops? Just to make them disoriented and you just take them. Well, yeah. I mean, can you imagine if you discovered, if you didn't know anything about psychedelics at all and discovered LSD and they. They tried absolutely everything they could with it. They tried to see if they could use it as a truth serum.

Speaker 4:          01:57:50       They tried to see if they could use it too. They tried to both good and bad uses. There were scientists using it to increase their intelligence and then there were people trying to get use it as to make people insane, to reprogram people's brains. That was the large part of the MK Ultra was about, you know, manipulating people's minds using psychedelics and sensory deprivation and things like that. And it was just crazy trial and error by murderers. That's how they did it. Trial and error by Nixon's people. They should make it into a steam ship. Imagine man, trial and error with Lsd by Nixon's people and supposedly the word trip comes from. That's like FBI lingo from when they were doing the experiments. Wow. The scariest thing that I've ever heard connected to any psychedelic experiences. That was that Timothy leary was connected or not Timothy, I'm

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       the unit Barbara. Ted Kaczynski was connected to a some studies at Harvard and he had done like some classified lsd studies and they, you know, they, they tweaked a lot of people's fucking hands. Then he went back to Berkeley. I taught math for a few years till he got enough money to buy that cabin, take on the technology they might have fried that dude's brain. Oh No. They were love automizing people and they were doing just unbelievable. And if you're familiar with the book acid dreams we had, they did every imaginable thing. Hookup people to ids with stimulant, like amphetamine in one wrist, and you're the second person in a week that's direct recommended acid dreams. I'd have to go get that now. Let's read the first half of it. So it's all about mk ultra different experiences that they tried to important people with lsd and it's about.

Speaker 2:          01:59:30       Yeah, all, all of these attempts to weaponize LSD and to use it as a truth. Sarah and mk ultra buying it right now. You know, it's an old book. It's been around since the eighties. You've heard of, uh, there was, uh, it's supposedly an urban myth, but a French town that they dosed. Absolutely true. It is true. So they do. That's true. And that's more recent research that came up in the last maybe in the last five years I had read it and then I had read a counterpoint that said it was bullshit because you can't even get acid to work in bread like that, that they wouldn't maintain itself. Is that true? Yeah, it wouldn't, it would not survive the heating, but they could've added it afterwards and they supposedly they, I mean, you know. Sure. So when they have to be, I mean, how would you go about getting that acid into the bread?

Speaker 2:          02:00:19       You'd have to get a CIA guy who works there and just just fucks with everybody's bread and squirts it out. Go ahead eat that. I guess so. I mean, you could spray Brad with LSD. Yeah. It was just, it was an interesting argument when I, when I heard, because I had to assume that it was true and I was like saying like, wow, look what they found, and then I saw this counter point to it and I was like, oh, okay. Is it possible that they have, could have created a more stable form of LSD or could it be some other psychedelic that would have similar effects that would be stable? Sure. Yeah, absolutely. I mean there's, there's plenty of psychedelics that they were testing at that time that are more stable than LSD. LSD is unusually in stable, but uh, but yeah, I think the, I think that they recovered some communication between two operatives and I said like, did you finish the mission with the diastal I it or something.

Speaker 2:          02:01:07       You didn't specifically say Lsd, but they used some abbreviated form. So it's not conclusive, but I think that there's strong evidence that that happened. You would think that if they knew of that it would have monstrous effects. They would have to know whether or not there's something that they can monetarily. Well, I think they did that. They want it, they wanted, they wanted to happen, but it seems like such a powerful thing to have. You're going to find out what it's capable of. Kind of just let it go. You're going to have to like try to crack the code and apparently they were like spraying it into the New York subway system. That's crazy. No, it's. Oh, they had an entire CIA or house where they were taking. Yeah. That's operation midnight. Climax in San Francisco and New York. The two different whorehouses. That's an amazing story. I love that story.

Speaker 2:          02:01:53       You gotTa Google that folks because it's amazing. They ran brothels where they dosed dudes. Poor guy. Just killing in there for some sexual relief just to just take. I'll take his mind off. It's horrible day. Hey, would you like to drink honey? He's like, yeah, I just said Jack and coke or do me great jack and coke with acid. Oh No, what the fuck man. They really didn't know them. I mean, they probably had an idea, but there was the anthropological reports of what Indians do when they take pod, but they had no idea how. Just some businessman. Well apparently they started doing it once. They stopped getting people that are willing to sign up for their, for the voluntary tests that too many people were getting fucked up by the tests and so this is what I had read was that they switched to a dosing people when they ran out of volunteers.

Speaker 2:          02:02:42       Huh? I would imagine they would have had volunteers especially later on in these programs and they were becoming publicly known substances, but yet a lot of the early research, there's a book called drugs and fantasy where it's just people being dosed with PCP and I think the France one was like 51 or something like that, wasn't it? It was just something. Yeah. It's really terrifying to think they actually did do that. You believe it. The downs, the whole town. Let's see what happens. You know nuts. You've seen, you've seen the videos of them dousing soldiers. Right? If she ended up, because I believe it was the English army know they just wandering around. It's amazing and people died in that French town. It was, didn't he commit suicide? People jumped off bridges. I mean, I guess it's the same kind of stuff that happens today with psychedelics for certain people respond badly and want to jump off of things.

Speaker 2:          02:03:32       Do you support the theory that that was the cause of the Salem witch trials and all that stuff that it was an Erg got infection. You know that story. Do you know that story? I know that they claim that which brooms or an implement for vaginally administering scopolamine and atrophying and all of these fronts. Delirium, Christ vaginally, distributing with a pole that seems so crude and uncreative. That's one idea, but I don't know about or God in witches. No. Wow. What is it? Um, it's, um, it's, it's, um, a fungus apparently. Oh yeah. I know about it. And apparently it has some psychoactive effects and they didn't get like a poisoning from it and then give you some sort of a psychoactive effect. And they thought it was responsible for a graph. Yeah. They thought it could have been responsible for people that thought they were experiencing magic and they were hallucinating. They were, you know, getting fucked up and, you know, and they could've started blaming it on women, which is, which do, you can't get laid. So you're all fucked up on this crazy bread is Erg. Got, you know, apparently if you've

Speaker 6:          02:04:38       never heard of or got being psychotic.

Speaker 4:          02:04:40       Oh, absolutely. Yeah. No, it is. Yeah. And that's really what is the effect, like what is the effect of or got like, um, well it contains just a variety of these different ergo line substances. But there's lysergic acid, amides and um, and, and they were used medicinally for, for a very long time. That was the reason that lsd was discovered is because they were using these isolating different alkaloids from or got Sclerosia and trying to see if they had some use in, in preventing postpartum bleeding in pregnant women. And yeah, so it wasn't, they weren't investigating psychoactive drugs that had some interest in using them as potential analytics, like drugs to reduce fatigue. And that was this one, nootropic hydro gene was produced by Albert Hoffman in the course of that study, but they certainly weren't looking for anything like LSD,

Speaker 6:          02:05:28       wasn't lsd. There was. There were some, some people that they were looking for something to make women more fertile or something along those lines. What the fuck that I read to something that would encourage women to ovulate? Is that true? Did I read nonsense? I don't know. I mean it happens all the time. It's out of my head. I hate that. I hate when I have a thought that I can't wrap my head around. There's too much goddamn information online. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:05:57       But that happens all the time. And in medical, they'll be trying to create for one thing and wow, that's the story of Viagra probably drove to keep them, to stop them.

Speaker 6:          02:06:06       Bitchin I mean. Yeah, Brian, that's what it is. Let me ask you this, because you're a rational guy that does the stuff. You're obviously very well read. You know what you're talking about. Clearly when you have an intense I could delegate experience and when you experience what seems to be something that is not you, something that you're interacting with that does not appear to be the imagination. It could be, I don't know, but a lot of people, a lot of people have interesting opinions. A lot of people that have seen real intense psychedelic visions have very interesting opinions and you, you might be the most psychedelically traveled person I've ever met in my life, so it's a perfect combination for you to be the guy that answers that question. What the fuck is going on? When you have an intense psychedelic experience, is it just chemicals perturbing your natural brain state? What?

Speaker 4:          02:07:06       I think it's. I think it is, but st just chemical chemicals is already kind of problematic because chemical, everything's just chemicals. Chemicals is absolutely everything you ever experienced and remember remembering I've ever lived, so everything is a chemical phenomenon. Consciousness as a chemical phenomenon. The fact they were able to perceive any of this. We'll have this conversation right now. It's all an amazing chemical interactions, so I don't see the need to bring in any kind of supernatural interpretation of the phenomenon because it just is not necessarily the same reason that I don't

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       see the need to bring in a supernatural interpretation of the universe or or of anything else or even ghosts. You know, you can look at, if you look at a ghost haunting, you can look at it two ways. You can say, oh, this was a weird supernatural experience. Or You could say this was a really weird moment of psychopathology and what psychological mechanism may this person so afraid that they hallucinated and thought they heard something or thought they saw another being, which is equally fascinating, if not more fascinating, or there's a dude who didn't get enough attention from his parents or pretends to see God is in the basement and watch a show with night vision. That could be the case too. I mean, I almost feel like that's the. Like the lesser interpretation. It's the easy way. It's much easier to say, oh, they're aliens.

Speaker 2:          02:08:18       That's very simple. Whereas if you actually wonder what is the true biochemical basis of this phenomenon, it's an incredibly complicated question and it won't have a simple answer, but that's why it's a worthwhile question. Do you believe that it's possible that taking something along the lines of Bmt or any really intense psychedelic actually opens up some sort of a door to another dimension, another place, another exist in something that you can experience another frequency and other station on the dial? I think other dimensions of yourself, certainly I don't know that there's another physical dimension that you are accessing. I wouldn't. I don't see any reason to believe that. I think there's enough inside of all of us to account for that. So you think that when you have this incredible, like massive visual experience, it's all an imagined Tory thing. It's not like your consciousness travels to a place more tunes into a frequency.

Speaker 2:          02:09:18       No, I don't think that. So you think it's just a chemical reaction but in incredibly fascinating, accomplished or chemical and I'm absolutely not arguing with you. I'm not sold on what the hell it is and I've. I've had that argument with people that are really almost like they almost proselytize about the experience to the point where they're, you know, they're talking about like as if it's a religious, a religious, definite, you know, this is what happens, this is what happens. And I've always said, you know, maybe it's possible, but it's also possible. It's just crazy chemicals. It doesn't mean it's not spiritual spiritual benefits. That's fine. It doesn't mean that they don't have, they can't have a religious experience or they can't interpret it however they want, but I sure the interaction is beautiful. If the interaction is beautiful, it doesn't have to be other worldly for it to be defined. You know, the interaction is beautiful. It could set you off on another direction. Rewire your board. I mean, how many people have you ever talked to that have had a big psychedelic experience and totally stopped doing pills, are totally stopped smoking cigarettes or just completely rewired their life because of one like emphatic psychedelic rewiring. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And uh, but yeah, I just think that you think. I'm sorry, go ahead. Well anyway, just the, just the chemical thing, it's just something to be careful with

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       and when interpreting things, no, you're fine. It's just a chemical. Everything is just,

Speaker 6:          02:10:36       I sound too dumb to be talking about the first place. I'm just trying to skate by with my limited knowledge I have, but I want to pick your brain so when you experience like really profound wisdom in um, in psychedelic states or you have like, you know, this almost feeling of being analyzed and like seeing through and shown all your flaws and all your craziness and then you have this sort of like a reset thing. We kind of get a new fresh perspective of your place in the world and how you're, what kind of an energy, what kind of vibe you're putting out. You think that that's all maybe internal, that's all. Maybe imagination or is it, is there the potential that there is some sort of, uh, another intelligence out there? There's some sort of a thing that you can tune into some sort of a way that we're connected to but we don't have access on a regular basis. Is that possible or is it silly?

Speaker 4:          02:11:30       I don't think that it's, there's no reason to believe that that is possible, but I think that there's all kinds of things within us that we don't currently acknowledged and understand. I mean Shogun Shogun and Timothy leary talked about this idea, you know, this is all this noncoding DNA that's sometimes called junk DNA or in Toronto Dna and uh, and although it doesn't, they were probably wrong about that. So it doesn't contain any kind of like instinctual evolutionary knowledge, but, but there was, they were using it as an example, like what if all this noncoding DNA contains instinctual ancient knowledge, they're able to access will or on psychedelics, um, but maybe not with specifically with the noncoding DNA, but with parts of the brain, with who knows what sorts of things are stored within us that we don't know how to access. I think that it is actually a scientologist idea, but I think that there's some truth to the idea that we remember absolutely everything that we experienced, that it's all in there somewhere. You just need the right catalyst to remove that piece of information. Wow,

Speaker 6:          02:12:30       that's amazing. Well, sometimes someone will bring something up and then all of sudden the file will open up in your head and you're like, yeah, that guy. Where is he? What has he been doing? Like boom, all of a sudden some person who you have, I could have come up to you, do you know of, of Bruce Blah Blah, blah, and you'd be like, no, I have no idea who that is. But then somebody shows you a picture and says, you remember this guy, second grade, remember? And you're like, Whoa, yeah, click, click. All of a sudden the file's open and you'll remember several experiences. You might've had that person. It's almost like we don't have enough room for all the shit we're saying. We just put stuff in shitty hard drives and stuff in the closet and then every now and then it comes out,

Speaker 4:          02:13:05       right? I mean, it's like an indexing problem. That information is there, but we don't always know how to access it. You remember that show taxing? Um, I'm familiar.

Speaker 6:          02:13:13       Marilu Henner, remember the very attractive redhead woman that was on that show? No, she's got some crazy memory thing. She was on stern show. She can remember everything. She has an insane memory. Like she can tell you, like you can tell her, you know, June 13th, 19, 76. What were you wearing? She was like, I was wearing a blue dress and because I was on my way to this and that it was.

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       And she'll, she can tell you what the temperature was outside. She can tell you everything. She remembers everything. Yeah, no, it is possible. It's very much in the size of a normal head. Those things are possible. We don't need giant brains and the size of a normal head and she's not even a nut. Like she's like a normal person. Like you talked to her. She sounds normal. It doesn't sound like some maladjusted person with some incredible gift. She's not like a rain man, just like a normal human being, you know, there's. And there's lots of these new modernists that are capable of those sorts of the mind feeds. But uh, and one interesting thing about the new monitors, they all seem to have synesthesia. At least ones that I've read about and uh, so when they remember something, it's a visual memory and an auditory memory and all, and all their memories are cross linked over multiple sensory modalities.

Speaker 2:          02:14:19       So it's like, uh, and then, uh, and then there was a lot of research in the seventies about potentially using psychedelics as cognitive enhancers and I think that's one way that they could function is by encouraging this type of synesthetic thinking where you're experiencing everything through multiple senses, an indexing information through multiple senses simultaneously. What do you think about the controversial, stoned ape theory? Oh, well, I don't think there's any evidence for it, but that's like a lot of parents, we kind of stuff. I like it. I think it's interesting and worthwhile and funny and sexy. Yeah, it's good. I'm glad that he said everything that he said. I don't agree with it. A lot of it, but uh, some of it's a little wonky. Yeah. A lot of it is, but that's not much fun. Yeah, it's good. It's all good. Yeah. And even the stuff that's Wonky, I'm always willing to give him the benefit of the doubt that I just don't see that he seen it.

Speaker 2:          02:15:07       And that's, you know, that's most science anyway. It's just people coming up with theories and models and trying to improve the model. So he came up with a model or theory that was wrong. There's nothing bad about that. He was just stoned ape theory. Is it wrong as far as like the time frame of, of history and development? Like because that's what I've. I think I read that. I read that he got his, his errors wrong or something. Um, I don't think there was any evidence that primates eat mushrooms. Maybe I'm wrong about that. I don't know that. I don't think that. I think the evidence that he was relying on for that theory that uh, either it was LSD or psilocybin increases visual acuity. I don't think that that's been definitively proven science that we've noticed published in a prestigious journal at the time.

Speaker 2:          02:15:50       I'm not sure that all of that research was methodologically sound. You know, what the, how the study works, you don't think they only had like two sticks that were, weren't parallel lines, and then they would have someone turning one stick on the other side of extremely slowly to the point where they would no longer be parallel. And it was who could recognize that the first and the stone people recognized it more than the nonstop people on. So his, his joke was that maybe being stoned, you see the world better than it really is or better than you can when you're sober. Other. Yeah. I mean it hasn't really been studied very extensive. So even though it was published, it could've been horseshit. Like you would have to be replicated a few times. Yeah, I think

Speaker 5:          02:16:30       it would be. Yeah. Um, I, I, that seemed like a weird one too because like, who's going to take a little dose? You know, if you're going to have mushrooms you're going to blast off. I just don't see it being to the point where you're going to take like a little tiny doses of it so you can see better. You know, if you have the blast off thing, you're not going to be saying like, well, what if I just don't blast off? What if I just nibble, nibble, nibble so I can barely feel it? Who's going to do that to go hunting? That's ridiculous. Or maybe they didn't even know that you could play for awhile. Thinking Salvia people don't realize until the nineties until they started extracting it and making those extracts publicly available. People didn't really know their, you know, their chewing and say, oh yeah, it is active, but they couldn't really characterize the effect until he had concentrated the Salvinorin a, it is a trip that they look like dinner plates to trip that they just grow out of the ground.

Speaker 5:          02:17:14       They look like, Hey, look at me. Did you know when mushrooms grow mean? Like there's a green field and it's green grass and this white thing just like, here I am, and it's like asking you to eat it. I mean, if there's anything that's ever asked me, it's a polite and subtle color. I'm white, I'm so bland, don't even worry. Just come home and take a bite. I mean, and the idea that, that they might have actually not even from this planet and they might've come here and asteroidal impacts. Sure. You know, that's my favorite one. That's the, my favorite sexy theory. You know, that there's another mechanic theory, right? Whereas he or he, he supported the idea that, uh, he said you would know this. He said that, um, silicide Ben. There was no other plant that was our, that had the four and the [inaudible] position or no other, no other life form fungus that had that.

Speaker 5:          02:18:11       It was the only one except for hydroxylation is unusual and there's a lot of five in the plant kingdom for the four is unusual. Is there other other ones besides. I'm not that I can think of off the top of. So his theory in mushrooms, there's sites didn't, things like that. His theory was that that had come from a, an asteroid impact that sports could survive in a vacuum when we know the building blocks of life and amino acids possibly came here from outer space. Maybe mushrooms that, that was them. They're communicating with you my plans to. Yeah. Oh yeah. He would buy the guy totally. He meaning, that's what made him write the timewave zero novelty theory. He, he, you know, they told him that he had to do it, you know, could you imagine how annoying would be every time you went on a trip, you know, you got some fucking alien mushroom people telling you, you gotta write a theory. You've got to write some biological theory. Brian, you could not look anymore board who's listening from now on foreheads and that's it. Cut you off before you went to five and you can't handle five. You think you can. Um, so we got over the stoned ape theory. What else? I want to ask you a

Speaker 6:          02:19:29       alien life, yes or no.

Speaker 4:          02:19:32       Again, I mean, all these things, there just isn't enough evidence either way. And I know that it's like a boring answer. And in some ways, but I just, you know, people will say like, it's always huge news when they find an extra solar planet that might be able to support earth like life, but so far they've never found anywhere in the known universe, a single planet that we could live on without a suit for a minute. So that's not really that encouraging. Ultimately. I like. But then when you also factor in the enormity of the universe, then of course, I think it's possible. Absolutely. I think it's possible. I just don't see at this specific moment in history any reason to think that in the part of the universe that we've observed, there's any life.

Speaker 6:          02:20:15       What do you think of the theory that life does not come here in a physical sense, but comes here through your mind in that what psychedelics are is real like gateways to communicate with other life forms and that we were hung up on the idea that something has to actually be right there to talk to you. Um, wait something. The theory, the theory is. And psychedelics opened up some sort of a gateway that allows you to communicate with aliens. That's the only aliens have. There are the aliens only exist in this is when you take a psychedelic, you can communicate with it. You can enter into some sort of a frequency that the alien is on. That's the only way they get here. They don't get here through metal ships. That's all just craziness. Uh, alien contact only comes through psychedelics.

Speaker 4:          02:21:04       It's an interesting idea

Speaker 3:          02:21:07       to what end are very dismissive. But I believe, I forget who was. Yeah, whose

Speaker 6:          02:21:15       idea that was. But there was a. God Damn it when the aliens or whatever they watch when they're in our bodies. I don't know. It might've been when Kennedy's idea as well. Yeah. He had a lot of nutty ones abroad about mushrooms. I'm pretty sure it was him, but his idea was that it was an alien life form. And then that's how you would, you would communicate with it. He didn't think it was going to come here and metal shifts. He thinks it was going to come here through the frequency that you would achieve heavy duty psychedelic state that he believes he believes he was really encountering something else. You don't believe that you don't know. You believe that it's just just the deepest facets of your imagination or is there a kashic records like do you believe in any of that? What is that?

Speaker 6:          02:21:53       The ACACIA, Acacia, Acacia, Greg Kaushik. The idea that there's knowledge and information out there and you just tune into it and that there's a record of information and like literally exists that you can just tune into and this is where creativity comes from. The other in creativity. When you teach eve the zen state of being completely in the moment, these ideas would just come to you. The idea is that these ideas are not just the firing of your synapses and the accumulation of your life experiences, but in fact you are pulling from a well of information that's out there that you can't quite recognized a regular basis and that there's. There's knowledge inherent to to the world and I think it's called the a cash occur. Acacia records is the idea behind. It's almost like taking account to there. It's almost like a crude way of explaining why we don't understand creativity.

Speaker 6:          02:22:45       While you know, we don't understand the state of mind to achieve the proper creativity is like this zen excepting sorta like when I'm in the zone. When you're writing something, you know you have great writing, I read a bunch of Shit. You, you write some really beautiful lines, but you know how sometimes they just. Sometimes you're banging them out, but sometimes they're just flowing. It's almost like they're coming out of you, like you go into this zen state and like, oh, that just came to me like, here's this thing. Some people believe that the. What you're doing is by being really creative, you're tuning in to intelligence, you're tuning into ideas and that the human body and it's managing as consciousness is really just managing a radio,

Speaker 4:          02:23:28       right? I mean, yeah, there's a lot of that. I find all those ideas kind of Hokey, well just ultimately disempowering because the de emphasize the agency that human beings have in creating, oh, we can create. Our brains are not sufficient to create, we need to tune into some kind of a record of that creates for us. Um, it's sort of a religious idea as well that, that there's like a god that gives us some kind of power. I think that's a pattern and a lot of these ideas is that they try to remove power from the individual and place it in some kind of intangible realm that we can access through being pious or through following some set of rules. But ultimately I don't want to buy into any of those ideas.

Speaker 6:          02:24:11       I, I find that I completely agree with you and that I think that a big part of it is when people do better with creative endeavors when they're humble and so it's sort of a way of not taking credit for what they're doing and just tuning into the right creative frequency. And sometimes that creative frequency, the best way to do is just give it up to like a higher power.

Speaker 4:          02:24:34       Sure. And that's not to say that it doesn't help people in the same way that religion, even if it's wrong, helps an enormous number of people.

Speaker 6:          02:24:40       Well, I've always said that it's a great operating system for a lot of people and it really does enhance their life. There's a lot of people that, for whatever reason, I don't know whether it's they're uninspired or whether they have brains that don't function at the right Rpms or whatever it is. But if you give them a some sort of an ideology, they can live a happy life. But if you left them alone in the sea of doubt and in the unknown, they could go down any path they could. They could wind up a mess. They could wind up depressed. I got mine up fucked up. They can wind up in a cult. You give them a happy religion to just live 70, happy years, die, be happy that they know they're going to go to heaven and everything's cool. It's almost like it's a, it's an effective operating system.

Speaker 6:          02:25:25       And at the end we were really not exactly sure how much of this fucking thing we're controlling with our mind. We're really not. There's a lot of doubt on that. There's a lot of doubt as to how much of life is truly random and how much of it is really created by the energy you put out your imagination, your, your actions and your deeds. What the fuck is really going on? Is it 100 percent physical or is there some. Is there some manifestation that the imagination takes part in? We don't really necessarily know. There's people that are always good. Things are constantly happening to them and they're always in great moods and they seem to perpetrate that same energy forward and you look at people like that and you wonder like how much of that is them? How much of that is they just figured out how to roll this thing and figured out how to create reality if they figured out how to just ride this thing correctly. Is it possible? Yes, it is, right? Absolutely. Yeah. You're one of the most experienced guys I think I've ever come across and as far as altered states of consciousness and you're not an old guy. How old are you? Thirty four. Twenty four. Jesus Christ son. I was going to say you're 30.

Speaker 2:          02:26:29       You're a hard 24 kids. I've seen them on the apple commercial. You were really young and that one, somebody just sent me that. That's crazy. Dude. You're way too smart to be 24. That's scary. It is. That's fascinating, man. When I was 24, I spoke in grunts for the most part. That's amazing, man. Wow. You um, you. Yeah. You, you must be the most experienced person I've ever met. Right? Many, many more experienced in this case. I actually don't know that. All this stuff he's really done. What do you take out of it, man? Do you, are you happy that you had all these experiences that changed you who you are? Absolutely. Yeah. It's good. I think just experimentation in general is important. Can everybody handle it? Probably not. Probably not, right? Probably not, but I'd be a fix that. That's a very, very complicated question.

Speaker 2:          02:27:17       So good one though, because you got a problem. Some guys are good worker. I think it requires. She was good with the landscape in business. So that fucking Hamilton Morris, cardamom acid. Sure. Yeah. No, I've had close friends that dropped out of society for whatever reason because they started to find a pointless. And it's difficult to argue with that if someone really genuinely feels that way. But um, I think there's just a, it's sort of an infantilizing gen generally disempowering idea in psychiatry and throughout society that we are not in control of ourselves. We probably see a doctor. The doctor is the expert on our mind and our body and they tell us what's wrong. They know us better than we know ourselves even after only talking to us for five minutes. And so if you go to a psychiatrist and you say, I'm having trouble working, may maybe depressed and they have adhd, what do you think I should do? I think that adderall would help me. It's immediately suspicious because you think you already know too much about what you need. They want you to go in as an infant that. So they can tell you what you need, I believe that you have, there's some emphasis or some, there's some impact at the imagination and your thinking and your energy

Speaker 6:          02:28:22       has on life. But I also believe there's a lot of random shit too. I don't think it's an either or. I think it's a combination of you interacting with all these other people that are also creating their own realities at the same time and that you can have a, you, you, you can all tune into a, a good frequency and perhaps you know, create a good community. And I think that's what people try to do it in tribes and shit like that. But at the end of the day, you're still dealing with random shit. Like the idea that you blame people for fucking diseases or for being attacked by barbarians, you know? Is that, was that in the secret, you know, the secret work back 10. Did they manifest these barbarians to come over the hills and, and, and, and chop people up. But swords back into Kona and days. No, right. You can't say it's completely. Nobody would ask for that. Nobody would create that in their own imagination for there for themselves, so it's not, it's not that you are completely in control of your destiny, but it seems like you have at least some sort of influence with energy and with your imagination and with, you know, the things that you create and the environment that you set up. I think that's one of the most important things that I've ever learned from psychedelics.

Speaker 4:          02:29:29       Absolutely. Yeah. And just being in a mindset to try new things, whatever, whether they're chemical or experiential or whatever.

Speaker 6:          02:29:38       I think cautiously try to consciously. You're, I mean obviously you didn't find out all this information about it after you've tried all these things, you knew that going in. What's the one thing that you ever did? We were like, Oh boy, here we go.

Speaker 4:          02:29:52       In what way? This might be a slippery one. Ugh, God. Slippery one. I mean, I've had a few slippery ones in my day, but uh, I think a lot of the really potent psychedelics have, have the ability to induce terror if you're too high of a dose. I've had that happen with both dmt and suicide than, um, so just so many, so many different occasions, but suddenly I've never had anything where I will actually have. Yes, I have, I've had a few kind of close to what I would consider overdose of psychedelics, where the dose is just so high that I think there might be some physical toxicity, but, but with those sorts of cases, it's very difficult to differentiate between what is motivated by fear. You know, a lot of people, even when they're sober, they'll, they'll panic or be uncomfortable and think they're having a heart attack, but it's just a panic attack or it's not even a panic attack. Um, you know, the mind is so informed by the body that especially in a psychedelic state, that it's very difficult to say, what if you're drinking IOWASCA and suddenly your heart starts beating fast. Is your heart beating fast because you're scared? Are you scared because your heart is beating fast? And which do you concentrate on the heart or the fear first in order to calm yourself down?

Speaker 6:          02:31:10       Yeah. And you might be throwing a puzzle that you can't wrestle with. It just runs you over. It's just too much. And you're just there in utter fear and until it

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       slowly leaves your system. Yeah. I overdosed when I ate that one bad shroom trip, you know, like six months ago. I mean, I couldn't walk. My legs would not work. I, they would. They were failing. Well, yeah. That's how he, he got over seven grounds. It was a lot too much. And that's just a guest that was over seven. It could be way more than that. You know, you, you're silly. You went to hearts on not, it's not unnecessary. Yeah. Did you come back? Well, what'd you come back? Fucked up. Took me a while. Like a day. A good 24 hours after two. I felt 100 percent. But didn't you learn something from the experience? Uh, yeah. My wall was like, or my bathroom was like, Tron, the original tron.

Speaker 1:          02:32:02       If you two had a conversation, I'd say, well, which one of these is 24? Which one is almost, it's almost scary. How old are you now? Thirty seven. Thirty seven, 37, he's 37 and you're 24 and see that. And he votes too. I took molly the other day and it, molly, Molly said the MTMA and it was a very, I've noticed something recently doing shrooms and it happened for some reason with molly this last time. So it makes me wonder how much of it was really Mali. But uh, I could see so much better when I'm on a psychedelic. Like, like it seems like my eyes were up because her pupils are bigger. So you probably don't have that vision. No, I mean like brighter. I mean everything's a lot brighter though. Like I can almost see in the garden tools and it makes me.

Speaker 1:          02:32:49       And I had this thing I was thinking of like it would be weird if like all the shit that you see when you're showrooming is there all the time, but your eyes adjust to the certain lightness or there's certain level of being open that you see it more when you're on shrooms. So like, like when you're seeing like you're looking at your hand, you're seeing like this crazy shit all rounded like these, like, like minds that are growing over. What if that Shit's there all the time, but you're just focusing in on that layer of a brightness or if it was more as we throw to you possible surveys, one here qualified to answer that. Uh, I would say if I had an answer for you poppy cock, it was just one of the things I thought, wow, I'm molly because I was looking like Jesus.

Speaker 1:          02:33:33       I can see in the dark right now. Let's make a bet. Let's make a bet because I say, he says it's bullshit. What do you say? Oh, it's just a theory. It's a. What if no one knows. I would probably say, well, it's your brain just shutting down. Going crazy. If I had to support your own thing. No, no. I'm just saying it's a. What if I don't? I'm not just saying. What do you think he would think? Oh, I would say is even right. I would say he would be exactly what he says on everything you know, like he's takes the safe route, which is what I do, and it's like I'm not going to fuck. He takes the scientific, the scientific route, way more angels and Unicorns. I'm looking for bigfoot, Bro. I'm always looking for bigfoot, but I know I'm looking for bigfoot. I know I really want big foot to have this, but I don't think he does. Right. But I really want them. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       Right. I mean, you don't see any. Nothing exists in the first place. None of this is colored or has any. Nothing actually looks the way we perceive it as a sensory phenomenon. And so to say what things are actually like is already problematic because it's a sensory experience. So how you. Yeah. That is fascinating, isn't it? It's almost impossible for people to really wrap their heads up that your mind puts that red in that picture. Your mind puts the dark and someone's hair, your, your, your interpretation of the world. I will, you know, and then that's the total stolen talk. Wonder Man. It's like the color blue, like what does it look like to you, man? When you see this guy, what does it look like? You do? You really don't know. We do know that it is different for some people really different. Well, I mean there's this colorblindness is like linguistic relativity and color naming. There's been a lot of scholarly research into the issue where certain primitive societies have fewer names for colors and so they'll, they'll only have black and white and that will encompass black one. Companies like red and blue and white, so it's not cross culturally defined in any way to. It must suck to get your car painted there. Can you car painted in the jungle? Like I asked for blue. This is red. You fuck that. Like same shit.

Speaker 2:          02:35:37       The end of the podcast. We just all lost. Complete total news. Yeah. Asm. I don't even know how we got onto the subject of the color. Where did that come from? He was saying that he saw vines crawling all over the interpretation of things around us. I love molly though and I think it's one in this beautiful drugs ever. Is it illegal? Totally illegal by Joe. Have you? Have you done it? No, I've only done Mtma and I only did it work.

Speaker 1:          02:36:02       You take your wife to Hawaii, you sit on the beach and you do two each and you just sit there and you will fucking have the most beautiful time in the whole entire road and you're going to have a reset. You're going to be so you and your wife are going to connect in a way that you've never had since you've started dating. And it's, it's, it's, it's gonna be amazing. Well, it's, I highly recommend it more than anything. Why? I love it. It's like a little love bug. Get Molly. You will have the time of your life. How much maurice,

Speaker 2:          02:36:33       you're a a young fellow. Um, how do you find a mate that can deal with any of this? Talking in conversation? How do you, how you at 24 years old guy or girl, I don't know if you're gay or straight, but how do you find anybody to hang out with that? You would, you know that you're ready?

Speaker 1:          02:36:51       Start off looking in trees or chicks? Well,

Speaker 2:          02:36:54       I'll tell you right now, it's gonna be a tough conversation at dinner. Well, many people that are interested in the scientific element of a few close friends who are scientists who I talk with about this kind of stuff. So when you date, how do you, you know, what did you do at work today? And you started talking about feminine allylamines and all these different crazy shit. Do you have girls? Do their eyes glaze over or do they,

Speaker 2:          02:37:20       did they look to you for God? I mean it depends on what their academic background is, but yeah, I would say most people are not interested in that sort of thing unless you. I'm trying to phrase this as high as possible without actually saying it, but you must get mad amounts of stoner pussy thrown at you. At least. Come on man. You're like a. you're an online stoner hero type. Do they must just chicks boss launched at you? You don't use the twitter enough. I don't. Maybe today's the day that I started Hamilton Morris one when that letter. One name no space. Yeah, he's got one tweet. But if you're going to have one tweet, this is the fucking tweet to have. What was. What was your tweet? You have one amazing tweet. What is your one tweet? Do you remember? None at the top of my head. It's a pastor

Speaker 9:          02:38:08       second. Trying to find it now,

Speaker 2:          02:38:12       right? I want you to talk one profile. Please vote for me on the shorter shorty where it's got a desk dot TV and at the top of it click on phone for me and I'm getting beat by a wwe wrestler that has half a million hits. I won't win, but it just makes me feel happy that I'm in second place. At least Hamilton. Mars only has one tweet and this is it. In the realm of scientific observation, luck is granted only to those who are prepared.

Speaker 2:          02:38:37       That's romantic. You can have one quote by the way. I think that quotes kind of hacky. There's A. There's a couple of versions that are out there. You know, somebody, somebody fucking gangsters, quote. Luck is only granted those prepared. You know, success is when luck meets preparation. It's like an old. That's the oldest quotation ever. They just, Dr that shit up. It made it fancy. They made it sound a little profound. Little more profound, but really basically they dug, they dot an old saying a Fox, but if you're going to have one quote, that's it dude. And I like, I didn't even use quote marks or didn't use it. Period though. You used the period maybe should be attributed to someone, but it's easy enough. Yeah, they should figure it out. Right? You didn't write that yourself. Did you fade away like Def Leppard? I don't know.

Speaker 2:          02:39:24       Did he say that? Hamilton Morris. This has been our worst podcast we've ever had, but it's only because of us. Really. You were amazing. Every time we called upon you, your questions were great. We just got Brian a little two. It's two stones and it threw us off a little. But uh, it was fascinating, man. You, uh, you don't have to turn the music. Let him pump up his shit right now. It's going to put. Um, so if, if people want to watch any of your stuff, um, it's Hamilton's Pharmacopia. That's right. Yeah. That's what it is. And Vice magazine and then vice magazine. Copia on VBS. Was there any one site that's the best place to access all your stuff? A vice is the main place. I usually post new things on my blog. Also Harper's magazine, so they should google it. Right. But not today because Google's down bitches is. Wikipedia is down

Speaker 5:          02:40:14       the protesting Sopa they're trying to take it folks. They know. They know the end is near for them. They know you're good for hillbrow people for big corporations like Google and that in a wikipedia for standing up for this shit. Well, I heard it's dead. I heard the bill is dead as it stands, but they're going to try to rework it. I don't know. It's terrifying. This is. It must terrify you mean you. You're on the Internet constantly and you're doing illegal shit. Yeah, I mean it could have some employee. The idea that they can just come in and take down your site at their discretion, and this was right after the Nda, a a national defense authorization act passed, which is another terrifying thing to. Could just arrest you. They don't have to have a warrant. Just we were wearing weird times, man. They're coming after your dual cassette recorders guys.

Ladies and gentlemen, it's a weird subject. It's much like psychedelics. It's really underappreciated. It's physical maintenance, I think. I think it's good. The body needs to be able to breathe as often as possible. And uh, that's too distracting. You don't want to involve all these different people in your life and have sex with them. Get yourself a flashlight. Kids. It's not that expensive. They last a long time. As long as you don't do what Brian does them and fixed them, turn them inside out shows going on anyway.
