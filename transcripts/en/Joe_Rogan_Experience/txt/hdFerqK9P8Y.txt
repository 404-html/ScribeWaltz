Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello

Speaker 2:          00:02          bitches, man, it, it, it, it,

Speaker 1:          00:05          you still have those yellow jerseys in your house and you have to give them back into. No good. Fuck them. She put an instagram picture of them every day.

Speaker 2:          00:12          That was. Yeah, that. Yeah, I'm not going to put that picture up again.

Speaker 1:          00:18          That was a great picture though. Oh, you chilling on the couch at seven Yellow Jersey.

Speaker 2:          00:22          He's on your wall. I got, I got a note for that one. Well, you're going to get nuked no matter what you do. Look. But, but I, I look, I mean they're up. They're up and uh, and, and I'm proud of him. I really am. And I'm proud of. And that's the thing too, is that as weird as it is, and as strange as it is, that there's just a line through those years as if they did not happen. Man, I, I had, I was paid to do a job, right. As messy as the job was, whatever I was paid to do it. And I did it. Uh, and I wanted to win. I wanted to capture those memories for myself and for my teammates. And you can't, nobody can take those away from me. I still hold those memories it to myself. And um, yeah, it's, it's, it's had a complicated ending. But, um, you know, I still view those as victories and I still view those memories as good

Speaker 1:          01:12          carrying around the lie and being interrogated and questioned. And it was that the hardest part about all of it.

Speaker 2:          01:21          You know, I was, I was only interrogated there are questioned with the press and, and even, um, you know, God, if it would have been in this day and age with, with, with twitter and facebook and social media and it would've, it would've been a thousand times worse. I mean, this was, you know, I mean, this was in the late nineties. I mean, think about that. That was a long time ago. And so the level of scrutiny while it was high wasn't nearly as high as it would have been today. Um, but yeah, I mean, once you dig in, you know, with these, with these guys, you're, you're stuck. So

Speaker 1:          01:58          once you finally came clean, I mean, obviously there was a lot of blowback, but was there also a relief?

Speaker 2:          02:05          Um, not, not immediately. Not immediately. I mean, I, I, uh, I get asked that a lot and I think people, um, people, people expect me to say, well, you know, it was just this, it was just this huge relief off your shoulders when you, when you talk to oprah or, or whatever you did, that, that you can now move forward and live the life of an honest man and et Cetera, et cetera. But it's taken me. Let me just sum it up. I mean, sitting here today, having this conversation, I would much prefer to have this conversation than the one where I would have lied to your fucking face 15 times, 10 years ago. I'd much rather talk like this. So that's, that's a relief. Um, but, but, you know, it's not like I walked out of sitting with Oprah and was like, oh my God, I feel amazing.

Speaker 2:          02:54          That was, that wasn't asked weapon. And uh, so was it like there with Oprah? She's asking, she's drilling you, asking you questions about that start. She came out, she came out hot, yes or no, yes or no, yes or no other. She did a good job. She did a great job. I thought she did a good job. I thought it was very compelling. Yep. Because the way she structured the beginning part of the conversation. Yeah. Especially if you're going to do something like that on television. You want to capture people and keep them there. You kind of have to approach it that way. I thought she did a good job. I don't know that it wasn't well received and I. and in what way? You mean people didn't like you afterwards in that way? I think there's two things. Number one, I, I wasn't emotionally ready to do that interview.

Speaker 2:          03:42          I wasn't, uh, I wasn't in a place where I think that I sit today where it's, it, it's, it is a position of contrition and understanding the tremendous sense of betrayal that's out there. Like my perception of that today is much sharper than it was three years ago when I sat with her, the feds and other lawsuits forced my hand. I had to sit there with that because I knew I was going to be sitting with her or with you or with Tom Brokaw or I was going to be sitting with a government lawyer being deposed, being videoed and being leaked. So I said, well, I'm going to go. I'm going to find the place that I'd rather sit down and talk about this as opposed to a grainy video that the government leaks to the world and that's your coming out party. So I did that.

Speaker 2:          04:29          But the thing about Oprah is, is aside from me just not being ready at the time to do it, you know, people sensed that, but most importantly for the diehard cycling fans and sports fans, I didn't say enough. You didn't name names, you didn't. You didn't call anybody out. It wasn't detailed enough. You're holding back. You're protecting people. That's what they said. That's a very small percentage of the population for the majority of the population. Those first five minutes was way too much information. They were like, what the fuck did I just hear? Like blood bags, Hipo, testosterone transfusions, cheating. It was way too much. So you had people that were at one camp, a smaller camp said he didn't say anything. He's holding back here. The other campus, like that's, that's more than I needed to hear. And so everybody was pissed. Well, I don't know why they would think it's too much.

Speaker 2:          05:25          I mean, I don't know. I don't understand that logic because it is reality or a grandma in Duluth. Right. And, and you and you support it. The cancer survivor clause isn't real and you hear that. I mean, you're sitting there going, uh, I don't, I don't like anything about this. So the, uh, so I see because they were also supporting lives drawn. Also supporting, but the story, how much of an effect did it have like almost immediately on your foundation or a donor? Because I was asked to leave the before that. And so now I haven't been back. So I, I don't know and I'm not, and I don't ask, is it still around? Yeah, yeah, but it must have taken a devastating, I think so. I mean it takes a hit in terms of obviously in terms of fundraising, which directly leads to its, you know, its effectiveness in terms of helping create change for cancer survivors were all around the world. You need to raise money in order to do that. Um, staff layoffs. Uh, I mean, you name it. I mean it's a but, but I don't, I don't have specifics because once I left the board and left the organization and they legally changed the name, I mean, I don't know.
