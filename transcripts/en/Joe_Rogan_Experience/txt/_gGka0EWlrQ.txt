That's not real. Yeah, no it's not. Come on. That's not real. That guy's face faces. Photoshop. You're so full of shit. Look at that guy in the left. The lighting, the lighting is totally, it's not real. They're, they have their shadows are in the wrong direction. Hugh Jackman Shadow's coming towards us. This guy's shadow is going towards his left shoulder on real. Get the fuck out of here. How dare you think that Dude's hgh in? Uh, probably. Yeah, if he's smart. Shred it out, Bro.

He's telling them how I'm watching that movie made them cure cancer. That's what it is.

Speaker 1:          01:24          So Hugh Jackman's guy in the right, let me see, is he really holding that guy's hand or is that a perspective that night? Like a perspective thing. Who cares if he's gay? But it's a weird thing like a chicken. Be Gay like a Jodie foster and everyone knows she's gay. She's out, it's all good. And she could play okay. That is super gay. God, but sexy Frawley he looks so these look so big. But you know, if a woman like Jodie foster be decides to come out and you know, proclaims that she's gay, that's not real either. Stop it. Just stop. Stop. Now. It's a woo hoo. Awesome opinions. What's this guy doing? It's fucking my kg. I didn't plan this. Um, tell you a funny story and some of your listeners know I had the first Jujitsu Academy and the eastern seaboard and these guys and a exercise.

Speaker 1:          02:17          And um, at one point we had a guy by the name of Jeff, Tom Watson, who was a Philadelphia Eagle football player. This guy was probably about six foot five to 75 at the time, if I remember correctly. Unbelievably strong and lean and slim. He was the darling of the super bowl the year that the eagles went to the superbowl in Jacksonville. He was called up. He had actually been released from the team, but they had a couple of injuries and they called him in and went in there, caught a couple of touchdown passes. Wow. So, uh, he, he's, he comes to my Jujitsu class and it's like, Whoa, wait a minute. [inaudible] was designed to protect us for guys like you, man. You know, what do you do with a guy? I mean just ungodly strong. Yeah. He came to my kettlebell class. It's the first time I ever had to break out like a 48 kilogram kettlebell just to teach these guys swings cause he was based kilogram.

Speaker 1:          03:07          What is that about a hundred pounds? That's a hundred. I mean he was just like doing front uprisings, w you know, front front raises with his shoulders. He was just so ridiculously strong. So he gets a go on with one of my brown butter, the time a fellow by the name of Ron Hawkins who lives in Hawaii. He teaches in the why now. But at that time Ronnie was a brown belt and ron gets him of course, you know, and then our block right from the mouth and the guy literally does a Turkish get up with Ronnie, the fcm op. How much does Ronnie way? Probably about 148 pounds at the time. Under 50 and the, you know, this guy's like two seven fa. He literally does a Turkey. Turkey's got up and just putting rhymes head through the ceiling. I remember screaming cause I, you know, this guy was like really an important part of our team.

Speaker 1:          03:48          Don't hurt. Don't break Friday. Don't break rati put him down. Put him down. It was insane. It's just insane. Just how strong some people can be. I mean, you mean once you came to America and what I was trying to get at was like, what is it? What's the opinion of America when you're living over in England? Does it look like when you see people were invading Afghanistan, fucking blowing up Iraq and some missiles into Pakistan from robots that fly in the sky or sucking up all the oil all over the world. Didn't bug us at all. You're fucking awesome neighbors. No, I didn't know the craziest fucking phrase. A really fucking pissed us off guys. Serious is when you come into our pubs that your shitty rain jackets. You know who is this weekend? What the Fuck Matt Farah? We didn't do nothing. I don't own a single north face.
