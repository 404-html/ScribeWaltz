Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Three, two, one. Boom. Hello, Jack. What's up? Nice to meet you, man. Nice to meet you finally. Yeah. Keep this soccer like a fist from your face. Oh, that's good. First of all, Dude, you started a company when you started twitter. When you guys first started. Did you have any idea? There's no way you could've added any idea what it would be now? No, but one of the things I always try to emphasize with people when the people are like, oh, twitter's crazy. Like how could it not be crazy? There's never been anything like it before. Like imagine trying to predict the kind of, the president of United States uses twitter to threaten other countries. Yeah, I mean fuck. Saw that coming. Nobody saw that coming. You think it was going to be when you first did it?

Speaker 2:          00:00:51       Well, you know, we were building this thing for ourselves and that's how that, that's how everything starts. We wanted to use it. We wanted to, we wanted to, you know, stay connected with each other. We group text like a group text. We loved our phones. We loved, um, technology. We actually started this as a hack week project out of a failed company called Odeo. Just podcasting. I remember that super early on. We were, uh, were really creative folks, but we weren't that passionate about where podcasting was going in our particular domain. We just got a lot of competition early on Itunes, just released their podcast directory. But we knew we wanted to work together. We knew we love this idea of one button publishing. We love this idea of collaboration. We love this idea of a being anywhere and being able to share what was happening.

Speaker 2:          00:01:49       That was, that was the idea. I mean that, that was it. And that's what we wanted it to be. And I think the most beautiful and also sometimes uncomfortable aspect of twitter is it, um, we really learned what it wanted to be and the people helped create it. Like everything that we hold sacred now, the at symbol, the Hashtag, the retweet, those were not invented by me or the company. Those were things that we discovered, things that we discovered people using and we just observed it and we, we noticed what they were trying to do. They're trying to talk with one another. They were trying to, um, collect tweets around topics with a Hashtag.

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       Has anybody figured out when the first use of Hashtag something was created?

Speaker 2:          00:02:39       Yeah, it was, um, it was actually our lead designer, uh, Robert Anderson who leads our design of the cash app. I'm hired him for square uh, later on, but uh, he was the first one. He was actually communicating with his brother and uh, he put at buzz, his brother's is buzz and it just kinda spread. It wasn't in mass but people were doing it, but what was most interesting is not what they're doing, but what they wanted to do with it. They wanted to address each other and that's, that changed the company completely. That changes the service because I went from just broadcasting what's happening to conversation and to being, being able to address anyone publicly out in the open, which came with it a lot of power and also a lot of issues as well.

Speaker 1:          00:03:32       Yeah. The, the use of Hashtags, like a little looking up Hashtag, you know, fry fest or Hashtag, you know, anytime there's something weird that's in the news that's a, that's such a unique way to find things, but to go on twitter and to, to utilize that. It's uh, it's, it's interesting that you're, that this guy just did it just to contact his brother.

Speaker 2:          00:03:55       Well that was, that was the symbol of the Hashtag was this Guy Christmas ina and he was trying to, he was trying to tag, um, Houston trying to tag around topics that he was tweeting about. And again, that spread, all we did was made it easier. We made it more accessible. We enabled everyone to do it. Uh, without symbol. We made a page that collected all mentions of your name with the Hashtag. We allowed people to search a immediately so you can tap on the keyword. And you would see everyone talking about that or tweeting about that specific Hashtag. So these things were just emergent behaviors that we didn't predict and they became the lifeblood of the service.

Speaker 1:          00:04:33       What's fascinating to me about something like twitter or even something like youtube is that there's not a lot of other ones like it. There's just this one thing, like how does that happen where this one thing sort of gets adopted by everybody and takes over and then just becomes this overwhelmingly massive platform. I mean, there's really, there's Vimeo and there's a few other video services, but nothing on the scale of youtube. And that's the same thing with twitter. There's nothing on the scale of distributing information in a quick, short, 280 character form like that.

Speaker 2:          00:05:06       We, um, I, I don't think we could plan for it. I don't think we could necessarily billed for that. I, uh, someone said recently to, uh, we just, you know, gathered a bunch of our leadership last week in palm springs for an offsite. And someone said recently the twitter was discovered. And I think what's behind all that is that it, it, it hits something foundational, it hit something essential. And my co founder Biz likes to say that twitter can never be uninvented. It's here. It changed everything though. The use of it has been revolutionary and it's just this simple idea of, you know, if you could text with the entire world, if you could actually reach anyone in the world or anyone could see what you're thinking, which I think is also the beautiful thing about, about taxed and the, and the medium. You can actually get it, someone's raw thoughts and anyone in the world can see that instantaneously. It becomes a subconscious. It becomes this global consciousness. And it, uh, it gets to some really deep places in society. And, and some of those places are pretty uncommon.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       Well, it also gets to some really deep places psychologically. Um, there's, there's some, there's a weirdness to it, right? There's a weirdness to sending text, particularly at anonymously, you know, um, and there's so many accounts that are just an egg, you know, so many accounts where they're clearly designed, if you like. Sometimes someone will tweet something mean to me and I'm like, hmm, I wonder what this person's up to. So I go to their site and it's just them tweeting mean shit at people all day long. Like it's probably some angry person at work and then like, I'm just going to find people and fuck with them all day. When did you realize, or when did you realize, I'm sure you're aware of it, and when did you realize that this was almost out of your control in terms of the scale of it?

Speaker 2:          00:07:06       Uh, there were, there, there wasn't, there wasn't one moment, there wasn't one moment that it just felt completely resonant. It's just, it's, it's unfolded into the next thing and the next use case. And it just keeps surprising us with how people are using it. We, you know, it, it definitely. Um, recently I think we've identified some of the areas of the service that we need to pay a lot more attention to. Twitter is unique in that it has two main spaces, one which is your timeline and those are the people that you follow and uh, you know, when you follow someone, they've earned that audience and then it has this other world where anyone can insert themselves into the conversation they can actually mention you and you'll see that without asking for it, you can insert yourself into hashtags, into a search. Um, and these are areas that people have taken advantage of and these are the areas that people have gained our systems to in some cases artificially amplify, but also just to spread a lot of things that weren't possible with the velocity of that they're not possible before.

Speaker 1:          00:08:28       Now when this is all happening, what's the conversation like at twitter when you recognizing that this is happening, that people are kind of gaming the system? Like what it, how do you guys, how do you mitigate it? What's the discussion?

Speaker 2:          00:08:42       Well, early on it was, um, it was pretty surface level. Like, how do we change some of the APP dynamics, but more recently we're trying to go a lot deeper and asking ourselves the question when people open twitter, what are we incentivizing, what are we telling them to do when they open up this app? We may not explicitly be doing it, but there's something that we're saying without, um, being as clear about it. So what does the light button incentivize? What does the retweet, incentivize? What does the number of followers and making that number big and bold incentivize? So I'm not sure what we should. I'm not sure if we should incentivize anything, but we need to understand what that is. And I think, you know, right now we, we do incentivize a lot of echo chambers because we don't make it easy for people to follow interests and topics.

Speaker 2:          00:09:44       It's only accounts we incentivize, um, a lot of outrage and how hot takes, um, because of the, some of the dynamics in the service. Not allowing a lot of nuance in conversation earlier on, um, uh, pseudonyms, uh, this, uh, this, uh, ability to not use your real name incentivizes some positive things like allows for whistleblowers and journalists who, uh, might fear for their career or even worse their life and under certain regimes, but also allows for people like the example you mentioned of just random fire and a spread of abuse and harassment throughout. So those are the things that we're looking at and how do we, how do we enable more of the conversation to evolve? How do we increase the credibility, reputation of accounts? Um, how do we identify a credible voices within a particular domain? I'm not just through this very coarse grain, blue verified badge, but if you're an expert in a particular topic, how do we recognize that in real time and show that so that we can provide more context to who you're talking to and if you want to engage in a deeper conversation or just ignore mute or block them.

Speaker 1:          00:11:07       But what is the conversation like while you were at work? Like when you realized that all this stuff is happening. Um, and you realizing that now, particularly because the president uses it so often in such a, I mean, it's his preferred platform for communicating with the people. I mean even more so than addresses. It's really, it's very strange. What's the conversation like in the office when you're trying to figure out, hey, what's our responsibility here? Like how are we supposed to handle this or how do we. I mean, you're, you're, in some ways what twitter is doing is it's really kind of its flavoring, the public narrative, its flavoring, the way we communicate with each other in this, in our culture worldwide.

Speaker 2:          00:11:51       Yeah, I mean, the conversation has definitely evolved. I think in the past we just got super reactive. Um, we were reacting to all the negative things that we're seeing in that led to a lot of short term thinking. Um, more recently we've just looked much deeper. We don't react to the, to the present day where we look for some of the patterns and um, you know, we, we have, uh, we have a company that, uh, is not just serving the people of this particular country, the United States. This is global, we have global leaders all around the use all around the world using us in, in different ways. Some, you know, more, um, with higher velocity, some, uh, recognize more of the power. Um, some put out statements, some lead conversations, but it's looking at all those dynamics and not trying to hyperfocus on any one particular one because if we do, we're only building it for one portion of the population are only one perceived a present, a crisis.

Speaker 1:          00:12:57       What I'm, what I'm trying to get at was like, okay, look, when things come up, like say if you find out that there's people from Isis, the using twitter and they using twitter and posting things like what is the conversation like, how do, what do we do about this? Do we let them leave this up? We, we recognize this as free speech. Do we only take it down if they're calling for murder or hate speech? Like what, how do you handle that?

Speaker 2:          00:13:23       Well, it evolves. I mean because like we first saw isis when the world saw isis and we needed to change our policy to deal with it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       What was the, what was the initial reaction to it? So once you realized that people from Isis, we're making twitter accounts and they were trying to recruit people and doing all these things, what was the, what was the thought process? Oh, it was a question like what are, what are we going to do about this? We haven't experienced this before. We need to. Nobody has. I mean, you're essentially pioneered.

Speaker 2:          00:13:48       No. Yeah, but there, there are people who have experienced in different forms in different mediums. So we reach out to our government partners, for instance, our law enforcement partners, we reach out to our peer companies to ask if they're seeing the same things that we're seeing. Um, we have a bunch of civil societies that we talked to, uh, to get their take on it as well. And we try to balance that across, um, you know, various spectrums, whether it be a, you know, a more organizations that are more focused on preventing online harassment all the way to the Acu and the eff who are protecting the first amendment online. So we, we try to get as many perspectives as possible. Take that and then make some informed decisions, but also realize that we're probably gonna make some mistakes along the way and all we can do to correct some of that is just be open about where we are and that's probably where we failed the most in the past is we just haven't been open about our thinking process.

Speaker 2:          00:14:50       Um, what led particular decisions, how our terms of service evolve in terms of service as an area in our industry is just a, it's a mess. No one reads them, you, you know, you sign up for these services and you quickly hit accept and we expect people to read these rules of the road, but they haven't read them. And have you ever read them? I have read. Have you read facebook's? I haven't read facebook. I'm not on facebook. I'm not on facebook. Facebook, right. Just kidding. What about instagram? Do you ever read theirs? I was, uh, I was in the first 10 users of a, of instagram. Really? Uh, Kevin was a intern. Kevin Systrom was an internet at Odeo and um, I was one of the first investors of instagram and loved the service side. Don't think I've ever read their terms of service. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

Speaker 2:          00:15:48       Even you. Even me, but I read ours and one of the things I noticed right away is, you know, you read are uh, you read our terms of service and one of the first things that we put at the top of the page was copyright and intellectual property protections. You go down, you scroll down, you see everything about violent threats and abuse and harassment and a safety and it's not that the company intended for that to be the order, it just, we just added things going on. But even a read of that put forth our point of view like we're, we're, we're actually putting copyright infringement above the safety, the physical safety of someone. So we need to relook at some of these things and how they've evolved and how they reacted.

Speaker 1:          00:16:38       But is it above just because it's listed in second? I mean is they're essentially all in the same one sheet there on the one sheet when you. When you bring it up, when you discuss it first. Is that really critical? They're all. They're all part of the terms of service. Yeah, but I think that ordering matters, like what, what do we consider to be most important and we have to consider physical safety to the to be the one thing that we protect the most and so I to go threats, physical threats, doxing, doxing, anything that impinges on someone's physical safety.

Speaker 2:          00:17:11       An area where I don't think a technology and services like ours have a focused on enough. We haven't focused on the f off platform ramifications of what happens online.

Speaker 1:          00:17:22       So what do you do? Like like here's a good, for instance, this situation with this, a young kid who had the Maggot hat on and the native American gentleman who was in front of him banging the drum and then people are calling for this kid's name. They want his name. They want us to address, including Kathy Griffin. Like how do you. How do you handle something like that? Well, because that's essentially request for doxing.

Speaker 2:          00:17:45       Yeah. And that's, that is a new vector that we haven't seen in mass and this, these are, these are the cases that bring up entirely new thing, so we have to study it. We have to see how we reacted, what happened with a network. Um, but this goes back to the incentives, like we are incentivizing this very quick reaction and it's taking away from some of them, some more of the like considered work that we need to do to really diagnose what's happening in the moment. And it was such an interesting case study to see how that evolved over just 48 hours.

Speaker 1:          00:18:23       Yes. And that's one of the most fascinating new cycles or stories in the new cycle and quantitative because it's nuanced. There's, there's many different levels to it. Yeah. And a lot of like really knee jerk reactions.

Speaker 2:          00:18:36       Totally. And, but we helped that had to help it. Well, it, it's just, that's how some of the dynamics of the service work, but those are those things we can

Speaker 1:          00:18:46       to make sure the service or is it the way people choose to use the service? Like if you're a thoughtful person, you wouldn't just like for instance, the original image that was distributed, uh, came from an account that's now banned, right? And so it was, it was discovered that that account was a troll account. What, how does that happen and what was the thought process behind that? Because the image that they posted was a legitimate image. It really did happen. It wasn't, it was a part of an actual occurring event. So why did you ban the person or the troll account that put it up?

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       I don't know about this particular case, but it's likely that it was found. There's, there's a lot of what you see on the surface, the twitter and some of the actions that we take on the surface. But where we spend a lot of our enforcement is actually what's happening underneath. So in many cases we have um, trolls or people like the case that you mentioned whose sole purpose is just to harass or abuse or spread a particular information and oftentimes sees accounts might be connected or they start one account that gets banned, they start another account, but we can actually see this through a network Lens and we can actually see some of those behaviors. So that might have been one of the reasons I'm not sure in, in, in that particular case, but you know, at the, how do you know,

Speaker 1:          00:20:17       do you know because of Ip addresses, do you know because of the,

Speaker 2:          00:20:20       a variety of things. So it could be, it could be trying to use the same phone number or St Mil address Ip addresses, um, device ids, all these things that we can use to, to judge what's happening within the context. So we do have a lot of occurrences of suspending or temporarily suspending accounts because of activities across accounts. Um, and, and that, that happens a ton. But what I mean, what I mean in, in that we're helping this right now is like some of the incentives, like just just imagine seeing that unfold and when you see someone with one take, it kind of emboldened something to follow along and then this mob kind of rules. So there has to be a way for us to incentivize a, a lot more, more considered and more nuanced introspection of what's going on.

Speaker 1:          00:21:11       Yeah. Give everybody mushrooms. Probably the only way to know how are you going to get people to be more considerate. I mean, what your engineering social behavior, right?

Speaker 2:          00:21:21       Yup. Provided more context, context, context. Like as an example, let's say brexit for example. Okay. So, um, if I followed a bunch of accounts that like, like Boris Johnson, who was constantly giving me information about reasons to leave, I would probably only see that perspective. Nigel Farrage. Yeah. And those. And those, a lot of folks just will not follow accounts that have a completely different perspective or a different influence. A number of people do. Hopefully journalists do, but most people won't do that work. So this is the only tool we give people follow an account if, however, during that time you followed the Hashtag, you follow the Hashtag vote leave 95 percent of the conversation and the tweets you see are all reasons to leave, but there's a small percentage that shows a different perspective and that shows a different, um, a different reasoning. We don't make it easy for anyone to do that and that is for anyone to follow the bit of perspective, follow the Hashtag follow topic, follow, follow an interest.

Speaker 2:          00:22:33       And because of that we help build an echo chamber and something that doesn't really challenge any perspective and not to say that we should force that upon people, but we don't even make it easy for people to do. In the first place though, the way you do that today, as you go to the explore tab, you look, you search for a Hashtag or you tap into a Hashtag and you can see all the conversation. But that's, that's work. And most people just won't do the work. They'll stay in their timeline, they'll see what they need to see. And I can certainly imagine, you know why if I'm just following a bunch of people who have the exact same take on this, it just continues to embolden in Bolton bolden and they see nothing of a different perspective on the exact same, the exact same situation.

Speaker 1:          00:23:21       What's interesting to me is the difference between twitter and instagram. Essentially. It's not just the photographs. What's weird that has happened was there's shitty people on instagram as well. I mean there's. There's a lot of arguments and things along those lines, but they don't overwhelm the, the initial post. Whereas with twitter on a different surface. Yeah, it's. Instagram is a is a post. I mean it's a post. It's not really eliciting conversation and soliciting comments. It's difficult to follow the conversations. I don't think there was a conversation. It sometimes there is some, some. Sometimes people are going back and forth about a particular subject that's discussed in the initial post, but it's not. It's not very clear. Whereas with with twitter, it only conference, it's only conversation, but even if there's a photograph, even if somebody posted a photograph on twitter and has conversation under it, the photograph seems to be like of secondary importance.

Speaker 2:          00:24:18       Super Fluid and super messy too. But yeah, the thing is every on instagram or any any blog, you have this, this post the statement and you have comments underneath. Whereas with twitter, everything is on the same surface. It's all one surface.

Speaker 1:          00:24:36       Yeah. My friend Kurt Metzger likes that about facebook. He says, because in twitter egos I post something and then all these fucking morons post something and he goes, you know Kurt, he's very animated. He's like in their shit looks like just like my shit. It's all together. I'll pile up. He goes, but if I post something on facebook, he goes, I have this whole thing like this is the statement. And then underneath it, yeah, you fucking say whatever you want, but no one's no one's reading that. They're reading the original initial post and it's clear that there's a differentiation between the initial post and the secondary post.

Speaker 2:          00:25:11       Yeah, I, I, you know, there's room for both models, but I, this conversation, most conversations, it's not you making a statement and me just reacting to that, like the, our conversation evolves based on what we say. We can interrupt one another, we can, you know, we can completely change the subject. I can take control of the conversation and the people who might find that interesting follow it and the folks that don't just stop listening, whereas you can't do that in a post comment model.

Speaker 1:          00:25:44       Yeah. It's also text is so limited there. It's, I mean, it's great for just getting out actual facts, but it's so thinking.

Speaker 2:          00:25:53       It's just so close to thinking like if there's no composition, right. You know, and, and that's uh, that to me is the most beautiful thing about twitter, but also something that can be uncomfortable. Like I, I can compose my life on Instagram, I can compose my thoughts within a facebook post and it can look so perfect. But the best of twitter is just super raw and it's right, it's right to the thinking process. And I just think that's so beautiful because it gets to, it gets to consciousness, it gets to something deeper. And I think that deeper. How so? How is it different than a post on instagram or post on facebook? The speed demands, you know, the character constraint, the speed of just demand to a more conscious present focused thinking versus stepping back and composing a letter. Yeah. And composing a letter and thinking about all the outcomes.

Speaker 2:          00:26:51       But oftentimes people do compose it as a letter and they break it up into separate 280 character posts. Yeah. The blue was the thought process in going from 1:40 to 80 because the one thing that I liked about 1:40 is that you can't be verbose. Yeah. You can't just, just ramble and, you know, like, it's great for comics because he forces us to write jokes like with economy of words. Exactly. We, uh, we found a lot of resonance with what journalists because the headlines we've found a lot of resonance with, with comics because of the rhythm. And we found a lot of resonance with hip hop as well because of the bars. And just the structure and the constraint allowed that, that flow. Um, the, the thinking was we looked at um, our, you know, languages around the world and, and uh, there's some languages like German, 140 characters.

Speaker 2:          00:27:42       You can't really say much, can't really say much at all because words are so long. There are some languages, like Japanese 140 characters is 140 words. And what was interesting about Japan was Japan is one of our largest, our largest countries were bigger than facebook. There were a lot bigger than facebook and America know what the fuck. I don't even use facebook, sorry. Facebook. I don't either. I mean I use it in terms of if I post something on instagram it goes to facebook, but when I go to facebook it's, it just seems like a lot. But this seems like twitter to a lot of arguing. But what twitter seems to be more fun, if that makes any sense. Even though it's, there's a lot of chaos when something. One of my favorite things is when someone post something stupid and then underneath it is a bunch of Jeff's say gifs or jifs.

Speaker 2:          00:28:33       I say Gif. Does anybody know him? Gifts? I say gifts. That's the jury's out. A bunch of gifts that are hilarious now. Like was just mocking someone relentlessly. Like that is one of my favorite things about twitter. I when someone like Donald trump posts something ridiculous and then I'll go and I'll look at the responses like how do you care if it's a public conversation and you can see our own racks, but like it's all. The interesting thing about twitter is there's. There's not one twitter. It's like you have politics. Twitter which can be super toxic. You have sports, twitter, you have NBA, twitter, you have mma, twitter, you have a UFC, twitter, you have k-pop, twitter, you have a black twitter, black twitter has jamie's you. He loves black. All these different twitters and you and you have a. You have a completely different experience based on what twitter you follow in order to participate in.

Speaker 2:          00:29:27       Some of them were are like super engaging, super funny. Some of them are, um, you want to walk away from it? Yeah. I got to a certain point where I couldn't read replies anymore. I just, it's just not as, not that it's that toxic. The vast majority of interactions I have with people are super positive. That may mean absolutely like more than 99 percent, but it's, um, I didn't, I don't have time and I don't have time to be constantly responding to people and it just didn't. The sheer numbers. I think when I got around 3 million ish followers, I'm like, I can't do this anymore. It's just, it's just, it's overwhelming. Like I don't have the resources. I'm a huge believer in serendipity. So you, you, you look at your replies once and you might see something that just strikes you and that's enough. You don't need to read through all of them.

Speaker 2:          00:30:15       Yeah. And sometimes you might miss something groovy. You might. But I also believe that the most important thing is to come back up. What I used to do a lot without go through my mentions and when people would essentially use it as almost a news aggregator. I go through my mentions that people would post cool stories and then I would retweet those and so because people knew that I would retweet them, they would send me a lot of cool stuff. So because of that, because of reciprocating a got a lot of really cool stuff sent my way, you're pushing, you're pushing more out and expand the network and I reinforced it. I just wanted to thank people for posting cool stuff and they love the fact they would get a retweet and so they would send me like interesting science stories are very bizarre nature stories and I just retweet them all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:30:59       Go to. But then after awhile I'm like mmm, this is a lot of time. So a lot of times. So now essentially what I do is I just post something and I just kinda like, I just walk away. But that, I mean that speaks of what we want to incentivize more. We want more people contributing things that back to the network. Back to the back to the public conversation, and I, I know it doesn't feel like this today for most people, but my ideal is someone walks away from twitter learning something and they're actually learning something entirely new. That might be a new perspective. That happens a lot. It probably happens more often than we follow. Exactly it. It's all dependent on the, on the twitter. You follow her and like the, you know, the health. Twitter is amazing. Uh, you know, I learned some, I like, I followed a Rhonda Patrick and I'm sure in the sauna and I'm Wim Hoff and ice pass and uh, uh, Ben Greenfield and you just follow them and you just get all this new information about alternative views of how to stay healthy, how to live longer.

Speaker 2:          00:32:05       And I can't find that anywhere else in one place like that. It's not just them broadcasting when they retweet something or when they tweet something, there's a whole conversation about it. So, you know, some people will say, this is, this has not been my experience or this is not, this is not true for me. Or actually have you seen this connected thing and I, I just go down this rabbit hole and I, I learned so much, but that's not the experience for everyone. No. Well yeah. It's not the experience for everyone and it's not really. I don't think it's what everyone wants either. Sometimes people just like to go on there and

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       talk shit. I mean if someone that's trapped in a cubicle right now and they just want to go on there and get in arguments about gun control or you know, whether or not Nancy Polosi is the devil and this is, this is what it, it serves a purpose for them. The thing that gets strange though is who's to decide. You know, there's this, there's this concept, there's a discussion I should say where, uh, some people believe that things like twitter or facebook or any forum where you're having a public discussion should be considered almost like a public utility. Like anyone has access to the electric power. Even if you're, you know, even if you're a racist, you still can get electricity and some people think that you should have that same ability with something like twitter or the same ability with something like instagram. Obviously this is, we're in uncharted territory and you are, you are in uncharted territory.

Speaker 1:          00:33:35       Totally. It just, no one has been there before. So who makes the distinctions when you see someone that, that it's saying something that you might think is offensive to some folks but not offensive to the person who's saying it. Maybe the person who's saying it feels like they need to express themselves and this is important to say and how do you decide whether or not this is a valid discussion or if this is air quotes, hate speech, which is, you know, there's some things that are hate speech and there's sometimes people use the term hate speech and it's just a cheap way to shut down a conversation. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:34:11       we. So the simple answer is we look at conduct. We don't, we don't look at the speech itself. We look at conduct. We look at how the tool is being used. And you're, you're right in that like I think when people see twitter, they see and they expect it to be a public square. They can go into that public square, they can say whatever they want, they can get on a pedestal and people might gather around them and listen to what they have to say. Some of them might find it offensive and they leave. The difference is there's, there's also this concept of this megaphone and the megaphone can be highly targeted now with twitter as well. So it's not, it's not the, it's not the speech, it's how it's amplified.

Speaker 1:          00:34:54       So what do you do is say, let's say there's someone in the media, uh, let's say it's a prominent feminist and then you have a bunch of people or let's say just one person and their twitter feed is overwhelmingly attacking this prominent feminist. Just constantly attacking her, calling her a liar, calling her this calling that when do you decide this is harassment? When decide this is hate speech when like how do you, I mean this is a look at the conduct is a fictional account. Write fictional person we're talking about. But in this, for instance, what, what would dictate something that was egregious enough for you to eliminate them from your plan?

Speaker 2:          00:35:32       Well, that's a. that's a. that's a heavy action. So that's a last. But we look at the conduct. We look at oftentimes as you said, like the probability of someone who is harassing one person, it's highly probable that they're also passing 10 more people, right? So we can look at that behavior. We can look at how many times this person is being blocked or muted or reported, and based on all those, all that data, we can actually take some action, but we also have to. We have to correlate it with the other side of that because people go on and they coordinate blocks as well and they coordinate harassment and they and they coordinate. I'm sorry, not harassment, but reporting. I'm reporting a particular account to get it shut down into a to take the voice off the service. So these are the considerations we have to make, but it's.

Speaker 2:          00:36:28       It's. It all starts with conduct and all. Oftentimes we'll see coordinated conduct, whether it be that one person opening multiple counts or coordinating with multiple accounts that they don't own to, you know, go after someone and there's a bunch of vectors that people use, retweet for that, uh, the quote tweet for that a lot as well. Like, you know, they'll quote tweet a tweet that someone finds and they'll say, look at this idiot twitter to your thing and then just this mob starts and goes and tries to, uh, effectively shut that person down. Um, so there's a bunch of tools we can use. The permanent suspension is the last resort. One of the things that we can do is we can down rank the replies. So any of these, any of these behaviors and conduct that looks link linked, we can actually, uh, push farther down in the supply chain.

Speaker 2:          00:37:22       So it's all still there. But you might have to push a button to actually see it. You might have to say, show more replies to actually see this harassing account or what might look like harassing language. And there's this manually done or no, this is, this is all, this is all automated. It's automated. Yeah. Yeah. But how would you the ranking in the end, looking at amplification and looking at the network is automated, right? Like in terms of ranking, is there a discussion as to whether or not this person's reply should be down ranked? Like how do you, how do you figure that out? It's a machine learning and deep learning model and they say I and they and they learn, you know, and we, we look at, we look at how these things are doing and where they make mistakes and then we improve it.

Speaker 2:          00:38:08       It's just constantly improving, constantly learning. And does that feel like censorship to you? Like automated censorship doesn't mean who, who is to decide other than people whether or not something is valid? Well, we're not, we're not looking at the, at the speech. In this particular case, we're looking at the conduct, the conduct, the conduct of someone in fast velocity attacking someone else. Right? So those are the things that our technology allows changes, the velocity of changes, uh, how to broadcast a message that someone didn't really ask for and didn't want to hear. We don't touch. If I follow Joe Rogan, you'll see every single tweet. We don't touch it, right? But that's an audience that you earn. But in your replies page we have a little bit more room because this is a, this is a conversation that starts up and some people just want to disrupt it.

Speaker 2:          00:39:02       And all we're saying is we're going to look at moving the disruption down. Not that it's hidden, but it's still there. But you know, you just see a little bit farther down. Like there was a, what was the incidence with Ari? I should text him right now, get them to answer me in real time, but are you should fear got kicked off twitter because he said something to bird like bird, I'm going to fucking kill you. Bert Kreischer being our good friend, all of us are good friends and he's like, you fucking dummy. I'm going to kill you. Or something like that as a record albums. He said he was gonna steal and I'm breaking and got jokingly got mad. Right, right, right. That's already though Bert. Bert was. I think it was all bullshit. Right? I don't think Bert really stole his. Him. Yeah. He gave them back to them eventually.

Speaker 2:          00:39:41       Yeah. Yeah. He's like, I'm going to fucking kill you. So what happened there? What probably happened there, and I'm not sure of the particular case, but will probably happen there, is someone might have reported that tweet one of our agents, a human agents without context of their friendship or that relationship, uh, saw it as a violent threat and took action on it. Right? And those are the mistakes that we're going to make. That's why we need an appeals process. And Burt needs to keep his fucking greasy hands off. Are his records. Right? That's probably not going to happen. We need to, we need to make sure we need to make sure that we're reacting to the right way. Like, look, we're going to make mistakes where we're trying to. That. The problem with the system right now is most of the most of the work is actually in the burden is actually on the victims of abuse while they're getting harassed, so a lot of our system doesn't enforce or act and less, uh, these tweets are reported, right?

Speaker 2:          00:40:42       So we don't take suspension actions or removal of content actions in less that reported the algorithms rank and order the conversation, but they don't take suspension actions, they don't take, they don't remove content. They might suggest to human to look at this who might look at our rules and look at the content and, and try to look at the context of the conversation and then take action. But we would like to move towards a lot more automated enforcement. But more importantly, how do we, how do we highlight, how do we amplify more of the healthier discussion conversation? Again, not removing it, I, I, we're, we're, we're going to a world, especially with technology like blockchain, that all content that exists, that has ever created will exist forever. You won't be able to take it down. You won't be able to censor it. It won't be centralized at all.

Speaker 2:          00:41:42       Our role is around what we recommend based on your interest and based on who you follow and and, and helping you to get into that onramp. But if you look at the architect neurology, it's a given that anytime something is created, it's going to exist forever. This is what blockchain helps enable down the line and we need to make sure that we're paying attention to that and also realizing that, you know, our role is like how do we, how do we get people the stuff that they really want to see in the find valuable that they'll learn from, that they'll make them think that will help them evolve the conversation as well.

Speaker 1:          00:42:24       Now when you say amplify the messages that you deem to be more positive, right? Like how do you decide that people decided? People decide. People decide it based on like are they, are they engaging in replies? Are they, are they read tweeting it? Are they liking it? Are they. Sometimes it's really negative, like sometimes the people that are engaging and they're engaging in because they're attacking someone. So d, is that valuable or is it just unfortunate?

Speaker 2:          00:42:51       It's valuable. I mean every, every signal is something that we can learn from and we can act on, but it, it's going to constantly evolve. I mean it's, these, these, these models that we have to build will constantly have to learn what the network is doing and how people are using it. And um, you know, our, our goal is healthy contribution back to the public conversation, that that is what we want. We want to encourage people into more, bigger informative, global conversations that they'll learn from.

Speaker 1:          00:43:26       Are you like constantly aware of how much this is changing society and that you are one of the four or five different modalities that are radically changing society, whether it's facebook or instagram or any of these social media companies. It's radically changing the way people communicate with each other. Like there's a, there's a, a giant impact on the way human beings talk and see each other and the way we process ideas and the way we distributed information. It's unprecedented. There's never been anything like that before. And you setting up something that you think is going to be a group chat. Do you remember the early days when you would say like at Jack is going to the movies and you would say like that's how we'd say it. I would say at Joe Rogan is on his way to dinner. That's how people would do. It's fucking. It was weird that somewhere along the line that morphed

Speaker 2:          00:44:19       and that's what the world wanted to do with it. That's where, that's where they wanted to take that. Yeah, and I just think it's so reflective of, of what the world is and in some cases what the world wants to

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       be, so it's a a pathway for thinking. Just a pathway for people to get their thoughts out, but a really powerful one and unprecedented method of distributing information. It's really nothing ever been like this before. No, no, and in it, it won't. This, this mode of communicating will not go away. It'll just get faster. It will, it will become a lot more connected and that's why our work is so critical to figure out some of the dynamics at play that, that, um, that make it a, that, that caused more negative outcomes and positive outcomes. I, I think about it because, uh, well I think about it because it's, it's just a hugely significant thing, but I also think about it because of podcasts because podcasts are in a similar way, just no one saw it coming and the people that are involved in that are like, what the fuck are we doing now?

Speaker 1:          00:45:34       Like me, I'm like, what am I doing? Like, what is this? No, like for me, it's like, oh boy, I get to talk to guys like Ben Greenfield and, and Jonathan Haidt and all the, all these different people and learn some stuff. And I've have clearly learned way more from doing this podcast than I ever would have learned without it. No doubt about it unquestionably. But I didn't, I didn't fucking plan as. So now all of a sudden there is this a signal that I'm sending out to millions and millions of people and then people are like, well, you have a responsibility. I'm like, oh great. Why didn't want that? I didn't want to responsibility to what, what I distribute. I just wanted to be able to have a freak show. Just talk to people like what? Whatever. You know, like there's certain people that will have on whether it's Alex Jones or anyone that's controversial where people will get fucking mad.

Speaker 1:          00:46:22       Why are you giving this person a platform? I go, okay, I didn't think about it that way and I don't think that's what I'm doing. I think I'm talking to people and you can listen. Yeah. But it's giving that person a platform because they say, well no, they'll tone down there like Milo Yiannopoulos. That was one of the arguments people gave me, like he toned down his platform when he was on your show so you could get more people to pay attention to them. Like, okay. But he also talked about he, he. That was one of the reasons why he was exposed was my show because he talked about that it's okay to have sex with underage boys if they're gay because there like a mentor relationship between the older gay man, the young and people were like, what the fuck are you talking about? And that was a big part of why he's kind of been removed from the public conversation.

Speaker 1:          00:47:07       That was one of the thing. And then there's the discussion like, well what is that? What is removing someone from the public conversation if someone is very popular and they have all these people that like to listen to them. Like what is the responsibility of these platforms, whether it's youtube or twitter or, or anyone know what is their responsibility to decide whether or not someone should or shouldn't be able to speak. And this is a thing that I've been struggling with and I've been. I bounced around inside my own head and I see that you guys struggle with it and pretty much everyone does. Youtube does. And it's, um, it, it is a hugely significant discussion that is left to a very relatively small amount of people. And this is why this discussion of what is social media, is it something that everybody has a right to or is it something that should be restricted to only people that are willing to behave and carry themselves in a certain way? I believe it's something that everyone has a right to everyone has a right to, but you still banned people, like say like, like Alex Jones, you guys were the last guys to keep Alex Jones on the platform. You were the last ones and I believe you hung in there until he started harassing you personally, right?

Speaker 2:          00:48:23       No, no, he, he did come your house. He begged. He uh, you know, he, he did very different things on our platform versus the others. So we saw this domino effect over a weekend of one platform, a Banningham and then another, another, another very, very quick succession. And you know, people I think would have assumed that we would just have followed suit, but he didn't violate our terms of service. And afterwards he did. And, and we have, you know, we have a, we have a policy and if, if, uh, you know, the, there was a violation, we take enforcement actions. One might be asking the account holder to delete the tweet, another might be a temporary suspension, another might be a permanent suspension.

Speaker 1:          00:49:15       So were you saying the solar, let's use it in terms of like him saying that Sandy Hook was fake. He did not say that on the platform. He did not say that on twitter. He always said that on his show.

Speaker 2:          00:49:25       I don't know. I don't know all the mediums he set it in. What did he do? What we're looking at is the, is the conduct and what he did on our,

Speaker 1:          00:49:33       our platform. So what did he do on your platform that was like, that you all were in agreement that this is enough?

Speaker 2:          00:49:39       Uh, I'm not, I'm not sure what the, what the actual like, you know, violations were. But we have a, we have a set number of actions and if they keep getting, if, if, if an account keeps violent in terms of service, ultimately it leads to permanent suspension. And when all the other platforms we're taking them off, we didn't find those. We didn't. We didn't find those violations and they weren't reported. But again, it goes back to a lot of our model, people weren't reporting a lot of the tweets that may have been in violation on our service and we didn't act on them.

Speaker 1:          00:50:18       Right. I'm like a good instances. What's going on with Patrion? I'm sure you're aware of the Sargon of cod thing. He did a podcast a long time ago, I believe, six months or so ago where he used the n word and the way he used it as a actually against white nationalists and he also said a bunch of other stuff and they decided Patriot undecided that what he said on a podcast was enough for them to remove him from the platform even though he didn't do anything on their platform. That was agregious. And also they had previously stated that they were only judging things that occurred on their platform. There's been a giant blow back because of that, because people are saying, well now you're. You're essentially policing and not based on his actions. Just on concepts and the communication that he was using, the way he was talking a year, you are eliminating him from being able to make a living and that you are doing this because he does not fit into your political paradigm the way you want to view the world. He views the world differently. This is an opportunity for you to eliminate someone who you disagree with.

Speaker 2:          00:51:31       Yeah, I mean I don't know the nuances of their policy, but like we have to pay attention to folks who are using twitter to shut down the voices of others. Right. That's where it gets weaponized and we also have to pay attention to where people are using it that put other folks in physical danger and that is where we need to be most severe, but otherwise everyone has a right to these technologies and I think they also have a right to make sure that they have a very simple and open read of the rules and we're not in a great state. There are rules and our enforcement can be extremely confusing to people.

Speaker 1:          00:52:12       What has been the one thing that came up that was perhaps the most controversial, like I know my friend Sam Harris was trying to get you guys to ban Donald Trump. He was saying if the fall, your terms of service. I just did a podcast with him. Actually, you should come out today or tomorrow. He's. He's. He's a fascinating guy. Sam Harris. I love him to death, but what he was trying to do is like saying, hey, he's threatening nuclear war. Like he's saying, Hey Korea, my bombs are bigger than your bombs. Like what else does the guy have to do to get you to remove them from the platform? When you guys saw that, what was your reaction to that? Was there an internal discussion about actually banning the president of United States?

Speaker 2:          00:52:54       Well, so the two things there. One, it was the context that presidents of this country have you similar language in different mediums. They use it on radio, they use it on television. It's not just through twitter and even if you were looking at you were to look at the presidency of Obama. It wasn't exactly the same tone in this exact same language, but there were threats around the same country and we to take that context into consideration. So the second thing is that we need the most controversial aspect of our rules and our terms of services. Probably the claws around public interest in newsworthiness where I'm powerful figures are public figures, might be in violation of our terms of service, but the tweet itself is of public interest. Yes, there should be a conversation around it and that is probably the thing that people disagree with the most.

Speaker 2:          00:54:04       Um, and where we have a lot of internal debate, but we also have some pretty hard lines. If we had a global leader, including the president of United States, make a violent threat against a private individual, we would take action. We, we always have to balance that with like, is this a, is this something that the public has interest in? In I, I believe generally the answer is yes. It's not going to be in every case, but generally the answer is yes. Because we should see how our leaders think and how they act in essentially forms voting that informs the conversation. Then forms whether we think they're going to, they're doing the right job or we think that, you know, they should be, they should be voted out well.

Speaker 1:          00:54:48       It's very important to see how someone uses that platform and when someone uses it the way he uses it and then becomes president and continues to use it that way. That's when people are like, what? He's been consistent and I think he, I think he joined

Speaker 2:          00:55:01       then in 2009, 2012 and you look at all of his tweets all the way back then. And it's pretty consistent.

Speaker 1:          00:55:07       Yeah. Being he likes to insult people on twitter. It's fun for him. He does. It's just. I never thought he would keep doing it. I thought once he became president maybe just lock it down and try to do a good job for the country and then, you know, after four years or eight years, just go back to his old self, fuck you fuck the world. Fuck this. But no, he's, he's, he's just, it's just in one way it's hilarious. See as a comedian, I think it's awesome because it's just, it's so hilariously stupid. It's so preposterous. That even has the time to talk about Jeff Bezos is a fair and the fact that he got caught with the national enquirer, getting text messages and calls him Jeff Bozos like, don't you have shit to do man? As. But as a comedian, I, I, I am a gigantic fan of folly.

Speaker 1:          00:55:58       Almost a against my better judgment. I like watching. It's, I, I've watched. I like watching disasters. I like watching chaos. When I see nonsense like that, I'm like, oh Jesus, I'm drawn like a motto flame. But on the other part of me is like, man, this sets a very bizarre tone for the entire country because one of the things about like Obama or hate Obama as he was very measured, very articulate, obviously very well educated, and I think that that aspect of his presidency was very good for all of us because he represented something that was of a very high standard in terms of his ability to communicate his access to words, the way the way measured his words and held himself. I think that that's good for us. Let's just parishioner. Well it's. Yeah. It's like, look at that guy. He's better than me.

Speaker 1:          00:56:54       That's why he's the president. But you know, you lady see trump, he doesn't talk better than me. He does. He doesn't use twitter better. He's not. He's just this fucking madman. But isn't an important to understand that and to see it. Hopefully that informs opinions and actions 100 percent. That's my point. That's my point is that this is this weird gray area where I think overall I definitely support your decision to not, not banned him for violating your terms of service. We need to know, yeah, you know, and it's how do you know, how many accounts are bots, how many [inaudible] do you know, how many accounts are from a Russian troll farm, how do you know that?

Speaker 2:          00:57:38       So this is a real challenge and something that we're, uh, we're trying to wrap our heads around, but one of the things we're trying to do is like let's scope the problem down a bit and let, let's use the technology we have available to us. Like face Id, touch id, like the biometric stuff to identify the humans.

Speaker 1:          00:57:56       Let's identify the humans first APP because it face id is not really available. Is it available to you guys? Did you know you just leave leaks?

Speaker 2:          00:58:02       We shouldn't have done that. No, we haven't. We haven't used it yet. But you can use it for things like, is this like a human operating this say you can use it for that. So it's, it's completely locked into the local device. We don't have access to images of your face or whatnot, but the operating system can tell us that this is the legit owner of this phone and therefore it is, it is human and technology always has to change. People will find ways around that and whatnot. But if we go the opposite direction and we look for the bots, the problem with looking for the bots boxes, people assume that they just come through our api, but the scripting has become extremely sophisticated. People can script the APP, can script the website and make it look very, very human. So we're going after this problem first trying to identify the humans as much as we can. Utilizing these technologies, you know, of this is live right now. These are, these are considerations that we're making and trying to understand like what the impact would be and, and, uh, how we might evolve it, but we need to because that information would provide context for someone like this is an actual human that I'm talking to and I can invest more time in it where I can just ignore the thing because it's meaningless.

Speaker 1:          00:59:19       Now is apple to share that with you, I mean when you, when you're talking about biometrics, fingerprints or face,

Speaker 2:          00:59:26       it's not the data, it's just the operating system verifies that there's an individual as an individual and it's unlocking know, like, like, um, you know, when, when you use the, um, our cash app uses us, right? So squares, cash APP. When you want to make a transfer to someone when you want to send someone money or when you want to buy Bitcoin, we turn on face id and you verify that you are, you and you are the owner of the phone and then it goes. We don't get images of your face. We don't see who you are. Oh, that's what you want me to think. I know that's how locked down by the operating system and that's what it should be, right? Sure. Um, what, has there ever been any consideration to not allowing people to post anonymously? Well, like what you said earlier about journalists and whistleblowers that is political.

Speaker 2:          01:00:20       So look at a look at platforms that have a real names policy. Look at facebook or other problems. Any different. I don't know because I don't go there, but for I understand there's a lot of still a lot of arguing there. It's the same at a political argument if the same vectors, same patterns. I think older, like older in general it seems. I also am not really hanging out there, but it seems a little bit older. It's a lot of grammys looking at pictures of their kids, grandkids and stuff and that's what it was made for about. It's connecting, it's connecting with the people that you know and that to me is the biggest difference for twitter. It's connecting with the people you don't know what they find interesting and like it's around. It's around topics and stuff that you find that you want to learn more about when you saw it.

Speaker 1:          01:01:02       Zuckerberg testifying and in, in realizing like how this platform is being used and what are the dangers of this, and then you see these senators that really don't know what the fuck the technology is or it's wow, it really highlights how we're set up to this. Really. Yeah. Well, not just a gap, a gap in the critical understanding of how these things work and what they are in terms of how these really important politicians who are the ones who are making these decisions as to whether or not someone has violated laws or whether or not something should be curbed or regulated. They don't really even understand what they're talking about.

Speaker 2:          01:01:44       No, I mean there's, there's a few people do because they're not, they're not using it directly. They're not using in the way that people are using it every single day and I'll have the same experience that people have every single day and you know, in terms of regulatory and our regulators and our government's. I, you know, we, I think the conversation is often about how regulators will come in and start writing rules and, and setting expectations for how companies or services might behave, but there's a role for the company to educate and there's a role for the company to, on like what technology makes possible, whether it be positive and also some of the negatives. So that become possible as well. So I think we have a role to help educate and to, and to help make sure that we're really, we're, we're, we're pushing towards what I think the job of regular regulator is, which is number one, protect the individual number to level the playing field and make sure that those two things are not compromised by special interests trying to protect their own domain or profits or, or a dominance within a particular market.

Speaker 2:          01:02:55       What do you mean by level? The playing field level, the playing field so that a, an individual has the same opportunity, uh, that uh, someone else might have or a company might have. So. Okay. So like anybody, anyone, anyone can have a twitter account and you know, they have, uh, at least, uh, you know, an equal opportunity to contribute to it and whatever they do with it will change the change the outcome. Some people might become very popular because they're saying stuff people want to hear. Some people won't see any following whatsoever because they're not adding anything original or interesting or, or, uh, we're different in terms of perspective.

Speaker 1:          01:03:35       Where do you see this going? When you look at these kind of emerging technologies, not necessarily emerging anymore, established now, but still, you know, a, a new thing in relative terms of human history, where do you see this going and does it get more intrusive? Does it get deeper into our lives? Like what, what? And when you look at new technologies like augmented reality and things along those lines, do you see new possibilities and new things to make things even more complicated?

Speaker 2:          01:04:05       I mean, yeah, I mean we just have to assume the, we, we naturally use more and more technologies. More and more things become open. More and more things, uh, increase their velocity. There's more communication, not less like this is not going away and it's just, it's just a question of what we do with it. So where, where I want it to go as an where I want twitter specifically to go is I, you know, I, I think it's existential right now that we, we, we have global conversations about some things that will become crisis climate change being one of them. There was no one nation state that's going to solve that problem alone. Economic disparity being another, the the rise of Ai and a job displacement and just like us offloading decisions to these, to these algorithms, those are the things that, that no one nation, no one community is going to solve alone. It takes the entire world to do so, so I want to make sure that we're doing our best to get people seeing these global conversations and ideally participating in them because it helps. It helps us solve the problems. I just believe that more open society allows us to solve problems much faster.

Speaker 1:          01:05:24       So you in many ways see twitter is having some sort of a social responsibility in this.

Speaker 2:          01:05:30       Totally. Totally. Totally. Yeah. And I think a big part of is like right now, like how are we, how are we ensuring that there is more healthy contribution to that global conversation and you know, I, I just think it's so critical that we start talking about the things that are facing all of us, not just one nation. I do think you know that that's where our current model really puts the world at a disadvantage because it incentivizes more of the elk echo chambers, which lead to things like nationalism. Instead of taking the broader picture and looking at what's happening around the world to all people, to all of humanity,

Speaker 1:          01:06:12       what do you do though to balance the conversation or what responsibility do you think you have to balance the conversation in terms of the way conservatives view it versus the way liberals and progressives view it? Balance. It shows there, is there a responsibility? Do you have a responsibility or is it just leave it up to the people and let them figure it out the same way they figured out hashtags and everything else.

Speaker 2:          01:06:35       I think we have a responsibility to make it easier to do that easier. How so? Right now it's just. It's just too hard. Most most people will not venture outside their mindset. They will. They will not venture out. They will not break their bubble, but if you. Because it's right now on the surface, it's just so hard to do that. I, I can only follow accounts and I have to, I have to look into and just imagine like, you know, trying to get an understanding of your own politics. People can't just look at your bio, they have to look through all your tweets, they have to listen to a bunch of your podcasts and whatnot. And that's a bunch of work. If we shifted more towards topics and interest, at least we have the potential to see a bunch more perspectives. We see. Do that. The simplest thing as like follow a Hashtag, follow a topic, like why can't you just follow warriors twitter or uh, you know, NBA, twitter, why do you have to go and find all the coaches and the players and, and the team. So we can do that. We can help make that a whole lot easier for folks.

Speaker 1:          01:07:41       So there's something like brexit or something like that. So if you go to Hashtag Brexit, you're going to get the whole conversation. You're going to get the pros, the cons, the left, the right, the whole deal, the centrists. You're going to get everybody versus following the people that you already follow that agree with what you think

Speaker 2:          01:07:58       the probability is higher that you'll get more, you'll get more variety of perspectives and not even doesn't even follow Brexit, follow vote leave if you want to leave, but within that topic there might be some dissenting opinions and you get to choose whether you those inform you, whether that emboldens your or not,

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       but and, and again, I'm not saying that we should force that upon it, but it's not easy to even do that today, right? The only tool we give you is finding and following the accounts and that's what people search hashtags. They do search, right? They don't. They send the timeline. I mean it is a small percentage of people that people that really know twitter know how to do that, but most people, they follow an account and they stand the timeline and what their world is, their timeline. Hashtags can be corrupted to totally. They can be gamed. It can be gamed and taken over. I took over Hashtag Vegan cat go to and what is, what is it? It's a wrap. That's mine. Now.

Speaker 1:          01:08:56       My last, my last Netflix special about a woman who said a bunch of horrible things to me, uh, because I put a picture up on instagram of some deer meat and I wrote this is some meat from a deer that liked to kick babies and was about to join isis. And I wrote Hashtag Vegan, which was a mistake right to the right. Hashtag Vegan, but the Hashtag Vegan people went fucking crazy and came after me because I entered into their timeline with meat hashtag vegan cat. It's all either pictures of see like it says Joe Rogan right up. Thank you. I haven't laughed that hard to while Hashtag Vegan cat. It's people that are feeding their fucking cat vegan food and they're all dying. And I in the specialist say every cat looks like it's living in a house with a gas leak. Like they're all like laying down like where the fuck is the real food?

Speaker 1:          01:09:44       But this is real. Like this is just a conversation to have. But the thing is, if someone does something like that, like you can like pick a person, you know, whatever that person is, whatever they're, they're, they're doing, if they have a Hashtag that they utilize all the time for their movement or whatever, someone could mock them and then use that. And if it's a public figure or someone who's got a prominent voice, then all of a sudden that Hashtag becomes people just take it over and start mocking them with that Hashtag. But it has to be done in mass. I mean, it has to be coordinated. And sometimes people like figure out how to gain the system and coordinate it in a, amplify that message in an unfair way. And, and that's what, that's what our systems are trying to recognize. How sick did that cat look?

Speaker 1:          01:10:27       Fucking cat. That was a real one. That was a real Hashtag Vegan cat. Wow. Support Bastards. Um, so when you look back at emerging social media, like we go all the way back to my space, my space, you got Tom, Tom was sitting there and you're in your top eight and you know, people would like post music that they liked and it was never political. It was very often very surface. And for comics it was a great way to promote shows and it was, it was an interesting way to see things. But it was, it was like, like the seed that became twitter or facebook or any of these is one of them. I think we, at least for us, like we got more of our roots from

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       aol instant messenger and Icq Icq because it was, you know, you remember the status message where you said like, I'm in a meeting or I'm listening to music or watching a movie right now. That was the inspiration. And what we took from that was being able to, like, if you could do that from anywhere, not bound to a desk, but you could do that from anywhere. And you could do it from your phone and you could just be roaming around and say, you know, I'm at, I'm at Joe Rogan's, um, studio right now, that is cool. I don't need my computer. I'm not bound to this chain, to this desk. I can, I can do it from anywhere. And then the other aspect of, of, in some messenger was of course chat. So one of the things that the status would do is you might, you might say like, you know, I'm listening to Kendrick Lamar right now and I might hit you up on chat and say like, what do you, what do you think of the new album?

Speaker 2:          01:12:02       But now it's all public so everyone can see it. That's, that's the biggest difference in the. And that's, that to me is what twitter is. It might, my space was, it was profiles and you know, people organized around these profiles and uh, this network that develop between people. And that is facebook, facebook, facebook optimized the hell out of that. And they scaled the world. We, we were something very different. We, you know, we, we started with a simple status and then people wanted to talk about it and we, we decided that it should be on the same surface, it shouldn't be suburbian to the, to the, to the status, it should be part of that flow. And that's what makes twitter so fluid.

Speaker 1:          01:12:49       Now when you look at this sort of metamorphosis, this evolution between those initial social media, whether it's aol instant messenger that eventually became Lux Icq. And what was that one that we would use that gamers would use? That it was like a all live stream sort of message board for awhile people were using teamspeak but I don't know. No it wasn't, that wasn't, that wasn't teamspeak it was. I'm like you would go there and share files and stuff and people would uh, would, would go, like if I used to play a lot of online video games and we play on teams and we have teams go play other teams and he would use this sort of a. It was like, it wasn't a message board because it was all in real time. What the fuck was it called? No. Alright, forget it. Anyway, uh, guys would go there and you could send people files through it and teams would go and meet and it would be a chat, like an online chat that would be in real time.

Speaker 2:          01:13:55       Yeah, it's, yeah. I mean we have a lot of our roots and aol instant messenger, but also like IRC Internet relay chat and use nut which were the, you know, these old internet seventies technologies is what I was talking about. IRC. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So Internet relay chat is, is like this giant room that anyone can join and so range around topics and

Speaker 1:          01:14:14       that's what's interesting about that is you could see people typing, see it occurring in real time, see it popping up in real time, you know, I'm just wonder like what is the next evolution of this? Because because no one saw anything going from ICQ to twitter, no one saw anything going from that to instagram and to where we're at right now where it really does flavor the conversation of our entire culture. I mean, before it was just a thing that was happening that was happening on people's computers. Now it's a thing that's happening on people's computers and now phones and now your whole life. It's a, it's, it's a very different influence and I wonder because everything does accelerate things constantly move forward and become more and more, more and more integrated into our life experience. And I wonder what is the next stage of this

Speaker 2:          01:15:09       if I mean like the, the secular trends and you know, you look at technology and you look at technologies like blockchain for instance, and I think, you know, we're, we're moving to a world where anything created exists forever, um, that there's no centralized control over who sees what, um, that, uh, you know, these, these, these models become completely decentralized and all these barriers that we, that exist today aren't as important anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:15:44       Something like Gab, Gab seems to be a response to the fact that some people are getting banned from other platforms and they're just allowing anybody to come on and say anything they want. The downside of that is, of course the most horrible people are going to be able to say anything they want with no repercussions. The good side is anybody can say whatever they want.

Speaker 2:          01:16:05       Yeah. I haven't studied them too much, but I do know that they have taken action on accounts as well. They have suspended accounts and they, if they have a terms of service as well, what are they suspended accounts for it. I don't know. It's probably conduct related. It's probably, it might be doxing. I'm probably right, but it's just a, it's just a question of like, you know, the rules and if you agree to the rules then you sign up for the service and if, if not there will be other services. But like if you look at, you look at the trends and I think um, you know, certainly things become a lot more public and certainly things become a lot more open. Certainly the berries and the boundaries that we have in place today become less meaningful and I think there's a lot of positives in that. And I, I also think there's a lot of danger that we need to be mindful of. Now you as a ceo,

Speaker 1:          01:16:58       oh, as a guy who's running this thing, what, what is this? Is the experience been like for you? Because I got to imagine that it wasn't anything that you predicted. No. Predicted twitter,

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       right? Yeah. So to all the sudden have this responsibility, what are changing everything. I mean it. And you're a young guy. How old are you? Forty two. That's young to be in control of that much and to have it over the time of what has it been 11 years or 10 years old? They're 13 and Marcela. Yeah. So you were really fucking young, like what has that been like for you? It's been a, it's been both beautiful and scary and uncomfortable and learning. It's just been a ton of learning and evolving and it shows me every single day where I need to push myself and what I don't know. And uh, and I think a big part is just the realization that we're not gonna be able to do this alone. And I don't think we have to either the, these are, these are what the technologies that continue to allow us, we can, if we have to have all the answers around enforcement or policy when we're not going to serve the world, we have aspirations to serve every single person on the planet and we have aspirations to, you know, be the first consideration for the global public conversation.

Speaker 2:          01:18:17       And you know, if, if we're the bottleneck for all this, we're not going to reach those aspirations. So it just thinking deeply about how we might distribute more of this work and decentralize more of it and look at look at the platform itself and like what we need to change to reach that reality. And I think we got to look really deepened. Foundational that it goes back to, you know, the, the, your question on 1:40, one of the things that we saw was, you know, we, we shifted to 280 characters and that, you know, there's 140 characters is so sacred. You know, it, it became this cultural thing and I was in love with it. And so many people are in love with it, but one of the things we noticed as we move to two 80 is that the vast majority of tweets that are broadcasts don't go above 1:40 even with that limitation raced, but where they do go above a 1:40 is in replies when people reply, they tend to go over the hundred 40 character limit and even bump up into the two to 80 limit and what it allowed, what we've seen it allow us just more nuance in the conversation and allows people to give more context and, and uh, and kind of just get their experience on the table a little bit more, whereas 1:40 did not allow that.

Speaker 2:          01:19:37       So we, we have seen that increase the health of those conversations and the discussion. So it's stuff like that that we need to question and not hold. So, so sacred. Is there any consideration to expanding it further? Uh, now, right now we were about a million characters. I know. Well, we don't have edit tweets right now. So we did. That's good or bad. Well, if you can't edit a 140 characters, you're going to be really pissed off if you write a million characters in cad. Those things, you know what I would like, I would like the ability to edit, like if you make a typo or something like that, but also the ability for people to see the original like edit, but see the original. Let's say we're looking at exactly that. Oh really? We're looking at exactly that. The reason we don't have it in the first place is we were born on sms, were born on text messaging.

Speaker 2:          01:20:23       When you send a tax, you can't take it back. Right? So when you send a tweet, it goes to the world instantaneously. You can't take it back. So when we have to exist anyway, I mean, no matter what, if you send someone something, even if you're on Instagram, people are gonna know the original. Yeah, they screenshot it and they do their thing, but like you could build it such that, you know, maybe we introduce a five second to 32nd delay in the sending and within that window you can edit. I'm going to need more time than that. Do it. If I fucked something up, I like someone has to tell me, but did you misspelled that word? Oh Shit. Did I? God Damn it. The issue. Autocorrect gets you totally, but the issue with going longer than that, it takes that real time. Nature of the conversation will flow out of it.

Speaker 2:          01:21:08       Then we're delaying these tweets and like when you're watching UFC, are you watching like warriors basketball? A lot of. A lot of the great twitter is just like in the moment, just like you know, it's the roar of the crowd. It's like, you know, looking across a at someone you're in this virtual stadium with and just saying like, oh my God, that shot. Can you believe it? But this isn't clarity more important because you're not. It depends on the context that you still have the ability to communicate quickly, but you also have the ability to clarify. That's, that's where we need to really pay attention because if you're, if you're in the context of an NBA game, you want to be fast and you just won't be able to moment and you just, you don't want to be raw, but if you're in the context of considering what the president just did or making a particular statement, then you probably need some, some more time and we can be dynamic there.

Speaker 2:          01:22:00       What's interesting to me is how few people use video. Like I thought when you guys have video on twitter, I'm like, wow, a bunch of people going to be making videos and putting those up on twitter and it's not, it's not that often. It depends on who you follow it. It's huge for some aspects of twitter. It's, it's, uh, it's less so in others, but aspects is huge for um, a lot, a lot of sports. I mean we see a lot of like just the replays and the recaps for sure, you know, aspects of a, of a particular shot that people want to comment on. I don't like. I think it's dangerous for us to focus too much on the medium, whether it be images or gifts or video. It's, it's more about the conversation around it. That's what we want to optimize for. It's definitely very popular for sports and, and folly. And you know, there's uh, what is, uh, there's, there's a bunch of animal attack videos. Yeah. Nature is metals a good one and hold my beer. That's another good one. I mean it's all videos, but what I meant was people making a video talking about something. This is what I was trying

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       to say, what I think is this and that and blah blah blah. You don't see a lot of that. And I thought maybe that would be something that people would adopt more.

Speaker 2:          01:23:13       Two different speed. I think like the, the consumption of video. I mean you see this in the technology right now, like people are subtitling every single video because people might be in an environment where they can't turn the audio on or like a video like I have to scrub through to see what's interesting like it with text. I can just see it and it allows for a lot of serendipity to find something that I probably wouldn't have seen unless I watched the whole damn video. So like the ability to clip something, the ability to like index in I think is really critical. So it's not, to me, it's not about the format, it's about the use case in the context that you're in

Speaker 1:          01:23:49       now. Going back to the responsibility that you guys have and you in particular, like when this became what it is now and when it became evident that it became this gigantic way of changing the way human beings communicate with each other. Was there ever any regret or was there a moment where you're like, what the fuck have I gotten myself into?

Speaker 2:          01:24:16       I mean, um, there's um, always reflective of where I am and what I'm doing. Um, I think the, the biggest has been around, um, twofold. One, how the dynamics of the service allow it to be weaponized in order to silence someone else or to drive them off the surface entirely, which goes against the entire concept of free speech and free participation. Like we, we, we just can't stand for that. We, we, we need to make sure that everyone feels that they have an opportunity at a voice and when you have these coordinated attacks, it, it just, it's not fair. The second is around, you know, this, this concept of an echo chamber and the filter bubble. I, I just, I don't feel personally good about that. I don't feel. I don't feel I'm, that we thought that through enough. In the early days, I think we should have moved a, towards biasing the service towards topics and interests much, much sooner than we are now considering doing

Speaker 1:          01:25:24       no. When you have these considerations, when you take these actions, do you consult with psychologists or sociologists or historians or people that try to put in perspective for you? What the ramifications of each individual move would be?

Speaker 2:          01:25:37       I try to read as much as possible. I try to talk to as many people as possible. Just get completely different perspective. And is there any internal disagreement about actions that you take? Oh yeah. There's, there's always, there's always debate, there's always debate, but I think my role is to ask, ask questions and make sure like, are like what, what is our goal here? What are we trying to do? Um, you know, in that evolves that, that evolves, that evolves like, and is this over the long term going to be a net positive for all humans, all, all humanity. Like how do we balance the considerations of, of how we serve everyone and like how do we get down to something, how do we get down to a fundamental answering the central answer? And that to me is where the real truth is when you can get to something foundational. But I like, you know, I like having conversations with as many people from as many different fields as possible and getting their perspective on it. So I asked questions all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:26:37       It's interesting the way you're phrasing this too, that you, you are looking at this as a method to save or to, to, to help people, to serve people. You're looking at this as a way that you can benefit society. The society can benefit from your platform, can benefit from this, this ability to communicate, um, you're not just looking at it as a tech company that has to remain profitable and that's one of the more interesting things about tech companies to me. I mean, there's been a lot of criticism maybe justified in some ways the tech companies all lean left, but what is interesting to me is that name another corporation that willingly have its own choice, takes that into consideration that they want to serve the world and surf culture in a beneficial way regardless of profit. Yeah. I mean, because you're not really selling anything, right? You guys have a platform, obviously it's financially viable, but you're not, you're not selling things.

Speaker 2:          01:27:43       Well, I mean, we, we, we, we do our models based off people's attention. Yeah. And they're paying us with our attention and that's extremely valuable and something that we need to really, really honor. Um, but I agree with you. I mean like, look at, look at Tesla, you know, I just listened to, uh, um, uh, the, the recent earnings call on. One of the things that you said was, look, there are two reasons, uh, for Tesla, number one is to advance, um, uh, you know, different sources of energy and more renewable sources of energy because it's a fundamental and existential crisis that's facing all humanity. And number two is to advance autonomy because it'll save lives and give people time back. And then you started talking about how to make that possible and that's where our business comes in. How do we, how do we make that possible? And we, we have, uh, we have a great business. We, we need to improve all bunch of it, but we, it, it serves what we think our larger purposes, which is serving the public conversation. We want to see more global public conversations. We want to, we want technology to be used to make the world feel a lot smaller, to help see what common problems we have before us. And ideally, uh, you know, how we can get people together to solve them faster and solve them better.

Speaker 1:          01:29:14       You also seem to be embracing this responsibility that you're, you're helping to evolve culture. And this is part of the pro providing this method of communication, of communication, rather it's helping to evolve culture. And this is a, this is something that is really only applicable to tech companies in some strange way. And it's weird that so many of them have share this. Like I was personally a little weirded out when Google took out. Don't be evil. Like that was a big part of their operating model. Take that out. Yes, yes. Right. Make sure I don't want to get sued. I'm pretty sure they removed that from. What would the, would you call that? Their, their operational directive. Like what is the code of conduct code of conduct and it's not there anymore. Right? They're moved it. So the other article that says they removed the clause and

Speaker 2:          01:30:12       a weird thing to tell people not to be evil,

Speaker 1:          01:30:15       is it? Where did it take it out once you've already said it, it's way weirder to say fuck it, we were wrong. It was another way of saying that they changed it to do the right thing. Yeah. Oh well, what does that mean? The fuck does do the right thing. Mean do the right thing so you can make more money. You know, like, hey, we're going to make money, we'll do the right thing. It makes more money.

Speaker 2:          01:30:36       You know what I mean? It's, I mean, that's, that's why like that's why this openness is so critical. I mean, that's why I like the public comment to me, the public conversation is so important is we can talk about stuff like that and there will be companies forming today that look at um, objectives and mandates like that and base their whole culture around it. And is that the right idea? But if we're not talking about it, we won't be able to answer that question.

Speaker 1:          01:31:00       What's also interesting, because Google is so all encompassing, right? You have gene male, you have enjoyed. I mean that they are the number one operating system for mobile phones in the world on top of being a search engine. There's so much involved in that company. And again, like almost all tech companies, they heavily lean left and they be. Because they had that don't be evil as a part of their code of conduct. It seemed like something that was a good idea to have, like, and it sort of defined what I was talking about that tech companies are uniquely progressive.

Speaker 2:          01:31:41       Yeah, I mean, I dunno, I dunno what makes it, um, I think um, no matter what, like we, the Internet allows for a very healthy skepticism of nearly everything. Um, I'm from, I'm from. It's the show me state. Are you ready? Yeah, I'm from Saint Louis, Missouri. We're all skeptics. My mom was a democrat. My Dad was a republican. My Dad listened to rush limbaugh and Hannity all the time. I found myself somewhere in the middle, but one of the things I appreciate it, we had a ton of fights and arguments and yelling matches around the kitchen table, but like I appreciate the fact that we could have them and I didn't, I felt safe to do so and I didn't feel like, I mean obviously then my parents, but they weren't judging me because of what I said. And they didn't force you to be a republican or a democrat.

Speaker 2:          01:32:38       It forced me to, to, to think a particular way. And I, like, I, I, I think they were good, at least showing different perspectives even in this, in this union that, that they have. And I don't know, it developed. It developed a skepticism in me that I, that I think is, is healthy and I have a lot of skepticism of companies like ours and leaders like me. I think that's right. I think that's right. And people should. And we, I mean I was, I was, I was formed through a lot of the ideals of the Internet. I just fell in love with what it made possible and I, I, I never ever want to run a foul of, of those ideals and, and you know, the, the, the removal of barriers and boundaries and, and the connection that we have because of it. And I, you know, I, I, I think often in reflect often about my role and the centralization of my role in our company and I, I wanna, I wanna figure out and help figure out like how we can continue to add massive value and, and be an amazing business which is, is us and will always be us.

Speaker 2:          01:34:02       But at the same time, be a participant participatory force in this greater good that the Internet has really started and it's not, it's not led by any one individual or anyone company and that's the beauty of it and I want to, I want to make sure that we find our place in that and we can also contribute massively to. And then I think we can, it's just gonna take a lot of work and a lot of introspection and a lot of experimentation, a lot of making mistakes and failures too. Well,

Speaker 1:          01:34:34       it's very encouraging that you have that attitude because a, you know, a lot of people I think in a similar situation would try to control the narrative. They would try to reinforce their own particular perspective on things and try to get other people to adopt it or try to push it. And I think it is, it's very important to just have this open discussion and, and I think it's very important

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       to review your own thoughts and ideas and one of the best ways to do so. Put us through the. Yeah, put it out there, put it out there. And have other people review, peer review is a, is a great process and that's the way this podcast has evolved more than probably anything. That's the thing. I mean you, you, you did this because you want to learn from people and, and the, the platform that you, you've created millions get to learn from it as well and that's just so amazing like I learned from your podcast all the time and that's what technology makes possible. But with that power also comes ramifications and if we're not talking about the ramifications and like at least being open about what we know and what we don't know. And I think we're, I think we state and post a lot more of what we know rather than what we don't know when that is so interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:35:49       Why don't you guys steal? Don't be evil. Put that in your own shit. Fuck. You don't know if that's going to help anything. Then what is that telling our employees that do don't leave. It's real simple. There'll be a dick. Yeah. I mean like how do, how do we, how do we get deeper? And just like seeing more conversation around what is quote unquote eval, have you guys considered expanding your influence in other venues? I'm like, you know, Google started off as a search engine now it's fucking everything. Have you guys considered doing something similar? I think we probably did too much of that early on. And that's what led to a bunch of issues from a, from a corporate standpoint. We're just trying to do too much, too many times. Uh, I dunno, we were trying to be everything to everyone and like, you know, we, we had a, uh, a video thing and we had um, we're looking at um, gaming stuff and messaging and it lost focus of what we are good at.

Speaker 2:          01:36:48       What we're good at is conversation and what we're good at is as public conversation. So we now have, as a company, we have just such an amazing focus on what that means and how that evolves. And there's just, there's some really cool things that we can do. They're like, we have this, we have this app called periscope. And one of the things that we're discovering is like a lot of people are using it to podcast, a lot of people are using it to share their thoughts and these people come in and chat and have a conversation. And uh, one of the things we did recently is we allowed the audio to play in the background. It's super simple, but what we found was that people didn't necessarily want to watch the video of people talking. They just want to hear what they're saying. And that just opened the door for more types of use cases.

Speaker 2:          01:37:37       And there's some really exciting things coming out with periscope that I think add a new dimension to what conversation looks like and how it is experienced and how it evolves. And um, those are the things I get really excited about is like how, how can we conversation better and, and how, uh, you know, how, how do we, how do we make it feel more live? How do we make it feel more, um, electric and a, how do we bring new, um, new technology into it that, that just opens the door for an entirely new way of talking. And, and that's the thing that I think has been most educational to me about twitter as we, you know, as we, as we talked about, we started with this idea of sharing what was happening around you and then people told us what they wanted to wanted it to be and it became this conversational medium.

Speaker 2:          01:38:38       It became this interest networked and it became a, it became a thing that was entirely new and it, you know, we observed it and uh, we learned more and more of what it wanted to be in. We as we get deeper and deeper that we're going to be surprised by some of the technologies that we thought would be used in this way, but it turns out that the, the massive use case and the resonant use case in the fundamental use case is going to be created right before our eyes by the people using it. Now, did you guys acquire periscope? What was required postcode and what was the thought process when you requiring it? Um, we, uh, we liked the live nature of it. We liked the broadcast, uh, aspects, whitey black and why keep it as periscope? Why not have it be like twitter live?

Speaker 2:          01:39:23       There's a, there's a specific community on, on, uh, on periscope. And I think it's interesting from an experimentation standpoint, we can play with ideas there. It's a small tigress I think uses it better than anybody he gets. He's, he's, he's really good at it and he's, he's one that I think has figured out, um, you know, just the NAC behind it, you know, he, he starts every one of them with, uh, with this, uh, simultaneous sip of coffee. So he gets his listeners and his viewers engaged right away. And then he just goes on and then every now and then he'll, you know, look at the comments and, and riff off of them. So people build up to like, he, he'll announce that he's going on and then wait a little while and say hello to some people. Then once a bunch of people are in the room, then he starts talking.

Speaker 2:          01:40:13       Yeah, and I, I just, I find A. I find that so interesting because that is the future of conversation. It's looking at the patterns, it's looking at what people are trying to do with a thing and then you build technology around it and that becomes. That becomes the next big thing and we just have to. We have to hone our power of observation in our power of like connecting the dots and looking at all the patterns and what people are. It's what's the question behind the question? What's, what's the statement behind the statement that they're making and if we can get good at understanding some of those fundamental central things, then we've reached, we've, we've at least created the probability that most people in the world will find it useful and find valuable. Joey Diaz

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       is the other person that uses periscope better than anybody alive, but he just gets it. He just gets baked. That just gives you a morning. He call it morning bond. Morning joint. The morning joint. Yeah. He'll, he'll smoke a joint or smoke a bowl in the morning and then just sort of let everybody know, do you in. Sometimes mine

Speaker 2:          01:41:12       doing something in sync with one, with, with more people's interesting. Like, uh, we've um, we've had some folks who are interested in doing meditations through periscope. Oh, that's a great idea. You can't. I mean if you, if you looked at, at the surface level, I can't imagine anything more boring than like watching someone meditate, but if you're actually meditating with them, there's something powerful about it and like what can we do to improve that experience?

Speaker 1:          01:41:37       What about people using it for group workouts? Is anyone doing that?

Speaker 2:          01:41:41       I'm sure it's happened and I haven't seen it personally, but I'm sure it's happening. How much more people do you have on twitter than periscope? A lot. A lot. A lot. It's a, it's one of those things that I personally just have a lot of conviction around and I have a lot of belief in the format in. I know every now and then we don't have instant hits. It just requires a lot of patients and we need to really learn what it wants to be in the. Sometimes that takes time and you know, I think oftentimes I've certainly done this. We, uh, you know, we shut down, we shut down things a little bit too early and we did this at square. Like we had this amazing technology and app I love cold a square wallet and it allowed you to um, you know, you link your credit card and you have all these merchants around you here in La and you could walk up to a coffee merchant and as you walked up, your name would pop up on the register.

Speaker 2:          01:42:38       So you could say like, I want a Cappuccino, put it on Jack and it just automatically charge your card. And they would only happen if you were with him like two feet. We're using Bluetooth and geolocation would not. But we, uh, we, we had it for about three years and it, it, it just didn't take off and we shut it down. And I kinda regret doing that. But it also paved the way for another thing that I didn't want to give up on. And that was, that was the cash app, like for four years. Uh, it was just a slog, like a lot of people in the company wanted to shut down the thing. They saw it as something that wasn't successful. And you know, recently the team reached number one in the, in the APP store in the United States. Like we, we, we were all, we were against all these incumbents like Venmo and paypal and, and uh, it finally clicked and it's just because we had the patients and the conviction render our belief.

Speaker 1:          01:43:33       Yeah, it's a great app too. And the ethics behind it are really fantastic too. We're really thankful for the cash app, especially my friend Justin wren, and it's fight for the forgotten charity that every time you use the code word Joe Rogan all one word, it all goes. Where matched $5 goes to, to that they've built two to the pygmies in the Congo and they've raised thousands of dollars in building more wells right now. It's really, really cool. Yeah, we're really, really happy about that. Yeah. Yeah, I love it. I think it's um, it's a great way to save money too. I mean when you can save 10 percent at whole foods, I mean that's real.

Speaker 2:          01:44:06       Well, if the other thing is like to the population that we serve typically are underserved by banks or unbanked entirely. We are their bank account, but more importantly they don't have access to things like rewards. You don't get rewards on a typical debit card or credit card. So like just you know, going to your favorite place and getting an instant 10 percent off or whatever it is, is out of reach for most people because the financial institutions don't enable that and they won't even enable them to get in the door, in the front, in the first place. Well, if people are listening,

Speaker 1:          01:44:39       is this on youtube, you don't know what the fuck we're talking about. The cash APP has a thing called a cash card or a debit card that you get with it and there's a thing called boosts and with boosts, all you do is pick a boost in the APP and then use your cash card as a debit card and you get these automatic discounts and they're real discounts. Yep. And interest for folks with bad credit. There's no credit check. You can direct deposit your paycheck right into the app and the fact that you guys do do things like support fight for the forgotten and you're supporting UFC fighter ray borg son. He's got some serious medical bills.

Speaker 2:          01:45:11       No, it's really, really cool. Yeah. Yeah. I'm really. I'm really proud of that. I'm really proud of the team. It's A. It's a very small team, but they're doing some big things

Speaker 1:          01:45:17       well. I hear a lot of good things about it too. I've, I've, I've run into people on the street that tells me they use it in the very happy about it, so it's nice to see, again, a, an emerging technology that's profitable but yet also has a really good at it. Really good set of ethics. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have, don't be evil in cash. Maybe we should. Maybe we should take it.

Speaker 2:          01:45:37       So when, uh, one of our, one of our like equivalent operating principles within cash and square is like under like how do we understand someone's struggle? Like how do we understand like how do we have the empathy for what they're struggling with and like when it comes to finance, they're struggling with a lot. Yeah. Typically they're struggling with a ton. What was the,

Speaker 1:          01:45:58       the thought process with. I mean, one of the things that's kind of cool about the cash app is that you can buy and sell bitcoin with it. Are you going, are you guys going to consider other forms of crypto currency as well?

Speaker 2:          01:46:08       Not right now. I, so back to the Internet. I believe the Internet will have a native currency really. They don't have a native currency and I don't know if it's bitcoin and I think it will because just given all the tests it's been through and the principles behind it, how it was created and um, you know, it's, it was something that was born on the Internet that was developed on the Internet that it was tested on it. It is of the Internet and the reason we, um, you know, we enabled the purchasing of bitcoin within, within the cash APP is one we want to learn about the technology and we wanted to put ourselves out there and take some risks. Were the first publicly traded company to actually it as a service where the first publicly traded company to talk to the sec about the coin in what that, what that means.

Speaker 2:          01:46:55       And it made us uncomfortable. We had to, we had to like really understand what was going on and, and that was critical and important. And then the second thing is that we, you know, we would, we would love to see something become a global currency. It did, it enables more access. It, it allows us to serve more people. It allows us to move much faster around the world. And um, we, uh, we, we thought we were going to start with how you can use it transactionally, but we noticed that people were treating it more like an asset, like a, like a virtual gold, and we wanted to, um, we want to just to make that easy, like I'm just the simplest way to buy and sell bitcoin. But we also knew that it had to come with a lot of education, had to come with constraint because, you know, two years ago people did some really unhealthy things about, you know, purchasing bitcoin.

Speaker 2:          01:47:55       They maxed out their credit cards and um, put all their life savings into bitcoin. So we, we developed some severity, simple restrictions and constraints like you can, you can't buy bitcoin on the cash app with a credit card. You have to, it has to be the money you actually have in it. And we look for day trading, which we, uh, we discourage and shut down like that. That's not what we're trying to build. That's not what we're trying to optimize for. We made a children's book explaining what Bitcoin is and where it came from and how people use it and where it might be going. So we really tried to take on the role of education and, and, and to have some like very simple healthy constraints that allowed to be allowed people to consider what their actions are in the space.

Speaker 1:          01:48:41       Now when you have something like the cash app, which is a, it's very much a disruptive technology in terms of like decentralization of, of banks and, and, and currency and you know, to have it where everything is going right at your direct depositing a paycheck right in the app if you so choose. And then you could also buy bitcoin, which is another disruptive technology mean that this is another step towards this sort of new way of doing things. No. And is there pushback from, from any companies or is there.

Speaker 2:          01:49:17       Oh yeah, yeah. I mean like you just look at some of the major banks and their consideration around bitcoin. They all love blockchain because of the efficiencies that can create for their business and potentially new business lines. But, um, you know, I think there is a explain blockchain to people for people who don't know what we're talking about. Blockchain is a distributed ledger and what that means is that, um, it's basically a distributed database where, you know, the, the source of truth can be verified at any point around the network and you can, you know, um, this, this annotation around how content or how around money like traveled. Um, so you don't have to go to an institution. So the records, yeah, there's no centralized check, there's no centralized control over it. Um, and I think that is a threatening. It's, it's, it's certainly threatening, um, to certain services behind banks and financial institutions.

Speaker 2:          01:50:09       It's threatening to some governments as well. Um, so I, I just look at this and like how do we embrace this technology, not react to it in a more from a threat standpoint, but like what does it enable us to do and where does our value shift? And that's what we should be talking about right now is like how our value shifts. And there's always really strong answers to that question. But if you're not willing to ask the question the first place, you will become irrelevant because technology will just continue to march on and make you irrelevant and it's the people that like are, are, you know, growing up with this technology are born with the technology only knowing that technology or are asking the tough questions of ourselves that are going to be super disruptive to their business and they're, they're thinking about right now and they're and they're taking actions and you know, we're doing, we're doing that at square and we're doing that at twitter and like that to me represents longevity.

Speaker 2:          01:51:03       That represents our ability to, to thrive and we, we got to push ourselves going to make ourselves uncomfortable and we got to disrupt what we held sacred and what we think is success at it because otherwise it's not going to be bigger than what we have today. Yeah. I couldn't agree more. And I think that cryptocurrency to me represents one of the more interesting discussions on the Internet. What is money and why are we agreeing that it's these pieces of paper that the Federal Reserve prints out. Totally. It's, it's a fascinating time in technology because like that, that to me was one of the, one of the last big, um, centralized natch, a nationalized instruments is his currency is money and when you think about the internet as a, as a, as a country, as a market, as a nation, it's going to have its own currency and, but what's interesting about the internet as a nation, it's the whole world.

Speaker 2:          01:52:02       It is the whole world. So the world gets one currency, it gets, it's one thing to communicate in and that, to me it's just so freeing and so exciting. Yeah, I, I'm very excited by it and I'm also very excited that the fact that it's only been around for such a short period of time, but yeah, 10 years and it's become a part of the global conversation, good brand. I also think that it's going to open up the door to potential universal languages and I think this is, this is. Yeah. Yeah. That excites me a lot about twitter as like how do we like it if we want to get the world into a conversation into a, not a single conversation, but at least being able to see that global conversation, like we gotta work on technologies that like instantly translate. Yeah, we got to work on technologies that I can speak as I'm speaking right now in, in real time. People are hearing it in their context and their language and their dialect. That is amazing. That is so exciting. And like just how that evolves. Um, and uh, how it, how it impacts not just communication like this, but music. Uh, and just like, you know, how hip hop and rap and you know, just, it just, it, it's, it's amazing to think about where that, where that can go and where that can take us. Yeah. And I think

Speaker 1:          01:53:15       you and I are extremely fortunate to be alive right now during this time because I think it's one of the strangest and most unique times in human history. Totally. I don't think there's ever been a time where things have changed so radically so quickly.

Speaker 2:          01:53:27       Totally. Yeah. And I, I feel, you know, we, um, we're, we're, we're just, we're, we're able through technologies like twitter to at least see and acknowledge some of the issues that we're still facing and we're probably in the dark before and I think that's so critical to making any sort of improvements for, for making any sort of evolution and a and for making it better for everyone on the planet. And I, you know, as, as uncomfortable as, as you know, sometimes twitter makes people feel, I think it is necessary to, to see those things and have conversations about them so that we can understand how we might move forward and how we might. I'm really good at the biggest problems facing us all and you know, there's some huge ones, some huge ones right now that if we don't have, if we don't talk about it, like it will drive us to extinction and like it will threaten our ability to, to be a planet to live on this planet. I agree.

Speaker 1:          01:54:37       Thank you. Thanks for everything, man. Thanks for being here. Thanks for doing what you're doing. Thanks for having the attitude that you have. I really, really appreciate it. Thank you. My pleasure. Bye everybody.

Speaker 3:          01:54:49       Thank you.
