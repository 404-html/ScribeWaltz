Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches, like going to a Korean restaurant. My one of my buddies is Roy Choi. I haven't talked to him forever, but we used to live next to, he did a, he's the chef and he out him on the podcast and uh, well he took us, he did a, he does the Kogi Taco truck. He's got him on the podcast. Yeah, no, no, you did 100% wrong. Nope. He, he came in with Eddie Wong. But Roy Choi is a very famous chef. One of the most famous famous chefs in La Right now. Not Episode was this type in Roikoi uh, Joe Rogan. I promise you. As I watched it and I was like, so he was with Eddie? Yeah. No, nope. He was, no, I'm a hundred percent certain. Well, I fight fight that. Google's right. Nope. I am 100% certain. Eddie Wong came in one time with the guy that was in that movie.

Speaker 1:          00:51          The interview. I'm, I'm going to go to the match on this one. I'm looking at it right now. I just spoke with it. And you're wrong. So Bert Kreischer is going deep and he's taking chances. Predictions. He's challenging young Jamie on the air boy choice. I think we got a little too high before the show. Rogue and honest with you. We got a little ridiculous Roy Choi. I did. I misspell it. Roy Choi, Joe Rogan experience with Brian Stann. Hmm. What? No, that's definitely not true. It says, it says Roy Choi. I promise you. Well, Brian, Stan was definitely by himself. Can Right? Can someone please just tweet the fucking answer to me cause I promised you I saw it and I would make these people do the work when you're not doing this. I'm not too far. I'm too fucked up to do the okay. But I promise you it was on in here one time.

Speaker 1:          01:45          I know he's wrong, but I'm like God damn he right. Roy Choi fucking Jamie. The Roy Choi created the TACO truck crane. Uh, he's good friends with Anthony Bourdain and uh, sorry, maybe you're spelling it wrong. Racist. Whoa. Dare you. How dare you cast upon him a moniker that cannot be shaken. So anyway, damn, I don't even know where if I was going with his point wines. It's getting hot in here. All sorts of different types of alcohol. We're probably out of wine, wine, young Jamie, Jamie's gonna find out. But I don't know where my point with this going. Oh he took, he took me and my wife to uh, he took me and my wife to um, uh, to Korea town to go eat Korean barbecue cause he wanted to teach us real Korean barbecue, like what they eat, not the kind that we believe it is.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Right. And it was interesting. We went in there and no one's spoken, no one, there were not only were there any white people, no one spoke English at work there. And so we actually were complete and total tourists in our own town and just sat and watched him order and, and he just was like, don't worry, I'll, and it was really fascinating experience. Would I want that place to ever go away? Never in a million fucking years. I want those places to last as long as son of a bitch. Champagne motherfucker brought out champagne. Damn. Isn't it? Is this cause you're wrong and Ma Fucka a birthday. Uh, but uh, but like I believe in that. I know, but I I, but then again, we're on the same liberal side of the fence because I am a, I've, maybe I'm a libertarian or whatever. I am. I'm a liberal. I'm a conservative liberal or conservative. Liberal. Yeah. What do you liberal about? Like gay rights, gay rights, all rights, all human rights, all female gay rights, transgender or you name it. I don't want you to feel like shit. If I can help that, that's my job as a comic. My only goal is to make people laugh. Why would I ever want anyone to feel bad about their day? That's not my emo. Beautiful. And what do you conservative about? Um, like blacks?

Speaker 2:          03:45          No,

Speaker 1:          03:50          no, the right to tell that joke to you. Yes. Good. That's what I'm conservative about. Is that conservative anymore? Yes, it is because it's still conservative. Is Conservative value to be able to express yourself in a way that it'd be offensive. Did you see that the recent ruling, young Jamie pulled this up? It's kind of interesting. The court ruled against this idea that uh, there should be laws against, what can I calm down? Brighton. I'm about to release the crackin. He's going to open this cork and Brian is terrified. Like he's never been to the gun range. I had one of those hit me in the eye before. Oh, there you are partying with the wrong people. Sign it into that wine and make a fine rosie Zinfandel or some shit. A wine cooler. A bit. That's like a watermelon lime cooler. Barlow, James Bartles and jaymes strawberry, right? Strawberry. I'm not drinking. Double it up. Mother drink during the day. It doesn't take one of the gin. Hey, whoa, listen. Okay. What I'm going to hammered right now that we're all hammered. We're all stone too. You just said you went to take it on the Chin after giving a story about a man massaging somebody that I'm really like down in the Internet, not backing me up with his roy toy thing and I started right. It looks like, but I'm pretty sure he's right. He's not right,

Speaker 2:          05:09          right. Almost all the time.

Speaker 1:          05:11          Is that racist? Is Not Racist. It's just a gong. Can we get away with a Gong for anybody gets mad? David Cho or that you're thinking of? No, it's Roy Choi. I want to fucking call him. God has no nothing. It's a void choice. Sorry, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm looking at all the Eddie Wong episodes when he was in here. He wasn't in here sweetie. It's okay. Jamie. I'm sorry. I mean this is the only place I've worked here. I was in this building and I pretty much remember every single one. It would have to be super old school, like to the point where I don't remember it anymore. Last time you were on the show, we drove home together or the time before and you talked about your friend. So it must have been within the last three months then I would, I only know this cause he's done the, he's been done for Dane tumor, something going on here.

Speaker 1:          06:00          He's telling me here, I'm sorry. Yeah, I hydrated. He, I've, he's done bourdain show and he's done your podcast and he'd do neither for me. So I remember going like, like a per day and I get it. Why wouldn't you go on with Bourdain? One of the greatest people on television for chefs, but I was like podcast wise, like I was like, I was like, and I get why you do joe, but like throw me a bone Roy. Like we were, he's a good guy. He's a great guy. But his, uh, um, no, I don't want to get removed from the podcast. Eddie Wong and Shane Smith. I guarantee let's, maybe you hold on. No, no, no, no. Go to the video. Go to the video and see if there's another Asian guy. Was there another Asian guy in here with them? Their lunch time there was, there was a, it was the dude from a party. He was from that show. The show off. Was it?

Speaker 1:          06:46          What was it? Off the boat. Fresh off the boat I was spending, now I know what I'm doing tonight. It's no big deal, dude. He can be wrong. I think you're wrong. Attach your whole life to this. It's just too hard to win and every phone life to let some certain losses, they're going to come your way and you've got to regroup and you've got to pick up the paces, paces, paces, pick up the pieces and move on with your life for Christ or bigger fan of your podcast and you are of your podcasts. I watch all of them. Sharon, how could you ever say that? That Joe Rogan's, he's not saying anything either. So David Choe found it. I don't even think anybody named Roy has been on the podcast. Came on with David Show. Yup, he did. He's right here. David was been on a few times, maybe came to one of the ice house chronicles. Was it a nice house? Chronical? Nope. I'm going through, this was David's show. I did David show once. That's it. It was five 92 with David. She was the one episode I wasn't here. Oh Shit. Could have been the one episode, but Jamie was on five 63 that can't be that dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

Speaker 1:          07:52          What gave it shows podcasts that when Joe Rogan was on that podcast could have been. I think that's, it makes more sense. Number five 92 I have a, this is horrible podcasting and no, it's not. I have a hard time believing when we've actually done 750 podcasts. I was all five 90 27697006969 bro. You've done 769 podcasts. Indeed preposterous. It's great man. I like what you did and I don't know, I think I may have told you this one thing fucked up. I'm, I'm very, uh, I'm envious in a sense of what you've done and only, I only had that I could not do it. Begin it now. What you did is you kind of took, you kind of took the renaissance to yourself and you allowed people that think differently than you to come to you and talk to you and you got to kind of soak in the information like a sponge as a stand up man.

Speaker 1:          08:42          That is like, that's the fucking, that's what we all should be doing. Instead of just sitting around and going, what does this guy think about airplanes? What is it? You know what I mean? You really kind of broadened the spectrum of what you want to talk about on stage. And I remember hearing Chris rock say that he got invited to Cornell Wallace's house for Sunday dinners and right before he did his most monumental hour and he was like, you know, it was really cool. I didn't say anything. I just would sit and listen to all these great Glenn Wallace or West Cornell West, my dad, Hey Bert Roy troy was an episode of getting Doug with high with Horatio's sands. Uh, Kuroshio and me have often been confused.

Speaker 1:          09:24          There's no way I might think of Doug with the high. Yes, yes you are. Oh, are you serious? Yo, it happens. Let it go. Just embrace the loss. Take it on the Chin and move forward. Soldier on, sir. It's no big deal. Burt wanted minute. Look at them. Very competitive, very competitive. Getting Doug with high. You know what? You hit. Hit debunked this. Are you ready for me to debunk a scientist? Hoping you can do it. Here we go. Mike. Drop moment. Dear scientist who spent her whole life figuring this out, I just shut you down so I built a time trouble. Me and Brian are time travel consists of a bottle of champagne, a lighter and a joint. Right? I'm just saying simple, simpler time machine. Yeah. Stops or join in on this. Can I handle this one on my own? So I'm so let's play.

Speaker 1:          10:16          I'm just saying simple mechanics. Let's pretend that that's the time machine, right? We got it. All right. We invent a time machine. God, Oh my God, we right now we can travel back to that moment three days ago. We can try to travel back to this moment or three days to know. I can say to Brian, hey, our time machine really just consists of a bottle of champagne, a joint and lighter. Go to f, let's fucking send you back. You know the three things. Bill one then come back to me. Now your idea, she gets together with my chipolte lay person. They have sex and have a baby. That makes no sense you guys. There's no time machine never going to be built because Donald Trump is president and dogs living together. We're a simulation program. Time machine doesn't matter. Burt's ideas back to the future. Three basically. Is that what it is, Jamie? Jamie shutting your shit down. Stuck what they do to your, you're interrupting your Kettle Bell Workout on a stop shutting down. Oh fuck. Okay.
