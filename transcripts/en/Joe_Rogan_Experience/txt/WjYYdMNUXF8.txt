Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Four, three, two,

Speaker 1:          00:00:07       all the way from Tucson, Arizona. Dr. Weil, how are you sir? I am good. Thanks for doing this man. I appreciate it. Pleasure. You come highly recommended by many human beings that I know well. I'm glad to hear it. How do you. How do you get such a fine reputation? Well, I've been doing the same things for a long time. Just putting one foot ahead of the other and saying what I know to be true and push and Macho Macho. Who doesn't like Matcha tea? This is your stuff. Yeah, but you know, a lot of people know, have only tasted really bad much enlighten me what's know? It's powdered tea and it's very, very finely powdered and it's very labor intensive to prepare and it's got such a huge surface area that it oxidizes very quickly. So if it's not properly packed and stored, it loses its brilliant green color.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       It turns yellow, green or gray green. It gets bitter and loses its taste. And I got to say, most of the macho that I see served in this country is of that sort. And many people have never had the good stuff. What's the benefits of Macho? I know there's. First of all it's been. It's beautiful. I mean I've never seen a green color like that. It's just amazing. And the flavors are amazing, but it's the only preparation of tea in which the whole leaf is consumed and it. It's grown under special conditions. The leaves are shaded a deep shade for the last three weeks before harvest. So the in response to that, the leaves produce more chlorophyll, more antioxidants, more the good stuff. So it's got a much more of the things that you want. And this has like a pop top, like pringles. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       Is that so the marches and it's got to stay fresh and fun and you want to keep it in the freezer and freezer and you can sift it so it doesn't form lumps. And then you whisk it with that traditional bamboo whisk or you buy a little electric whisker and you can whisk it in hot water or cold water. And it's very yummy. And w what, what does it do for you? Like, what's the good. Well you've got, it's got caffeine of course, so you get stimulated by it, but it's also got [inaudible], which is this relax and compound that modifies the effect of caffeine and produces a state of relaxed alertness so it doesn't have the jangling effective coffee. And uh, you're getting all of these antioxidant benefits that are well documented in tea. Anyway. I love it. It's a great thing. Anytime you get one of these little whisks, it's cool.

Speaker 1:          00:02:20       It's like a real bamboo made from one piece of bamboo. It's a miracle of a Japanese craftsmanship. It's beautiful and it's beautiful. So, um, how often do you drink this stuff? I have a bowl of it every morning and yeah. And sometimes I have a glass of iced macho later in the day, especially in warm weather. You just so much a fiend. I love it. It's a good thing. I first tasted it when I was 17. I was an exchange student in Japan. Uh, 19, 59. I lived with a family outside of Tokyo. We had no language and come and on the second night I was there, the mother took me next door to her neighbors who practice tea ceremony and they did this thing for me and I was fascinated by that whisk and the color of the Macho and I thought it was great.

Speaker 1:          00:02:59       You know, I never thought I'd be able to get it over here. Yeah. Well, so you, you import this stuff yourself. Was that. I started a company called Mochi, Kaare. We've got the URL [inaudible] dot com and I went to Japan to Eg, which is a little town outside of Kyoto, which is the center of the best tea production in Japan. And I sourced really good macho, you know, there are many grades and launch of the most, the highest are too expensive to use for everyday use. They're really phenomenal. Alex, like truffles are really expensive so I've tried to find the best Macia that is affordable and make it available to people here. So like the highest level stuff. How much would it cost for a cup of tea? Hard to estimate for a cop, you know, it possibly. There's a preparation called thick tea in Japan where they use three times the amount of powder and probably one bowl of that stuff, which is shared by several people.

Speaker 1:          00:03:51       I don't know. It could be a $100 a bowl. Whoa. Really? Yeah. Why, why did it catch on in Japan like that? It's always been, you know, it has been in Japan for a very long time. And, and uh, this powdered tea preparation was originally taken up by Zen monks, uh, to help them stay awake during long hours in meditation. It was also associated with a Samurai and became the tea ceremony developed around that. Is there anything that is similar to it is like your Vermont Tay or Guarana or any other time? These are all, they're all caffeine plants, but in my experience, t I think, and it's primarily because of that Elle fanning content of the effect is mellower of caffeine. So you get stimulated, you get alert, but it doesn't have the jangling effective a lot of these other caffeine beverages. Do you drink regular coffee as well?

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       No, I've never drunk coffee. Wow. I think I was turned off because my parents, when I was growing up, drank really strong black coffee with no sugar cream and I couldn't imagine why people would savages and those people. There were different people. Did you grow up in a northern climate? I grew up in Philadelphia. When it's cold outside people they drink that black coffee makes you angry. Yeah. Dark black, burnt coffee. I like bright green, shining Russia. Isn't it interesting that things that are good for you? Many things that are good for you, like bell peppers or something like that. They have a beautiful color to, well, you know, all these, uh, the health benefits of fruits and vegetables. A lot of them have to do with these pigments and the pigments the plants produce, they're part of their own defensive system and they do good things in us. And one piece of advice that I often give people is you should try to eat across the color spectrum and every day about what did you eat today that was red? What was purple, what was green, what was right. All of these have different benefits. Is that a scientific perspective? Absolutely. Yeah. These are categories of phytochemicals are protective, phyto nutrients and a lot of them are these pigments that give a fruits and vegetables that are bright colors. Do you think that people

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       should very those colors and in a given day or. I think as as much as you can across any day, try to eat across the color spectrum. That's a good thing to aim for. Okay. So just just get as many of them as in as you can. Yeah. Yeah. So do you take this approach with fruits, with all sorts of different things? Yeah, brightly colored stuff is good. Do you eat meat or fish and vegetables? Just fish and vegetables now when you did. One of the things I'm super concerned with and I've been more concerned with the more pay attention to it as sustainability when it comes to fish. Absolutely. It seems like especially ocean fish, we're human beings are just terrible monsters. You know, there's a famous oceanographer in this country, Sylvia Earl, who was the woman that held a record for the deep dive and she came up to me at a meeting once and pleaded with me not to recommend that people eat fish.

Speaker 2:          00:06:47       He said there just aren't going to be any in the future and that's probably true. Probably the future is going to be farmed fish and that can be done in a responsible way. You can get the good guides, one is put out by the Monterey Aquarium. You can get a wallet card that lists that lists fish and shellfish and rates them both by toxicity and sustainability. And that's a good guide to follow. Yeah. Um, mollusks mollusks I eat, I eat, I like oysters and scallops. I eat them. What is, what has led you to not eat chicken or fish or beef? It's been a long time. And uh, let's see. I was, I think 28 and I was interested in Yoga and people that I knew who were doing yoga had become vegetarian and I saw friends of mine that had become vegetarian. I thought, well, I'll just try it for a little while and it agreed with me, I didn't eat fish for a number of years and I found that made the international travel very difficult, especially to Japan.

Speaker 2:          00:07:48       And, and then I was reading about all the research on good stuff and fishing. I started eating fish and that way of eating Greens with me real well. Yeah. Um, it is a thing that agree with you thing, right? It really dependent upon the person's very individually. So, you know, it's hard to give blanket rules except I have no problem telling people to stay away from refined, processed and manufactured food. That's the bad stuff. Yeah. That's a really good, clear thing that everybody can kind of apply in their life. But as far as like, what is gonna work for you, there's a lot of trial and error involved isn't absolutely. You got to do experiments, pay attention, see what works for you. Yeah. Now you practice. What would you, how would you call it? Integrative, integrative medicine? How would you define that? Well, it's medicine of the future and uh, you know, the short answer and the future short answer is that's the intelligent combination of conventional and alternative medicine, but really it's, it's a system that focuses on the body's ability to heal itself that looks at people as whole persons, not just physical bodies, uh, that takes account of all aspects of lifestyle and understanding health and illness, a values the practitioner, patient relationship and makes use of all therapies no matter where they come

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       from that show, reasonable evidence of efficacy and are not going to hurt people. So I am absolutely convinced this is the way out of the healthcare crisis. I've been training doctors and other health professionals in it for many years now. Now, when you say the body's ability to heal itself, how would you accentuate that with this to me is the thing that's most missing from medical education? Uh, I, I, I think the only time I heard the word healing used in medical school was in the, in wound healing, which in my first year course in histology, to me the most marvelous thing about our bodies is that they have the capacity to heal themselves. You'd get a cut, you can watch it heal, and that happens throughout the body. Knew the DNA molecule. This is just a big molecule on the border of life and non life.

Speaker 1:          00:09:41       It has within it the ability to know in quotes when it's been injured, have a cosmic ray, knocks a part of it out. Instantly it begins to manufacture, repair enzymes that, that duplicate the missing piece and paste it in and you can see that same thing at any level of biological organization. And to me, that's where good medicine should start, that the body has within them the ability to maintain equilibrium, heal itself. Now knowing that the body has disability of what? What do you do to accentuate that? Well, if I, when I listened to a patient and hear their story at the back of my mind, I'm thinking, why is healing not happening here, but what can I do from outside that can facilitate that? I can't put it into somebody, but I can help it along by either supplying energy, missing materials, remove obstacles to it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:28       You know, like you have a wound that doesn't heal. Maybe there's a foreign body in it. You remove that heals now. Um, when you have people that come to that have issues like saved, someone comes to and they have a back issue. Yeah. Got a little bit of lower back pain. Do you approach that from a, in terms of like how they're eating, how they're living their lifestyle? First I would question them about lifestyle for sure. But, uh, you know, I'm a great follower of a, a man who died recently named John Sarno who isn't, you know, veterans work. Sure. Uh, he has some great books, mind over back pain, healing back pain. And his main belief, which I totally agree with, is that the vast majority of back pain is muscle spasm, which originates in the mind and it may localize that an area of physical injury, but the injury is not the cause of it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:16       You can live with a slipped disc and have no pain. Uh, you look at x rays it defined slip though. What does that mean, bulging or herniated? That does not necessarily close pain. Uh, and unless there's associated neurological symptoms, you don't want to do anything about that. It's unless it's pressing on. Exactly right now I'm John Sarno. His idea was that it's a lot of stress and anxiety and a lot of different psychological factors that I'm sure he was some kind of incredible healer. He required the people who came to him come to to evening lectures that he gave. That's all many people who did that lost their back pain forever, just listening to him. So other people have had that happen. Just reading his book, I've read a little bit of it's, you know, I've had like legitimate injuries. So whenever I hear someone say, Oh, it's all in your head, it's not all in your head, it's in your head and your mind, your box in your head and your muscles, and then the problem of muscle spasm, which shuts off blood supply and it's a vicious cycle that that'll localize at an area you've had physical injury, but the pain is not coming from the injury.

Speaker 1:          00:12:25       It's coming from muscle spasm and that's controlled by a greatly influenced by the mind. So when you, when your back is like seizes up, that is a muscle spasm and it's incredibly painful and it's located in the area of the injury. So it doesn't confuse you into thinking it's the injury that's causing you pain. What leads people into getting physical interventions that may not be necessary? Yeah, I'm a big believer in waiting, especially with spinal stuff. Solutely absolutely always want to fuse you and cut you. And if you look at. Here's another interesting thing. You can look at x rays of people's spines that looks so horrible. You can't imagine that they can move and they have no nothing, no symptoms. And you can look at other x-rays that looked perfect and people are disabled by pain. So there's a very low correlation between physical findings and subjective experience.

Speaker 1:          00:13:16       Now, what is Sarno recommend? I never really recommends going about your business. Go nobody even ignoring it, going about your business and if possible, try to figure out what, what message you know, your mind descending down there. But basically it's a reassurance that it'll go away on its own. So when he does these lectures and he has people cures him of it is just, he just reassuring them that everything's going to in this process of how he calls the tension Myositis Syndrome. And he explains the mechanism of how it works. One friend of mine, he was in his late twenties, uh, played basketball, had a very serious herniated discs. He was within hours of having the real logical surgery, spinal surgery. And I yelled at him to read this book and CSR News in New York. And he said, I don't believe any of. That's all bullshit. And I said, go, go see him.

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       So he went the same. Oh, it went through the evening lectures. Thought this was nonsense, uh, went home, was having dinner and realized his back pain was gone, never had surgery. She's really know Scott to be something to that, right? There's, there's something to the placebo effect. So if there, if, if that is a real thing, if you can convince your body that it's got the medicine that it needs and it starts to heal even though there's no medicine, there's got to be something that is working against you as well with the wrong mindset. It's funny to me to hear people rediscovering the placebo effect. Now, I wrote a book in 1983 called health and healing and had two chapters in there. One Placebos. And what I wrote is that the greatest problem is that we know when we talk about placebos, it's in phrases like, how do you know that's not just a placebo effect.

Speaker 1:          00:14:53       The most interesting word there is just, or we have to rule out the placebo effect. We shouldn't be rolling it in, man. That's the meat of medicine. That's pure healing from within mediated by belief on mixed up with the direct effects of treatment. That's what you want to make happen more the time. It just is a mind fuck for a lot of people because they're like, how am I trick myself into getting better? Why can't I just do it? Because that must have something to do with the structure of the brain that the part of the brain in which our will is isn't, doesn't connect directly to the machinery of the body to the autonomic nervous system. So you have to find some way of getting around that. One way is to project belief onto something external and then let it work for you. Yeah, but that's so strange that the mind works that way.

Speaker 1:          00:15:36       It would seem like, wouldn't it be an evolutionary advantage? Just have it at access, you know, like. Sure. That'd be nice, but that's the same thing. You know, it's a similar problem to why can't you just get high without taking a drug the highest in your brain, not in the drug. The drug is a trigger that releases it. Why can't we just sit down and say, well, I'm going to be high for the next 10 minutes. So the same thing, we don't have access to those controls to. It just seems like that one though. Healing getting better. That one seems like it's something that we should as a culture concentrate on. Yeah, for sure. What we really concentrate on is actual medicine, but one way to concentrate that is by giving people greater confidence in their body's ability to do that. And doctors have great power to do that because patients project a lot of belief on them.

Speaker 1:          00:16:20       I've had many patients over the years who said that the most important thing I did for them was that I was the only doctor who told them they could get better. I mean, astonishing. Yeah. Is it because doctors had just seen too many patients and they're overwhelmed and they got legal bills and they have. I think some. I've thought about this a lot and there's also the negative side of this. I've seen what a, there's something called medical hexing in which Dr say things that actually interfere with healing or caused people to get worse. And I think a lot of this is done unconsciously. Uh, so here's one of my thoughts in their training. Um, Dr, see a very skewed sample of sick people. They see very sick people in hospitals and in that group, healing is less likely to happen, but if you look at the total spectrum of illness, the vast majority of things get better on their own.

Speaker 1:          00:17:10       So I think observing in yourself for wound healing is a good one to start with, to get greater confidence in your body's ability to do things that's really valuable. So this obviously you're not talking about catastrophic injuries, you just talking about general wellness. I think even in the case of a catastrophic injury, this stuff operates. I worked a lot with hypnotherapists over the years and one of the, one of my colleagues, uh, did a lot of work in training paramedics to be really careful about what you say around unconscious people who've been massively injured. Uh, you know, when the, if a, if a paramedic takes an automobile accident victim and they're putting them in, says this one's a corner. That is a bad thing. You know the unconscious mind on and on the other hand you say something opposite to a person. You can see cases where you can stop bleeding in unconscious people severely injured just by giving them suggestions.

Speaker 1:          00:18:05       Whoa. Yeah. So when you're saying someone's a goner, you trigger stress. Are you trigger helplessness? Like what happened? A medically trained person tell you that you're not going to live. That's a. that's a curse. Yeah. That's saying well hex. How strange is it that sometimes your life is hanging on the border of you believing you're going to be okay and you believe in you're not going to be. Oh, so you want to be very careful about, you know whose hands you place yourself in. Yes. Never want to stay in treatment with a doctor who thinks she can't get better. A negative doctor. Well, doctors are just like every other occupation. There's people that are really good at it and it really concentrated and focused and there's people that are half ass. Well the ones I trained through our University of Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine get it. You know, we're putting out.

Speaker 1:          00:18:51       We've graduated about 1600 physicians now from very intensive training there in practice all over the country. Teaching other people's is a good thing now. When you say integrative medicine, when they're in practice, are they essentially general practitioners? We've trained people from all specialties and specialty you can name. We've trained them, so orthopedic surgeons and neurologists, dermatologists, anything you could ever do and so you try to tend to look at them. We teach them all the things they didn't get in medical school, nutrition, mind, body interactions, strengths and weaknesses of alternative medicine, herbal medicine, all that like say someone comes to you and maybe they have a bad case of psoriasis, autoimmune issue like that. Prime prime target for mind body medicine for traditional Chinese medicine, which often works well and in that dietary change, but people on an anti inflammatory diet, use of natural products that reduce inflammation, so there's a wide range of things to choose from and this does not reject conventional treatment.

Speaker 1:          00:19:47       You know, we may use conventional medication, but if you do, I recommend using the lowest dose of the least potent agent. Start off with that and you can ramp up if you need to. Well, a lot of people and me, I'm definitely guilty of this. They hear terms like holistic or eastern medicine or Chinese medicine to go bullshit. Right? Well I have a good bullshit detector too and so I'm really careful about what I, you know, accept and what I know. Um, what, what do you not buy into? Like when you see your bullshit detector, like what were you. I'll give you an example. I've, you know, I've, I'm not, I can't see any basis for crystal healing. Crystal my pocket right now. Exactly. Alright. Well, too bad. How about the colonic irrigation people tell you, tell you that they see a watermelon seeds coming out and you haven't eaten a watermelon in months. That's bullshit. The, the lining of the Gi track sloughed off and is regenerated every 24 hours. There's no way that things can get

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       encrusted there. Yeah, that's a weird one. The colonic thing, because your body has all this natural bacteria that you're supposed to keep in there. Right? Not only keeping there, we're finding out that that's like more and more really important determinant of everything, of general health, of mental health to. Fascinating. Yeah. Whose idea was it to start doing those colonics? That muscular way back. That's kind of like a wacky idea. Pumps water up there. See what's up. Yeah. And you have to stand there when it gets it. It's addictive too. I see people get addicted to this. Yes. Yeah. So out of all the things I won't go further into. My wife had it done once and she was describing it to me. I'm like, yeah, I'm going to pass some lady's looking at the two and telling you what's going on in their life. At some point the is like looking at your shit.

Speaker 2:          00:21:33       Right? It started as early as 1500 BC evers, pop piracy in ancient Egyptian medical document described the many benefits of colon cleansing in ancient times. The practice of cleansing the colon was administered in a river by using a hollow reed to induce water to flow into the rectum. We don't want to drink downstream of that. Yeah. And, and, uh, you know, there's no need to do this. What you want to do is make sure that things are going through in the right direction regularly and it cleans itself. That's how it's supposed to do it, right? Yeah. Yeah. Another big one. I hear all these people that talk about detox, detoxification and sell all these products. The body has many natural methods of purifying itself and getting rid of things with. The other one is through sweating. A one is through breathing, one is through urination, one is through colonic elimination.

Speaker 2:          00:22:26       Uh, the liver has an incredible capacity to detoxify. It can take, you know, you put something into your body, the liver within seconds of seeing a compound that has never seen before can begin making a specific enzyme to take that apart and get rid of it. Wow. And you can amputate half of the liver and it can regenerate within 36 hours. What's? Yes, livers amazing. Thirty six hours. Yeah. So I thought when you gave someone like half your liver, if there was like a liver transplant issue that took a long time. I know liberty can regenerate really quickly and there's sand. There's a natural product that you can take that most doctors don't learn about. Cold milk thistle, you've probably heard of that. That revs up liver metabolism, so you know these are all simple ways to increase, but the first rule of detoxification, I'm sure you can guess you stopped putting toxic things in, cut it off at the pass and let it let the body get purifies all. Yeah, well, what do you do when someone's a cigarette smoker? You tell them to set a date. The quit set a date. That's the most important thing because each attempt, it doesn't matter if you succeed, it's making the attempt to quit, goes into a reservoir of motivation. That one day will be fallen off. That it's easy, and this by the way, happens with heroin. Addicts, happens with cigarette

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       addicts. I've seen many people, lifelong cigarette addict struggled, gave it up, came back one day they wake up and they look at stain fingers or a dirty ash tray and they don't want to do it anymore and it's an easy. There's no struggle. Same thing with heroin addicts, so it has to do with motivation. You can't put that into another person in. All you can do is arrange circumstances that maybe it'll happen. So the most important thing is to help you to set a date to quit and it doesn't matter if they how long they stick, but you're saying there's actually some strength to be gained from failed attempts. Yes. It's making the attempt that you get credit for really interesting. Yeah. So the more like say if you're a drunk and you keep falling off the wagon, if you just keep making these attempts.

Speaker 1:          00:24:26       Yes. No really. So there's something ramps up in your mind that makes it more feasible for you to quit. Yes. And when it, when it happens, there's no struggle. It's not, it's not an issue, it just, you don't want to do it anymore. Now what do you do when people come to you and they're on antidepressants? Well, I have a book called spontaneous happiness, which is about emotional wellness, is a lot there about antidepressants. First of all, they don't work so well. You know that sometimes they work. Sometimes it's hard to distinguish them from placebos, you know, the popular ones, the Ssri, and now because they don't work so well, you know, what doctors do, they added one psychotic drug. Horrifying. These are for major mental illness. They're not things you just add on to make the antidepressant work better. We've talked about that one ad nauseum on this podcast because it turned out to be the most prescribed drug in America that I can't believe that.

Speaker 1:          00:25:21       That's just astounding. Well, the word is that 25 percent of women between 40 and 50 are on antidepressants in 10 percent of adults in the country. All right. Now here's another. That's a crazy number. Well, first of all, the pharmaceutical companies have done a great job of convincing people that ordinary states of sadness are problems of brain biochemistry, that you have to be treated with the drug. We're not supposed to be happier with them. Secondly, there's a big problem with a lot of the medications that we use in antidepressants are a good example. Most of the medications we use are counteractive. No, they oppose some process in the body. So when you do that, the body pushes back against it, that's called homeostasis. You know, an easy example you can relate to as if you have a stuffed up nose, you spray a drug in it that decongestant you miraculous, right? You can breeze and depending on which drug you use, two hours, four hours at lasts. But when it wears off, you have rebound congestion that's worse. If you use another dose of the drug, then very easy to slide into a Jamie, very easy to slide into a state of dependence on it. Same thing happens with many of these drugs, antidepressants, they raise serotonin levels, neuro junction, neural junctions. So what is the body going to do? If you force an increase in Serotonin, it's going to make less serotonin and drop serotonin

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       receptors. So if you stay on one of these for any length of time when you get off, you're gonna be in worse shape than you were to begin with. And this is now has a medical name. It's called tardive dysphoria, meaning lingering bad mood due to the drug. So the drug actually prolongs or intensifies the depression, you know, maybe. Okay, for very short term use of very severe depression, but these are not things you want to go on and stay on for a length of time. What's fascinating to me is when I talked to people that are on them that want to talk to you, like they're on some cancer medication or they're on something that cures polio, like they make it seem like you're insensitive to the possibility that there's other solutions and there are many other solutions. We have really good evidence for the antidepressant effect of physical activity.

Speaker 2:          00:27:30       Yes. Both to prevent and treat. We have very good evidence for supplemental fish oil for omega three fatty acids to prevent and cbds well and the microbiome looks like it's involved in our mental states as well. So you know, there's so many different ways of cbd for sure. So again, gets back to inflammation and it gets back to in an integrative approach and not just relying on a single thing like a pharmaceutical treatment. Yeah. I've talked to intelligent people that are on Ssri in one form or another and even ones that have struggled were on one for awhile and then it stopped working and then they tried another one and they're combining ones and they're on this weird sort of chemical rollercoaster and they reject any possible notion that there's other alternatives, especially when you bring up the exercise one, I bring up the exercise one, they go, oh, this fucking meathead exercise.

Speaker 2:          00:28:22       We just stopped and I'm like, I'm telling you. We did this thing with my friends called sober October and what we did is we no alcohol, no anything for the month of October, but also we did this fitness challenge and we got really carried away and we're all competing against each other with this heart rate APP, so we're working out three hours, four hours a day. It was crazy, but what was interesting about it to me was not just that your body sort of adapts when you force it to work out that many hours, but that your mood is phenomenal. I've felt so good. Yeah, and I was telling everybody if you could take what I like, I don't feel that good right now. I mean I felt great, but I don't feel as good as I did during October because I was working out four hours a day.

Speaker 2:          00:29:02       It was if you could get that in pill form, you would take it every day if there was no side effects because it literally removed anxiety. All the internal chatter, all the negative chatter, it was gone. Everything seemed amazing. True. And there are side effects of physical activity are great. You know, it revs up immune function, improves the gesture and sleep, all that you mentioned, the anxiety, the by far in a way, the most effective treatment I found for anxiety is simple, a simple breathing technique, regulating the breath. I've seen this work for the most extreme forms of panic disorder and the drugs that we use for anxiety or the worst. The benzodiazepines are highly addictive. Mess with your mind. Yeah. I have a good friend who has an issue with anxiety medication and he takes it all the time and when he does take it, apparently it has that rebound effect.

Speaker 2:          00:29:53       Exactly right. He gets horribly anxious. Well, these are handed out like candy and nobody warns people how addictive they are. It's a worse addiction than an opiate. Addiction. It xanax real well. I did not know that. Harder to get off of opioids. Wow. Now how do you feel about psychedelic interventions when it comes to addiction? It's like it seems that we're hearing more and more about that. I know you have a background in that as well. Well, we're especially hearing about the Boga and Ibogaine. This is the African a psychedelic and there are clinics and people using this. The claim great success. I don't have firsthand experience. I only know what I've heard and what I've talked to people, but sounds good and I think that most of the psychedelics are so nontoxic, so safe and in the right hands. I think there's many possibilities for good outcomes.

Speaker 2:          00:30:46       Yeah. They've also had some pretty good results with cigarette cessation. Yep. With not just a Bogo, but even with psilocybin. Yep. Apparently they had, they did a study where they show the difference between someone taking psilocybin to try to quit smoking cigarettes and some really large number of people. I think it was the neighborhood of 80 percent quit and then over the course of x amount of years they were still at 60 percent. So only 20 percent of those people would come back. That's great. But with other methods that the number was much smaller, somewhere in the range of 20 or 15 percent after six years, a lot of them just went back to it. What do you make of the microdosing phenomenon? I mean, this is pretty astounding to see this actual pussies you scared to jump all the way and get it all into one thing.

Speaker 2:          00:31:34       Scary man. Why you want to medicate every day? That's kind of how I feel. No, I'm just joking around. Uh, I think, um, I, I know people who have experienced some pretty severe benefits of it, especially people that weren't doing so good health wise and you know, we're just really kind of feeling down and depressed and all of a sudden outlook radically changed. Particularly psilocybin microdosing. I know a lot of people who are doing that. Yeah, same. I have a lot of hope that Oregon becomes the first state to. Sounds like it's close to legalize suicide. I've been, that'd be a big one. It would be gigantic. And I think once we realized that no one's dying and a lot of people are getting helped and a lot of people that are terminal are having some really amazing alleviation of anxiety and an understanding that it's going to be okay. And just, uh, I think between friends and just the, just the camaraderie, it sort of when you have these group experiences together, like there's some incredible benefits to that in terms of reinforcing

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       community and civilization the way we feel about each other. Now, aside from the psychological and emotional benefits, I think you would be fascinated by some of the things that I've observed and written about of real physical benefits of psychedelics. And I'll just tell you a couple. Uh, I, when I was in my late twenties, I did a lot of experiments, was in the seventies with lsd mostly with lsd. Um, I had a lifelong allergy to cats. If a cat got near me, my eyes would itch, my nose would run. If a cat licked me, I'd get highs were looking at me. So I always avoided them and didn't let him touch me. So I took lsd with a group of friends on a Spring Day because we get Virginia fabulous, you know, I was outside running around having a lot of fun. And in the middle of this the cat jumped into my lap and I had a moment of like trying to defend myself.

Speaker 1:          00:33:26       And then I thought, this is silly, you know, and I relaxed, played with the cat, had no allergic reaction and never did ever after the disappearance of an allergy that had been there all my life. What would it be? The physiological mechanism for some time? Well, then clearly that's a very profound mind body interaction. Now we know that allergies are influenced by that because you can show a personal allergic to roses, a plastic rose, and they'll have an allergy. So. So there's a learned component to allergy that can be unlearned, but have an instant. Yeah. Interesting. Now, all right. This is even more dramatic. Maybe a year later, same thing. It was LSD in the spring. I had also grown up with very fair skin and was told I couldn't get tan and we used to go down to the Jersey shore. I can't remember. I remember innumerable times, you know, gets getting second degree burns sheets of skin peeling off knock Zima at night.

Speaker 1:          00:34:17       We didn't have sunscreen in those days. Right? So, uh, I just accepted that. So it was, you know, I can't get 10. So again, high on LSD, lying out naked in my great woods in my home in Virginia and the sun was up there and I thought this is ridiculous. You know, I should not be afraid of the sun. The next day I got Tan and I have ever since, well that's a little more, I'm not quite sure of the mechanism there, but it's pretty long. Were you outside for though? Because if you're going to get burned, I was out in good time. You know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't have normally have. Yeah, at least I would have had, you know, my usual reaction, but then my skin got tan it never had in my life. So what are you suggesting happened again? You know, there must be a way in which the nervous system influences melana sites, which are the, the cell, the pigment cells in the body that can either extend their projections with pigment granules. So the nervous system controls that in the mind connects the nervous system. But what about someone who's like ridiculously fair, like what about someone who lives in Scotland? What I would do is when Dr Weil's psychedelic clinic opens, I would have an open, well we'll see, but there'll be an allergy program, right? You'd go in on the first day, you take a full dose of something and you're exposed to the allergen and magic happens. And then you come in for 10 sessions with a

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       decreasing those and at some point you're not getting, you're just getting a placebo and you don't know when that is. And people are trained to lose their allergies. I think you can do the same thing with suntanning. Maybe not with people from Scotland because they've got fewer pigment cells, but I wouldn't rule it out. I'll tell you one more also from this period I told you I was playing with Yoga. There was one posture, I couldn't do the plow where you lie on your back and try to touch your toes behind your head. I got to where I could get my toes to a foot from the floor and I had excruciating pain in my neck and I. As much as I tried that, I made no progress. So I was on the verge of giving up. I thought I was too old. He was 28.

Speaker 2:          00:36:16       So again, when in an LSD state, my body was feeling totally elastic. I thought, oh, I'll try that. So I'm lowering my feet. I thought I had a foot to go and they touch the ground. I couldn't believe it. I was raised it lowered. Oh Wow. Fantastic. The next day I tried to do it. I got within a foot of the ground and had excruciating pain in my neck, but now I knew it was possible before that I didn't know was possible, so knowing it was possible I was motivated to keep at it and then a few weeks I was able to do it. If I had not had that experience, I would've given. So I think this is the magic of these things. They can show you possibilities. They don't necessarily teach you how to, how to maintain them, but they can show you the things that possible.

Speaker 2:          00:36:56       You'd never believe what didn't even seem like it was just showing you a possibility. It was actually showing a capability. You are capable of moving in a way that you didn't think you were before and it was because of your own tension and worry. Probably learned patterns of tension that had built up all my life and maybe some because of the conscious or the psychedelic state rather. There's some alleviation of tension. My mind was out of the way. Yeah, hm. Well you do, you definitely sense that with marijuana, particularly edible marijuana, you can really get good stretching in with edible marijuana. It's almost like you. I mean, I, I hate to use certain terms to just trigger people's bullshit alarms, but there's a, you can see, you can feel more of the muscle, you can see more of what's, what it's doing, right. Whereas, you know, I'm, I've been involved in martial arts and athletics growing up my life, so I have a good awareness of my body, but it's way better when I, yeah, metal, edible, edible marijuana.

Speaker 2:          00:38:00       Like I feel, I understand like I can practice moves better, like certain, like kicking techniques. I'm better if I'm more in tune with how everything's working together. Whereas sometimes I can do it if I'm sober, but it's, I'm almost like there's a prophylactic between me and my body. There's a number next to it that gets removed by edible marijuana. One other I'm fascinated by, this was with MDM, a, uh, I was, I lived in a ranch outside of Tucson and I had pathways that had a sort of large gravel and I could not walk on

Speaker 1:          00:38:35       that barefoot. It really hurt my feet and if, you know, if I stood in them, you could see Denson, my feet on Mtma. I was able to like dance on those stones, no pain. But the interesting thing is there were no marks on my feet. So the pain is easy to figure out how that happens. But what's happening that you know, you don't get a dent. I mean, it seems to me if your mind is out of the way, maybe little muscles there can, are free to press back with just the amount of force to neutralize the pressure. It's like if your mind is not interfering, I think the body has amazing capabilities. Well, I definitely think you can mind fuck yourself. Right? And you can definitely think, ah, Oh God, this is. You can start thinking it's worse than it is. Yeah. And if you can relax a lot, oftentimes there's many situations where you relax and things aren't nearly as bad as you are making them out to be.

Speaker 1:          00:39:26       So that could be some. I'm with you on everything except the tanning, tanning. I experienced it. That's one of those things like big foot, like when you should just keep it to yourself. If you see the clip, you're supposed to just go, I'm not going to explain it. I'm not going to keep that to myself because I know when people tell me things that I have no experience of, I'm always willing to entertain the possibility. But then I got to experience it for myself. I'm willing to entertain it dependent upon who I'm talking to. Right? Because there's some Kooky people out there and you will entertain the possibility after possibilities until you die. You realize you have one big Dr Seuss book. Some people are just crazy. You know, we have to accept that. True. Yeah. There's no doubt about it. But I, I am absolutely aware that there's some component.

Speaker 1:          00:40:15       There's something about the mind and the way the mind interacts with matter and with life that has a profound effect on your body and it would be really nice if we were all better at controlling that. One of the insights that I've had in psychedelic states is that everything is conscious. That consciousness permeates everything that you know, like I, I feel whatever in me, that my consciousness is also in rocks and in plants and animals, that there are some universal something out there and it's. There are two really different ways of looking at reality. One is the materialist one, which is the consciousness is a product of brain biochemistry and electricity and that is dominant in science today. The other is that the brain is a receiving apparatus for consciousness and that consciousness is primary maybe existed before matter, maybe organized matter into forms that are more and we're able to experience themselves. I don't know, I don't think there's a way to prove one or the other. It's just that for me, the conscious is the primary one is more fun and makes life more interesting. I'm sure you're familiar with rupert sheldrick. Oh yeah. He's good friend. Very, very interesting guy. He has an idea that everything has memory. He believes that that

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       bill, this would be like the reason I guess why some people would not want to live in a haunted house. Right. They would think that if someone was murdered in the house that it would retain some memory of these atrocities and that you would somehow or another interact with that if you were in that house. So like spaces like my dad is not a very, he's not a woo kind of guy, but he went to Gettysburg and he was telling me that when he was at Gettysburg that it just, he felt profound sadness. He's like, it just seems like it's just in the ground, like the whole area. He goes, I don't know how to describe it, but I wanted to get the fuck out of there. Like just just being around this era where this battle had taken place on so many people that died.

Speaker 2:          00:42:17       I said, you could feel it, huh? Yeah. I don't know if I buy it. I mean, but he's not the Kinda guy that know. Right. But that's an example where somebody tells you something that is experienced. I'm willing to entertain it. I have to experience it myself, but it also could be, you know, like he um, he got lucky and didn't get drafted during Vietnam and that's probably in his head that if he did get drafted, he might've died over there. And for what reason he wouldn't have experienced this life know why, what is the. And then thinking about these young men that died in the same fashion for some war that didn't make any sense. Like why the fuck are they even fighting it? Like who, whose, why, why is this a. and then having all these people die together in this one horrible battle in this one place.

Speaker 2:          00:43:03       And he could have been, he was playing a game on his mind. But now joe, I want to talk to you about your language. Why the fuck do you swear so much? I don't know. Have you read anything about the science of swearing? No. Do you know that there is a science of swearing? Escience? Yes. It's pretty interesting stuff. Oh, so the part of your brain that produces swear words is not the part of the brain that manages ordinary language. Really interesting. Uh, you know, we have two language centers and our left frontal Cortex, uh, people that have strokes that damage them often lose language completely, but they can still swear. So swearing is coming from somewhere else. It may be coming from the right hemisphere, but it's also coming from deeper centers in the brain that connect to the limbic system and the Amygdala.

Speaker 2:          00:43:51       And that connects to the involuntary nervous system. So here's a couple of interesting facts. Swearing is associated with sweating, increased sweating, so you should be dripping with sweat that much. I'm a comedian also. Interesting swearing, a increases pain tolerance and there's an interesting experiment. Know the standard way they do paint colors. They have people stick their hand in a bucket of ice and water and you see how long they can keep it there. That people who say fuck shit can keep it there much longer than people who are not allowed to swear. What about noises? What if they just go? No, it was swearing specifically, so they've tried noises and swearing and so it may be, you know when you, if you're hammering a nail, hit your thumb. Yeah, you use one of those words. That's a good strategy. That's interesting because I almost always do that.

Speaker 2:          00:44:42       If I heard something, especially a finger slammed a car door the other day, I don't want to. So that's what that is, but that's. Yeah, and it's interesting. It's coming. There's a different part of the brain that that manages that has different emotional content. Yeah. It flavors language. Yes. I live them. I'm a big fan of this. Whereas I'll leave you some papers about the science of swearing. It's interesting. It's very interesting now what it will. What would happen if they were no longer taboo with the St Louis area? I think they lose their power. Yeah, right. The same areas of the brain wouldn't know. I remember there was an episode of, I don't remember what television show, but it was on cbs and they had a line at the end of the show and essentially they were saying, shit happens and it was a big deal. I'll bet it was a big deal that they wanted to be able to say shit happened and apparently they pulled this off and they got it through and it was like a 10:00 PM show, so it was okay and it was 11:00 by the time they said Shit.

Speaker 2:          00:45:39       And I remember thinking like, wow, what a strange sort of like how many people were involved in this sort of dance. Like how many lawyers and executives and who. It's very strange, very strange that this one word would treat everybody knows the word. It's not even that kind of game. We all, yes, but so, but you're saying this game is facilitated by one specific part of the brain and so that because like, I don't know, words are taboo words, taboo words and often associated with things that we find offensive or with bodily acts that freak people out. So, but so there's both, there's a psychological social aspect to it, but there's also a neurological aspect to it. Now when the words like some some words for some people, like I remember when I was a kid, I lived in Florida for a little bit and I said Hell once and in Florida in the 19 seventies.

Speaker 2:          00:46:37       Hell was a swear. Like, yeah, I don't know. I mean I came from New Jersey and then I was in San Francisco and then also in Florida and I said Hell. And they're like, don't swear like that in this class. I was like, where the fuck are you people talking about? Like it didn't make any sense to me and that I was like, you guys have different swears now. If you had a word that was not taboo to you, would it be, would that same area of your brain? I know this is, there has not been a lot of research but it hasn't been taken seriously, but that's all interesting questions I should have studied because some. I mean if you're a really super conservative person, there's a lot of words that are off the table. Yeah. But if you are a far more, which is loose with your language, you could shit this, God damn it, you know, that would be nothing like God damn.

Speaker 2:          00:47:29       It would be just like, aw shucks. Yeah, yeah. But to someone, God damn it would be like a really bad deal. Really big deal. So what would be different parts of the brain would be activated by that versus if you said it, it would be not that big a deal, but if someone was like super conservative and they said even more. Wow. Yeah. Interesting. What do you, do you think that that is a universal. I mean, it seems to be, seems to be universal. It seems to be universal. Another finding that came across is that people who learn a second language that swearing in the second language does not have the same emotional impact that your first language. Does that make sense? That's why they're so fun when you learn Spanish. Swears like you get a free ride. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker 2:          00:48:15       Yeah. And you can do them on television too, right? You can say a lot of Spanish, whereas in English speaking TV and everybody just pleads ignorance. Do you. So does every language has. They all have swears. Every language has words, swear words. It's universal. That is really interested in Asian languages, European languages. All of them, Huh? Wow. Huh. So that, that would, at least in my brain, seemed to indicate that there's some use for that. Yes. Well, probably many users. One is this thing of modulating pain. What is a social bonding? You know, forming some community. Yeah, that's how I kind of use it. I think when I swear in front of people, I'm testing them out. Like you freaking out. If I say fuck you, I can't talk to you like you too much work, you know, you don't know exactly what if you're talking to someone and every other word like, well I really wish you wouldn't use that language is there's so much work to do here.

Speaker 2:          00:49:14       I can't hold your hand dance through this garden. Right? Yeah. It's, um, it's to me also like I hang around with a lot of people that swear a lot because I hang around with professional comedians and fighters and there's a lot of swash swashbuckling, freewill and type of individuals involved in those pursuits and now they're seeing that there's some study suggesting that swearing is becoming more frequent in our society because, I don't know, it's a trend. I'm not sure anybody knows why, but I mean somebody would have been on the air like you are 20 years ago. That's true. Yeah. Well that is specifically because of the Internet because there were like, yeah, yeah. But even that, it's like, it's resisted in a lot of ways, like people are trying to figure out how to modulate this and how to handle it and they'll never handle it.

Speaker 2:          00:50:04       It's like the genie's out of the bottle. Right, exactly. Yeah. Um, I think ultimately you find what you enjoy and the best way to find with what you enjoy is people actually doing what they want to do and then you figure it out. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, that seems to be what's happening in the world of the Internet and podcasting and stuff like that. It's also the the access, right? Like a person like you, you could just put together a podcast and if people find it interesting, if it resonates, you could get a 100,000 downloads out of nowhere, like 100,000. If she have a radio show, 100,000 people listening. That's a lot of damn people. If they'd be excited and be like, Hey Andrew, we got the monthly in and you're doing great. You've got 100,000 people a day. They'd be like, Holy Shit, this is a successful business, but you could be doing that just from your office.

Speaker 2:          00:50:53       Just put together with a laptop and a microphone and no distribution whatsoever in terms of like no string of executives and gigantic corporation behind you. You don't have nobody telling you what you can say. Kansas. Yeah. Well that's one thing you get out of today that you never got out of before and you know, this is. I've been involved in show business for many years, but only this kind of stuff for nine from doing this podcast and what I've seen with this is like what's unusual. I think what resonates with people is that there isn't anybody else. There's no group of people that saying, Andrew, could you stop saying this or let's, let's concentrate on that and the polls are showing that people like this and you know, you have breaks in between what the commercials are playing and they come to you with notes and they tell you all that stuff too.

Speaker 2:          00:51:45       Seems to somehow or another ruin this natural interaction that we have with each other. Yeah. Yeah. Now for a guy like you, the Internet is. I would think that with some of your more controversial ideas like this is the way you could really air them out in long form because if you like a lot of doctors, they don't want to open their mind to anything outside of what their, what their practice. Yeah. I mean it's gonna be rough for you. Right? But I've never censored what I say. I've always put it all out there. Good for you. Yeah, I've done that all my life. But do you, don't you find that it's more not just accepted, but people are more interested in it now because of the Internet? Yeah, for sure. Yeah, absolutely. Because I've heard about you for many, many years, but it's sort of ramped up over the last decade or so, right? Yeah. Because of the Internet, right? Because people have this,

Speaker 1:          00:52:40       but you know, I've been around. It's funny when I look at this stuff like, you know, all this stuff about pot and placebos. I was saying this stuff in the 19 seventies, you know, my first book, the natural mind was published in 1972. It argued that everybody has an innate drive to alter their consciousness. You know, drugs are one way of doing it. Uh, I did the first human experiments with pot that we're ever done with a under double blonde conditions, but experiments. Did you do. I gave marijuana to people in a laboratory in 1968. And would you test them for? Well, we were just seeing people bet me you couldn't do it. Nobody had ever done this. You know, the oldest marijuana was becoming such a big thing and nobody, there were no experiments. Like what, what, what kind of experience. So we took the most basic stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:53:24       I just wanted to show that you could give it to the human subjects in a lab and get away with it because people thought, you know, I mean, in terms of the ftes, in terms of law, lawsuits, everything. And uh, one of the things I wanted to give it to people that never had it before to speak. So there'll be no expectations. Everyone said this is terrible, you know, they're going to turn it to heroin addicts from giving them stuff like that. Anyway, I just wanted to see basic stuff like does it dilate the pupils of the eyes because cops were busting people, you know, they'd say their eyes are dilated, must be high on marijuana and they'd searched, but marijuana doesn't, it doesn't dilate the pupils of the eyes. I took chat, tested blood sugar because people said the reason people get hungry is because blood sugar drops has no effect on blood sugar.

Speaker 1:          00:54:05       Uh, we showed that the people who had never had marijuana before in a lab, you could show slight decreases in performance, in motor function and cognitive function, but people who were regular users of it, you couldn't show that, that they added that too. Yeah. My take on that is that I think that people that are not regular users are freaking out. Yeah. And because their sensations and then I'll do it and they just don't. They don't know how to relax. I mean that's the big one to me with a physical movement because they want to test drivers and all sorts of things. For Marijuana. I'm like, this is not alcohol. You're now in a completely different thing. If I had a choice of being a passenger with these drivers, I'll tell you which one I would take. A person who had never used marijuana had just smoked.

Speaker 1:          00:54:58       A person who was a user of marijuana and it just smoked it. It never driven high. A person who was a user, a regular user of marijuana and practice driving high and a person with any amount of alcohol in their system. I take the third as the best, best, best. Yeah. That guy's a wizard at bet. That guy drives high every day. So He's used to it. I'm not going to show any effect on his performance. The experiences, a novel experience. And if you're accustomed to it then it's just like, here we go. This is my normal world. And for many people you have to learn to get high. You have to learn to associate the subtle physical cues with the altered state. That's a common thing. People could feel nothing the first time they try it. Yeah, you do hear that right? But I don't think they know what the fuck they're talking to.

Speaker 1:          00:55:40       Throw your eyes. Fuck. Now when you, uh, when you did these experiments, what did you have to clear these with the FPA? What did you would not believe I have to do? I had to get permission from the FDA which said that I couldn't do it unless I first got permission from it was the old Federal Bureau of narcotics, which was the treasury guys. The federal bureaucratic said, we'll give you permission once the FDA gives you permission. So they played that off, then I had to get permission from the state of Massachusetts from two agencies there and there were two universities involved, Harvard University and Boston University. So coordinating all this stuff was unbelievable. And then once the old the approvals came in, I had to get the pot and there was no legal source of it. So I, I, the Federal Bureau of narcotics

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       gave me confiscated pot that they had confiscated case in Texas. They brought it over. They had delayed for so long. I didn't even know her that time to do the experiments because I was going to graduate anyway. They brought this stuff on a Friday afternoon. It was shit. I mean it was brown dry, it looked like even sitting in a warehouse for years. So the first thing I did was roll up a joint and smoke it no effect, whatever. I called the, the agent that I dealt with and I said, this stuff is no good. And he said, how do you know you haven't had time to run any experiments? And I said, I looked at it under the microscope and there was no resonance on it, so they grumbled and they gave me other stuff which was passable. But again, confiscated stuff. Yeah. Because we always used to hear when we were kids about government, we'd the government lead was the good weed.

Speaker 2:          00:57:06       Do you remember later? That was later when that, when research got going and the US government started a pot farm in Mississippi to provide proper research, which was much better. And there was only a handful of people that were under these experiments. So they made it so difficult to conduct research as they have with psychedelics. No, that's slowly changing now. Yeah. Well, um, you know Rick Strassman? Sure. Yeah. When he was doing that book, Dmt, the spirit molecule and he did all those tests with those people. That was really groundbreaking stuff because, you know, doing it at the University of New Mexico and doing my clinical conditions, they were able to document the similarities between all these people's psychedelic experiences and do this with government approval, which I thought was really fascinating. Fascinating. Yeah. And the fact that they did it and the information's out and then there's been very little movement in that direction.

Speaker 2:          00:58:00       It's Kinda just like, okay, now we know, but look, everybody's fine. A lot of benefit do, do we want to act on this? Like, you know, it takes decades, forever and flawless. What research was done all along, it was February to look for negative effects. Uh, no. Nobody who wanted to look for positive effects. Got Permission and funding. That's interesting. So you have to kind of frame the proposal in a way that like, were these kids are fucking themselves up and we're gonna prove it sir. So that's changing. But you know, the big stumbling block now we got to get a cannabis out of that federal schedule. That's like causing a lot of problems. Yeah. There's been some noise about decriminalizing decriminalizing it federally, which is like step one. I guess that's a big stumbling block. I'll give you one example. I'm involved with a group called Maui wellness group. I'm the chief science officer now. He Hawaii. Yeah. We got the first dispensary license and growing operation over there. Oh Nice. Very good, very good example in Hawaii for medical, not for recreational, like how sick you have to be where they're getting a little you, but they're specified conditions. Hawaii's not is more uptight than a lot of other states it's happening, but uh, our licenses for Maui County, which includes Mallory Mold County, Illinois, so people from all the time and I

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       can come to Maui to buy product and our dispensary, but they can't take it back because the waters between the island or federal, they throw it still has to cross the water. Oh, that's ridiculous. You know, that's federal, that's a kind of as the kind of ridiculous situation.

Speaker 2:          00:59:37       So better to be in Maui and not better to run. I got to go to Maui to get high. That's great. What if you're really sick? Like what have you have cancer or something like that? Well, on live, on Lanai. Yeah. Well you got to violate the law, but if you have it in Lanai, you're okay. So can you grow it a. no, you can only grow it if you have a license. And the only licenses for Jesus Christ, we got to change this. California was really ridiculous when they were doing medical look. You can just basically go in there and go like, I can't sleep. Then go. Okay. Yeah. It was nothing. Like I had friends that had like long elaborate excuses. They have planned out like, you know, I was in a car accident while six and I go to bed at night and I have these horrible dreams. The only thing that helps you is marijuana and I'm just trying to feed my family and that they would go, stop, stop, stop. Okay. I'm read this script and just give it to you. There was no resistance. If you. My joke was that if you can't get a license for marijuana, you probably go to a hospital immediately because you had a real problem. Like, no man, you need an actual doctor.

Speaker 1:          01:00:38       I'll tell you a story. This is something that bothers me though I'm not. I'm not a user of pot. And I was heavily in my earlier life. A friend of mine, Dr. Colleagues in San Francisco sent me some samples of stuff that had come from a medical dispensary in San Francisco and he wanted me to try them. So one of them was a concentrated oil, it came in a little syringe and an ad had a very elaborate nicely printed brochure with it that describe the use of this pain and it said you should start with an amount the size of half a grain of rice, uh, take it orally. So yeah, my friends had taken at bedtime, so this is a teeny amount and actually I probably took somewhat less because I was afraid of getting too high on it. So I take it at bed time, went to sleep, woke up about an hour later in full blown delirium.

Speaker 1:          01:01:24       I mean, visual hallucinations as strong as I've had on LSD. I couldn't get out of bed. I, I, you know, I was immobile. Yeah. I had burning thirst. I couldn't get up to get a glass of water. I had a friends thing and a guest house I couldn't call for help. I laid there and it kept increasing. Over four hours it got stronger and stronger and when is it gonna end. Anyway, it lasted 12 hours and uh, for about 24 hours after my equilibrium was really long and this stuff is being. And it said, it said the direction said, start with this amount and work up from there. People. I'm thinking there's people driving on the streets. This stuff is out there. That scares me. Yeah. There's people that support that whole thing and their gullet right. I'm sure you know. So

Speaker 2:          01:02:12       No. A lot of the edible world is a weird world because of the, the, the response. The body is so much different than the smoking. Different drug as a lot of the, you know, the long length of time it takes. So you know, it's like lighting the fireworks and the fuse is down and you go back and try to light it again. And I'm sure you've heard the recording of the police officers who stole the pot from the kids and then ate it and then called nine slash 11 on themselves. No, never heard it. Oh, that's wonderful. I'll play it again because we played it too many times in this podcast. Okay. I'll look it up. But this poor cops, they ate pot brownies and they're calling nine slash 11 like I think. I think we're dying times moving really slowly. I think we're dead so stupid.

Speaker 2:          01:02:56       So stupid. It's, it's good for kids to hear because you realize like, oh, cops are just people. Oh, all right. Okay. It's just, it sounds like my brother, my brother got high. You know, it's crazy. People that get high, but the effect of the edible can be pretty, pretty fucking profound. And this area in particular, like Hollywood has some pre imposturous thc level. Imagine. Yeah. They're under different regulations now that it's legal statewide instead of just medical, but when it was medical only, you could get these insane concoctions. Stars of death. You ever heard of a startup that will hit you with a star at death stars, they're like 1200 milligrams. They range anywhere from like 200 to three, 400. Each little star is hundreds of milligrams and joey would eat like three or four of them ate. He would just throw them down. He's a, he's got an insane tolerance. He just wanted these guys given all this stuff. However,

Speaker 1:          01:03:59       I am delighted to see our society finally coming to better terms with this plant me to cannabis. You know, the, the, the word cannabis, the same word as canvas. All canvas sales and rope used to be made from hemp. Uh, the and the species name Sativa means useful. It's useful. It's really useful. You know, this is one plant that provides an edible seed and edible oil of high quality fiber, uh, medicine and an intoxicant that's a lot of ways for a plant to be useful. Uh, we have been very stupid in our relationship with that plant. The cannabis, it's the equivalent of the dog in the plant world. Dogs long ago made a decision to co evolve with us. They threw their evolutionary lot in with humans. Cannabis did the same thing. You can't unravel the early botanical history of cannabis because as far back in history as we go, it's always associated with human settlements. So that plant wants nothing other than to be with us at the service. And we have been so stupid, we've led a billion dollar industry and textiles go to China. We've let a million dollar industry and edible hemp products go to Canada and we have ignored. That's potential for medicine.

Speaker 2:          01:05:13       Well, I'm really hoping that things are gonna change in terms they will far cultivation hemp, you know, I'm one of the owners of on it and we sell hemp protein and one of the great. We used to get our hemp protein from Canada. Yeah. We used to have to get it from Canada. We sell it in America. We couldn't grow it here. Stupid. Well that's going to change. I'm so hopeful. It's good. It does change. It is. It's fascinating also how well the propaganda worked against it. And how long even defiance of all the facts. Now I have to tell you, when I did those pot explorers 1968, I predicted that pop was going to be legal in five years. Boy, was I wrong. I mean, I. Oh, I thought, I thought it was just a matter of getting the truthful information out there. Well, it wasn't.

Speaker 2:          01:05:58       You know, people believe what they want to believe and they don't believe what they don't want to believe in its root. It's totally irrational. Well, it's also a really excellent example of the contradictions in our society. The difference between something that's accurate and something that's perceived. Yep. And we have this perception of marrow and, and sometimes they have perceptions based on experiences. Like you might meet some really lazy, fucked up people smoke pot all the time and you go, oh, this is what pot does to you. Also it was the associations of pot because back then you know, in the fifties, sixties, it was associated with Mexican migrant workers with black jazz musicians in the south and then with radicals and hippy, so all scary people to mainstream, you know, middle class white society and of course all accentuated by William Randolph hearst and Harry anslinger and the reefer madness films.

Speaker 2:          01:06:52       Those are great. They're great. Anybody hasn't seen those out there? It's amazing how something that was terrifying to someone back then is so silly today when you watch the reefer madness to. It's really funny and at the same time we're living with the two most dangerous drugs that are out there with alcohol and tobacco. Well, how about fentanyl? That one's cute shit out of me to just keep wrapping that one up and making it more and more potent. Yeah, just the idea that opioids weren't killing people quick enough that we needed to make some ridiculously potent versions of it and apparently now there's they're approving something that's even more powerful like, but why would you do that? But you know, on a physiological level, opioids are not that bad for your body. The worst effect of being addicted to an opioid overtime is chronic constipation.

Speaker 2:          01:07:43       I mean that's annoying, but that's not like cirrhosis of the liver degeneration of the nervous system, but overdoses, overdoses, of course, that kills me by stopping your respiration, but there are many examples of people who have been addicted to opioids who have been able to get legal supplies and he used them extensively. They're healthy. I've heard about that when in terms of regular heroin use that I had a friend who was a Longshoreman, and this is like when I was a kid, he was explaining to me how this guy that he worked with would get a bag of heroin every day at lunch

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       and he would shoot it in his car and he would just sit in his car during lunch hour and then when the time was up you'd go back to work. I was like, what? He said he would do that everyday. I'm like, she's going to be dead in a week. No, no. He knows that if he knows the other take care of himself. Apparently he did. Apparently he would do it all the time. Right. I guess find a new vein and figuring out how to do it and not famous historical example. That's great. There was a man named William holstead who was a surgeon at Johns Hopkins University in the early 19 hundreds. He invented a local anesthesia and so get a great guy. He started using cocaine and injected self-injected cocaine and not a good thing, and his, you know, his behavior got really bad, not good, so at some point his group of his colleague kidnapped them and took them on a yacht for several weeks and he came back, supposedly cured, had a long life as a very successful productive surgeon, and only after his death was it revealed that what had happened on that trip was that they had gotten them off cocaine and onto intravenous morphine for the rest of his life.

Speaker 1:          01:09:21       He was an intravenous morphine user. Did Not in any way interfere with his health or productivity. I would assume that if you're doing that every day, you're going to run into issues with your veins. Well, yeah. Presumably, you know, he knew how to rotate around that, that I wouldn't want to do that, but there it is. Oh, but the point is that it's a whole different game from alcohol and tobacco. Yeah, a whole a whole different game, but all problems, it's the. It's the social toxicity of it. It's that it's that people are buying illegal impure materials and overdosing and so forth. That's not the, uh, the nate pharmacological nature of the drug. What's been disturbing to me as a person, as an observer, is watching people who get injured, get hooked on it, get it particularly pills yet it seems that, uh, my, my good friend Brendan, he had his nose broken and he got his nose fixed and they put him on pills and before he knew it, he was taking those pills everyday for months and months and months.

Speaker 1:          01:10:17       And his friends eventually just took him out of his medicine cabinet and they just made an intervention. So, you know, this is, I think the, uh, the opioid crisis that we've got in this country is a fabulous opportunity for integrative medicine because the realization is that you cannot manage chronic pain solely with use of opioids. So there has to be individualized integrative treatment that use, uses different modalities. It could be everything from acupuncture, yoga, mind body stuff, diet, and that all has to be the state of Oregon a couple of years ago passed an integrative pain management initiative saying that all pain, chronic pain management had to be integrated and they listed the different modalities. They left out mind body medicine, which to me is one of the most important. Yeah. Mind body medicine though on any sort of report that seems like that's when like, okay, what kind of.

Speaker 1:          01:11:07       But look, you know I studied. I'm with you. Yeah. I studied hypnosis after I got out of my medical training and one of the most interesting courses I ever took. There's a well known demonstration in, in the literature on hypnosis. You can take a person deeply hidden. Pfizer's got good trans capacity, touch them with a finger that you represent to be a piece of hot metal and they get a blister and you can take the same person that touched him with a piece of hot metal and tell them it's cold and they don't get a blister. Wait a minute. Well, yes. Well known phenomenon. This is actually if you ever seen this. Yes. Real life. Yes. So someone's taken a hot piece of metal and convince someone that did not going to burn it. Don't burn close too, by the way. That the Suntan stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:11:49       How long do you touch them with it for? You know enough in an ordinary person that up. I call bullshit. I call bullshit. So we'll try it. Let's try it. I'll get you under cook your hand. Yes. It's like it's hot. If it's hot, it's gonna fuck you up now. Well I think if it's held there long enough so like, like it's one of those things like the walking on coals to. Absolutely. Which I've done a number of times I'm sure, but if it's cold, you know this then that coles are not a very good conductor of heat, which is why you don't Cook Bullshit because. Yes. I'll tell you what my experience was I. The first time I tried it a, I was with a group of maybe 40 people and it was a standard length of the firework was about 12 feet. It was a hot fire was mosquito.

Speaker 1:          01:12:34       It was in my yard in Tucson and the guy came in, it was early in the days of firewalking and he had this long for our thing to get people ready. Uh, I was not in the right mental state when I did it and my experience was it felt fucking hot and then it got to the end of it, the condensed down to a number of points that really burned. And I had listeners the next day and most people that have walked that night, it looked like they were not in the right mental state, but I saw a few people who strolled across it that looked. They were in some interesting altered state. So I wanted to try it again next time I did it, I shouldn't have done it. I was with a guy who was a real jerk who thought of himself as a self styled grew small group.

Speaker 1:          01:13:17       It was a shorter maybe eight foot cooler bed of coals. And I got significant burns from that. So like an annoying guru. So it's really annoying saying no idea what he was like, this guy's a jerk off and then you're getting annoyed so you're out of your mindset. Right? And I burned my feet so I said I'm not going to do this again. And then a friend of mine was doing some intensive workshop with Tony Robbins and Christ and it was going to end the last day they were going to do try to set a record for the longest firewalk done in America. So he wanted me to come up. So I went up there, I thought I'm going to watch, I'm not going to do it. So it was a 40 foot bed of coals and it was really odd and he had like a troupe of African drummers and people are dancing and drumming. It was like midnight and people were getting in line to walk and I said, I'm not going to do this. Not going to be by family self going up there. And I was right there and he taps me on the shoulder and says, you're ready. It felt like walking through crunchy croutons.

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       There was no sensation of heat. I walked slowly, I kind of wiggled my feet in the things and when I got to the end of it, I felt so high. It was like I want to ask that I had energy rushes through my body. I had nothing on my feet, so on a much shorter, cooler walk. Those coals conducted just fine, and then this one, it's a mind body thing. It's not about the conductivity of the Tony Robbins hitting you with some for gazy coals hot. I mean you could barely get at the edge of the thing. Men, the heat was amazing. He know the Tony Robbins one. It's what's really interesting is recently they've developed this issue with people trying to take selfies while they're walking across the coals, burning their feet. It's become a significant issue because it didn't happen till like within the last night. Never heard of that.

Speaker 2:          01:14:59       I think that would get you right out of the proper state. Yeah. There was a big article about it. Article about these people really fucking their feet up well deserved. You really think that you have the ability to mitigate the amount of effect that fire and Cole hot coals. I don't have any proof of this is my intuition. I think what happens if your mind is out of the way you can take, you can absorb energy and let it flow through your body rather than getting blocked in the tissues where it causes damage. And I've seen this in other situations as well and I think the problem is ordinarily our mind is in the way of that and does not let the body freely do that. And I think that applies to things like getting hit really hard, uh, heat getting hit really hard. How, what do you mean?

Speaker 2:          01:15:50       Getting, letting someone hit you as hard as they can with something that would cause damage and that doesn't. Oh, that's crazy. No, it's not. I've experienced it. Yeah, I'm sure you have. But are there other real scientific studies that show that nobody's studied it? I'd love to study. Nobody's studied firewalking, you know, the usual scientific explanations like we probably shouldn't talk about this until they do do studies because it seems so simple to do these studies and I'm not fighting for a second. I think if I hit somebody, they're going to fucking hurt. Right? If you get deontay wilder to punch you, I don't give a fuck how much Tony Robbins talks to you and common experience. A drunk involved in car accidents don't get injured. Okay, but do you know why? Because they're totally relaxed. Yes, but that has nothing to do at some altered state of consciousness is not allowing the injury to actually map out of the way and their body is totally relaxed, so that's the tension of falling you.

Speaker 2:          01:16:42       You hurt yourself because you're defending yourself. You're right, right you. Your body is better off giving in to the old saying it's the same thing with the fire, but it can't be. That's a different thing because you're not. It's on the surface of your skin, which is causing the heat tense in your nervous system, which is not letting not able to absorb that thermal energy and Brown. We're going to do studies. Burn you anytime. We'll try it, buy it. It just. I think there's certainly you can mitigate the sensation of pain. I don't believe that you can do anything about the actual physiological change to a hot piece of metal interacting with the tissue of your skin. I just think that like the steak does not know it's being cooked. It's just getting cooked. You're going to get cooked. You are a meat. I just don't.

Speaker 2:          01:17:34       I don't buy that. I'll show you some of these studies on hypnosis. There's doctors right now going, yes. You tell them Joe Rogan. This is nonsense. Well, I believe hypnosis. I do believe that, but I. I absolutely believe you can achieve different states of mind where you feel things differently. Your, your concentration, your relaxation is in a different state. Your mind set is in a different state. I do not believe that you can change the physiological nature of your body's ability to absorb punishment like a punch or kick. I do that same thing of absorbing the sun. Let's set some studies up. Sorry. How are we going to make these tests? I don't know. I'll have to figure it out. We'll talk. If they're doing this forever. How do you not know? This should be. You should have these studies already done. I want to talk about these things to do.

Speaker 2:          01:18:22       I know, but this is a significant icon rotation point because if it's proven, this is really huge and if you could really take off hot metal rod that right out of the fire and touch someone's skin, they're in the right state of mind. You don't burn them. That would be giant. Yes. I am coming here with you. I'll send you some literature on hypnosis that shows this kind of. I'm sure that someone wrote some shit down. I'm sure I want to see actual real studies. I want to see and I want to. I mean in this day and age, there's no reason not videotape, but it's true. Come on. All right, so a lot of stuff to do. This is a big one though because this is something that will will people, right healers and you know a lot a lot of people like to bring up and when you press them on it there's no evidence for it and it's like, well anecdotal evidence.

Speaker 2:          01:19:11       Well I've heard, well I work with a healer and he tells me like, okay, do you know what the literal meaning of anecdote is? No. It means unpublished in Greek. It does not mean stupid, not worth paying attention to. Anecdotal evidence is often actually so and it. And it inspires you to do the experiments. So will you go ahead and do that? I'll report that hot piece of metal on your report back. Yeah. And I'm going to go look at that burn. I'll report back to you. Yeah. I mean I'm not saying that anecdotal evidence is always inaccurate. It's most certainly accurate many times. Sometimes. Sometimes. Yeah. Just his likelihood that it's not that it is, but anecdotal enough is what gives you a hypothesis test. Sure. But it's just not good enough to stay, especially when something that doesn't make sense chemically. Physiologically. Alright.

Speaker 2:          01:20:01       It doesn't make sense. But I told you about my experience with Sun Tan that. Does that make sense? It the Europe trip and your balls off and. Yeah. And something happened in my body. That would be interesting if that was some sort of interchange and your body's ability to produce melanin. Yeah. Or what is it? Melancholy. It's, how do you say? Atlanta, Atlanta sites sites. So your and they're controlled. They're sites are related to neurons and they're. They're influenced by nerve connection. So it seems to be perfectly possible that mind through the nervous system changes the behavior Mylanta sites. Sort of like how your body can ramp up adrenaline or anxiety or any also can ramp up melana sites. Yeah. That doesn't seem like outside of the realm of possibility. That seems like obviously some people. When I first told it to you, you said it was outside the realm of possibility.

Speaker 2:          01:20:52       Not outside, but sounds crazy. Definitely sounds crazy. But I mean it seems like that would be something also that would really warrant study. Absolutely, especially those poor pastey ass motherfuckers out there on the beach turning bright red like, come man, you just got to think about it the right way. You imagine if you just told people it was like a meditation and then you just get a nice Tan. Yeah, good thing. It would be a good thing. Now when it comes to like we were talking about autoimmune issues. Like I, I have video, I go, you see spots on my hands where I don't get any pigment. How do I fix that? Fix that. My brain, you know, all I can tell you is I would try to see if you an influence through hypnosis or through guided imagery to see if you can change it in any way.

Speaker 2:          01:21:37       I don't know. Hypnosis and guided imagery. Yeah. There are two mind body techniques. I think it's worth trying. I did read once that there was this, I think it was a young man who had some awful one of those awful war diseases and there was one called theosis, which is like the whole covered with this callous, tarred tissue and it went away. Hit Moses. Yes. Yeah. Over time I burned that case too. They told him that like his arm, that one arm was going to be cured and it just like, I remember that lately. Eliminated all the warts on that one. I remember that. Yeah. And they couldn't figure out how or why and they couldn't recreate it. So the ward stuff that's very well documented and work cures. There's so many different work. Who are, some of them are quite funny. Yeah. Uh, you know, you have to, you have to, uh, uh, a particular plant under the full moon and Robin and barry above the falls off the next morning.

Speaker 2:          01:22:39       And when you compare that to the way we deal with warts medically, we burned them off, freeze them off, cut them off in most of the time when we do that, they grow back and multiple clusters when they got, when the mind gets rid of them through this method, they're gone. So we want to find out how to make that happen more than fun. Yeah, that's real, right? I mean this is, this is actual real documented science. That is what is so interesting to me about the placebo effect is that it is a real, that your mind has this capability of healing itself in this very, very powerful way, but we don't exactly know how to turn it on or off. Right? And it can do the opposite too. There's a phenomenon called Voodoo death. We're in societies where there which Dr Sherman's a malevolent, which Dr can curse a person and the person goes home, lies in bed, stops eating, and over days or weeks dies will.

Speaker 2:          01:23:30       So what more could you ask of in the way of a mind body effect? Uh, he put a curse on what was the basketball team. They were talking shit about them. Put a curse on them and they couldn't win a Goddamn game in a few times. Yeah, he's put a curse on a few different to, oh, he's like a real, how would you say? Spiritual. Very positive. Mostly like real love oriented guy. But occasionally I'll put a hex on a dude and when he puts a hex on, you got a real problem on your heart. Apparently it's been very effective and people freak out when Lil B Hex Ism little b puts that hex on you, like dammit. And then he releases the Hex is lifted them. He lifts the Huh. And when he lifts them, everything goes back to normal. All right. This is weird, man. This is like a weird because everyone's aware when he puts a curse on you and when, when he does, people are gone.

Speaker 2:          01:24:21       No, I can't believe this. Like the idea of curses like a, the, the Voodoo curse or a gypsy curse on you. That is a. well that's the negative side effects that it has a name. It's called the no cbo effect. Noxious rather than pleasing. Yeah. That is um, that's a documented thing as well, right? That people can believe that something is wrong with them. And then they start mine. Yeah. Fucking themselves into this terrible state. And then they start screwing things up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hot started. Here it is. Kevin Duran says, I tried to listen to little b. my mind wouldn't let me do it. I can't believe this guy's relevant. Was like, okay bitch. Kevin Durant will never win the title after he said Lil B as a whack wrapper, the base, God's curse, Hashtag the base. God's curse on direct and then he always signs his tweets will be funny, but it works. It works. Kevin Doran is sitting at home right now thinking of the millions that must have cost is one now one now. But he could have bought a house with all that money lost those years. A little be fucked over in a corner.

Speaker 2:          01:25:34       But that. I mean, I think the opposite is true too. So somebody could put blessings on you. Like there was a fighter that we had in here the other day, deontay wilder, he's the WBC heavyweight champion of the world. And he said that from the time he was a little boy, his grandmother had him convinced that he was like an anointed one, that he was special and that she would always say that to his parents like, you know, don't you hit him like this one's special, you know, he's gonna, raise everybody up. And then he turned out to be like one of the greatest heavyweight champions ever in terms of like his record. He's 40 now with 39 knockouts and he's a phenomenally successful fighter and in his mind he believes that he has some like magic property or that there's something to him. He's a ridiculous knockout artist to me.

Speaker 2:          01:26:18       Obviously there's a lot of physiological aspects of that and he's a big, long, tall guy with crazy knockout power. You can't fake power. You either have it or you don't, but he's got it and he's got this weird confidence too. And you gotta wonder how much of them actually is operating under this idea that his grandmother was right about him having some magical properties. And so he goes through life that this vision. Yeah. Powerful. Yeah. How you trick people into thinking that way. The whole nation full of a dlt while there's a nation full of doctors are afraid of the placebo effect because they think it's tricking people, keeping them. And it's not. It's like it's you know when, when you present a treatment to a patient, your belief in the treatment as a, as a practitioner catalyzes the patients believe the best way I can do that as if I give a patient something that I've tried myself and I know from my own experience that it works and then I can present it in a way with my confidence and that increases the patient's confidence and increases the likelihood of a favorable outcome.

Speaker 2:          01:27:22       Even controversial therapies. Yes, and even Wayne example, something you see when you give a pharmaceutical drug to a patient, I think there's, there's the direct effect of the drug and then there's a halo of belief effect and you know, an interesting phenomenon is that there's a famous saying in medicine that you should use a new remedy as much as possible before it loses the power to heal. And this is a common experience that drugs work best near the time of their introduction. That's also the case with diets as well. Absolutely, and the longer they're around, what I think what happens is people have faith in new things, so there's a big halo of placebo effect over time that shrinks and it leaves the stuff on its own which may not be very impressive. This is often the case when people take on a radical diet like on opposite ends of the spectrum, whether it's a carnivore diet and aware that a lot of people swear it fixed Somalis Ales or Vegan Diet.

Speaker 2:          01:28:16       Very similar effects, obviously very different diet. Exactly, so it's the mind. The mind to mind is where it's at, how do we, how do we end? The big problem in science and medicine is that we don't believe in the mind. No, that's what I was saying earlier when you were talking about mine. It's not material. It's not. That's the problem when you're talking about mind, body interactions or work curious placebo effects, you're talking about a an nonmaterial cause of a physical event and that is not allowed in the materialistic paradigm that science, when we observed a change in the physical system, the dog is the cause has to be physical. When you talk about a nonphysical causes a physical event, scientists to now,

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       well that's really unfortunate because we know so much about how attitude does shape the way your body reacts to things. Going back to the SAR, no stuff, you know that with back pain, all that stuff. It's like you know that to me that the. You can't separate the mind and body. There are two poles of the same thing. Well, if the placebo effect is real and it's documented, it's documented, so obviously something is going on with the way you feel about things and think about things that it's having an actual physiological effects. There's something happening to your body because the way you're thinking about are happening to your body. Now, one of the things that has made this suddenly have interest in the medical world is that we now have these techniques like functional Mris, pet scans, where we can observe living brains and you can show that the placebo response is associated with particular activity in certain brain centers that has made it real for people that otherwise didn't believe in it.

Speaker 1:          01:29:58       Yes, right? Like there's a medically documented. There's something they actually get a hook into. Yeah, you can. You can put it on a scale. Yes, exactly. Yeah. What part of the brain is responsible for the placebo effect? Well, again, it's probably some of these deep brain centers that the same ones involved in Sweden and wearing the same thing. It's coming from centers that connect to emotional read to emotion. Yeah. The ability to turn that on off consciously and willingly. This is tricky. Yeah. You know, another thing I looked at over the years was healing shrines in the world like Lord the. There's two interesting facts about that. Over the years, the Catholic Church has accepted very few healings as genuine that or have full medical documentation and some of them are quite spectacular, like miraculous disappearance of widely disseminated cancer. No native of Lord has ever been cured and the chances that a person that's going to be healed there explained, Lord, this is a place as a place in France where you know, a, a, a, you know, a child saw visions of the Virgin Mary and anyway, growing up into a, there's a grotto and you know, it's now a major Catholic drawing and it has a reputation for healing and thousands and thousands of people over the years of going there.

Speaker 1:          01:31:18       So as I said, very, you know, there was relatively few reported healings that had been docked, fully document medically, but no native of Lord has ever been healed. And the, there's something called the Lord phenomenon, which is fascinating that the chances that a person is going to be healed at Lord or a place like that is directly proportional to the length of the journey traveled. Yeah, I have heard that. So the length of the journey is, is an investment of belief, right? So you're projecting belief onto the plate place and then you get it back. Yeah. That that seems like that could essentially work with any very, very difficult absolution, quest types of experience that you're going on. You're looking for something and you have to earn it.

Speaker 2:          01:31:59       Yeah. And you have to be fully invested. There has to be something going on in the mind that has you convinced this is a real effect, but the power is not in the place. The powers in here and you're projecting it onto that. But man wouldn't be better if you didn't have to go all the way. That'd be great. And how do you, how do you get that going? Like if someone said to you, okay man, I don't want to go to the Lord, but uh, what, what should I do? Well, one is the acute. Imagine you're going to Lord in. That's taking advantage of this function of visualization. That's why these therapies like guided imagery seem to work that you can imagine something and have it become real guided imagery. Now is there a specific, you know, like there's like transcendental medication. There's boots, a formal, it's a formal system of therapy that people are trained in. Were you, uh, you know, you sit with a practitioner and they help you explore your mental imagery and a May give you specific kinds of images to work with depending on the condition that you're dealing with.

Speaker 2:          01:33:00       I would think knowing the fact that we were, we have real evidence that placebo effect works. Why isn't there more study done to try or more thought and more, more people that are trying to emphasize disability of the talent and we're up against this problem that in the dominant paradigm in science and medicine, we don't believe in nonphysical causation of physical events, but that doesn't jive with me because we do believe in a placebo effect. Like everybody says that, oh, it's just a placebo. Right? You said that earlier. People always say that, but it still works. Right? But, but we're not using it. Right. We should be using. It should be used. It's the meat of medicine. We want to make it happen more at the time. God Damn it. It's just, we're so flawed in our approach. It's really interesting. It's like the human body and the human mind is such an incredibly complicated biological entity, right?

Speaker 2:          01:33:57       Our ability to consciously be aware of our, our, our life, our position in the world, our mortality, the insignificance of us in the greater scale. All those things are like they are right now all the time, but you don't have any users manually. Exactly. We have this incredible machine that can invent nuclear bombs and satellites and there's no union users manual, no user's manual for the mind or the body, especially not in how to manage the body with the mind. Nothing figured out, bitch wide open on your own because few people have got it. You got to like find these masters. Right? So if you think about the 300 and whatever million people we have in this country, how many of those people could guide you towards a, a proper integration of mind and body and a positive way of interfacing with reality that's beneficial to you physically, mentally, spiritually, not many.

Speaker 2:          01:34:53       Is there a dozen? Not many. Isn't it interesting with all these human beings and essentially most of them trying to improve in some way, even people that fail on diets, but they'd like to get skinny? Even people that fail at school, while I wish I was smart enough to graduate, I wish I had enough discipline people people want to do better, so there's this vast need for coaching that would lead to improvement yet almost mean nothing to speak of and certainly not nothing large scale in any city that has this approach where, look, we're going to teach you how to better engage with the material world around you and the better engage with reality itself. That's going to leave you a more spiritually, physically, emotionally fulfilled like that. It seems like that'll be a big business. It would go. One way to teach this stuff is by example that if a person exemplifies, you know, good mind, body functioning, they can inspire that and another person that seems like maybe the only way, one strategy that I.

Speaker 2:          01:35:57       If I can do this, if I have a patient, if I can introduce that patient to someone who's had their condition is now better, that is a very powerful way to up their belief in the possibility of getting better. Yeah, that makes sense. Which is why people love user testimonials. Right. But, but better if you actually meet the person and show see for yourself, but use your testimonials are so huge for that. Raise your right. You know, I was skeptical at first, but then I tried it and boy he was skeptical just like me. It to me when I look at the giant number of people that are unhappy and displaced and just seem like they're left out of society. I was listening to. Oh, it was Johann Hari on Sam Harris' podcast. They were talking about the number of people that are happy with what they do for a living.

Speaker 2:          01:36:54       Happy with what they do every day. And it was somewhere around 13 percent and long. Yeah. And then the number of people that were just like, it's okay. I just do it. Like, I don't hate it, but I don't love it. That was like in the 60 percent and then the rest of the people fucking hated what they did. So the vast majority, some ungodly number, you know, like 87 percent of people hate what they're doing. Oh, how sad. Or if don't hate it, they don't want to be doing it and they do it all the time. Yeah. That's crazy that, that has to have a profound effect on all aspects of your life. Right. I like what I do when you seem like you do, you have a twinkle in your eye when you talk about it, but I mean it's got to give you some satisfaction for sure.

Speaker 2:          01:37:42       Right. Yeah. Help all these people. Absolutely. And also to see a lot of the things that I've, uh, you know, believed for so long, becoming more mainstream. It's good. Yeah. And much more so now than ever before. More so now than ever before. Yeah. When you were doing those studies in the 19 sixties and you thought that marijuana is going to be legal in five years, how could you have ever. First of all, how could you have ever thought of the Internet? Right. That's the big thing. The distortion of information. Sure. Yeah. That's, that's really the big one. The decentralized APP distribution of information, and that's by the way in medicine has really. It's one of the things that's most leveled the playing field between doctors and patients sort of ended the authoritarian, paternalistic kind of medicine. That was when I grew up. Well, it's, it is a problem, right?

Speaker 2:          01:38:27       A patient comes. They think they know everything. Yeah. But I had seen, I have seen many, many patients who have gotten exactly the information they needed and were able to take it to the doctor who didn't know about it. I mean, I think on the whole it's a really good thing. Oh yeah, for sure. No, no, for sure. I'm saying just like I get how doctors would be worn out by it all the time. No less than I'm a, I went to school. This is what it is. Well, it's good for them to have to let go of that. Yeah. Well, there's no way you could know everything. True. And especially doctors, they must know that they have a specialty for a reason because the human body is so insanely complicated. There's no way anybody is a general specialist of every single aspect of medicine, but we need more generalists.

Speaker 2:          01:39:07       One of the problems that we've got too many specialists and there's. Yeah, so someone like would you think of a generalist as someone who sort of guides you towards various specialists? I'm a general practitioner and I'm very proud of it. There's good data showing that states that have a higher number of prime of, of, of a primary care physicians, family doctors have better medical outcomes than patients with a high percentage of specialists that the problem, some specialties pay more. So we should be changing that. We should be providing financial incentives for people to go into general medicine. Yeah. Would also make sense to that. By the time you get to a specialist, usually you're really messed up. Right? And if you're going to a back specialist, you might have like a real situation. It's been bothering me for a long time. Whereas you go into a general practitioner for a checkup.

Speaker 2:          01:39:51       This is my biannual checkup. He just kind of giving you the once over making sure everything's okay. How do you sleep and high eating, drinking, smoking cigarettes, what's going on? Just get a sense of you, but they do they have enough. Time is not a big issue. Like what time do you spend when you, when you're working with patients? I take an hour and in our clinics we do 90 minutes on a first session. That's gotta be nice. Ninety minutes you can get to know somebody, but if you're getting in and out of that office in 10 minutes he'd just, here's a prescription. Get out of here next. You know the, the has been studies on the amount of time in a medical encounter when a patient starts to talk, how soon a doctor interrupts the patient. Do you have any guess what that is now? Thirteen seconds. You're right.

Speaker 2:          01:40:36       Really? Yeah, 13 seconds. I used the same number of people that are happy with what they do. Ha, there you go. That's pretty good. Thirteen seconds. Wow. Well, on my. My foot hurts and I've been okay. Here you go. Shut the fuck up. You didn't take this. Take this opium. Yeah. Have you ever eaten in a true food kitchen? What does that mean? It's a restaurant. True food kitchen. No, I don't know what that is. Well, it's a restaurant that I started and there's now 25 of them. He got two and two and out in La and one in Pasadena where I'm going to go after the show and I'm in Pasedena tonight. All right. You want to go to a comedy club? All right. What time? I'll be there for dinner if you want to come over there. True food kitchen. Yeah, it's great. It's delicious.

Speaker 2:          01:41:24       Healthy food. It's wonderful food that conforms. The good nutritional principles. It's anti inflammatory diet and there's something for everyone. There is like meat. There's Vegan options, vegetarian, gluten free. It's very delicious. Food, true food kitchen. It's become an incredibly successful restaurant concept. Well, that's a great idea to be able to serve people. Things that you know for a fact are going to be healthy and nutritious. Not just taste good, but good for you. Primarily. It's food that looks great and tastes great and happens to conform to good nutritional science. Yeah. That is possible and that's a lot of people think you have to eat fried chicken and we'll come in there and try it. I would love to try it all right. Definitely. How do you eat for the most part? You said you eat fish and you eat through the full. I try to grow a lot of my own food. I love food, fresh stuff out of the garden. I like to cook and I invent recipes which is, you know, a lot of the recipes and the restaurant or mine a great. So I, I like simple, simple, quick preparations that are really good. Do you fast at all? I have been. I've experimented with intermittent fasting and I haven't found a regimen that works exactly right for me, but I'm fascinated by it. I do a 18 or 16 and eight. And how often do you do that? I try to do it four days a week.

Speaker 2:          01:42:39       Sometimes it's difficult when I travel. Yeah. But uh, even then I'm more accustomed to it than ever before. So if I eat dinner at 8:00 at night, it's, it's not hard to wait till she's back. Okay. Yeah, it's not hard. My body's just really used to it now. How long have you been doing it? About a year or so. Maybe a little bit more than that. Yeah. I think that makes a lot of sense. And uh, continue to experiment with what I haven't done that I really have been thinking a lot about doing is doing a multiple day fast. Just a water fast. I've done that for the longest. I've done it for three days. How was that? The first day was difficult. Um, or actually the second day was difficult the third day. Fabulous. You know, I felt energized. Hi. My mind working very clear. The problem that I have is how do you come off it because it's very easy to slide into eating pizza krispy Kreme to.

Speaker 2:          01:43:32       Exactly. Yeah. I think there's protocols in terms of like small amounts of fruit, right? Like right when you're coming out of blueberries, which to me was. The tricky part was transitioning off it go too fast with the buzzer. Rang schools out for summer. Yeah, I get it man. I mean especially if you feel like you earned it right, you didn't eat for three days. You want that pizza. Right. One of the things I found when I was doing it, having a bowl of March, I, I normally my my pattern is I want to eat as soon as I get up so that those morning hours are hard for me, but if I have a, have my macho that helps. Do you exercise? I do. I swim mostly walk everyday. I find that once my body got used to fast to exercise, it became much, much easier and it just became like before I would almost have anxiety attached to it.

Speaker 2:          01:44:25       Like God, I can't work out without food. I have to eat. And then when I started doing the intermittent fast and then I started doing fasted exercise, I think it was. I'm sure I pr if you probably measured me in terms of like a. He did a bunch of like weight lifting exercises and measured my output. I probably would be able to lift more weights if I had some fruit first. I'm pretty sure I'd have a little bit more energy, probably measurable, but it's not difficult to have a vigorous workout in the morning when you're fasting. You just kinda get used to it. And I often do either hot yoga or run first thing in the morning. Weight lifting seems to be a bit of an issue with weight lifting. I don't like. I like to eat something before I lift weights. Huh? Yeah. But swimming.

Speaker 2:          01:45:12       But you ever fasted swim? It's fine. No problem with it now. Why don't you get off the pot? You know, it changed for me in, in I, I really used it regularly in my twenties and thirties and when I first started using it, uh, it was great. I mean it was like hilarious highs, laughing a lot of them. Then it turned after several years more introspective and, and interesting. I like creative writing for helping, writing, stuff like that and then gradually transitioned into making me groggy and not doing much for me. And for, you know, it took me a while to separate myself from it, but in the last years of it it was groggy and sedated that I think I changed my body changed. That's interesting. Have you ever tried different strains? I have. First of all, I don't like to smoke because I'm really into breathing and I just kept put smoke in the oil.

Speaker 2:          01:46:09       Right. I've tried a vaping. I don't, I just don't like the effect of it these days. Aping, I just don't like the effect, you know, I don't like oral feels, you know, it's too strong for me. Yeah. Well when you're talking about that half of a half a grain of sand putting you on Pluto for agreement sand that funny. Imagine that at that would be like acid. Yeah, it was. Felt like acid. Yeah. Well boy, I'll tell you, um, for me, the most profound and intense experience I ever have in the sensory deprivation tank or edible marijuana. Edible marijuana in that tank. That combination is just. Whoa. Huh. A real strong dose because you. Have you done the tank at all? Yeah. But not with. Not with pot. And psychedelics long time ago. Yeah. Well even sober you have some pretty trippy experiences while you're in there.

Speaker 2:          01:47:01       But there's something about the, what I experienced with edible marijuana is that, uh, when you close your eyes you get a lot of really cool visuals. Like I've had it before when I take pot and then get on a plane, like I'll, I'll eat right. Right when I parked my car at the airport or when I'm leaving the house. Then it kicks in when you're on the plane. Like closing your eyes, Huh? Something about closing your eyes. The you have like really brightly colored colored visuals oftentimes. And I get that a lot inside the tank with marijuana. Huh? I had that with that real strong stuff. I definitely had a lot of visual stuff. Yeah. That's what's weird about it. Right? It's like it does become a psychedelic. Yes. Especially at high dose. Why are they making that stuff so strongly unnecessary when, how many milligrams did they say it was?

Speaker 2:          01:47:53       I wasn't much because they've got these damn Chiba Chews. They're like 500 milligrams for one little cake. One little thing like that bank, 500 milligrams, like why do you need that? Because you started out with 10 and then you worked your way up to $500. I mean, I guess there's a tolerance issue which a lot of folks, right? Yeah, yeah. Do you, um, do you regularly meditate or to do every morning when I get up what kind of meditation? I first uh, practices in and then I took some of the positive training and now I get up, I sit down, I do my breathing routine and then I just try to focus on body sensations and the sounds in the room and when I'm caught up in my thoughts I just bring my attention back to my breathing. But, you know, for me, I think that the sitting sitting in meditation, that's fine.

Speaker 2:          01:48:53       But I think the goal is to be able to carry that state and all of your activities. Uh, so for me cooking is meditative, chopping vegetables, working with knives and uh, that's very meditative for me. So when do you think that when you're having this meditation, whether it's Zen or whatever, that your, you're resetting the way you're gonna go through life for the rest of the day. Hopefully that's the goal is to carry that state throughout the day where you kind of have a responsibility. Don't you agree? Like your guy who's teaching people how to live a more productive, healthier, live. You kind of have a responsibility to live your own productive, healthy, live better. Right. I wouldn't feel right doing that if I didn't practice it more slippery. Right? Yeah. But I don't tell people to do things. I don't do it myself. When you have some thoughts about things like something like a Boga, would you be interested in trying it yourself?

Speaker 2:          01:49:50       Sure. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't had the opportunity to do it. It's supposed to be ruthlessly interspective [inaudible]. I've never done it either, but I've had, I've had friends who had a pill problems who, who did it and cured them, but they said the ride is just 24 hours of like, what in the fuck am I doing? And then once it's over, you have zero desire the way that it's used. Traditionally in Africa, the root, it's these tribes that user that's hunters take it and they remained motionless for many hours on it. The animals come close. I mean, that always fascinated me. That is fascinating. Yeah. I wonder if, uh, taking it from the root. I wonder if they have, if it's, they're getting the exact same experiences they're getting in these clinics. I don't know. It just to me in terms of efficacy, if you look at the recidivism rates of relapse rather, they're mean they're sir rubbery high.

Speaker 2:          01:50:48       Yeah. It's crazy, right? Yeah. How successful that stuff yet. And yet nobody wants to talk about that. These are all these clinics, like it's crazy how many rehab clinics or are they? We need you for six months. Really? Mexico says they kill it all in three days.
