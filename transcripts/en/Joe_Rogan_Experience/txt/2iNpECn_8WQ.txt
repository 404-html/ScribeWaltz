Speaker 1:          00:00:04       And we're live Mr Sharma. Welcome. Thanks. Thanks for having me. Thanks for being here, man. Appreciate it. I have been paying attention to your work for a long time. It's a no, you're the one who bakes. Yes. I'm one of those guys. I'm sure you've got a lot but a bunch of your books here. Thanks for bringing those in. I really appreciate that. You have some stuff to read. Now, how did you get involved in skepticism? I know you started off as a cyclist, right? Uh, yeah. Well I was a,

Speaker 2:          00:00:30       a bike racer from 1980 to about 1990, about 10 years in between when I was first in college. I went to pepperdine and then cal state fullerton. And then uh, I just was burned out. I had a master's degree and uh, I just decided I didn't want to do another six straight years of phd work. So I quit and I went over the, a placement office at cal state fullerton and said, well, I need a job. They said, well, can you do? I said nothing. And I'm, I have no skills. I'm a college student but I like to write, so I got a job at a bike magazine, my first job out of college and it was a trade magazine for um, for uh, the bike industry, uh, but I got right into cycling right away about a bike the first week and when you weren't a bike rider before this job.

Speaker 2:          00:01:12       And I went to um, a big event at the Griffith Park where they had a yoplait yogurt 50 kilometer bike race. And Jonathan Boyer was the Big Star. He had the first American to do the Tour de France. And I saw him. It's like, wow, this is a cool sport. So I just got into it. I just started riding and racing and then I did. We started race across America in 1992 in 1982. And so I quit my job and just did that for, for a decade. I had corporate sponsors and we had ABC wide world of sports that contract with them to film it. And we turned it into a little little mini culture business. And you know, ultra and ultra endurance sports were just taking off the iron man. It became famous in the early eighties, John Howard, who won, it was one of the first to do the race across America with me and two other guys and I did a rod dog sled race. And then soon after that, we're all those, um, a sort of long distance mixed sport type things where you run and hike and swim. And, and, uh, anyway, so that was just part of that culture and you know, I was young and single and didn't have a house or mortgage, you know, that stuff. So you can do, do those kinds of things.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       That's a fascinating thing to get into too, because I mean that, that's a real rabbit hole. You get into two when you started into cycling and endurance racing and you, you, you understand the culture and you get into those people there. There are bizarre group of people. They are, yes, actually, uh, the subculture of ultra endurance athletes as a number of Weirdos. But so does the sort of skeptical movement. I've decided that all kind of social subcultures have a handful of real weirdos. The people that show up at your door like, can I stay here this weekend? What? No, you have skeptics that. Because there are also skeptical there. There. There's some oddballs there for sure. That's always going to be the case. I think you're absolutely right. That and about groups

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       you're always going have like outliers or strange strange, but it's all right, but the endurance racing in and of itself, like the idea of pushing your body to the limits is a really fascinating sport because pretty much everyone can ride a bike. It's not like you're doing something like ballet where you. I couldn't imagine doing, you know, I've watched like some people do like flips and gymnastics and stuff and I, although I know the human body can do that. I'm like, yeah, I can't see myself doing it, but I can get on a bike. That's all right. The key is find something you like to do and that you're good at. You know, my wife's a beautiful dancer. I, you know, I've tried to dancing lessons with it. I just can't do it and I just got two left feet. Can't do it. What I meant is though that it's one of those things where a normal person can do it, so to, but to do it the way a Lance Armstrong can do it or the way of Greg Lamon can do it.

Speaker 2:          00:03:48       You get into that weird area where you just tweaking every single aspect of your body, the way you eat, the way you sleep, what you do, your mental attitude, your, your motivation. And did you get down that rabbit hole one? Absolutely. It's all I did, you know, just, you know, it was a 40 hour week but really more like a 60 hour a week job where you're training, but you know, uh, it, it, there's a lot of preparation before you go out on a ride, when you come back from a ride and then you add weights or stretching, yoga, whatever it ends up being, you know, an all day process. How long did it take before you got into all those people that are into epo and blood dope in? When I was raised in the eighties, there was no epo, a blood doping was legal and it was done by people I knew and the 84 Olympics, uh, on the 84 Olympic team, I know some of the people that did it, they used their own blood or a relative's blood.

Speaker 2:          00:04:36       They just stored it and packed it in. It wasn't even band until after the 84 Olympics when it was found out. The American team did it. And then the, uh, the, the, whoever, not that UCI, the Olympic Committee said, okay, no, no blood doping, but it works. I didn't try it. A race across America is kind of a different sort of competition. It's more of you against yourself and the in the clock, you know, you hardly ever see the other people out there on the road. So, um, and I wasn't into the idea of taking your blood out and packing it back in and sort of creeped me out. And there were no drugs that you could take. I mean, things like steroids, it's not going to do it for a cyclist. It the miracle Vpo is that it packs in more red blood cells much faster than say trading at high altitude and uh, and you don't have to do the creepy thing with story and bags of blood and, and then the blood cells die or the blood gets infected.

Speaker 2:          00:05:27       Uh, I mean I got Hep c when I was in college and I had a back surgery. I had a tumor on my spine and I had to have it taken out and I had been taking a lot of aspirin for pain. It was in pain for years and so they had to do this, a blood transfusion in night. This was 1976 and there was no test for this. So I got Hep C. and so after that I thought, oh, blood blood doping packing. That just sort of creeped me out. And there were people that were getting sick from blood doping know you take the blood, you put in a, you store it, maybe it's stored properly, maybe it's not. And then you get blood infections and that's not, that's, that's dangerous is Hep c the disease. That was recently in the news because there was a young guy who owns some pharmaceutical company and they charged a ridiculous amount of money for it.

Speaker 2:          00:06:15       Yes, correct. Because you can get the. I've been cured. Know I'm a kaiser patient and I did it 10 years ago and wiped it out within a month and I did the six month treatment and I've had been clear ever since. But the drugs aren't that expensive if you do it through an Hmo, they just. It's just built into it should be part of your any healthcare system and so yeah, somebody was doctoring the search, cheating the system or something like that. Yeah, there was Jimmy, you know the story behind it, right? That it was a young Martin. Sure. Kelly is that. I think it was Hep c or HIV, I think maybe some different, different medications. He's got a company that works for a lot of pharmaceutical, so it couldn't be both and the accusation once he was price gouging and charging ridiculous. It took you six months to get over a well, my first blood test after a month of taking the, the antiviral and the interferon was the combination would they use 10 years ago and within the first blood test it was gone.

Speaker 2:          00:07:11       Undetectable. They said, yeah, but you got to do the whole six month treatment. That's our program. All right. So I did it. Uh, I was one of the fortunate ones that didn't get sick from the drugs. Some people just are laid out, they can't, they can't do exercise or function, but I didn't have any problems. So you tested negative but they still made you continue the medication? Yeah. Is it because just because you're in a sort of a trials and it's like this is what we do. You've got to do the six months. So. All right. Oh, okay. But he didn't mess with, you know, that was all right. Yep. So, you know, back then, um, that was the only thing you could do with was blood doping when epo was introduced in the early nineties, that really made a big difference. And as you know, Greg, I first discovered this when his teammates came to him a and said, you know, we found out these other guys are doing this stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:07:57       We got to get on the program and he didn't want to do it. And so by the time Lance got into the sport, you know, he didn't invent doping. I mean, it was already ramping in, it was full on cold coal, full coal. And only land stayed was like, well, well, if everybody's doing it, we're going to do it. We might as well do it at a really professional level. And uh, you know, that's, that's where he sort of took it to another level and who knows if it's still going on. Yeah. I had him on the podcast and I watched it. Yeah, it was, it was very enlightening. Um, I like him a lot. You know, he's an extreme winter and extreme winters are there. They are the type of people that they just push everything to the outmost edge. And that guy, if everybody.

Speaker 2:          00:08:36       I've firmly believed that if everybody was 100 percent natural, there was the same results, probably would have had probably. Yeah, probably would have been different numbers as far as like the times achieved. But I think he's still probably would have won it. Probably. Yes, probably. Probably is a bit. It's a big word, right? Well, and this is, this is why it's still in a moral act because there are people that don't do it or they don't want to do it and we'll never know how they would've done compared to the people that are doping. And um, uh, but again, uh, uh, probably we know that all of the other people that were on the podium with lance for those seven years, they all had been busted for dopey or admitted that they doped up. So the outcome, you know, how far down do you go to give the Jersey and did 127th place guy or something because we know so many of them were doing it.

Speaker 2:          00:09:21       It's just so fascinating to me from a perspective of these guys are essentially experimenting with their bodies. Trying to find the right levels, trying to find out what's the best method to do so and along the entire, you know, the career that lance had, you see all these adjustments that these people are making and been trying to. Well, one of the early books at before all this came out about land. So it was called breaking the chain by Willie who was a, um, a sworn your or you know, one of the people who give massage therapies to a or. No, I think it was one of the mechanics anyway, with, with the uh, uh, Festina team. They got busted in [inaudible] 98 and he said basically these guys were just experimenting randomly. No one knew what to do. What's the dosage? How many days, every other day. How do I incorporate the other things I'm doing?

Speaker 2:          00:10:08       What about food training? It was just, you know, Katy bar the door. Let's just try anything. So again, one of the things lance did was hire the best doctor. This mckelly Ferrari. Know the business you got to knew the most about how to do it properly and adjust it for each body. Because everybody's body is different. Okay, so we're gonna try it, you know, you do this for months before the big race and figure it out and other people weren't doing that. And then by the time they scrambled to catch up, tyler talks about this in his book, you know, after he left the postal team and got his own team and then of course Ferrari wasn't available. So we hired this other guy flint days who screwed up and mix the bags of blood and gave him the wrong drug. And he got. He got popped, he said for what?

Speaker 2:          00:10:51       He was doping, but he got popped for somebody else's dope. Oh, because someone else's blood was in the system, correct? Right. I think that's what it was. And and really vote talks about this and breaking the chain to about one of the guys that, one of the early guys that got busted. He. Oh, he used his mechanics urine for the urine test, which you store it in a little condom that's held underneath this little fake penis called the wizard. Oh, I've seen that because at the drug test you have to look and watch the Ip because just to make sure so you, you do it in a way. Just what the problem was that the mechanic had stayed up all night working on the bikes and took some stimulants. Stimulants are in the year and so this poor guy gets busted for something. He didn't take course he was taking something else.

Speaker 2:          00:11:35       Oh yeah. There's horror stories about this guy's putting bags of blood on the hook on the, in the hotel room on the wall where the painting is that it drips down into your, you know, it's like, no, this is, this is, you know, really a, a barbaric system when they, in the early days when they were experimenting. Uh, so again went lance did was just take it to another level since it's going on anyway. We might as well do it professionally. Okay. And he would have gotten away with it because had he stayed retired, but back to where you started, it's, you know, when you're at that level and you push your body every day and you get all the endorphins and the testosterone and the camaraderie with the guys. It, it's great. It is so fun. I still ride four or five days a week with the guys that I used to race with and friends in the area here and I, you know, if I missed three or four days a week traveling, I'm just crawling out of my skin.

Speaker 2:          00:12:25       I just got to get back on. Wow, that's interesting. Yeah. And I'm 62 years old, so imagine your lance and you have the highest competitive edge, probably anybody and, and you're a super athlete and super gifted and then you're push, push, push, and then you've got those seven straight and then you retire. And then what? Golf. Yeah. It doesn't have the same intensity. And so I completely understand why so many of these guys come back. Remember, Brett Farve came back a couple of times and uh, you know, it's just hard to, to, to break that habit. Yeah, I see it all the time with fighters. Unfortunately we're, the consequences are much graver, you know, when you're older and your body doesn't respond the same way and you've already taken a lot of damage, but yet you still have this Jonesing for the spotlight and see them come back.

Speaker 2:          00:13:09       I mean, they all have done it yet. Sugar Ray, Leonard, Alia down the line and a lot of MMA fighters have done it as well. It's just, it's so, it's the life, you know, you know, you get Monday morning, I'm gonna do this workout, I eat this and it's just a great pattern to be and it feels great. You're working toward this goal in six months or this is going to happen. And then when that goal is gone, it's like, well, why? Why am I getting up at six in the morning to this? I mean, I like doing that, but I got to have a reason. I mean, Atlanta stayed retired, probably be governor of Texas by now probably right? So, uh, yeah, but, uh, I mean he was so beloved when he was doing the live strong foundation and the whole deal of trying to help people with cancer and, you know, his own struggle overcoming cancer.

Speaker 2:          00:13:51       It's just such a crazy story. Well, and it really, the, the meltdown, was it part of that Omerta rule and it works if, if everyone has something to lose. The problem was, was um, Floyd Landis, you know, he, he got popped for the, his victory in the 2006 Tour de France for doping, which he was. And so he served his two years after a long struggle of denial and so forth. And then he wanted to come back and he, and, and he couldn't get hired. And then he went to lance and said, well, you know, can I be on the radio shack team? And apparently lance said no. And so there he is standing there with nothing, nothing to lose. So that's when he went to the press and said, you know, I know where the bodies are buried. And uh, you know, that's where it got bad.

Speaker 2:          00:14:36       Remember that when that happened and Lance Hill, that press conference, you know, we like our story better than his story. It's like wait stories. He's got to start with just what happened and uh, you know, so, uh, and same thing with tyler, you know, he had nothing left to lose. So he, that book the secret race, here's what we did and uh, that blew it all open. So how do you get into skepticism from there? Well, I was still teaching college at night while I was doing the bike race and stuff. And uh, then I, I got burnout, you know, just the training and all that and decide, okay, I can't do this forever. So I went back and got my phd in the history of science and uh, and then I started, I was teaching at Occidental College and I was like, okay, I'm a college professor.

Speaker 2:          00:15:17       That's a great gig. Uh, it's a good life. Uh, but, but then we started in my garage, skeptic magazine and the lecture series at Caltech on science and pseudoscience and cults and science and religion and alternative medicine and quackery and all this stuff. And, and I thought that that's an interesting niche to have and, and so that just got bigger and bigger. And my first book, uh, white people believe where things came out in [inaudible] 97 and at about that time, Occidental college is going through a financial crisis and they were letting go their adjuncts, which at the time I was not on a tenure track, I was a full time adjunct and I could see the writing on the wall, okay, this may not end up being a tenure track job. And the skeptic thing was getting big and I got a big contract through my agent for my second book.

Speaker 2:          00:16:01       So I thought, okay, I'm just going to go for it. I'm going to be a full time writer. And it's a little risky. But I had already done the risky thing of, you know, just dropping everything and doing the race across America steps. I thought, okay, I can do it. And this then became really my job. I still teach one class a semester at Chapman, but my main job is writing books and running the society, a publishing the magazine skeptic. And it's kind of a niche market of a, it's like my column in scientific American. I cover the topics in there that aren't covered in the rest of the magazine, like cancer quackery or like I'm working on one now on a Charlie Sheen's a quack cancer doctor is aids doctor. I mean, he's got a quack cancer or aids. Uh, it's eight, sorry. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:16:47       Uh, he, you know, he is tiger blood and all that, you know. Well, he doesn't have tiger. There's no tiger blood. Okay. So he got HIV and so he immediately went on the drug cocktail, which works, you know, this is a miracle of modern medicine that kind of just sort of slipped by without anybody making a big fuss about it, you know, t huge teams of medical researchers and they figured out the right cocktail and then you adjust it for each person and you can, you can't get rid of the HIV virus, but you'd knock it down so much that it can't, it doesn't cause the aids, um, symptoms. You get pneumonia or whatever. And, and so, um, so he did that. But then, much to my amazement, he, uh, uh, Bill Maher on his show a couple of weeks ago, I had this guy on this guy from Mexico who has this cure for aids.

Speaker 2:          00:17:34       And, uh, if you take this, um, the blood of an arthritic goat, so a goat that has arthritis, how they determined, I'm not sure that's allegedly charlie, went to Mexico and, and did the, the arthritic goat's blood treatment and it cured his aides. Well, none of this is true. Uh, he stopped the drug cocktail. He went down there and stop the normal drug cocktail for AIDS HIV and it came roaring back. Of course, if you don't keep taking the drugs, the virus starts multiplying and it roars back in your body. The goat, the goat blood didn't work. And then he came home and went back on the drug cocktail and he's fine now. So he went down there to actually do this. He went down there to do this. Well, because he was probably told, well, he's probably scared. I don't know. But, uh, this is what I understand.

Speaker 2:          00:18:24       If there's already a drug cocktail that absolutely works, why would you want to stay just to prevent the aids symptoms from coming on from you getting the diseases you still had the HIV virus like magic knock it down to an almost undetectable level. Yeah, that's correct. And that's should be good enough. Well that's what Magic Johnson. So it doesn't even show up in this. That's right, right. Like if he gets tested right now he's HIV positive or a negative. Right? Right. That's right. Yup. Even though they don't guarantee it just in case it's hiding in the nooks and crannies of your nervous system or wherever. Um, so, um, yeah, so that's, you know, that's the kind of thing that scientific American would normally cover, but we would cover or conspiracy theories like the nine slash 11 truth is, you know, uh, what about the free fall of the buildings and the puffs of smoke and the this and that.

Speaker 2:          00:19:10       You know, some of these are empirical questions we can get at that, that normal science journals wouldn't cover that we cover. So skeptic has kind of a niche market for fringe claims. Borderlands claims, you know, like, like scientific American deals a lot with global climate change, but they don't deal with the global warming deniers. Who are these people, what are their arguments? So we would take on that and go, okay, here's their 10 arguments, the best arguments they have, and then here's the answers of how we know global warming is real, how do you know it's human cause how do we know these things are normal science journalists don't have to deal with that. They are already down the path. And I'm like okay, what are we going to do about it? And that sort of thing. So that's kind of our specialty. Well it's an important resource because whether it's global warming or nine slash 11 truther and there's just, there's so much confusion out there when it comes to trying to figure out what's real and what's not real.

Speaker 2:          00:19:59       Someone sends you a link, you know like what is this? And it's a youtube video. You go to the youtube, you are being lied to. What the Hell is going on? What you don't know what's going on. And then you watch it, like global warming is just one of the many ones that, uh, that confuse the shit out of people. And then, you know, then you find out that there's companies that actually have a vested interest in confusing people. Like, have you ever seen that documentary merchants of doubt? I'm in it. Oh, that's right. Yes. I'm in it. Yeah. I asking you that many documentaries officially to that, the beauty of that, a film made by a candidate that is now a friend of mine. It was very clever because, um, he tracked down the same scientists who were hired by the tobacco companies. Not just the same arguments, you know, planting a seed.

Speaker 2:          00:20:47       Some of the times the same people paid by these front groups and they'd know how to do it through. It's so theatrical the way they present their arguments. It's one of the reasons why I've always hated those. Those tough television shows where you have a, you know, a, a host, and then you have the split window. One person talking over them on this side and one person is on the left, one person isn't the right, literally and figuratively. Right? They're yelling at each other and you never get anything done. You never figured out anything. But the person who's better at expressing that opinion in a real quick, you know, three or four minute soundbite of interview, they get their argument across and that's what these merchants of doubt guys were doing. That's right. Yep. They got the sound bites. Uh, the science is not all in the jury is still out.

Speaker 2:          00:21:30       What jury, where you know it. It's almost like there's a science are that calls all the shots. And if we can just find out what's going on there, we're going to put us, you know, we're going to blow this stuff that isn't how it works. There's 10,000 climate scientists working in all these labs and their findings converge to the same conclusion. So for there to be conspiracy, they'd all have to be meeting on the weekends going, okay, I'm going to say that the, you know, the parts per million of this particular gas is this, what are you going to say? This is not how it works. It's a very competitive enterprise. If you want to make a name for yourself and you're a young scientist just debunking one of these arguments about tree ring data or the ice core data, which would be huge. And they try it, you know, it's like the people saying, you know, Einstein was wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:22:13       Well, okay, there's been 100 years of scientists testing Einstein. If he was wrong, we would know by now, oh no, they all, they're all conspiring to cover the truth. No, that isn't how it works. There's also this appeal or this, this, this. For some reason people are drawn to this idea of being a no nonsense person. You know the no nonsense person. You believe in Al Gore, you believe that you have, if you've seen an inconvenient truth and then. But I find that when I talked to these people that like really dismiss global climate change or dismiss a lot of people's concerns about those things, they haven't really researched it that much. There so definitive on their ideas, but they haven't really researched it that much, but they don't want to be a fool. That seems to be a lot of the appeal to them to take this hard stance.

Speaker 2:          00:23:04       It's like they don't want to be one of those fools. What do you hippie? Yeah. By buy of that nonsense. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it, it's partly that, like one of the appeals of conspiracy theories is, you know, we're going to blow the lid off and I'm not being fooled by the, I know the Bush administration light and as yet. And we're going to. Yeah. So I mean that's one of the appeals of the nine slash 11 truth movement is that, you know, we know what really happened and, and you know, Bush lied, okay, well maybe lied about this little thing or maybe it was misdirection or get bad information. But the idea of orchestrating an entire event like nine slash 11 and coordinating the flying of the planes into buildings and you know, what did they do with the passengers and how did get the people into the World Trade Center buildings to break open the drywall and plant the explosive devices without anybody noticing how many thousands of people would have to be involved.

Speaker 2:          00:23:55       You think the federal government could pull it off? Something like that when they couldn't even do Watergate. I mean, here it's just a hotel. Break it. I forgot to bring in a book for. You. Damn it. I have a doctorate. He's sort of a doctor is really a weed doctor is a doctor that prescribes my medical marijuana. I get headaches. Getting one right now. Anyway, he gave me this book when I went to visit him and it was a book about Tesla Technology that was used to take down the twin towers. Oh, I don't know this sitting in the doctor's office, boy. Oh, he's fucking telling me about this technology. That what, what, what, what? Have you ever seen the turns concrete into dust, right? Well, you know, concretes, it starts out as powder talking about millions of tons of, of a building that's compressed and falling down. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:24:44       I would imagine there'd be a bunch of dust for awhile. Thermite was the big thing there. Might will melt the. Okay. So then there were tests done and the thermite and it doesn't burn hot enough to get through a whole huge beam. Okay. Well they have I think just cut through an engine block with that stuff though, right? Yeah. But these beams are like, you know, the size of this table, but if it had a lot of thermite well but. So then they say, well it's super thermite. Well it's like, well where is this super thermal? I never heard of it. Well it's secret super secret. Super thermite pieces of evidence that they were using or like the cuts, the angular cuts on the beams. Well that was actually done after the buildings had color. Right. They were trying to clean it up. They had to cut some of them down and so they were using these photos.

Speaker 2:          00:25:28       So there was a lot of confusion. Okay, you sit. But the thing is, you don't need to know anything about thermite or tesla technology. We know that the planes hit the buildings. You can see it on video, you could see which floors they were at, the angle of the wings and so forth for that to have happened. And explosive devices planted at the exact floors where they knew ahead of time what floors and what angle. The plane right there stop. Full Stop, you know, that can't be well, it's very, very, very unlikely. Super Unlikely not to mention a g Gordon Liddy once told me about Watergate, the, you know, the competency problem and the, and the people can't keep their mouth shut problem, you know, uh, the more people you have involved, the more they're going to screw up or chicken out or change their mind or then tell their friends and lovers and so forth.

Speaker 2:          00:26:19       You know, I know the guy that did it and pretty soon they're on your show telling about what they saw Haka. No one's come out to say, you know, I was sitting there in my office and I saw these guys breaking through the dry wall. And putting these things inside that you know, so I mean someone like Jesse Ventura thing, so it was all done under the cover of a, of a fixing the elevators in the world trade center, fixing the elevators. I mean this would have had to gone for weeks and weeks and I don't

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       know if Jesse Ventura really believes that. He says this, he's selling conspiracy. Now I have A. There's a bunch of people that conspiracy becomes a business and like Alex Jones, who's a friend of mine and he's out of his fucking mind. I know he believes this stuff. Or does he just say stuff? Just to see what comes out. He believes a lot, but he gets a lot of things right. That's what's unfortunate. The unfortunate thing about conspiracies is that it's not all cut and dry. There was things like operation northwoods where the government really did plan on orchestrating these artificial attacks, arming Cuban friendlies a bay. They're going to blow up a jetliner and blaming on Cuba. There were real actual conspiring or con conspiracies that we can prove. This is the problem with the nine slash 11. Truth is, or the extreme conspiracy theories, they're missing where the real action is, you know, all those third world dictators we were supporting in the seventies under Kissinger and Nixon, all real.

Speaker 1:          00:27:44       This stuff happened and that's it. It's not as sexy as, you know, taking over the world are running the world economy, but it's, it's real and it's affected over in north. I mean, remember that, I mean the, when, when that was going on with the ads, that conspiracy, that's a real conspiracy. There's a real, there's real ones, you know. And then there was a real one that was apparently being planned by Dick Cheney on the way out. You know, they were planning on doing something with Iran. They were planning on some sort of a false flag. But when people look at operation northwoods and they look at that where it would have cost American lives, they had a real conspiracy that President Kennedy vetoed. That was actually signed by the Joint Chiefs of staff that gets, it gets the Bay of pigs. That was a conspiracy. Yeah. So there, there have been real conspiracy, right?

Speaker 1:          00:28:25       So they look at nine slash 11, they go, this is the grand one, the big one, right? So how can we tell the difference between the real ones that. Well, okay, well, so there's certain criteria. Again, the grander the theory is, the less likely it is a real conspiracy, global domination running the world's economy, these sorts of things. Well, how about the big Alex Jones one? They want to cut the population down to like 500 million people worldwide. Yeah. Well that, that could, that could happen naturally if we just, uh, uh, educated women made them economically empowered and had access to birth control, you know, that's the solution to they overpopulation. You really think that would work. People still want babies. Well, they do, yes, of course. But the replacement level, there are a number of countries below the replacement level and we know what the factors are, the things I just said, you know, just being, being a prosperous democracy in which women had the franchise and they're economically empowered and educated and they have access to birth control. Family planning happens naturally. You don't have to do the China one child rule, you don't have to do that. It happens naturally. So if you're, if you're a pro life, so called pro life and you're against abortion, that and you want to reduce the amount of abortions, just educate women and giving them power and give them choice and access to birth control and it happens naturally. Yeah, that's a weird statistic, isn't

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       it? That the more prosperous cities become, the more the civilization becomes advanced as far as like education and technology.

Speaker 2:          00:29:50       You get less birth rate. That's right. So it's [inaudible] Uzi and malthus was wrong. And, and, and Paul Ehrlich with the population bomb wrong and they're still modern. Neil Matthews that are claiming this today, you know, the club of Rome, the limits of growth and all this stuff. No, no, no. Uh, if you want to get a population lower, just make the people super prosperous, especially the women. And it just happens naturally. And the reason is because one reason people have so many babies in poor countries is because they're not likely to survive the debate. The babies die. And so you got to have lots of them to get your jeans out there, so to speak. So it's sort of a biological impulse. And then also to take care of you when you're old, you better, you better have six or 10 just to make sure there's a couple left when year old to support you. You don't need to do any of that when you have a prosperous economy. The effect

Speaker 3:          00:30:42       though is it's so scary as far as the overpopulation effect, when we look at the raw numbers from like 1970 versus 2016 worldwide, but it's not that long ago in our lifetime while I was alive, the population has more than doubled. And in the United States, just in the United States. And forget about poor countries. We've got about China. Forget about India, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:31:03       Yes, correct. Correct. So there's, you know, as the population pig works its way through the python demographic, python, it's going to take a while to catch up. So already country, there's a number of countries that are below replacement level, but what countries are below that? Well, Japan, Sweden, Russia. Uh, I don't know. There's at least a dozen in mostly northern European countries and that means that their population is still growing by the momentum of past decades, but the current generation will have, you know, one point nine children on average. Two point one is the replacement level and I forget how many kinds of 20 something countries are below two point one replacement level, but it'll take till about 20 slash 50 before we see the topping off of the population growth and then start to go back down. It's one reason you almost never see the curves after 20 slash 50 because if you're a pro environmentalist or pr pro, anti population organization, you don't want to show the good news from 2050 to 2100, but the UN two of the three you and projections, they have like a conservative middle and in and then I'm more radical projections and that by 2100, the modest middle one shows us back down to around probably six or 7 billion from will hit a peak of nine or 10 billion in 2050 back down to where we are now in 2100.

Speaker 2:          00:32:21       And then by 2100, maybe one or 2 billion, if, if, Yep, it could down to one or two that this could happen just by if. I mean there's so many variables, it's hard to predict, but that could happen if everybody is prosperous, particularly Africa. So one of the things the gates foundation is trying to do is just solve certain basic,

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       simple problems. And, and the UN is trying to get rid of these corrupt governments. That's what's holding them back. There's enough food to feed 7 billion people. It's the distribution. That's the problem. The Green Revolution, Norman Borlaug and the green revolution salt, you know, we have the technology to do at Gmos are good for feeding poor people. I'm a sub, but it's the corrupt dictatorships that prevent the distribution of the food and resources and keeps the population from being prosperous so they have more children. So that, in my opinion, that's the longterm solution. So there's two things there. One, there's the conspiracy by the elites to hide the fact that we're going to get down to 2 billion people by 2100. We got that. Well, it's the environmentalist, they're hiding it hit, we don't know for sure this is going to happen. These are projections, but then there's also the food distribution, a conversation, which is a very fascinating one.

Speaker 1:          00:33:35       You know, I had these guys on from the documentary cowspiracy, which is well intended, but apparently got a bunch of stuff wrong about how many acres it takes to have a cow graze, like how much I'm going to, what are the requirements and what you can do with veganism versus what it was. Essentially they were really heavily biased and promoting a vegan lifestyle, which is their choice. You know, they could do that, but that's the big argument today. It's like, do we have enough land? Do we have enough resources to feed all the people? My conversation has always been like, okay, are we doing it right now? Yes, we're all eating right, especially the United States. Okay, well you know, we are running out of land. We are running out of food. We are running out of this. The Sky is falling, but are okay. Are we doing it right now?

Speaker 1:          00:34:20       Are we feeding ourselves right now? We are right, you are really easily, in fact, problem. We have a surplus, plenty of food. Not to say that a lot of the methods we're using aren't disgusting. Like factory farming. Farming is terrible, horrible and the, and then a lot of laws to protect them or disgusting to like the Ag gag laws. Those are viable, but why can't we keep doing it? And then then the argument kind of falls apart. Well we were gonna we're gonna run out of stuff. Well, okay. So in the long run we want to get off the factory farming. It is according to disgusting habit. And the poly farms, you know, the happy, I call them the happy farms, you know, wherever Joel Salatin, every cow has a name and there's the happy chicken running around. Yeah, that gets killed that yeah, he has a great life until that last day.

Speaker 1:          00:35:06       So yeah, those kinds of farms cannot support 7 billion people. So in the long run we have to get the numbers down somewhat. And also the technology of synthetic meat, we just getting there. It's a, you know, I think we're not five years away. I think, you know, we're, we're maybe a couple of decades away. You don't think it's possible to get a significant number of the people in this country to go vegan? No, I don't think that's gonna happen in the moral arc. I have a chapter on animal rights in which I show that the numbers are still in single digits or even with all the environmental movement and all the, you

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       know, vegetarian, pro, vegetarian. It's still less than 10 percent. It's more like six or seven percent of the population, the population in the United States. And so I liked the reduce attarian movements and new word reduce attarian let's just, you know, meatless Mondays just just cut it down and try to, you know, if you shop at whole foods, you know, get the happy farm meat, you know, that sort of thing. Um, you know, obviously if you can afford a whole foods, I know it's not okay. So in the long run, you know, markets will drive down prices of say a synthetic meat. Right now, you know, a little patty made out of stem cells is thousand dollars, but you know, that course, that's what computers were in the forties. And so now look, and then this will happen, but not in five years or 10 years. And so the idea of like, well in the meantime, let's get everybody to go vegan.

Speaker 2:          00:36:27       This isn't also isn't going to happen. Why you, why don't you think it's going to happen? Uh, I think first of all, we, we have a habit of eating meat. It tastes great. Most people like it. Uh, you, you can get your protein from other sources. I don't think that's a viable argument anymore, but, but most people, they just like it and it's culturally has still has a lot of momentum. I think it's one thing to get people to care about global warming or yeah, let's drive electric cars, whatever. You don't have to give up something that, that you really, really like, but food, people really like their meat. And uh, I, I, I would be okay if everybody went that way, but I'm not quite there yet myself. I still have meat now and then, but I've, I've reduced it considerably compared to before was the ethical considerations of the reason why people think that it's a good way to go and not, not necessarily protein wise or.

Speaker 2:          00:37:16       I mean there's, there's a, there's a bunch of people that argue that the, it's very difficult to get the same amount of protein, but then there's also people that argue that you really don't need the amount of protein the most people consume anyway. Right. Well, you can try to change behavior. Okay. Nudge people with incentives, but why not also go the path of the technological solutions, synthetic meat, you know, people are working on this, there are companies doing it, you know, funded by a venture capitalists in Google. One of the google x projects is to do this. Again, I think it's, you know, it's maybe it's like self driving cars know it's just, it's going to take a few decades before everybody is there, but I'm optimistic because we're at least moving in that direction. Yeah. I think that's a real possibility of headless animals that we've engineered and the labs and that's where we get our food from. But what will it be as good for you? Well, it tastes as good. Well that a principle that should just be a scientific western. Right? We know what, what's in inmate. Okay. So just put it in there. And your synthetic meat, just design it with your designer jeans, I guess. I mean, but there's a big difference between cows that eat certain diets versus cows eat grass fed cows versus health wise. As far as the, uh, there was a study that was released recently showing the benefits of grass fed beef versus

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       corn fed beef just health wise. Yep. Yep. So, you know, I don't know. We'll see. Yeah. Because I'm curious. I mean if they do create synthetic meat, will, will it have the same properties? I, I would imagine you could even build in marbling, just put fat cells in there to make it juicy or something. And maybe that won't be as healthy, but maybe you think, well I don't care. Yeah. But I would be, you know, I mean, there's a difference between the way it tastes like a marble, like a fat from a grass fed cow versus the fat from a corn fed cow versus a fat from a lab built cow going to be yet it's also just habit of what you used to. I love red meat, but I almost never eat it anymore. I really don't miss it. Uh, you just kind of get into the pattern of change in your diet and it, I think, I think we could get there.

Speaker 1:          00:39:24       I just don't think that that's the only avenue to solving the factory farming problem. I think lowering the population, synthetic meat, changing behavior, just come at it from a bunch of different angles. Um, that's of the case with every problem, right? Absolutely. So I call that, I call it in the moral of that Protopian solutions. Uh, Kevin Kelly, the founder of wired magazine, he used this term protopia small changes, tiny little bit of progress. It's like last year's nab system, uh, and this year's Nav system in your car, this one slightly better. It has this little feature and this little thing, you know, and, and over many years and decades, all of a sudden you've got a super smart car versus the Jalopies of the fifties, not a flying car. You don't go from, you know, the Jalopy to the flying car and one year you go to what we have now incrementally.

Speaker 1:          00:40:08       And that's true in all technologies. You know, it's like the Mac just keeps, you know, I've been buying Max for, you know, 25 years. He since the late eighties and it's a 30 and a, it's the same pay, the same price. You have to, you got 2,400 bucks, you get pretty much the same. Double the computer for the same price every three years. And that's what most technologies go through. Yeah. Well I think that's one of the cool things about following it. You know, one of the things that's so fascinating to me about following technology is like woo, Samsung has the new galaxy s nine. It's waterproof and it can show the moon these days are there. They're so interesting to see where this innovation is going and when the innovation is, you know, when it's things like mean essentially I've made the argument that the view leaf cell phones alone, if everyone's making cell phones right now, so let's just make the same cell phone forever.

Speaker 1:          00:40:57       We're good. You know, you have an iphone six s leave it there. We don't need any more innovation. Let's use that for, for other things mean we'd probably be pretty happy. We'd be all right. But you know, that's not how companies working now, but we're fascinated by innovation. We actually, I'm a little mad at apple right now because the new o s system, I lost half my music. I don't know where it went and I haven't taken the time to figure out how to get it back. And what do you mean? Oh, it's not on your phone and the cloud he has. They're encouraging use of the cloud. Yeah, yeah. You could say guys, whatever. It was great. Just okay, but that that mean there

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       is a lot of nonsense that they do when they update things, but that's also because they're trying to build in new features and their planning several steps ahead for the future. They want everything to be in the cloud, which is kind of weird. Another thing, electric cars, I think you go to the Petersen Museum here and you see electric cars in the 19 twenties happened, conspiracy kind of oil companies, tire company. You ever see the documentary who killed the electric car? Absolutely. Yeah. It's like we should have. We should be there now. You should have been there decades ago then about the fact that Henry Ford's first car, the fenders were made out of hemp and you know that. I've never seen it. No. I'll show you a video of them because it's really fascinating and pull up Henry Ford first car hamp. They used hemp fibers too, by the way, was legal back then know it wasn't illegal until they came up with a thing called the decorticator, which will allow them to effectively process hemp fiber.

Speaker 3:          00:42:28       That's when William Randolph hearst started this propaganda against hemp. That was era. Yeah. That's how marijuana became illegal. It had nothing to do with the drug. The psychoactive aspect of it had to do with the the textiles and using it as paper and using it as a commodity. That's when it became illegal and it was all hearst. William Randolph hearst was a motherfucker. Really? Yeah. So this car is actually made out of hemp. The fenders and Lotus did one recently where they had an exposed hood. But what's interesting about this, we see it a Henry Ford, I don't know if it's this video, but he hit it. He hit him with a hammer. Oh Wow. I mean incredibly durable. Hemp is an amazing, amazing plant. I don't know if you've ever picked up a hemp stock, but it's incredibly hard, but really light, like very, very different than any other would like.

Speaker 3:          00:43:16       It's hard like a walnut. Right? But it's light like a Balsa Wood. It's very, very strange. It's a very unusual car. Pull up the Lotus because it was real recent, like last year to my car. Exactly. It would bend like crazy. It's lighter and stronger than steel, which is insane. Right. And you know, the whole thing with how to drugs become illegal. That's a kind of a concern, you know, sort of a conspiracy is a real conspiracy because hemp is non psychoactive. The fact that it's still illegal. I mean they're just now starting to grow it in America. We sell him my company on it sells hemp protein, which is legal. Non-Psychoactive doesn't have any thc in it. We had a buyer from Canada. Really see this right here. This is the new, um, Lotus that is the entire roof if they show it and see if you could find a picture where they show the actual car itself, Jamie, but it's a, these, all these panels are made out of hemp and like it's insanely light.

Speaker 3:          00:44:11       Yeah. But if you show the actual car itself, Jamie, you can see maybe go to the front, the, the beginning of the video. You could see the actual hood of the car. It's exposed. Okay. So they may, they essentially made a giant percentage of the car out of hemp, including the seats that looks, that looks lighter than carbon fibers. Hey, I wonder if anyone's made a hemp bicycle. That's a good question because that, you know, that's the whole thing about carbon fibers. So lightweight but strong. So if what you were saying about him is true, there should be heavy bikes on a lot of other light things like bows and things along those lines. I think that, uh, that's a real conspiracy conspiracy back, Wayne. There's a reason why, you know, Orson Welles made that movie citizen Kane Bout William Randolph hearst and insanely, insanely powerful and influential man who didn't really use that influence in the best way for society.

Speaker 3:          00:45:01       Did it Tuesday he had paper mills and he didn't want to convert his paper into hemp paper and paper was far superior, but it would have cost them millions of dollars because he had forests and so popular science magazine back then and see if he could find this color. It was a hemp, the new billion dollar crop. A bicycle from him. There you go. Done. Yeah, that's a good looking bike. Okay. Yeah, there you go. I have a carbon fiber bike. Maybe I'll have to start looking at that. Yeah, I don't know where you buy one of those. Um, why is there no thc in the hip, in the, a female plants in the, in the flower. Okay. It's in the flower buds. That's the female is the one you get high off of the mail, but your, which one is the stock of it? You're not looking for flowers, so when you're using it to make things right, but uh, the seeds but hemp, it's on the cover of the, uh, of popular science from like way back then it looks like about 19 thirties or forties.

Speaker 3:          00:46:00       Yeah, well I believe it was, I want to say 30. It was 33 or something like that, or 35 when it was made illegal. And uh, they made it illegal and they were calling it marijuana, which is really interesting. Which is a slang for a Mexican wild tobacco. It's not even cannabis. So when they were making marijuana illegal, they didn't even know that they were making hemp illegal. It was very tricky the way they did it. They, they made these articles, they printed all these articles about Mexicans and blacks raping white women because they were high on this new drug. Right. That's also what funded reefer madness, which I'm sure you've seen it all those. Those are real conspiracies. Absolutely. And that's people that had a vested financial interest in making something illegal, a commodity. It's so crazy because the fact that marijuana or the cannabis plant is so versatile, it, there's so many different things.

Speaker 3:          00:46:52       They figured out a way to attack one aspect of it and demonize the entire plant and then eliminate competition right now because it makes a far superior paper, far superior cloth. It's like incredibly durable. Like the paper, if you ever had hemp paper in front of you, it feels like a regular piece of paper, but it's really hard to tear. It's a really interesting job. Money out of that. Exactly. Well, what do they make money out of now? Well, it's in fiber. Yeah. Yeah. So, well, and there's, there was a documentary on about the, uh, public transportation system here in La that was quite extensive at the thirties with the, you know, electric, electric trolleys and this stuff and

Speaker 2:          00:47:29       they all got ripped out and torn down and the cars were burned and so on, just because the automobile industry and the oil industry wanted it, you know, it's like La should be a car down entire country, should be a car culture rather than a public transportation culture. My wife's from Cologne, Germany, public transportation in Europe is fantastic. You really don't need a car for except for rare occasions here when she moved here to be with me. It's like, oh, got to have a car. He can't get anywhere. And uh, again, that's kind of a conspiracy and that's, those are the kinds of things we should be focusing on. And talking about. Uh, I think the war on drugs, I mean, I don't call it a conspiracy, but you know, it's over. It's been over for decades.

Speaker 3:          00:48:10       That's, it's also so blatant that it's only the war on some drugs. Yes. It's not like we're trying to keep everyone's sober, we're just gonna sell sanctioned drugs that have tax codes, you know, and that's, that's really what the war is on drugs that you can't control and tax and it's so blatant and obvious, right? It might not treat it like an industry, like any alcohol industry. Sure, absolutely. Yep. Like alcohol, alcohol's, and unbelievably devastating drug and readily available almost everywhere. We've got enough in that back room to kill you. If you want to kill yourself. Drink right now while the show was going on. We went in the next hour, you'll be dead. It'll be amazing. Yeah. That's amazing. And mentally and no one cares. Like everybody would go, wow. Michael Shermer drank himself to death. Oh, poor guy. You know what I mean? It's not like, Oh man, he did drugs and he had an old.

Speaker 3:          00:48:59       Wow, that's so tragic. Drugs are awful, right? While they're everywhere, every street you go down, you pass by liquor stores and restaurants that sell just molecules in your brain and your body. Uh, so what's the difference? Well, there's an, there's absolutely real legitimate conspiracies and I do agree with you that those are the ones to focus on, but they're not sexy, sexy ones or Ufo or bigfoot. Yeah, that kind of stuff. Yep. Global diamond. Yes. I did this show for the Scifi channel called Joe Rogan questions. Everything around her that. Yes. Yeah. I went around and I talked to experts, believers, nonbelievers, scientists, all these different people about a bunch of different subjects and boy, my desire to do that show before I started doing it was very high and my desire to completely avoid any, any of that nonsense towards the end of the show was it was almost like I couldn't do it anymore because I had already recognized what was going on in so many of these cases that I was like, this is just a bunch of people that want to believe they have these ideas in their head and they want to chase these ideas down, whether it's big foot or whether it's UFO and they're not being objective even remotely.

Speaker 3:          00:50:12       The vast majority of the people that are a part of the movement or the community that like researches, ghosts or research is bigfoot or researchers. Nice people. They're not that, but the way they're looking at it right is the same. It's the same whether it's bigfoot

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       or chem trails or Ufo or they. They're not. They're not being objective. They're going, well, maybe this. What about that? We'll have we considered this? Nope. They're just going. We know the evidence is out there. The government has been hiding extra terrestrial life in this country. Like where, where, where's the government? Where's, where's the government doing this? Where's the evidence? We know from surveys that if you tick the box that you believe in aliens or whatever, you'll tick all the boxes. Psychics. Exactly the whole thing. Yeah. So there's a certain personality that gravitates toward those kinds of beliefs and then, and then buys the whole thing. Even when their contract, they contradict each other, like people that were, uh, that believed that Princess di was murdered. Also are morally inclined to say she faked her death and is still alive somewhere. She was hanging out with Tupac.

Speaker 2:          00:51:10       Yeah, they can't both be true, but again, there's, so with this, there's some cognitive dissonance that we want a balance between the size of the event and the size of the cars. So I think, uh, you know, the Holocaust, one of the worst thing that's ever happened, whereas genocide ever conducted by one of the worst regime, political regimes in human history, so there's kind of a balance there, but if you haven't like jfk, you know, the leader of the free world, you know, powerful, articulate, handsome, and so on. And he's brought down by who, Lee Harvey Oswald, some lone nut, this loser, you know, there's a. So you've got a pile on the, you know, the, the mafia and the CIA and he wold acted alone. Yeah, I do. Absolutely. Absolutely. No question. Why do you think that? Well, first of all, there's a ton of evidence that he did do it.

Speaker 2:          00:51:53       And most of the JFK conspiracy people also agree he was involved. He, that he was one of the shooters. It's one that they think there's more than one shooter, but so we have lots of evidence that he did it. You know, we have his rifle, we have the paper trail of what he bought the rifle. His fingerprints are on the rifle that was found in the fingerprints found several days after they found that they had it right away too. Is a lot of stuff with that. So when you go to appearance, he though that's really slippery. Well, okay, so here's one of the things that happens. The moment something takes on great significance. Our mind focuses on little anomalies. Like why was there that guy in Dealey Plaza with the umbrella? It's a sunny day. It's not going to rain set. Okay. So he was out there protesting, you know, decades later they've tracked this guy down.

Speaker 2:          00:52:40       He was called the umbrella man. It's like the cigarette smoking man on x files, like, Ooh, who is the umbrella man and that the umbrella must have been a gun and so forth. And he said, no, this is a leftover from world war chamberlain and in his umbrella. And he sold out to Hitler. And that, so the umbrella became a protest against government, whatever, and so he was protesting Kennedy with his umbrella. And uh, so that's. So that's a typical thing. Who Cares if somebody has an umbrella on a sunny day, whatever. It seems like a silly thing, but the moment something big happens. Okay. What is the meaning of that? I've never even heard of that umbrella guy, but I have researched. Did you ever read David Lifton's book of Yes to evidence? Yeah. That's pretty fascinating. Yeah. But, but Vincent Bugliosi, he dressed all of those claims is last.

Speaker 2:          00:53:23       One of his last books was a case closed now. That was Gerald Posner, also a good book whose book it was, like a restoring history or something like that. It's big massive thing. He did a shorter version and uh, but he lined up all those claims, you know, like one of them was that I had it as well get a job at the book depository building that was right on the parade route and he's going to turn right in front of it. There's Kennedy. He must have known he was planted there by operatives that knew this was going. No. So, uh, I think it was posner who track track down when the White House determined that Kennedy was even going to go to Dallas and then months later the parade route is determined. Just, you know, just before we went. And Oswald had that job there months before. It was just pure chance.

Speaker 2:          00:54:07       Randomness. So much of human history turns on random events. It's like the assassination of Franz Ferdinand had triggered the first world war. This was a conspiracy. There were seven operatives of the black hand, which was this Serbian nationalist organization and they wanted to assassinate the archduke Franz Ferdinand. Okay. So, and we know what the, you know, they went to this house to get the weapon and that has to get the grenade and the rifle and they, you, you stand on this corner, I'm going to be over there. And this is typically how it goes. A couple of them, chicken that somebody did, that, they went to the house, the person wasn't there to give them their weapon, cause there's like three of them left and then one of them through the hand grenade, it bounced off the car and went under another car and damage that car, but not the car.

Speaker 2:          00:54:51       And then to the whole thing was bungled and, and off he went and uh, and he gave a speech and then he decided to go back to the hospital to visit the people that were hurt and that and the trailing car. And they took the parade route back backwards on the course. And there's this guy, prince eps sitting there on the curb, despondent like, well that was a screw up and here comes the archduke ban. What was a little more complicated than that? In fact, the car stalled out because the cars back then were really bad at going in reverse. Right? So he was trying to put the car in reverse. The driver of the car is putting it in reverse. It was convertible, right? Yup. He's putting it in reverse. The car stalled out. And at that moment, a guy was coming out of a store or a restaurant where he had a sandwich because they had something to eat after it was over, literally walked out.

Speaker 2:          00:55:37       He was right there and shot him and shot his wife. So that's typically conspiracies that definitely can happen. And obviously if Oswald had that job, you know long in advance, it shows before they have planned that out. It showed that there's a lot of randomness involved at Lincoln assassination. That was a conspiracy. They were going to assassinate the vice president, president, vice president, secretary of state, secretary of war, and they had all the guys going to do this and they all screwed up in. The only one that succeeded was booth. But we knew that there was a conspiracy within hours. And then within days they got the whole thing. Where are the people that did this to Kennedy or nine slash 11. Who were the other operatives? Who is it? Who did it? Well, wasn't there a some deathbed confessions from. What was his name hunt. Was that the. That

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       guy that they have photos of him that he was arrested at the scene of the crime. You remember the Hobos that were arrested, that were behind the grassy knoll and there was so many people that called that said that they had heard shots from the grassy knoll. There's more than one that's possible because there was an echoing effect. If you go to Dealey Plaza, it's surprisingly small and our magic. It's weird when you see. Yeah, and you know there's a museum now on the sixth floor of the book. You can look right out the window and you can see the x on the street. First shot, second shot, Howard Hunt, Howard. Confessions of Howard Hunt know that he had said that on his deathbed he was a CIA spy, and on his deathbed he obviously can fit convicted Watergate conspirators. And he said that he was involved in the assassination.

Speaker 1:          00:57:08       He said that on his deathbed he talked about how he's an active participant. Yes. Okay. Well then, I don't know, I don't know this particular one, but why would you. Why would you like be so quick to think that more people weren't involved until I was open to the possibility. I mean, we did this issue of skeptic, you know, on the 50 years later, um, what, what clothes were closed? It was that bookcase closed. Uh, and then just one book. Well, and then Boleo sees book. I started reading, you know, just here's the claim, here's the explanation here. Hundreds of things. Did they cover hunt? I don't, I don't remember it probably. Did they, how do they cover the fact that the magic bullet theory was concocted because they had to account for a bullet that hit a curb under the overpass. You know that, right?

Speaker 1:          00:57:50       Yeah. But you know, Nova did a whole two hour special on the magic bullet and you know, the seats are not lined up. They're like this. It didn't have to make a right turn, left turn kind of thing. Yeah. That's. I mean, look, I've, I hunt and I shoot guns and bullets do weird things. When they hit things, they ricochet off stuff and they go left and they go, right? They go all over the place. It's you, the idea that you are going to act to accurately determine when someone shoots someone and hits bone where that bullet's going to go next is crazy. They do weird things, right. You know, they come out of people's heads. Sometimes you shoot someone in the front and it had come out the top of their head. It doesn't make any sense. Right? Um, but what doesn't make sense more than that is the pristine condition of that bullet after shattering bone.

Speaker 1:          00:58:34       Well, it wasn't a pristine. It was squished and compared to a bullet that's hit bone, there's like they've shot, I'm pretty sure it was another one that's shot through the jail. And then also your shot through Joe Shit shot bone. It was shattered. They've never been able to recreate the get a bullet to look like that after it shattered bone. Never. When the bullet hit connelly, it broke more than one bone in his body. Broke three different bones, I believe, and dislodged or broke his wrist. Like there's the bullet. Look at it. That's not bad. Yeah. When you look at it, it, it's, it's bulging. We have a picture of it here, by the way. There it is. Yeah, so it, it is compressed, but if you shoot a bullet in the water, it looks like that. Have you ever shot a bullet into water? Uh, no. I haven't done. They don't. They don't look when the bullet is coming out and it's, you know, there's

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       the, the, the gunpowder goes off and it's flying out. You're going to have some distortion and when a bullet shoots into a pillow or a shoots into anything, you're going to have some distortion because of that. Just sheer force and velocity of that bullet. But when you shatter bone, when they all get bent up and distorted, they don't get like that. That's not something that hit anything in my opinion. I think that if that. Not only that, the way they found it on the Gurney, on Connolly's Gurney when he was in the hospital. Oh look, we found the bullet. Here it is. It's ridiculous. That smacks of conspiracy, that billet bullet more than anything. I'm not saying that I know what happened, but I know that the reason why they came up with the fact that one bullet did the damage, not just in Kennedy but also in uncommonly was because they had an account for that bullet that hit the underpass and hit the underpass that ricocheted hit some guy and that guy went to the hospital.

Speaker 3:          01:00:14       They found the bullet hole in the granite of the, uh, the, the uh, curb stone. So they had to account for that. And that's why they came up with. It also was Arlen Specter was one of the guys who came up with that theory. It was a notorious scumbag. He was on the Watergate Commissioner, you know? Right. It's not a funkiness is what I'm saying and I'm not, but I have been in the past inclined to gravitate towards some pretty ridiculous conspiracies. But that bullet is anybody that knows anything about hunting or guns or any, any person that I know that I've talked to, like what do you, is this shot anything? Everyone say's no, everyone says that it hasn't hit.

Speaker 2:          01:00:49       But one thing to remember is that in all investigations are fields of inquiry. There's always an a residue of unexplained anomalies that any theory, physics, theory, evolution, whatever, you know, there's always. Yeah, but how do you explain this one little weird thing here that doesn't really get accounted for by your explanation over here. And the answer is, I don't know. No theory explains everything. But if you have an alternative theory, you have to explain all this stuff over here that the mainstream theory explains and the anomalies if you want to be taken seriously. And usually the focus on the anomalies is to the exclusion of all the other stuff that is nicely explained by the mainstream theory. So again, lone assassin explains a lot, not everything. So what do you do with the anomalies? Nothing. You don't have to do anything with them. I mean that is, it's okay to say, okay, that's weird. Let's keep investigating, but to, to then make the leap. But we know there was a second shooter. No, we just know there's anonymous.

Speaker 3:          01:01:47       We definitely don't know there was a second shooter. If there's no evidence whatsoever that we can say, look, here, we know for a fact there was a second shooter. We don't, there's nothing. Right? But we also don't know that one bullet did all that damage and the only reason why we believe that one bullet did all that damage is because that was what was presented and that they had this one boat. They said that they found in Connolly's Gurney that caused all this damage. That seems rather unlikely. Very, very unlikely. In fact,

Speaker 2:          01:02:14       the other thing we, uh, let's see, we had the, the number of people that heard shots,

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       four shots. Whenever you say the number of people like, God, man, I just don't buy eye witness testimony in a murder like that. It sounds so crazy. That's good. Well, that's right. Because it's not reliable. Well, not only that, there's so much chaos when you're there and the president gets shot. Bang, Bang. Right? Everybody's adrenaline's flying. They're running around. I heard 100 shots. You know, you're going to get outliers. You're going to get people that are caught. You're going to get some people that have served in the military and are used to like chaotic events that can recall it clearly and soberly. Didn't get a few of those, but good luck sifting through all that shit. Right? Eye witness evidence is. That's one of the things that drives me crazy. About nine slash 11 when people are really into the nine slash 11 story. They say people heard explosions in the buildings.

Speaker 3:          01:03:04       This guy said that he saw this and he saw they don't know what the fuck they saw. These giant buildings are falling down. Everybody's freaking out. Yup. I saw, I told the story once. I saw a squirrel in the woods once and I thought it was a wolf for like two seconds. I was in Canada and I said, well, it's fucking squirrel. What's wrong with me? You know, like I was worried about wolves, so I thought I saw for like, I mean I'm gonna look legit, solid. Two seconds I got this fucking squirrel was a wolf, so I don't buy the eyewitness stuff, but I also don't buy these people that are trying to like neatly like case closed. Not really. No, no. There's a lot of weird shit with that Kennedy assassination thing. There's also a lot of people that were mad at him because.

Speaker 3:          01:03:49       Absolutely. Look, he closed it as enemies. He had a lot. I mean, Kennedy was a very volatile human being more than Obama today. Oh yeah. I think so. Actually what Kennedy was trying to do as far as clothes, the Federal Reserve, he wanted to get rid of the CIA. He wanted to do a lot. He was opposed to secret service or secret societies. I mean that, that massive speech that he did about secret societies. He was a very fascinating guy and a lot of ways and you know, flawed in many as well and I'm sure if he was a president today who would be involved in probably he be like one of the most scandalous presidents of all time, but I'm not buying this. I mean, I, I definitely don't think that Lee Harvey Oswald was an innocent guy. It seems pretty obvious that he was involved in a lot of totally shit and remember he had tried to assassinate General Walker just in April before that and, and failed and we just don't think that he was by himself.

Speaker 3:          01:04:44       I just don't. I don't think it just really don't think that he was the only one involved in that. It just seems the way a lone assassin could operate that that is the likeliest scenario. In a free society, you can disappear into the nooks and crannies, a big cities and no one will ever notice you. It's like the nine slash 11 up pilots that we're training to take off but not ever learned to land. Why didn't we notice that? Well, you know, we weren't looking for that. Too many things going on. It doesn't mean after the fact. It's so easy to be an armchair quarterback and go, you know, I'll tell you what they would have known

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       should have known well after Pearl Harbor, they were conspiracy theories at Roosevelt. Either new, either orchestrated or knew it would happen, let it happen to squelch the American firsters movement which was imported by um, Lindbergh and, and, and he had promised Churchill support, but he can only do so much the destroyers and all that we need to have. And then something happens. Okay, so it looks like, oh, he must have been involved because he is then able to act and get America into the Second World War. But usually politicians act in response to something. Now's my opportunity to take advantage of this thing that happened to get my way. But all politicians do that. It doesn't mean they're conspiring to make the thing happen to get their way. I don't think the argument was that he was conspiring. The argument was that he knew and then pulled out some of the more major warships.

Speaker 2:          01:06:07       So. So here's the other attack it. It's like the, the August ninth, 2001 memo from Condoleezza Rice, Osama bin Ladin to attack us soil. Okay. What about that? Clearly Bush, it must have known and you know, okay, well what we're forgetting is that the tens of thousands of pieces of Intel that come in every day, this could happen as good after the fact. You go back and go, oh look, there's the one we should have known. Same thing with Pearl Harbor. You know Japanese might attack in Hawaii. Yeah, but they might attack in the Philippines. They might attack Alaska, they may attack, you know, and so on and so on, which is the right one that we're supposed to then focus our resources on. You don't know until it happens and then you go back and go, you're fired because you should have acted on that memo. Well, but that's why I think you would have to be an expert in code as well.

Speaker 2:          01:06:54       You'd have to be an expert and to be able to understand what they had, what they had intercepted, would codes it intercepted and what information they actually had back then. It's again, one of those things that after the fact it's very easy to draw conclusion saying this had to be a conspiracy. I mean, I think even the history channel had something where they were saying that they knew that the attack was going to happen, they let it happen so that they could get into world war two. Right? That's, well, that was a conspiracy theory at the time and there was a congressional investigation. So the equivalent of the Warren report about that and concluded no, that there was no conspiracy on the part of the US government or any administration to, you know, that should be held responsible. I mean, a few people I think were fired for not having the planes in the right place or something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:07:38       But uh, yeah. But again, that's just. And then the other thing we had that other psychological effect is that we tend to, when you're on the outside, you tend to see big organizations is more powerful than they really are. Big Corporations, CEO's, big government agencies, and the administrators that run them from the outside, it looks like. I know they have a lot of power and they can do a lot of things, but when you're. When you get the job, then you find out, oh, there's a lot of things I can't do, and here's another one of these conspiracy theories. That might be true. When you get elected president, they take you in the back room and they go, okay, here's, here's what's actually going on and get my. Here's what's actually going on in Iraq. No one knows, but you can't pull the troops. You can't close the

Speaker 1:          01:08:15       base. You can't. Oh, well, I said I was going to do that yet. Don't worry about it. They all say that, that you can't do it. Oh, all right. You know, I think there's a lot of act that goes on that you don't find out that we just don't know and we could maybe later. It's all speculation, but I think when you're dealing with something like these massive global events, after they occur, every people are always trying to do some sort of investigative reporting or trying to figure it out. They're trying to go back over the pieces and connect things that make sense and the problem is you get confirmation bias on both sides. You get confirmation bias where people are trying to show very clearly that there was no conspiracy whatsoever and then you get people to try and see conspiracy and everything and I think with a lot of these stories, a lot of these major events like whether it's jfk assassination or many other ones, there's a lot of weirdness to them that make it real hard to wrap up nice and tight and when people can't wrap them up nice and tight, they get very uneasy.

Speaker 1:          01:09:09       Yeah, and it's. It's okay to just say, I don't know. It could be a conspiracy. Maybe not. Let's just. Yes, keep an open mind. I mean, you don't have to conspire. You don't have to construct a whole nother world view of operatives and agents plots. You could just say that's a weird thing. Exactly, and I think it's also very important that we recognize that there have been conspiracies before like nine slash 11 by itself as a consensus 19 members of okay, I had a bloody and fly planes into buildings. That's a conveyance inspired. Yeah. And that's one. That's one group that we don't know. We also know about, like we said, the operation northwoods and there's been some false flag events that happened in the Gulf of Tonkin. That's another one. There's, yeah, there's been some lies and we know that so it makes the whole thing like really weird.

Speaker 1:          01:09:52       But this is me and these were, we're talking about actual real events as opposed to like psychics and Tarot card readers or you know, my wife's friend went to a fucking psychic the other day and I had to listen to this nonsense. They were talking to me about the psychic thing, you know, you know, we went and she knew everything and she was so amazing and she was asking me about my aunt and how could she have known like, Oh, fucking Christ first. I wish I was there, I wish I was there to see what kind of questions she asked and how you answered. Yeah. Because usually they tell the psychics that fed back later while they have these leading questions and then you give them partial answers and then they fish for more and then before you know it there, you know, you're all, you're filling in the blanks together and they want to believe, you know, and a lot of times there's like some weird social aspect to it, like a hand holding or something like that where it's like this intimacy thing where you don't, you don't want to be confrontational with this person.

Speaker 1:          01:10:50       And so you sort of kind of helped them. Yep. Your bolt in each other's space because you're only like two feet away from each other. It's odd. There's a lot of oddness and a lot of real psychodrama. Yeah. I had a friend who worked the psychic friends network line back in the nineties when Dionne Warwick on that company. And uh, he's, he was a magician that, you know, couldn't quite make a decent living doing magic stuff. So he did

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       this on the side and it became fairly lucrative, so he told me, you know, he operated from home and you just have another phone line and they send you the calls and you get, I think he got sixty cents on the minute and the company got, you know, it was three 95 a minute. He got sixty cents on the minute, but they rewarded you the longer you keep them on the subjects on the line, the more higher percentage you get of each minute. And uh, so he would do this by working through different categories and mostly people call it night and weekends they're lonely and need somebody to talk to, you know, love, health, money, career, especially love relationships, jobs, your boss, you know, people would just Yak, Yak, Yak, Yak. And then he got pretty good sort of like. The analogy I make is like with Dr Laura's Colin Talk Show, you know, sees has a rich database of problems that people have, why they call her and you know, every.

Speaker 2:          01:12:02       So every call she knows within 10 seconds, oh, it's problem number seven. It's number 16 year. They get the one with the guy and he just hone right in on it. So these psychics, they have a deep database of human psychology connected Dr Laura to it. Well, she was just listen to that show. Find similarities. Absolutely. No, not that she's running a psychic scam. Not at all, but that, but that the psycho, there's only so many variations on of human psychology and human nature. What do people care the most about relationships, you know, love health. Many career. So you just work your way through those four. And then people just open up and pour stuff out, take a few notes and then like 45 minutes later. Well, let's talk about your, you know, your uncle Bob. Bob, how could he have known about uncle? Well, you told them half an hour ago so people forget that.

Speaker 2:          01:12:51       So if you record them, you video tape and more tape recorder. It's very enlightening. Um, uh, I did a show with John Stossel when he was with ABC 20 slash 20 on, on, uh, John and James and Prague and they got a, they didn't tell Vanpraagh guy was involved, but they taped them all day, uh, bringing people in to do readings and cameras and set up and stuff like this. And when you sit there with a counter, like how many times has he asked this question or say these things and it's just hundreds. And so his hit rate was maybe less than 10 percent, but they only remembered that, that, you know, the handful of the 10 percent and forgot the hundreds of names he would throw out and comments he would make. And so there's a confirmation bias. There's a, you know, a high data, high data rate, you just pouring stuff out and then people pick out the ones that they remember and then we'd catch him cheating once in a while like, you know, well, let's take a break.

Speaker 2:          01:13:44       Everybody break. Then you leave the camera rolling and then he starts chatting with people you know. So who are you here for? Oh my aunt, she passed over. Okay. Yeah. And then like half an hour later I'd like to come to this woman here. Now don't tell me who you're here for, but I'm getting. I see a woman on your, over your left shoulder. I don't want to say sister mother. Is it an aunt? Oh my God. Yeah. And it looks, you know, it's uh, it's edited and the way it looks, you know, like they, they're really getting something.

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       But when you, when you really see it in operation, you can see the whole thing unfolds completely as a psychodrama. Well, we had this guy on the show, his name is, he's abandoned. I know he's great and it's fantastic because he's a magician and he does those psychic reading things, but he'll tell you right away, this is a trick. I am really good at it. I am not a psychic. I have no psychic ability whatsoever, but I can't tell you how I'm doing this, but I know how to do this. Right. And he was bending spoons and doing all this craziness and you know, did card tricks, all kinds of crazy stuff where you go, this is insane, how is this possible? But he was really adamant about letting you know, like these people that are psychics that are telling you about your future, your past, they're all con people.

Speaker 1:          01:15:00       They're all, they're doing terrible things. They're trying to pretend that you're dead relatives are communicating with you from the great beyond. They're giving you this sense of hope, but they're all scammers. And you know, having a guy like that who's very skilled at that style of what we. I think he calls it, he's a mentalist. A mentalist. Yeah. It's, it's amazing to watch though. It is. God is so good at it. Bannon checks one of the best. Yeah. But he's also one of the, sort of one of the leaders of a skeptical movement. Yes. Which is ethical magic. Yes. He's an entertainer and it's not doing anything horrible. You know, he's not ripping anybody off and he's really adamant about it. So I, I love him. Yeah. I love what he was on a cruise with him on set one of these cruise ship things with other skeptics and uh, so he did some of these mentalism stuff and he, he told me how he did one of them and he's, he's pretty good about not telling the truth, but I really pressed him on this particular thing when he would touch somebody like on the shoulder here and then you're blindfolded and then, and then you would say, I felt like you touched me on the same, you know, the left shoulder, that right.

Speaker 1:          01:16:02       And you had a whole sequence of these things where the other person was picking up on the queue of where he was being touched. So anyway, I was just stunned by this, like, how is he doing this? I know he's not really psychic, you know? And then he told me how he did it. I'm like, Oh, oh, that is so good and it's so simple, but you can't tell us. Uh, but, and, and that's really probably the best reason why you don't want to know how the magicians do it because it's almost always super simple. And like, Oh, I should've seen that penn and teller was penn. Jillette teller really doesn't talk that much, but there was an old show that was on television in Australia or radio, I think it was on radio or television, I don't remember. But there was this trick that they did. Um, and it was the way the pen like, god damn it, I'm trying to, I'm struggling to remember how exactly it worked, but it was this woman who could, uh, she, she could tell the future or she could, she could some sort of psychic ability. And penn explained it and the way he explained it, he didn't want to explain

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       it like they did it on the rate is for radiolab, radiolab podcast. And they explained it on there. I'm doing a terrible Job explaining this, but when you hear the explanation, I won't give it out because I don't want to ruin it for anybody who hasn't heard it before. But when you hear the explanation, you go, oh god, yeah, that's it. Of course fuckers fuckers. But, but having that, the ability to sneaky trick people like that. But you can make a lot of money if you're an unethical person and you can fool a lot of people and you know, but like one of the examples I use, you know penn and teller do the cups and balls, but they use clear plastic cups so you can see where the ball is and how it's being done. But you still, you still get fooled. Yes. Because the power of the, you know, the sort of following his gaze or following the movement of the hand and this and that.

Speaker 2:          01:17:58       It's done so well that you still miss it with a clear plastic with it. So this is a good example where even knowing the trick, you might still be fooled. What is it about people that want to fund the. Is it, is it something about the search for human knowledge? Like the thing that's always inside of people where they're trying to find out where's the food, where's the enemy coming from? What's going to happen in the future as it seems to be like some search for human knowledge that is a part of people's desire to uncover mystery. You know, there's almost like a genetic calling find. well, what it is is just, it's just learning and survival. So I call this patternicity the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise. And my thought experiment is imagine you're a hominid on the plains of africa three and a half million years ago, small brain australopithecine, your name is lucy, and that you hear a rustle in the grass.

Speaker 2:          01:18:53       Is that a dangerous predator or is it just the wind? So if you assume that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it's just the wind, that's a type one error, a false positive, you thought a was connected to be but but no harm you, you just become skiddish and cautious or whatever. But if you assume that the rustle in the grass is just the wind and it turns out it's a dangerous predator, your lunch just been given a darwin award for taking yourself out of the gene pool early before reproducing. So in other words, it's better to just assume that all things you think Are connected, all rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not the wind, just in case, and there's not. There's not a big cost to pay for making a type one error, a false positive.

Speaker 2:          01:19:32       There is a higher cost for making a type two error or false negative. So we assume that this is the basis of superstition and magical thinking. We just assume that this is connected to that you pull the slot and you do this, you pull the slot machIne, you win or whatever, and this is what skinner show back in the fifties where you just randomly give reinforcements to rats and pigeons and whatever they were doing just before they got rewarded. They'll just repeat that behavior. Even if it's like twirling counterclockwise twice and that's the basis of superstition it. There's nothing wrong with their brains. They're just trying to find causal connections between events, the environment, and that's the basis of survival. So all of us are subject to making those connections. Some are more gullible than others. Say are more skeptical, but for the most part all of us can easIly be fooled if it's done right.

Speaker 2:          01:20:22       That's. that's the beauty of good cons, good scams is that anybody could fall for them, even smart people, and if anything, smart people are more likely to believe weird things in this sense that once they believe it, they think they've drawn a connection. They're Better at rationalizing the reasons why they believe than say, less educated or less intelligent people. And so as people like panacek will tell you, there's nothing better than an audience of scientists at mit. Oh boy, I can really fool them because they think they're so smart. I can't be full to wow, okay. He must be doing something really, really super psychic because you know, I'm super smart, but. Well no, because all of our sensory apparatus works the same and magicians know how to manipulate your gaze, your attention, whatever, and had a fool you.

Speaker 3:          01:21:08       this is so weird how people are drawn to trying to uncover mystery so you know, whether it's ghosts or whether it's a like how many goddamn go shows do they have to have where no one ever sees it knows they stop having go shows. I know those things drive me crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:21:24       We don't do very many issUes like on astrology. Is it real? It's like we took care of this, you know, decades ago. There's nothing new.

Speaker 3:          01:21:33       Okay. Astrology as far as like, you know, hey, you're a leo, so you're inclined to be a leader. Like that kind of bullshit. But is there anything to those really complex astrological readings? Were they, they look for the time of day you were born and mercury's and retro.

Speaker 2:          01:21:51       Yeah. Have you looked into that? I know nothing about it. Nothing to it. Nothing at all. Nope. Absolutely nothing. It's all in the psychology of the reading. So if you mix up somebody's reading for, you know, you're a leo, but you know, we gave you the virgo reading or whatever for that day. Almost everybody go, yeah, boy, that's all total hustle.

Speaker 3:          01:22:10       Yeah, all of that. What about nancy reagan? She believed, I don't understand what you're saying.

Speaker 2:          01:22:16       Yes. God rest her soul. God rest her soul didn't use a psychic. She consulted a little bit. I mean, they got played up quite a bit, uh, for ronnie's travel schedule a little bit. Uh, I don't think we can say that state decisions were made based on astrological readings

Speaker 3:          01:22:32       and it could've also been like, you know, you always know someone who has a wacky husband or a wacky wife, that believability shit. And then the person sort of like, oh dear, what did you say? Okay, I'll listen.

Speaker 2:          01:22:43       You know, how I don't think president reaGan was paying much attention to it.

Speaker 3:          01:22:48       He wasn't paying much attention to anything towards the end, you know, but, uh, but this desire to uncover hidden mysteries is always been really confusing to me because, uh, myself personally, I've felt the pole like, especIally like aliens and ufo, like I went

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       deep, deep, deep into like, uh, when I was real young. Um, I um, cut into the roswell thing and uh, there's a lot of different connections with the roswell conspiracy about this crashed ufo in New Mexico in 1947 and all the eye witness reports and boy, you go down the rabbit hole of that thing and you could waste years of your life. You know, there was a study done In a, it was a ufo report. Then in the late fifties, I think it was 59 on the 500 most important ufo cases of the last 20 years. Roswell wasn't even on the list, but how is it not on the list? Roswell didn't become roswell until 1980 when there was a made for tv movie. And then charles berlitz that language, a book publisher, he got into, they got me those fucks, those books going after van donican, chariots of the gods, that bestseller.

Speaker 2:          01:24:01       Then book started pouring out about aliens and ufo. And then there was the movie, remember when the chariots of the gods of the film was released in the theaters. I remember leonard nimoy and search. Oh yeah, man, a conjecture and was, was a great job. I loved that, I used to watch that show, but that's, that got me in a big foot. But that's an example of, of um, you know, how the popular media drives a lot of these things. What do we really know back then? Nothing. I mean, it was just a couple of little anomalous things. And here's an example, you know, conspiracy. Okay. So the government lied when they said it was a weather balloon. Yes. They did your surprise that governments lie really? Because of course it was an national, it was a, it was a high altitude surveillance balloon listening for the acoustic signatures of a nuclear explosion in the upper atmosphere, but it's soviet.

Speaker 2:          01:24:48       So of course when this debris came down and you know, the farmer's field there outside of albuquerque have a roswell, New Mexico, of course they're not going to come out and hold a press conference. You go, well, let's see. Actually what we are doing is launching this project to listen to soviet. It was suspicious too when something becomes not just a story, but it also becomes business. And roswell became a giant business so much, much later. Uh, you know, again, there were a bunch of sightings in the forties and fifties and, but, but that's around the time that there was a lot of experimental aircraft, horse and so whenever, but anybody says, well, I saw this triangular shaped black thing. Are you near an air force base? Have you looked at pictures of the b two bomber, the stealth bomber? It's sort of a delta shaped wing shaped. And when it flies right over the rose parade every January 1st comes right over my house and altadena circles right when it comes at you, it's silent and it's this weird black because they painted that black paint that doesn't reflect and if you didn't know about it and you're out in the desert and it's dusk and yeah, it's like a big kind of spooky. Like what I saw one when I was a film and fear factor in 2002. So it was right after september 11, not far, not long afterwards. And we were filming out there

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       in a way out in the desert area. Palm dale, I guess it wasn't. Yeah. And it's real close to the air force base and we saw a stealth bomber flying over and it looks like an alien space. Yeah, it's amazing when you see one, you're like, whoa. Like if you didn't know and you had never heard one of those before and you looked up in the sky, you'd be sure that that came from another planet. I mean, it looks like it's right out of star wars in the eighties and nineties there were ufo sightings in America. And the ufo is looked strangely like blimps. That's weird. Yeah. So that, that's the kind of thing people see weird things. And again, the propensity is not to just say, I saw an anomaly. Wow. I don't know. That's weird. And leave it at that. Our mind immediately goes back to your idea.

Speaker 1:          01:26:49       We love the mystery. Let's concoct this whole thing. The martians are coming and it's the aliens and there's a whole nother worldview. Um, and uh, you know, it's like this, um, there's this anomalous star kic with a bunch of numbers that dims about 20 percent every period of time, whatever that is. It's about 1400 light years away. So, uh, and the astronomers study in this decide, okay, it's not planets, it's not comments coming around in front of us that dims the light. Um, so, so immediately people go to. It's a dyson sphere. It's a gigantic solar collecting array that circles around the planet that collects energy from the sun. Oh, this is a recent story. Reasons. So, but you know what? I did some radio shows, uh, locally about this. And immediately the host go to will. Well, whAt do they like? What, what does, who like the aliens?

Speaker 1:          01:27:40       Like, no, no, no. All of this we have is just an anomaly in the light, you know, signature of this start. That's all we have. We don't have. The Problem also with social media is it becomes click bait. It becomes someone writes a blog or someone has a thing and there's a video that's linked to it and then everybody starts sending that out to their friends. And before you know it, that becomes the narrative, right? Yep, that's right. Found some sort of a gigantic satellite that's orbiting. Whether it's like a death star that's reading this planet, it dims it because it comes into, you know, between us and that, yeah, that kind of stuff is very confusing to a lot of people because you don't have enough time to really research it right now. That's why something like what you do, like skeptic magazine or the entire skeptic community is a great resource and snopes, snopes.com.

Speaker 1:          01:28:24       Snopes is fantastic where it breaks down and goes, okay, here's what we absolutely know for a fact. So look at that. It's okay to just say, I don't know. Yeah, but I just always hard to remember that. I've always been so confused as to what it is about what I mean. I've known grown adults that have spent years and years with real life, like fascinated with big foot, you know, fascinated with ufo is fascinated with these mysteries and you, when you look at the amount of resources that they, they actually expand chasing after these things and say, well if you that into like something

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       positive, something constructed a, my god, you know, you, you would, you would do so well. Like I often see that thing about like certain scammers and I'm like, my god, if these people just started a business with the same amount of enthusiasm, right, how good would they be doing? Right? I mean, those guys running the, the, uh, internet scams and stuff, what if they just did a legitimate company, they'd probably make more money. What is it about mysteries? That's one of the real important things that I wanted to talk to you about. I think one of the appeals of the ufo aliens thing is it's kind of a secular religion because they're often portrayed as god like figures and if you don't believe in the traditional god, then that is kind of, they're out there. They're very powerful. They know about us. They're coming to rescue us, save us.

Speaker 2:          01:29:46       So much of science fiction is, you know, has these kinds of themes to it. Uh, like the day the earth stood still, that classic 1951 film, michael, randy as klaatu and the ship comes to Washington dc. It's a christ allegory that he's come to talk to the authorities, you know, humans are sending. We have to stop this, this case, it was nuclear war and the remake with keanu reeves. It was global warming and the authorities want to see him. So he mingles among the common people like jesus did. And then he takes up with the Patricia Neal character who's the single mom in the town and uh, and, and then he's killed by the authorities and he's putting the more you put in this morgue, which is sort of like the tomb. And then in that famous scene where Patricia Neal goes to the robot, he's standing there and the pfizer comes up and he's going to zapper and she gives him the famous message, you know, gore cloud to burrata, nick, which basically says, go get clapped.

Speaker 2:          01:30:43       At least he's in the, he's in the tomb. So he, he marches over to the tomb and burns a hole in it, takes the body, returns it to the ship and resurrection right there. Jesus. It's like, it's his name in the, in the movie was Mr. Carpenter, earthly name mr carmen are interested in. And in the original script, um, uh, we're in the film. She says, wow, that's incredible. You mean this is the power of science and technology in the future, and the original script, he says, yeah, this is where it's gone, but the brain censorship board, 1951 said you can't say that, that you know, americans will be offended by this. So they changed the line and now he says something like, no, no, no one has the power over life and death. Only the great spirit can determine, you know, was just some bologna line and, but, but, but so much of, of the way we talk about aliens is that they are, like, I call them deities are atheists, they're like gods and the chariots of the gods.

Speaker 2:          01:31:38       I mean that's kind of that thesis, but it's not so far fetched in the sense that if not that they've come here, they probably haven't come here, but if they're out there and they probably are, there's good reasons to think there's extraterrestrials and if we encountered them, they're not going to be behind us technologically because we wouldn't encounter them otherwise. So if we do find a signal or whatever it's going to be from an advance how far advanced, so the chances of them being in parallel with us on an evolutionary timescale, virtually zero, you know they're going to be, and if they're out of sync by just a little bit from when they started on their planet evolving, it would be millions of years in advance. And look what we've been able to accomplish just in say a hundred years of of technology, 50 years of computer technical. Why would it have to be millions of years in advanced?

Speaker 2:          01:32:24       Couldn't it just be 100 or 100 years in advance of us? If we're thinking about colonizing mars the next few decades, right? You get some sort of an advanced civilization that has less conflict in us because of how long it takes to get from bacterial grade life to an intelligent communicating like probably three and a half billion years is how long it took here. So wherever, whenever your plant it starts, the chances of it going to be in perfect synchrony of every step along the way from bacterial grade life to big brains. If anything, it's probably going to be millions of years of difference in timescale, just just on the biology. So just randomly meet even to get to where we are. It could be a million plus or minus just to reach this level correct where we've reached just whatever billion years it was. Didn't have to be. That number.

Speaker 2:          01:33:13       Could have been much longer, could have been shorter or just started later. We started earlier. We'll also, we have to deal with the impact that killed the dinosaurs. That could be all the random events that happened. It could be, they could be on a planet that doesn't have any random events like that or it'd be way ahead of, or they could be on one that has a lot of them. So the answer to the fermi paradox that whereas everybody, because they should have happened already, is probably, uh, the universe timi with bacterial grade life. But the number of steps to get from there all the way to communicating technological society is enormous. And so that winnows down the number of possibilities you can get all the way to, to neanderthals like here on earth, you know, they're big brain, 1500 ccs, but the size of our brain maybe a little bit larger.

Speaker 2:          01:33:59       And uh, you know, they had fire, they had tools. I'm at tesco, everything but disco, uh, and they had europe to themselves are about 300,000 years and there's no advancement in their toolkits. They're all pretty much the same. They never had cave paintings. They didn't look like they had symbolic art like a homo sapiens did. I believe their brains were larger though to deal with their larger bodies. Well, even when you correct for body size, theiR brains are slightly larger, but only slightly. It may be the brain size may not make any difference. Maybe brain modularity, maybe they didn't have language, or if they did, maybe they didn't have communicate symbolic language. We don't know why they went extinct. but when humans, homo sapiens arrived in europe, within a few tens of thousands of years, there was no more a neanderthals gun. They went extinct and there's a big debate paleoanthropology circles.

Speaker 2:          01:34:53       Why so? But, but my point is thAt you could have a three and a half billion years of evolution on a planet and get all the way to neanderthals who have stone tools and it just stops. For whatever reason, they never developed symbolic communication. They have opposable thumbs so they can make stuff, they can make tools, but they never make the next step. Right now, some people disagree with that. They, they, they think that had a homo sapiens, not dominated europe when they came in. Neanderthals might have gotten there within a few centuries more maybe, but we, you know, we don't know that well. There's also the thought that even though the unIverse is infinite, right, that it had some sort of a beginning, whether you buy or don't buy, that there's actually been some arguments. Wasn't there some arguments recently that the, perhaps the universe didn't have a beginning or an end, but that it's been an eternal.

Speaker 2:          01:35:40       That's always been, it could be eternally cycling there, there could be multiple big bang. So there was never. Yeah. So the idea could possibly be that if that is the case. Right? So if you have an event and from that event things become more and more complex. Start getting single cell life, multicellular life like we have here on earth. There has to be a first like us first. It has to. Somebody has to be first. Maybe first. Yes, that's what I'm saying. Like if I exist multigenerational our stars. And so there's been many, many generations of stars older than ours. So this is the pheromone. Where is everybody. I mean there should have been somebody made it for. But when you think about how complex life is on earth and how many different varieties of it, and there's only one human, there's only one technologically communicating species and where it so, so is it possible?

Speaker 2:          01:36:29       Yeah, that's right. You got to have a planet teaming with life with dolphins and chimpanzees, big brains. And they lots of puppies and they never, they never built it, you know, they no laptops, nothing. Yeah. So it is possible that we, since we exist, it is possible the, we're the only ones that exist. Uh, it's possible. It's totally possible. It's totally possible. We just don't know. but that's terrifying. The seti argument that search for extraterrestrial intelligence scientists, these aren't the ufo people. There are their counter argument to that is there, but there are so many planets now that we know about, virtually every star in the galaxy of 100 billion stars has planet. So we're talking hundreds and hundreds of billions of planets. The chances that it never happened anywhere, you know? Okay. It's a small, it's pretty small. So they probably out there somewhere, but it's a vast empty, you know, cosmos, you know that there's a lot that we know that doesn't have intelligent life, that a lot of plants, right? We have one planet that we know of, that as intelligent life at all the plants we've ever discovered. And obviously there's some that we've discovered that are so far out there, we only get glimpses of what their atmosphere contains. Well, the next generation, they'll, they'll, they'll be able to get the atmospheres, the, uh, the webb space telescope will, I'm told they just getting it from a light spectrum. now in the, in the spectrum, you could see if there's oxygen, for example, in methane, so they must have cows that are forwarding methane. Methane,

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       the british say to sound intelligent, I try to use british. You spelled tires with a y t, y r e s c u under the hitchens and dawkins, he's got that british accent. It sounds so much better. Super things and late night tv. Absolutely. Yeah. Yup. It works. So yeah. Anyway, the mystery. You talked about us about the mystery. Well, you know, there's not quite sure why our brains go toward that. I mean, I'm sure my dog has a good life, but I don't think he contemplates the cosmos. Does dogs a loser, especially when it's time for food. When I was trying to get at though is that there's, there's a thing that we do where it's not just. I mean, there's, there's the longing for extra terrestrial life, you know, the search for the technological daddy, you know, the, the, uh, advanced alien daddy that's out there that's going to show us the error of our ways.

Speaker 1:          01:38:51       There's, there's that pole. but then there's also this weird poll where we want to believe that these intelligent beings from another planet can recognize who our elected leaders are and be In cahoots with them as if they give a shit about obama or anything. I mean, if you like descended upon an ant colony, would you have a deal with the queen? Like, look, I know you're the one who in charge of this. So I'll talk to you this election. You don't want to be super secretive and since you are so moral and ethical, you know, and you don't lie to your people at all. I'm only gonna communicate with you. And in exchange for technological secrets, I would like some dna like is so preposterous, stupid idea that they would come down and they would talk to the military leaders, especially military leaders from the 1940 [inaudible] who knew almost nothing about technology or this idea that they, you know, at roswell know we capture when their spacecraft and back engineered their technology and that's where it's silicon chips and computers came from.

Speaker 1:          01:39:52       Do you know about the american computer company? Did you ever hear about these people? There was a company called the american computer company and this was back during the, um, art bell days of a coast to coast with heartfelt wish. I loved coming home many that I've been on it once to, was the one of the highlights of my life. I was recently when he came back on the radio or internet. So I was driving home from the comedy store one night and they had this, uh, they were talking about this american computer company and this guy that rents american computer company, that was, he's out of his fucking mind. And he apparently he had this theory and this whole website dedicated, I don't know if it's up anymore, they might have taken it down with, is dedicated to showing the timeline of the creation of the transistor and all this came out of bell labs, which is where they had the air force base outside of bell labs to protect it from alien invasion. Oh my god. And that this is where all of our technology came from. The we're supposed to Believe that the aliens were

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       only about five to 10 years more advanced than us from vacuum tubes to the silicon transistors. I mean, really that's it. That's the fiber optics. They managed to traverse the best instance of interstellar space with technology. Just barely better than vacuum tubes with agera. Pay attention to that. Robert lasar guy. he's. Yes. Bizarre ones. He's a bizarre. It sounds so good. I think there are some people that just make stuff up. He's so good at it though, but he's also smart, which is fucking really scary because this guy came up with a hydrogen powered engine for his corvette. You know, which people have done, you know, they're doing it now, like people are developing hydrogen power plants for cars, but he had this like decades ago. So he's obviously a very smart and smart, doesn't, uh, doesn't protect you from believing and weird things. Isn't that bizarre?

Speaker 2:          01:41:45       They are not just believing in weird things, but bullshitting ps, right? Yeah. Yeah. Well then somebody who's smart, educated is going to be better at, at bullshitting people. Well, he was. He bullshitted people about is education too though. That was part of the problem. I think some people went back and looked through his education, said, well, there's no evidence that you ever went to the school. And so that, that through some monkey wrenches into. He was one of the area. Fifty one guys were saying worked at area 51. Yep. Well, area 51 is a top secret. A military base or they. So you know, you and I aren't gonna be able to drive there. Go wherever we're doing a show. We want to blow the lid off these crazy. You know, you're still not coming in here. Oh, okay. So what are you hiding? Well, you know, of course there, you know, it'd be interesting to know now that we know about the b two stealth bomber, what are they doing now that we won't find out for 20 more years that people are seeing out in the desert in the middle of the night?

Speaker 2:          01:42:33       I saw this spooky. Weird. Definitely. And that's how it works. We find out eventually in the meantime, just say, I don't know, it's a weird thing. Well, the uh, the, the, the oddest part about it is this belief that they're in, in conspiracy with our elected leaders, that, that one to me has been so strange that they will land somewhere and they have these meetings and these elected leaders make deals with the ufo. How amazing would that be though, if that was true courage? They're reptilians are running the country from New Mexico. people love this idea of blowing the lid off of it. You know, that's something that people love. They love investigating. They love the investigative journalism aspect of blowing the lid off this global conspiracy. Well, I think that's what drives some of the kind of anti medical establishment, anti big pharma anti-vaccination, you know, those guys, they're behind closed or the big powerful people, cOrporations and government agents, the cdc and this company and the ceo and the politic, you know, they're all and they want to make money and you know, and, and they, they first, they think they're more powerful than they really are.

Speaker 2:          01:43:44       And second, that's not how the world works. I mean, these people are not tryinG to keep us poisoned or keep us sick so they can make money. You

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       know, it's the real conspiracies are, you know, how can we can't get our drugs cheaper? Uh, you know, those are the, you know, what sort of behind the door deals are being done. Uh, you know, that prevent healthcare from being cheaper. That's where the real, the real conspiracy. I had a conversation with someone who's trying to tell me they already have a cure for cancer or they just don't want you to have the cure because then they'll know the money's in the treatment. I gO, why do you think the same person has the cure as the the same people that are selling the treatment really think they're the same person. Right? Do you have any people work in the field of creating new medicine? I mean, that's so ridiculous that it would be the one person of the tens of thousands of employees at amgen or wherever is going to, you know, leave and go, oh, I found something out and I'm coming on your show to tell you I took pictures.

Speaker 1:          01:44:37       Here's was not one. Well, it just doesn't make any sense that it would be the same person. The odds of it being the same person or the same company, the, there's so many different people that work in the pharmaceutical industry. So many different people that are trying to do research on new medications and there's so much money involved in it that there's one company would come up with a cure and they would like to keep it under wraps because they are in cahoots with the other company that's got the treatment. Right. And so, I mean, if this were true then then all the people that were sick from polio and all the Businesses and companies that were making money from polio patients, how come they didn't stop the polio vaccine? Right? Or you know, just pick any, any, you know, any particular industry like that where we have made real progress.

Speaker 1:          01:45:19       but then there are some things where you go, okay, there's definitely too many people that are getting prescribed pain pills. Like what? What is going on? And what is the conspiracy that I've, I've had conversations with people that went to doctors now they have something wrong with them and the doctor wants to prescribe them. I had a fucking nose operation. I had a deviated septum repaired and my doctor gave me not one, but two different opiates to take. I didn't take anything. My, I wasn't in pain. Okay. And he was like, you're going to be in pain. I'm like, I'm telling you man, I barely. It's barely uncomfortable. Well, so again, we know how some of this works. You know, the, the drug companies take the doctors out on their golfing trips. They give them free samples and this and that. Well, my wife's mom was a nurse and they used to take them out to dinner.

Speaker 1:          01:46:03       These pharmaceutical reps would talk to them and they want. It wasn't like they said, hey, we want you to tell these people to take our drugs. It's, they became friendly and they did nice things to them and it was almost understood that in exchange you would talk well about their drug or the principle of reciprocity for you. Now you owe me. You don't even have to say it. They wanted those trips. They want. You don't have to say it. That's where it's interesting. You don't have to say it right. And so they're making money and that's, that's reality. I mean the, the, the sheer volume of pain pills that they've sold in this country since the 19 eighties. It's stunning. But also I saw this when my, um, my step dad was ill for, oh, probably 10 years of just going through in his eighties, just melting down one thing after

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       another. And I was the one taking them around all the different docs and you know, I could sort of see how it works. He's like, you know, the dogs go look a dick. I don't know. I don't know what the problem is. Well, can you give me something? I'm in pain right? Well doc, come on, I just drove down here. All right here, take this. You know. So they kind of feel like, well I got to do something. I don't know what it is. I don't know what to do, but okay, he's asking me, all right, I'll give him some painkillers. I'll give him this or that makes it feel better. And my dad would take it like, yeah, this is great. There's certainly that. There's also certainly incompetent doctors. There's doctors that are really willing to prescribe ssri antidepressants like with alarming, right? Consistency.

Speaker 2:          01:47:31       So there you have the medicalization of what are really probably just social behavioral issues. So you know, when we were kids in school and a little johnny was super active and had high energy, whatever. Okay. And now he's a great athlete or he's doing this or that. And now he's like, well, what's wrong with him? Oh, well he has this medical pro. Oh, he's a d, h, d. Oh, oh, that's a thing. Yeah, it's a, it's a medical issue. It's like a disease. Well, what can we give them for it? Well, we'll give them, you know, these drugs here and okay, so all of a sudden, you know, the hyperactive little kid who's just kind of fun and maybe a little disruptive is now medicalized. And it's the same thing with the, you know, the autism spectrum, you know, people say, well, you know, increase in vaccinations.

Speaker 2:          01:48:14       There's been an increase in autism, not really. The category got larger and it became medicalized, you know, so. So there's no increase in autism cases. It's the increase in the diagnoses of them at a more people paying attention to it and be the categories much bigger than it used to be. So that's why it's called a spectrum. So when people make the correlation between that and the increase in the amount of vaccinations to children, it's a false correlation. Yeah. It says it's not true that the, that autism rates have gone up. It's that in the, in the nineties it's suddenly started becoming a thing, autism, the spectrum, talking about it. And so somebody that was like so called asperger's, they're a little socially awkward. Is that a word burglary? Yeah. Well, I'm pretty sure I've heard the dude's a little ass burglary when someone's like really smart, but socially to go to caltech or mit, you know, the big bang theory is not so far off on the nerdy fact.

Speaker 2:          01:49:14       Yes. But, but again, it goes along with being false correlation. What's wrong with being a little nerdy? Well, now it's, you're on the autism spectrum. Yeah. You're on the spectrum that we, the autistic, yet you're, and you have a disease and we have drugs for this. And before you know it, the categories bigger than there's more people in the box. So it looks like it got bigger, but it didn't. If you're easily distracted also add. Yeah. Uh, you have a disease, you have add, sir, you need to take, they call it a dos to attention deficit. Uh, oh, shiny, right. Does that. So, but there have been. There's

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       also the very real problem with human beings in that there's so much biological diversity that medication that affects one person is going to affect another person that totally different way. So if they give you a medication or your body has no problem with that medication whatsoever, they give that same medication to another person. There's going to be some issues. And when people say, well, you know, my child got vaccinated and some, there was some adverse reaction to the vaccination. There's, there's people that want to immediately dismiss that and say, well, that's malarkey. That's junk science. But there is a very real situation that happens with human beings where they take medication where it does not agree with some of them. Sort of how, like some people have allergies to things that are completely innocuous to were I, you give, uh, a certain type of nut to jamie and he might die.

Speaker 3:          01:50:34       You know, there's, there's a reality to that. And when you look at the, this is what I've tried to explain to people that you talking about vaccinations being dangerous and you know, we don't need vaccinations than other horrible the people. And all the, all the people that have like think about how many people you're talking about, you're talking about 300 million in this country alone. How many cases have, are people that have vaccInations where things go wrong? Is it a thousand a year? Well, if it is a thousand a year, do you know how low that is? I know that's not low. If it's your child, it's awful. I know it's not love. It's 10 a year. If it's your child, it's awful. But there's a lot of fucking People that are being vaccinated. If there really was this global epidemic of you give kids vaccinations and they turn into, you know, the decrepitude, you know, mentally disabled child boy, it'll be a lot bigger.

Speaker 3:          01:51:28       Be a lot bigger than it is because so many people were getting vaccinated exactly the right way to think about a million to one odds happened 300 times a day in America. Yeah, I can't think of it. And that's a lot of people. It's a lot of people just want to try to explain to people. When we talk about just the raw numbers of stupidity, I think that it's really conservative and really kind to say that one out of 100 people are fucking idiots and there's not a damn thing to do. That's really, that's openminded. That's really looking at the bright side of things. That's a glass half full perspective, right? That means there's 3 million morons in this country and we know where they are. That's a lot of people, lot of people. It's the sheer numbers that we deal with. Whenever you know, when, when people started throwing these, you know, these theories around and they use this as their evidence. I always try to just try to put it into that perspective. You just stop and think about the numbers. If you could see it on a board, if you could see 7 billion human beings just as little dots on a board and then you know, then let's, let's find them. All right, then let's, let's look at the problems. Let's look at the. Oh, this is what we're dealing with. We're dealing with is almost insurmountable numbers be like a cancer cluster who accepted to be a stupidity

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       cluster because they're going to cluster in various places, easily cities probably, and they'll find each other and then there's. There's the confirmation bias that comes from the groups getting together and only sharing information that correlates to their beliefs, whether it's big photo ufo lfos or psychics or. That's why it seems like you know, any of these groups that have people are the big foot people or whatever it seems like. Well, there's a lot of people. Yeah, well, you know, there's maybe $100 a night club or something like that, but it's a small number of people compared to the whole population. will they get so mad? They get so mad when you bring this up. If you bring up these facts or this, these thoughts, these ideas, and you tell these people that you don't believe in ufos or you don't believe that we've ever been visited thinking emotionally men, they are connected.

Speaker 2:          01:53:34       They're connected. Yet they're, they're, they're, they're connected. Like who they are is connected to these Beliefs and the more psychologically invested you are in unbelief, the harder it is to change your mind. so this was, this is again an example of cognitive dissonance which was discovered by leon festinger and uh, december of 1954 on the 21st, he went to the top of a hill with a ufo cult who was waiting for the mothership to come. And he wanted to see, well, presumably the mothership is not going to come. The world won't come to an end. What will they do afterwards? So he thought, well, I mean, well, they just changed their mind when they go home, whatever. So he recorded this and wrote a book about it called when prophecY fails. And the answer is they doubled down on their belief that they say, well, this was a dumb idea.

Speaker 2:          01:54:19       Let's go home. You know, they went home and started recruiting more people and while we miscalculated a, it was eastern standard time. It was tomorrow night or it's next year. We've got to carry the one when we did our end of the world calculations. And so, and so they recruit more people to join the group, so he called this cognitive dissonance that, you know, when you have a Belief that conflicts with the facts, uh, what gives well, the facts have to give because the belief is right. So we're going to get a spin doctor, the fact that, you know, we know. And so the rationalizations are just while we prayed and, and, and therefore god saved us, or this was a test of our faith and god allowed us to live or, or my favorite. The world didn't end. And this is the new space. It was a spiritual and dean.

Speaker 2:          01:55:03       And we're in the new. That's the loophole that the December 21st, 2012 people. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. That one was one of my essay. Right? And yeah. Spiritually in this new beginning, new beginning. Yeah. Yeah. I had a guy that I had a conversation with who really was absolutely adamant that the world was going to change december 20, first 2012. He's like, it is undeniable. It's going to happen. I'm like, how can you say that? How can anybody say that? It's definitely going to happen because it did change the day, started getting longer after on December 22nd, but it's also that the people that came up with this idea, their culture doesn't even exist anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       I mean, you're talking about the mayan civilization, wonderful, spectacular, advanced civilization that did all this amazing architecture and they had these really cool statues that they had built and really interesting language that was sort of like hieroglyphic, you know, what, what, what is it called? The. It's a what does the type of language that they use, but like where each, each symbol symbol a symbol simpler, but each symbol has a certain sound that's attached to it so you can have those symbols connected in different ways. It's really interesting when there was a, I'm a believer as a national geographic documentary on trying to decode, I think it was called. Yeah. And these guys were, they were trying to figure out exactly what these people were writing and how they wrote it. Amazing. I'm actually one of my, uh, cycling trading partners. Nicco his father, michael coe at yale university.

Speaker 1:          01:56:42       He was the guy that first crack the mayan code, so I blamed his dad for, for all this end of the world stuff. Yeah. Basically it was a. It was a cyclical, a time cycle instead of a times arrow that is these ages repeat themselves in these long, long, long form cycles and that december 20, first 2012 was to whatever extent it was coming to an end. It was just a period of time, like almost like our year comes to an end and a new year start. Alls it is is the calendar is rolling over the next phase, the end of the long count for the long couch and what happened is those people nothing. They just quit talking about it. I mean, no, almost no one ever says, you know what? I was wrong. People just sort of drop it and go out. I'm not into that anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:57:26       Well, It was an industry that december, 21st thing was in industry for awhile and I thought it was awesome. I loved it. I thought it was cool. I even had a license plate and it said December, 2012. I had a license plate he did because I thought it was hilarious. It is hilarious, but it's also cool, like it's kind of fun to think that it's really going to happen. Like people have these ideas. That's when the aliens are going to return. That's what we're going to become self aware. I think terence mckenna believed that's when people are going to come up with a time machine. It was a bunch of like really fascinating ideas. What the hell was going to go down. But there seems to be this longing that people have for an event that we're building towards an event. Well, the idea is there's two dueling ideas is the idea of progress in history and decline in history.

Speaker 1:          01:58:09       And so when people write about it, it's usually we're in a period of decline. It's like, like republicans right now, you know, America is the greatest nation ever except it's in a shit hole. It's the worst it's ever been now because of this guy. But, but, but, but before we're going to return back to the way it used to be. Great. So every generation has this. Ours is the special generation, either ours is culminating in this great thing that's going to happen or things are terrible, but if we could get through that, they were the ones that are going to come out the other side, the born again, you know, the left behind hers,

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       uh, you know, that, you know, the christian apocalypse, you know, there's plenty of secular versions of this. You know, mark'S has had this idea that, you know, the end of capitalism in the beginning of socialism and communism. This is a big stage thing. Um, you know, there's a lot of science. Fiction is like this, it, it, it makes a drama better when there's a beginning point and end point. We're at this crisis moment and things are going to be great again or, or, or they're going to come to an end and they'll be great. But there's always that tension between decline and progress with is also this realization that there will be an end for you. That we are finite beings. We have a beginning, we're born, we have an end, we die and it's gonna happen. So when is it happening? I don't know what I'm fucking scared.

Speaker 2:          01:59:25       It's something coming. Oh, it's coming. The apocalypse. All, jesus. Here it is. And then we find this thing and if you're really inclined to be gullible, you know you get sucked into like the heaven's gate folks think, well, the way it's going to happen is there's a ufo behind this media and what we got to do is when the comment is near, we gotta kill ourselves and wear purple nike's and then we'll live our art bell has a little bit of culpability in that because he was promoting the hale bopp comet ufo theory for quite a while on his show and they used to listen to that show and that's when they bought. They went down and bought a a telescope and to see if they could see it and they. And so I'm in. I'm not blind to it, but I got into it by listening to that theory.

Speaker 2:          02:00:08       Promoted our bell. Yeah. So then when marshall applewhite said, you know, I think this is it. This is all going to come with the comet and comedy albums and little competition when it comes to cult leaders, it seems like once a cult leader has like that position, like the, they very rarely get forced out of the board, you know? No one says, you know, what? Marshall's out of his fucking mind. I'm not cutting my hair off because they were treating themselves and you know, and he was obviously. So nadine, like, did you not have one person in that group that you might have thought like, well, maybe, maybe mike's got some better ideas in martial arts and mike doesn't work that way. Usually those ones get purged. Like in the mormon fundamentalist mormons. They just purge anybody that wants to challenge the, the elite, the profit.

Speaker 2:          02:00:57       But so there's a critical point and every cult when the leader dies a well, okay, what happens? Usually the cults just die with him. But in the case of scientology, uh, wait, what are you saying? Scientology is a call. Sorry. Whoa, dude. We're in hollywood. I do know that once you watch your mouth, you know, and uh, uh, when Joseph Smith was killed, that could have been the end of the mormon church, but bring them young, took over the reigns. So if there's another charismatic leader, david miscavige and david miscavige took over from l, ron, and he was charismatic and people turn their, you know, they, they acknowledged him as the, as the new leader. And one of my favorite moments in all of comedy

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       is when miscavige and tom cruise or on stage and they salute l ron hubbard, lrh, and they saluted. There was a lot of testosterone and right there on that stage like, oh boy, man, he's got a big, gigantic embarrassing. Not embarrassing at all. So wonderful to me when this, the, the, the human folly of it all. You know, the belief system of anybody that's an intelligent person by the way, massively successful, especially financially, both of them financially, but tom cruise culturally massively, massively successful, wearing a big gold plate on his neck and saluting one of the worst science fiction authors of all time. I mean, it is amazing. Not to mention when he died, he was, he was a packed up with antidepressants and other drugs. Allegedly. Again, it's exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Well, not only that, how about the fact that he lived for a long time on a boat off the shore because he owed so much taxes they couldn't land.

Speaker 1:          02:02:41       Right. So like that's where all the c corp and all that crazy shit. He wrote more books than anyone who's ever lived. He wrote more fiction than anyone ever. Yep. A mad fiction. Horrible fiction. Right. Harlan ellison, who I know is a science fiction writer, says he was there at the meeting when l ron. Well, the, the, the meme is that he said if you really want to make money writing science fiction, you started your own religion, but actually was according to harlan ellison is there was a group of them just sort of sitting around complaining about the, the, the, the, the fees that people paid. Writers. Like all of us writers complained about we don't make enough money. And so that's when somebody said, well, you know, if, if we started a religion and then they'll run, kind of jumped in and said, yeah, yeah, let's start a really.

Speaker 1:          02:03:26       And then he actually went out and did it, whereas the rest of them, you know, they just kept writing science fiction. have you read a going clear red glow going clear? I saw the film, I mean films good. Really the nana's because they have time to go into depth about his past and all the stuff that transpired before he created scientology was given these film, right? Alex gibney film and lawrence wright's book. That's right. Yep, yep. Yeah, laWrence. Right. It's a great dirt now that's real investigative journalist when you sink your teeth into those thing and bold, right? Yeah. Yeah. And it's amazing. He got away with it, you know, because there are people trying to do that. Back in the eighties, there was a guy from time magazine that did the cover story with the volcano erupting on it, and he was harassed and threatened and people put stuff in his mailbox and pizza.

Speaker 1:          02:04:12       Different world now though, first of all, their numbers have drastically declined. Scientology's numbers have declined and then on top of that the internet is exposed it for what it really is. RIght. The before we did not like I went to one of these things in san diego, but just a few years ago, I think it was like was say like seven, seven years ago, they had one of these things where you had the e meter and you sat down there were given a free personality tests and I sat down and talked to the guys and they seem kind of like bored and disinterested and weird, but you don't see those at all anymore. You don't see those. I don't think they even do that anymore. Oh, they do? There's one that well on on hollywood boulevard right down there, but building a. No, you could. I've seen he meters on the street.

Speaker 1:          02:04:58       On the street. Yep. Jamie. Right in front of a chinese theater after the going. I asked the guy about that. Have you seen this movie night and see that movie all propaganda. Yeah, that's right. I ordered a book late night tv in 1994 dianetics. I was like, I was going to Anthony Robbins self help stuff trying to, trying to get ahead in this life, you know, young man and I ordered that dianetics book. Those people never stopped sending me shit, never stopped sending me invites and this. And did they get the numbers so we have millions of followers because anybody that ever, I guess I'm a farmer on the list or was it. Well, so they don't have my new address. You can still go clear if you would like to, to be clear. I had a neighbor, it's a horrible story. Poor guy, nice guy.

Speaker 1:          02:05:47       But his, um, I think poem, I think he still lives down the street, but anyway, his um, there was a plot of land that he wanted to buy and we were talking about it, you know, and he's like, well we can't do it right now because nancy's about to go clear. It was like, what? What does that mean? I didn't know what it meant. Oh, you know, wouLd have been okay. I, I only knew this, you know, it was probably [inaudible] 98. I only knew a little bit about scientology. It's like, what do you mean go and clear? Both were scientologists. I go going clear how much that cost $50,000. $50,000 for like some ceremony. And I go, well, what does it involve? Well, she's no longer affected by external influence, so once she goes clear, nothing will bother her. Like you can say anything to her, you could insult her and nothing will get in and she will write.

Speaker 1:          02:06:34       But that's what everybody wants, right? everybody wants this, this, the, the ability to be autonomous, to be, they just completely, completely free of any bullshit in this life, this distress and the worry and the negativity. So they sell you on that. Like these are the things you need to get rid of. Oh, I didn't even know. I mean, part of the, he made her thing, you know, it's just, it's just measuring the voltage between your hands and skin conductance. Um, but, you know, think about your mother. Okay? I'm thinking about my wu spiked because I squeezed his hand slightly more. All right, let's talk about your mind. well, everybody has issues with parents with x levers and spouses and bosses and you can find something and it's like, would you like to get rid of that bad? Well, you know, if you go meditate, you know you go to a buddhist center, they'll tell you the same thing. You're focusing on the negative of your past. We're going to clear that out by meditating. So they're all very various forms of the same kind of thing. Like everybody has. Like the psychic hotlines, everybody has problems, love health, money, car. Everybody's got some issue and we're going to help for

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       a fee. Well, what's fascinating about l ron is it seems like l rom was nuts. I shouldn't use the word not. He had some mental problems, mental problems, and it seems like part of what scientology was, was his attempt at self help and that was one of the things that Lawrence Wright went into that it seems pretty clear that this guy used all these available psychological techniques at the time to try to cure himself self help thing. I think a lot of people go into psychotherapy because they themselves, oh yeah, uh, you know, have issues that they're dealing with. When I was in college, that was the only thing that was interesting to me. It was psychology was interesting to me because I was trying to figure out my own brain. I was like, god, I got a great fucking thing under, under wraps being handled.

Speaker 2:          02:08:20       So that was the, that was the one thing. Robin's uh, you know, they kind of have a tracking the line between being a con artist. He's not but selling something that could maybe help people maybe. But if you follow his direction, I think he, he's more positive than negative. I, I agree. I agree. I mean, some of this stuff is pretty basic, you know, set goals and write them down and don't get distracted from these things. Stay focused, you know, just pretty basic stuff that actually is true. It works if you work at, and we did a story on the self help movement and skeptic by a guy wrote a book called sham, the self help and actualization movement and the pr and this guy he used to work for rodale press, which is one of the big publishers of self help books and in the marketing department said that the number one predictor of anybody who would buy one of these self help books is somebody who had already bought a self help book.

Speaker 2:          02:09:18       Well, if they work, why do you need to keep buying the tapes and the books and all that stuff. And the answer is, is that it? They only Work temporarily. Like if you bring tony robbins into your corporation, he is for sure going to get your sales force really motivated, man, I'm going to make some common, make 50 calls a day rather than 30 calls a day and I'm going to really do this and they see a spike for a while and then people go back to their baseline where they were and that's why you got to keep listening to the tapes and, and, and, and listening to the music and the books and all that stuff to kind of keep it up. So it only works to a certain extent and for a limited period of time. Well it's very difficult for people to change behavior patterns.

Speaker 2:          02:10:00       You have this pattern. They're very comfortable. It's very hard to change too, right? Don't they say it's like 90 days of doing something all the time for it becomes a habit. It's like you can kind of ingrain a new path probably longer than that. It's why diets are so difficult to work. You know, you have a lifetime of, you have this fat level and you know this kind of food your body's used to. And to shift it, it, it's not going to happen in weeks or months. He really, it's a lifestyle change for forever. It really turned into a dial. You can commit to a diet for a long period of time. But a lot of people in the community, like I have a, I'm on a diet

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       right now for 60 days. Mark sisson's primal blueprint. It's like, it's sort of a ketogenic diet. Okay. Based, um, mostly hit a lot of fucking avocados. Dude. Avocados, mct oil, a lot of coconut oil, almond butter, a lot of healthy fats. Like what'd you have for breakfast this morning? I have five eggs and avocado. You did. So you don't worry about cholesterol? No. Yeah, pussy bro. I'll be clinton dot clinton lost all that weight. Get ready. Was cardiovascular? Yeah. He wouldn't be pended. Yeah. What did he do? He's vegan. He went vegan is all plants. He says basically huge salads a twice a day. That's just great for you, period. That was great. Great for you. If you can eat more plants more the better. But um, figure adding more than plants. So coconut butter and no. Well, the idea of systems idea is an system was a big ultra endurance guy as well.

Speaker 1:          02:11:35       It's the idea is that your body functions more efficiently on high fat content and it does on a high carbohydrate content. So it's very low carbohydrate, no added sugar, no grains whatsoever, right? No pastas, no. Here's what's interesting about it. Um, the mental clarity aspect of it is really interesting. Different. Yeah. And I had a few friends that have tried the same diet and it was one of the things they pointed out and I think there's a certain amount of brain fog that comes from heavy carbohydrate meals you avoid, you avoid. And then once Your body becomes into a state of ketosis, which I think takes like 20 something days or there's, there's a bunch of different supplements like see this stuff right here. This is a keto genic cream. The product that you can add to coffee, there's a bunch of different. That's what you're putting in ketones now.

Speaker 1:          02:12:26       That is actually just because this stuff is coffee with mct oil and grass fed butter. Have you ever had that step before? Is that what it's, uh, from um, uh, robb wolf invention, he figured out how to add grass fed butter, mct oil, which is a medium chain triglycerides, essentially the healthiest aspects of coconut oil. My headaches gone, hey, you feel better? But um, it's just a healthy fats and mixed in with coffee mate. No, I'm okay. Yeah, yeah. Alright. But mostly I'm hearing my theory on diets that they work because you're doing something, you're actively involved in keeping track of how many calories you go in and you start cutting out the bad foods. Definitely junk food, sugars, grained, stuff like that. And they work. It doesn't matter if it's this particular one here, this one, the air, it's the doing something about a problem that that is what really works it. Well, I didn't even have a problem. I did it. Just try it. I did it just because I wanted to feel what it would be like. Yeah, try this diet because I had

Speaker 3:          02:13:31       read about citizen and he's a really interesting guy and then I'd also listened to a tim ferris podcast. Tim ferriss had this great podcast With dr d'agostino. I believe his name is who is. I'm heavily into ketosis ketogenetic diets and the science behind it. He's a really, really brilliant guy and fascinating podcasts. we have to listen to it like 10 times in a row and take notes, but one of the things that they brought up, which is really interesting is the, the mental benefits of it and the fact that it helps children with epilepsy when they put them on a ketogenic diet. It stops epilepsy in its tracks. I don't know about that one. Yeah, no, it's a. This is, uh, this is, I've researched it. It's really, really fascinating. It's one of the main things they do to children that have child's epilepsy. Other thing that people do when they get on dice, they also start exercising, which has other benefits.

Speaker 3:          02:14:21       That's tons of benefits. But I did that already too. So for me it was, it was just wanting to try, want to try it for the athletic benefit, wanting to try it for the physical benefit. But I lost a lot of body fat. You did? Yeah. And I wasn't fat, but I definitely could have lost a little bit of weight, you know, but I mean not compared to like I still have a six pack, like you can see my abs before I did it, but I lost 10 pounds. Now I'm down to one. I think it was one 93 this morning and I was somewhere around two. Oh four before. Okay. It's kinda kinda fascinating. And well, will you have for lunch? Um, it's, it depends, but no grains. That's the big one. The big one is no grains, no pasta. No. No. You know, just very low carbs.

Speaker 3:          02:15:02       Like I'm getting my protein from mostly wild game. Mostly a elk and deer and things along those lines while hunting here. Shoot your ass. I don't necessarily do it all here. It's hard. No. Santa monica canoga park. That's not really a lot of meat to you if you had out here walking around, but I do. But when you shoot an elk, you get hundreds of pounds of meat to commercial freezers in the backfield. Well, yeah, you live nearby. I'll give you some. Okay. It's delicious. It'S great for you too. All rIght. You know, it's organic. One hundred percent free of any antibiotics like bullshit buffalo and fosterage. Ostrich meat is very, very, very good for it. Very lean and healthy and it's a rich, dark red meat filled with iron and nutrients. But, um, the idea behind it is that you get your body to burn fat instead of carbohydrates because that's primarily with human.

Speaker 3:          02:15:53       that's why it's not to be confused. Like the problem with the whole concept of paleo, you know, the paleo diet, well, the term can be debunked pretty easily because they say, well, in the paleolithic period, people ate a lot of bread, they eat a lot of state, whatever they could find. Yes, yes. And, and, and most hunter gatherers, most of their calories come from the gathering part, not the hunting part. It's hard to hunt animals. They don't want to be killed. So it's, especially back then they shitty bows and arrows and they didn't have guns was very difficult unless you stumbled upon a herd of blind buffalo,

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       throw a spear out. Right? It's not that easy. No, I mean it's, it's difficult today. Defined, really healthy. I mean if you wanna, if you want to hunt it yourself, good luck. It's a lot of effort. Right. You know, and if you want to actually find really healthy meat other than grass fed beef, their options are pretty severely. What about alcohol? Do you drink? Very little because every now and then, but there's sugar in that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It converts to sugar. Well the idea is that cookies and ice cream, because that's got sugar is gone. So the dairies. Okay. milk a. Hey, you can have belt, but I'm not really sure. I've never liked milk cookies, but since I'm not eating cookies and milk. Yeah. Milk guy. Yeah. I don't mind raw milk and milk. I like, I felt like homogenized and pasteurized milk.

Speaker 1:          02:17:20       Once you do that, I mean it's great as far as you could store it in a store and it lasts for a long time, but you're cooking out all the enzymes. Right? It's just not the best thing for your body. Yup. Problem also is if you don't do that then it's only good for a couple of days, so. Right. ThAt's. And you get sick and eggs. Good. I'm glad to hear that. I like eggs. Eggs are good for you, man. Yeah. Eggs aren't bad and certain amount of cholesterol is actually important for your body. Produce testosterone. This actually, you know, for cellular growth. Right? So and eggs, the one I get from my chickens, I have chickens. You do? Yeah. That's great. That's good. Good for you. It's 22 chickens. What about supplements? That takes up my fish oil, multivitamins, omega, omega six to three. Yeah, it took a lot of.

Speaker 1:          02:18:12       That is something that can go too far or something like ray kurzweil it takes to. Oh yeah, supplements a day, but he's just trying to stay alive and terrorist. Sheens take right now. I know I interviewed him for example, he's kind of a girl. He's almost like a secular guru because he's constructed this, you know the second coming is coming, the singularity, it's 20, 30, 20, 41, 42. If you could make it till the year 20, 47 or 2014. I went to a conference in, it was the same for the same show for um, uh, joe rogan questions, everything. We went to New York and they had this big conference. I interviewed him and said, oh, the singularity summit. Yeah. Well I don't remember. I think it was 20 slash 40 something. Whatever the fuck it is, 20, 40. They just pick a day when they think that it's all going to happen.

Speaker 1:          02:18:55       But they had this, a russian billionaire character who would develop some artificial, some thing that, you know, he was uh, gonna unveil that was like a robot of him. It's going to be an artificial intelligence, but it wasn't ready, you know, say even if thAt will come eventually I think. But even if they did accomplish that, would it be you or just a copy of. You see, like when you go to sleep and you wake up, you're a little groggy, but there's a continuity. It's still your memories and your personal life. When you go under general anesthesia, you're groggy after you wake up and it's still, there's a continuity, but if they shut off your brain and turn it back on inside a computer, would you wake up and go, oh, well, okay, this is like waking up or would it just be you're gone and it's just a copy and this copy's just functioning completely on its own and it has no idea what it's doing because it's not connected to biology.

Speaker 1:          02:19:48       It's not connected to all the same. it should, you know, maybe there's like a leap of faith they have to make before they hit the switch. I'm not sure that that. I think the problem of identity is a serious one for people in terms of longevity, in terms of immortality will not only that. How about the fact that if I can make one, michael shermer, if I can copy you have one or I just spam you when I spam you all over europe have a million. Michael shermer is all throughout India. That's, that's a real problem, right? I mean, if you can mAke a copy, if you want to be immortal and you want a copy, what's to stop someone from making multiple copies with you? Stop Donald Trump and right? Well, so far nobody. But if he wants to make a bunch of donald trump's maniac was just the moment you turn on the new copy, uh, they start having different memories because they're in a different environment than a different body and they're having different interactions.

Speaker 1:          02:20:39       And so if it's a bioLogical system, then there's new neural connections growing that are different than yours than the joe rogan copy. So that's no longer you, you might have the same past memories, but you're now going to have different. Just like twins. Yes. Nobody thinks twins are identical in person in personhood illegally. They're treated as separate entities. And, and of course that is right. So I think that's really what, what copies a ai copies will be. It's just like twins. That's a good point. That's a good point. Also, the good point is from here on out, you're going to have different life experiences. So if you made it an exact duplicate of yourself at this day, but one went to New York and the other one moved to miami, you have totally different lives, totally different experiences, totally different blends going to be liberal, one's going to be conservative, you're going to make different conclusions based on your life experiences, and that's just the reality of being a person is that we're constantly accumulating data and processing it and then also it's the environment that you surround yourself with as far as the unique individuals that you choose to associate with.

Speaker 1:          02:21:41       They flavor who you are so much. RIght. It's almost inseparable. It's so. It's so difficult to look at a person as an individual because every individual is profoundly influenced by all the other people around them. Right? So you take this individual, you move them to montreal and you surround them with a bunch of people that are totally different from them. They learned french, they started speaking with the quebecois and next thing you know they're there. It does a totally different human being. Right? You become different because of the People that you're around. Exactly. You know, you don't even exist in a vacuum, right? So, so in terms of like trying to achieve in mortality, like the military ones or the transhumanists, um, or the extropians, they're against entropy. Oh really? Oh yeah. What's their theory? It's a little bit

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       like the transhumanist that we're going to slowly replace our body parts and in now, not just new joints, but you know, if you would replace your nerve cells and as long as you still have to have the continuity, it's still you as a person in there. I'm just uploading it to another platform. Is, is. I don't think it's going to do it. I think it's not you anymore. The johnny depp inside the computer. Turn it on. Transcendence theory is. I don't think that can happen right now. I may be wrong. There are people that do think this can happen but doesn't have to be you. Can it be like something you, you personally one, right? It'S like woody allen said, I don't want to live on through my work I want to live on, in my apartment. Uh, somebody said one of his many lines about immortality.

Speaker 2:          02:23:12       Yes. Um, you inside the computer, the copy of you, a copy of you is just the extension of your work, you know, it's like, this is a little bit of a copy of me, my books and so on, but it's not me. Right. and after I'm gone, the books are still around, but it's not really me. I don't feel like I'm still going. Isn't there a problem with, if you believe in evolution, which I assume you do and you, you assume that people are going to continue to change shape, we're going to continue. I mean if we used to be multicell organisms that are coming out of the muck, the primordial ooze and now were people, what, what are we going to be a million years from now? are we going to stifle that and just lock ourselves into this form? This is not a perfect form.

Speaker 2:          02:23:57       One of the arguments is that we should, we should take over evolution and we are. so genetic engineering for examPle, right now everybody's afraid of, oh, they're going to make ariens or whatever. Okay, let's just, let's just allow it to happen to solve alzheimer's, cure cancer, things like that. Then we can worry about uploading, you know, more intelligence into our cortex. Say for, for what if we do to people what we've done to tomatoes, make them boring and flavor, flavor, flavor to last longer. That could happen. that's actually a good point. People, we did tomatoes, we fucked up tomatoes, but they last forever. Well, in a way with international travel in the internet now, you know the poorest borders in centuries or so, you know, everyone will look like tiger woods or something like this, you know, I think the racial barriers will eventually dissolved.

Speaker 2:          02:24:44       Well then we'll find some new way to hate each other. Oh, absolutely. You know, humans are super good at that, but if we colonize another planet, say we started colony on mars in, in a way that's a founder population that can then begin to diverge away from the earthly population and in a million years you'd have two different species. Say they could maybe, well they'd probably still be able to integrate because there's still connections. You'd also have a movable men that you've got a whole civilization to people so fucking crazy. They decided to move to mars. It's a self selecting group. They're probably. They're probably not typical. Definitely not. I mean, and they're also going to have to do some crazy geoengineering and we're going to have to hope that that keeps it fun. Scenario would be what kind of government would they set up? What kind of economic system and assuming they were, none of them were religious.

Speaker 2:          02:25:32       If he came back a thousand years from now, would they have a shrine to a god and religion and all this. It happened again and then we'd have the history archetype a. It'd be interesting. It's one of the interesting things about scientology in the mormon church is that we have a clear recent history and a paper trail to see what happened. Videos, but we don't have, but we don't have for christianity is that it's old enough that it's lost in the murkiness of time and it so you can kind of fill in the blanks with miracles and things like that. Here we know Joseph Smith was killed and then brigham young move to Utah to get away from the authorities and you know, and we know exactly how it all unfolded and so you can diagram how to start a religion. well, you know the whole mitt romney story too, but his family in Mexico, right?

Speaker 2:          02:26:17       Oh right, that's right. Yes, I forgot about that. Yeah, I'll move to Mexico when they couldn't have 100 wives. Right. Like, fuck this. We're out of America. Swears his dad bringing me on was originally against polygamy until. Yeah, until he tried it and then he's like, oh, well, one of my favorite books is john krakauer is under the banner of heaven. He's a great writer, but he has a. He kind of reconstructs the moment when Joseph Smith tells his wife emma that he got this revelation from god about polygamy. Celestial marriage. He called it and it basically is already having an affair with this woman down the street. So basically he goes, well honey, you know, I was talking to god and he told me that I'm supposed to have sex with so and so. I know I couldn't believe it either, but my friends, they were all there.

Speaker 2:          02:27:01       They heard it too. They're telling their wives right now. Oh. So ama says something like, well, in that case I'm going to have a extra husbands. He said, now you know, god was really clear about this. It's just for the guys as this gets sold as a viable, a declaration of, of, of revelations. And it's written down. So if you look at the first page of the book of mormon, it's an affidavit, you know, we are the people. We saw the gold tablets and so on. Same thing with the revelation about polygamy all the way until 18, 94 when the state of Utah wanted to become a state. And the federal government said not with polygamy. And suddenly they got a new revelation from god changed my mind about the polygamy thing back to monogamy. Oh, okay, okay. It could be a state, not mitt romney's parents.

Speaker 2:          02:27:47       They're like, we're out of here. So you go to the fringes. Well, Colorado city and that was in the news yesterday. Um, apparently the whole police force, the courts, everybody that lives in this town is fundamentalist mormon. They're polygamous fan. So you, Colorado cities. That's right on the border of Utah and Arizona, Colorado city, Arizona. I think art, maybe it's in Utah, it's right on that road that goes to kayak and um, and we've been there. We race across America. used to go through on a route to get to New York. We'd go through northern Arizona in southern Colorado. Did they tell you? And it's a, it's a community. You

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       drive through there and people are looking at you and it's like, it's like being in a twilight zone or spiles episode, you know, where they drive somewhere. It's like everybody's a little weird and you can see the dress. Clothing is like, everything is off a little bit. Even like at the gas station, at the denny's, it's like there's something not quite right here. That's awesome. I want to go. Oh, it's right now. It's really a. Yeah. I don't think the polygamy should be illegal. I really don't because it's not illegal to live with 20 women. If you just you who hugh hefner it and you decided to have like 20 women live with you, you're a king, you know, but if you signed paperwork with them, then all of a sudden it's a problem. Well, the way they do it as they marry one of them legally and then the rest are so called sister wives and they're not actually married to them so they're not breaking the law and there's no law against having, you know, living with a bunch of women.

Speaker 1:          02:29:11       It's okay, well the law only exists in terms of all the other people outside of their community or their neighborhood or their family recognizing it and it's just a problem with if every. If you have a law that says this, but everybody in the town, including the police captain, the courts, well the judge, they're all in on it. They're all in it. So now I have conflicting feelings about, about my libertarian tendencies. We go, well, adult people should do whatever they want, but why is the government in the marriage business in the first place? I agree, but the problem is when you study the polygamous mormons, you know they. These, these are young girls, this warren jeffs, jessica. He was marrying twelve-year-olds. He was having sex with 11 year olds. Okay. There is a proBlem. That's absolutely a problem. Yeah. Well that's just a problem period with someone who's a grown adult who's having sex with a young kid.

Speaker 1:          02:30:01       That's obviously that goes without saying, but as long as the person's 21 or whatever, I mean, I really think he should probably be 21 before you even allowed to get married. I mean, I probably would have got married if I was 18. My girlfriend when I was 18 at the time said, marry me. I'm breaking up with you. I'd be like, fuck it. Let's do it. Yeah. Yeah. I was lost. Yeah, you're too young. You don't have enough information to be allowed to do anything until they're 30. Probably not even might be fortunate, but the idea that you could tell some adult that they can't sign a piece of paper with another adult. Yeah. I mean, it's just as preposterous to say the same sex marriage should be illegal, right? Why not? Who cares? As long as they're not brainwashed when they're little that they should be.

Speaker 1:          02:30:45       Yes, because then maybe you're 21. Are you really making a rational choice about your future or are you there? That becomes a problem with cults and that's also the problem, and then it becomes, okay, well where's the line? Get gray. Okay, if a mormon can't do it, if you can't take someone when they're really young, raise them as a mormon and then wants to become of age and they become an adult. Tell them now you can get married and you can be involved in this polygamous marriage and well, they grew up in this religion. Are they brainwash even though they're are grown adult? Well, if that's the case, but what

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       about alice ism or whatever and you go, it's the government can't be in the business of judging that. so it's a, it's a, you know, it's a fine line there. It's tough when you put your hand on the bible when you swear to be in a fucking president. Right? Hilarious weakens bible it still lincoln's bible. Well, that's who obama used was the lincoln's bible. Yeah. No, I am i. Am I remembering that was at martin luther king's bible? No, I think it was. Mlk is bible. Yeah. Anyway. Yeah. So, but yeah, that's very telematic. We're touching the past. So dumb as if, you know, the old testament is a font of moral wisdom. Is it the old testament they use? Well, the whole thing, but is it the new testament, the old testament that he puts his hand on? It's both. It's the bible that includes both that polygamy was, you know, all the great patriarchs.

Speaker 2:          02:32:07       There was a study by Helen Fisher now. It was a different anthropologist on um, uh, the relationshiP between power and sex in the old testament and basically the more power you had more women and wives and girlfriends and concubines and children you had, how unusual. And solomon was the, you know, he was going for wilt chamberlains record there. He had 700 wives, 300 concubines, and you know, thousands of kids, I guess. Well, allegedly, allegedly, but I mean, it wasn't, no, uh, 600 years old. So it's hard, right? I mean, most of the stuff probably didn't actually happen in the old testament. Probably moses never existed, but the point is that, that is the way men treated women, that, that was the patriarchal society at the time. Slavery was legal, polygamy was legal. The more power you had, the more wealth you had, the more women you have, the more children you had it.

Speaker 2:          02:32:57       That was the world of the old testament, you know, and that's not the world we live in now. So why are we still using this book? Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's, nobody would embrace, you know, christian today, I would embrace most of the stuff that's in the bible. They just wouldn't. So when they say I get my morals from the bible, it's like, no, no, you don't. And that's a good thing. You're getting your morals from the same place. We nonbelievers get it. Uh, and you know, we were inculcating it from culture, from the enlightenment secular values. Well, I'm glaD you brought that up because that was an article that I've read that you had written about islam, that islam was the only religion that had not gone through the advertisement. Right? Yeah. I think that was a really, really interesting article and a very important point.

Speaker 2:          02:33:37       You know what I mean? Christianity, they used to be head jews, uh, and witches were burned at the stake, you know, I mean the kinds of stuff isis does today. Christians used to do that centuries ago. It's very common and they stopped. Why? Well, the law changed. That culture changed and the enlightenment era ushered in secular values that all people should be treated equally under the law that people are born with equal rights and, and, and, and so forth. And, and that all changed everything and everybody is incorporate. Just thinking about, I'm a member when the owners, a former owner, the clippers, donald sterling made these remarks, you know, but most old guys thought like that just 50 years ago and weren't particularly.

Speaker 1:          02:34:19       His remarks were pretty, pretty innocuous. What he has said, he had a girlfriend, this is, this thing has been blown out of proportion so bad and yet he had a girlfriend and he asked her not to take pictures with these guys. These black guys. He said in the same sentence, you can fuck them. I don't care if you fuck them, just don't take pictures with them. It was already said. Yeah, they need to clear that part. Print any of that. Right. And everybody was talking about the the don't take pictures of the black eyes. He said he knew what he was saying was that you're sticking it in my face that you're fucking on these guys. I don't care if you fuck them. Just don't take pictures of. I don't want to see it. Right. Saying this to his girlfriend in the privacy of his house.

Speaker 1:          02:34:59       He didn't use any racial slurs. He didn't say anything terrible. All he said was, don't take pictures of these guys because she was a slow. Allegedly, she's banging a bunch of dudes and he didn't care because he's like 80 years old. He's like buying or condos and rolls royces and shit. He just, he just wants to keep banging her because she's hot, right? So he's like, I don't care for him. Look, you're still have higher standards. That guy's, he looks like jabba the hutt. He's like, his face has fallen off his bones. Right. So for that poor guy, I mean that last him, his, his team, which is insane. But it shows you how far we've come. And again, most people, most old guys in the fifties would have thought nothing about saying that publicly. Yeah. But apparently he was pretty racist and that what they caught him with a small little slice of what he had done.

Speaker 1:          02:35:48       This is obviously allegedly blah blah blah. But apparently it wasn't a nice guy, which is why this was so reinforced and why people went after him so hard. They're like, look, we got him which has run with this and obviously it's a pr nightmare, but yeah, people evolve. And I think now in today's day and age, that kind of thinking like racist thinking justifiably so is gross. It's frowned upon absolute learning we are learning yet. Yeah. So I mean the moral arc, that's what that's about tracking, you know, how much moral progress we've made over the centuries, particularly just the last 50 years and the civil rights movement. It's one reason why I think all these campus protests, I've gotten so out of hand there so disproportionate because the students have a moral, a module there still passionate about making the world a better place, but all the big stuff's been taken.

Speaker 1:          02:36:38       It's all done. Did it down to halloween costumes, taco tuesdays, he wore a sombrero. Cultural appropriate, you know, they're all fired up about what they view it as just like safe spaces. That's where ideas go to die. I mean, come on. It's safe spaces such such a stupid argument. Any argument that's worth it, it has to stand on its own merits. You have to be able to discuss things like having a university where you can't discuss ideas, would even even bad ideas. Bad ideas should be debated. The idea that they won't let these conservatives perform or speeches at the universities and they tried to shut them down, scream at people. They. They hit fire alarms. I mean, it's madness. It's, it's everything that you're not supposed to do when you're defending and exploring ideas. I think the deeper, the deepest cause of this is, is the asymmetry between left and right on, in the academy?

Speaker 1:          02:37:31       Yes. It's in some of these departments. It's 20 to one, a liberal conservative democrat, republican, uh, only in the economics department. The social sciences. do you get something like a balance everywhere else it's super slanted. And uh, so you're, you're, you're getting this added. Well, we know what the truth is. Well, maybe you don't know what the truth is and you need to listen to the other side because that's what has driven science and reason and the enlightenment is, is open open debate because I might not be right. And so the only way to find out is if I ask you your opinion. And so I tell my students, you know, you gotta, you gotta read the wall street journal in addition to the New York times, you got to listen to, you know, conservative talk radio in addition to npr and you gotta you gotta hear it, you know, he listened to rush limbaugh.

Speaker 1:          02:38:15       Oh god, I know he's a knuckle dragging a mouth breather. But somebody on that side just to see what listening to larry elder there. I like larry elder. Yeah, he's a conservative, but he's a little bit more rational. Lot more, little more libertarian arguments are interesting. Yeah. And the only way to know what the other side really thinks because you think, well why do they believe that? Well, you have to listen to their arguments to at least be able to articulate why they're wrong. If you can't do that, then you really don't know why they're wrong. Exactly. Yeah. And find, try to like balance, like look at things through their perspective. Even if you don't agree with their perspective, just relax yourself, relax yourself and allow you. Allow yourself To explore the way they think. You know, I, I follow a bunch of wackadoos on twitter just so I can listen to them read their stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:39:06       I follow this one guy, he's a young earth christian who, uh, every day we'll talk about how horrible obama obama's the death in this country and I will follow this guy and follow people who retweet him and go to their links and go to their blogs, read their blog or what the fuck just because I'm just trying to explore how their mind works, trying to try to piece together how much of it is just a bold blanket hatred of liberals. How much of it is racism, how much of it is this, how much of it is that? And just trying to objectively assess where their mindset is and what the root of their thinking is. That's what I did back in the nineties when the holocaust denial movement started taking off and uh, these guys were appearing on montel williams and donahue and was like, what? Okay, what is this about? Turns out they're in their offices in costa mesa. So I drove down there and I just sat down with the. They have a little journal of historical review and it's like, all right, who are these guys? So we had beer and pizza, you know, I just started to get them to open up with, what is your story here? right. That's the only way to find out what they're, what's really behind their arguments. okay. They have these arguments, here's why they're wrong. Okay,

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       but why are they making these arguments? The only way to find out is actually talked to them and why were they making their arguments if some of it's at pure antisemitism, but also there's some conspiratorial thinking, you know, the jews are doing this but not just the jews, you know, the media that this. And that is one of those exposing the mystery thing because it's a little bit of that, you know, the government, you know, they don't want us to know. They like, wait, who's the thing? Because that's us, right? Uh, well no, they have the super power and you know, so there's a lot of that behind there. And then also there's some, you know, basically I can get attention by saying this wacko back, the wackadoodle kind of stuff and then people pay attention to me and that feels good and so I'll run with it.

Speaker 2:          02:40:54       No, david irvine was there, a big intellectual and uh, he, he was self trained historian but also a pretty smart guy, good writer. And he wrote some, his early stuff on, on gerbils and, and some of the stuff on the second world war was, was, was quite good. But then he found he wasn't in the academies, self-taught and just published his own books and kind of made a living doing that. And he found that when he started migrating toward this, you know, maybe hitler didn't know about the holocaust and it was really gerbils and himmler and they're the ones that did it and hitler didn't know. You've all of a sudden he gets all this attention and then he, he concocts this idea of I'll give a thousand dollars to anybody that can show me the order from hitler to, to orchestrate the holocaust. You know, I hereby command, we exterminate the jews.

Speaker 2:          02:41:40       Okay. There is no such order, there's no single point. It's a whole conglomerate of little steps along the way from sterilization of the feebleminded in the early thirties all the way up to gassing them. Okay. There's like a hundred steps in between so there is no single order, but that got him all this attention and all of a sudden he's a big star at these conferences where these people meet. so I went to some of these and it's like, whoa, okay. He is being worshiped as this great scholar and and you could sort of see how it fed, fed the ego, get a lot of attention. So I think that we can't discount it. Just appear psychology of getting some attention for your views as pushing people further than they would normally go. Yeah, I think that'S a very, very good point because there's a, there's a massive attraction to that is people are massively attracted to anything that can get them a lot of attention.

Speaker 2:          02:42:31       Even for a ridiculously controversial idea. Have you paid attention lately and this is one of the most confusing things that's been going on. There's a gang of people that believe the earth is flat. Oh yes. They're paying attention to this. I saw that. Yes. I can't believe that in 2016, this is really a thing. If there is a movement that believes that all of the iss pictures, those are all fake and that all the pictures are just getting attention and nothing more. Do you think they really believe I've watched some videos. these fucking people bullying. Yeah. I have a friend who believes it was loosely based friend. Max everly, you're out there. You fuck. He's a fantastic pool player, but he's out of his fucking mind. He blog postings about it on facebook. I'm like, max, have a conversation with them. Here's a. Here's a good example of why we need free speech.

Speaker 2:          02:43:22       You know, these people should not be centered. Let them say what they want to say and let's, let's show how we do know the earth is round. Let's see. Can you articulate five reasons why the earth is? Why don't you tell max aberly why the earth is located? Okay, max, here's the deal. All right, so first of all, uh, when there's an eclipse, you can see the shadow of the earth on the moon. The lunar eclipse. there it is, it's current. That's the government with a projector. Yeah. But, but you can go out in your own backyard with no good. Okay. NoW what they'll say is, yeah, it's round like a pizza flat round. Exactly. That's what I'm saying. But of course, if that were true, then why are all the continents? Uh, you know, why aren't all the continents located on the one side of the pizza?

Speaker 2:          02:44:02       And if they're on the flip side, how do you get from one continent to another when you do a transcontinental flight? Because it, it, you're curving around it. You're not all of a sudden hitting an edge and then flipping around to the backside of the pizza. And so there's a second reason, uh, if you, if you're high up and you look out, you can see the mass of a ship sailing away. The whole goes first and then you see the mass last because it's curved and it. Anyway. So there's all these. If you put a stick here and 500 miles away, make it. I dunno, a tucumcari New Mexico that's a thousand miles from la. You put a stick there at noon, at the same time they'll have different shadows because the earth is curved, so they're good at 12 noon. It's actually 1:00 in New Mexico when it's 12 noon in la and that's why we have time zones because it's curved.

Speaker 2:          02:44:52       Okay. And so, and when you, when you want to watch a rocket, a space x rocket or nasa rocket launch from Florida, it arcs. It's arcane because it's going into orbit and the earth is curved so you have to arch out. Otherwise it would just go straight up and it doesn't do that anyway. Those are five different, you know, quick reasons is pretty good. But you sound like a shill for this round bullshit government. There was a, uh, the kind of the co-discovered natural selection with darwin guy named alfred Russell Wallace. He was nuts. He was way out there. I wrote my biography on him and he came up with a dream that connected darwin's theories together. Like is darwin's theories and his theories came together like darwin had a problem, right? With natural selection. Who's trying to figure out how to piece it all together.

Speaker 2:          02:45:41       He does. His ideas were not quite there. There is a conspiracy theory about that, that, that, that, that darwin cribbed from, uh, from wallace, I don't think that's the case, what it is for them, but that they sort of combined the simultaneous thing and they were in correspondence. Wallace actually incorporated some of darwin's work. Darwin was older than him and he had already done quite a bit more work than wallace head. And in any case, wallace was super open minded. So here's an example of being too open minded in darwin was open and he came up with new ideas, but he's also very skeptical of the whole spiritual seance movement that was getting big in england. Walsh's wallace, he would go to these seances and hold the hands and the table would levitate in darwin. people don't hear about darwin. We'd just like, I'm not going to us say, are you fucking kidding me?

Speaker 2:          02:46:25       I mean, this is insane. And Thomas Henry huxley, the other great scientists said, you know, pay, pay five shillings to talk to bottle to the dead. I mean, come on, but wallace, oh no, I'm going, this is, this might be true. And uh, so he was in and then he made the mistake of answering an ad in a magazine for a, of one of these flat earthers who said, I give fight, you know, 5,000 pounds to 500 pounds, I guess it was. Anybody can prove the earth is round. So what year was this? This was 18. This was the 18, a psa. 18 eighties. And so while I said, okay, I can do it. So they went to the old bedford canal, which is like 20 miles straight without a band. So you could set up two little telescopes, you know, those little survey or telescopes.

Speaker 2:          02:47:12       And they put a mark on a bridge. Okay. And so when I'm looking. So there's one, two, three marks. If it's straight, then it should be all lined up. If it's curved than the one here. That's exactly three feet above the ground. Like this one here, that's five miles down the road, down the canal, it, it should be lined up. Or if it's not, it's dropped a little bit. And in five miles you could actually measure a little bit of the earth's curve by like, I don't know, it's like a centimeter, half a centimeter or something. Right? There it is, right? There it is. There's the old bedford canal. So wallace did that and they had a neutral judge who looked through the telescope and said, yep, it's curved, it's dropped. And, and this guy that flatter, if they refuse to look through the, I'm not going to look through there.

Speaker 2:          02:47:53       I know you're wrong. And uh, and wallace, he, so he had to sue this guy to collect the prize money. This is why you shouldn't get involved with a wackadoodle people too far because he spent 15 years dealing with this guy and this guy was sending crazy letters to his wife and to the natural geographical. I actually found some of these letters that the national geographical society, uh, this guy threatening, you know, you've got this crazy man wallace working for it. And so on, you know, these, some of these people are, they're a little mentally, as you know, a changed. That's fascinating. But wallace, his ideas converged with darwin's ideas and it kind of helped darwin's theory would disown them eventually. No, no. What, what, what, what, what really happened was it accelerated darwin to get his work done. So you get the book done.

Speaker 2:          02:48:42       He was just sort of lollygagging around doing his research. And one reason for that is I'm in 18, 44, there was a book on evolution published called the vestiges of creation. It was published anonymously and it was trashed by the scientific community. So, so darwin got back from the galapagos in 18, 36 throughout the 1840. He was just taking notes, composing his ideas, running experiments. You've got married and had 10 kids. And he was the, he had a lot of money invested in the railroad. So he was a pretty active independent scholar. And uh, and so I just started taking his sweet time about developing this theory and also he didn't want to be embarrassed and come out with a book that wasn't very solid. And then he would be criticized, so he was just compiling anyway, one day he gets this letter from wallace from the other side of the world is in the malaya archipelagos.

Speaker 2:          02:49:32       I came up with a few ideas that he had like a feverish nightmare from malaria. And he hatched this natural selection. Some species compete with others as the populations increase in a and way. Uh, and so not all of them can survive. Some will survive. Differential reproductive success, natural selection. Boom. So he outlines this to darwin. Darwin is reading this going, oh crap, this is my idea. I mean, he, he sort of outlined like my book. So then he rushed into print. It's like I gotta get this done. So they weren't necessarily collaborating. They weren't exactly collaborating, although they had communicated. And also darwin, not only was wallace not upset about this, he was thrilled. He wrote his mom and said, oh my god, the great charles darwin wrote me back. This is so cool. And then darwin went to charles lyell and some of the other big scientists at the time and said, I got this letter from, from this guy on the other side and you know, I've been working on this.

Speaker 2:          02:50:28       This is really similar and uh, what do I do? So they said, alright, we'll publish both of them simultaneously. And they did on July 1st 18, 58 at the linnean society. They both presented both papers, some of darwin's notes and, and essays he had written in wallaces, no letter to darwin with a little handwritten paper. And they entered in both into the record the same day, july, first 18, 58, boom, simultaneous discovery, wallace darwin. Then spent the next basically nine months. Just the pen moves mighty fast when you're afraid you're going to get scooped, right? Right. And he goT his book done. Boom, november 18 slash 59 origin species. The rest is history. And wallace, he wrote again, is, oh my god, this is so exciting. You know, I'm part of this great movement. And then only later, much, much later did other people start to think, you know, he ripped you off and, and he's like, nah, it's [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          02:51:19       Wallace wrote his great book in 18 eighties called darwinism. So what's really fascinating that he came up with that theory based on a dream from being in a fever state. Yep. How amazing it went. Well, but that often, you know, the spark of a scientific genius or creativity in any field. I was taking a shower and boom, the idea came to me. I was on a walk. So there's some theories about this that if you think too hard and focused on a specific problem, you can't. You have to sort of relax your brain, whatever that means by doing something else that's non focused meditation, taking a shower, going for a walk, going for a bike ride, in my case, anything that's just sort of not thinking about the problem and that we don't know what happens. Maybe some neurons just started to start firing and interacting.

Speaker 2:          02:52:08       Different neural networks. This memory of that, this memory of that, this book, you read, this thing you saw on the internet, boom, boom, boom, they come together. But yeah, we don't know how that happens. It's this writers like to do that. They like to write and then they go for a walk, right? And then after the they're, you know, they're done writing, they go walk and they try not to think about anything and then the ideas will just pop into their head or a correction and the idea or a new revelation and the idea. Yeah, it's just always been amazing to me. Ideas that come out of dreams, like the origins of creativity, like where are these thoughts emanating from what? Like descartes, like the idea of science came from a dream, the dream of uh, you know, being in an elevator, you know, if you're in an elevator and the elevator drops at just the speed of gravity and you let go of your pin or your coffee mug, it's just kinda hover there like you're hovering inside the elevator as it drops.

Speaker 2:          02:53:02       So thE, so the acceleration of the elevator at the speed of gravity means there's no gravity and that's where he came up with this idea of relativity in the elevator is the frame of reference that you and the cup or in. And so this is what weightlessness is when you're, when you do the vomit comet, basically lg as you go up high enough to drop. And so the plane is plunging down for about a minute or two, I guess I've never done it. And you and the camera and whoever else is in there is just floating because the whole frame is dropping. And so to do this in, on the space shuttle for example, it has to go, what? Seventeen thousand 500 miles an hour to maintain, uh, the same speed at which accelerating at which it would also drop. So you're going straightforward and straight down.

Speaker 2:          02:53:48       The halfway in between is 17,500 miles an hour for our planet. That's, that's basically it. I create zero gravity. So if you want to go to mars and, and, and, and have some gravity, you just spin the spaceship. So that yet, so that the floor is the outside wall, that's why in and that's how you get your gravity. That's how you get to grab it, like in 2000, 2000, one or one of them. But space. Honestly, the thing spinning the space station was spinning. So by spinning it creates a false sense of gravity. Uh oh, I know what it was in 2001 where he was running along that curved interior. So it's, it's, it's spinning like this, so it presses against the floor. It's like those old carnival, um, things where you go in and you're standing on the floor, drops out, is it spin and you spent on the outside.

Speaker 2:          02:54:36       That's right. That's the same principle there. Uh, yeah. So it's just amazing that ideas can come out of nowhere. The origin of ideas. That's, that's a fascinating thing to me. Like creativity where, how does one person come up with a great idea for a movie? How does someone come up with an amazing idea for an invention? Like where are these ideas emanating from? Well, first of all, you have to have some knowledge of what it is you're trying to create, you know, you and I have a knowledge of evolution. Yes. he read quite a bit. Yeah, he was totally into this for years as was darwin. So the dream state, even mozart, you know, he was composing since the age of four and his father was a composer. So it's not like this comes out of the vacuum. There's not abused that pops into your head.

Speaker 2:          02:55:19       Um, you know, you and I are going to come up with an einstein type dream because we're not an einstein and we're not physicists and uh, you know, so you have to have the balance seems to be being ensconced in a field to know what the problems are to be solved and what the details are and what's already been done. You know, they tried this to drive this, this didn't work and so on, but not be so entrenched in it that you can't see outside the box and no one knows what that is. We know. No, it's just, it's so interesting. Creativity in and of itself is so interesting because boom, an idea, you know, like where's the, how does that take place? Like what is, what's the birth of the idea, what are the mechanisms that are going on inside the mind that allow the imagination to give birth to this idea that's so it's so poorly understood and part of the problem of trying to understand it is the, what I call the biography by us.

Speaker 2:          02:56:11       We only know abouT the successful people right now. So steve jobs and bill gates. Okay. So the thing is you go to college and drop out, you move into your parents' house, you start a company in your garage, and boom, right? Okay. how many people did this back in the seventies? And we don't even know who they are because they failed all those venture capital startup companies that went out of business. You know, all these great ideas. Okay? So we, you know, we don't know what the formula is a well, not only that, what made you who you are right now at 12, oh, seven was a March 7th or whatever the hell it is. What made you, you, you're 60 plus years of life experiences, you know, being awake for, you know, 18 hours plus a day doing this, doing that. Like what, what chain of events, what foods did you eat, how much sleep did you get?

Speaker 2:          02:57:01       What led these ideas to cross each other and bank and a little fire gets lit and that, and then you write it down on a napkin and your life changes and yet nobody knows too many variables. So fascinaTing. So fascinating. Just the mind and the way the mind works. It's a, it's so, it's such a mystery and yet there's so much information about it at the same time. Yup. Well, it is the hardest problem I think in all of science consciousness. The brain. How does it work? I mean not we know how it works, how the neuro neurons communicate with each other. Neurochemically and how say that your visual cortex is see stuff, but, but what is it that you and I are doing now? just just we're experiencing this process. How does that happen? And that no one knows. We don't have a cogent theory of consciousness, which is why then people step in with quantum consciousness or you know, whatever. They have all these theories because we don't know those people get. They get me baffled. I've had a few of those people and have

Speaker 1:          02:58:01       conversations with people about quantum consciousness and you're like, what? No, I don't even know what you're saying. I don't even know if you know what you're saying. That's exactly right.
