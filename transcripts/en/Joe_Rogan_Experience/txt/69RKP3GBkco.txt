Speaker 1:          00:05          People still rock the bond though, kind of respect that, you know, it's like driving a manual car. I never was a bonger. It's too heavy, man. I got shit to do, man. I can't. Oh, that just fueled down. I remember the Dab thing, the, I got friends in Colorado, California now, the first time I ever did with shit. Uh, this is pretty embarrassing story, but my, I didn't know what it was. You know, I just pulled it like it was a big old bomb rip and they're like, everybody's face. She was like, Oh, you know, it was like, I need, you instantly know you just did something you shouldn't have. Oh No. And uh, I was like, ah, fuck man. So I sat down and looked at a couple of minutes. I just started getting really cold and clammy. I was like, Yup, I'm going to Puke. So I went over, I was like, I'm fucked this guy.

Speaker 1:          00:46          So a puke rightness sink. I was like, dude, I got to go home. I feel like dog shit now. And I'm pretty sure I'm dying. So I had he, we lived in this apartment and I was like, we're out the door and turned the corner to go down the hallway to my, and it was full on vertigo, like the hall. Every time I took a step, the hall we got twice as long. That was like, this is fucked up. My wife was out of the country and work at the time and I was like, I remember was sitting down in the hallway just like trying to get my shit together, man. Cause I was so, I thought I was having a fucking heart attack. It was just like pat, like sweating. And I remember this voice saying, get up you stupid junkie. Fuck before somebody comes out here and sees you, you know, sitting in the hallway like a dumb ass. And I managed to like pop out of it and as soon as I get back to my place and sit down on the couch, everything was fine. I don't, nobody needs to be that stone that fast. I'm sorry.
