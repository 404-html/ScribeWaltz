Speaker 2:          00:07:09       Joe Rogan podcast.

Speaker 4:          00:07:19       I've been working like seven days in a row. Really? Totally bewildered. Excuse me. Cause you said like, like, Hey, I'm in New York. Hey, I'm in Vegas. I'm like, what? Wait, what's going on here? Working like a motherfucker. Dude, that's crazy. I'm trying to get this show done by, uh, which we, we started here in July 16th. How many episodes? Everything we have. Well, is there a conglomeration of him? You know, so like we'll do a one part of one episode, one part of the day and then another part of another episode, another part of the day, it's, they're not necessarily like we do one episode, then we're done and then we move onto another one. We're filming like all six of them at the same time. So we're trying to smush everything together. It's been very interesting. But I just got back from the global future 2045 conference in New York where I got to meet a Aubrey de Grey and all these life extension people in Doctor Amit Goswami that had been on our podcast.

Speaker 4:          00:08:06       He was there as well and a fascinating fucking shit. So you got that where you look at something like global future 2045 where there's all these super geniuses trying to figure out what the future of human life is going to be like and whether or not we'll be able to extend life, download consciousness into computers and all this crazy shit. And then at the same time, David Seaman, he got a lot of fuckery going on, man. We're starting to learn how much surveillance is being, what's the word launched on the American public on a daily basis. I just want to use the end of this one. I feel like every time I come here, I have this hardcore doom and gloom and Glen stuff to share. And you guys are such a positive group in general. So yeah, it's, it's a, it's fucking scary what's going on. It's hard not to take, well, I think it's, it seems to have woken a lot of people up. This is all kind of share that Alex Jones would tell people about in like, you know, 1990 [inaudible] Alex is running around screaming all this shit. And everybody was like, what? No one's checking your email. But you know, no one's done. But it's slowly but surely. It seems to be almost, it seems to be almost inevitable that you're going to get your email look that scary.

Speaker 5:          00:09:25       Obama's over in Europe right now and in Germany, they were really upset about these recent revelations. And in Berlin he gives a speech saying, uh, you know, now let me be clear. No one's reading through ordinary citizens emails. We're not rifling through ordinary people's emails. And you know, he says this on international TV and either doesn't read the news or like does not understand what his own administration is doing because that is what that program does, which is why it caused such an uproar. And similarly, a 12 days ago, he said on national TV in the u s when this first broke, he said, uh, no one's listening to your phone calls. That's not what this program is about. And that's the exact quote that people can look up. And the, uh, you know, that leaked court order from Verizon business services is proof that actually, uh, all of our phone calls are being looked at and they say, just the Metadata, which means who you're calling, who's calling you those phone numbers.

Speaker 5:          00:10:23       Also the duration of the call and your location. Like not even just what building we're in right now, but what floor of the building we're on. That's how accurate this shit is. And they have this on everybody. And just based on that metadata alone, I could tell, you know, maybe not me, but an actual trained analyst could immediately tell if you're having an affair, if you sought help for depression or anxiety by calling a psychiatrist's office, uh, if you're having financial problems, you're contacting tax consultants and all this shit. So within a few minutes from your metadata, they know far more about your life then the government possibly should know, especially if you have nothing to hide, then you're not doing anything wrong.

Speaker 4:          00:10:59       It's just shocking that it was all going on and no one was speaking out about it until this one dude. And he comes out with it and now he's on the run. He's hiding. I was looking on the, the front of a USA Today and it was in my, uh, hotel and it said like some, you know, 65% of Americans think Edward Snowden should be put on trial.

Speaker 5:          00:11:25       Actually, the American people I think had been pretty good about knowing that they're being bullshitted right now. Like it's something like two thirds want to see a congressional investigation not into stolen, but into these programs. And if they're targeting Americans. And, uh, one, uh, one thing I want to put out here before I forgot about it is we keep the debate is like, well, should we do this to Americans? And it's a given at this point that we are absolutely 100%, no doubt about it doing this to people in Europe. People in Asia are supposed to trading, responding, spying on them. And these are still human beings too. I mean, they're not US citizens, but should ordinary people who have no links to radicalism or terrorism, should they have their personal stuff rifled through by somebody who is, uh, an analyst at the NSA, basically a government employee.

Speaker 5:          00:12:08       These aren't people who have taken years of training and they've lost their ego and some kind of like a razzle ghoul ceremony, like in a dark night, you know, they don't train on the ice and, uh, lose themselves and some greater cause. They're just people who saw a fucking newspaper advertisement and applied for this job at Fort Meade and now they have access to an unbelievable amount of information about ordinary people all over the world. That's crazy. So it's not just metadata. The are absolute emails. There's two theories and I'll share both of them and you can decide which one's true. So we know with 100% certainty that they are looking at metadata of innocent people. It appears to be all phone records within the United States. And if they're doing that here, you can assume that they're pretty much doing it everywhere because that's what the NSA does.

Speaker 5:          00:12:52       They're not even supposed to be doing this stuff on us soil, but uh, are not supposed to be doing it unless they have a specific foreign target within the United States. All of this stuff, the NSA does made sense back during the Cold War. So if you'd have like a Soviet agent come to the u s and you suspect them of doing spy shit, you want to wait in, you wouldn't have a way to tap into their phone calls while they're in the United States. So it made sense to do this kind of stuff back then. It never made sense to turn it in on American citizens. And that's where seeing whistleblowers now come out and say, this is wrong, this is not the way this program was set up, et cetera. And uh, yeah, so the two, the two theories are definitely made a data and then the actual contents of your phone calls and emails according to some people, uh, is being logged and NSA servers, no matter who you are, you could be the most innocent person out there who's never, uh, never even smoked a joint or looked at any kind of Alex Jones website.

Speaker 5:          00:13:47       And you're still having your emails and phone calls logged on a server somewhere and they're not accessed unless they have reason to suspect you of a crime and they get some kind of court approval and then they access all your phone conversations. That's theory one and theory too, is that they're actually not recording everything. They're just recording the recording the metadata. And if you're on their target list, then they're recording all of your phone calls and emails. But if not, they're only looking at the metadata. And what's so scary about theory too, which is, you know, the more conservative theory, it's not as uh, not as frightening as the other theory. What's fucked up about it is that according to William Binney, the other NSA whistleblower, there are several of them. The way that you get targeted is once you're introduced to somebody else's community, you're now added to the target list.

Speaker 5:          00:14:32       So I'll just give you an example. In the past stuff had conversations with journalists who am almost certain or being uh, or on the NSA target list just cause they cover really sensitive stuff. So since I've had conversations with them by email and by phone, I'm now a part of their community and I'm added to the target list, which means that all my phone calls being logged in a server somewhere, the actual content. So if they need to, they can listen to them in the future. And by you talking to me right now, that makes you a part of my community. And now you're on the target list and if you talk to somebody next week, they're on the target list and it just keeps going. And going. And so there are millions of people on this list. The whole world. Yeah. I mean that becomes the whole world.

Speaker 5:          00:15:12       Well you look at the justifications, they're using a completely absurd, they say if your communications are only us communications, we are definitely not intercepting them. But you know, if you have a lot of followers on Twitter, it's a hundred percent certain that you've interacted with Twitter followers who are not living in the United States. If you've ever received an email that's like a spam email, it's almost certain that that did not originate on a US server at originated somewhere in Europe or Russia. Uh, and you know, when you visit websites, most of the shit you look at is not based in the u s so whenever you do those

Speaker 1:          00:15:42       shit, you look at Boston Baba, come on sign, I'm on American websites all day.

Speaker 5:          00:15:49       Pornhub is American from what I understand. So can you like just forward your phone number to like a home phone number and then like direct your text messages through a website that you know, isn't recording or information. Like, is there some kind of hack that you can hack yourself? Well, what tank phone, what's so bad about this from an economic perspective is, uh, there are already companies that are positioning themselves is where us free. You know, your data won't be stored in the U S it's like we're infected now with this out of control, corrupt government and people. And what sucks about that is we're the ones who make this shit happen. Like cloud storage, innovative stuff like Facebook and Google, you know, content companies like, uh, like youtube and stitcher and all this stuff. This is what we're good at as a country and we export all around the world and now we're like tainted goods because you can't trust us anymore. I've government is too crazy just for the same reason that a lot of companies don't want to do business in China because it would mean, you know, like buying off a lot of people and dealing with a lot of bullshit. Now the US is becoming a place where, you know, great people, great innovation, but the government is too volatile and you can't trust it. And that that's terrible because that means that we're not going to be the ones who pull ahead over the next 50 years.

Speaker 1:          00:16:54       It's so fucked up because if you talk to people, uh, that, you know, normal folks in America that will exhibit some sort of patriotism, they have an idea of what America is like everyone's idea of America. This is America's, you know, hey, this is a truly free crunch country where a person is not tied down by their lineage. They can make something out of themselves. A lot of success stories, a nation of free thinking individuals. We have all of these like positive things that we attached to it. But God damn, if we're not governed by a bunch of paranoid fucking Weirdos

Speaker 5:          00:17:27       yeah. And they wrap themselves in the flag. I think most Americans are good people, obviously, or I wouldn't be here. And uh, it's not the people and it's not the companies here. It's the government has gone beyond the bounds that were set up.

Speaker 1:          00:17:41       Isn't that what happens when, like if you have a, a paradigm that you've been operating under and then all of a sudden that paradigm just dissolving under you, like, like rising tide and you know what's happening. So what do you do? You tried to put a bunch of crazy laws in place to try to stop it. He tried to be able to check out and you fucking put the fear of God and everybody check out all their emails. Look at all the Dick Pics, look at all their phone calls. They're making a three o'clock in the morning when they're drunk. Look at everything. Look at everything. I got you bitch. You better keep your fucking mouth shut. We're going to keep running it this way.

Speaker 5:          00:18:13       Well, it's uh, what's crazy is the director of the NSA, Keith Alexander, a General Keith Alexander, uh, he was giving testimony before Congress and I think this was either earlier today or yesterday. And at the end of his testimony, he didn't realize that the mic was still hot next to him. And he leans over to one of his aides and says, I need to buy your boss a freaking beer, talking about the FBI guys who were testifying in support of this program. And so, you know, at the end of the day what he said, that's nothing wrong. Of course, the FBI and the NSA collaborate there. You know, that's what they do. Their intelligence agencies and law enforcement agents or the case, the FBI, you know what I'm saying, or did the same shit. And uh, so nothing, he said there was wrong. These, that's actually shows that he's a human being and it goes out to drink beer every now and then.

Speaker 5:          00:18:56       It isn't this, you know, a computer. Uh, so nothing you said was wrong, but just that single line, uh, that he didn't want the world to hear in the world heard, uh, has been analyzed to death online. It hit the front page of Reddit. People are, you know, in conspiracy land now. And if you think like, you know, this guy, he didn't want that line of conversation to hit the wrong people. What about every single text message you've ever sent? Every single website you've ever sent? It's kind of, it's richly ironic, right? It's showing that this is not a good system. Even if you have nothing to hide, uh, maybe you don't want your future employer to see every porn website you've been to, every medical condition you've looked up and every deleted text message from the, uh, you know, the woman you're seeing, it's just not their fucking place to see that in the first place. And then why extend that power to a government agent who is just somebody who applied for a job and happens to have a clean record? That's all an NSA analyst is. Again, they're not people who have, you know, detached themselves from the ego and they're driven only by love of country. I would hope that's what most of them are there for. But we don't know that people are people. And that's why we have a constitution. That's why we have the bill of rights is to prevent this from happening in the first place.

Speaker 1:          00:20:03       This is very well put and um, I think unfortunately the reality of our times is that things are moving in the direction of a complete elimination of all boundaries between people and information. I just don't know if there's any way to stop it. And when you find out that the people with the, you can't say like the ability to like what, what the government is doing, they have to do and secretly in secrecy because no one is going to allow it. No one is going to say like, yeah, I fully support you listening to every fucking email to stop the occasion. Are you chewing ice? You motherfucker stop the occasional tea. I mean, think about how many terrorism, how many terrorist, how many people die of terrorism as opposed to how many people died just from drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes. Right? The government doesn't try to ever get you to stop doing those things, but way more people die from them than are ever going to probably got die from terrorism.

Speaker 1:          00:20:59       I mean 400,000 people every year die from cigarettes and you never hear the government talking about how cigarettes are the enemy. What they're doing is they're, they're trying to keep people scared and by trying to keep people scared, they can continue to govern things the way they're doing it. And the way. So the way to be able to check out all your email and keep everybody back on their heels is to say, we have to protect you from terrorism. We're trying to stop terrorism and the way to stop terrorism, we just got to check everything. You gotta you gotta look at everybody's Dick Pic.

Speaker 5:          00:21:27       Yeah. You got to look at it. And then if we happen to find out along the way that you're gay, you're gay, and you're going to be, oh, you're going to be running for some office in the future or that you have cancer or that you spoke marijuana and you happen to live in a conservative state and you're a congressman who plans on investigating the NSA, they can just give you a little heads up, you know, maybe think twice before you say anything on that oversight committee. And uh, I'm not saying this stuff is happening, but like my, I guess my whole issue is why wouldn't it happen if they'd been this dishonest about the extent to which they're spying on people and now they're like, oh, we're transparent. Yeah. After a whistle blower goes to Hong Kong at the risk of his life and reveals these documents, then you're transparent and then, then there's a credibility problem.

Speaker 5:          00:22:08       It's the difference between you calling the IRS. I mean like, look, I'm a little bit behind on my taxes difference between that and them being like, what does this account in the Caymans, you know, what is this all about? It's still, it's a huge difference. Same with anything. It's like going to your girlfriend and saying you fucked up about something versus her finding out. And then you have to explain yourself and that's what the government is doing now. And the two arguments they're making or to anyone who's reasonably intelligent or not acceptable, they say, this is nothing new. This is all routine. This is no big deal. Well then why are you treating the sky as if he's blown the cover off something huge. If this is no big deal. Why did Senator Lindsey Graham said that he will go to the ends of the earth to track this guy down? You know, why are they treating him as if he's such a threat to national security? If we all knew that all of our shit was being looked at anyway?

Speaker 1:          00:22:54       Well, we definitely did all know that. Right? There's no doubt about that. But there was some concern about the, the facility that we're building in Utah. I had heard about that online. Uh, you, you had spoken about it. Um, uh, Michael Rupert spoken about it, that they're building a facility that stores everything. It's going to be a massive, gigantic data center. And the idea is, look, if you don't do anything wrong, they never going to look into it. But the reality is who are they and how did they get that position? They're just human beings.

Speaker 5:          00:23:26       The laws change over time. Like just to give you a, a nightmare scenario 2016, let's say we get a president, uh, what's his fucking name? President Santorum or President Rick Perry is somebody like that. And because they feel like this is a good way to gain support from the conservative base, they go on a morality platform, which has happened before in the United States. Look, prohibition, they go on a morality platform. They say, look, the the U s is falling behind shine on the countries. The reason why is that were soft, you know, or a bunch of druggies and a bunch of alcoholics. So from here on out, we're not just going to continue to keep marijuana criminalized. We're going to super criminalize it and just eradicated from the United States. And so what they do in that case, it's, even though you know it wasn't illegal four years ago to send emails to your friends talking about the medical marijuana clinic that you go to in California, even though that's totally fine in 2013 and 2016 it's no longer legal to talk about those things and to promote that ideology and all you have to do is do a keyword search in their database and find everybody who is sympathetic to marijuana reform, it make their lives a little bit more difficult.

Speaker 5:          00:24:28       You know, maybe hit them with audits are trumped up charges or anything.

Speaker 1:          00:24:33       When that happens, you're not living in a representative democracy. You're, you're looking at,

Speaker 5:          00:24:37       you're living in a place for unelected people or people who you know, have been elected in and corrupted or making decisions for you and there's nothing you can do about it and you don't even know the decisions are being made until it impacts you personally.

Speaker 1:          00:24:49       Yeah, and this is really a pattern that has repeated itself over and over again throughout human history. And it was, it's really exactly what the founding fathers of this country we're trying to prevent. When they crafted the constitution, they were trying to protect against this continual cycle of people getting to power and then abusing that power. It just, it happens. It's always happened. It's the way humans do it and slowly but surely they've chipped away at it with things like Nda or the Patriot Act and they do it and they do it while nothing's happening. They're not like they're doing it and why bombs are blowing up over the overhead and we need to declare martial law and figure out what's going on. A lock, everything down. It's not like that at all. They're just recognizing the tide coming in and they're scrambling and they're trying to find all sorts of new ways to get at data, but in the meantime though, their data is being captured.

Speaker 5:          00:25:41       It's funny you said the tide's coming in because one of the best theories I've seen so far and why they're doing all this stuff. I was published in the Guardian newspaper the other day and the theory that this one guy proposed is that the government strongly believes that economic and possibly energy, uh, unrest. So the price of fuel as well as you know, people's wages and their savings, all of that stuff is going to be an upheaval in the near future. And the reason why is climate change. If you think about New York City, if just the tide levels rise by a couple of feet, you're talking about, you know, the New York Stock Exchange flooding out and that market being closed for a couple of weeks at the minimum and you know, total financial chaos, not to mention all the people who lose their lives and the flooding. So you, if you realize how serious climate changes and that half the country, you know, that sort of Fox News view is just a market and pretend like it's bullshit.

Speaker 5:          00:26:31       This is happening. And apparently the government is concerned about the unrest that will come from just one major catastrophe, that people will start to protest the government the, so you didn't do your job, you should have known about this beforehand and there will be just upheaval. So what pisses me off about this is if that's the reason why the government is storing all of our emails is so they can pick out all the influencers within protest groups in the future, if that's what this is all about, it's fucking absolutely disgusting that they're using their considerable resources and technology to, uh, make sure that protests don't take off in the u s instead of using that talent and technology to prevent these things from happening in the first place. You know, let's tackle climate change. Let's figure out how we don't have a drought in the future. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:27:14       But the, but what you're saying is very general. The, you're dealing with a bunch of compartmentalize people. And so if you're attacking their specific thing, the thing with whether it's the IRS or whether it's the NSA, if you're going after their specific department, they're not going to thank, you know what? We need to just put a man on the moon. You know, they're, they're not thinking like that. They're thinking we have to protect our organization. Right. It's toxic because it's corporation thinking. It's corporate thinking with guns.

Speaker 5:          00:27:43       You said, man, on the moon, our grandparents put humans on the moon and now we're just trying to fight. The government's not read our emails. It's like we're moving backwards in time.

Speaker 1:          00:27:52       Well, it's, um, there's, there's a lack of privacy that is just overwhelmingly apparent when you look at the future. If you extrapolate the future, the, the lack of privacy is the thing that people dread the most over the last few years. Whether it's someone hacking into your email or someone you know, spying on your phone calls or there the fact that it now is completely a reality. That was like something that people were really worried about for a long time. As it, as it gets more and more invasive, as technology permeates your life more and more, it's going to, it's going to reach some point where we have neural chips. Well, we have a headpiece that we, where we have something

Speaker 5:          00:28:34       that's not so bad. If it's open to everyone, it will be, you know, the bidding. Right now it's only the government looking at it, so it's a one way mirror.

Speaker 1:          00:28:41       I really believe, I know people give me shit about this and they think it's a very utopian way of looking at the world, but I, I truly believe that this, this new age that we're entering into this age of complete openness is going to force people to be accountable. It's going to change behavior and even the people that govern, they're going to govern differently. It's kind of, they're going to have to, they're going to want to, you're not going to want to feel the repercussions from all these people that you're doing something wrong. You're going to feel bad, you're going to change. It's not a good life to be suppressing and bullying and dominating people and and using dirty tactics like reading their emails to control your political agenda and to contaminate your opponents. It's evil and it's not good for you either. The person who does it, it's shit for you. You're going to get cancer. You're going freak out. You're going to the negative energy that you're putting out there in the world. That's not a free ride. You can't be some global fucking asshole, you know, that's poisoning third world countries for profit. You can't be that guy and sleep like a baby and wake up with a smile. You're, you're a flawed human being.

Speaker 5:          00:29:59       It's unconsciousness. I've thought a lot about this, about why these consultant companies are working with the government to spy on American citizens and they're even building similar systems for Middle Eastern countries where you know, at least here we can tell ourselves that Obama will never use this against us and that there are these posted safeguards in place, which really why would we tell ourselves that though that's what people do. We don't like to think that it could happen here, but, but let me just play this out. The same companies that built that shit over here and maintain it are building similar systems in the Middle East. And those countries are corrupt monarchies that have no qualms about using it to do exactly what I said, to figure out who the protesters are, to pull them out of their homes and torture them until they stopped protesting. And it's, it's appalling to me that American companies are involved in this.

Speaker 5:          00:30:44       And I kept thinking, how is this possible? You know, cause I know some, I know some people who work in the defense field and stuff of that nature, those kinds of companies, and they're like, they're not bad people. And I think what it is is this unconsciousness. You have people who were around that Guy Edward Snowden's age around my age who are making more money than they should be making, you know, $200,000 a year and just these assholes wearing khakis flying all over the world. And they're in a position of privilege, you know, airport lounges, uh, you know, attractive women. They make more than most people that age make and they have access to extraordinary power and they're doing this because they've been told that that's what you're supposed to do after college, you should be successful. You want to make a lot of money, have a nice girlfriend, do these things and so you're just in this little pool, this isolated pool of other people who are doing the same thing as you and so you're like, well my friend Tom, he's making $215,000 a year so I have to do a good job on this NSA project to make sure I'm like two 40 next year and can take my girlfriend is some nice place in the Hamptons for a week and these people are not the ones ruling the world.

Speaker 5:          00:31:46       They're just the pawns for the 65 year old 70 year old dudes who actually run these defense companies and why are they doing this stuff? They have more money than God. They don't need to continue doing the same things over and over again. I think they're doing it because it becomes competitive at that point. They want to get invited to next year's Bilderberg and jerk each other off or whatever it is they do at these things. They want to be in the club. And if you stop a, if you're no longer a part of the process, you kind of fall out of the club. And that's what it's about. It's unconsciousness. People feel like there's no other way. Like that's the way you should live your life is to gain more and more influence until you die. And maybe that's not the right approach.

Speaker 1:          00:32:21       Well, human beings are incredibly malleable, mean we're able to adapt to strange situations and we're, we're able to rise and fall to incredible heights and depths. I mean, we're, we're fucking weird man. We don't, we're not standard. You know, there's not like a normal human, like the way humans, very luck in behavior and personality and capabilities. It's not like anything in the animal kingdom. A tiger is a fucking tiger is a fucking tiger. You know, you could feed one and if you're lucky, associates you with being a good thing because you feed them. But if one day he decides to go Siegfried and Roy on you, that's, that's his choice. Okay. There's nothing you can do about that. Humans are so different. There's, there's so much variability and it's, it's weird. There's so many variables. It's the the, to make a good human is incredibly difficult and until we concentrate on making good people, until we concentrate on the impoverished people in this country, this world even, I mean, until we look at the weakest link of humanity, if we really do look at humanity, we want to pretend we're humane.

Speaker 1:          00:33:22       We really do look at it collectively. The thing you have to do is you've got to stop all these bad spots. If you have a foundation and the foundation is all fucked up with worms and and termites and shit, you've got to cut that out and rebuild it. If you don't have a good foundation, you're fucked. If you look at any society, look at the weakest link. The weakest link is its biggest problem and the weakest link of his country's completely ignored. Poor people like, fuck you. Get your own. Figure it out. Fuck yourself. There's so little money being put into it. You have to pay for school. You know when, when it comes to colleges and always going to pay for it. I mean, maybe I can get a grant if you're lucky. Try getting the grant. Okay, you got to Gregg. Congratulations. Not trying to get an a job once you get out of there. Oh, back to the back to the situation, right.

Speaker 5:          00:34:01       Oh dollars an hour or unemployed.

Speaker 1:          00:34:03       Massive struggle to try to get out of that situation and no resources put to try to solve it. Like social engineering as a culture. Like let's look at our brothers and sisters and say, well how can we help them? How can we make sure that these babies aren't growing and he's incredibly toxic environments? They're going to be damaged human beings that go out to inflict more bullshit on society. All of that can be avoided if you cut it off at the path. All that can be avoided. It sounds so cliche, but with love and understanding, and if you treated it that way and realize that we're not going to fucking be in this thing forever and we now for the first time ever all have access to the right amount of information where we should be able to sort this out. We should all be able to understand like what the fuck is really going on with human behavior, what's really going on with the, the, the way corporations can act as an individual. But yet no one inside the corporation feels anything that the individuals doing that's horrible

Speaker 5:          00:34:58       when everyone wants to fuel and they feel that way to become a whistle blower. And then the media says that there are a trader and you know, a, a narcissist. The Sky has turned down. By the way, the Guy Snowden is turned down every single major TV interview that has been thrown his way, which is pretty much all of them. So if he's a narcissist, why is he turning down all of the press? He's clearly and why would he destroy his life? That makes no sense. Clearly that's bullshit. But that's what happens is when you're in a corporation or an organization, you see that the stuff around you is not functioning the way it should. That person's a whistle blower if they choose to step up. And instead of us being as a society, like Holy Shit, that person did a heroic thing there for sure. Getting a big ass book deal and we're gonna get laid for the rest of their lives because of what they've done for this country. Instead of that being the paradigm where we reward those people, it's like trader, you know

Speaker 1:          00:35:46       later and you want to step back because you don't want to get caught,

Speaker 5:          00:35:49       right. You don't want to be connected to that and uh, they can never get a job again. Like Thomas Drake, the other NSA whistleblower, they're actually several of them. Thomas Drake, his, his life over the past few years sounds like a movie and it probably will be a movie someday soon. He was a senior executive at the NSA or a senior official there and saw what was going on and saw there was deeply unamerican and unconstitutional and became a whistleblower. And they went after him with everything they had charged them under the espionage act. And uh, now he ended up not going to prison. He was very fortunate in that respect, not to go to prison, but now he works at an apple store as an hourly retail, a rep, just that fucking apple store telling people about the new iPhone. And this was a guy who was privy to the government's most sophisticated technological secrets. And now he's telling people how to refresh their mail, maybe likes it. And that's a good gig. That's a relaxing no technology. And I'm saying it's a great Gig, but if you're one of the smartest people in the country, to the point where the NSA recruits you, these are not stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:36:51       So you're saying that he can't get a job anywhere else. Same reason why he's there, but he's blackballed

Speaker 5:          00:36:56       is other intelligent. Other intelligence agencies don't want that person around. When really if you're not doing anything wrong and you're a big company or a big government agency, you should want to recruit people like that to show them off. You know, look, we hired this guy, so we're above board. We're not doing anything illegal, but they don't do that. Those people are kind of fucked for life. Maybe get the fuck this guy. Maybe it wasn't that smart to begin with. It was just whoever hired him was his dumb. Maybe he's a trader,

Speaker 1:          00:37:22       he could be a trader. I look, you know, and I don't mean to demean his accomplishments or what he did or his courage in any way in real life. We're joking around the the re. The reality though is you're absolutely right. Brave man. Yeah, you're absolutely right. And you're absolutely right that it's, it's, it's, it's real travesty and it's, it's sad that we all look at America as like one thing, but if you see at the root of it, like the people that are running it, what they, the disdain that they have for the privacy of the American people, it's the rights. Horrendous rights are the rights and they want to chip away at them. And even a guy like Obama, which is, I was, man, when Obama won, I was so fucking happy when he first became president. I was like, oh my God. Like we really have like broken through the cloud.

Speaker 5:          00:38:10       I was, I was in union square at the time with my girlfriend in New York and there was like mist in the air. I'm not making this up. There was actually mist in the air. There's just a sea of people like cheering him on with this big TV screen. And I voted for him in 2008. And I was definitely a part of that. You know, the Koolaide drinking club of hope and change. And yes, we can, you know, he said yes, we can. It doesn't mean that he actually would. And uh, you know, like I bought it, I bought into it completely. And that's part of the reason why I've becomes such a critic is covering these stories over the past year and a half. You see that his great speeches have almost no correlation to what he is actually doing. After the TV turns off. And he goes back to running his administration and that's what, that's what really like, uh, it makes my blood boil.

Speaker 5:          00:38:51       Like you just were talking about Obama before my phone dies. I really want to read, this is from MSN news. It's not from like some right wing site, like a Glenn Beck or something like that. So he's planning a trip to Africa and they're saying it might be the most expensive presidential trip ever. This is a quote from MSN news. The trip, which begins June 26th could cost 60 million to $100 million and could be one of the most expensive presidential trips in United States history. One unnamed source told The Washington Post the higher estimate cost of this month's trip is partially due to elaborate security provisions. Uh, let me just read the actual stats. Resources will reportedly include hundreds of us secret service agents and a Navy aircraft carrier with a fully staffed medical trauma center. Military cargo planes will transport 56 support, vital support vehicles including 14 limousines and three trucks loaded with sheets of bulletproof glass to cover the windows of the hotels were the first family will stay.

Speaker 5:          00:39:52       And my question is, is that a reasonable use of money? 14 limousines. Why can't we just have two or three and this guy's a president of a constitutional republic or is he the emperor of some high tech, a dystopian society that spies on the whole world and deploys drones to countries that we don't like to kill people on the basis of this secret information we're obtaining through their email and you start to wonder like we've strayed pretty far from the the farmers and the 13 colonies who were like, we need to, you know, a form of government that is going to resist future, you know, power grabs. We're in a totally different world from what they envisioned. Yeah. We're like super techno gangster. That's really what it is.

Speaker 1:          00:40:33       Vertech techno gangster society that's controlling resources everywhere. We're like Rome times a million.

Speaker 5:          00:40:40       Yeah. I think if you were to beam Julius Caesar to the present day, who'd be like, God Damn Obama. Yeah, he, he would, he would be impressed. It would take about an afternoon or two to bring them up to speed on the internet, podcasts, satellites. Once you do that though, they're exactly the same. I guess I'm being kind of harsh enough. I don't, but I think ideologically they're exactly the same. Kind of, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:59       Well they're not the.live in the same time. If they were living in the same time, they'd have probably similar behavior. Yeah. That's the thing that people have to realize is that there's so many steps removed from the person in charge of the country or the person in charge of the army, even in the brutalization that happens on the ground, you know, and Obama is very, very far removed from the brutalization that happens. In fact, the weird new kind of brutalization that happens where everyone's removed except the people that get hit. That's what's so strange about drones. The idea that someone could be no where near where this is happening and do something that causes someone to stop living and that it happens on a regular basis. Yeah. It's the ultimate detachment from reality. I mean, and it's, it's an excellent technological solution as far as like saving troops and all that stuff. If you looked at it that way, if you want it to be pragmatic on the side of Americans, but it's not that effective, it kills a lot of people that it's not supposed to kill. It kills a lot of kids. It's killed many kids and it's, it's creepy. Something creepy about it.

Speaker 5:          00:41:59       Yeah. It's uh, it's too much disconnection between people you're killing and it's too easy. It's too easy to do it to Americans where you don't even have to go to trial. Speaking of too easy, uh, this'll freak freak everybody out a little bit, but oh Geez. I'm so the, the list, we've already broken the precedent of targeting and killing American citizens without a trial using drones for us citizens have been killed that way, that we know of. And granted the one guy was an asshole and probably deserved it. But the other three, we don't really know. The one guy was the guy who turned out tell about some Muslim propagandist. If you're actually proper guy propagandizing people and you know, inciting them to violence, then you're an asshole and you really kind of get what you deserve. But we've now created that slippery slope and I give it a slippery slope.

Speaker 5:          00:42:43       We've gone down the slope now we've actually killed American citizens with drones. So in the future court cases, we'll look back to that. That's the precedent that we'd done it. You know, President Obama, the thoughtful liberal constitutional law scholar thinks that it's okay. So it's certainly okay for a president, Rick Perry to do that. And he keeps saying that cause that's the scariest outcomes saying that. I think he just recently, uh, I think either in Texas or in Florida, they're trying to make it a felony to even flown to Florida two pipes if you get caught twice. So that's why I keep saying that cause that's a real possibilities. You get somebody like that in the Oval Office and they have all these toys and they use it in the worst way as possible. And all you'll hear about it is, you know, Erin Burnett on CNN saying some, some radical terrorists were killed last night and they happen to be in the United States.

Speaker 5:          00:43:34       And most Americans will go, well, good. I want to be safe. I don't want those people here anyways. And you don't look into the fact that, well, what did they actually done? They did nothing. They were just on the wrong list and they planned on attending some protest and now they're vaporized. I'm not saying that's going to happen tomorrow, but I'm saying we've 100% laid the legal groundwork for that to happen. That's essentially Kent State, 2013 style. Right. So essentially what the or Ruby Ridge or any of that stuff? Well, yeah, well, Ken state especially, I don't know what really happened on Ruby Ridge. I don't know, uh, how Kooky that dude was when they were shooting at people. Yeah. Do you know? No, I, I don't know. I wasn't there obviously. So Kent State, it was just students. Just Moa.

Speaker 1:          00:44:13       Yes. I mean the, the whole us versus them. Shit, I think is way harder to pull off today though because the cops realize that they're not the Bilderberg group. They're not, they're not chilling with Obama, you know, eating caviar on a nuclear submarine,

Speaker 5:          00:44:28       right? Yeah. They're not spending $100 million. Their vacation and their kids are not going to these elite schools.

Speaker 1:          00:44:34       Well, it's not only that they, they have to know at this point in time that they are the, exactly, the cops are exactly the same as the people that are arresting. Okay. They're just regular citizens. No. A cop is just like you. He just has a different job in a different loyalty and then he becomes a part of a team and then he has loyalty to that team. They cover up for each other and then you might never dirty boss. He might have a boss. It's good, but it's like, that's exactly what it becomes is it becomes a person, just a person who becomes a part of a community and then assimilate. And when the community's rotten, it's very difficult to, to be clean. It's very difficult. Look at, I mean we all assumed that Obama was this like super awesome guy and we all assumed that he was going to go in there and switch things up. Let's assume that he actually was, look, let's assume that he actually was who he seemed to be his entire life up until he became president. That just goes to show you how rotten the community that he got. Yeah. Inserted into, he got inserted into some shit. It's just completely fucked

Speaker 5:          00:45:33       and it's not too late for him to do the right thing. He's a second term president. Well, if he were to go through with just, you know, I don't think you're on a 10% of the stuff he promised in the campaign trail. You start to reign in these things that he was supposed to have done. Yeah. Then it's not too late to change things, but I, I'm not saying that's gonna happen. I think he is already, he has shown us his cards and whatever remaining shred of respect I had for the guy. I lost it after watching that press conference on June 7th June 7th or eighth where he lied to the American people. He said, we're not listening to your phone calls. That's not what this program is about. A, that's, that's lawyer speak. Cause the metadata tells you so much about people. And B, it appears that you actually are listening to phone calls and a lot of cases.

Speaker 5:          00:46:17       So either you don't know what your own administration is doing, which is possible, in which case you need to fucking fire those people and have an independent investigation and to why they're doing something against your wishes. Or you do know about this and it's a total one 80 from everything you said on the campaign trail. Like people always say to me, they're like, well, Bush started these programs. I don't see why you're giving Obama such a hard time. And I go, that's right. But Obama didn't say, I'm going to be, you know, aggressively continuing the same path as Bush. Young people got out to vote because he said enough. You know, American needs a clean slate. We're not doing this post nine 11 craziness anymore. We're going to have the rule of law, I'm a constitutional law scholar, all that stuff. And then we find out that secretly the program has actually been expanding and bringing all these new companies on board to harvest our data.

Speaker 5:          00:47:03       And I think that's when I lost that, that final shred of respect cause I'd already been covering like Nda and the growth, the Tsa and all these things that I disagree with. And then you're like, wait a second, why are you doing this? You know, now there's no shadow of a doubt. Like you either don't know what you're on government is doing, in which case you're bad at your job or you do know and you're being dishonest with Americans. How much power do you think he has? He's the most powerful person in the world. Do you think that's real? I think that's real. Or else why? Why would it matter much who we choose?

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       I think he's the so, but does it, I mean it does, doesn't it get boiled down? First of all, the two parties, which is bullshit. Second of all to, to people that are absolutely supported by gigantic corporations. It's not like there's any rogue independence that sneak through. He went, he went to war with Libya basically unilaterally, right? I mean you're, you're an influential guy. You can't go on Twitter and decided to start a war with Libya. This guy, he, you keep saying he because we don't, but this is where my dispute it. Am I not be Obama who we don't, I don't know. I don't necessarily not leave that. They would allow a new person to come in every four years and just run shit. And that's possible also because if the NSA is doing with what we now know they're doing, what if they're like, look, we know you have all these plans to do a, B, and c for the country, but we have these really kind of embarrassing phone calls between you and whoever.

Speaker 4:          00:48:24       His doesn't even have to do that. Does anyone have anything but enough to compromise him and or just maybe just seduce them with that level of power? Have you ever tried to do anything where you have to involve a bunch of people that also get to make decisions? Yeah, it becomes a Dick Swing and contrast that to but trying to get to hang around with a rubber band more often. I feel you definitely do. I benefit. You definitely wear a condom. The um, like it's, it's, it's real easy to get caught up in the, you know, the, the whole, the hustle of how you're living and to, to not have, uh, the, the, the ability to step back and take a deep breath and look at the whole thing collectively and what Obama and all these other guys are doing is just playing into the direction that it's been going and been going forever, but only going right now at least on the level that they can achieve the, it has to be someone at the highest levels of government that can store all the data of all the phone calls all over the world.

Speaker 4:          00:49:25       But that's just now. I feel like what they can do now by listening to every phone call and reading every text you're going to be able to do in a hundred years from now, five years from now, whatever it is, 10 years from now. I don't think there's any room in this world for secrets, but what about it gets a left over thing that we cherish? The financial aspect of being able to spy on people around the world. Well, in here it gets even deeper. What about the financial aspect of resources being broken down to a digital thing? Look at what money used to be. Money was a gold standard. It was set on goal. There was $100 worth of gold or something that represented a hundred dollars with a goal. It doesn't mean shit anymore. It means ones and Zeros that are written down on paper somewhere or on a computer. That's it. That's what it means is based entirely on confidence. You know, and that's obviously a gross simplification of the financial system, but that's just because that's all I can do. I don't really understand how it actually works. It is a total confidence game from what I understand. But the bottom line is it, it doesn't represent

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       anything anymore. It's becoming, computers can become in ones and Zeros. Well, when we get to that point, which is fucking calming, okay, we want to pretend that we, everyone hates the idea of socialism. Everyone hates the idea of communism, me included. You know why? Because people are fucking shady and they don't do their part. And it would be great if we all made the exact same amount of money if we're all worked hard. But that's not where people's motivation come from. People's motivations come from you work, you achieve something, and then you feel how good that feels. Then you want to continue doing that. But if you give someone something really easily, they become spoiled and we can lazy. That's the problem with, that's a problem with rich kids. That's the problem with celebrities.

Speaker 5:          00:51:07       Well, that's how we're programmed. Our biology, I forget where I heard this, but, uh, our whole evolutionary process is about picking the, uh, the easiest lane and staying in that lane course. Once we find something that works for us. You keep doing it until it's been totally exploited and no longer works for you. And then you move onto the next thing.

Speaker 1:          00:51:24       And for, from a survival standpoint, I do, I'm thinking about what it used to be like to be a human

Speaker 5:          00:51:29       great. When we're all, you know, hunter gatherer is not so great when there's 7 billion of us and all of our decisions are so interconnected that me deciding to be a a, you know, a selfish asshole actually does impact other people. Whereas a hundred thousand years ago I could probably plug as many apples from the trees I wanted. It would have no impact.

Speaker 1:          00:51:49       Yeah, it's, it's definitely getting stranger and stranger. And we're also eliminating by use of technology. We're eliminating a lot of work. There's a lot of things that you don't have to do physically that are done for you acquiring food. Your water comes at the turn of a nozzle, you know, your heat is just a button away.

Speaker 5:          00:52:09       I'll go, I'll go even further than that on you. Uh, the number of you, the number of things that we need money to acquire is actually decreasing every year. So I think a lot of people in this kind of like post recession America feel like they don't have as much as they should have, which is 100% justified. People got fucked. But uh, the fact of the matter is to go on Youtube, on your iPad and instantly view the best cooking instructional videos in the world or the best yoga videos, any topic you want to about the, probably the best brain surgery videos, all those topics are free. Whereas 10 or 15 years ago it would cost you thousands of dollars for an encyclopedia Britannica subscription and that would only contain a fraction of the information on Youtube, the best podcasts in the world, like years of free people are accessing them, paying nothing for this content that to get it. And you know, 15 years ago, this kind of content would probably be a premium cable channel and you'd pay 15 or $20 a month for it. So all these things are just becoming free. That's the whole Internet business model and it's going to get to the point where you just don't need to pay for most of the things in your life. So college will fade away. You'll just self-educate online and meet up once a week with other likeminded people. How we get lid, how you get laid.

Speaker 1:          00:53:20       It's very hard to get laid when you're 18 and 19. You got to be holed up in a house with people and start dorm rooms. Yeah, he got to get people confused. Including yourself. Yeah, I think you're right. I think you're absolutely right and I think, um, we are, we are entering into a new era and it's a new era of convergence and this new era, what the government can do now with this NSA shit, we're all going to be able to do to each other and we have to realize that that is coming. God dammit, you're not going to have any secrets from me and I'm not going to have any secrets from you. And ultimately I think it is a beautiful thing. It sounds fucked up, but I think it's a beautiful,

Speaker 3:          00:53:58       that's called radical. I think it's called radical transparency of this dude David Brin. I had him on my show and he wrote the post man, which is that book that Kevin Costner turned into a movie, which was awesome. I thought it was good. A lot of people didn't like it was horrible. I thought it was cool. Oh my god, it was apocalyptic. Really. It was so bad. It was great. It's like waterworld on waterworld on the land. Yeah, I liked it. Well, you must have had a really good experience when you watch it, watch it with a really pretty girl who was smelled good. Two fingers deep. Easy man. Easy. We're talking about love over here. Yeah, so this Guy Brin talks about radical transparency, which is eventually everything will be known by everyone like this. That's what I think it means and that's, that's, that's real man. You're talking about. I feel that. I feel that when I get high, I do. Sometimes when I get high, it sounds so stupid, but when I get really stupid high and I'm just alone thinking, that's what I think of. I think of the, I feel like we are just a few months away. It seems like,

Speaker 1:          00:54:58       I know maybe it's a years, but I feel like we are just a few months away from everybody hitting some new level of understanding. Yeah. And each

Speaker 3:          00:55:07       other. Have you noticed that everything is speeding up and I feel like the, even the rate, why don't you get up Brian? You panic. The rate of, uh, the rate of these disclosures about what the government is doing now. It's like everyday there's a new braking leak. It's not like it used to be where there's, you know, every now and then some big story every day there's something huge in the news. Look at Turkey where you have a young tech savvy population getting sick of this guy who is trying to clamp down, you know, he's saying, all right, we've got to ban alcohol and we have to a limit and get rid of public affection in public places. No more holding hands or kissing. And the young people who, who spent their whole life on the internet, it's like, fuck this dude, let's all go out and protest.

Speaker 3:          00:55:49       And that's what you're seeing in Turkey right now. It's insane. Yeah. It's uh, it's not just Turkey. Do you see Brazil? Yeah. Brazil in Sao Paulo. Brazil is taking the Brazilian photos. Look at those photos. Look up there, Jesus, man. And why can't we get even get 20 people out to an NDA protest in front of us Federal Court House Week and we're soft. We're like those people that we were talking about, we're like, we're like the spoiled kids, the kids in the Khakis and where the people that didn't earn this, we're not the same people that fought in World War II. Okay. It's a different group group of humans. They, they, those were

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       gritty survivors that just dug their fucking heels in and got shit done. And they were scared. They had just gotten off of the depression. They just gotten off of people waiting in soup lines and people just got shit done. And there was a lot of bad to that too though, man. That, that sort of like desperado society creates a lot of assholes, you know, creates a lot of mean motherfuckers that do whatever they gotta do to get by. I don't think that's necessarily necessary either.

Speaker 5:          00:56:50       There was a guy sitting next to me earlier today at this restaurant bar. I was at getting lunch and he asked to see like a menu and he asked for the price of like a sprite or coke. He was for a sprite. I think I gave him the price and you're like, side. He's like, and then he was asking if there's anything cheaper on the menu. He was like, is there anything else? Is it, uh, and I was thinking if you're, if you're in that kind of place, you should try to find a job and like, ha ha, you know, at least $20 stored up before you walk into a restaurant to get lunch. And I feel like there are a lot of people who just are not putting in a full effort.

Speaker 1:          00:57:23       Well, there's that and there's also that the amount of jobs available today are shockingly low and they're not, they're not good jobs. Our time bullshit. But I think that, and this is very easy for me to say, obviously I recognize this a hundred percent so I apologize before I even say it, but I think that with desperation comes innovation. And I think when you're in a situation where you don't know what the fuck to do, your mind will scramble and you will try to figure out a better way to live your life. Whether it's start your own business, whether it's, you know, do something innovative, do something, come up with an idea. But through desperation, many incredible ideas have been started. And so many great people have stories where they talk about rock bottom. They were fucking eating ketchup sandwiches in their shitty one bedroom apartment and then they went fucking crazy and created a business.

Speaker 1:          00:58:13       Whatever it is that takes you to figure out how to find your place in the world. Understand this, it's difficult. It's going to be puzzling along the way. You gonna to not know whether you go left or right, whether you should sacrifice your morals for performance or for success. There's going to be moments where you, you don't know what to do and what not to do, but you can get through it. Other people have, other people have been poor and then not been poor anymore. Other people been miserable and then figured out a way to be happy. Other people have been lonely and figured out a way to be loved and to be worth being loved, you know, which is like step one. It's possible, but it's not fucking easy. And the government's not helping. That's the problem. We don't have any real leaders. Well we have as a bunch of people that decide what we can't do. Also

Speaker 5:          00:59:02       venting innovation because you talked about that desperation, how it breeds people that come with the right solution that's actually happening. And you look at all the innovation in terms of people are like, this Federal Reserve stuff is bullshit. Doesn't make sense anymore for us to do things in this way. So you have bitcoin, uh, is created a few years ago and other digital currencies and the government instead of stepping back, which is what the Economist magazine, uh, and an editorial said that the government should do is just leave this alone, let it grow for a little while. This could be the next, uh, you know, in the same way that American made a lot of money off the Internet in the 90s, digital currency could be the next boom or at least one of them. And instead of allowing this thing to grow and see what comes out of it, they're already cracking down big time.

Speaker 4:          00:59:44       Now what did they cracking down on and is there any justification for that cracking down? Like is it, they're completely unregulated. So is it open for the scammers?

Speaker 5:          00:59:53       There's so many laws on the books in terms of financial stuff that if you're not one of the big three banks, they can throw anything at you until you run out of money. So in the bit coin example, they want after homeland security, which this is not a terrorist thing. So I'm not really sure why it's there. You know, concern anyway. But a bunch of nerds trading digital currency is not a threat to the United States. And Homeland Security froze the account. That was one of the big exchanges accounts in the United States, their wells Fargo account, they froze it, which is like just freezing part of that network to get money in and out of bitcoin. So bitcoin is still fine because there are other providers who don't have as much of a US footprint, but the fact that they're even doing that shit means that they are concerned about it.

Speaker 5:          01:00:34       And instead they should be doing the opposite. She'd be like, we're going to give grants, government grants to startups that are exploring digital currency cause this could be the future of the world. And I'd rather see America be the ones to create it instead of it being created in Europe as the cases with bitcoin being created in Japan, uh, we're losing out on this one. We were losing out with stem cells where, you know, under Bush we got all this retarded stuff about not exploring stem cells. And so other countries just, we're like, we'll do it. And now if you're a wealthy American and you want to get some kind of stem cell operation, from what I understand that you have to fly to one of these other countries.

Speaker 4:          01:01:09       Germany. Yeah. Germany. Okay. Cause we don't have a wife just got back from Germany. He's telling me how awesome this Koby Bryant went there and then

Speaker 5:          01:01:15       money that the u s is losing out on us jobs. You know, it's fucked up just because our government is acting in this regressive way instead of

Speaker 4:          01:01:24       what we're supposed to be about, which is entrepreneurship. And uh, that's where the big, the big thing becomes like what we're supposed to be about. Hey, be careful. Don't spill it on your generic laptop. That's not an apple. What are you talking about? This is an apple. It's a TV show that we duct taped it. Duct tape brand what's called Greeking cause you make it so that it's indecipherable. Is that because uh, apple will want money or maybe the other way around. Like Sony won't want to give us money. Right. Shows with the TV shows. I loop my brother. Yeah. For the, the TV show. I have to do that. You, Oh, I'll ask you afterwards. Official Shit. I almost forgot we were on TV or on the internet or something. Whenever we are. Um, all this stuff that you, you say like, I know that you're not like a cynical person, which is like really hard for people to believe. If you listen to all the things you say. I'm super optimistic. Yeah. Isn't that crazy?

Speaker 5:          01:02:16       I wrote an ebook about, uh, how our is like actually a really positive one and even this stuff that I talk about now, they're just road bumps on the way to what is going to be complete. I think probably complete abundance.

Speaker 1:          01:02:28       We had to get through Nixon to get to Clinton. Right? I think Clinton was a high point for this country. I really do. You know, for theirs there was certainly a lot of fuckery going on during the Clinton administration and there was some, you know, it's not to say that people didn't die or there, there weren't operations that went on that I'm sure you were, I wouldn't have approved of. But other than that, it was a time of prosperity. And it seemed like a time where everything seemed like it was going to be okay. And something happened during the Bush administration where everything went dark and it didn't feel like it was going to be okay at all. And my perception of America and the world itself changed radically from the 1990s to the the two thousands it was a totally different world when in the 1990s the biggest dilemma was that they wanted to impeach Clinton because he got hit

Speaker 5:          01:03:16       right. It was hilarious. And there were articles in Time magazine about how people have too much money. We're creating too many.com millionaires. What do we do with this is amazing. And that was our problem is that, you know, real estate prices in the valley are too high. What are we going to do as a country?

Speaker 1:          01:03:29       And that people were buying a house and then selling it six months later for twice what they bought it for. It was just, it was Cuckoo, you know, and Vladimir Putin, I remember this quote that he said, he said, uh, I don't understand the American economy. They seem to just buy and sell each other's houses.

Speaker 5:          01:03:46       I mean it's true for what? A shitty accent. That was nice. We're not calling me out. I saw this on reddit and Soviet Russia, internet browsers. You or no, it was in Soviet America cause they're making fun of the NSA program. Oh that's funny. Yeah

Speaker 1:          01:03:58       and funnier because it's so true. It is what it is. We become exactly what we thought they were doing it spying on all their citizens, trying to prevent the scent because they lived in a shit hole country and they didn't want freedom or they didn't want them to get freedom. That's what we always felt about Russia. That was always our jab about Russia.

Speaker 5:          01:04:15       Fox. You seen the Steve Wasniak video? No, you guys got to pull that up. What is it? Pull it up. He was in an airport and the Spanish language reporters came up to him for their blog or whatever, and they were asking about the NSA program. And I think about just like the future of America. And he talks about, I don't want to quote him exactly, but he talks about how America has kind of lost its way and how we're becoming more like Soviet Russia. And for him to say that because he's a super positive, like sweet dude, cofounder of Apple, insanely rich, but still so down to earth that he'll talk to anybody. That's just the video. Right. And that's the video,

Speaker 6:          01:04:50       like that kind of gray or there I think, I think I like all the visuals work. Yup. Yeah, he's talking about a phone first. It gets into party apps and things like that. So really great to do other countries when they got cruiser in a war, they culture, but we Americans did portrait, we're good food and all the and everything. And I was so proud of my country, you know? And now I find out it's just the opposite, you know? And I just wished all these things I talked about the constitution that made us so good as people. They're kind of nothing. They all dissolve with the Patriot Act, you know, and there's just laws, laws that say we can just sort of secretly call anything terrorism and do anything but walk it out, all these rights courts to get in and take care. I'm doing the wrong things, not even free open court anymore.

Speaker 6:          01:05:47       And he read the Constitution. I don't know all this stuff. So clear what the constitution says. Extremely clear in the bill of rights. One thing after another, after another that just that overturned and that's what it came down. He just goes out. Has anyone rounded up and killed, keep the prison. When I was brought up, we were taught that communist Russia was the, the ones that were going to kill us and Bob, mark country and all this and communist Russia was so bad because they followed their people that they swooped on them. So they, uh, they, they arrested them, they put them in secret prisons, they disappeared them. These kinds of things were part of Russia.

Speaker 5:          01:06:25       Yeah. Kind of breaks your heart, right? Cause this is the guy who made it in America based on what we believe in. And now he's in an airport, he's middle aged and he's seeing that this revolution that he was a part of the technology revolution is being used against people instead of being used to help people.

Speaker 1:          01:06:43       We have a real problem with the leadership of this world. And when I say this world that I don't mean in any sort of new world order sense. I mean leadership across the board, every single country, everywhere you go, every single leader of every single nation, we don't have a leadership that fits in with the psychedelic nature of 2013 and when I say psychedelic nature, I don't even mean drugs. I mean the idea behind psychedelics, when someone talks about having a psychedelic experience and oh my God, it was like a psychedelic trip. What they mean besides the, uh, the hallucination aspect is that this trip has transcended them, has moved them into this new place, has made them step back and look at it. It could be a near death experience. It could be the loss of a friend. It could be a pet dying, it could be a new, you're getting fired and getting a new job.

Speaker 1:          01:07:42       There's many things in life you could see a starlit night and it's a psychedelic experience that that is where we're going. Where we're going is newer booms, newer woes, newer connections, new understandings, newer uncoverings of hidden truths and and, and we're, we're getting closer and closer to each other and what the government is doing is the exact opposite of that. What they're trying to do is control, get people scared. Control resources dictate their rules on as many people as possible. Make it so they can't be prosecuted for the same thing they actually prosecute people for but never be called hypocritical control. All the resources control what they're doing is non psychedelic with they're doing is what the ego does when it's desperate, when it's sad, when you're trying to cover up for a lie, when you're trying to, you're trying to attend, you're something, you're not dealing with mortality.

Speaker 1:          01:08:42       You know, if you think you need complete control over other people, that's some kind of weird foil to get around. The fact that you're gonna be dead in 30 years. Our society needs to be psychedelic. And I don't say that in the way that a lot of people think. A lot of people think when you say something should be psychedelic like a little bit, you just want to escape reality. Fucking hippie. That's not what I mean. I went, I mean embrace reality, embrace reality in its broadest sense possible. And it's brought a sense possible. We are all exactly the same. And that me, I don't mean that in any hippie sort of a way. I mean that we are temporary beings on this strange course that no one understands and we all have a certain amount of years to recognize that we're on this thing and then this thing's going to end and W it's going to end badly.

Speaker 1:          01:09:29       The body's gonna stop working. There was a sales will reproduce incorrectly. You're going to cheat. Your stature changed your, your health fades, your energy wanes. Intellect goes away. It goes away the child. And then you die. So during that time we have to figure out what is this, what is this and what are we trying to do here? And if what you're trying to do is control resources and down AP people and make as much money as possible, you are just as sad as some kid is born in Ethiopia where there's no food. You're just as sad as someone who is on an island that doesn't have any books. It's all a mis. It's all a mess. And the Psychedelic Society of 2013 that transcendent experience of the Internet, the ability to communicate with each other from long distances instantaneously. That's very psychedelic

Speaker 5:          01:10:20       interview with one of the engineers at Google who a overseas youtube and just the process of a youtube video uploading and then propagating on all their cache servers is a, it's kind of psychedelic in the sense that within seconds of your video being uploaded less than that, like immediately, it's on servers all over the planet because when you, uh, when you go to a youtube video, it's serving you the video from a server that's relatively close to you. And maybe one in California or something. Uh, somebody in South America is getting a local version of their youtube video and then all the data on the hits from each of those local servers is coming together. And that's the youtube view counter how many hits the video has. So it's actually coming from all these different data centers. There's not one number, it's a bunch of numbers that are being, uh, you know, put together. And just the way he explained it as like, this is fucking insane. You know, like that somebody in their, in their basement like, uh, uh, you know, the big famous video bloggers out there can put up their video and within seconds it's literally all over the world. And if that idea has any kind of value, it propagates within hours like that. Edward Snowden video, uh, was on the homepage of youtube because so many people found it to be significant rose right to the top.

Speaker 4:          01:11:32       I think we are going to have to accept a new paradigm, including the government and the government's trying to stave off that paradigm by creating a bunch of rules. And by taking away people's rights, but they're not going to be able to,

Speaker 5:          01:11:43       by having so many rules that you can selectively enforce it. Yeah. Like I'm sure this stuff they're using against Bitcoin, they're not using against

Speaker 4:          01:11:50       Bank of America or Citibank. Yeah. Well the, the selective enforcement aspect of it is, it's, it's funny because what they're trying to do as I can trying to control judgment, they're kind of trying to control the, the, the will of the people that trying to control, you know, the popular opinion they're trying to, they're trying to control human beings as a resource because all the power comes through the human beings. It all flows from the money, from the taxes, from the votes, from the whatever that you get into a position of power and you're the top of that pyramid. Then you can enforce regulations and rules and change things and you could do things that people never want. Like the NDA when you, all of a sudden you have indefinite detention and people don't even get lawyers and you're like, what? The Russian doesn't even do that. I think, uh, one of my do they, they might, I don't know enough about Russia. They probably would do that. I just know that our t is filled with nice people. They are very nice. Isn't that weird? It's like you would think Russia today would be like the shittiest bunch of assholes and, but he could do, they suck. They're all severe.

Speaker 5:          01:12:50       Super Nice. Uh, yeah. I forgot what I was gonna say. Let's think about Russia today, but, uh, it, uh, where are we talking about here? Um, we were talking about the monarch. Oh yeah. I know that. But um, it'll come to me. I had the specific idea about something. Oh, okay. It's all this Jamison. It's kind of,

Speaker 4:          01:13:08       yeah. Was going to my brand whiskey is not good for the dome. The government lacks it. Don't they tried to take that away. Then there'll be the real riots of me. That's what it really, we really need to take away liquor, liquor and cigarettes. Make it all illegal. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:13:22       Hey, hey, calm down. Oh, I'm saying I remember what, I have a real revolution. I remember I was going to say, sorry about that. Uh, I have this kind of science fiction dystopian view that when the NDA was signed and you know, I was vocal about this nonstop, when that was signed, that was one of these like branches or forks in history where we should have all come out. We should have all came out and protested and people who had positions of power, you know, TV anchors and senators who are not compromised by their own parties should have said, this is fucking bullshit. Since when can you PR in prison, American citizens without a trial on the basis of suspicion alone. That's fundamentally UNAMERICAN it, it makes North Korea look like on the same level as us to do that shit. Why would we allow that?

Speaker 5:          01:14:05       This needs to be immediately fixed. You know, like next week we need an amendment to fix whatever the you did on New Year's Eve. But instead life just kind of went on as normal and it was like a twilight zone episode. You know, I noticed this group of activists and journalists have raised money and they went to New York to fight this shit in federal court and they could barely afford the legal and the travel costs and they're fighting the most powerful government on earth in court, which can keep throwing money at this forever. And that's when I started to lose faith in the system. Cause I'm like, well why are they doing this? You know, Obama had the signing statement saying that he, he signed it into law, but he doesn't like this provision. He doesn't trust that provision. Well then why do you keep fighting for that right in court. If you don't want that and you signed it away and you're signing statement, then why do you keep fighting for it in federal court? And at that point I was like, this is, this is fucked.

Speaker 4:          01:14:55       I think it's again, what we keep saying. Why do you, why does he, why do you, I don't, I don't think it's a you. I don't think it's a, Hey, well then I don't think anybody, but we have to. Anybody gets any of the real power him somewhere. I mean, we certainly do. If you go to a wall, it's like a corporation type blame.

Speaker 5:          01:15:09       Well that's valid though. If you go to a Walmart and you slip on the floor because the floor is dirty and wet, you write a letter to the CEO, even though he wasn't personally there to mop that floor. And the same way Obama is the figurehead for this federal government and its current form. So if we can't place the blame there, if we can't petition him to make things better, who can we petition?

Speaker 4:          01:15:29       Well, that's a good question, but I think that it's in, and it's impossible at this point in the game to control the whole thing. There's no, there's no way. There's no way he could have his fingers in every hole in the dike. There's just too much going on. That's not what I'm at right after I said it. I'm like, fuck. Um, there's, there's, there's no way. And I think the idea that he's responsible for everything the government does, it's preposterous, right? Because there's no way you could be. There's no way you could. There's no way you could have a handle on all that shit. There's no way. There's too many things going on. You've got the FBI, the NSA, the DEA, the FBI, the Coast Guard, the air force, the army, the marines, the navy seals, the green berets come on the rangers. You, you, you don't know what the fuck everybody's doing. You can know what the fuck everybody's doing. It's ridiculous. The idea that we have an Obama in the first place, that we have a president, that we have one dude. This is the Alpha male chimpanzee bullshit.

Speaker 5:          01:16:29       We have a human being that we spend hundreds of millions of dollars of our collective taxpayer money to fly that person somewhere else with 14 limousines and bulletproof glass everywhere. It's like a, some kind of fetishization of a personality. You know, it's one thing to have celebrities because at the end of the day, at the end of the day, celebrities are chosen by us. You know? That's what it comes down to is we choose who we want to focus and unhealthy amount of attention on like the Kardashians. Collectively we choose that. But how many people are actively choosing to pay for somebody like Obama or by the way, President Bush took expensive vacations also. Uh, who exactly decided that this kind of imperial we have now where your vesting so much power in that one person and yet like you said, this makes a lot of sense. That person doesn't have all that much influence to actually change course. So then why are we treating them like they're a god? Because it's a figurehead. It's a

Speaker 1:          01:17:24       someone that you, you have with the head of your organization. We still as chimpanzees, you know, or as the descendants or the ancestors or whatever the fuck we are, the, the, the new breed of how fucking ape, how do we get past the chimpanzees and to that thing? I think we needed mushrooms. I really do. It sounds like, you know, it sounds like hippie nonsense, but I really think just logically, if it's not mushrooms, we need something that brings us all together. It might be ecstasy. One of my most profound psychedelic experiences I ever had was on ecstasy. And I only did it once because the, uh, the rebound of it was way too strong the next day. I can't, I can't refer a crash the next day. It was horrible. It was horrible. And I don't know if it's just me or if it was mixed with something or whatever it was.

Speaker 5:          01:18:10       Do any PR like pills with it, like five HTP or anything cause you won't have that. You just had a really bad experience because you didn't creed, planet and Post Planet.

Speaker 1:          01:18:21       Yeah, I took two pills too. I think you're only supposed to take one the first time you do it and whatever. What, but whatever the point is, it was profound and it made me understand a lot about, um, about insecurities, mine and other peoples about love and about what's possible. If you're warm, you know, the, the, the warmth and friend friendliness and happiness, that that shit is contagious and it spreads and good, good energy spreads just as easily as bad energy does. But good energy is, it's way better. It's way better for you. It feels better and it's possible for anyone to change in midstream. It's possible for anyone to just start slowly adjusting their life into a more harmonious path. And that includes all the people that are running shit. And guess what? Along the way, a lot of you motherfuckers are probably going to wind up getting busted doing something stupid.

Speaker 1:          01:19:17       You know, there's probably a lot of people right now that are, that have like gambling problems or you know, prostitution problems or you know x fill in the blank that it's all gonna come to light. All of it's going to come to light. There's no way to avoid it. But I think ultimately it's the, the best thing for everybody that we are moving in a way, and this is very science fiction utopian, but we're moving in a way where we're going to merge consciousness. That seems to me to be the only step that's at the end of this path. If you look at what's going on, the complete lack of privacy that we now have in regards to the way we interface with the government. The government can check your emails, the government can check, your tax, government could check a Twitter, and I think eventually you and I are going to have that same issue. We all going to be able to access all of each other's emails. We're all going to be able to contact each other. We're all going to be able to, what comes after that? Well, the only thing that comes after that is some sort of a convergence of consciousness. It's going to be whether it's technologically created or whether it's biologically induced as the next step in evolution. Whatever the fuck it is. It seems like that's where it's going. I mean, otherwise what does it do? It just stops

Speaker 3:          01:20:29       and let's be all in plug. I mean, none of us. That's the one thing that we're not the worst to have his cell phone. We're not forced to do any of this. We could just like a seriously turn off her phone and then we're off the map. I honestly, yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:20:39       I think the only thing that would get more than a few random Weirdos to unplug is a cataclysmic disaster. Something that wipes out cell phone signals, a massive solar flare that torches every satellite makes a start from scratch, whatever it is, something that fries every fucking electrical system all over the globe.

Speaker 3:          01:20:58       I've had a Weirdos contact me and they're like, uh, I would like to share your stuff, but I don't use Facebook because of the, you know, they track you and I'm like, oh well you can, you know, you can post it on Twitter I guess, or whatever. I was like, why don't use Twitter either. Like you could post on message boards, like why use tor encryption or I use the tor browser. I don't like to go to websites too frequently. Then just don't fucking live. You know? Like if you're going to be that paranoid. Yeah. You think that Twitter and Facebook are concerned about everything you're posting? Well not only that, you have no influence. Your just the nobody in the forest. And Are you doing shady shit? 24, seven. You know the government, if you want to beat off to, I'm going to offer the government something.

Speaker 3:          01:21:34       If you want to beat off the same websites, I beat off to look at my history. Okay, go ahead. I'm not doing anything negative. I'm not fighting the power. Hoo Hoo. I got, I do beat off a lot. Fed is up a porn. You got to check out man, uh, getting Dick for their first time. Oh my God, it's great. And I was talking to this lesbian the other day and she's like, yeah, I broke up with like this girl that was in a relationship for a long time and I went right to having Dick, you know, for like a month. [inaudible] mean like lesbian. Do you mean a strap on or like a Dick? Like she decided to fuck a guy that she was friends with. What happened? And she says it was great, but you know, if she's back into lesbian now because whatever for whatever reasons. But I've, so I've been looking at porn, you know, like lesbian gets first dick ever and it's just like the butch dykes and they're just like, what the fuck? This is amazing. It's great. It's good. It's a good, I knew a search for the first time. Yeah. Yeah. I think they're all in denial. All you girls out there that say you don't like Dick when I never had deck. And that's how they all are having had the right one yet. I feel

Speaker 1:          01:22:36       I have a joke in my act about that. About how no guy see two girls work in that working out. Okay, stop. I quit jokes over. No Guy sees two girls making out and says, aw, too bad they don't like dudes. Guys don't think like, like

Speaker 3:          01:22:52       that. You Go, I just gotta get in there. We just get closer while we're, uh, while we're talking about Dicks, there is a funny story on reddit recently, how, you know how you always say powerful and now it's like everybody uses powerful. Yeah, it's like this. And he stole that

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       from my friend Larry. By the way. Everybody is, I think Verizon uses powerful now in their ad campaigns. They should send you a royalty checks. But, uh, so people, people take up other people's phrases, people say powerful now because of what you say. Right. And on Reddit, this guy was complaining that his college roommate, I was one of those people who's like, just absorbs all this social stuff around him and uses other people's phrases like immediately and just adopts their personality. So as a prank, they play it on this guy. They started off saying, Dick in my ass, whenever, whenever something bad would happen or they would lose it halo. And within like within a week, this guy is showing up to this class late and yelling like Dick in my ass. Like I knew I should have showed up earlier. And I'm like, just saying it all the time. Oh my God. That's hilarious. Then it was a plot. Yeah. It was this carefully orchestrated test that's so rude and mean.

Speaker 1:          01:23:55       Oh, the poor guy. But he feels devastated. That's great. And knowing that he was played like that. That's so common though, if you're insecure. Especially when I was, uh, when I was really young, I had a Boston accent and they didn't live in Boston that long. I lived in Boston from the time I was 13 till I was like 24. But I had a Boston accent and I didn't realize it until I heard myself on TV. I was 19. I heard myself on TV just getting interviewed. And, uh, it was like, God, we've been working really had, I was like, oh no. I realized that I wanted to be like everybody else so badly. I started talking like,

Speaker 5:          01:24:28       well, it's also very strong. It's like shit in a pool on that. So, you know, it's just going to stick really. But I moved there when I was 13, so six years later I have a stupid accent. That's ridiculous. No, it was a sheep man. I was scared. I wanted to be like everybody around me. I wanted to fit right in, you know, uh, how they used to talk weird and like the forties and 50s. Oh yeah. St The don draper of coping really well. How'd they talk? Uh, give me an example. Like the admin voice, like a, you know, like on the battle front tonight, like Blah Blah Blah, you know, very official. I mean in the media they did that like anchors and actors and actresses to, I would like to know what you talked like in real life though. I read this recently, apparently that accent is called, it's either called the Trans Atlantic or the trans continental accent and it was not actually used by Americans back then.

Speaker 5:          01:25:13       It was something, it was taught in boarding school. It was considered like the proper way to speak. So if you were a TV anchor or a famous actor, you would use that onset. But Americans back then spoke like us, which blows my mind. What I thought that they all talk, like, you know, like mad men or not mad at him like the 20 years before that, I thought that was real. But that's just the way they, the way they talk on TV and on radio. And then when they're offset, they're talking like us. Is there any documentaries or I want to, you don't want to fact check this one to get more info, but I'm pretty certain I'm right on this. Is there any

Speaker 1:          01:25:46       be awesome if we saw a reality show from the 30s like could you imagine jersey shore from the 30s

Speaker 5:          01:25:52       no, I can't actually ride around a model t's right.

Speaker 1:          01:25:56       Fucking, you know, I mean just to imagine what it would have been like to be around some people that just survived.

Speaker 5:          01:26:02       Let's the main question tonight.

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       That's why I like to watch boardwalk empire cause you're seeing a, I mean it's probably glamorized obviously, but yeah, it's just entertaining as hell to see people. Yeah. Period. That's a brilliant show. But it is probably glamorized. That's the problem with the, anything in regards to the history, there's so much guesswork. There's so much. Uh, it would be really cool to watch a documentary about some people that lived in the 1930s and just, just to follow them around. But then again, how comfortable would they be on camera? That's the real issue. You would have to experience it yourself. Yeah. It's hard to reach back into your memory and have an accurate account of anything more than five or six years ago. Really. Right.

Speaker 5:          01:26:41       Uh, yeah. I mean this is all such new stuff. Like I saw a black and white photo set of these guys getting there after work drinks at some pub in, uh, in England. And so that to me was, it seemed like an accurate picture of what was happening then. Cause you see that these dudes are just drinking after work. No cell phones on the table. No bullshit. Just like average w because you don't have any technology back then. And you could see that their clothes were not as, like not as polished as you seen all the movies from that era. You could see like, you know, tatters and stuff. You're like, oh, they're actually living through a pretty tough time. You know, you can see that without the, the gloss that's been applied to other shows.

Speaker 1:          01:27:20       Yeah. Um, it's, it's still, it's like if you, if you could go back and live in a time like that, I would love to do that. What would you really, especially if you can pick an era, especially knowing which companies we're going to take off, but uh, oh no, no, no, you can't do that. That's illegal.

Speaker 5:          01:27:37       I would love to live in 1920s even the 1930s as long as you're not. And one of the, you know, poor families, if you're doing well in the 30s they did better than anybody.

Speaker 1:          01:27:46       Yeah. But you would be faced with so much despair. You'd be sad. I think they looked around and saw all the people

Speaker 5:          01:27:51       they coordinate themselves off from that. And the same way that we would be cool with that. Not saying I'd be cool with it, but look at the fact that, you know, when this iPhone dies, it's going to be picked apart by some child and you know, somewhere in India, some trash heap for the precious metals inside it. We still have all that same shit. It's just been distanced from us. And I think people back then had an amazing life if they are in a certain social strata. This is 1939

Speaker 1:          01:28:16       color footage, which is very rare for that, for that year. Wow. That girl was hot. She was bawling and 39 isn't it funny that like that is like someone who's probably like four feet tall now arched over and it's almost over, but she's creeping, creeping around. I don't know. It might not be, might be a crypt keeper now. Five. It's unbelievable. It's like we just, we have a short amount of time here.

Speaker 5:          01:28:44       I think about how weird it is that all those people smoked constantly. So even like the hottest girl you'd hook up with somebody who's smoking a couple packs a day has like lines all over their face from just nonstop smoking all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:28:57       Have you ever met someone and uh, then you saw them in like five years

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       and it was like a hundred years had gone by. Some people do not age well. Oh, well if someone gets on Meth, that's the big one. I've seen the alcohol. Yeah, I guess I like to tell myself that I think preserving, preserving my body alcohol is, that's what I like to tell myself. It might be in a way because he relaxed a little bit and maybe you feel a little bit more positive energy and that counteracts all the continents in the world. Right? You know, there, there's, there's definitely some benefit to alcohol, but you poisoning yourself.

Speaker 3:          01:29:32       Did you hear that? I wanted to see if you saw that article that was on today.com about bulletproof coffee. I don't know if you saw that or not.

Speaker 4:          01:29:38       No, I did not. What did it say? It's bad.

Speaker 3:          01:29:40       Uh, well they said that, you know, the reports of putting butter in your coffee today. Dot Com. It's a, I, I tweeted it earlier. Uh, they sit there saying that, you know, there's no, uh, evidence that butter in your coffee does anything but it has more calories. Here's the actual article, I guess that's Today. Like NBC today, I guess.

Speaker 4:          01:30:07       Well, let me, let me just give you some input right away. First of all, coffee caffeine has shown how benefits shown to have benefits on cognitive function shown to have obviously obvious benefits on energy. So there's that. Then when you take coffee with grass fed butter and MCT oil and they talk about the MCT oil here, what it does is it makes it a slower digestible thing. Like it's, it takes a longer time for your body to process it. Whereas if you have just like a Venti Starbucks black that goes like right in your bloodstream song didn't have bulletproof coffee. If you have grass fed butter and MCT oil, you're going to get a lot more calories and it's a lot fatter and it's all blended together and so it will take hours for your body to digest that as opposed to just the straight coffee.

Speaker 4:          01:30:58       I've lost weight using MCT oil. Mct Oil is very good for, you know, a debate about that. If you don't know what it is, it's a medium chain triglyceride oil and um, it's the most healthy aspect of coconut oil. They take coconut oil and they have some sort of a process with the centrifuge. And coconut oil is one of the best things I've heard. One of the best oils you can use to jerk off to. Yeah, it's supposed to be really good for that. That's what I hear too. I just here. Um, so if you're, you know, if you don't have an issue with cholesterol, um, I wouldn't think there's anything wrong with bulletproof coffee, but if you do have an issue with cholesterol, you're dealing with, even though everybody says it's healthy cholesterol, we live in a strange world and some people have like real health problems with all sorts of things that for other folks would be no problem whatsoever.

Speaker 4:          01:31:49       So if you thinking about taking, you know, um, bulletproof coffee, you know, look into it, find out what your, you know, we, where your body's at, unless you know you're okay. But if, okay, with high cholesterol foods or high calorie foods, the benefit of the bulletproof coffee recipe is that it takes a longer time for you to digest it. So basically it said all the benefits of coffee with, um, a slower digestion period. So there's nothing mystery mysterious about it. There's nothing magical about it. Well, the, the amount that you drink every day, which is a huge, like Starbucks, like what does that Trenta Trenta canister? It's 20 ounces. So they're saying like each cup of coffee, just a cup of coffee has about a hundred to 200 calories in it. So you're eating a ton of cow. That's enough. And that's not including the fat, but what, what they're including the fat.

Speaker 4:          01:32:41       That's the whole idea of calories. The calories come from. Yeah, but I mean, I'm sorry. Some diets you, you want it, you're, you're looking at calories and fat intake. But uh, and this, this thing that the claim here is it that MCT, because it's faster digesting compared to other fats is an energy booster. But there's no evidence in this, but they're pretty much just saying that, you know, uh, it, uh, be mindful of the extra calories. Don't expect weight loss or enter any extra energy. That's not necessarily true because it really is filling. And if you take 300 or 400 calories in the form of bulletproof coffee in the morning, you might not eat until one o'clock in the afternoon and you might feel good. You might, you're not feeling depleted because you're getting all these healthy fats and MCT oil and grass fed butter.

Speaker 4:          01:33:27       And that's where it's really important because grass fed animals are far healthier than corn fed animals. And see the difference in the, the tube steak cuts clearly, and this is not, this is not hippy bullshit. If you look at a cut of grass fed Sirloin, you will see a dark red color. It looks leaner. It's a different cut of meat, like a grass Fed New York strips. Perfect example cause very little fat on that. But if you look at a regular New York strip from corn fed, you know you're, you're going to get like this. It's all more marble. More pink. Yeah. I mean that's, it tastes delicious because it's that fat makes it all juicy and it cooks down, but it's really not as healthy that you're not getting as much out of the, the meat itself. It's not as good for you. Well that's the same with butter.

Speaker 4:          01:34:14       You're, you're getting butter from an animal that's corn fed. You're going to give this fat, sloppy, stupid cow who's shitting out pus in her milk? You know, it's the same with a not good for you. Same with eggs. I think if you get the regular, the regular cheap eggs, they have thin shells, not as much a mega threes versus the more expensive like cage free. All these freeze which you want because they're, they're roaming around and they're eating grass. If you can get a chicken seeding grass, that's a chicken that's healthy. But somewhere along the line somebody figured out, well we can make more money if we just stack them in like apartment complexes and shove all these chickens and these little boxes and feed him the horse freedom. The Monsanto grass. Yeah, it's, you know, it's unfortunate and that's also

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       a part of this whole big picture where people don't want to have to go hunting. They don't want to have to go kill a bird. They don't want to raise chickens, they don't want to raise goats. We want to be able to go to McDonald's and they wanted to be able to just give their money and get their food and be done with it. And when you have that, then you're going to have this, you're going to have a regular person is not going to be able to just produce for themselves or for a small group of people. They're going to have to produce for thousands, maybe even millions. And so when a company or a person or a business is producing all this food for millions of people, and these billions of people can just pull into these stops with their cars, which you've got his madness. Yeah. We've got this massive disconnect from responsibility

Speaker 5:          01:35:40       to make money off of shit that is that cheap to begin with. You have to be working with really cheap materials. Yeah. So you're cutting costs wherever you can.

Speaker 1:          01:35:47       I mean, if you're buying a $3 cheeseburger without fucking what is in that thing, imagine if someone only paid you $3. Say, listen man, this one wants you to do, I want you to shoot a cow and then a take, ship it across the country, cut a chunk of meat out of it, and I want you to grind that meat and then form it into a patty. And then I want you to cook it. And then I want you to put that I would get some lettuce. You got to get some, let us go get it. Go pick the lettuce and then wash it off and then cut some tomatoes. And then polo onion on there. And then I want you to make some ketchup. And then I want you to make some mustard and swirl it all around. And then I want you to cook it and feed it to me.

Speaker 1:          01:36:23       How much would that cost? $3. It would be a $100. Look at norms, man. You have steak and eggs for what? $7 that Saint Nicholas. But at least you norms. You sit down, you know, norms is like, they're trying to be frugal and it's probably released. You sit down, right? This drive through shit. The craziest thing ever. A cheeseburger please. Is that it? Yep. That's it. $2 and 50 cents please. $2 50 cents. That's crazy. You give him $2 and 50 cents and then they eat it and then you go like somehow or another that cow died. That bread was cooked, that's ketchup was manufactured. That pickle was pickled. It was sliced, it was slapped on your bond. It takes

Speaker 5:          01:37:03       the social out of, uh, out of eating. I think one of the most fun things to do is sit down with people that you're interested in, have like a nice solid dinner. Even if it's just a burger or something. But now you're like in your car by yourself. You know, you park, cause you don't wanna be on the highway while you're trying to down this thing. You Park your and your car by yourself. Just eating something like an animal. It just kind of consume these just consuming calories as quickly as possible so you can get on your way. Rose are talking about health stuff. I wanted to ask you about flotation tanks because I did one in Florida recently for the first time. Did you select it? I liked it a lot, but I didn't get any of the, the cool visuals that were talked about on the videos. How far, how many times did you do it? I did it for an hour. A One? Yeah, just once so far toward the end. Uh, I saw like kind of like a doll, white flash on my right side and I thought that somebody had the tank,

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       but it was just like me, I guess fantasizing about the tank being opened because I knew that it was around that time. But other than that, there are no visuals at all. It's just much visualizations. The first time I did it. Okay. So that's normal man. Oh yeah. It's completely normal. It's hard to relax, you know, it's a weird environment. The like the first 1520 minutes, you just freaking out that you're in this weird tank. Well then I could hear my own heartbeat and feel the blood pumping through my body. It's pretty weird. It doesn't feel great though, and he fly. I explained it in there. It's like taking myself on a date. You're just like, they're like, it's weird to explain to them. That's a good way to describe it. Nothing really happened, but at the same time, the rest of that afternoon was awesome.

Speaker 3:          01:38:35       Yeah, everything was bright and I was almost grateful for stimulation because I'm a very like very intense type a kind of person, so to be in a fucking thing for an hour and have nothing going on except for my own thoughts afterwards, it's like I'm in traffic driving back from Delray and I'm like, this is great. I love traffic. You know something to think about like dodge these other cards, you know? That's funny. Hallucinate at all. Joe, during when you were rolfing? No. What does Ross painful but you don't loosen. I hallucinate when it's painful massage. It's like the time it starts. The other day I was just like seeing all this crazy shit and it was so high. No, I don't like, I don't like Thai massages. They put you on the ground and they stretch you out. You don't like, I love that. I love, I like being on a table.

Speaker 3:          01:39:16       The oil you up, it's nice stretch you out. It's better for your body. Like it doesn't feel as good, but it's better for your body. Little snail trails everywhere. It's Ho Hey, I don't even know what those are. I don't know if I want to know. Well you do want to know you and Brian Hook up after the show. He'll show you. I'll show you pictures of the NSA is doubtless already seen. They're starting, they're going to shut down the program because they're so repulsed by Brian's tragic snail trail folders. 17 barf. It's funny, I read that, uh, like some huge percentage of internet users put their porn in a file called tax return. They do like tax returns 2007 and a lot of people do it. So, so people go, just go looking, right? So if your, if your wife or girlfriend is looking through your computer, last thing she wants to click on is your boring tax return so it gets skipped over.

Speaker 3:          01:40:07       That's funny. A friend of mine called would just put it under call. I was like my girlfriend and go look at golf. All you have to do is put it in a folder and change the file extension from a folder to like a jpeg and call it something like sample dot jpeg. And then when you tried to click on it and nothing will happen because there'll be an error. And then when you want to look at your porn, it can switch it back to switch factor. Nice. No chicks going to figure that out. Dude, you're on a next level CSI shit. You should really be working for the NSA dog. Why are you wasting all your talent here on podcasts? Um, is there a way to fix this Shit, David Seaman? Yeah. I'm glad you asked that because like you said, I am a really positive person. I'm not, I'm not a cynic. I'm not somebody who, when you're hanging out with me, I'm complaining about everything. Cause I think 98%

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       of human existence and probably like 99% of human existence in the United States is amazing. You don't have access to so much entertainment, so much cool shit to do constantly that there's no, if you're bored and you're over the age of 18, that's your own fault, you know? But, uh, I was watching this lecture that Glenn Greenwald gave at Hampshire college and the videos on Youtube, that's how I watched it. Uh, it's like an hour long lecture and then a Q and a session. And Glenn Greenwald is the journalist who initially broke, uh, this NSA whistleblower story. He published it in the Guardian and Glenn Greenwald has been all over civil rights for like years. He used to be a lawyer, so he knows his stuff and he's super thorough. And you would think a guy like that would be really cynical by breaking all these terrible stories about abuses at Guantanamo and all this stuff.

Speaker 5:          01:41:41       But he said in his lecture, he was like, the one thing we have to keep in mind is even the most powerful institutions throughout human history or just composed of human beings like you and me. And it's been shown throughout history, regardless of the civilization, that when enough human beings get together and decide that that institution is no longer functioning properly and either needs to be shut down or reformed in some way, that happens without exception pretty much, you know, like that can happen. And we're talking about these agencies as if they're, you know, some monolithic thing is just compose the people who go home at the end of the day and want to see their kids and they want to save up enough money to not work in a cubicle anymore one day. And, uh, the people outside of that system just don't want to be spied on and they don't want to have this country turn into East Germany where people no longer do anything because they're afraid of the consequences.

Speaker 5:          01:42:30       Like you look at East Germany, no great art came out of that country when it was in lockdown. A No great inventions that I know of. And why is that? It's because everybody just wants to get by without attracting attention. And that's not what the United States should be. We're the, we're the total opposite of that where you get as much attention as you want and hopefully you'll do something valuable in the process. That's our system. And if you want more attention than you deserve, there's a repercussion for that. Right? Then you get, you get slammed down by the, you know, the people who make fun of the cardiac issues. There's a balance. But if you get a situation where the normal person is now afraid of what they're saying in their emails and phone calls, how many months does it take before? Okay, first of all, the journalism dries up and then the protests dry up and then the entrepreneurs dry up because they go, I could make this app, that'll make it easier for you to pay for your food.

Speaker 5:          01:43:19       Uh, but I'm a little bit worried about the government doing what they did to the bitcoin guys. So I'm just going to stay at my shitty job and not develop this incredible app that could be the next paypal. And then before you know it, the u s is no longer this innovative hub and it's all just happening in Europe or in fucking New Zealand where Kim Dotcom is. And he's the one who's making all the money off of it because they trust him more than they trust American entrepreneurs. And that's not, why should we go down that road when that's not our history. That's not what we believe in. You know, it's just, I think there's a, it's total bullshit. Yeah. There's Ernest Hemingway quote about America. This is a fine place and it's worth fighting for. And I feel that way. You know, like I was walking around near my hotel earlier today and the houses in this neighborhood nearby or not big houses, they're just modest homes. Everybody had an American flag out front, I guess, cause they're getting ready for the 4th of July. Everything was quiet and peaceful. And people have nice cars, you know, like nice pickup trucks and stuff. America's worth fighting for. You know, like we're a peaceful, smart, uh, chill people. We don't need to continue to go down this road of being afraid of everything and everything being kept in the dark from us. Like we're little children and we can't handle it. It's really patronizing and it's not our system. Do you think

Speaker 1:          01:44:31       that the time of the country is limited? The time, the idea of the country and the embracing the idea of a global civil right.

Speaker 5:          01:44:39       I, I think we're just getting started. We're just getting started. Yeah. I mean, you look at, look at Rome. It's not as if things stopped and they became imperial. That's really when the fun began, you know? I mean, we have a lot of shit ahead of us and it's not all going to be bad stuff. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:44:52       It isn't all going to be bad stuff and I'm, I'm, I'm wondering how much of that can be impressed upon the people that are in power. So it doesn't have to be bad. Like you can actually run this in a good way. You fucks, like someone can come along who has a enough ideas of how this can be structured, where it can be. The people still get to make money and people still get to have order and people still get to have laws and there's still respect and there's still, but

Speaker 5:          01:45:20       some people are already doing that. Uh, I was in Uruguay last year, fairly small South American country I think right next to Brazil. And uh, I was there and their president is known as like one of the most, uh, how do you put this like one of the least selfish presidents of the world and still like the still the figurehead for a fairly successful country. Uh, so he gives away like 80% of his salary to charity and t his hobbies instead of being obsessed with getting invited to stuff like Bilderberg. He Gardens with his longterm girlfriend, they plant flowers, he drives an old VW beetle. Like one of the ones from the 70s. Yeah, he drives an old beetle. And what's funny is his past is really like a messed up. He spent I think a decade in a well in prison as a political prisoner and he had been shot by police at some point and all this stuff.

Speaker 5:          01:46:12       But instead of becoming radical and becoming this like anti anti wealth kind of South American radical, uh, who wants to seek to get revenge, he just became a total moderate. And you know, he'd gardens and he's the president. People love him and he looks like, like what a South American dictator would look like. You know, he's like this old jovial white guy, right? Instead of going down that path of just acquiring more and more power, he's like, fuck it. Like we're going to have a free country. And I think that's something that more and more world leaders could probably aspire to.

Speaker 1:          01:46:42       How much of, yeah. I mean, how much of the direction of civilization has really dictated by charismatic individuals? I mean, it's, it's so often than someone in a right way or wrong way

Speaker 5:          01:46:52       lead. We'll look at Hitler, Hitler speeches. I watched this thing. When you look at Kennedy speech, I watched this thing where they subtitled his speeches. So you could see what it's actually sang because I've always wondered how could people go along with this raving lunatic, right? And be like, yeah, yeah, we should put the Jews in the homosexuals and the ovens. You know, this sounds good. Uh, how could they go along with this? The Germans are smart and if you look at the subtitles of his speeches, he's saying stuff like, you know, when one German needs help and other German should reach out because that's what we're about as a country is you help out another German who's down, you know, down on his luck and we move each other forward together. All this shit that like, you can see why people would go along with it. It wasn't right. It wasn't craziness. And then behind the scenes he's doing all of this really terrible shit. And uh,

Speaker 1:          01:47:36       so he spoke to the common folk.

Speaker 5:          01:47:37       Yeah. I guess where I'm going with this is you're 100% right, that there are a handful of charismatic people that have a huge amount of influence on what direction would

Speaker 1:          01:47:47       I like to think that in this day and age that that's changing. I really do. I like to think that in this day and age, because we live in this new paradigm and you and I have accepted it because we have no vested interest in keeping the past. You know, we didn't have any control and you, he neither you nor I had any control over the way. The world worked a decade, two decades ago, so there's no, we have no vested interest in keeping the thing the way it is now. We recognize that the world is changing. We recognize that society is changing. People are fucking smarter, man. They're smarter, they're smarter and they're more aware and they're more tuned in and it's not as easy to fucking trick on. You see it with entertainment. You see it with talk shows. You see it with the criticism, criticism of a newspaper, articles and books and blogs. People are more tuned in now than they ever have been before.

Speaker 5:          01:48:37       Well, it's funny, a financial newsletters used to be really big in the 90s where people would subscribe to some experts, stock picks, and he would say, you know, I'm up 18% for the past year. Uh, you know, whatever. And people would subscribe, thinking, Oh, if I just listened to what this guy says, I'll make 1800% per year. And uh, I almost went to work for a company earlier this year that reached out to me. And what they do is they've found a way to actually audit these people whose results. So they go, oh, okay, let's actually see what you've been buying and selling. You didn't make 18 per 1800% this year. You made like 10%. And so they publish all the results and people pay for access to that information. And so what you're seeing is this one area that used to be really scammy is now moving closer and closer to total transparency where you know, if you're the real thing and you're actually picking the right stocks, then you're going to, you're going to gain more followers than you ever would have before because people see that you're the real thing and if your bullshit, nobody's going to go down that road.

Speaker 5:          01:49:35       And I feel like it'd be great if we get get that going for other areas of, than other than stock newsletters, like let's get going for government agencies, let's get it going for anything. Like just show the people the actual numbers, let them decide for themselves if this is something that we want to do and if not, it'll go away.

Speaker 1:          01:49:51       It seems like that's what a lot of people are terrified of. Yeah. A lot of people are terrified about having to do that. Having to rise to the occasion, having to recognize that we live in a completely new world and that there's a lot more competition because there's a lot more access to the game and

Speaker 5:          01:50:06       well people say stuff, they're like, well, should we have that much competition? And you really, you do want that because, so like if you have, that's a funny thing to say, she'll, there'll be that much competition will say things like the stock market is good. Like it is now being closed on weekends and stuff. But ultimately you want total information exchange at all times. You'd want 24 seven like commodities markets. Right. And so people are like arguing for this old shit. And you're like, well why are you arguing for that when it's less transparent? You just want, ideally you want people to be able to do anything at any time as long as it doesn't harm other people.

Speaker 1:          01:50:38       Yeah, absolutely. And then includes online gambling, online porn, online, anything there. The idea of regulating human behavior is completely ridiculous. If that human behavior doesn't hurt other people. And if it's not, then it's about controlling resources. And if it's about controlling resources, it becomes about why should one person be able to tell you what you can and can't do if you're not in somehow or another imprisoning or doing something fucked up to other people. If you're not, then they shouldn't be that long. There's just too many. There's too much. There's too much business and enforcing it. There's too much business and manipulating words in order to control humans. And that's what I think everybody's freaking out about when it comes to the NDA or and, or the Patriot Act.

Speaker 5:          01:51:23       Well, this, uh, to this section to 15 of the Patriot Act, they have a secret interpretation of it and that's how the NSA is doing all of this data collection. Or at least that's the foundation for some of it, I believe. And uh, how ludicrous is that? Like the Patriot Act is scary enough what it actually says, but then you have the government saying, oh no, no, we have this secret interpretation in a lock box that you can't actually look at. But our secret interpretation allows us to do a, B, and C. It'd be like if you signed a contract and then, uh, the guy doesn't pay you. It had been agreed upon and you take him to court and you sue them and he's like, no, you can't sue me because actually you have a secret interpretation of your, your compensation on his contract. You'd be like, that's totally fucking insane. There's no basis in law for that. But the government is doing this stuff and up until, you know, the past few weeks, people have not really been calling them out on it. I mean, of course some people have, but it hasn't gone mainstream and the way that it is now.

Speaker 1:          01:52:14       Yeah. Well you're talking about everything accelerating, you know, uh, they're experiencing that now too. There's experiencing that slowly but surely. I was like, one, two, three, four.

Speaker 5:          01:52:25       When you look at all these amendment, these whistleblowers, he's like, what the third or fourth guy from the NSA alone, how bad must things be there that you were willing to give up everything to come out and talk to the press?

Speaker 1:          01:52:37       Yeah. Well, there's some people that feel like they're compelled. There's real heroes in this world. You know, like what Pat Tillman did. I'm that guy a, he

Speaker 4:          01:52:45       was the football player. Yeah. He was a professional football league player superstar and decided he wanted to go and defend this country. So he risked it all and went over to Afghanistan or Iraq, wherever it was killed, I think it was Afghanistan and uh, found that it was a big fucking shit pile. Once he got there, it was completely disorganized. It was a mess. And it was very vocal about it. Some people though that they really will do with this guy's done and step up and say, hey, you know, this needs to be discussed and talked about and everyone's chasing after him and everyone is talking about, and this cover of USA Today, x percent think he should be prosecuted and blah, blah blah. But the bottom line is all the sudden that dialogue is open, all of a sudden that conversation is being had.

Speaker 4:          01:53:31       Who are these people that are allowed to read David Seaman's email and why can they, aren't they just people? And Weird things happen when you call yourself the NSA or the CIA or the FBI. You know, when you become part of a group, you can do some weird shit. Even when you call yourself district manager, weird stuff happens. Yeah. You go from like being an objective observer. But what happened to, well I can't return more than a certain percentage of shirts because it'll make my numbers look bad. So he had to swing. He's no longer acting out of total objective reality and they have a vested interest in some kind of outcome and you multiply that times that thousand and you get the national security agency. Yeah. But uh, to go back to being positive and I think we're headed for a star trek future. Like if you, if you watch like star Trek, next generation, not the, the new, uh, you know, major motion pictures that are just action flex.

Speaker 4:          01:54:26       But that whole ideal view that hundreds of years from now, people have so much abundance in terms of energy and information that money is no longer the focus. Cause if you want to get an education, it will be given to you because it won't cost us that much to do it. So if you want to get education online. Yeah, exactly. That's what I mean. Like you'll get an education, all the education you need a, if you need healthcare, it's going to be so commoditized, so easy to provide a level of care. You'll get that. If you want to fly across the country, it's going to cost you almost nothing because one of the big, uh, costs right now to fly is the jet fuel. It's not the least of the airplane. It's not the shitty wages they pay to the pilot and the stewardess is, it's actually the jet fuel that's burning.

Speaker 4:          01:55:06       What about when you, when we move away from that, that kind of, uh, that era and get something better to power all of our vehicles, then it changes everything because then FedEx something across the country, it doesn't cost much anymore either. Before you know it, you have a society where you just don't have to pay for all that much stuff. How about this? How about when it's down to everybody acquiring raw materials because you have a three d printer in your house that's going to know ever has to buy anything that's going to be absolute crisis that's coming. You're going to be able to download the instructions and the directions for your laptop. Make your own fleshlight making anything that's happening too. For sure. I think it's basically going to be anything, I think it's going to

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       start off just like printers were where you know they were only black and white and you have to have a big office to have a laser and it took forever to print it out. Yeah, I mean it's completely changed. It's changed radically. The ability to download an image. I remember who used to be like click, click, click, click, click, click. It was like really slow to get like a, you know, one megabyte jpeg. Now it's instantaneous. There's, there's gonna come a time when everyone can just get what they want online. You're going to be able to download the instructions and people are going to probably have some sort of a paypal system or some sort of a, you know, a, a donation system where they'll, they'll, hey, I invented this and they'll upload it and people donate a bunch of money to them to, to be able to use it and they'll find merit in it. If they find merit in it and they have the resources, they'll, they'll upload the money to this person and that person will be able to benefit from it.

Speaker 5:          01:56:37       Yeah. If you live in America, even today, if you have a truly great idea and you put it out on, you know, whatever these sites, our Indiegogo and Kickstarter, you can get the money you need to make your dream a reality. And uh, that's extraordinary. That didn't exist until very recently and it will be a reasonable, you would pitch a bank and if it wasn't something they thought would produce a return and you didn't have the right credit profile, you'd be denied. And now you can just put it on Kickstarter. Nobody cares about anything other than is the idea worthy?

Speaker 1:          01:57:05       Yeah, no doubt. Alex Grey's Kickstarter, he came on the podcast to talk about it and um, within, I don't know, a couple of days, his, his Kickstarter had gone over $200,000. That's a beautiful thing. It's, it's a, it's a, it's a weird thing that you can do that today. It's $210,000 now. And that was like within days we watched that change. It's like all people have to do is be alerted to a good idea. And then they look at the Kickstarter, oh, this is a very reasonable offer. He has all these really cool things that he's going to give you. He's going to, he'll draw an image of you for x amount of money. He'll give you free tickets to the opening event. Theone for this amount of money. And in doing something like that and creating something like that, he essentially like organized and, and, and, and, and energized this base of supporters. And then, you know, if you have a million fans and the x amount of them give you money, boom, you're up and running. You don't need to sell your diktat Nestle. You don't need to stick your ass up in the air for Coca Cola. You do whatever you want. You can do whatever you want.

Speaker 5:          01:58:08       Yeah. It takes away the power from, uh, the guy was the guy got dinner with last night as a TV producer and he's friends with, uh, the guy who produces Philip defranco show. And he was one of the bigger youtube shows. And he was talking about how now, like these networks just don't matter because it's, all they have is like, they're like, we've been around for 60 years. And somebody who started two years ago, I was like, well, that doesn't fucking matter anymore if we're producing better content than we're actually competitive. And you're seeing now that location doesn't matter either. You know, looking at what's his name is sai or Gangnam style [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       even though he's not in like a hotbed of us music, he instantly took off over here because of this technology. We have no watching five Asian, you're up dance around and looking weird with hot Asian girls. But then we hope they don't get the fuck before we do. I guess what I'm saying is if the idea is good, it propagates now in a way that was just impossible even 10 years ago. Oh for sure. You know, I mean, look, this podcast has never been advertised anywhere. We haven't done anything. All we've done is just keep doing it. And in doing that, it's built a completely organic word of mouth. I mean, I've talked to people about, if they asked me about it in interviews, I've done nothing to try to promote this podcast as far as like commercially and it sorta just caught on on its own.

Speaker 4:          01:59:26       And I think honestly, it'd be a slower road for someone who's not famous. But it's possible for like almost anybody today. And I know you have a podcast now and by you putting your ideas out there on the Internet, you gained a lot of support when you were going to run for Congress. And then that support bled over to, you know, things that I came in contact with. And then you and I came in contact with each other and you came on this show and then you started going on a bunch of other shows and then they're all sorta of webs out from each other. You didn't have any important family that you came from, you didn't have any, uh, you know, privileged influence. Well you had a brother who was the president of the night or there was nothing like that. Well, I think we're just a guy.

Speaker 4:          02:00:08       It's a, it's funny because the things that I thought used to be my weaknesses and this new environment are actually your biggest strengths. Like I was kind of deeply insecure back when I was a journalist and now I'm a journalist again because the congressional thing, I think that was a little delusional on my part to think that you can jump in there and hope to have any kind of chance, uh, to, to be taken seriously. But, uh, now that I'm back to doing journalism, the things that I used to be really insecure about that I wasn't working for a TV network and didn't have, you know, New York Times or NBC News after my name. Those are actually your biggest strengths today because people go, Oh, if, if this guy knows about something, he's not going to hold back. He's going to do the research and put it out there.

Speaker 4:          02:00:47       And the other thing that I'm not afraid to do that I think more journalists should do is put things into perspective for people. People are busy, you know, I sat there reading for this boring national security stuff and then I'm able to pick out what's important and tell people this matters. And then sometimes people will tweet me something that seems like a really big deal. And I'll debunk it. I'm like, actually it's problematic, but it probably doesn't matter because of a, B and c and people need that cause there's no sense of perspective anymore. You go to the homepage of Yahoo and it's something about Obama, some huge meeting with, you know, Merkel in Germany. And then the next line, right next to it is Kim Kardashians baby. And then the line below that is the Duggar family or the Doug, ours, whatever they're called, that have 19 kids.

Speaker 4:          02:01:26       The reality TV horse, it's them. And so it fucks with your mind cause you're like, are these things all equally important? These, this is what's most important in the world today are these three stories. And you need people who are not compromised by the system, who have a no paycheck coming directly from a news organization to just say, yeah, this is really important. People should pay attention to it. Or this is bullshit. It's just being hyped and it's not that big a deal. Well essentially there's always going to be a need for junk food. Yeah. And there's gonna be a need for intellectual junk food as well. And much like actual food. If you offer people intellectual junk food, there's a certain group of us and I lump me in there as well that will self sabotage and they will, they, they will eat junk food and they will have a cheeseburger and then when this should really have a salad and they will watch intellectual junk food when maybe it would do them better to sit down and read a book or to watch Nova or to, you know, see a documentary.

Speaker 4:          02:02:24       There's sometimes you don't want to watch documentary. You want to watch a bunch of assholes bid on storage space, you know, and it does, it doesn't make any fucking sense. And that's, that's good too. Like there's no reason that you have to do serious stuff all day long. You're right. I, uh, I certainly don't subscribe to that, but you're a balanced person and if you're an imbalance person, much like people who would just eat cheeseburgers, you're going to have intellectual junk food 24, seven. You're going to be comforted. Your mind will be occupied by nonsense. And that's what we really need. Our minds are designed to be occupied by the pursuit of food, sustenance and sexuality. That's what we're after. We're trying to find a place to arrest someone to fuck something to eat, keep going, ready, go get up in the morning. Are you awake?

Speaker 4:          02:03:05       Okay, fill the needs and now those needs are filled. Instead you're plugged into a fucking video game and you're playing football with some digital characters and you're eating pizza, that some guy actually walked up to your fucking door and all you had to do is give them some paper that means almost nothing, and he gives you pizza and you stuffing in your fat face and go right back to your stupid game. And it's so easy to do that. It's so easy to do that as long as you can do enough to justify enough ones and Zeros coming into your, whatever your bank account is these days. It's not like the vault, the vaults are filled with paper. You know what's in that fucking fault? It's vault filled with paper that's promising. He promises inside. It's very strange. It's actually, uh, there's a great documentary, I think National Geographic did it on Fort Knox and all the controversies surrounding that.

Speaker 4:          02:03:54       What's important is a no gold, well, the one of the theories is that the gold was replaced over time with like tungsten bars or something because most people never have access to it anyway. And governments, governments swapped their goal all the time. So they're basically saying, since there's not much transparency, we don't know what's actually there. And it could have been sold off, you know, 20 years ago to some European government. And what we have here is just a bunch of blanks. That sounds like a really good movie. Yeah. Like you with Eddie Murphy and maybe Ben Stiller, they break into Fort Knox and they find out there's nothing there. Well, I think what's more fascinating stories? No, that's bank heist. The tower heist diehards almost. I liked to, it wasn't precious in tower heist. Oh yes, she was. Yeah. The woman from precious. I think the more fascinating story is let's take the government at face value and there's actually hundreds of billions of dollars of gold in this tiny little, uh, fort.

Speaker 4:          02:04:50       It's fucking incredible. It's like something out of ancient times that we have that, you know. Yeah. It's like a Mongol hoards. Exactly. That's pretty preposterous. The whole thing. We did the whole society that we live in this pretty preposterous, but I think I really do, uh, ultimately have faith in the future and I didn't when I was younger. I'm more optimistic now than ever before because I think that ultimately all there'll be some peaks and valleys in some happy and sad and some angry in some happy w the convergence, the convergence of information and the convergence of ideas is inevitable. And I think it will all balance out because of that. I think we're going to be forced because of this new reality, this new digital reality. We're going to be forced into a new level of communication, a new level of understanding and a new level of, you know, black community.

Speaker 4:          02:05:43       That's what I think. What the fuck do I know? We could all be like on the way to enlightenment, all of us doing mushrooms, holding hands, chanting ohm, and then we get hit by a meteor. Boom. I can and start from scratch. I could happen. It's interesting that people don't, even today they don't act purely out of uh, the need for more paper, for more money. Like you look at Reddit and how people research stuff nonstop and good stuff rises to the top of the page. They're just doing that for these Internet points. For Karma. They're just doing it. Basically. Other people will recognize that they're doing good work this game. In that though, and there's also a benefit in that. There's a social benefit in that when you feel good, you know, where you, you make something that people enjoy already. We're aspiring to better stuff than just a choir on it.

Speaker 4:          02:06:26       Yeah. Yeah. That's money. That is currency. It's an online currency and you know, that's what people love about posting on message boards. You know, they love getting the, the, the approval of the people around them. That's why they get so mad when they get banned. Oh, you've taken me out of my hotspot, my juicy spot. Right. And so much love there. And I've gotten so much points. You've cut my cashflow. Yeah, I've cut my, yeah, that's why I don't think any of us. We'll unplug. No, it's a, it's a ridiculous idea. Well, some people do. I love the people. I love those mountain men shows when those, my favorite shows are like Alaska, the last frontier and mountain men and ordering a Bering strait gold one. That one's awesome. Amish people are going to rule the world. No, no, because you know what man, they're boring.

Speaker 4:          02:07:12       They're wearing their dressing up like assholes and fucking driving with Rick [inaudible] to see what he talked. Well those are the people that do that rumble, that thing that they do. What is it called? Rumpl style rumble. So they have a thing they do when they become an adult and they're allowed to leave the church and go balls out and they get crazy and they party and they fuck and allowed to do it for like a year or two or whatever. And then they're supposed to like make the decision on whether or not they want to come back to the church or their snaps. Are there stats on what percentage? Say, actually this is better. I'm going to stay as a no, there's not. You know why? Because the stats are skewed by the fact that 100% of all Amish people are retarded. So those stats fuck up those other steps. Do I mean that Amish people know? But guess what? If you listen to this podcast, you're not really fucking Amish. Alright, so there because this podcast is illegal in the Amish community, not allowed to have a podcast. What's the movie inception about?

Speaker 7:          02:08:13       I don't know what it's about, but here's the,

Speaker 3:          02:08:16       Oh hey, wait, wait, no, hold on. I mean, what's the movie inception about

Speaker 7:          02:08:23       inception is about dreaming, about dreaming, about dreaming, about dreaming about something or other. I fell asleep.

Speaker 4:          02:08:32       How dare you. David's seeming sneak out to save the league or Brian gets silly. I think we can wrap this up with some, a little less doom and gloom, Brian. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. We're run by a bunch of cunts, but you know what their cons and they know their content and they wish they weren't cuts. So I call out to all eat cunts gay shit together as cheers. Okay, all you bitches, I have a couple of whiskeys. Hug it out. Go run around the block, get a yoga class and every now and again, open up your chakras. Okay? Open up your heart. Realize you don't have to be a fucking asshole. This is not going to last. And you're caught up in a big trap. And that big trap is you're trying to collect all the gold and it doesn't matter body, it doesn't matter.

Speaker 4:          02:09:13       You could have half the gold and twice the friends. You'd be three times as happy. Boom. That's Joe Rogan experience mathematics for you. At least we found out the real true ending of the Sopranos today, man. Fuck James. For folks who don't know, James Gandolfini died today. I was in New York two months ago with my whole family where eating in a restaurant and a James Gandolfini walked right by and I was like, Holy Shit. You know what? Uh, what makes me sad about James Gandolfini die is the same thing that made me happy about you when you came in today and told me you were stopped smoking, that you haven't been smoking. Right. This is Joey Diaz. I see Joey Diaz and I see James Gandolfini and I say, okay, that's going to happen Joey and I see you and I think you're not going to live forever if you live the way you live and smoking cigarettes. And Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:10:01       the reason why I was quitting smoking as it, cause I tried to hike the other day. I was like, Holy Shit, my cardio is fucked up. So I'm thinking about what, what do you think I should do? I'm either thinking about doing this, uh, this girl that was on fear factor with Yoshi. Uh, she teaches boxing. She's an MMA boxing trainer. Uh, and she wants me, she wants me to train with her hair. I'll tell you in a second. Hold on. She wants me to train with her. Do you think boxing training?

Speaker 4:          02:10:26       Yeah, it's good. It's great. It's really hard. It works. Your cardio. Well, Louis C K does a lot of that. Yeah, it's great. And you don't have to actually somebody, right? You just hit the bag and hit pads and most important thing is it's, it's actually fun to do. It does. It's not like you know, it's not getting on an elliptical machine is sometimes it's really fucking boring. It's not competitive at all. So there Carrie Williams, show me a picture of her. You should do yoga also. I've gotten really into that. Yoga is fantastic. And Yoga. Bryan, you will meet Wu Wei more hot chicks. That girl, you know her. She was okay. I wouldn't know her like that. All Naked and oiled up and shit together. Oh Wow. I barely remember. This is the problem. I was so much prettier than I've really gotten weird looking starting to fade.

Speaker 4:          02:11:15       You don't look Italian anymore. You look more Buddhists again. I'm fat man. My fucking face is fat. People like your face is fat. I'm like, yeah, no, everything's fatter. It's harder to keep weight off when I'm not doing Jujitsu, but my back is better than it's ever been before. For the folks who asked me, but what I talked about, what I've been doing is something called prolozone therapy. It's prolotherapy with ozone for my disc issue and a lot of stretching and spinal decompression. I can't, I can't tell you how much better I feel than just a few months ago. So if you got any back issues, don't be sleeping on that shit. Uh, but so you're going to do boxing with her? Well, I don't know. She offered to to train me and stuff like that, but I don't know. She probably want some publicity. We'll give her some, she was on fear factor.

Speaker 4:          02:11:59       I don't know. I definitely don't hate her. You know, I taught saw too many God damn people. We did, I don't know how many fucking episode, the fear factor, I think it was 148 over six years. And then each person has at least each episode, at least six people. So unfortunately there's no way I can remember 600 people. That's that Dunbar's number. You only get 150 that you could store inside your brain. It's not wild to think about. Yeah. I wonder how that rotates out if they're in number. Yeah. I wonder if you, when you meet somebody new, somebody else's popping out of your brand, that's what it is. Yeah. Your, your, your memory just gets deleted. Whereas people that live in small towns, like, do you ever talk to somebody that grew up in the same town and see what it didn't leave and they know all the same people and they remember everything that happened in high school and they start telling you some shit that you did and you're like, I did that.

Speaker 4:          02:12:43       And they remember things you don't remember. You used to date Debbie Wilson and you're like, fuck, I forgot about Debbie Wilson. How the fuck do you know what, Remember Debbie Wilson? Why? Because they don't have as much information hitting them on a regular basis as you do. David Seaman, former congressional candidate, bad motherfucker on the Internet. Your podcast is what sir? It is the David Seaman and are available on iTunes. Yeah. Itunes and stitcher. And if people want to see a positive side of me, uh, like two interviews ago, I interviewed terrorists styles. Who was Deepak Chopra's yoga instructor. So that's like interviewing mark Zuckerberg, like social media experts. It's fucking dope. That's fun. Yeah. And what did, uh, what did Tara have to say? Oh she gave me some hangover cure tips and like being tired tips, different poses you can try real and uh, yeah. So uh, do you park has like a yoga instructor?

Speaker 4:          02:13:31       It takes care of him or where he goes? Uh, I don't think he takes her, she has a studio in New York, so I don't think that she's like, does he live in New York? He lives in La. He lived somewhere out here. And uh, so how the fuck is he getting yoga from her? Like skyping in apparently a couple of years ago, she talks about it on the episode a couple of years ago. He just came up to her and was like, do you want to be my yoga instructor was showing know someone else. Sweet. Sweet. I think they created an iPhone app together and all that stuff, but I'm just super into it cause it's had an impact on my life. She's not my instructor. I just interviewed her but uh, yogas legit. It is, I do a lot of breathing exercises and calms your mind so much. Yeah, it's huge for you.

Speaker 4:          02:14:10       That's um, there's a lot of shit that people figured out before. They didn't have phones and nothing else to do. So like how do we optimize this body by doing all these stretches and they figured it out and they wrote it down and you can learn from it. It seems like it's nonsense. Like how can stretching actually make me feel better but it does some weird shit. It opens up paths in your brain. Like I remember I was super nervous. I've been a super nervous a bunch of times in my life and the best things that I've ever done to calm myself down was yoga. I was super nervous the first time I ever did the Howard stern show the night before. Good News, sleep. So I just did yoga in my hotel room and that helps when I was high as fuck. I did yoga for like two hours and I just got, hi, I've just hit, this is total complete calm zone where the neck, it carried me over the next day.

Speaker 4:          02:14:54       I didn't worry about anything. I mean I was still a little bit nervous when I got there because he was like a radio hero for me. But once I got in there I was, it was smooth. I was so calm. I was so like I felt I was me. I was 100% May. Well I was worried about that. And uh, the other time, uh, I had like a really important set that I was doing in Aspen at the Aspen comedy festival and I was nervous about it and, uh, I remember this has to do with it was there that I thought was really fucking annoying. And um, when I did the yoga like I got, and this is like total, like complete accepting, calm, friendly place. And I saw the dude that I think is annoying and normally I'd be like, oh, look at this fucking Douche bag.

Speaker 4:          02:15:33       Like this guy's gross. But I immediately, I was like, poor fella. Yeah. Like it didn't bother me at all. I just like it did in my, I didn't mind. I would've given him a hug. If you asked for one, like I didn't care, I'd hit some some frequency where I realized that it was manipulatable. It was you could, you could alter it. You could alter it with discipline. You could alter it with consciousness by consciousness on me and he wu consciousness. I mean by deciding yourself like I would rather be happy than sad. I would rather be friendly than distant. I would rather be warm than cold. So just do it. Go through the work and these hoses. It takes two to tango. It like if somebody is being an asshole to you after you've taken a yoga class, you're much slower to react. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:16:20       You realize that it's not actually a confrontation until you confront them as well. Totally. I ran into some crazy fucking New York. I was in New York and there was guy at the park when we were filming the shed of the park and I thought the guy said something so I said, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Like did you say something? I thought, I thought he said something. I wasn't being mean all he goes, he goes, I know you ain't fucking talking to me. Oh. And, and a, and I go, I thought, uh, I thought you said something. And he goes, I know you ain't fucking talking to me. And I go, well, I am talking to you obviously, but I didn't, uh, you know, I didn't mean to disturb you. I go, I thought you had said something. And he goes, but you ain't fucking talking to me.

Speaker 4:          02:16:59       I go, I thought I was, I go, my apologies. He goes, all right, apology accepted. And they were like ended, but it was like, I didn't engage at all. Like, instead of like, man, fuck you dickhead, right, the fuck are you, you know, instead of that, instead of like, I'll smack you, it was like, oh, okay. You know, whatever, like, and how many times does that happen where that guy wound up getting stabbed or beat up or sent to the hospital or beat somebody else up or, you know, distracting himself from his fucking miserable, pathetic, crazy life. Because you know, he manages to get himself involved in some sort of a conflict. That was exciting. Even just taking a pause after something like that happens like uh, um, I think more about stuff now I do yoga and normally I'm really quick to react. Like I always have some kind of quick response and in a situation like that now I'll think like, do I even have to talk about this?

Speaker 4:          02:17:47       Do I even have to respond to this crazy person or is it better to just laugh and keep walking down the sidewalk? Well, you know, Dave Aspery talked about that on the pockets were just talking about road rage and he were talking about crazy to think about, well what he was saying was, and this is the first time I ever, ever Hindi had anybody explain it like this was that when you are driving, you're going very fast and when you're going fast you have to be able to make split second decisions. So you get locked into this very pure reptile state of mind, which just about move, react, do this. And when someone does something like, fuck you, it just comes out. And the reason why it comes out, it's cause you're ramped up to react without thinking. Whereas if you're walking casually, like down a nice trail in the woods and someone's coming in the opposite direction, there would be no road rage.

Speaker 4:          02:18:35       They'd be like, Hey, what's up? How you doing? And it would be gone. You would do, you'd move out of each other's way. We used to be locked into this reptilian frame of mind. I never really thought about it that way. Our brains, our brains are not designed to go 70 miles an hour. Absolutely trust me out is that when, you know, when you go on any flight, you have a guy sitting in the front of the plane, he's making you know, whatever, like 35 or $45,000 a year. And he's sitting there and he's had to train himself to move at 500 miles an hour and keep that shit together for you for the duration of the flight. When his, his, uh, you know, nervous system is designed to deal with him going at a Max of like 12 miles an hour and he's doing this and it's like neatly routine cause that's, it's crazy.

Speaker 4:          02:19:20       And you paid almost nothing for it. You know, you paid like $100 for the flood. Yeah. Would you ever watch something and play tennis like at a high level seem darting back and forth trying to swat. That's fucking crazy ball. This guy reminds me of the matrix because they're almost anticipating where it's going to be. You have to, cause they're starting to lunch before it's even gone over the net. Yeah. You have to see some physical language, the way their foot turns. You have to anticipate and then people will fake people out. Like in football, I loved the, I don't, my favorite thing. And football's when someone fakes somebody out and then spins around and gets away from them. You know, it's like the escape is even more fascinating than the hits because it's like that you gotta be able to anticipate which way someone's moving and that's, that's fast for people.

Speaker 4:          02:20:00       But that ain't shit compared to cars. When you're in a fucking car and you're flying down the highway like you're on reptile 10 you're on this, you're, you're in this weird frequency. And that's why people wind up talking to, cause they were all tents and freaked out. You're not supposed to go that fast. That's also why we have an issue with news. Cause you're not supposed to get all the news. Okay, you're supposed to get the shit that applies to your life and that's supposed to get everything that's happening with 7 billion people. And it's supposed to be interactive, not just you sit in front of a screen and they tell you all this stuff and you just take it at face value versus a couple thousand years ago you're in front of a fire, you know the campfire and the guy who came back from the neighboring tribe tells you what's going on.

Speaker 4:          02:20:42       And then a discussion ensues where you kind of fleshed out how credible is what this guy is saying. How credible is this? What does it mean for us? And now we're seeing that reemerge. You know, social media, it's a conversation, stuff like this as a conversation. And so it's no longer you're looking at a screen and you have to take everything Erin Burnett is saying at face value. You don't, you know, or any of these people, Piers Morgan, uh, who were just shouting at the screen and in the year 2013, they think that still works. And you can tell it's a broken model. And those conversations pale in comparison to the conversations that you will see with those people on the Internet. Anybody that's a guest on Pierce Morgan, if they came on your show, you would have an hour plus two hours, whatever the fuck you would have with them, they will, you would have a way more of an understanding of who they really are coming off for your show than you ever would.

Speaker 4:          02:21:29       And these seven minute chunks of conversation sandwiched in between commercial breaks and, and, and buttons where they like, Whoa, we're wrap this up. You know, like I, uh, the first time I did your show I was pretty squirrely because I'm used to doing, you know, like four or five minute TV or radio segments, but they're like, art, we're having you on to talk about Nda, just lay it out for us. And it's like, it's impossible to lay out the whole history and how it got to that point in four minutes. So you're just trying to boil down a couple of good points, get it out there in a way that people will think about and hopefully Google the fucking shit on their own, but you can't possibly dive in. And then you get on a show like this, like, oh, I actually can just be myself. You can do yourself and your no to yourself for a long period of time. And I think that's, uh, that's what people are looking forward today. They're, they're, they're looking for, they're looking for reality. They have access to reality at in 99% of the places they look where

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       they don't get it. Is politics the view of the world? Yeah. Media is media. Yeah. But everywhere else, usually looking at people really cutting people's heads off. Look, there's the video. Mexican drug lord cuts his girlfriend's head off. Yup. There it is. I got eaten by a hip out yet I'm watching him get eaten. Yup, he's dead. Oh, look at that. That guy can't run as fast as the tiger. What a shocker. Yeah. I mean, you're getting that reality over and over and over and over again, and it's harder and harder to take the spoon fed bullshit when the Internet provides you with reality in 99% of the instances.

Speaker 5:          02:22:57       Well, in the 70s journalism was about you'd want to appear to be unbiased because that was acquainted with professionalism for some reason, so we ended up being in Vietnam for far longer than we could have been because all of these guys there, they didn't want to insult their audience by giving them their opinions like, oh, it's actually, this is fucked up for us to have Americans coming back in body bags for some more that we don't need to be involved, and they would never say that on the evening news. Instead. They would just be very clinical about it. But sometimes you need people who've done the research and then come out and say, this is why this is a big deal. This is why you should be upset or this is why you shouldn't care. But they didn't do that at all. If the height of you know, network journalism and then until very recently you've seen that creep into everything.

Speaker 5:          02:23:39       Like people who even work at really big blogs, you see they lose some of their voice because they're like, it's not my, not my position to tell you what to think, but really it is. It's your you, it's my position to tell you what I think and why I think that. And then you can come along for the ride or you can go another direction. But to not do that I think is really dishonest. And you read the New York Times, which is on your tablet, on your iPad. So it's competing with all this new stuff. It's better. And they're still, they have this weird like shine of objectivity. So like they can't just tell you what they actually think. It has to be Mr. Obama is paying up to $100 million for his vacation and there's no notation like we disagree with this. It's just here's what's happening

Speaker 1:          02:24:18       as a figurehead. It doesn't work anymore. As a, as a label is a, you know, box that you put all your stuff into. It doesn't work anymore.
