We didn't figure this out 10 years ago, but come on. That's a great, that's a great Rancho. De I'm wasting your time. Gave me the talk to you. We're talking to you. I'm talking to you right now. Welcome to me about what? It's a business. What the fuck do you want? Nobody knows. Prison is a business and that's what it is. It's a fucking business guys. It's important. When a guy like Jillette greatly, I said, boy, you break the fucking law. You go to jail. You sell weed against the law in 2010 bales, you get caught. You go to jail. I went to jail. I'm responsible. I learned how to fucking. That's it. What are you going to do?

Speaker 1:          00:42          There's a law. You cannot fucking do it. You're going to go to jail. Jail and prison are a fucking business. They're a business. That's why you didn't get a ticket driving with the phone. How much they tell you this. How much they tell you this, I don't know. $25 until you go down to La County and it's $225 because you've got to pay the court costs, the prison fee, the judges vacation. It's a, it's a fucking business guys. They're going to raise the taxes now for fucking parking tickets. It's a business. What the fuck you want me to do? This is the oldest conversation. The book, they should have legalized this after they shot Kennedy. They didn't. We fucking fortunate that we live in California and we don't have to abide by this. When was the last time you were at a stone? They kicked the door down.

Stop scaring these fucking white kids and getting them talking. This is nonsense. This is nonsense talk. They should currently with Ya. I never drink it. So what? So who gives a fuck? It applies for everything going. There's a lot of people who are in jail. They get out every day and a DNA or whatever. You break the law. You sell five pounds a week, you got to go to jail. It's a business. You didn't do nothing wrong, but it's a business. They have guidelines. If you get caught with dirty 28 grams of blow, you have to do a certain amount of fucking time. You get caught with a quarter ounce of weed. You have to do a certain amount of time.

Speaker 1:          02:06          You got caught with it. Why are you crying to me for you got caught when I was a criminal for 30 years. You some you get caught with blow. We eat or blow. No, you follow me. There's a way to do it and there's a way, not Tyler fucker. You're going to get caught with fucking weed and not think you're going to go to jail. If you live in fucking Ohio and in fucking Kentucky or wherever you're going to go to jail. I kind of see your point, but I also see his, cause it's a, it's an important man. It's brilliant though. It's important. It's not together with Fallon and the presence hip or what? I don't give a fuck dog. You don't care if I'm smoking. Look, look here. This is what I think about your whole drug thing.

I like when I go to a place and I say, you all, you have wings and they say cubs are ranch. I get up and leave even if I don't get the wings. Because if you're going to serve wings ranch, I don't want to do business with you. I want to do business with you. I'm very easy. I'm very fucking easy. So if you fuck up pork fried rice, what do we got to talk about? Wings must be done with Gucci.
