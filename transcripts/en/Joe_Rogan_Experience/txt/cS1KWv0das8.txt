Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Do Do, do, do, and four, three to spillover fell out. What's going on? See Ya. Good to see you too. Thank you very much for taking me up on that flight. I'm gonna. Tell you what legitimately you changed the way I think about La. It's really small, isn't it? It's way smaller than you think. It's a different thing when you fly over it. You Go, oh, this ain't that big. Yeah, that's here. This is the cause what it is. I remember when I was still getting my license and I was doing a night flight. Right? Which is insane. Totally different ballgame. Imagine. And uh,

Speaker 2:          00:00:36       yeah, because when you're on the ground you're like, wow, it'd be really easy to see everybody because you're looking up and all you've seen is the backdrop of the dark sky. Right? Right. But when you get up there, if someone's below you, they disappeared into the city. So that's what. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So anyway, so we were flying back and I trained down in Long Beach, so we were going along the seven, 10 and I just see like all these, these lights and it was like, right? Them like going up and I go, what's that? He goes, I got a pilot over. He goes, oh, that's the uh, that's the fireworks from Disneyland. And I was like, fucking Disneyland is right there because in my head it took like two hours to get there, hour and a half going down the five. But it's just like, because you don't look at miles, all you do is look at time when you're out here because there's so much traffic. But it's literally like, oh, that's like 40 miles. It's not even. It's like from Hollywood, like I would think it can even be more than 15, 20 miles away. Like Anaheim. He's so fucking close. But I just, it's just like Irvine Comedy Club, that's all I think of it. Just fucking way to fuck down there. And then you get up in a helicopter and you're like there and like 11 minutes going like this. This is ridiculous. So, um,

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       yeah, yeah, that's awesome dude. It was awesome. Yeah, it was a Malibu when you landed on top of that little hill there with a picnic table. Dude sat it down. Nice. I was a little nervous. I'm like, all right, don't, don't fuck this up with joe here because he's going to be like Ed Burger. No, it's all right. When he was flying, when he was the big part when you went to land, he wasn't that good, but I was smooth and then the apocalypse now. Shit, we're going through the canyons. John. That was awesome man. That was so I get it. That was a fun. It's a uh, it's a lot of fun in the, you know, I fly mostly with an instructor because I got the kit and everything, but every once in a while you got to go out by yourself just so you know, you can do it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:24       But um, I also, um, I'm actually over to overdue to do it, but I always go out and I do like the auto rotations and he'll just sort of chat on flying along. He'll just chop throttle and like, it's just, it's just rolling the Rpms. I mean rolling the engine down at the Rpm, the engine down and then you immediately have to pick a spot, you know, when sometimes you know, the lower you are, you know, it becomes literally what you, the first place you look is where you're putting it. It's really crazy. But um, where you would, where you would point what you're talking about. You mean crash landing, that's an auto rotation means it'd be basically if you had some sort of failure problem, your engine failure, whatever. So like when you're flying along in

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       the engine's working, it's drawing air into the disc and that's what creates lift. But when, uh, when you go into an auto rotation, um, it's, it's the air rushing. You're using gravity, bringing the, uh, the helicopter down, using that air, like almost like a fan to keep it going. So, and there's a critical point where if you let the main rotor go too slow, that's why the low rpm horn comes on, which is just a nausea and sound. If you let it go too low, that when it gets to a point where if it's spinning too slowly, no matter how fast you drop, you can't get it going again, fast enough to create and you're basically at that point, you're in something that's no longer able to fly your, uh, your instructor, skylar, skylar a pointed out something that I didn't know that they have to Redo those things.

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       Like every x amount of miles, they rebuild every hours. Yeah, yeah. It's a, well, they have like, there's all this maintenance along the way. They're incredibly maintained because I'm sure you noticed if you read the comments, all people talk about is dying and aviation. It's like, oh, that's how entertainers die. It's like, no, it isn't. They overdose. If you really looked at the graph there on the ground, completely safe overdose car accidents always overdose ranking. Yeah. And Shit like that. And it's just like, that's mainly how you die. Like the amount of people that are up there every day and then nothing happens. It's, it's, you know, but there is the, you know, the, the fly in the ointment is that this, there are particularly at the private level, there are knuckleheads out there like this. People like I think every time I get in I'm always thinking like, am I gonna you know, I don't want to die today.

Speaker 2:          00:04:39       So I, I, I go over all of the, a whole bunch of shit and you know, especially if I'm going to fly solo, I have the whole flight, I have all my options on, you know, where I could land, you know, if I had a problem, like that's what you're supposed to do. I look at weather reports, I do all of that shit. And what happens is guys get more and more confident and their preflight is a kind of look, oh, it looks pretty clear. And then they go out there and uh, you know, this, you know, this, this, there's people who go up knowing that they can die. And then there's other people out there who just like magnum Pi and they want to fly by waterfalls and shit. I mean those guys have more fun. But it's, you know, there's definitely, um, those are the people that you're supposed to fly.

Speaker 2:          00:05:24       There's like two envelopes. You supposed to fly within the envelope of what you're flying and then you know, your skill set so you don't fly into shit this like, you know, like if, if it's too windy or whatever, I'm just saying I'm not going. Even if I could handle it, it's like I'm not going to have fun up there fucking, you know, riding it out and just, you know, let the wind do what it wants to do and don't fight it. And you know, make sure, you know, you're not flying to fail. You do is slow down, you know. Um, but you know, it's there, there are elements of that. But like if you look up there versus what's going on down below when fly, I always say this, when you drive on the highway, it's like you're flying in formation, you're in the blue angels with a Bun with nobody talking to anybody.

Speaker 2:          00:06:04       You have no idea what anybody's going to do. People are texting, they're on medication, they're fucking hung over their suicidal. What the fuck they're doing, you know, and then the Saturday you've got to look out for the guy splitting lanes and the motorcycles and shit. It's pretty amazing how few accidents are actually are there. It is, it is. And what I fly the Robinson, they get a bad rep saying they're not safe because they look at the amount of crashes that they've had. But it, it's, it's because it's a helicopter you can afford. So it's inherently a low our pilot and if you look at it, it's, most of the time it's not, it's not the, the helicopter, it's the, it's the person flying it, which is why you really have to be on it like you, you can't. Um, it's, it's just not something, uh, uh, uh, I don't know how to explain it.

Speaker 2:          00:06:51       It's this weird thing where your level of enjoyment is way higher if you're, if you're riding in it, you know what I mean? If you're the person flying the whole time, you have your life and other people's lives enhance so that you're not really, oh, look at that. Oh, look at that. I'll get that. Yeah. So like, you know, thinking things of like, you know, when we were flying through that Canyon Unit, you've done that. I think in that shit. I'm looking, you know, no one where the wires are and where the road is because that's all fucking tree. So it's going to be the road. So there's those, you know, when you're kind of going around a bend, you know, this certain altitudes and stuff just it's, it's boring, but it's just stuff that you're always thinking that um, you know, I imagine like when you fight this, that, you know, I know with a lot of it's like instinct and stuff, but this, these things that you just don't.

Speaker 2:          00:07:35       Do you know what I mean? I don't know anything about finding. I was her in boxing. You don't lead with an upper cut that just, it's just fucking things you don't think you see. A lot of guys when they go to take off, they do this fucking thing. Like the nose down attitude. Like I was taught not to do that because they do that because it looks cool. I don't know why they do it. I mean, you're supposed to, like I was taught, you're supposed to keep it level so that way if you have a problem, you know, you, you're already in the right attitude to just immediately enter, enter an auto. Like now if I'm fucking nose down and from too far to the ground, I'm just gonna fucking go right into the ground. Um, I dunno, but I mean I'm still like totally a novice.

Speaker 2:          00:08:11       I'm coming up on 200 hours so I don't know a lot, but I'm super, super, super, super fucking cautious. And uh, I, I make sure I don't go too long without doing auto rotations. I used to hate them and now I actually really liked them. Um, it was sort of the way it was explained to me. I didn't get it until one day. I just thought about it and then I got it and I was able to lock into it because it's, it's the same inputs if you were going in for a landing, but they broke it down to like four steps. Like it was low Rpm, you know, lower, collective, gentle aft cyclic, you know, a look at your trim strings, you know? Yeah. Was a trim, trim, airspeed, Rpms, and just fucking doing all of this. And the reality is, is just like it's the right pedal.

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       Jesus Christ, I forgot that right pedal. So it's all the same. It's all the same input if you were going in for a landing. So all I do, anytime I hear the low rpm is I just do that and then I'm locked into it and then I'm just watching my. Then I can just watch my rpms. And at this point I've flown enough where I kind of know where I'm in trim, which basically means you're not like crabbing and you kind of go and straight and then he can kind of like pick out your spot and then it becomes fun. And what's cool is you can do like one 80 autos. You can turn around. And what I do like about it is when you come down to the ground and you can bleed off all of your airspeed, that forward motion that's going to fucking kill you.

Speaker 2:          00:09:30       And as long as you don't fuck up and flare and go back up and then drop like a, you know, you know, it's Kinda like a hockey stop was the way it was described to me. Just level it out and running shoe going to drop. You pull like that. And these guys land. I'm like daisies and stuff. It's, it's really amazing. I'm not as good as that. But like I, I will do it where, you know, worst case scenario, you know, I might like, oh fuck, like get a little bit of a bump. Yeah. But I'm going to be all right. So, um, yeah, I don't know. Now there's probably a bunch of people saying I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, which admittedly, you know, I still think there's a lot of shit I need to learn about standup. So as long as you go into things like that,

Speaker 3:          00:10:04       um, you know, well, the fact that you're doing it and the fact that you learn in a new thing that's really difficult to learn, don't you think that that's good for your brain?

Speaker 2:          00:10:14       Now I am a big believer in constantly learning. It's why I like you as a person cause you're constantly, like you're not the Joe I knew three years ago in a good way. You're like, you learn all of this. You know, I first met you. You weren't hunting, uh, you were a marsh. That was the, you a two dimensional, you will, which was amazing because everyone was just a community. You will this taekwondo champion, a stand up guy. And then, and then since then you've added all like the guests that you have on and the fact that you're able to like talk to them and stuff is because you've continued to, you know, um, you know, it's, it's the same thing with like a comic who writes his first hour and then just sits on it for like eight years and all of a sudden two presidents goes by and it's like, why aren't they laughing anymore? It's like because you're just stuck in time. So, um, I, I, yeah, I believe in that. I also believe in

Speaker 3:          00:11:05       cards, card games and stuff is good for your end in any games they say in video games, you know, people like the shit on video games, but they say video games have a positive cognitive effect on kids. Yeah. That's calculating and move it. You're thinking fast. Yeah, they're hand eye coordination is like insane. I guess if some of those games, if you play them, I guess, I don't know. Well you think about the amount of hours they're putting into their thumbs. Just how often do you really use your thumb and like detailed ways. Very rarely, but kids didn't have ridiculous thumb dexterity. I tapped out a grand theft auto three is when I stopped, which was about 2003, 2002 or something. I just, they were just too amazing. And ours just like, like

Speaker 2:          00:11:47       I am nowhere in my career right now. And this is just dude. I was walking around was living in New York at the time and I would playing the game and I would be walking down the street thinking about it like what? I walked into the subway, you know, like not thinking about jokes, thinking how I could beat this next level. I remember I played this, um, metal of honor game and uh, they had this thing when you hit the sniper button, like the scope would go like that and x would go like that. And I, and I played at one day or one week so much that when I walked out on the street, I was looking at people cross the street to unlike that at x on my face. I was just like something about like, I already, uh, I'm not the brightest guy. You know, when it comes to like school and shit, so it's just like I was like, this is doing something to my brain, so I kind of, I remember I came home and I just unplugged everything but really quickly took everything off because I knew I was never going to figure it out and I didn't have any instructions anymore. I just stuck it in the back of the like, well that's it.

Speaker 4:          00:12:42       I did the same thing with video games with quake. I, I had a real problem when I was playing eight hours a day, 10 hours a day sometimes I had a t one line installed in my house just so I could play with a faster Internet connection. This is like 1998. Yeah, it was crazy. I mean there was slow Internet where I was so I said, well what's the options? And so one option is they chew up the street and put this fucking crazy fat business line. Cost me a shit load of money. And I was like, let's do it out of fucking business line that we use at the time you'd use for a large building. And I had it just for my house and I would play video games online all the time. And you can play online against people for the last 20 years.

Speaker 4:          00:13:24       Oh yeah. I didn't know that. We play online teams. We'd have teams of guys like me and three of my friends would play against four other guys and we'd meet at a certain server and you know, you could chat and talk to each other. All right, you ready to go? Alright, let's go. And three, two, one go. And then the game will start and then we have these matches. And it was fun, man. It was really fun. It was really exciting too because it's all happening in real time. But uh, I reached a point, uh, somewhere around like the year 2000 where I know one day I played until it was sunlight until the sun came up. And you know, I'm fucking 30 years old and I'm sitting there. My hands are sweating. I'm all fucking caffeinated up. I've been drinking a mountain dew for the past eight hours.

Speaker 4:          00:14:10       And I realized, I'm like, what am I doing like this, you know, I'm not where I want to be as a comic, I'm not where I want to be with my life. And uh, I'm just sitting here playing video games all the time and there's no future in this. I've been stuck in things where there's no future before I know what that is. I felt like that with fighting, I was when I was 21, there was a point in time where I was like, there's no future in this. Like I'm just going to keep getting hit in the head and I'm going to get dumber and more brain damage and more crazy. And I'm like, this is dangerous. And I realized I'm, I gotta stop. I gotta stop. There's no future in this. There was no money in fighting back then either. And then I got there with pool. Same thing with pool. Like my manager called me up and he said, I think you play pool too much.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       He's like, he's like, I think that you seriously think about pool more than you do your career. And uh, I respect him and he's a very good friend of mine, so I had a really, really poor. I didn't, you know, I didn't take it lightly. I had to take a deep breath and I was like, fuck. He's right. He's right. I played pool all the time. It was playing every day. I have a, I have a real addictive personnel too. I do too. So I get like a, like how many hours I want to get flying and then like a things I want to learn, playing drums and stuff and then it becomes, I, I've had to learn to be like built. These are hobbies. Yes, yes. Dad First. And you're a comedian. Let's sort of priority. Like the world isn't waiting for you to know how to play good times, bad times. That can sit back a little bit. But the fact that you're doing that kind of stuff I think is great. I love it. I really identify with you and a lot of ways when you do that well you get fucking crazy about drums. Are you going crazy bro? Everything. I just.

Speaker 2:          00:15:51       Can I just, I go down, like I got to learn all about, like everything came out here. I got into old cars and then all of a sudden I was watching this guy, Eric, the car guy. I found him most fascinating because he would work on like cars of today. Will you just open the hood? It's like what is everything and where the hotter you get it and he's just taken off all this plastic shit and just dig in all the way down and he's just like, you know, if you can't remember just video tape it. Just remember how it all goes together. Dude. One time I forget what the hell he was changing, but he had to take the whole front end of this car off to change something that I used to be able to change on, like my fucking 83 Ford Ranger.

Speaker 3:          00:16:28       I know that guy. I know what you're talking about. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:16:31       It's in, it's like he does every electrical. He doesn't fucking everything and I would just sit there. I watched all of that. I watched all the way back to people rebuilding like Flathead v eight s and what made it a flathead and I never got any electrical that always seemed like magic to me. Like I never got into that shit. I was scared like, Oh, you touch it and you get fucking electrocuted. But I got all into like watching like, like somebody rebuild an engine, like just from the bottom to the top. And that just wasn't a lot of stuff, right? It was like the crank shaft and then there was the shit that held on the Pistons. You put the drop to Pistons in and that the. Then there was the intake, the intake manifold and then the other was the um, uh, the big thing, the valves gapping the valves that seemed like our man, if you fuck that up, this thing isn't going to run right.

Speaker 2:          00:17:19       And um, and just knowing that the firing thing. And I got into like Torque wrenches and I learned how to change brakes on like a, a, like old school, like shoe breaks and stuff like that. I got all the right wrenches and all that. Um, I don't know how to adjust them. I know where you do this, this little slit in the back of the wheel and I thought you just put them close to it. It's right up against the drum. You supposed to put them on. And I got totally into fucking breaks for awhile. I tried to rebuild the carburetor, failed miserably because it was really old and I took off too parts. It was like warped and shit. So was that your dodge? The truck now? Ford. Ford, yeah. Ford a black. It's black. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. The thing was brown. I don't know what years.

Speaker 2:          00:17:59       Alex. 60, 68. It was made. I looked up the vin number. It was actually made in Canada. Crazy. March of [inaudible]. Sixty eight, I want to say Toronto or something like that. Like they, I guess they had a, a, a factory up there or whatever. So in March of 19, 68, that thing rolled off and I think it spent most of its life down south, like in Georgia. And you swap the breaks off or dyspraxia? I did a, I, Chris Titus was the one who helped me with that. Uh, he put a, I did one side, he did the other, he did the other, but he showed me I was just doing what he told me to do, so I had all drum brakes and I wanted to keep it all original, but you know, people were pulling out in front of me like I had disc brakes and I'll tell you what, it's fucking hilarious.

Speaker 2:          00:18:44       When I only had drum breaks, I locked him up one time in front of a bunch of millennials and they've never heard that sound fucking. And they all, they all went like that. And all I was doing, I just, you know, the light turned yellow fast. Yellow lights are out here. I was kind of an east coast mindset like I can make this. No, I can't. And I just fucking. I didn't even think I hit him that hard. I kind of went a little sideways and then it was fucking hilarious. It's like this outdoor cafe and they all looked over and then I just had to fucking sit there. It was almost like that already lang movie, when he fucking moon, he moves the crowd and the guy gets out and just leaves him there. He's like, oh, he was. He was supposed to keep going. That's what I felt like I was actually embarrassed. I'd probably waved and said sorry.

Speaker 4:          00:19:24       Those breaks are terrible. It's amazing. Nobody died or more people didn't die. Rather those bricks are used to have a 1970 barracuda that, those kinds of breaks. Oh yeah. No, just was 71 when I was in high school and you'd hit the brakes and it would just skid. I mean, there was everything locked up inside lock breaks. One of the greatest inventions. Ms. fucking incredible invention.

Speaker 2:          00:19:47       No, I used to drive my truck before I had power steering. I've got put power steering in an air conditioning. It was just basically a farm truck and it was like no power steering three on the column, which I still have because I think that's cool. And I used, I got stuck in the teeth of the one night, like the fucking, uh, you know, traffic always say it stuck driving through the teeth of it. It'd be like between five and seven, I was coming from Santa Monica driving over to the fucking laugh factory. And I literally, by the time I got to the laugh factory, I was tired. Man. I know I'm an older guy, but just like shifting and like, you know, like when you, when you're at a dead stop and you just turning the fucking wave of that and it's this giant steering wheel to give you like leverage. That's why the fucking thing is so big. And I was just like, oh my God, like I, you know, do an, a three point turn in that like my triceps would be burning. Not In the best shape, but I'm just saying it's like I got to make my life a little easier. My little

Speaker 4:          00:20:42       car, that little red car that I have that doesn't have any power steering. And when I, when I turned thing, that car is so light and tiny, it's fucking hard to turn though. Like when I have to pull into the parking lot at the comedy store and I have to back it up so that I could get out of there quick. Yeah. It's a pain in the Dick. Three point turns are not three point turns. So like four or five points.

Speaker 2:          00:21:00       Yeah. I wonder if back in the day, because those, those original cars, they had those little skinny bike tires on it. It was, it was just easier to turn in as they got like heavier and wider.

Speaker 4:          00:21:11       Well, you know, my corvette has that modern suspension on it, that 65 corvette and it has really wide tires, like the big old steam rollers. Just for a goof. I had the power steering taken off. I'm like, let's see what it's like to have the power steering. It's fucking horrible. It was horrible. You'd get a forum workout just driving around

Speaker 2:          00:21:28       driving on the street. Yeah. You're bouncing around. It was too much

Speaker 4:          00:21:30       and change it back. Yeah. I love old cars though. There's something about the idea that you could fix it. You could go in there and with a good book or a good video, you can actually fix it, you know, I know a lot of guys will fix things. I know guys who have changed their transmission, they've gone in there and swap their transmission now for a new one

Speaker 2:          00:21:50       balls to take it apart. And then the patient's like, I know you gotta ask for help. And like I just found like it was just like, and like, ah, I need what tool? I don't have that fucking tool. Then you have to order it. It was really frustrating. And um, that was a quick sort of like rabbit hole I went down. So I like, now that I kind of understand how the whole thing comes together. Um, but like, yeah, I guess that gets back to the whole, uh, going down the rabbit hole,

Speaker 4:          00:22:18       there's a guy who's got a great video that you would love and it's on petrolicious and it's the video called, I think it's called a car, one car for everything. And is this guy, he's a fiction writer, writes screenplays and shit. Never worked on a car in his life. Decided you want to buy an old porsche, so he bought like a 1971 porsche and didn't know Jack Shit about cars, so he starts learning one called car to do it all. That's it. So this guy puts together this car and then starts working on it and then takes his fucking garage and turns his garage until like a professional workspace, digs a hole in the ground, puts a lift in, in the floor of his garage, like blaze cement does everything. This guy married A. I don't know, it doesn't seem like it doesn't seem like. But he's got that old car. This is the car. A beautiful car. Look at that thing. I'd love those. Oh and that's, you know, my

Speaker 2:          00:23:22       71, it looks like in 19, late seventies to me.

Speaker 4:          00:23:25       No, it's a flat. No flat hood. The long hood rather. The long hood models are like 68, 67, 68 to [inaudible] 73. That's the name Jack Olson. It's a really fucking cool video because this is a guy that didn't have any background in it. That's his fucking garage. He built all this. He built the whole garage and he decided, look, I just slowly get into it and understand it and he has different Arrow, like see that giant wing that's Arrow that he puts on only when he's at the race track so we can unbolt it and do it. He uses his car for everything. He uses his car to go get groceries.

Speaker 4:          00:24:01       That looks like fucking beautiful car. Those cars are so light to that car. Cars like 2010. He flared out the fenders though, right? No, no. The RSR from that era had flared fenders. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Well they had to have fat rear fenders and fat rear tires because the engine's in the back and those things snap around when you take in turns because the balance is way off. Like the engine is hanging out behind the rear wheels. It's not a mid engine car. It's a rear engine car, which is extremely rare, like only porsche really does it and so you get something called lift, throttle, oversteer. When you're in a turn, you have to keep the pedal on. You have to keep the gas going. When you're in a turn, if you let off the turn, your rear end just pops out and you get oversteer you'll spin around in a circle.

Speaker 4:          00:24:52       So they used to call the turbos widow makers because the way they used to have those old cars, they used to have those really shitty tires like that. Like he's got new modern compound tires on that thing, so it probably sticks like glue, but the old tires were dog shit. They were terrible. So you'd have this super powerful engine, the weird dynamics where the engine's hanging out behind the axle. I never thought about that. Yeah. So much fun to drive. There's so much fun to drive. So engaging. I love taking it to the store because by the time I get to the store, like my brain's firing, it's like pop in because I've been shifted and it's all mechanical. It's air cooled, you know, and it's not a very. Like that red car is not a very fast car. Like a modern car. Like a tesla is way faster than it is, but it's what it is, is a lie. It's like you feel the gears, like when you shifted, put that sucker in a second. It's very visceral, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:51       I drove a buddy's tesla one time. That was fucking ridiculous. It fast. Yeah. No, my head was Tanglin, like I said, blood rushing to the back and he just had the one motor and every guy I know that has a tesla, the handful, a handful I should say. Uh, they all got invited to the factory when they got the motor on the front wheel and the back wheel and all of them said no to that car going, dude, I would fucking die if I got that. It was like almost like super bike motorcycle fast. Like a, like a, like a racing motorcycle level fast. It's zero to 60 in like two point something seconds. And then they have that new one, that roadster that's coming out. That's one point. Something seconds. One point something seconds. Zero to 60. Yeah. You're, you're in a missile. I, it's the only way to put it.

Speaker 1:          00:26:37       Like God forbid somebody's foot slips off the brake onto the gas. You're going to obliterate a street full of people and that's fucking crazy. It is crazy. It's bad enough. Somebody does that on a bike. You can do that on a car with all that weight and those tassels. I heavy as shit because of that battery, I guess. Which I didn't really. I think I would think because there was no power train or anything that it would be lighter, but I guess that is like super heavy shit and they don't make any noise, which is even weirder. So they're coming at you. You don't even know. Yeah, they're kind of lost and I don't know. I don't like the front end. There's no grilling. The front end's boring. It is kind of boring. Kind of boring. Like the new one isn't the roadster roadster that pull up the.

Speaker 1:          00:27:14       Can I promote that? That roadster. Can I promote the portrays thing? Fuck you. Uh, what, what do we to February 19th. The. What would this look at? This eighth annual Tesla's new emissions testing mode will produce loud nasty farts on demand. It makes fart. Added a fart app this week. Oh, that's so ridiculous. It's got seven different parts or six different fart sounds, and then one automatic. You can set it to like different buttons, turn signal, and so it makes sounds and it makes smell to no smell. It's just the sound emissions. Oh, okay. Okay. That's just stupid. Anyways, to patrice o'neal Fart. When is the February 19th at the New York City Center. And uh, what do we got here? I shut off my damn phone. We got um, Michelle Wolf. Michelle Wolf. Jim Gaffigan. Uh, I got it here. Had I already forget. I'm SIFA sounds myself. Rich Vos. It's all coming back here.

Speaker 1:          00:28:09       Big J. Big Jay Oakerson. Gary Goldman. Chris read a. that's a fucking hell of a line. We're going to try to add a couple more people to it. It's at the New York City Center. Tuesday, February 19th. Uh, all proceeds go to his family and it's been such a great thing like his, um, his mom's been able to get a condo and everything just total because he was taking. We basically with that thing we take care of everybody that he was taking care of. [inaudible] believe the mission was basically all his family should have to deal with is the grief Brent, you know, I always think that that's enough. And the reason why we continue to do whatever year is because his family members are still, you know, alive. And I always hated that when somebody died and says, hey, we do one time, it was a sack of money trying to make this last for the next 30 to 60 years of our lives, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:28:56       And uh, and then also because, you know, he was the best standup that I ever saw live. And uh, just keeping his name, you know, I always think that when, anytime somebody says, oh, you're one of the top blah blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I always think, well, you know, if Patrice and Hedberg and all of these fucking guys do Freddy Soda, what he would've done. Just thinking about Freddy, I was just thinking about that when you said that, that maybe we should do one of those for Freddy's family. Yeah. Freddie was like, he was a brilliant. Oh, when he was, where he would imitate his dad and shit. Cardless. Oh No, it was like, it was like, yeah, he would like hurt the crowd. It was like, he was like, oh my God. Stop. Stop fucking guy too. Yeah, he was. Every time you saw Freddy Soto is all about hugs. Oh, there's a good dude. I last time, last time I saw him, we

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       were working in a number, the aspen comedy festival. Yeah. I remember that. And I didn't see him the last couple of years. Maybe I saw him out in la, but that was the time that I remembered because we were kind of in the same group,

Speaker 4:          00:29:52       Group B, Group A or whatever. So, uh, yeah, he was walking around, I think it was buying something for his wife or his kid or something like that. I, I, that one. Jesus, you know, you heard so many out of all of them. He was when I was just like Freddie, Freddie died. I couldn't believe the sleep apnea. Apparently sleep apnea and pills to go to sleep, you know, take ambien. If you have sleep apnea, you lock up and you just stopped breathing. Sleep apnea is a real fucking problem. I have it, I took a mouthpiece mouthpiece in at night when I go to sleep, but it keeps my tongue from falling back on my throat. A lot of athletes have it. The bigger your neck gets, the more muscle tissue you have in your neck, the more closes off your air hole. When you go to sleep, like there's a lot of meat in there, most stuff filling the night shift and dude, what do you do when you got to get a barbell and just tied to the side of your fucking head effective working out. You just get a big no one can straggle you. That is what it is for real like, well, someone could definitely still strangle you, but it helps a lot. Like if you get ahold of a regular neck. Regular. Next, just comply.

Speaker 2:          00:31:00       Please call your next special regular neck. I guarantee no one's going to try and accidentally take that

Speaker 4:          00:31:08       title. Regular neck, regular neck, Joe Rogan, regular neck. It's hard coming up with a good name for a special. Are you? Somebody told me you were doing. Are we saying that you're going to do your next one? Independent, you're going to do it independent?

Speaker 2:          00:31:21       No, I don't know how I'm going to do it. I'm, I'm exploring all the options and all of that. I'm, I'm trying. I was trying to figure out a way to uh, you know, because it's just a ton of specials out there. We're just trying to figure out a way. But I mean, you know, when was the last time you filmed a October? Twenty 16. So, um, do, um, do. Um, but it's like, am I do? I Dunno. I Dunno. Like I don't, I don't. Uh, it's, it's what it is. Is the special has changed since you and I started. Yeah, a special was special. Now what it is, is it's just kind of an on hour long advertisement letting people know that you're still out there and it's like this just doesn't have documents your stuff though. Yeah, it does, it does it. But there's just such a sheer amount of stuff to see to have like an impact the way like I was trying to think maybe the last one that really was just like whoa.

Speaker 2:          00:32:17       And I would say it would be like maybe Dave chappelle killing them softly. Certainly Chris rock bring the pain where it was just like, you know, I'm not saying there weren't ones that like, like people talked about, but like just that thing where like, do you remember when we were kids it was just like, you know, Friday, Hey man, see you on Monday. And then somehow on Monday everybody saw or everybody saw dice or everybody saw Sam kinison on, on the, um, the, uh, the dangerfield thing. And it was just like no one was talking about it. And then just like, there was only so many channels and that thing just caught enough people's eyes and you came to school Monday and everyone was just talking about it. Like, um, you know, I'm, I'm still getting fucking tweets from people saying, Hey, I finally got around to watching, breaking bad, you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:33:09       Or like I was talking about the wire one time, they were like, dude, you, you could've said, spoiler alert. It's like that fucking went off the air in like 2006. Like, how much time do I have to give you to watch it, you know. So, um, I still haven't seen the water due. My Buddy, his uh, his son, the number one thing that he, he, he watches. Is he on his phone? He's watching one of these guys that gets paid to play video games. He watches this guy on his phone play video games. Everybody does that. Okay. So yes. So now that's another thing to watch exact. Forget about online porn and fucking me watching Eric, the car guy and all that. Trying to, trying to like find like where you can like drop the pamphlets of your career basically to be like, hey man, I'm still around. I think

Speaker 4:          00:34:00       there's definitely more content now than ever before, but for, in terms of the amount of standup that's available, there's never been more great standup available to watch. Yeah. Like think about how many specials there are now. I mean, it's fun. It's fucking crazy. It really is.

Speaker 2:          00:34:15       It is. Um, it's, yeah. So they're not really specials. They're not specialists. They're not specialists because because it used to be specialist used to be the top comics, now arguably it was basically the top white male comics. So the fact that they fixed that is a great thing. But now

Speaker 4:          00:34:33       though, I mean Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, Damon Wayans, there was a lot, there was a lot of white guys. There was a lot of white guys with a lot of great black guys too. Really the real problem was women. There wasn't very many women. Like women are like

Speaker 2:          00:34:47       three stations. There's Apaches, there's other people out there doing standup specials. There's got to be anyways. But what I'm saying was, but it was the best, the best, where now it's just everybody. It's everybody, right? So, like I remember when I remember when it was changing when I was doing a club and uh, the feature act was complaining that he didn't get a half hour special on one of these networks. And I'm thinking like your feature act and like, what are you, what are you going to, you're going to do your whole act and you're still a feature and you want to document that. And it's just like they used to give out half hour specials when I started out and it was to like guys who had been on the road for like 15 years and they will pick it up from there, headlining our, uh, they will take half of that, like the best bits from an and then you know. And that's somehow through time just became a feature going up and doing his whole act.

Speaker 4:          00:35:43       Well, Netflix is doing that now. They have the degenerate special. They have a big J did one. Joey Diaz did one. Christina Palicki did one. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:35:52       I'm not saying it's bad, I'm just saying it's changed, right? So because it's, it's even changed since my last special that I put out my last advertisement that I put out a hour long advertising. Um, so you just try to figure out, because everything's just fucking changing so fast. You just trying to navigate like where can I put this in all of this, right? That it's going to blink enough that someone's going to stare at it. And maybe like, watch the thing. I just noticed you fucking lights with the sky. That's pretty critical, right? Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:36:23       She was the company that makes those octo lights. Shout out to octo lights. Gavigan did an interesting thing. He decided not to put his newest one on Netflix. He puts it on everything. It's on Hulu and Amazon. You can get it on itunes but not netflix. Yeah, he's a smart guy. Well he just took a chance, I guess, you know, just decided to see what happens if you just make it available everywhere instead. Yeah, I'd like to talk to him, see how successful that was.

Speaker 2:          00:36:52       Yeah. I love because I'm still working out my straight. I'll talk to you off air because I don't want because it fucks with my ability to make something happen. So I'll, I'll tell you what my idea was, but that got nixed.

Speaker 4:          00:37:07       I've thought about doing it and just put it right on youtube. I've thought about doing that before was not getting paid for it. Just shoving it right on youtube. Just see what happens. Yeah. And Youtube. Yeah. Yeah. Just paying for it and just sticking it out there because if it is an advertisement, what's the best way to get it out there? Well, the best way would just be to put it on youtube and then to segment it into like little chunks so that people can digest it in. People wind up doing that. I don't think netflix takes them down. I think when you have a bits up that like from specials that, that go up on Netflix, I think Netflix just let them stay up. It

Speaker 2:          00:37:43       just depends on what your, uh, what your contract is because you can work that in. We did a special with Paul all things comedy network. We did a special with him which was, did phenomenal, like broke all their online streaming. Uh, um, records and it was great because he was a guy that they don't really give special. Right. Right. Now, you know, who did he do the special for? Comedy Central. Oh, uh, so the streaming version was really successful. Yeah. I mean he, he did well on well now trying to get people to actually just fucking sit down and watch television. Like everybody tape you tape shit, right? That's just how it works, which is now if you watch like NFL Games, they have this thing now where the game's going on and all of a sudden the game slides to the left and then there's two boxes and the advertising boxes bigger because they know everybody's taping games and they're blowing through it and advertisers somehow can tell if someone fast forwarded through and then that they, the nfl doesn't make as much money.

Speaker 2:          00:38:44       So now they're, they're running like this is where they take these two things. So you don't really have to look at the commercial, you can just sit there looking at the game, but then they're telling you about fucking whatever at the same time. Yeah, it's weird. That's gross. It's gross, but isn't. I mean that's how I make money off advertising. It's like my thing, what, what's gross is, is how your uh, what, you know, if you're dumping shit in the water supply, if you got like all kinds of like, you know, I mean I think they all have some sort of labor fucking issues.

Speaker 4:          00:39:14       I would like that still. I would like to be able to pay to not have that. Like if I could Amazon one click, I'm like, how much I got to give you for each game? Well, don't have to see that. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:39:24       but they'll give you. But what the advertiser will do is their pockets are deeper and they're going, they're going to go. They're going to find like. What's funny is when the Internet started out, all of a sudden you went from watching seeing all these commercials to like nothing to now seeing way more than you ever saw. Yeah. Like my, the worst is when you watch an hour long youtube video and then all of a sudden it just stops and you know, they try to make, make a nice break and then you just watched this and it annoys me. But I'm like, well, I do advertise on my podcast. How upset about this can I get?

Speaker 4:          00:39:55       Um, you know, I don't know. When you see, when you look at the line and you see those little yellow lines on the youtube video, we know that's where the fucking ads are going to pop up. No, I didn't know that. Isn't that how it works? Yeah. Yeah. I mean look, advertising is what it is. I mean it's either that or you do like a Patriot type deal when you have people contribute like Sam Harris does that, right? It doesn't,

Speaker 2:          00:40:22       you know, there's a million ways to do it, but like I don't get mad at advertising because like I said, a standup specials me advertising, then I'm going to be out on the road.

Speaker 4:          00:40:28       You say that, but it's not, it's entertainment. It's people that watch it. They can enjoy it. Like thinking about it

Speaker 2:          00:40:35       that there's a way also to do advertising entertainment like way back. Those less filling tastes. Great Bud Light Miller lite commercials were fucking funny. They were great and you wanted to see them and you love them or at least I did. So yeah, there's ways, there's ways to do everything. They still have some,

Speaker 4:          00:40:51       some good commercials. Like what's that insurance lady who's always in those commercials. What does that flow flow? She's, she's fucking funny. This funny commercial still, but it's, you know, it's hard. I know Seinfeld was actually thinking about opening up an insurance agency at one point in time because he apparently likes writing, stuff like that and he was literally thinking of an advertising agency. When I say insurance advertising, he was thinking about doing that at one point in time. Yeah, but making ads that he was probably like, wait a minute. I don't want to have a real job. It was like, how much money do I need? Time guys like that make me feel normal with like car collecting. Like when I went to Jay Leno's place, he's got 11 buildings filled with cars. I'm like, oh, okay.

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       I see where this goes. Yes, I got to give my son. He has a. He is, I've never been over there, but he has, he has enough cars to start his own traffic jam on the. He could fill up the four or five one side of it. I would think he could fill up the Pasadena rose bowl. He can fill up the fucking parking lot. It's ridiculous. I'll take you. You want to go? Yeah. But does he have been your truck? Does he have more? Uh, uh, cars then days of the year. Oh yeah. Because I know he also has like motorcycles. He said he's got that. That's another one. That's another one. I went down the rabbit hole is a. was it Jay's garage? Yeah. Yeah. Great show. Oh yeah, I loved it. No, I, I, yeah, I got into all the gas monkey garage.

Speaker 2:          00:42:15       Jay's garage getting that gas monkey gun on the show. Oh, Richard Rawlings. Yeah. I just got an email yesterday. He asked me, that guy's a love guy's a fucking right. I love that guy. Ask him about my favorite episode, my favorite fucking episode of that because he always, like, I watched that show so much. I knew the number was going to come at. They'd be like, okay, what do you want for this gun? And he always get them to say it first and then you're like, ah. I mean I was, I was thinking like a five grand and then he'd be, oh, five now man, I can't. I mean, I mean I, I could do, I could do like $2,700. Right? And then the fucking guy would then go down to four grand and he would come up like, like 300 bucks and he didn't ever get in the car for like three grand, like whatever the fuck you want it.

Speaker 2:          00:43:01       Right. So one time he went out and he busted this guy down on like a, a, an old trans am or a firebird. Assam Shit. I forget what the guy sells it to him for like fucking, he wanted like 18 grand or something. He sold it to him for like 11. So he fucking gets the car over there. He's talking about he's going to do about with it and all of a sudden the guy's brother calls up and says, Hey, that guy didn't have the fucking right to sell that car. That's also mine. You got to, you know, I'm going to come down and go, I got to buy it back from you. So the guy comes down and he's, you know, asked him what he wants for it in Richard's just. I mean I was thinking like 20. And the guy goes, he goes, dude, you bought it from my brother.

Speaker 2:          00:43:41       I know what you paid for it. He actually got embarrassed. He's like, Oh man, that's the only time I ever saw him get like embarrassed. He wasn't, he just went into like his, his thing and like, I swear to God, like watching that show, like you get better at negotiating and like, uh, and like occasionally he does like these sketches to where he, he'll do like a character imitating like an old school used car salesman and you just how good he does it. Cause you know, it's like he's a performer or an act or anything. How good he does. It's like this guy is like, this is just in his blood. He's just been a car guy. He's been flipping cars. I'm trying to, I'm seeing the show in a minute. But like he used to talk about how he uh, uh, you know, by the time he was 19 he was on his 30th car or something. Like, he was just like, I like that car, I'm gonna buy this car. Like that one. And even just every month would just flip them. Those cars.

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       There's something about those shows that if those an auction shows or anytime, like a pawn shop shows that something about wanting to know how the deal plays out, you know, that is so compelling for people. There's something like, and I'm a moron, I'll just sit there staring like, how much are they going to get? How much they're going to get for that? Yeah. Who that civil war coins, what are those worth

Speaker 2:          00:44:55       and how much they busted down and just like, yeah, that Guy Richard is probably the best I've seen. He's the most entertaining because he's like a fun guy to watch. It's a performance. Yeah. He's like, ah man, I man. I was thinking, Oh man, I don't know. Yeah. And then he goes up there and he pulls out this giant Wad. It's like, dude, you had it, you had the money. They look. I asked to sit there and watch it. Then he kind of makes fun of him afterwards, you know, we can kinda make like a funny way or whatever. But um,

Speaker 4:          00:45:23       it's a funny thing to that how appealing that is to men. Like I bet if you looked at the number of women who watch those car shows versus the number of motor trend has a channel now they have their own channel and I guarantee you that 97 percent dudes and three percent women complaining three percent women going, what the fuck are you watching? Like if you looked at the actual numbers, like what is it about cars? Like girls can drive cars, girls drive cars all the time. Girls liked cars. They don't like cars with guys like cars. It just. Most of them. Generally speaking. Yeah. Outside of like Danica Patrick and few psychos. Yeah, I met her one time. I saw a picture with you. She did. She took me around the Indianapolis Motor speedway

Speaker 2:          00:46:06       coming down that straight away and seeing like you know, where they have the leaderboard and everything was iconic and I've been to that race a couple of times so it was crazy fast. Were you going. She ended up, she only went like half the speed of what the car, how fast they would be going to somebody, and we got up to maybe like 1:40, but we were like going around turns and like my face is doing this, but what I loved about her was she had like a test pilot vibe. Yeah. Like she came up and was just vice, like, handshake and shit. Beast. Yeah. It was pretty. Uh, you guys are. Yeah. She was just totally like, a little different than her sunglasses in my sunglasses. I definitely, I've passenger sunglasses. You know what he's talking about? They look the same. No, no, no. Those are like right off the fucking shelf. What's wrong with your sunglasses? Verse Hers, like you'll see it. I tell him the details. Come on man. That's like me. I probably, you know, your crescent kick probably looks the same as fucking some guy. A strip mall to me

Speaker 4:          00:47:03       literacy's a crescent as one of the rarest kicks anybody ever pulls off. It's leftover from the eighties, whatever. Um, but that's kind of legit. Crossing kicks, kind of legit. I thing about Mika is after awhile it just all becomes like shelby toxins. Yeah. And Hammy, Hammy Kudo. We get a Hemi cuda coming up and plum crazy. Those fucking things are too much. Do you buy those things for a million dollars? And when the car came out was like 20 grand. I mean not even,

Speaker 1:          00:47:31       but I like, I like weird shit. I like, you know, I want to get a 76 GMC rv. That's what I want to go on the road with. And then they had, this thing was, I think it was called Palm Palm, desert green or something like that. It was like this total Ron Burgundy. If you click on the interior and that thing was way ahead of it's time, it's time. It's amazing. Look at that fucking piece of shit. That's not a piece of shit. That's fucking tremendous swivel. Oh my God. Tell take something. You walk off stage and get on that fucking thing. You feel like a king. You got a driver. What do you give a fuck? You don't give a fuck about anything. I can be on the road forever and that just making eggs on that little stove top. Now you're in there drinking. You're doing what you want. You watching goodfellas or fucking anchorman.

Speaker 4:          00:48:24       That is pretty beautiful. It's so. Well it's an experience to your riding that thing. That's a retro experience as not just a truck.

Speaker 1:          00:48:32       Yeah. That thing I, you know, my wife Nixed it. What are you going to put her in the fucking drive and we'll keep it. I don't need it. She was right. My wife's always. Not always, but mostly women don't like when you collect shit, like where are you going to put that? They don't like that. You get too many things. I have the reason why I got this place collection here. Oh yeah. Nobody could say nothing. The spot on says nothing. No, but then it becomes. You spend more time down there. Then you don't though. I got it. I got it nailed. I figured it out. Get up early. You're being such a jerk. That's why they don't have a point. I don't. I actually, I can actually refute your opinion, your point or whatever. It's so universal too. All we would have that response like, the fuck is wrong with you, and they. We had a highway. That's it.

Speaker 4:          00:49:27       Well, imagine being them watching you imagine being a woman have taken care of your children. You know, you give birth. You had this little tiny infant and then financially you're relying on this fucking maniac, so they're flying helicopters and fixing cars. I know playing drums all day. He's like, what are you? As long as the money keeps coming in, they can't say anything, but they're like, what the fuck are you doing?

Speaker 1:          00:49:49       The end of the day, you married an eight year old, wouldn't marry a comedian. Oh, Jesus Christ. Yeah. You're lucky. We're not drug addicts. Yeah, yeah. No, I'm, I'm, I gotta. I gotta work on myself, man. I got fucking, you know, I, I just, I am a difficult person to live with. Evidently. I didn't realize it, but like I'm now looking at it honestly stepping back and look. I go, yeah, I can see that. I can fucking see that. I've thought about it. I'm definitely difficult, but if you don't think about it, that reminds you about it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:50:26       Imagine relying on me. I mean I'm reliable. Like I want to be responsible. If you, you could have married the me that worked in a fucking warehouse, that I would have been the same thing, you know, and we would be in a studio apartment. Here's the deal though.

Speaker 2:          00:50:41       One that married yet they would've found someone better. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:50:46       yeah, yeah. If you were just fucking off, never got your shit together, you know what it's about. Limit to is their ability to move on. Yeah. Like I've, I've always said like if I have a fucking died, how quickly all my clothes will be at down at the goodwill, you know, and she'd just be like, you know, sell the house that's just burned some sage. That was interesting. Alright, well next step to the plate. All my discussions with biologists and people who study like w what's Gad, sadly, what is his discipline? Behavioral Psychology. But he studies Gad said, is that his last name? It's his fullness. A D, g, a d. that's his first name. Gad S A, a d is his last name. Is it? Does it rhyme? Does it also Ronnie's Canadian evolutionary behavioral scientist. Brilliant guy. He was so in Lebanon. Does his name still rhyme? That's a good question. Is there anywhere he can know me? My name is. Gad said. Now he calls himself the Godfather. He's great. Oh, so he just steered into it. He's a great guy. I can imagine these 13 but brilliant.

Speaker 2:          00:51:52       I last talked to you about why would you name me

Speaker 3:          00:51:57       Gad? Sad. I don't think sad means the same thing over there. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:52:01       different language. The end of the day it rhymes. There's no country you can be on. You can be on that fucking little island with a shot. That guy with the arrows and they get they're gonna. Make Fun of. You should probably kick you off the island can. You can't name. You see some of these celebrities. Some of the fucking names. They named their kids. It's just like, don't you remember school? But you don't remember how fucking mean kids were. Why are you giving the plate? Painting a fucking by getting your creative. Yeah. Have a meditation room. Fucking don't do that with the name. Oh, give them a nice bill name. William. This is folding chair Johnson.

Speaker 3:          00:52:38       People need to express themselves. They do it through the naming of their tools. Children.

Speaker 2:          00:52:42       My other favorite thing that what they do is when they fucking, they put their political agenda on them like the kid doesn't even have a fucking chance. Like this whole thing, like gender roles. They bs by the way that my little experience being a dad, going to kid birthday parties, they. Those kids are not old enough for that behavior to be learned through. The kids come. The boys show up. It is fucking brave heart. They come over the fucking hill. The girls are social. They're sitting there. That kind of that taking things in in our kids. Boys come in, they fucking dude. We were at one on Saturday and there was this. This kid was hilarious. He looked like A. Bobby Hurley is a point guard, right, and he was playing this game. He had like this ball and he was using his. His, his forums is a bat and he was hitting it.

Speaker 2:          00:53:33       Then you would catch it, then he would throw it between his legs. He was doing all this other kid hand eye coordination was great for his age, so over in the corner where I was sitting with my daughter was these little like sort of like cushions that someone had put together like three piece thing and made it into like a little chair for. So an old person like me could sit down. So I stood up because I was worried that ball was going to hit, so it's kind of guarding that. So he went over and got the ball at one point and just seeing the chair there, you know, all built like that. He just saw it and just kicked it, just destroyed it. And then continued on. I was thinking like, why did he do that? Because he's a boy. He's a boy. Yeah. We like ruined shit.

Speaker 4:          00:54:07       Well you got a lot of energy. Little kids like need something to do that's physical. The little bodies have the little little batteries overflowing with energy.

Speaker 2:          00:54:18       That shit was all about like grabbing, throwing, breaking, breaking. Yeah. Do you remember being a kid? Yeah, I already did that. This whole thing of like, like, well women aren't aggressive like that because you know, a slow standards. Yeah, I think it's, they're aggressive in la. I think that they, they literally from like just survival shit. They are looking at like, all right, that's what I have to compete with. And there are, you see them looking at the boys who appear to be dominating and what they are is they're actually showing all of their carts and the little girls are already taken and in breaking them down knowing, well I can't get physical with this person. I can't like dominate this person physically. This is definitely. And they just immediately stuck on, like that's why they're fucking smarter than real, I think. No, did I lose you somewhere in there? I don't necessarily think they're smarter

Speaker 4:          00:55:15       going on is that uh, men have different DNA in the genes or aggressive

Speaker 2:          00:55:22       men are to be doing reckless shit. Right. That's, I'm just saying it's nice to run society didn't sit down and watch three cereal commercials and then be like, oh, I need to be fucking this. I just think that's, that's just some bullshit that adults come came up with and judge

Speaker 4:          00:55:42       as adults, it's almost always women. It's women that think that there's something wrong with the way men are raising their sons. They think there's something that like this idea of these men raising these kids and these kids being aggressive is because of the way they're being coached. That's not true. It's just that's just a part of being a boy. This is a shit ton of studies of people wanted to actually look at the science. I mean if you leave boys alone with toys and girls along with toys, boys will gravitate towards trucks and fucking, you know, things that they can hit and smash and girl sit down there with little teacups and they play with dogs. It's natural. Just a 100 percent natural. There was a documentary on babies. You know what they. Bees are gender neutral, raising their kids

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       gender neutral, so they don't call them a boy or a girl. And my thing with that is there's no way. You're not saying to your son, you're sure you don't want to wear the dress. And then the kid wants to fucking have wants to parents' approval. Yeah, I didn't want that football. I guess I wanted the dress and it's just like, like I said, you know, my kids barely two. So what the fuck do I know? I'm just saying my limited experience at kids' birthday parties is not even how it was ever even questioned that. Like they're too fucking too young. The fucking year and a half, two years old. Like you're telling me that society has, they have, it's ridiculous. But it's, it's usually women that want to push this. And men who are pitches. It's like these, these men that don't like, they don't like aggressive man.

Speaker 2:          00:57:17       They don't like manly men. And so they, they push it as well. It's not because they're aggressive and they're controlling and they want to run shit. And that's because that's the thing where like if you really look at their agenda when they say the future is feminine that's not inclusive and they're. And they're all about, I'll make this more inclusive. It's like, no, let us in so we can take it over and then we'll push you down. Is is the psychology of the kind of person that goes after that? Someone that's after like power. I'm not saying the average woman is like that. My wife is a feminist and she's intellect inclusive shit, but like people who are spearheading stuff like those people are wired the same way. Like you know, I mean a dominator is. Yes, yes. And there's gonna be no room for you.

Speaker 2:          00:58:00       It's gonna be like think the way, like a lot of that that's so called progressives. Extreme left is think the way we think. Save what we say. Oh, we will fucking destroy you. Pull up that tweet that I retweeted today. The David Pakman retweet. David Pacman's is liberal progressive guy. This woman posts on twitter, she would never vote for a man or a white, a white man or white person, white male. Why? Someone is white or male. He says that's racist and sexist. It is. So she blocks them on twitter today. She called Boston College demanding that they not have him back as adjunct faculty. It's crazy. So this woman post this and he points out that it's racist and sexist, so she blocks them and she tries to get him fired. Okay, this is why that whole thing is fucked up. Okay. Because he's acting like white people exist on an even plane, which is, which a lot of people try to do.

Speaker 2:          00:58:59       So it's like he's not necessarily he just saying that what she's saying is racist and sexist because she's determining which is going to vote for based on tire on the race. But there's other elements involved like the level of that white people. Not saying all white people, but white people have fucked over people who are not white. Forget about poor white people who they fucked over. So you understand that. But they're both. Right? But then like the fact that she then takes it to the point that because he had the audacity to have a difference of an opinion, that that's the thing now in that now we're going to destroy you and you can't be on this thing. And then the other level of that is how the corporate entities are so afraid that one fucking nickel is gonna roll out across all of this shit is just a paper tiger until you get the big behemoth to listen to you and this, all of these, these fucking things from award shows to this bullshit that someone just needs to be like, listen, this guy already apologized.

Speaker 2:          00:59:56       This is, this is an old fucking thing or a look, you just had a difference of opinion that, you know, this isn't the first time you're going to say something and somebody's going to disagree with you. That doesn't mean that this guy can't come back. Um, you know, and you obviously because of some shit that's happened to you have an extreme opinion about this guy because of the color of his skin. It's like there's so many fucked up elements to that that. But for some reason you can't, like if you address that on any level, um, then you're part of the problem.

Speaker 3:          01:00:28       And it's not just part of the problem that she's trying to get him fired. She's trying to get him fired for pointing out that something is racist. I'm saying if you say what I just said,

Speaker 2:          01:00:37       try to look at it three 60. Oh yeah. And as much as I can, which is why I love South Park is everything that they do. They do at three 60. Right. And uh, so I learned a lot from that show by the way. They look at stuff like that because I don't fucking know everything, but even just to try to be like, well, hey, you know, you know, insulted, salted them a little bit. I understand what you're saying and blah blah blah. You can't fucking do that anymore because then something you all part of the fucking problem. And no, it's really good. Crazy crazy. Got to the point like, I've seen like a name names, but I've seen like a tweet from a fellow comic telling comics what jokes you shouldn't talk about this topic. It's like who the fuck are you? Let's say there's already been enough people doing that. You're going to do like cannibalism now.

Speaker 3:          01:01:17       Have you ever seen comics say real comics? Uh, yeah. I mean, everybody has their opinion on somebody fucking act, but I mean, yeah, yeah, that's ridiculous. That's not a real comic. Um, well, I wouldn't say that they are a real comic. They just have an opinion. I don't agree with thinking fuck off. I mean, I mean trying to have less confrontations. I understand in my life here. That kinda shit drives me crazy though. What, what drives me most crazy is this bullying, what she's trying to get him fired. She tried to get him fired for having an opinion on something that she publicly stated. One of these,

Speaker 2:          01:01:56       the, somebody running one of these things has to be like, you know, and it can't just be private. It has to be a public tweet to say that this is, it's just going too far in this fucking thing where you have a difference of an opinion now and they're just gonna, you know, take your fucking job away. You know, I ran into this shit, you know, when, you know, uh, when the, me too stuff first started coming out, people would try to like, you know, you know, you had to tweet the right fucking thing and if, if you said anything sort of, oh it's, let's look at the evidence, God forbid you fucking said that. It just became like this whole part of the problem. Then they would try to take you down or, or, or someone you were, you were friends with or doing a show with a represented by. They would try to do like that pressure to try in. And it was just like, you know, I have to say, I was like, no, I'm not doing that. And then it just goes away because you don't have to fucking leg to stand on

Speaker 4:          01:02:54       people that are doing it. It's a small percentage of

Speaker 2:          01:02:57       unbelievably small, unbelievably small. And the comics, it's like we're literally running for office. We're out there campaigning for this election that never happens. And you're going through red states, blue states, you going through fucking everything. And the general consensus of people is like, like, dude, that was fucking crazy like that. That doesn't make sense, but no one wants to say it because they're going to get steamrolled. And

Speaker 4:          01:03:22       I saw what happened to Matt Damon. Matt Damon said we have to make a differentiation between the Harvey Weinsteins in the world. And then someone who like Aziz Ansari, he goes on a bad date, there's a big difference between those two. And they attacked him and they tried to get them pulled off of that movie. Ocean's eight.

Speaker 2:          01:03:37       Yeah. And they were acting like that, like killing somebody versus stealing a car versus walking like literally the whole judicial system is based on what you did is your punishment. Your parents do that. Right. You know what I mean? You're bad was what you did. Yeah. That's all. That's what that sounded like. That. Yeah, exactly. We live in a world now where I have to be measured in the way that I say that. What he said, you know, affected me how I heard it. And then also this is just a template, gold fucking bald, white male. And they, did they go in that route, it's like you, you literally sound like what the fuck you're against and it's, it's a, it's not gonna last and I feel like it's like the end of the winter and people want to go outside and get some sun on their face. And you didn't like. No, no, like taking people by the back of their fucking neck and fucking shoving their face in the shit that you can't sustain that. No, you can't sustain. It doesn't,

Speaker 4:          01:04:43       it doesn't work. You don't get people to change by yelling at them. It doesn't work.

Speaker 2:          01:04:48       Bombing them like what the fuck we're doing with like, yeah, that's not all you're doing is you're just building up resentment and more people want to fucking take you down. So that's.

Speaker 4:          01:04:57       They don't understand psychology. So what they think is this is their time. This is their time to get back at men is there their time to yell at men, this is the time to where the future is feminine tee shirts. There's a time to take their stand and they will say, did you not see the women's March? I saw a bunch of people walking. Right? Listen, I'm not saying the points that they're making don't need to be made.

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       I'm not saying that their complaints are not just. It's, it's the execution of it. Yes. Where it's like you're going to go through intimidation and destroying people like exactly people's careers and people. You have to publicly

Speaker 2:          01:05:32       apologize. It's so. It's like that's bullying people. Yes. Some of the biggest bullies right now I can't believe it because I'm a lefty are on my side of the fucking fence and you know when someone's on your side of the fence and you'll looking at him like you sound like a fucking crazy person. That's when you've entered.

Speaker 3:          01:05:52       What was your special strange times? Weird. Yeah, like it's like it is strange. It is strange because it's, it's they feel like they're justified because they feel like with the maniac, like trump in the office, that they have to do what they have to do to change the world, but you don't change the world by yelling at people. It doesn't work that way. And there's this real points to be made is real points about. I couldn't imagine being a woman working in an office with a bunch of guys trying to fuck you all the time. It's got to be a goddamn nightmare. I can't imagine having a bunch of bosses that literally tell you, you suck my Dick. I'll give you a race that happens. Yes, fucking. It's got to be hell. I get it. I mean, you got to be like an eight though. Eight on up to deal with that everyday. I mean, let's be fucking honest. You know what I mean? There's really, there's really six is out there that's really good. If you've got a lot, got a nice ass. Just say it. You know, it's just like some of that shit is fucking, you know, it's, it's. I always viewed it like,

Speaker 2:          01:06:55       like you ever watched like the behind the scenes of like a prison in the first thing every guy thinks is like, how the fuck would I not get raped in their exact women have to think that just fucking walking down the street. So that's how I wrap my head around to be like, wow, okay. Like what they're saying is like, because I don't

Speaker 3:          01:07:13       like, like

Speaker 2:          01:07:15       one of the arguments, not like that doesn't make sense. What doesn't make sense to me is the children of the corn torches burning and just go like, um, the way that, I mean a lot of people, they do that with like a, our foreign policy. Like this whole fucking thing is bankrupted this country every August now that just shut down the government which has just become normal and all they do to, to make it like, okay is they just raised the level of debt that we legally can take on or whatever. And it's like, all right, let's do this for another year. And if you question any of that, that means you don't support the troops and you're a fucking piece of shit. You need to get the fuck out of here. And it's like so much stuff doesn't make sense to me. Like I just saw, um, Michelle Obama, they had this fucking tweet of her wearing these glitter thigh high boots and said sets twitter on fire with their $4,000 fucking boots. And it's just like, you know, the top question where she got that money,

Speaker 2:          01:08:24       the president makes 500 grand a year. She blew four grant and thigh high boots and don't even talk to me about the fucking book deal and all of that shit. That fucking guy. His first like to, you know, public speaking engagement, things were like with major banks and you go out on the road, thousands of dollars and all these guys are like, fuck it. All these fellow Americans are upside down in the house from those fucking banker comes who did not get, did not get punished in 2008. They all see me. We'll talk about like people who should have their fucking lives burned down. Those people and these guys that they're in, they have their faces in the same fucking pig trough. It's the guys with the red ties and for whatever reason, like

Speaker 3:          01:09:04       I don't. And I don't know why. Like they get a pass. Exactly. It doesn't make any sense. And then more serious shit. Like drone strikes, more, more innocent. Civilians were killed with drone strikes during Obama's administration. I know. And that's why they're telling me you fighting terrorism, why you're creating more of it, because all I would want to do is just get revenge. Exactly. And uh, you know, I have

Speaker 2:          01:09:27       plastic ways of how to get the fuck out of there. How do you do it? Well, I mean, I'm not saying the air would be cleaner because I don't know what, like when you throw a tesla battery into the fucking ocean, what that does to it. I'm sure it's fucking horrible, but I know that there are a one stop shop over there in the Middle East. They got oil and that's it. You know, I always compare them member that kiosk and like the South Shore Plaza in Boston, that was something, it was a place called wickson sticks. All they did was sell candles,

Speaker 2:          01:09:53       which just seemed like a really vulnerable business or pewter pot first they just sold muffins and then they started doing full breakfast. Well they'd like a pewter pot that just selling muffins. So if we stopped buying muffins and we had enough oil here, if we switch to solar power and all that shit and all the windmills are ugly and I know it's probably just as much fucking bat on the environment, but what it does is it gets you out of there in bankrupts them and then they don't have the money to funnel through the Mos to, to, to fund the terrorists.

Speaker 3:          01:10:22       Well, the United States is exporting oil now, which is crazy. I mean we, we, we have a lot of oil, right? And especially through, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:10:30       I'm just saying. But if you ever suggested that. Yeah. Which I think I just did, I think then for some reason I don't love my country and I'm trying to solve it. I'm a frugal guy, you know, I don't fucking know. I don't spend beyond my means and you know, uh, I don't like debt and that type of shit. I don't know how the fuck these guys. I think that's why the president ages so much, um,

Speaker 3:          01:10:53       well then don't go to sleep. The pressure you imagined, the dead bodies, everything, all of that. A pitch is knowing how everything really works. Oh yeah. Trump doesn't seem to mind. He just takes an extra adderall. Keeps on trucking. He doesn't seem like he's all the scandals. That guy seems completely because I think he, he's, he's a certain sick mentally that it doesn't. It doesn't get. It doesn't get in because he hasn't aged at all. Now granted he's got all that white stuff around his eyes and he, you know, I don't know what he's doing with the hair, but the hair is usually the telltale sign, but I think it's one of the only presidents that, you know, it's like half of that shit's probably from a doll, like who knows where that got enough money to do like a transplant at this point. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:11:39       You can't do a transplant on that thing. It doesn't have any. He doesn't have any donor area. What do you mean he's got it all in the back. That's. No, he doesn't ever see what happens when it flies up in the back. When the wind hits it, the back's all balled. All because he probably did the original plugs and they didn't take. Who knows what he's got going on back there. He's got chaos going on back there. You ever seen it? Yeah. I mean he's the president and his hair flops up, but you ever seen the video of him? It looks like he's a guy wearing a demon. The demon mask. It's very wispy wispy like it's missing. Look like, look like, you know, it'd be nuts if he gets a second term and he shaves his head, that would be nuts and he would just look like the most evil fucking do whatever. Like that would be like if you've got a second term shaves, his head starts doing intermittent fasting, lifting weights gets on steroids, drops down to about a buck 90 jacked. Yeah, I mean that would be.

Speaker 3:          01:12:35       I think yeah, it's definitely A. I don't know. That's why I'm trying to just in my own little fucking world, I'm trying to chill out more and I'm trying not to fucking uh, there's just, there's enough yelling. I don't think that they need it from me now. I think more mocking and laughing than yelling for sure. But when you see enough of those, the future is feminine tee shirts and you see enough hypocrisy and you see enough people trying to take people out for commenting on what's sexist and racist and trying to get people fired. Like it's a time of outreach across the board and you have to respond a little bit. You have to let people know, hey, this is fucking ridiculous. Like there's. There's a certain obligation, especially comedians have as a social commentator. You see some stupid shit if you're not commenting on it, they're skewed.

Speaker 3:          01:13:24       Choose to go that route. Some people just like, I'm just going to let you forget your whole work week and I'm just talking about a bunch of shit. Small stuff, like a Seinfeld type stuff. Yeah, I mean some people don't comment on anything that's controversial. Some people, they'll go their entire career. But what I've always loved about Seinfeld is like if you really listen to him, he has contempt. I said this on the comedians and cars. He has contempt for like 90 percent of the things. This anger underneath this shit. Brian Regan's like that to Brian Reagan used to do that fucking bit about the cattle prod, you know the walk, run a walk stand line on the, on the bucket, the moving sidewalk at the airport. When he would act out the cattle prod that he wanted to fucking do. I was just like, there it is. There it is.

Speaker 3:          01:14:10       He's one of the nicest fucking guys ever. Brian Regan, he is so nice. He's an unbelievable. Just decent a fully formed human being. He really is a great guy. He also knows when to get onstage, when not to get onstage. If he's drunk, you won't get on stage. The other day it was at the store. He was hanging around. I had my show in the main room and I said, Brian, you went to a set. He's like, thank you, but I've had too much to drink. It was in the back bar. Little bit split up and he just said, I just don't think it's a good idea. Especially because he's got that squeaky clean act. If he goes up there, there's fucking conc hey, can't. You just can't. I've only twice in my life I've been on stage drunk once was an Ireland. Oh, that's a good place to be drunk. Yup. And then the uh,

Speaker 2:          01:14:58       that's not doing the kilkenny festival long time ago. And then another time I had gone to a red sox yankees game, got drunk at the game. I thought it was sober and somebody texts me as I got back to the city going, hey, you want to do a spot? You know, I got off the subway one do a spot. It was like, yeah. And I thought I, you know, you know, when you're so drunk that like, just drunk fill sober. And I got on stage and I was just like, oh shit. And I really had to slow down. I was like slurring fucking always gone on people immediately. Everything I've learned as a comedian I was like, I like opened micro energy and the whole crowd reacted that way and I had to kind of slow down and get it going. I don't even think I did my time. I was like fucking sweat and my mouth was dry. It was just like, alright, that's it for me. That was my closing bit. That's it for me.

Speaker 3:          01:15:48       Yeah. So I never did that again. Yeah, it's a, anything that slows your brain down, it's not the best. Yeah. But a little buzz. It doesn't hurt anybody just a little bit. Uh, I don't drink you like one drink. You don't drink. I know you don't like anything? No, I don't actually, I have like a rule that I used to. We used to have like a drink before you go. Never ever. Not even adult drink. Nope. Never. Did I think you did no confusing you with somebody? Maybe so. I know. I'm like, I'm kind of just, I don't know. I was, I drank too much, you know, I was just drink too much and then I just take some time off. So I'm just taking time off from booze and right now I know you got on a big diet kick for awhile. You've got down pretty light.

Speaker 3:          01:16:32       Dania, you go pretty heavy and then you lost a ton of weight and he developed abs again. I got four out of the eight. I got halfway there. Good. I got halfway there and then uh, then I had a six week run on the road and it just fucking sucks, man. I ate perfectly. I wasn't drinking for like two months now, almost three months and then six weeks, six weeks and you just fucking, you know, it's just, it's just, it's just not fair. It's not fair that there's no way in a healthy way to really lose like five pounds a week. But you can easily put on six. No problem. No fucking problem.

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       Especially in like New York. You could just fucking, you could do it. You can lose five pounds a week if you really have the weight to lose. I was going to say like I was going to say 10 because I knew you were going to debate. That sounds rough. 10 tenured dehydrating yourself, but you can lose five. But I mean like not losing muscle mass, like just doing it the right way and you're going to keep it off. I'm not talking about some celebrity crash diet or I gotta make weight for this fight. I mean like, like legit. Just how easy it is. Fucking New York City. He had a couple slices of pizza every fucking night. After a night of drinking, you're of a certain age. That's it. Five pounds.

Speaker 4:          01:17:43       All of a sudden you fucking slacks aren't fit in the way. This boosting. Yeah, I do. You ever do intermittent fasting? You know what that is? Yeah. You ever try that? Yeah. It's called sleeping.

Speaker 1:          01:17:59       I haven't eaten for eight hours. It's supposed to wait 16 breakfast break fast. Now I can do that. That's not. Fasting isn't that hard. It's just the. If you start at four in the afternoon and then you know by the time you wake up the next morning you'd gone so long that you're not even hungry anymore and then you kind of find and it's just that first night and then you're already. I know a buddy of mine does it. He goes, dude, I still work out. I don't do anything. Goes. I have this ridiculous amount of energy and all this shit. And I was just like, I heard when you're fasting, you're not supposed to do that. And he's like, it's all bullshit. It's all bullshit. You heard when you fast, you not supposed to. What exercise? Yeah. Like you're supposed to fucking be chilling. Nah, no, you can exercise. You can definitely are. Especially in a second non doctor to tell me that I could do that. So I'm waiting for someone with at least has a lab coat Halloween costume to tell me that. I'll get dom d'agostino. He's a guy that gets sad. Glad God said.

Speaker 1:          01:18:53       We have a guy that's been on fasting. I'd be like, I'm sorry, just your name. Rhyme. One of Gad is short for something, but God's zoucks. One of the great drummers of all time, Steve Gadd,

Speaker 4:          01:19:04       we'll get zoucks has a great name now. If you name your kids, get zoucks. It's just, it's just not fair to you. And she'll get zoucks is not a bad name. It's Kinda cool. God zoucks. Remember that? People would say that God souks. I was like a comic book type thing. Like when people were stunned, I'd sit say [inaudible]. I would say steep. Yeah. Lebanon. Common male. Arabic name. Given the means a felicity.

Speaker 1:          01:19:34       I know, but do they fucking. If you're last name is sad, do you have to name your Kid Gad? I just can't picture a part of the world. Will you name fucking rhymes and you don't have to deal with that every time I get. Yeah, I get it. It rhymes. Can I have my fucking falafel?

Speaker 4:          01:19:48       You want to talk to him? He'll show. He'll do a show. He's funny guy. You talked to him about that. I don't have smart people on my podcast ever. You've never done it right?

Speaker 1:          01:20:02       I did it once. You did do it once. I make an exception that we did it at place.

Speaker 3:          01:20:09       Okay. Has it been that long? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well we did it. No, we didn't do it at my house. We did it at the studio if I recorded it or something like that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I like how you do a dump. I T, I keep telling comics saying, look, look, Bill does. He doesn't need anybody. He doesn't need anything. He's got a fucking recorder and he just rambles. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. That's because of my childhood, the way you just said that. Anybody has anybody needed anything? He doesn't need anything. Yeah. That's where I went and that was my protective place. I went mentally. He just started talking to yourself. No, I was just like, fuck everybody. I don't need anybody. I don't give a shit. I don't care. Which wasn't true. I did care. I did care. But you just say, I don't care. I don't give a fuck. That's a pretty common thing amongst comics, don't you think? No, I think I'm unique. Oh, interesting. Now I guess it is a few guys that are doing that now. Like you though, like Theo von does his podcast, very similar to the way you do it. He just rambles, you know, uh, Dalea does it. Very similar. Just rambles. But that's a great. It's got to be a great way to develop material. Like, come on, try not to take too much shit from there. Uh,

Speaker 2:          01:21:22       you know, I answer questions and shit. I had my little fucking tent poles. I got to get me through.

Speaker 3:          01:21:26       But uh, I, um,

Speaker 2:          01:21:29       I don't know. I guess it just started out as a way to promote my dates and I would just talk, Hey, what's going on? I'd make a couple of jokes. I'm going to be with the punchline in San Francisco, but blah, blah blah. And it was only like a minute long or two minutes long and then it just got a little long and long. I would tell some stories. I used to call in a service is how I did it and it would record me on the phone. So I had my little flip phone and I will remember those. Yeah, like at an airport and talking on the phone, it was like a phone call and I will be making fun of fat people and Shit. They were walking by. How long were those then? Those started to get to be 10 minutes, 15 and a half hours to the point it was, you know, I, I noticed I was talking on a cell phone, like my head felt like I was getting cooked.

Speaker 3:          01:22:06       Um,

Speaker 2:          01:22:08       and then, you know, and then I started like, oh, I need. Oh, I'll answer questions. And I had to think for a while, overrated. Underrated.

Speaker 3:          01:22:16       Um,

Speaker 2:          01:22:17       then I had a segment, is it racist? But then somebody said tosh point. Oh, had something like that. So I had to get rid of that.

Speaker 3:          01:22:24       Uh, yeah, just kind of did that. Now I just, I dunno, I just sit down sometimes I forget that I'm fucking

Speaker 2:          01:22:31       talking to anybody. Almost all those years had just been on the road just talking to yourself in the car. You talk to yourself on the road and your car. Really? I listened to music. I fucking fantasize about being in the band as a big thing. When I listen, I listen to music when I listen to a music, like you pick any fucking song and I'll tell you who I am in the band during it. Like I know you an hour Smith guy. Right? So try and kept rolling. I'm Joe Perry when he's fucking playing the guitar. And then when Steven sayings, I'm Stephen, I'll do the whole fantasy. I'm just like jumping around like, fucking I'm in Star Trek, right? Uh, and then when Joey Kramer does the fucking, the drum roll in the middle, that I'm joey and uh, yeah, I just crush it. It's just a whole fucking fantasy of me.

Speaker 2:          01:23:18       Have you ever met those guys? I met Tommy Hamilton. Joe Perry did my podcast. He's a great guy. Great guy down to Earth. Yeah. Ridiculous with them. You like forget this is one of the greatest guitarists of all time. Yeah, all the riffs. He wrote a regular dude. Steven Tyler. I'm at one time. Yeah, just all. Yeah. I always like, um, you know, just that whole band experience is very, a lot like standup where in the beginning you're doing these impossible gigs and you get like this, you know, it's like you against them and even like as you came up as an open mic or the band was kind of the, the, the class of open, Mike occurs and you'd go up there and you don't have to crowd got the better you, you'd like if you know, if your buddy told that person to shut the fuck up or whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:24:10       I just liked that whole thing. You know, like when I read that, you know, when those guns and roses books about how their first Gig was in Seattle and they had this van or something in a broke down and they just kept going and they just were thiamine and they just somehow fucking got there at the last second. They just did the Gig. Um, you know, I just, and I also, I just would think it would be, I think it was great feeling as a comedian to turn the room around, but to actually be in a band and fucking, you know, you did it with somebody else. You could actually share it with somebody as opposed to you fucking doing it by yourself. And then going back to the super eight, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:24:45       I love that you do those gigs where you get together early with Dean del Ray and you guys play music and he sings. Dean del Ray can sing his fucking ass off. Dude. He's good. Like, he's really good.

Speaker 2:          01:24:58       God, he has all the fucking rockstar moves and shit. He's fucking. Yeah, we had a great time. Uh, the clips he was showing you that was at the forum and then

Speaker 4:          01:25:08       whole lot of rosy. Yeah. I was like, Holy Shit. Yeah. Like that is, he's got a fucking voice

Speaker 2:          01:25:15       and we didn't tuned down. A lot of times, like when you go see a band you don't really notice, but they tuned down half a step or a full staff and sometimes people can get whey the fuck down on certain songs. But he still, I saw guns, [inaudible] roses recently. Actually. Give me some volume on acts.

Speaker 5:          01:25:46       Here we go. Debit on base. Awesome. Cover might be a little slump,

Speaker 3:          01:26:21       like you're a fun band together, but you've got a legit professional singer.

Speaker 2:          01:26:27       Well, that guy on base plays in whitesnake. That's Mike. Devin. She's a Massachusetts guy now. He's a fucking beast. He's a beast for some reason. Everybody looks like they're playing lefthanded there.

Speaker 4:          01:26:36       I had a girl I did once. It got in a car accident with her. Some old man ran a red light and slammed into us. And uh, I uh, cargo total. So they're taking the car away and I have a box in my cassettes in the car and she sees the white snake cassette and she fucking threw it away. She's like, why are you still listening to this letter? I let it throw it away. She must spend beautiful. She's pretty hot. She was older than me. That's why 1988 chucked my fucking white snake. Checked it out. So sad. And because of that, somebody sent me one. Is this still here? Where is that?

Speaker 3:          01:27:10       Somebody sent me a fucking white snake is set right in your office. Fucking told the story and set. Sit around here somewhere. Someone's Wednesday here, dude. I feel bad. Oh yeah. That was first relationships. The shit you fucking with

Speaker 4:          01:27:27       tolerate. It's amazing. I know, I know. But sometimes a woman. That was the thing. I was still kind of a boy. She was a woman now she was 25 and she's on her own for quite a while. Oh yeah. I remember when I was 23, I dated a 30 year old. That was not a. That was not the way to go. Dave. I think they treated you like a toy.

Speaker 2:          01:27:50       Yeah. And it was like, you know, she had been through a bunch of relationships so she knew how to put up. She knew how to post up in the thing, so I was just like,

Speaker 3:          01:27:58       yeah, he was ready for Ya. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:28:02       it was fun. She was cool and everything, but it was just like, yeah, it didn't work out.

Speaker 4:          01:28:07       Yeah, obviously. Yeah. I felt like I was a dog. Like I was like, I was like, she got a dog.

Speaker 3:          01:28:14       No, no chicks get a German shepherd. No. Yeah, you were a German shepherd psycho. Crazy back then to, this is what I was. I was still fighting, so it was like

Speaker 4:          01:28:27       I was 21 and she was a graduated from college. Grown woman, had a job and a career

Speaker 2:          01:28:35       like cds and she's like, Oh fuck, you know, cassette tapes, cds in the car is in [inaudible] 88. Did they know they did because I remember a buddy of mine ate a buddy of mine. He had the first one. He had a Volkswagen. Sure Aco that we thought was amazing. Right. That was like a sports car and he had, this might've been 89 though. 80 nine or 90? I can't remember. That's kind of a blur back then so long ago. But he had like the uh, they would like mountain, like you had almost like a man. It wasn't like in the dashboard and it would just sit on like the little console in the middle. So then the thing if you went over a bump it would skip. Ah. And then they had like the big suitcase they'd put in your trunk in that way it holds like 18 fucking cds. Ed Changes. Oh, look at this. Is that it? Oh, okay. Dad Discs and 84. Wow. Well we were just out of high school so he didn't have the money. We thought he was rich. He had a Volkswagen Scirocco oh, it's in his car in 1984. Wow. You know they had car phones back in, like the sixties, that phones and cars. Oh yeah. He had to be like the presidential level. Yeah. Super fucking rich guy. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:29:49       I'm surprised you don't have a flip phone. So I would do it. I mean, I don't, but I like, I played my card games of spades and gin rummy and shit like that. Whenever I'm in traffic now if uber or something, that's how I get through traffic and I don't flip out because I just fucking stare at my phone. You don't listen to books on tape or anything like that? No, I can't do that. You can't listen to books on tape. I've never tried. I just can't what would annoy me listening to the person trying to make it sound interesting, you know, with the influx, with the inflections in the voice and stuff because I'm defensive. I like, this guy thinks I'm a fucking moron.

Speaker 2:          01:30:38       And in 18, 62 data that happened that and just talking like that, I'd just be like, all right dude, just fucking read it, read it, read it like a bailiff, dude. I remember, you know, I have that reference because um, when I got busted for drunk driving, the bailiff goes, this is what he said. The good guy goes, pulled the defendant over approximately blah blah blah blah, you know, chasing through two towns, you know, whatever. And uh, which I, which was bullshit, I anyways, I had a fucking 83 Ford ranger and the bailiff read the thing. He said, uh, the arresting officer asked the defendant where he was coming from and he stated fucking Boston. And it was just like, that's not, that's what I said, that's not the way I set it. I was fucking wasted. He, I was trying to remember. He said, where'd you come from? I was like, fuck it, Boston fucking Boston. I didn't want to get out of the car. And I was like, yeah, I wasn't a jerk. But when the guy did the read, right, he goes, we asked him where he's coming from. He said, fucking Boston. And then I looked like a like, oh, it's funny, I was standing there, there's was all these people mug people. And they were like laughing, like, oh, this guy, this guy's sticking it to the man.

Speaker 2:          01:31:59       I got

Speaker 4:          01:31:59       pulled over for drunk driving once, but I wasn't drunk. I dropped my phone, dropped my phone in the highway, reached down and grabbed my phone and I wiggled a little bit right. And I wasn't even reading my phone, this is my phone was a treat my legs and it fell and I thought it was going to get underneath my accelerator and they pulled me over and they made me do all kinds of crazy shit and I did it. I'm like, I'm doing all of it. I'm like, look at me. I'm sober. And then they wanted me to take a breathalyzer. I'm like, okay, why do you want me to take a breathalyzer? Like I don't, I don't want someone to trust your equipment. He just got done doing all the tests. Like, look, I'm doing, I'm on one foot and fucking pounds. What do you need me to do?

Speaker 4:          01:32:37       I can, I can do it. Set up some cones. Like, do you want to know if I'm drunk? I'm not drunk. So why do you want me to blow in your bullshit? Like what's going on here? And the cops, they greeted with me, they let me go, right? I said, look, I'm a big supporter of police officers, big supporter of law enforcement. I donate a do benefits whenever they come up and I'm sober and I'm sober, you know, the best sec. All my most of my friends, we all got busted for drinking and driving. The best one was a buddy of mine. They read his practically four in the morning. We noticed a Maroon VW, Fox blowing its horn, trying to pass on the right. We pulled the defendant over afterwards

Speaker 2:          01:33:18       repeatedly asking the defendant to stay in the car. He got out of the car, threw his keys at my feet and repeatedly stated, lock me up. I'm fucked up. And it was funny was my buddy was a good looking guy and the judge was a, was a woman and when the guy read that, you know, locked me up and fucked up and he wasn't the brightest guy and he just Kinda, when he went, like, he put his head down like that and he was, you know, little pound puppy fucking looking dude. And she, uh, she, she gave him like a lighter sentence because he was good looking. I think so, yeah. I mean that all plays in it. My ugly people are complaining so much they won't take the time to develop a fucking personality. Right? Some jokes do it. The rest of us have to do like, I don't get mad at Brad Pitt, you know, have it be fucking because he's fucking beautiful.

Speaker 2:          01:34:18       I'm a fucking bald redheaded mail. I know where I am in the pecking order and some of these fucking people who are complaining right now who are mad that beautiful people get treated differently. I understand racially speaking, but you're not going to do the beautiful thing. And then then that's another thing they tried to say, well society tries to, you know, they're the ones that fucking dude like, you know, like I love when there's a supermodel, like did this is like an impossible standard of beauty to try and live up to. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why she's on the cover of a magazine. She's that level beautiful. And you're going to try and sit there and tell me that that was learned. But here's the

Speaker 4:          01:34:57       thing that's only women, because when you see Jason Momoa playing Aquaman, you don't hear men say that's an impossible standard of beauty that we have to.

Speaker 1:          01:35:07       No, I just make fun of that fucking stupid. That trying to hang onto. I don't care how much you can kick my ass. That is the dumbest. She should be on a fucking serial box. It's a change. For years they had a problem like with aqua man, it's like he's in the ocean. Human beings are on earth. Like, what do we like? I have to see that fucking movie. What are they going to be? Is it going to be like Japanese people like fitting? He's sharp. He goes under water. Is that a skin like. Well the bumps. What is that? Is that a suit? Doesn't water getting the gloves have to be all one piece. Right? It would be annoying as shit is any worse than water and your glove. So look, it looks like it catches them like a water catcher. Like not just like water gets in the gloves. It's like a funnel. He looks like a stripper at a Bachelorette party. Does a good one. She pays money. You got a good one. Guy dieted down for that. Um, yes he did and he got all the abs so he's been better than I am. Oh, you hit the button that says this is the fall. Look for one. Yep. This is when he's in the black seat. You know what I mean? He wants to fucking gets cold. Yeah. Did you see

Speaker 4:          01:36:15       so going on in the UK, the UK is banned. Advertisements that feature unobtainable bodies is a,

Speaker 1:          01:36:23       I, it recently, the way they eat fish and chips over there, that's going to be most of advertising. Well they had these ads for summer

Speaker 4:          01:36:30       bodies. You know, you see a girl in a bikini and they're now making it illegal to

Speaker 1:          01:36:36       aspire to that. Like I look at that aqua man guy that makes me want to go to the gym and I'll be like, Ooh, he's good.

Speaker 4:          01:36:43       Full head of hair. Look like you got to make me feel better. It's because the people that complain, who are the people that are complaining, that people to complain to, the people that don't want to work to be that lady, they don't want to work to get that kind of a body and they want to. They just want to not see it. They don't want any. They don't want to go to the subway and see a body that they never got it.

Speaker 1:          01:37:00       Yeah. I saw, I saw an actress complaining one time because the studio total that she needed to lose 15 pounds and like you can't drop 15 to star in a movie. I mean, what, what Karen. Can they specifically carrots? Some veggies in your diet. What do they have to dangle in front of you to go to the fucking gym? Like the rest of us, like I literally like because I say, Oh guys not to deal with that. It's like, yeah, we do. Of course. Yes, we do have to deal with that. I gained 20 pounds to forget about him. If just having five lines in a fucking movie. If I am north of 171 72 pounds to fucking tweets, I get a belly booze bag. Hey Billy Bitch tits. Hey Fat, freckles. All of this shit that I get like I know like they, they sit there and they had like a. they're acting like, like fucking preteens where everything is just everything's about them and the whole fucking world gives a shit. Celebrities what they're fucking political views is the funniest thing ever. It's like

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       all you're, you're not, you're not making anybody changed their mind politically. I think that any of that back in up, it's like, no, you can't have the spotlight on you enough. That's all you're doing because all you're doing with that bullshit is your. First of all, you're alienating half the fucking people that are going to go see whatever the fuck you are in. And then secondly, you're just getting on the radar of lunatics in white vans with two seats that are looking up how to fucking build pipe bombs like that. That's, that's the fallout. It's like a jerk when he goes to average run of the mill, son of a bitch. And already picked Steve Martin,

Speaker 4:          01:38:28       the idea that a girl shouldn't be asked to lose weight, to look hot for movies. Fucking crazy, because that's what you're playing. You're playing a hot woman and there's part of the job

Speaker 2:          01:38:37       and there's millions of everybody's in shape. I remember fucking CNI still a bit about this. I saw a Ben Stiller in, in meet the fockers or something. There was a scene where he had to have his shirt off in the pool. He had fucking abs. Then a comedy because that's because you were seeing the influence of, for the fucking Internet. You know what I mean? It's like, you know, he gets in your head, people just fucking trash and you like, I already knew I was unsightly, but I didn't realize how many things that people didn't enjoy it until I got on the Internet. I was like, wow, I never noticed that about myself. So, um, yeah, I don't have a look. If somebody really has like a fucking eating disorder, you know, I feel like fucking obese. I have separately for those people. But you 15 pounds, 20 pounds fucking and you know, did he drink some fucking smoothies?

Speaker 4:          01:39:25       These women that are playing these roles have to understand first of all, that part of the reason why you got that role is not just because of your acting ability, but also because you're pretty. You have a beautiful face, you were born with it, you didn't even work at it, and then on top of that you're supposed to be playing a beautiful person in the movie. They would like you to not be fat.

Speaker 2:          01:39:42       Well, there's also discrimination is millions of dollars at stake there could be lost. So I always feel like your job is even if you look like me, is to show up on time knowing your lines in the best possible shape you could get yourself in that. That's the role that I. even if I'm just fucking playing

Speaker 4:          01:39:59       Lang, what if you're already laying in the. You're supposed to play the guy that smoking cigarettes and you're the brother in law that's drunk all the time. Then your job's to look that way. Jobs look that way. Her job is looking at the hot woman that everybody wants to fuck. If they're telling you you have to lose weight and you're, you're a beautiful woman, it's because they want to make you more attractive. It's not like discrimination. There's a reason they want a better product and you want to make money.

Speaker 2:          01:40:21       What? I try to get a better product and I'll tell you nothing to like really those both male and female, like those beautiful people at that level. It's like they're fucking aliens. Like I, I've done a couple of movies. I did a movie one time and I remember, uh, it was a scene we were in a car in the star of the movie was holding onto the steering wheel. And I was like, like, I never thought this ever bought a woman. I was like, her forearms are gorgeous. I was looking at me like I was like, those forearms are, but I didn't make me. When I went to Stockholm, Sweden, how beautiful the people were that I was running down the street pointing guys with my wife. Go near, look at that guy. Look at that. That fucking guy, like he's like an accountant walking down the streets like does he know if he fucking came over here, he'd be starring in movies and that's not all the Sweden by the way. That's like just when you're in Stockholm, that's like their Manhattan, so all the beautiful fucking people. But I mean I went into a couple. I went to this magnet pipe, went and bought like a magazine or something like that when I was over there and the woman behind the counter was like a fucking 11 here, but she was working at a magazine stand. So that was her energy. Like, hey, how you doing? I'm working in a magazine stand. My dream hasn't come true yet. And you just look at him like you. You could sign

Speaker 1:          01:41:38       the WHO's that big model or agents? Yeah, like that all. Like Cindy Crawford and all them are with back in the day, the Vikings, it's Viking blood. They the best looking people. They, they went over there and raped and pillaged and all that good DNA is left there. They cut the best women that kept them alive. Killed everybody else. Oh, is that what happened? Huh? I don't know what happened. Biking, so that's why they're so big. Beautiful. Oh yeah. No, that's super helpful. That's one of the funniest things ever. When you go over to like the, what do they call those? The Nordic in Scandinavia is within the Nordic countries. I always have to remind myself that like you'd go over there. It was the funniest fucking shit because it's so god damn tall. There would be kids almost my height whose voices hadn't changed yet and they had the mentality of like an 11 year old and a like,

Speaker 2:          01:42:25       except they was speaking that aged out if we're talking to boys that and change that. And I was just sitting there laughing my ass off because he's like fucking. Yeah, they like, everybody was like, like

Speaker 1:          01:42:36       a, like six, three, six, four, six, five, like rail thin with their fucking shit. European pants. Um, I'm actually going over there. Come on, I'm stuck Stockholm next year, but I'm going over to Europe. I got that. I got to run a 10, 10 days over there. So you're doing a European tour when you do that with three legs of three legs. So you do three separate trips of 10 days. Wow. Yeah. Just because I meeting the family or do you just go solo? Uh, I'm going to bring the family on one of them and then the other ones I'm only gone for a little over a week, which is a really long time when you have a kid and it. And it's not something that uh, I look forward to doing now. But it's something that it's also gives my kid a great life. So that's how I justify it.

Speaker 1:          01:43:20       So then I also, I had to move some shit around to work less in other areas. But um, that's a good balance. I'm glad you approach it that way. You know, I have friends that don't, they, you know, they're on the road all the time and they have kids and you know, there are ideas that this is what I got to do to make a living. I'm like, I guess so, but you know, 30 days in a row it's kind of crazy. I put my kid down for a nap and like, I'll be downstairs for like 20 minutes. I looked at my wife, I'm like, dude, I miss her. It's just, it's so quiet. She's hilarious. She's hilarious. So it's just like a, you know. Um, yeah. And she's an unbelievable sense of humor and uh, yeah. And like she would love it. Yeah. And I always wanted to be and I just was afraid of commitment and all that shit.

Speaker 1:          01:44:07       So I waited. I waited too long. I did wait too long. So, which is why I'm going to take a fucking sauna with you at the end of this. We'll take us on now. Yeah. And I want to learn all, you know, ge would be really be great if there was a company out there that could somehow let me know. I get a sauna in my house. Um, well sauna people out there. I was working with a white snake take. I can get a fucking get a sauna. Sauna, companies contact both of us. Okay. Because I was in contact with a guy to do something in my fucking house in this asshole. Drop the ball and it's not returning emails anymore. So I need a new sonic company to. I call me my free advertisement. Where's the fucking sauna? The Sauna Guy. Get back to us. No, he hasn't gotten back to us.

Speaker 1:          01:44:49       Let me get the fuck them two weeks. Should we get back to him again twice? Got Back to this guy like trying to get the fucking song installed in the house. I love all those guys. Stuff like that. They like Comedians, like they don't want a real job. Contractors. Oh yeah. Oh the gate guy that's on a guy that, this guy, that guy, they all got their little fucking in the handyman guys. Um, well I grew up with those guys because my dad was an architect so I did construction from the time I was in high school all throughout the summer. I was always doing side jobs. I always had jobs on construction sites as a laborer. Carpenters assistance. I was always around those guys. I tried to do that. I lasted eight days. I just, with my fucking fair skin. We were doing roofing and July and it was just.

Speaker 1:          01:45:31       I just remember my job was I was putting in the scaffold and going around, you know, when you fucking drill the hole, then you put the triangle thing and then you fucking put the bolt on. This Irish guy kept going, billy, you must work quicker, you much more quickly because what kept saying to me and I finally stuck my head out the side of the house. I was like, dude, I've done this for three days. If you want me to fucking go quicker, you know, we would like literally three stories up. And he finally shut the fuck up. He must be a non union guy. Uh Oh yeah dude. I remember there was a fucking guy on the site, I swear to God, he wore the same fucking jeans everyday with like no underwear. Right? And it had a fucking giant fucking hole right here on his thigh.

Speaker 1:          01:46:11       So I'm in fucking working in the house and I just remember he stepped over something with this left leg in the whole fucking whole moved, right? Just like flashed his fucking junk. I was just like. And I did not stand up to people. And Plus Elsie and I was the new guy on the thing and I just was wanting to be like, buddy, how about you put on some fucking boxers or something so I don't get to look at your fucking job. First of all, he's walking around with like a Goddamn nail gun now. Like boxers could stop that, but any extra layer of clothing that you could have. This guys literally like his fucking Shit, you know, like an hour. We'll look it out of a tree

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       and it's burned into my head. I could pick his junk out of a lineup.

Speaker 4:          01:46:57       That was the first time I ever encountered alcoholics. I didn't know really know about alcoholics until I started working on job sites and I realized that there was guys that just had a drink your drink at lunch that was drinking all the time and they were always trying to quit. I remember one guy who was like, I'm quitting, I'm done. And I remember thinking, that's good. You got your shit together, you know, I was 15. I was like, oh, that's awesome. Yeah, two weeks later, fucking can of beer on the job. I was like, oh,

Speaker 2:          01:47:20       I just remember I couldn't. Yeah, I couldn't eat enough. I was always hungry. Pack two sandwiches, three sandwiches and he just put like, like you were the most real world content. Yeah, that's what people used to do. No, those were like those guys. I mean I would come home like it was like I went to football practice. It was just, it just, I, I, I, if I stuck around for another month, I could've gotten construction workers shape. I was, but I just sucked at it. I just didn't have it. And then that was one of the things how I was able to figure out what I was good at was one of my best attributes is I knew when I sucked at something like take playing drums and I wanted to be an abandoned anything. I just went to too many music stores and I'd see some seven year old kid and just him starting to play or picking up a guitar.

Speaker 2:          01:48:07       I just knew it. I was just like, I don't have that. I don't have that gift, you know? Even if I played better than just the ideas that they were already coming up with, um, speaking of which do I should have called you the other day, I saw Dave Nevara does this thing with his band royal machines. It's like they just do this Christmas show every year. And uh, and went with Ben Bailey the other night at the El Rey. Do what a fucking show these guys put on. Like Sebastian Bach came out and sang highway to hell, fucking murder. Do Juliette Lewis, you know, from fucking American. Uh, uh, what the fuck was that? All the, all the edits, the serial killer movie with Woody Harrelson. Know what the fuck was that after going natural born killers. Although you know, all of those fucking moved dude, you know, some people like I'm a comedian who happens to play drums.

Speaker 2:          01:48:53       Dude, she's a fucking Rockstar who happens to act really? Dude. Oh my God. Really? Oh my God. It was so ridiculous. I was just laughing how fucking amazing she was. She sang like Van Halen aint talking about love. And then she sang dirty deeds and it was all just in the wheelhouse of Shit that I listened to and I want to say she did one more and then in the end she did like a fucking forward somersault into the fucking crowd. Whoa. It was just fucking. Is there video this? Um, I dunno. I was, you know, the band was so fucking good. And then the drummers they had, I was Josh Freese, Chad Smith and Brad Wilk, like, so, you know, if you're into dramas, that's just recent fucking play with everybody. Literally everybody, uh, Brad Wilk was in rage against the machine and uh,

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       and Chad Smith is in the chili peppers and those guys would just fucking destroying. And um, who they had steve Stevens for, billy idol's band was out there. All these fucking guys. It's just like, wow. Yeah. If you get a chance they will kind of talk. And like it was the last year they were going to do what? I hope it isn't. But Mark Mcgrath also was there who was fucking hilarious. He sort of like the like, you know, you know, he sings the songs great, but he's also like sort of the emc slash comedian. He's a really, really naturally like funny guy. Like he, I would say with another comedian, he was cracking us up. He went on to be like an entertainment reporter. Right? Yeah. Well the thing about him is he's like, he was either, I feel like he was always like a self deprecating. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:50:30       Like he was writing hit songs, like who the fuck can do that? And he nicknamed an album like 1459, like making fun, like my 15 minutes are almost like he was like roasting himself while he was just writing one hit after another, after another. And uh, I've gotten to meet him a couple times. He's like one of the fucking great people that I've met in this business. Yeah Dude. And he's a fucking riot. He's a fucking funny. Yeah. So if you get to see guys like that and you go, why don't you just do stand up? Why do you want to work these fucking gigs? Working for entertainment television, pretending to give a shit about some stupid sitcom. Just go do it. Well, how much of a chance when people give them because Oh, you're the sugar ray guy. Me Probably got enough shit, you know, like he's just one of those really like, uh, just this finally found some doing rage.

Speaker 3:          01:51:24       That was funny. So there's Navarro that I think that's Brad Wilk on drums, whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:51:36       But he was making fun of himself before he came out there because I forget who's following these go like, I know, I know now you got to listen to the Douche from sugary so it just totally makes fun of himself and his love is. Then he goes up and he fucking murders it. Wow. So it's just kinda like, ah, I'm like, he just reminded me of like a, like a comedian or whatever. So you get to hang out with Juliette Lewis? Um, no. I, I, I have before. She's cool as shit. I want to meet her. Oh, she's cool too. We've gone back and forth online together. I was trying to get her on the podcast a few years ago when I dropped the ball. Oh, well. I was always worried that people like that would worry that I just want to harp on scientology because she, you know, she's like a crazy scientologists I grew up Catholic, but what the fuck they did and still doing. Yeah. No, listen, I hear you, but I think she's still active to get sensitive about that shit. I was thinking of going back to church. Really? Yeah. Just in my own way. How you can do it. I'm going to go, but I'm not going to listen to anything and I'll, I'll, I'll stand up and sit down. You're to get mad if they use certain

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       inflections.

Speaker 2:          01:52:47       No, but I'm just going to kind of go there. It's just a place. I don't know. I, I, I went last year with my mother in law because she goes every weekend when we went for Christmas mass and they had like this New Orleans band and I was like, dude, if I had this every fucking week as a band sounded great. I would go. But like I, I did, it just sort of reminded me of like, I used to be a better person. I was so jaded, you know, I used to go every fucking week.

Speaker 4:          01:53:10       You think you're jaded from not going to church or just. I think you jaded just from knowing too much. Yeah. And just,

Speaker 2:          01:53:19       you know, it's just certain things just get out of control. You know, what it is is when you become an adult, you have to be your own parent, which is weird. Like, hey bill, it's time to go to bed. Hey Bill, lay off the booze and just the um, you know, just certain things just kind of get out of whack, you know, almost like the mixer you life, you know, something's up too high or too low. And I just felt like going there reminded me, you know, so it's a nice reminder for the week, like, hey, you know how, but you're not be a for the next couple of days. That's what I get out of it. I don't get like, you know, this guy walked on water and you know, this is the right thing, you know, if you believe this, you got to go to heaven. And if you know, if somebody believes something else that go into all of that stuff,

Speaker 4:          01:54:00       just silly. That's the way you put it, as a good way of putting it, that you have to be your own parent when you become an adult. That's a great way of putting it because one of the things that you get from, whether it's god or any kind of spirituality, so you get this idea that something's bigger than you. Something's higher than you. There's a higher purpose and you think about that instead of being selfish and just thinking about

Speaker 2:          01:54:22       that's what it is. You can get like a, you know, being a comic, not selling tickets is one of the most humbling things ever. And then once you start selling tickets, you know, you can kinda keep, can kind of float away a little bit and just like, you know, like all the fucking bullshit that you had to go through, you know, finding a flight you can afford and how am I, you know, what fucking dirty cat hair car they're going to pull up in to take them to the comedy condo that was always cat hair, right? And then all of that goes away and then, you know, you just have this free time and like, what are you going to do with it and this free time and this privilege that you have and you can really go roman empire with it and fucking eat and drink and smoke and be a f, you know, and just be a jerk, um, or you can, uh, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:55:14       you can still be who the fuck be as much as who you were or whatever or trying to help somebody out. I just, that's what it makes me think of when, when I went like I was because I got so caught up in like, this is bullshit that never happened. They made that up, this is just people writing this book and I went totally the other way. So now I'm coming in the middle. Like there's a reason why people do this beyond trying to control people and make money and power and all that. There is, there is something to it. So there's a benefit for the people that have. Yeah. Yes. So

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       that's kind of what I was going there. It's humbling. It's kind of like what I left La and I'm like never spoken to view again. And then I started going back and they felt it pulling me back like, hey, you know, this isn't that bad. I'm like, ah, fuck, I kinda like it. So I went back to church with my mother in law and I was sitting there going like, there's an aspect of this that I liked. I liked the sense of community. Um, you know, I didn't mind the little pep talk that the guy gives her whatever. It would be nice

Speaker 4:          01:56:11       if I didn't, didn't think if I wasn't suspicious of them. The problem with church is the problem with anybody that gets in any sort of a position of power, it's easy to abuse it. So the have a guy who, a pastor that's not a creep, that really cares and is really a good person and really wants to care about the community and really wants everybody to do better and get better with life, but isn't trying to buy a fucking Rolls Royce like Joel Olsteen and live in a giant mansion. It's like

Speaker 1:          01:56:39       mega church. It always goes. It always goes south. It's absolutely love about Joel Osteen is he's an arena act as a preacher. He's um, he bought the old place, the old arena where the, uh, the Houston Rockets used to play. He bought it. Yeah. That's so much money that guy has. And then he fills it up. Yeah. Well that was one them, when the hurricane came, people criticized him because he didn't open up his doors to all the folks who were displaced from their homes. I was teasing them about that. It's like you saw that electric blue carpet he put on anything. What do Yo, you fucking guys getting it all wet? No, he does. He has a sick ass look at that place. Maybe it's the curtain that I thought. Yeah. I mean look at that fucking place. Holy Shit. Yeah. That looks like a dice clay special and all those people is thrown down. All those people are paying to be there. Okay. Is want to somebody out there scalping tickets. I got to buy the alter. It was two ways

Speaker 4:          01:57:34       it right. One is these getting all those people together and there's a sense of community amongst all of them. And two is that guy's making a fuck load of money and he's got so much power.

Speaker 1:          01:57:44       No, you and all those people just at your. But it doesn't mean you're necessarily a bad. That doesn't necessarily mean he's like, what? What can you do with it? Which is getting the reason why I'm thinking, uh, you know, stopping in every once in a while.

Speaker 4:          01:57:57       Good spot. Like they were doing that rock and roll church thing for awhile. There was a, I remember one of my friends who's a producer, his assistant was, she was lost. She, I think she,

Speaker 1:          01:58:08       I want to spiritually or she was lost a lot of ways, but she was doing this. What's going on Jamie? Price for what? Four thousand $950 for the author to. Do you want to go? What the fuck? Yeah, we could do that with 1,400 bucks. No, no, no, no. Four thousand $950 ticket for two tickets. Right. Sanction for row row. Dod. Dude. For Grant and what? That guy fucking. That's not even if I catch the handkerchief when he's done fucking preaching how much I get for a row to or

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       not available. Not available. So now he's a resale tickets to know what it is, man. They got fucking season passes. People probably buy season passes to Joel Olsteen says to tour. This was for this. Florida stopped. Well, I saw there was a place that I was at that he was coming to one of them. One of the big spots I was at. He does these arena tours and he does vegas too. We does the fucking t mobile arena in Vegas. I want to see a picture of him up there. His eyes open, smiling and shit. It's crazy. It's a lot of money that guys make. I used to say he's so full of Shit. He can't look at the crowd. That's eyes. Eyes are still here. Are they still believe in this ship when you lie in eye contact is the toughest fucking thing ever. But whatever.

Speaker 4:          01:59:26       He's. He's making people feel good and he's making fuck. He's in show business. I want to see the show though. He's in the God show Biz. You have. You have to respect an arena act I think. I think there's something to that. There's something to do that. It's a girl that was talking about. She was lost and I think she was Jewish or maybe she converted to Judaism later, but anyway, for one point in time she was going to the rock and roll church. She was like, she was a sweet kid. She was like, you should go. You would really like it. I'm like a guarantee. I wouldn't like it. I'm like, wait. Some young hip guy probably sing songs. Probably tries to fuck women, like get Outta here with that. Right? Like a yoga class. It's like David Koresh. Waco got started. How did it get started?

Speaker 4:          02:00:05       Get started with one guy with a guitar and he brought that message of Jesus and he had some really profound things to say and people really, really helped them feel better. Resonated with them. Then he started banging people's wives and that's what happens. It always happens. Yeah. Well those rock and roll alternative churches, there's a few of the. Like the Justin Bieber Guy? No, the guy that a justin bieber has, he's the one that told Justin to get off the road, get off the road. Justin, come back home to Jesus like he's getting. He gets these guys to do a basketball player. Stopped playing basketball to play with. No, no, no, no, no, no. That guy's not doing the road anymore. He goes back and forth. It took a little time off or something like the end of this tour. Canceled his tour because of the preacher told him it's when.

Speaker 4:          02:00:48       Maybe he's right though. Let's be honest. First of all, bieber probably has a fucking billion dollars in the bank and maybe he was frayed around the edges is losing his fucking marbles. The kid's 21 years old. He's about as famous as a human being. Could possibly he only 21. He's young. There's the preacher will go, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. What the fucking Dick Route. Hold up. See what. See what's going on with his fucking shorts. Brow. No, no, no, no, no, no. Any guy who show and Dick Route. You know what I mean? Like the base of your cock. You're pulling your shorts down to base your cock like that. You're doing that because he's trying to get laid. Stop. Pull your shorts up to a normal height. Those things should be five inches higher. I know what you're doing. Your, your cock is slapping against your thing. You probably don't even have underwear on you fucking creep. Jesus does not want you dressing like that. No. Look at them. It's got abs, big old, handsome guy. He probably Dixie chicks down for the Lord, right? Dick's Dick's, some down for Jesus and it's really them. Big Old, handsome, charismatic guy, taking them down for Jesus. Apparently he's a very. He's a host. Good Daniel with Oprah. So you know he's legit.

Speaker 1:          02:02:06       They're all in the same business selling homes.

Speaker 4:          02:02:11       I hope you enjoy. Hey, maybe he's good at it. You know, maybe he's got something. Maybe helps people. I'm suspicious. I'm suspicious because of his shorts. Just that alone. That should be on the wall all over his church. This is me at my worst. Well, the worst thing you did

Speaker 1:          02:02:24       do what is an adult is to go out and try and find parents again. That's the quickest way to end up in the trunk of somebody's fucking car. It's fine. Find someone to take care of you. Yeah. Well you see, if you didn't see your parents didn't pay attention to or overly coddled you, I think. Then you go out and you start looking for a mom and a dad, a mom and a dad and a mom and a dad, and you just give away all this fucking power.

Speaker 4:          02:02:46       I don't give power away to someone who shows Dick route when they pulled her shorts down to the base of their cock like that. Like as far as you can legally get your shorts down without showing your Dick. As long as the pubes are trimmed. I don't think it's okay. It's all right. That's interesting. Right? It will be a problem. Cause chaos down there and he pulled it out. You could see the chaos, like basically that's, that's. There's a lot of pubes that you could see right there. You could see a lot of pubes, but if you did it would be a real issue. Isn't that interesting? The same exact area is okay if you're only seeing skin, but if you saw pubes right there, you'd be like, hey man, what in the fuck? What are you doing that is so

Speaker 1:          02:03:26       not acceptable in public that like that is a. that's almost like the male version of a thong guy could wear a thong but might be worse. But it's funny though, Lisa, if you have a thong on you just a freak, right? I'm a freak. Oh No. I, to be honest with naked guy, always funny. It's pretty funny. Naked. Sure. It depends. Depends on the central guy. Well, if you're alone and somebody jumped out of a Bush, I mean that's fucking. That's not a funny naked guy, but he went back in the day when streaking when a guy would jump out and run across a football field. It was the funniest. It was just the funniest fucking thing to tackle. The guy now he's had it. They always had a silly hat and they would just start fucking running across

Speaker 4:          02:04:11       and I would always get me the fee. I would. I would tense up when I'd see them tackle them because I would think about his dick is raw. Dick's smashing into the

Speaker 1:          02:04:19       dirt. I saw guy, I saw a guy when I was at Boston University terriers game. They don't even play soccer anymore. Nickerson field and my fault. My Godfather took me to the game and we were sitting in this fucking. Elliot was abandoned on and he was streaking across the field and we will fucking crying. Laughing.

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       Insecurity was chasing was really fast. He had a Bandana and like these fucking like a date as dragons. It was way back in the day, right. Getting ran across and he tried to jump over this fucking concrete thing and he didn't land with this junk. It was his inner thigh on the other one. He got over and he and as far as I know, he got away, but I mean dude, it was just, it wasn't even like, it wasn't a nice concrete. Was that rough unfinished shit. And he tried to hurdle it and he got a. He got his junk. You got everything over and it was that other let other leg.

Speaker 4:          02:05:12       Nice fucking raspberry. It's amazing how vulnerable your Dick is. Dick and balls. Just just simple, simple trip with no pants on and slammed down on your Dick and he horrible.

Speaker 2:          02:05:25       You would think there'd be some sort of junk rib cage

Speaker 4:          02:05:31       to try and to try and protect it, but it just started a turtle shell. No, it is. It's just fucking just out there. Just out there. Yeah. It's a terrible design and that's why the function is. I mean, it has to go. In no case you didn't notice because you haven't been using your Dick, you know what? It's for it. So it's something that someone has got it. Something's got to be vulnerable, you know, like the death star because your temperature, that's what it's for. Temperature. Your body heats up too much, kills your sperm. So if your balls were internal and you were running around exercise and you'd cook all your sperm so their balls are hanging low on the outside. Oh well why can't it go like in and out, like one of those electric antennas? Maybe in the future. It will. Yeah, maybe.

Speaker 4:          02:06:14       Yeah. People keep evolving. You find a way to suck it up into your body. That was the thing that we always hear about. [inaudible], which was a very particular hardstyle. Karate and guys would literally get kicked in the balls. It would kick each other in the balls. And the idea was that, uh, an under some dubious instructors. The idea was that these guys could actually suck their testicles up into their body. Like they would train to pull their testicles up into their body. And one day I talked to a doctor and he's like, that's not possible. No, it is like, no. But they think they can, but there's some guys can develop the ability to take a shot to the nuts. Like there's been studies done on it. There was a one of those, a sports science shows. Well these guys, they measured like the amount of force that a guy's throwing it at this guy's Dick when he punched him in the Dick and the I stand in it like this.

Speaker 4:          02:07:02       He lets people just fucking straight up, punched them right in the balls and he can take effect his dad. It's definitely not good. There's a trick to it. There's certainly a trick. The trick would be that even though you are definitely making contact with the balls, really most of the forces in the taint and the back of the ass because as you know, you're kicking somebody, right? Your foot is extends past where your Shin is, right? Your Shin is here, your foot is here. So if your foot is slamming into the guy's ass and taint, it's really not. A lot of them. I have, I've been kicked in the balls at least 100 times hard by grown men who know how to kick butt like black belts. I've been kicked in the balls so many times because when you're sparring, you get kicked in the balls all the time.

Speaker 4:          02:07:51       I mean, all the time you'll probably just get used to the pace. I thought before I had kids, I thought I'd probably put my fucking balls are probably totally useless. I'm like, I'm shooting blanks for sure. I just thought of all the times I've been slammed into the balls I've. I mean I've had. I've worn every fucking cup there is. Especially back when I was competing. They didn't like now they have some pretty sophisticated cups with like diamond mma is this cup that's got a compression short and it sucks down into you and it's really hard rubber on the outside and you can actually take a good shot to the balls and it's not going to kill you. But back when I was doing it, he would get those jocks who just be a cup that fits in a jock strap and you pull them up and then eventually they made some for martial arts where it just curved under a little bit more and the cup went back to your taint. And the, the downside of that was it, it was, there was a lot of uh, abrasiveness. When you're throwing kicks, it will like rub against your inner thigh. And there was no compression shorts back then either. But I have absolutely been fucking bet everything I have, I've been kicked in the balls 100 times. A No question about it.

Speaker 3:          02:08:56       They should take like a fucking, you know, like they do like a mold. They should do a mold of your junk custom. They should remember that group of use of like a mold of like all the rock stars, Dicks, like a fleshlight for porn stars. You can do that. So they would secure. Yeah. I don't know. A gross look on your face and I just. Yeah, I, I get, I get weirded out by. I get weirded out by that shit. Flashlights. Yeah. Like once this, the non human element in gay, you want to fuck this thing that isn't alive. There's just something like, you know. Yeah. That's just fucking. This is my asshole is a rubber version of my asshole. I. Yeah. I always, I always, yeah. Going back in the day when you had wanted to get porn, you had to go into a store. I just, this stuff always, it just seemed serial killer, like body part type dehumanizing. It's very effective though with the flashlight was a sponsor for awhile when I remember the days. Yeah. Those things were great. I stopped using them now even though like I try it, I had to try it after awhile. The listeners. Oh yeah. That's it only for the list. It's very effective. Okay. You know about this? What's that? It's called ankle.

Speaker 3:          02:10:22       What? Oh, Jesus Christ. I mean, how do you not like become like, how does that not do brain to fuck that?

Speaker 1:          02:10:36       Oh Jesus. That's so disgusting. Can you. You think it's bad getting caught jerking off. Can you imagine if you swam in this foot and 10 fucking. First of all, it looks real enough that you fucking killed somebody and now you fucking. Oh my God, you could fuck a whole leg. That it's crazy how realistic that looks. It looks like she's hanging from the ceiling through. This has like the skin of her heel. It looks like it's kind of mushy a little bit. Right? Like it's moving around because I want this site might get a little weirder to this as you can build your own mannequin here. So let's just get the fuck outta here. Yeah, we are a. we're like, what are you doing? I'm in synthetics. That's what that's called. Synthetics. Like parachutes and stuff. Something like that. Something, something like that. What is it? A a one hour fucking elbow get. No, here's my business card.

Speaker 1:          02:11:34       I Dunno. That's when I think you buy that in a few weeks later, you buy a giant freezer. Just think you're going down that road. Yeah. It ain't good. That's not good. Which I honestly think like there's so many people that had tendencies that never when you're just living in log cabins and shit, like he just never were able to explore. And I, I feel like the same way, you know, I can watch all these people building cars and stuff or you can tap into some dark shit about yourself and uh, you know, the thing opens the coffin lid and sits up and then that's in your fucking personality. Now it's, it's a very, it's a very, uh, I don't know. I, I try to stay away from shit like that. Well, especially if your kid has been abused that I think that's the real trigger. Real triggers. Kids that get abused, they get abused young and then they developed this anger, this hatred, and then as they get older, then they find these weird outlets and then they pursue them meal now. Yeah. I can attest to a lot of them basically described my fucking life. Um, so anyways, we going to fucking. Let's go get in the sauna. Let's do it. We'll wrap this up. Ladies and gentlemen. Jesus Christ. Now be looking at your fucking foot when I'm in there.
